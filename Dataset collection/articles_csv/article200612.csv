"'06-12-01,'0','Every so often “3 Needles,” an ambitious, frustrating Canadian film that examines the AIDS epidemic on three continents, throws up its hands and directs its befuddled gaze at the moon. As pretty as that orb appears, the notion of the moon contemplated by miserable earthlings all around the world is too banal a metaphor for global togetherness to wield much clout. You wish the time had been devoted to clarifying the movie’s barely sketched characters and situations on terra firma.Had it taken a more hard-headed approach, “3 Needles,” written and directed by Thom Fitzgerald (“The Hanging Garden”), a New York-born filmmaker based in Halifax, Nova Scotia, might have been to the AIDS epidemic what “Traffic” was to the drug trade.Its moony poeticism is underscored by the sporadic narration of Olympia Dukakis, who plays a nun in the last of the movie’s three stories. Her character, Sister Hilde, a missionary working in South Africa, delivers the movie’s summary benediction: a rambling, eccentric message from the great beyond that makes the film’s closing note of cosmic compassion ring painfully flat. Before that, the tone of the movie gyrates wildly: mystical one minute, smirking with a weird gallows humor the next.But when it bothers to screw in the nuts and bolts of its vignettes, “3 Needles” evokes a sorrowful vision of the world in which AIDS (the word is never heard in the film) advances because of human frailty. The cinematography (by Thomas M. Harting) is also splendidly panoramic, in the mode of Claire Denis’s “Beau Travail.”All three tales illustrate how ignorance, greed, fear and superstition have fed the epidemic.The film, which uses five languages — English, Mandarin, Xhosi, French and Afrikaans — begins with a prologue, a tribal initiation rite in which African boys are led into a forest and circumcised to mark their passage into manhood. It then embarks on a circuitous global trek that leaps from China to Canada (Montreal) and back to Africa (in a different setting from the prologue).In rural China Jin Ping (Lucy Liu), a blood smuggler, ventures into the backwaters, where she pays impoverished farmers $5 a pint to donate. In one village Tong Sam (Tanabadee Chokpikultong), who grows rice, is rejected as a donor because he has the flu, and insists that his young daughter donate in his stead. The girl, along with everybody else in the village who gives blood, soon sickens and dies.'"
"'06-12-01,'0','WASHINGTON, Dec. 1 — Incoming House speaker Nancy Pelosi today named Representative Silvestre Reyes of Texas to become next chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, ending weeks of closed-door lobbying and public posturing among top candidates for the post.By choosing Mr. Reyes, a Vietnam veteran and former Border Patrol agent who has served on the committee since 2001, Ms. Pelosi passed over the panel’s top Democrat, Rep. Jane Harman of California, with whom Ms. Pelosi has long feuded.Unlike Ms. Harman, who since the Sept. 11 attacks has been one of the Democratic party’s most outspoken and visible members on issues of war and terrorism, Mr. Reyes has a much lower profile in national security circles.Ms. Pelosi had privately criticized Ms. Harman for not more aggressively challenging the White House on issues such as the faulty intelligence leading to the war in Iraq and the National Security Agency’s domestic surveillance program. In a statement released today, she made it clear that she expects Mr. Reyes to make oversight of such controversial programs a priority.“His appreciation for the dangers inherent in the operation of secret activities in a democracy ensures that he will be a zealous protector of the civil liberties that define us as a nation,” she said.'"

The retrial was held this week in Shandong, and a local judge announced the verdict on Friday morning, lawyers said.

"'06-12-01,'0','That said, the fact that Mr. McCain decided to fly here for three days and spend $50,000 on a reception that lathered governors with platters of shrimp and three open bars suggests just how much Mr. Romney has complicated his efforts to position himself as the inevitable nominee.Mr. Romney politely deferred questions about 2008 when he appeared at a news conference with about 12 other governors who spent much of the session analyzing the reasons for the Republican defeats on Nov. 7 and what needed to be done to get the party back on track.“We’re not getting into ’08 considerations at this press briefing,” he said.But Mr. McCain’s team was only too glad to oblige, saying they were scooping up tentative endorsements on Mr. Romney’s watch.“We have a number of governors who are committed to John, but we are not ready to announce them yet,” said John Weaver, Mr. McCain’s senior political adviser.Mr. Weaver strode slowly and conspicuously through the Doral lobby, teeming with governors, aides and Washington Republican consultants.Mr. Romney’s aides disputed Mr. Weaver’s statement, and indeed, it would not be out of character for Mr. Weaver to be exaggerating a bit as part of a strategy to persuade recalcitrant governors to jump on a departing train.Mr. McCain, in an interview on Thursday evening, said he was in no way invading Mr. Romney’s territory.“I’ve known these guys for years,” he said. “I’ve campaigned for these people. I don’t see how that’s anybody’s territory.”All this provided a fair amount of entertainment and helped leaven a meeting that was otherwise filled with somber assessments of the recent election that saw Republicans swept out of power in Congress.The Republican National Committee chairman, Ken Mehlman, warned against viewing the losses as a temporary setback created by a tough electoral environment.“We can’t simply write this election off as preordained, as the natural order of things to be automatically rectified in two years,” Mr. Mehlman said, warning that the party has to figure out ways to increase its appeal.This very exclusive group that Mr. McCain and Mr. Romney are fighting over was also diminished in the election. There will be just 22 Republican governors next year, compared with 28 now.Governors’ support has historically proved important in primary battles and general elections. Besides the presumed prestige of endorsements, governors can deliver political machines, troves of contributors and control over state offices like boards of elections.The success of Mr. Bush, then governor of Texas, at establishing himself as a front-runner early in the 2000 race developed in no small part because he became the favorite candidate of Republican governors.“Often more than House members and senators, governors have state structures and can make significant impacts in their state,” Mr. Weaver said.Mr. McCain’s schedule included meetings on Thursday and Friday morning with the governors of Alabama, Mississippi, Indiana, Kentucky, North and South Dakota, Texas and Vermont.Gov. Tim Pawlenty of Minnesota drove to the evening reception with Mr. McCain and later said in an interview he intended to support Mr. McCain if he ran for president.Still, several governors said in interviews they would not be making a decision this early.“I don’t know who a single governor is supporting,” said Gov. Haley Barbour of Mississippi, a former chairman of the Republican National Committee.Mr. Barbour did say, though, that Mr. Romney, whose duties as head of the Republican Governors Association included handing out checks to Republican candidates for governor, was popular with this group of Republicans.“Everybody likes him, and he did a very good job,” he said. “But look, nobody can assume anything.”The guest list for Mr. McCain’s reception included Mr. Romney and his political team. They sent their regrets, saying they were too busy with the affairs of the conference.Mr. Romney was in a bit of a tricky position. On one hand, aides said, he did not want to look as if he was commandeering the association as a campaign tool, particularly when some of Mr. McCain’s supporters have been suggesting that he was guilty of precisely that.That said, Mr. Romney’s tenure as head of this group is one reason that he is viewed as being so strongly positioned for 2008. The post has allowed him to travel around the country, including visits to important states like Iowa, appearing before Republican activists and earning good will with the same candidates, elected officials and state party leaders who are going to be critical in winning battles.A spokesman for Mr. Romney, Eric Fehrnstrom, said the governor was not available for comment on Mr. McCain’s political activities.“Governor Romney’s focused on his speech, which looks at a new generation of challenges facing America and what we must do to meet them,” Mr. Fehrnstrom said. “It makes sense for Senator McCain to be here honoring Republican governors, because as a group they are fiscally conservative and innovators in education and health care policy. The answers to many of the challenges facing our nation can be found in what they are doing every day.”'"
"'06-12-01,'0','“It is a bunch of warmed-over, impractical ideas, many of which have been kicking around for a long time,” said Richard C. Breeden, a former S.E.C. chairman who now runs Breeden Capital Management, a $1.3 billion hedge fund. “It is very elegant whining.”The governor-elect of New York, Eliot Spitzer, who as the state’s attorney general battled Wall Street and often the S.E.C., vowed to fight the proposals. “I will personally appear on Capitol Hill and appear with tens of thousands of investors to defend against these wayward and wrong-headed proposals,” he said.“This is the same old tired response from the defenders of the status quo who time and again jump to eviscerate the prosecutorial power of the only office who did anything in the past decade,” he said.Other groups felt the report did not go far enough. The National Venture Capital Association said the recommendations would do little to mitigate the burden on small companies of Section 404, which requires audits of internal controls.“As currently written, the committee’s recommendations are not sufficient and will do little to support the emerging enterprises we are trying to protect,” the association said.Mr. Breeden criticized the make-up of the committee, a bipartisan collection of academics and business leaders including R. Glenn Hubbard, dean of the Columbia Business School and a former chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under President Bush; Kenneth Griffin, founder and chief executive of Citadel Investment Group, a $13 billion hedge fund, and John L. Thornton, chairman of the Brookings Institution and a former co-president of Goldman Sachs. Samuel A. DiPiazza Jr., global chief executive of PriceWaterhouseCoopers, and William G. Parrett, chief of Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu, were also members.But the committee did not include any former regulators.“They didn’t think it was a conflict to have two sitting C.E.O.’s of Big Four firms making recommendations to cap the liabilities of accounting firms but they thought it would be inappropriate to have anyone who has worked at the S.E.C. commenting on the practicality of it,” Mr. Breeden said.Mr. Scott had earlier said that he was concerned about including regulators who might have played a role in drafting rules that would be discussed in the group. “We would not want to put people in the position who had formulated these rules in the past,” he said. “They may have a lack of objectivity.”Some critics contested the report’s assumption that the United States was losing competitiveness. The report cited that 5 percent of the total value of global initial public offerings was raised in the United States last year compared with 50 percent in 2000. It also cited the huge fundraising efforts by private equity firms as evidence that the American public markets have become burdened by regulatory risks and costs.“We have noticed that when we invest in a foreign company, and it comes time to go public, the companies are more reluctant to do that here than ever,” said Wilbur Ross, a member of the committee.But critics challenged that point. Mr. Spitzer said it was poor management by public companies that was fueling the private equity boom, not regulatory burdens. “It’s not a problem with the public markets,” he said. “There has been failed leadership.”Others pointed out that many big recent I.P.O.’s have been listed in their home countries like China, where markets have become more developed.Initial seed capital for the report was provided by Mr. Ross and Mr. Griffin, according to Mr. Ross. Each individual provided about $200,000.The group had additional financial support from the Starr Foundation, according to Mr. Scott. Maurice R. Greenberg, who controls the foundation, has been a vocal critic of regulators. He ran American International Group for more than 40 years when investigations by the New York attorney general and S.E.C. over improper accounting led the board to force him to resign.'"
"'06-12-01,'0','GROTON, Conn., Nov. 30 — Pfizer executives told investors Thursday that they hoped to ask federal regulators next year to approve torcetrapib, a heart drug crucial to the company’s future, despite evidence that the drug increases blood pressure.Pfizer also slightly raised its profit projections for 2006, while promising that it would triple the number of drug compounds in late-stage development by 2009 and introduce four new medicines a year beginning in 2011.In addition, Pfizer said it would make it easier for the public to track its development program by offering twice-a-year updates on the progress of almost all the drugs in its pipeline.Shares in Pfizer, the world’s largest drug company, rallied more than 2 percent.Jami Rubin, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, said that investors were hoping that Jeffrey B. Kindler, Pfizer’s new chief executive, would be able to cut costs while freeing the company’s scientists to bring drugs to market more quickly.Still, Pfizer shares are trading at a lower price-earnings multiple than other big drug stocks, a sign that investors believe Mr. Kindler has a difficult road ahead, Ms. Rubin said.'"

"'06-12-01,'0','THIS week, a big hedge fund announced a big bond offering, which might sound like a big snooze. Considering the origins of most of Wall Street’s biggest blow-ups — liquidity crises — it shouldn’t be.Citadel Finance, a unit of the Citadel Investment Group, a $12 billion hedge fund, disclosed on Monday that it intended to raise as much as $2 billion in bonds — a first in the industry. It follows the announcement that the Fortress Investment Group, a giant alternative investment group with billions in hedge funds, private equity and loans, is going public, another first for the United States markets. Both announcements suggest that hedge funds, at least a handful of them, are giving up some of their coveted privacy in exchange for more stable capital.These funds are growing up.Fortress was clear why it wanted to go public: it gets permanent capital, a currency — the stock — to do deals and pay employees and a sense, however ethereal, of physical permanence.The reasoning behind Citadel’s effort to raise debt is more subtle, but equally significant: liquidity management. When the financial world implodes, as it inevitably does, Citadel does not want to be at the mercy of its banks, who at those moments of crisis are likely to be less generous with financing.Liquidity management is not insignificant for hedge funds. Investors give a hedge fund money to manage. But they can redeem that money, depending on the terms of the fund, if the investments go bad. A fund can collapse when bad investments lead to investor redemptions, which in turn force managers to sell positions, often into deteriorating markets, to meet those redemptions. The banks, which manage funds’ accounts, see the deterioration and force tougher financing conditions or call in the loans. Death comes quickly in such cases.'"
"'06-12-01,'0','Their appeals to shareholders’ rights won both applause and criticism for challenging Japan’s insider-run corporate establishment. A 47-year-old former trade ministry official who favored dark suits, Mr. Murakami appeared a more mature and calculating figure than Mr. Horie, 34, a boyish maverick who wore T-shirts and drove Ferraris.Mr. Murakami is charged with having bought shares in Nippon Broadcasting, a radio network, after Mr. Horie told him that Mr. Horie’s company, Livedoor, intended to make a takeover bid. Before his arrest, Mr. Murakami told a packed news conference that Mr. Horie had informed him of the bid in advance, but he said he did not take Mr. Horie seriously at the time.On Thursday, Mr. Murakami repeated his version, telling the court he did not believe Mr. Horie had the financial resources to mount such a bid.Mr. Murakami told the court that he had been purchasing shares of Nippon Broadcasting “from before.”“It was not based on any information about a large purchase by Livedoor,” he said.According to prosecutors, Mr. Murakami’s investment fund bought 9.95 billion yen worth of Nippon Broadcasting shares after the meeting with Mr. Horie on Nov. 8, 2004. Prosecutors told the court that the fund sold the shares for a 3 billion yen profit days after Livedoor announced its bid in February 2005.If convicted, Mr. Murakami faces up to three years in prison or a fine of up to 3 million yen, about $26,000.Mr. Horie, whose trial began in September, faces unrelated charges of concealing Livedoor’s losses and inflating its stock price. He has also pleaded not guilty and has vowed to battle the charges.Japanese public opinion appears split as to whether Mr. Murakami and Mr. Horie were crooks who bilked investors or challengers who got swatted by the establishment. Some commentators have suggested that the two men erred by aiming at Nippon Broadcasting, a member of the Fujisankei Communications Group, one of Japan’s largest and most powerful media conglomerates.Their arrests provoked concerns of a conservative backlash, and “winner bashing” by those in Japan who felt American-style market changes threatened their nation’s traditionally egalitarian society. Others said the two men had pushed the rules too far, and made too many enemies along the way.For a time this summer, it looked as if the Murakami case might also threaten one of Japan’s most respected economic leaders, Toshihiko Fukui, governor of the Bank of Japan. Revelations that Mr. Fukui had profited from investments in Mr. Murakami’s fund drew outrage from many Japanese, who have seen their own bank deposits languish under the near-zero interest rates imposed by the central bank. Mr. Fukui, however, survived the furor.'"
"'06-12-01,'0','One less-wealthy team, the Tampa Bay Devil Rays, hoped to enter the import business when it paid $4.5 million to the Swallows for the privilege of speaking to Akinori Iwamura, a third baseman.Suzuki, Matsuzaka and the rest can thank Irabu for all this. In late 1997, the Padres signed a working agreement with the Chiba Lotte Marines, which included the exclusive right to sign Irabu. But Irabu, and his agent, did not like this form of indentured servitude, and he said he would not sign with the Padres. No, he said, he only wanted the Yankees.“His owner said, ‘You’re going to San Diego,’ and he said, ‘No, I don’t want to, I want to stay here,’ ” said Gene Orza, the chief operating officer of the Major League Baseball Players Association. “His owner said, ‘You’re going there.’ He had nowhere to go and we said that was wrong.”The union argued that a working agreement that gave Irabu no freedom was absurd. Orza likened it to “trafficking in human flesh.” But baseball’s executive council ruled that the Padres held Irabu’s rights, which set off a two-month period in which San Diego dickered with several teams. But the Padres granted Irabu’s wish to be traded to the Yankees, who signed him for $12.8 million over four years, an investment that was among Steinbrenner’s worst.The union lost the Irabu battle, but the league ultimately banned working agreements that gave major league teams the exclusive rights to players. Commissioner Bud Selig and Hiromori Kawashima, his Japanese counterpart, signed the deal that ushered in posting in December 1998.“We wanted to assure a fair and open process for teams to get access to players,” said Rob Manfred, an executive vice president of Major League Baseball.One link from Irabu to Matsuzaka is Larry Lucchino, who was the president of the Padres and now holds the same position in Boston.Lucchino was returning from Japan yesterday and was unavailable for comment. But he might have been seeking Japanese sponsors to help finance the $51.1 million fee, which, as part of the Red Sox’ player costs, will not be subject to baseball’s luxury tax.A natural question to ask is why the posting system is not part of the relations between M.L.B. and, say, the Dominican Republic, where so many stars come from. The most glaring reason is that the Japanese players coming to North America have many years of experience, and “the Dominican players you want are recruited when they’re 16 or 17,” Orza said.Players that young can be signed cheaply before they are worth as much as Alfonso Soriano, who last month signed an eight-year, $136 million deal with the Chicago Cubs.If the posting system is an example of freer baseball trade, it is far behind the example of soccer, where transfer fees that routinely send players around the world have been common for decades. But in one significant way, soccer’s system is different because players still under contract by the selling team receive a small percentage of the fees from their buyers.In 2003, Manchester United sent David Beckham to Real Madrid for $41 million. Andriy Shevchenko, the Ukrainian striker, has quite a résumé: He was sent by Dynamo Kiev to A.C. Milan in 2000 for $25 million, and in May, went to Chelsea for $55 million. Shevchenko, then, has been worth more in fees than Matsuzaka and Igawa combined.'"

There is no immediate threat to our homeland at this time.”The site called for attackers to use viruses that could penetrate Internet sites and destroy data stored there.The alert was issued by the United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team, a partnership between private officials and the Homeland Security Department that warns Internet sites against virus outbreaks and other Internet attacks.'"
"'06-12-01,'0','WASHINGTON, Nov. 30 (AP) —Without notifying the public, federal agents for the past four years have assigned millions of international travelers, including Americans, computer-generated scores rating the risk they pose of being terrorists or criminals.The travelers are not allowed to see or directly challenge the risk assessments, which the government plans to hold for 40 years.The scores are assigned to people entering and leaving the United States after computers assess their travel records, including where they are from, how they paid for tickets, their motor vehicle records, past one-way travel, seating preference and what kind of meal they ordered.The existence of the program, the Automated Targeting System, was quietly disclosed earlier in November when the government published details about it in the Federal Register. Privacy and civil liberties lawyers, Congressional aides and law enforcement officers said they had thought the system applied only to cargo.The notice, by the Department of Homeland Security, called the program “one of the most advanced targeting systems in the world.” The department said the nation’s ability to spot criminals and other security threats “would be critically impaired without access to this data.”'"
"'06-12-01,'0','PC makers, software developers and others who rely on Microsoft’s Windows technology were disappointed by the delay past the holiday season in the consumer market, and their sales will most likely suffer this year.Yet the next Windows and Office cycle of buying is now on the horizon, and they are positioning themselves for advantage. Dell, for example, has stumbled over the last year. But it is strongest in the corporate market and it hopes to benefit from helping business customers make the transition to Windows Vista and Office 2007 relatively quickly and inexpensively. “This should work to Dell’s advantage,” said Brad Anderson, a Dell senior vice president.In its new products, Microsoft is acknowledging the importance customers place on Internet-based software — a technology direction symbolized by Google, which in addition to search is also offering other services, including Web-based document processing.The new wave of Microsoft offerings has been designed to find, view and link to blogs on the Internet, for example, and to use that technology with Microsoft products. “We want to bring those innovations safely inside the corporation,” Mr. Ballmer said.Microsoft also released new versions of two server products, Exchange Server 2007 and Office SharePoint Server 2007, which corporations have also been testing. The big gains for corporate customers, according to Mr. Ballmer, will come from using the new desktop and server software together. “It’s a Microsoft family of products,” he said. “And there’s all this innovation that’s coming behind the flagship products.”Exchange is the server program behind Outlook, Microsoft’s desktop e-mail and communications software, which is part of the Office suite of products. SharePoint is a collaboration tool, which allows people to work together and jointly modify reports, project plans and other documents online.SharePoint is similar to Web software for collaboration, like wikis, which are gaining in popularity inside companies. Eyeing the potential, Google recently bought a wiki start-up company called Jotspot.SharePoint is a collaboration tool, but one that is tied to the Office suite of productivity programs like Word, Excel, PowerPoint and Outlook, which are familiar to hundreds of millions of workers.SharePoint, analysts say, is doing well within companies, which want to enhance collaboration and productivity, but may be reluctant to rely on a start-up or free software for technology.“That’s a big lock-in factor and it helps Microsoft, at least for the next few years,” said Michael Silver, an analyst at Gartner, a research firm.While many companies are experimenting with Web-based software and free versions of office-oriented programs, they do not yet represent a real threat to Microsoft’s industry-dominant Windows and Office products, analysts say, at least not for another few years.“This is a better Windows and a better Office, and there is no feasible alternative for most companies,” said Jim Murphy, an analyst for AMR Research, a technology consulting firm.The testers of the new Microsoft products included the Scripps Research Institute in San Diego, where the cancer research group is using Vista, Office and SharePoint to show 3-D images of protein molecules on the surface of cancer cells, let scientists worldwide look at them and share written research. The specialized application was built in two weeks.“That simplicity is essential, and revolutionary, to help speed the pace of innovation in the kind of work we do,” said Dr. Peter Kuhn, a cell biologist at the institute.Michael Wolf, chief executive of MTV Networks, said the new Microsoft products made it easier and faster for teams of writers in far-flung locations to make changes quickly on scripts for television programs, all working from their favored Office program. “Our people are addicted to Outlook,” Mr. Wolf said.Shaygan Kheradpir, the chief information officer of Verizon, said the BitLocker feature in Vista, which allows for automatic data encryption, will ease his worries when company laptops are lost or stolen. “It’s a quantum jump in security and privacy,” he said.Microsoft has long said that its toughest competitor in the personal computer operating system market is previous versions of its own Windows software. And corporations tend to move gradually to new operating systems, waiting a year or two after a new Windows version is released, as they test their internal software applications and write new ones tailored for the new Windows.But “for most companies, it’s not a question of if, but when,” Mr. Murphy of AMR Research said.'"
"'06-12-01,'0','All of it supported Houshmandzadeh’s point: Right now, Cincinnati (7-5) may be the better team.After the Ravens won, 26-20, Nov. 5, he insisted that everyone knew the Bengals were better. He repeated it again this week, getting a rise out of some of the Ravens. Safety Ed Reed suggested that Houshmandzadeh should shut up.The Ravens were in no position to argue after Houshmandzadeh caught 10 passes for a season-high 106 yards, including the trick-play touchdown that made the score 13-0 early in the second half and allowed the defense to dig in on a rainy night.“I thought we played great in every area tonight,” Palmer said. “They didn’t do a whole lot different. We just played better.”So, did the victory prove that Cincinnati is better?“In a sense,” said Bengals receiver Chad Johnson, who had eight catches for 91 yards. “We’re 1-1. We’ll see who’s the better team if we have to face them again in the playoffs.”Palmer had a solid showing against a defense that led the league in interceptions, ranked second in sacks and was third in points allowed. The Ravens rarely got to Palmer, who was on the mark on a rainy night — 21 of 32 for 234 yards. .“It’s a lost opportunity,” Ravens tight end Todd Heap said. “Give them some credit. A lot of things went their way tonight. We just never got in the groove.”GENERAL MANAGER BACKS CRENNEL Cleveland General Manager Phil Savage strongly backed Coach Romeo Crennel yesterday, temporarily snuffing speculation that the Browns were on the verge of another coaching change.“Romeo has the total support of Randy Lerner and myself,” Savage said, referring to the team’s owner. “He has the respect of the team. We believe in him.”Crennel, who is 9-18 in two seasons with Cleveland, has come under scrutiny for the Browns’ 3-8 record and a perceived lack of player discipline.During a 30-0 loss to the Cincinnati Bengals on Sunday, wide receiver Braylon Edwards argued with teammates — a spectacle that led many to think Crennel had lost control of his team.VIKINGS’ WILLIAMS DOWNGRADED Minnesota Vikings defensive tackle Pat Williams was downgraded to doubtful from questionable for the game Sunday at Chicago because of a right knee injury.Williams has been bothered by the injury for much of the season and has been listed on the injury report as questionable for the last few weeks. He has yet to miss a game and is one of the biggest reasons the Vikings (5-6) rank No. 1 in the league in rush defense.CULPEPPER HAS KNEE SURGERY Miami Dolphins quarterback Daunte Culpepper had arthroscopic knee surgery yesterday to remove a piece of cartilage that has hampered his recovery from reconstructive surgery a year ago.The problem was discovered when Culpepper was examined Wednesday by James Andrews in Birmingham, Ala.Culpepper will remain on the Dolphins’ active roster, at least for now, so he could play again this season.DEL RIO NOT INTERESTED IN ALABAMA Jacksonville Jaguars Coach Jack Del Rio responded to rumors and radio reports mentioning him as a candidate for Alabama’s coaching job, saying he was not interested.“Let me put it to bed,” Del Rio, who is in his fourth season with the Jaguars, said Wednesday.'"
"'06-12-01,'0','Still, several pockets of strong growth remained. Five Western states — Idaho, Utah, Oregon, Arizona and Washington — had the biggest price increases, ranging from 1 percent to 4.7 percent. And on the Gulf Coast, a shortage of housing and the slow pace of rebuilding sent home prices soaring in markets that were affected by Hurricane Katrina. Prices rose 15.8 percent from a year earlier in New Orleans, 23.3 percent in Gulfport-Biloxi, Miss., and 17.5 percent in Mobile, Ala.Unlike data collected by the National Association of Realtors, which have shown declines in the median price of homes sold in the last three months, the federal housing office’s index is still rising. That difference is a result of the way the government compiles its index, housing specialists say. It measures repeat sales of the same houses over time, while the Realtors report median prices of houses sold in a period.If a large number of modest homes are sold in a given month relative to a year earlier, the Realtors data will indicate that prices have fallen, even if the price on any specific property has not changed appreciably. Also, the government index does not include condominiums, and condo sales and prices have fallen far faster than those of single-family homes.Taken together, the two data series suggest that moderately priced single-family homes are doing better than more expensive properties, said S. Lawrence Yun, a senior economist at the Realtors association.Mr. Lawler said an adjustment in home prices should come as no surprise given that prices rose 55 percent nationally in the last five years, with some hotter markets posting even bigger gains. He noted that, adjusting for inflation, prices fell in the early 1980s and the early 1990s after periods of strong gains. What is surprising about the recent flattening in prices, however, is that it has not been prompted by economic weakness and job losses, as was the case in those previous periods.“This market has been unusual over the past few years because we had a recession” earlier in the decade, Mr. Lawler said, “and the market didn’t weaken, and now the housing market is weakening and we don’t have a recession.”The weakness in housing appears to be more muted and gradual than many had predicted. The recent decline in long-term interest has provided critical support to the housing market, Mr. Lawler said. Nationally, the average 30-year fixed mortgage carried an interest rate of 6.14 percent this week, down from 6.76 percent in July and roughly where it was in January, according to Freddie Mac.National and local data on home prices may not reflect reality as lived by people trying to buy or sell homes, said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Economy.com. Housing reports are based on transactions, and because many sellers are reluctant to cut prices and buyers are waiting for prices to fall further, the number of homes being sold has fallen significantly.'"
"'06-12-01,'0','Times have changed, as the buzz at Thursday’s Davis Cup draw in the Olympic Stadium made clear. The pivotal moments were tennis’s re-entering the Olympics in 1988 and Yeltsin’s discovering a passion for the game during his tenure as Russia’s first president from 1991 to 1999. “At that stage, the middle level of tennis was not bad, but when Yeltsin came out in a tennis outfit on court, at that moment the whole thing took a leap,” Tarpishchev said. “The mass media, the TV, everything came in, and the good thing was that it came at a time when we had already prepared the ground before.”Now comes the reaping. You can make a strong argument that Russia, with its combined strength in the men’s and women’s game, is the leading tennis nation in the world. Traditional powers Australia and the United States are reeling and slumping. Belgium has great women’s players but no great men. Spain has terrific men but no terrific women. Switzerland has Roger Federer, of course, and a solid supporting cast in Martina Hingis, Patty Schnyder and Stanislas Wawrinka, but cannot match the Russians’ depth.Maria Sharapova, Anastasia Myskina and Svetlana Kuznetsova have won women’s Grand Slam singles titles in the past three years. Davydenko, a whippet of a counterpuncher, is ranked third in the world and was a United States Open semifinalist this year. Safin won the 2000 United States Open and the 2005 Australian Open, but he has not won any tournament since because of a lingering knee injury and his mercurial temperament.But after dropping to 104th in the world rankings in August, he has worked his way back to No. 25 and is wearing a lean and hungry look this week, shouting and hurling rackets in practice. He was the dominant force when Russia won its first Davis Cup, in Paris in 2002. He swept his two singles matches against the French before Mikhail Youzhny finished off the victory with an improbable rally from two sets down against Paul-Henri Mathieu in the fifth match.Safin would love to salvage this season by leading Russia to its first Davis Cup title on home ground. He will play one of Friday’s singles matches, facing Argentina’s No. 1 player, David Nalbandian. In the opening match, Davydenko will face Juan Ignacio Chela, who was picked by the Argentine captain, Alberto Mancini, largely because he has a 5-0 career edge over Davydenko.Safin described his past year as one filled with injury and bad luck. “A lot of things went the wrong way,” he said. “So the only thing that really can make this year worth it is I think the Davis Cup.”The counterpoint to Safin’s experience is Dmitry Tursunov, the curly-topped, part-time blogger who moved to California at 12 and is still based there. “I didn’t even watch the final in 2002,” Tursunov said. “I was in the States. You kind of hope something like this happens when you are growing up. You always want it. But I definitely didn’t think in 2006 I would be in the finals.”Tursunov, who said he once unsuccessfully applied for an American green card, is typical of his generation in that he has honed his game abroad but still represents Russia. There has been some talent drain. Anna Smashnova left for Israel, but that was the exception. Safin and Kuznetsova trained in Spain as teenagers. Davydenko based himself in Germany. Sharapova has been based in the United States since she was 9.Tarpishchev says the early experiences are the ones that create the emotional ties, and though he is one of those working hard to create more training options and academies in Russia, he said that the system of studying abroad had had some advantages.“If a player is good and stays here after 14, the next kid coming up doesn’t have room to play and develop, so I have urged them to go,” he said. “That way, we get the world to work for us.”'"
"'06-12-01,'0','Mr. Maliki does not now have full operational control of the military, and he is menaced by numerous armed militias and insurgent cells operating with virtual impunity.One approach expected to be put forward by the Iraq Study Group would be that, as the size of the American combat force is reduced, the Pentagon would send thousands of additional trainers to assist in the building of Iraqi Army and police forces.Mr. Maliki seemed to embrace that idea today, saying that his government would be fully ready to take command by June 2007. Democrats in Congress have been demanding that the United States begin removing its troops within the next four to six months and give control of Iraq to the Iraqis.“I can say that Iraqi forces will be ready, fully ready to receive this command and to command its own forces, and I can tell you that by next June our forces will be ready,” Mr. Maliki told ABC News after meeting President Bush in Jordan.He said that the president had assured him that he was not preparing to remove American forces any time soon and that he would provide additional training and support for the Iraqi military. He said any decision on American troop withdrawals was up to the Bush administration.For his part, Mr. Bush insisted that American troops would stay in Iraq unless the government asks them to leave. “We’re going to stay in Iraq to get the job done as long as the government wants us there,” he said.Stephen J. Hadley, the White House national security adviser, said that the United States was working diligently to improve the capability of the Maliki government to maintain some semblance of order in Iraq and to assume control of its own armed forces. He refused, however, to give any estimate of how long the task would take.“Building a military, a successful and high-quality military, is something that, obviously, takes some time,” Mr. Hadley said in a briefing for reporters aboard Air Force One returning to Washington from Jordan. “We’ve been at it for a while. There is going to be more work to do. But you can get units to the point that they can take increasing responsibility for security. That’s what we’ve been doing, that’s what we’ll continue to do.”He said that the United States and Iraq were speeding up the schedule under which Iraqi forces come under Iraqi, and not American, command.Mr. Hadley added that the Iraqis were aware both of the security problems they face and the diminishing American public support for the military mission there.“There is a real sense of urgency, but there is not a sense of panic,” Mr. Hadley said. “And that is a good thing for a government that’s under — has a lot of challenges before it.”The meeting of Mr. Bush and Mr. Maliki, a two-hour session in Amman, Jordan, took place against a backdrop of rising sectarian violence in Iraq and increasing tensions between the two leaders.Earlier this week, news reports brought to a light a classified memorandum by Mr. Hadley in which he raised doubts about Mr. Maliki’s leadership. And on Wednesday evening, Mr. Maliki took the unusual step of backing out of a planned three-way meeting with the president that would include the Jordanian leader, King Abdullah II.But in their news conference, the two men appeared to be on the same page.During his appearance with Mr. Maliki, President Bush offered to speed up the transfer of command of Iraqi forces to the Iraqi government. Mr. Maliki is under pressure at home to demonstrate more independence from the United States, but Americans, as well as Sunni Arab politicians in Iraq, have been concerned that the Iraqi troops would be used by the Shiite government against the Sunni populace.The president also rejected the idea of partitioning Iraq to create buffers between the country’s main sectarian groups, an idea that Mr. Maliki has publicly opposed though some other Shiite leaders have backed it.During his statement, Mr. Maliki issued a pointed message to its neighbors, Syria and Iran, whom the United States has accused of supporting militant groups within Iraq, not to interfere with Iraqi affairs.“Iraq is for Iraqis,” Mr. Maliki said.The much-publicized meeting — a breakfast attended by aides including Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and General George W. Casey, the top American commander in Iraq, followed by a 45 minute one-on-one session — was came as both leaders face intense pressure to bring the bloody sectarian violence in Iraq under control.At the news conference afterward, Mr. Bush stood by Mr. Maliki’s side and showered him with praise, saying, “He’s the right guy for Iraq.”In Washington today, Senator Carl Levin, the Michigan Democrat who will become chairman of the Armed Services Committee in January, welcomed the reported recommendations of the Iraq Study Group, saying they were similar to what he and other Democrats have been proposing for months.“It sends a message to the Iraqis that our presence there is not open-ended and that we are going to pull back, redeploy in a reasonable amount of time,” Senator Levin said in an interview. “They share our premise that the Iraqis have got to feel a sense of urgency if they are going to reach a political settlement.”He said that the panel’s recommendations, if they are adopted even in part by the White House, mark an “important shift” in the debate on Iraq policy.Senator John Cornyn, a Republican member of the Armed Services Committee from Texas, said that he believed it would be necessary to send tens of thousands of additional troops to Iraq in the short term in order to stabilize Baghdad and control the sectarian militias that are killing each other and Americans.He said he was gratified to hear Mr. Maliki’s claim that his forces would be adequate to the task by the middle of next year, but said he did not think he was being realistic.“I would love to believe it,” Mr. Cornyn said in a telephone interview from Texas. “Perhaps it’s useful for him to set goals for his own security forces. But it’s pretty clear to me that, at least from a logistical standpoint, Iraqi troops will need to receive support from the United States for quite a long time.”'"

"'06-12-02,'0','Mr. Cuomo, however, said he would announce a wide-ranging set of ethics rules for the office of attorney general, proposals for the Legislature and his own voluntary campaign finance guidelines. But he said he would not offer those rules and proposals until he is sworn in.“I applaud Elliot’s reforms, and I’m going to have specific proposals in the same spirit,” Mr. Cuomo said. “I’m going to have contribution guidelines for myself, which I will announce in January.”In addition to the contribution limits, Mr. Spitzer laid down several new ethics rules for members of his incoming administration.For example, he pledged that neither he nor his aides would hold fund-raising events in Albany during the legislative session.Mr. Cuomo said that the attorney general’s office is “a little different.” He added that his transition office spent the last few weeks putting together regulations and voluntary changes “that I want to make as well as legislative changes.”He added, “I’m going to put forth a comprehensive package right after I get sworn in.”During the campaign, Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, made ethics reform in Albany a hallmark of his speeches to audiences in his race against the Republican candidate, Jeanine F. Pirro, the former Westchester Country district attorney.But at the same time, the race for attorney general drew more money than usual, with a small number of devoted big-dollar donors helping to set a record for fund-raising in the race.Mr. Cuomo has proposed banning gifts from lobbyists to lawmakers and prohibiting legislators from accepting honorariums for speeches. He has also said he would push for forbidding elected officials and other state executives to lobby the government for three years after leaving office.Many of these proposals would require legislation by the State Assembly and the Senate, something that many legislators consider would be an uphill battle.He also said he would call for changing the state’s campaign finance laws.Civic groups have long complained that New York State’s laws are too lenient, especially when compared with the much stronger laws in New York City and at the federal level. They say contribution limits are high and effectively are often even higher because of loopholes.'"
"'06-12-02,'0','In September, Mr. Reyes blasted the White House’s justifications for the National Security Agency wiretapping program.“I take very seriously our obligation to provide the president with the tools that he needs to provide for national security,” he said, “but I also reject the notion that the authorization for use of military force allows the president to ignore the Fourth Amendment and conduct warrantless surveillance on American citizens.”The choice of an intelligence committee chairman had emerged as the second controversial decision in the early leadership tenure of Mrs. Pelosi. Committee chairmanships are normally decided by seniority, but it is Mrs. Pelosi’s prerogative to choose someone else.Last month, the Democratic caucus soundly rejected Mrs. Pelosi’s choice for majority leader, electing Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland over John P. Murtha of Pennsylvania. Then, the signal by Mrs. Pelosi that she intended to bypass Ms. Harman for the intelligence post stirred dissent among moderate Democrats, particularly members of the conservative Blue Dog Coalition, who mounted a campaign for Ms. Harman.Ms. Harman made the case publicly that the centrist course she had taken on national security issues would be crucial to the Democrats maintaining a majority in Congress. Alcee L. Hastings, a liberal Florida congressman who was one of Ms. Harman’s competitors for the position, had also been marshaling support to his side, and had the backing of the powerful Congressional Black Caucus.But Mr. Hastings, who was impeached and removed from a federal judgeship in 1989 because of a bribery scandal, was opposed by conservative Democrats and ultimately deemed by Mrs. Pelosi to be too controversial for the position.Mrs. Pelosi called Ms. Harman on Friday morning to deliver the news, and the two Californians spoke for about 10 minutes, according to people familiar with both sides of the conversation. Mrs. Pelosi thanked Ms. Harman for her “service and intellectual contribution.”Ms. Harman, though, beat Mrs. Pelosi to the punch in announcing the news. In a break of political protocol, she sent out a statement congratulating Mr. Reyes before Mrs. Pelosi’s office had even made the appointment official. In a statement on Friday, Ms. Harman gave her “full and enthusiastic support” for Mr. Reyes and pledged to “stay actively involved in security matters.”Representative Lincoln Davis, Democrat of Tennessee, was one of the Blue Dog Democrats who signed a letter to Mrs. Pelosi last month urging her to select Ms. Harman. It was Ms. Harman’s instruction on intelligence matters, he said, that helped several Democrats win election and defuse the charge that Democrats are soft on national security.“Obviously, some of us would have been happier with Jane Harman. She has a grasp of national intelligence issues,” Mr. Davis said in a telephone interview on Friday from his district in Middle Tennessee.“I really don’t know what the problem is,” he added. “They are both from California, you know.”But Mr. Davis also said that Mr. Reyes was an excellent compromise and he predicted the storm would quickly blow over inside the Democratic caucus.Representative Anna G. Eshoo, a California Democrat who sits on the Intelligence Committee and is close to Mrs. Pelosi, said that Mr. Reyes’s low profile would serve him well in the new job.“He doesn’t shoot from the lip. He’s not a showboat,” Ms. Eshoo said in a telephone interview Friday from California. “He doesn’t alienate people when he offers his views. He’s firm, yet he’s open-minded.”Born and raised in Canutillo, Tex., a town on the outskirts of El Paso, Mr. Reyes was drafted into the army and spent 13 months in Vietnam as a helicopter crew chief. He lost hearing in his right ear when an explosion rocked his bunker there. Shortly after returning from Vietnam he began what would become a 26-year career in the Border Patrol.After retiring from the Border Patrol in 1995, he was elected to Congress the next year and has served on the Intelligence Committee since 2001. He will become the seventh Hispanic representative to lead a full House committee.But he will inherit a committee that in recent years has become one of Congress’s most dysfunctional and partisan panels.The past two months have been particularly rancorous, beginning in October when Ms. Harman released the findings of a committee investigation over the objection of the panel’s chairman, Representative Peter Hoekstra, Republican of Michigan.Soon afterward, Mr. Hoekstra suspended the access of a Democratic staff member to classified material on the suspicion that he was the source of a leaked National Intelligence Estimate on global terrorism.The staff member, Larry Hanauer, was later cleared of wrongdoing.'"
"'06-12-02,'0','Bank of America’s chief financial officer, Alvaro G. de Molina, said yesterday that he would step down in January to look for other opportunities. His exit is a surprise given that the bank has had a string of successes of late.Mr. Molina, who took on the top financial post just 15 months ago, said he was leaving for a job where he could have a bigger role or build a business, He will, however, remain at Bank of America until March in a transitional position.“Nothing at Bank of America needs fixing,” he said in a brief interview late yesterday afternoon. “I am looking for something that will be more impactful.”Joe Price, a longtime risk management executive, will become the new chief financial officer.The announcement comes as Bank of America stock price has soared over the last year. This week, it overtook Citigroup as the country’s biggest bank by market value.Mr. de Molina succeeded Mark Oken, who had been criticized for failing to communicate with Wall Street analysts. Mr. de Molina helped shore up Bank of America’s credibility with the Street but also was seen to be playing a major role behind the scenes.'"
"'06-12-02,'0','Nalbandian’s victory guaranteed that this final would not be decided until the reverse singles on Sunday. Nalbandian, however, is scheduled to play next in the doubles Saturday, teaming with Agustin Calleri against the Russian team of Dmitry Tursunov and Mikhail Youzhny.The Davis Cup, which Argentina has chased without success since 1921, is still no sure thing, but it is now in closer range.“I think if someone had asked me whether I would sign up for 1-1 after the opening day, with David winning in three sets, I would have signed without a problem,” said Argentina’s captain, Alberto Mancini. He added, “I think this is a very positive result for us, and it puts us in good position.”Safin is not the same player who was once ranked No. 1 and who held off Roger Federer in the semifinals before winning the 2005 Australian Open. But Safin, now ranked 26th, is still a big-match threat, one who had every intention of winning on opening day in his home city.Instead, it went wrong from the start. He lost his big serve after a marathon opening game, in which he had four aces but finished with a double fault. Nalbandian, sharp and focused from the opening point, never relinquished the advantage. That left Safin to fume and even exchange sharp words with his longtime captain, Shamil Tarpishchev, on a changeover.“If he took offense, I would like to apologize, because I really respect him a lot,” Safin said. “But he should also understand me, because I was running out there but I was not able to do anything.”Nalbandian had lost six of his eight meetings against Safin, but he had won their most recent match in Madrid.In this match, he faced only one break point against Safin, and he saved it with aplomb.“For me it’s all about motivation,” Nalbandian said. “When I’m motivated, everything seems possible.”Trying to give Argentina its first Davis Cup title certainly seems inspirational. It was enough to get the former soccer star Diego Maradona and more than 100 other Argentines to make the long journey from Buenos Aires. They arrived Thursday. Maradona has been a regular supporter of Nalbandian and the Argentine team this year, attending its first-round matches against Sweden and the semifinal against Australia. He caused a hardly atypical stir when he shouted insults at the Swedish player Robin Soderling.But his behavior was more exemplary Friday. “I could hear him,” Nalbandian said. “And it was incredible to have this kind of support for the team.”The capacity crowd of 10,900 was still overwhelmingly Russian, and Davydenko gave them much more reason to cheer. Working overtime has worked well enough for Davydenko so far, carrying him from humble beginnings to wealth (if not fame) and the No. 3 ranking. So it was no surprise to see him on the court again, only six days after his wedding.With his first Davis Cup final at hand, his honeymoon could wait, and the result was a 1-0 lead. Davydenko handled Chela, 6-1, 6-2, 5-7, 6-4.“He just showed some incredible tennis, a very high level of tennis today, plus we must take into account that I never played Davydenko on this specific surface,” Chela said. “That was also a factor.”Chela had won all five of their previous meetings. Three had been on clay; the other two on outdoor hardcourts. Their most recent match was this year in the first round in Cincinnati. But on this medium-speed indoor court, Chela could not quite keep pace, even though Davydenko’s tennis was only phenomenal in spurts.Tarpishchev was soon exchanging congratulatory kisses and pats on the shoulders with Davydenko and the rest of the Russian team.“The thing is, I never thought about the five losses against Chela; the important thing for me was to never think about my opponent but rather focus on my game,” Davydenko said. “I was nervous at the beginning, but unexpectedly I won easily the first two sets. Then I got tired, got nervous. How can you not be nervous when you’re playing at home with the support of the home crowd?”'"
"'06-12-02,'0','LOS ANGELES, Dec. 1 — The Walt Disney Company announced on Friday that it would cut about 160 of the 800 jobs at its Disney animation unit, suggesting that it would make fewer movies as it focuses on improving quality.The announcement signaled the latest change in the division under John A. Lasseter and Edwin E. Catmull, the two executives from Pixar who took over after Disney’s $7.4 billion acquisition of Pixar Animation Studios. The employment of the two Pixar executives was part of the acquisition.In the past, Disney sought to make at least one animated film a year, but the results have been mixed. Disney is a newer entrant into the computer-animated genre, which others, like Pixar, dominate. This year Disney said it would push back the release of its computer-animated film “Meet the Robinsons,” which was scheduled to be released this month. It will come out next spring instead.According to a person involved, Mr. Lasseter, who oversees Disney animation’s creative efforts, reviewed the film and suggested revisions.“Walt Disney Animation has determined that each film will dictate its own appropriate production schedule,” the company said in a statement about cutting 20 percent of the animation studio’s jobs. “The result of this necessitated a reduction in staff.”By contrast, Pixar, has typically made a film every 18 months and each film has been a hit, including “Toy Story,” “Finding Nemo” and “The Incredibles.” While the Disney and Pixar animation units are part of the same studio, they remain separate entities.

In a statement, the company said the plane would be financed primarily from Airbus cash flows and from partners, but provided few details.The chief executive of Airbus and a co-chief executive of EADS, Louis Gallois, said: “The decision follows a thorough review of all the resources available to ensure a smooth development of the family backed by a very sound program planning.”Financing had been a major sticking point in winning approval from the company’s core shareholders. The group’s biggest private shareholders — the German automaker DaimlerChrysler and the French conglomerate Lagardère — have been pushing to issue bonds to raise money for the plane, people briefed on the negotiations said last week. But the French government had proposed an issue of new EADS shares that it would have purchased, a move that would have increased the French state’s 15 percent stake at the expense of other core shareholders.EADS said in a statement on Friday that it expected to spread the development costs of the program over the years 2007 to 2014 with the bulk of spending occurring from 2010 to 2013.Airbus has promoted the A350 XWB — as in extra wide body — as the linchpin of its recovery. The company has suffered costly setbacks to its A380 superjumbo project, and said last month that the project would be delayed two years.The A350, which will carry 250 to 375 passengers, is intended to challenge Boeing’s 787 and 777, and is scheduled to enter service in 2013, the company said.'"
"'06-12-02,'0','The results capped a bleak few days for Ford in which it revealed plans to mortgage its factories and other assets to raise $18 billion in cash, then projected that in the next year it would spend much of that in payments to the 40 percent of its hourly workers who are taking company buyouts and leaving their jobs.“It was disappointing,” Ford’s chief sales analyst, George Pipas, said on a conference call with reporters and Wall Street analysts. “We missed our own internal sales targets for the month.”G.M. reported a 6 percent sales increase in November, and the Chrysler Group ended a long streak of declines and placed No. 3 for the first time since March by posting a gain of 3 percent. Both sold fewer passenger cars but more trucks than a year ago, while Ford’s sales declined in both categories.Ford and G.M. said they would reduce production in the first quarter of 2007 — Ford by 14.4 percent and G.M. by 9 percent — to help clear inventories and to prepare for planned cuts in sales to rental car agencies. Ford said it expected to produce 620,000 vehicles in the fourth quarter. That is 15,000 below prior estimates, which already reflected a 20 percent cut because of a temporary halt in building the Freestar minivan.Ford attributed much of its sales decline in November to fewer rental agency sales, which are significantly less profitable than transactions at dealerships. In October, Ford stopped building the Taurus, a midsize sedan that was sold exclusively as a rental car in its final years.Ford’s turnaround plan calls for more emphasis on retail sales in a bid to regain profitability even at the expense of some market share. The company has said that it expects its market share to stabilize at a level of 14 to 15 percent.“We’d like to sell as much as the next person or more,” Mr. Pipas said. “We’re much more interested in returning our business to profitability.”Although Toyota passed Ford in November, analysts expect Ford to do better through the winter, when sales of the sport utility vehicles that make up much of its lineup tend to be higher. But Ford’s plan to close plants and reduce its production capacity means it cannot fend off Toyota for long.“By the time we get to July of next year, Toyota will permanently replace Ford as the No. 2 automaker,” said Jesse Toprak, director of industry analysis at Edmunds.com, a Web site that gives consumers advice about buying cars. “By that time, Ford will never be able to catch up with Toyota.”Ford is hoping for good news in December, when its long-awaited crossover vehicle, the Edge, goes on sale. The Edge was to reach dealerships in November but was delayed while Ford addressed supply problems.But Ford could face tougher competition than it has expected in the lucrative pickup truck segment, which its F-Series has long dominated. Sales of the F-Series fell 16 percent in November, while G.M.’s redesigned Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra pickups increased 21 percent. Toyota will add considerable pressure in early 2007 with a new version of its Tundra pickup.All three Detroit automakers managed to shrink their inventories of unsold vehicles somewhat in November, but their dealership lots are still far more crowded than those of their Asian competitors.Chrysler, which lost $1.5 billion in the third quarter because of slumping sales, had more than 500,000 unsold vehicles at the end of November: 499,000 in what it calls dealer inventory and thousands more that were built without an order from a specific dealer.Chrysler’s vice president for sales, Steven J. Landry, would not say how many cars were in the order bank — there were nearly 100,000 earlier this year — but he said “we are on track” to reach zero by year’s end.But reducing inventory has come at a steep cost. In November, Chrysler spent $4,224 a vehicle on incentives, nearly double the national average, according to Edmunds.com. And the discounts have failed to persuade shoppers to buy 2006 models, which were replaced by new versions around September and typically are almost sold out this late in the year.About a third of the vehicles Chrysler has on hand are 2006 models, compared with 15 percent for Ford and 14 percent for G.M.G.M., whose market share rose to 24.6 percent because of a 16 percent increase in truck sales, said it was pleased with its performance. After losing $10.6 billion in 2005, G.M. has posted an operating profit for three consecutive quarters.“We feel very good about our product cadence, and we feel very good about our progress the last six months,” said G.M.’s chief sales analyst, Paul Ballew.Besides the cutback in rental sales, Ford said it hurt itself in November by starting its year-end marketing campaign later than competitors after focusing on unloading 2006 models since the summer.“We probably paid the price for that,” Mr. Pipas said.'"

"'06-12-02,'0','Verdi’s monumental and profound opera “Don Carlo” requires a clarion-voiced and tireless tenor for the demanding title role. The Metropolitan Opera has not been able to present a truly great Don Carlo since Plácido Domingo in the early 1980s.So there was great anticipation on Thursday night before the powerhouse South African tenor Johan Botha sang the role for the first time at the Met, when the company’s starkly realistic 1979 production by John Dexter returned to the repertory. As those who have seen Mr. Botha cannot easily forget, he is a barrel-bellied man and a stiff actor. Still, he has the vocal goods. Though he took time to warm up, he sang with burnished sound, ringing top notes and poignant phrasing. Yes, he was a tree trunk onstage. But he acted with his voice, conveying youthful impetuosity and yearning.Mr. Botha faced an additional problem, though. Verdi’s opera, based on a play by Schiller, is a story of romantic intrigue and power plays among the ruling families of Spain and France against the backdrop of the Inquisition. The drama continually pits Don Carlo, the Spanish crown prince, against his manipulative father, Philip II. And singing Philip for the first time at the Met was the astounding German bass René Pape, who so dominated the performance that Verdi’s “Don Carlo” might have been renamed “The Tragedy of King Philip.”In a move to end a horrific war between their countries, Elisabeth, the daughter of Henri II of France, has been given in marriage to Philip. Yet she and Don Carlo, who were initially betrothed, are deeply in love. Here, though, the Spanish king was the tall, charismatic and robust-voiced Mr. Pape. Who would not rather be married to this Philip?Mr. Pape was wrenching in the immensely sad aria when the emotionally shattered king, alone in his chamber, realizes that he has alienated his son, is unloved by his wife and is feared by his people. And in the scene that follows, the bass Samuel Ramey as the Grand Inquisitor, a fanatical cleric who intimidates the king into cracking down on all dissent, proved a chilling match for Mr. Pape’s beleaguered king. The veteran Mr. Ramey has a wobble in his sustained tones these days, but it actually enhanced his portrayal of this aged, blind and maniacal character.Elisabeth was a plum assignment for the admirable and underappreciated American soprano Patricia Racette. A lovely woman and an involving actress, she gave an honest, deeply expressive and temperamental portrayal. She does not have a particularly plush sound, and in going for intensity she sometimes pushed her voice, resulting in some hard-edged phrases. Still, there was great character in her singing.'"
"'06-12-02,'0','Alarmed by New York City’s status as a global center of film and video piracy, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg has embraced a proposal that would criminalize unauthorized recording in movie theaters.At first glance, the proposal, which is before the City Council, might seem unnecessary. A federal law signed by President Bush in April 2005 made recording a film with a video camera in a movie theater a felony, punishable by up to three years in prison for the first offense. And in Albany the Legislature is weighing bills, supported by Mr. Bloomberg, that would make recording a film inside a theater a crime statewide.Nonetheless, powerful industry groups are pushing New York City to adopt its own anti-recording statute, hoping that such a law would spur the Police Department to crack down on piracy and minimize the economic damage it does.“Piracy robs New York City of tax revenue, cheats trademark holders and undermines the creative community, which is a vital sector of our economy,” said John A. Feinblatt, the mayor’s criminal justice coordinator. “We have a responsibility to fight this crime at every level: city, state and federal.”In November 2004 a report by City Comptroller William C. Thompson Jr. estimated that the counterfeit trade in the city totaled $23 billion a year and cost the city more than $1 billion a year in lost taxes: $380 million in sales taxes, $360 million in personal income taxes and $290 million in business income taxes.'"

"'06-12-03,'0','The climate turned out to be as inhospitable as the inhabitants-dry and bitter cold. At times it was so difficult to farm that the men would join the railroad crews while their wives scavenged for buffalo bones to sell to fertilizer manufacturers. Most of those who stayed on the land turned to livestock since the fields rippled with yellow buffalo grass on which sheep and cows could graze. Farming there either broke men or hardened them, as Elias would be hardened, but being as opportunistic as his Disney forebears, he had no more interest in farming than his father had. He wanted escape.Father and son now set their sights on Florida. The winter of 1885-86 had been especially brutal in Ellis. Will Disney, Kepple's youngest son, remembered the snow drifting into ten-to-twelve-foot banks, forcing the settlers from the wagon trains heading west to camp in the schoolhouse for six weeks until the weather broke. The snow was so deep that the train tracks were cleared only when six engines were hitched to a dead locomotive with a snowplow and made run after run at the drifts, inching forward and backing up, gradually nudging through. Kepple, tired of the cruel Kansas weather, decided to join a neighbor family on a reconnaissance trip to Lake County, in the middle of Florida, where the neighbors had relatives. Elias went with him.For Elias, Florida held another inducement besides the promise of warm weather and new opportunities. The neighbor family they had accompanied, the Calls, had a sixteen-year-old daughter named Flora. The Calls, like the Disneys, were pioneers who nevertheless disdained the hardscrabble life. Their ancestors had arrived in America from England in 1636, settling first outside Boston and then moving to upstate New York. In 1825 Flora's grandfather, Eber Call, reportedly to escape hostile Indians and bone-chilling cold, left with his wife and three children for Huron County in Ohio, where he cleared several acres and farmed. But Eber Call, like Kepple Disney, had higher aspirations. Two of his daughters became teachers, and his son, Charles, was graduated from Oberlin College in 1847 with high honors. After heading to California to find gold and then drifting through the West for several years, Charles wound up outside Des Moines, Iowa, where he met Henrietta Gross, a German immigrant. They married on September 9, 1855, and returned to his father's house in Ohio. Charles became a teacher.Exactly why at the age of fifty-six he decided to leave Ohio in January 1879, after roughly twenty years there and ten children, is a mystery, though a daughter later claimed it was because he was fearful that one of his eight girls might marry into a neighbor family with eight sons, none of whom were sober enough for the devout teacher. Why he chose to become a farmer is equally mysterious, and why he chose Ellis, Kansas, is more mysterious still. The rough-hewn frontier town was nothing like the tranquil Ohio village he had left, and it had little to offer save for cheap land. But Ellis proved no more hospitable to the Calls than it had to the Disneys. Within a year the family had begun to scatter. Flora, scarcely in her teens, was sent to normal school in Ellsworth to be trained as a teacher, and apparently roomed with Albertha Disney, Elias's sister, though it is likely he had already taken notice of her since the families' farms were only two miles from each other.Within a few years the weather caught up to the Calls-probably the legendary storm of January 1886. In all likelihood it was the following autumn that they left for Florida by train with Elias and Kepple Disney as company. Kepple returned to Ellis shortly thereafter. Elias stayed on with the Calls. The area where they settled, in the middle of the state, was by one account ""howling wilderness"" at the time. Even so, after their Kansas experience the Calls found it ""beautiful"" and thought their new life there would be ""promising."" It was known generally as Pine Island for its piney woods on the wet, high rolling land and for the rivers that isolated it, but it was dotted with new outposts. Elias settled in Acron, where there were only seven families; the Calls settled in adjoining Kismet. Charles cleared some acreage to raise oranges and took up teaching again in neighboring Norristown, while Flora became the teacher in Acron her first year and Paisley her second. Meanwhile Elias delivered mail from a horse-drawn buckboard and courted Flora.Their marriage, at the Calls' home in Kismet on New Year's Day 1888, wedded the intrepid determination of the Disneys with the softer, more intellectual temper of the Calls-two strains of earthbound romanticism that would merge in their youngest son. The couple even looked the part, Elias's flinty gauntness contrasting with Flora's amiable roundness, as his age-he was nearly thirty at the time of the wedding-contrasted with the nineteen-year-old bride's youth. Marriage, however, didn't change his fortunes. He had bought an orange grove, but a freeze destroyed most of his crop, forcing him back into delivering the mail. In the meantime Charles Call had an accident while clearing some land of pines, never fully recovered, and died early in 1890. His death loosened the couple's bond to Florida. ""Elias was very much like his father; he couldn't be contented very long in any one place,"" Elias's cousin, Peter Cantelon, observed. The Disney wanderlust and the need to escape would send Elias back north-this time to a nine-room house in Chicago.He had been preceded to Chicago by someone who seemed just as blessed as Elias was cursed. Robert Disney, Elias's younger brother by two-and-a-half years, was viewed by the family as the successful one. He was big and handsome-tall, broad, and fleshy where Elias was short, slim, and wiry, and he had an expansive, voluble, glad-handing manner to match his appearance. The ""real dandy of the family,"" his nephew would say. But if Robert Disney looked the very picture of a man of means, the image obscured the fact that he was actually a schemer with talents for convincing and cajoling that Elias could never hope to match. Six months after Elias married Flora, Robert had married a wealthy Boston girl named Margaret Rogers and embarked on his career of speculation in real estate, oil, and even gold mines-anything he could squeeze for a profit. He had come to Chicago in 1889 in anticipation of the 1893 Columbian Exposition, which would celebrate the four-hundredth anniversary of Columbus's discovery of America, and had built a hotel there. Elias had also come for the promise of employment from the fair, but his dreams were humbler. Living in his brother's shadow, he was hoping for work not as a magnate but as a carpenter, a skill he had apparently acquired while laboring on the railroad in his knockabout days.The Disneys arrived in Chicago late in the spring of 1890, a few months after Charles Call's death, with their infant son, Herbert, and with Flora pregnant again. Elias rented a one-story frame cottage at 3515 South Vernon on the city's south side, an old mid-nineteenth-century farmhouse now isolated amid much more expensive residences; its chief recommendation was that it was only twenty blocks from the site of the exposition. Construction on the fair began early the next year, after Flora had given birth that December to a second son, Ray. The family enjoyed few extravagances. Elias earned only a dollar a day as a carpenter. But he was industrious and frugal, and by the fall he had saved enough to purchase a plot of land for $700 through his brother's real estate connections. By the next year he had applied for a building permit at 1249 Tripp Avenue* to construct a two-story wooden cottage for his family, which the following June would add another son, Roy O. Disney.Though it was set within the city, the area to which they moved the spring of 1893, in the northwestern section, was primitive. It had only two paved roads and had just begun to be platted for construction, which made it a propitious place for a carpenter. Elias contracted to help build homes, and one of his sons recalled that Flora too would go out to the sites and ""hammer and saw planks with the men."" Still, by his wife's estimate Elias averaged only seven dollars a week. But he was a Disney, and he had not surrendered his dreams. Using Robert's contacts and leveraging his own house through mortgages, he began buying plots in the subdivision, designing residences with Flora's help and then building them-small cottages for workingmen like himself. By the end of the decade he and a contracting associate had built at least two additional homes on the same street on which he lived-one of which he sold for $2,500 and the other of which he and his partner rented out for income. In effect, under Robert's tutelage, Elias had become a real estate maven, albeit an extremely modest one.But by this time, already in his forties, he had begun to place his hope less in success, which seemed hard-won and capricious, than in faith. Both the Disneys and the Calls had been deeply religious, and Elias and Flora's social life in Chicago now orbited the nearby Congregational church, of which they were among the most devoted members. When the congregation decided to reorganize and then voted to erect a new building just two blocks from the Disneys' home, Elias was named a trustee as well as a member of the building committee. By the time the new church, St. Paul's, was dedicated in October 1900, the family was attending services not only on Sundays but during the week. Occasionally, when the minister was absent, Elias would even take the pulpit. ""[H]e was a pretty good preacher,"" Flora would remember. ""[H]e did a lot of that at home, you know."" . . .'"

"'06-12-03,'0','It would have taken a bold soul to forecast that Safin would be the main man in Moscow after he spent Friday, the opening day of this final, playing the world-weary foil to David Nalbandian during a straight-set loss and whining at length about the surface that his own team had chosen.But Safin has been 21st century tennis’s most unpredictable talent. Who could have guessed that, in his first Grand Slam final, he would demolish the all-time great Pete Sampras at the 2000 United States Open without the loss of a set? Who could have guessed, having witnessed that awesome display, that he would win only one more major singles title in the six years that followed?“The difference came in childhood,” said the Russian Davis Cup captain Shamil Tarpishchev, who has known Safin since he was a boy. “At that time, Safin was never motivated to be the best in the world. He is, in a way, an artist.”Safin is ranked No. 26 at age 26. The big man’s desire and health have indeed waxed and waned, but if what he accomplished here was not quite a masterpiece, it was certainly a memorable addition to his body of work.After his deeply unconvincing start, it all came together again on Saturday and Sunday in his native Moscow.On Saturday, he and partner Dmitry Tursunov overpowered Nalbandian and Agustin Calleri, 6-2, 6-3, 6-3 in well under two hours with some phenomenal serving to give Russia a 2-1 lead.“That was a big surprise for us, the way we lost that doubles,” said the Argentine captain, Alberto Mancini.On Sunday, after Nalbandian had dominated Nikolay Davydenko, 6-2, 6-2, 4-6, 6-4 to force a decisive fifth match, Safin swaggered back on court and took over.In 2002, when Russia won its first Davis Cup, in France, Safin swept both his singles matches and lost the doubles. Four years later, Safin again accounted for two points as Russian finally won the Cup at home after losing the 1994 and 1995 finals in Olympic Stadium, to Sweden and then to a United States team led by Sampras.“I think, for me, this one means more,” said Safin, who struggled with his focus and a chronic knee problem after winning the 2005 Australian Open. “I’m coming off a tough injury. I honestly didn’t know if I could play tennis again.”Neither he nor Acasuso was a sure thing to play on Sunday. Mancini had selected Juan Ignacio Chela to play the opening singles match on Friday against Davydenko, which Chela lost. But Acasuso had beaten Safin in two of their previous three meetings, even if those two victories had come on the clay courts he favors. Mancini also figured Acasuso’s legs might be fresher than Safin’s.Meanwhile, Tarpishchev was hesitating between Safin or Tursunov, the California-based powerhouse with the fine sense of humor and dead serious approach to Davis Cup singles. His record is a remarkable 5-0 thus far, and he already had won decisive matches against Richard Gasquet of France and Andy Roddick of the United States this year.But Tarpishchev, who has a well-earned reputation for playing the right hunch, took the artist over the blogger; the veteran over the newcomer. “What spoke in Marat’s favor was the experience he had in such matches,” Tarpishchev said. “He’s been through all the trials and tribulations in his career.”This time, Safin had to deal with soreness in his knees and his heel. “This surface is pretty hard, and I’m pretty old, but it turned out good,” he said.Perhaps the surface – a rubberized medium-speed court that was used for this year’s Kremlin Cup tournament in which Safin reached the final ¬ wasn’t so unfavorable after all?“I would still say this surface suits Nalbandian best,” Safin said. “But it’s not the best surface for Jose Acasuso. It’s a bit too fast for him.”Safin is not as quick laterally as in his prime, which leads to more errors on groundstrokes. But his serve is still a force of nature, and he had 16 aces and no double faults on Sunday, putting 64 percent of his first serves into play.He was not the only one serving well in the fourth set. He and Acasuso lost a combined three points on serve until the tiebreaker. “I think if I could have made Marat play longer points in the fourth, it would have been better for me,” Acasuso said. “He’d already played the two previous days.”With Acasuso serving at 1-2 in the tiebreaker, Safin whipped a backhand down the line, and Acasuso whiffed on the forehand. The door to the victory was ajar, and Safin managed to keep it open. Acasuso did save the first match point at 4-6 when Safin knocked a forehand long. Acasuso looked as if he would save the second at 5-6, too, when he dictated play and moved forward to strike that forehand with about 500 Argentines in Moscow ready to leap high with delight along with the millions more Argentines watching on television in Buenos Aires and beyond.But unlike Maradona, creator of the Hand of God, Acasuso had no timely trick up his short sleeve. The forehand struck the net, and Safin, who had shaken Maradona’s hand on Saturday after the doubles, was the one claiming inspiration. “Maradona passed on that Hand of God to me,” Safin said, with a laugh.Argentina has now lost two Davis Cup finals, the first a much more lopsided affair in 1981 against the United States. “There are always nerves when you play Davis Cup and represent your country,” Acasuso said. “But I believe I did it well, and I believe I did all I could.”Perhaps that will make it easier to deal with the disappointment in the future, but on Sunday, as the Russians gathered around the most important team trophy in tennis and the red-eyed Acasuso struggled to keep his composure, it seemed like very little consolation.'"
"'06-12-03,'0','“This will be one of the most important compounds of our generation,” said Jeffrey B. Kindler, Pfizer’s chief executive.Pfizer is the world’s biggest drug company, with 106,000 employees and $51 billion in sales in 2005.In a news release issued yesterday, the company said that it would immediately halt clinical trials of the drug and end its development.The decision was based on interim results from a 15,000-patient clinical trial. The trial, called Illuminate, was scheduled to be completed in 2009. Pfizer had hoped it would prove that the combination of the two drugs was significantly more likely to reduce heart attacks and strokes than Lipitor alone does.Even before yesterday’s announcement, some cardiologists had raised concerns about torcetrapib, noting that the drug raised blood pressure in many patients, a serious side effect for a heart medicine. But Pfizer said those concerns would prove to be unfounded, arguing that torcetrapib’s effects on good cholesterol would overwhelm its negative impact on blood pressure.At this point, it is unclear whether the drug’s failure was due to a specific problem with its chemistry or whether other drugs to raise good cholesterol will also face unexpected problems in clinical trials. Pfizer has other drugs similar to torcetrapib in its pipeline, but they are in much earlier stages of development.For Pfizer, the end of the torcetrapib program is an enormous blow. Drugs for heart disease are among the most widely used prescription medicines. Lipitor, another Pfizer drug, is the best-selling drug in the world, with sales of $13 billion this year.The company and investors had expected that torcetrapib would be another big seller, making up for sales that Pfizer will lose when Lipitor loses patent protection in the United States in 2010.Despite a research budget of $7 billion annually, Pfizer has had difficulty bringing important new drugs to market this decade and its near-term pipeline of new drugs is also thin. On Tuesday, the company said it would cut 20 percent of its American sales force, almost 2,400 employees. Yesterday, it said it intended to accelerate its restructuring because of torcetrapib’s failure.Pfizer had planned to sell the drug both as a stand-alone drug and in combination with Lipitor. The company had said it expected to file for federal approval in 2007 based on data from other clinical trials that will also be halted.'"
"'06-12-03,'0','“I really don’t believe that anyone outside of this football program believed that we were going to win this game,” Bruins tailback Chris Markey said. “I think some people’s parents were skeptical.”But U.C.L.A. (7-5, 5-4 Pacific-10) removed any doubt when Eric McNeal, a senior linebacker, intercepted U.S.C. quarterback John David Booty with 1 minute 10 seconds remaining in the fourth quarter and the Trojans driving toward a game-winning touchdown. McNeal tipped a third-down pass intended for Steve Smith, then caught the ball and fell to the ground at the Bruins’ 20, sealing the biggest victory in Karl Dorrell’s four seasons as the coach.And like U.S.C.’s loss to Texas here in January in the national championship game, this loss was costly for the Trojans. U.S.C. (10-2, 7-2) has won 55 of its past 59 games, and two of the losses have come at the Rose Bowl within the past year.Both derailed the Trojans’ chances for a national title. They had been everything but anointed to play Ohio State until their offense got stuck in neutral Saturday, converting just 6 of 17 third downs.U.S.C.’s consolation prize will be a return trip to the Rose Bowl, where it is expected to play either Michigan (if Florida makes it to the title game) or Louisiana State.“We had a great opportunity here that we let get away.”U.S.C. never established a running game, finishing with 55 yards and an average of 1.9 yards a carry. It also never put together a coherent passing game, as Booty finished 23 for 39 with no touchdowns, two sacks and the interception that sealed the game.Booty’s play was mediocre and he did not receive much help from his offensive line, which allowed the Bruins to get consistent pressure and was flagged for four false-start penalties. U.C.L.A. defensive ends Bruce Davis and Justin Hickman seemingly spent the day in the Trojan backfield.The U.S.C. offensive line coach, Pat Ruel, searched for the right words after the game, and his analysis ranged from “out of synch” to “maybe a little tentative.”The offensive line’s struggles led to a poor day by Dwayne Jarrett, U.S.C.’s star receiver, who finished with just four catches for 68 yards.“They just did a great job in their defensive scheme of not giving Booty enough time to read down the field and look at the receivers,” Jarrett said. “It was definitely the most pressure we’ve faced; there was no time at all.”Fittingly, the Bruins defense provided one of the game’s defining momentum shifts on the first play of the fourth quarter. Leading by 10-9, the Bruins stuffed the Trojans on a fourth-and-2. Verner met C. J. Gable in the backfield and flipped him to the ground for a 4-yard loss.U.C.L.A. took over on the its own 40, and quarterback Patrick Cowan led a drive that ended with Justin Medlock’s second field goal of the half, this one from 31 yards.From there, U.C.L.A. held on, with the game not officially ending until a Booty heave to near midfield landed harmlessly on the turf.The Bruins won despite just 235 yards of total offense and they did not complete a pass of more than 21 yard.“I’m not going to sleep tonight,” Markey said, smiling. “I’m not going to sleep for days.”Much like folks in Ann Arbor, Mich., and Gainesville, Fla., but for very different reasons.'"
"'06-12-03,'0','BEIRUT, Lebanon, Dec. 2 — The center of this city remained paralyzed and shuttered on Saturday as thousands of pro-Hezbollah protesters entered the second day of a sit-in aimed at forcing the Western-backed government to resign.The atmosphere remained festive, almost joyous, though, as protesters emerged from tents pitched in empty lots and chanted slogans, banged drums and appeared to dig in for a long stay.A small group of mostly young men pressed close to the swirls of razor wire that blocked the entrance to the Grand Serail, the offices of Prime Minister Fouad Siniora. On the other side were a large number of soldiers and armored vehicles.A day earlier, on Friday, hundreds of thousands of protesters from around the country poured into two areas of the city center, one south of Martyrs Square and the other in a square near the Grand Serail, in a great show of defiance to the government. But most left after sundown.On Saturday, many returned to join the thousands who had camped out. Still, the city center was calmer than on Friday.The sit-in is happening as Hezbollah and its allies, which are aligned with Syria and Iran, struggle to wrest control of the government from a collection of Sunni, Druse and Christian parties aligned with the United States and France. The government has said that it will not resign and that Hezbollah and its allies are trying to carry out what amounts to a coup.'"

The Russians opened the third set with a break and continued to dominate until Tursunov served out the match, which lasted 1 hour 38 minutes.“We didn’t want to stay out there too long and let them get in the match,” said Tursunov, who had 8 of Russia’s 11 aces. “Marat and I agreed that we would simply play our game and let them make mistakes, and that’s what they did throughout the match.”The loss was a first in doubles this season for Nalbandian, who was scheduled to play Davydenko in Sunday’s first match. Safin was to face Chela in the second match, although substitutions can be made up to an hour before the match. In reverse singles, players swap opponents from the first-day singles matches.'"
"'06-12-03,'0','The stock market started off badly on Monday, dropping more than it had in any single day since July. Wall Street fared better over the next three days, but a plunge on Friday sent the market down for the week.The decline in stocks was accompanied by a fall in the value of the dollar, which on Friday reached a 20-month low against the euro. An economic report on Friday, showing that manufacturing shrank unexpectedly in the United States, rattled the financial markets. Concern about the strength of the American economy depressed both the value of the dollar and the price of stocks.The best performer in the Dow Jones industrial average last week was Exxon Mobil, which rose 6.7 percent on rising oil prices. On Friday, the futures price of a barrel of crude for next-month delivery closed in New York at $63.43, up from $59.24 the previous week.

"'06-12-03,'0','As a result of affirmative action, black students enter law schools with well below average undergraduate grades and LSAT scores. And going back to the reason for poor undergraduate performance, selective undergraduate programs enroll black students with poor SAT scores, resulting in low grades.There is no magic set of policies, such as better mentoring, that will transform a significant proportion of weakly prepared college students so that they can be successful at the most demanding positions. Instead, we should focus on identifying potentially strong black (and other poor) intermediate and high school students, giving them the support necessary when it will be most effective.Robert Cherry Brooklyn, Nov. 29, 2006The writer is a professor of economics at Brooklyn College.While Prof. Richard H. Sander’s study finds a disparity between the grades of black and white law firm hires, that does not explain the racial disparity in success at those firms. Other studies prove beyond dispute that grades have almost nothing to do with career success.Further, grades are so subjective that it is ridiculous to suggest that law school graduates with a 3.5 are so vastly superior to those with a 3.0.As a black Ivy League law school graduate, I found that coming from a blue-collar background with only one parent having graduated from high school greatly affected my fitting into a law firm in many ways. For example, I identified with the secretaries, paralegals and even the janitors, and had a hard time telling “underlings” what to do.“Lawyers Debate Why Blacks Lag at Major Firms” did not acknowledge the many bar association- and court-sponsored diversity studies that have documented patterns of racial bias that continue to impede the progress of minorities, especially African-Americans, Latinos and Native Americans, in large law firms.Many of these studies focus on an often unconscious presumption of incompetence that clouds law firm decision-making with respect to minority attorneys. The result is that minority associates are disproportionately denied training and mentoring opportunities; early mistakes are often fatal to the advancement of minority attorneys while excused for their white peers; and desirable assignments, case referrals and opportunities for partner and client contact tend to be funneled more often to white associates.These findings belong in any discussion of the factors determining the career success of minority attorneys and the larger question of our society’s ability to achieve a diverse legal profession.“Lawyers Debate Why Blacks Lag at Major Firms” suggests that affirmative action is working. The elite law schools and prestigious law firms are giving a group that has traditionally suffered from discrimination a slight edge to get in.After that, it is (or should be) up to the individual to succeed. Affirmative action provides access to the playing field, but does not ensure success once you are on that field.It is likely that the children of these individuals, who in completing law school have already achieved considerable success, may in their turn become partners of the prestigious law firms. By that point, affirmative action may have become unnecessary and discontinued.'"
"'06-12-03,'0','I agree with Jon Shure’s concern that finger-pointing between private and public employees will benefit neither (“Pension Envy,” Op-Ed, Nov. 26), but I had to laugh at Assemblyman Paul Moriarty’s incorrect assessment of Trenton at 5 p.m. You quote him as saying, “Trenton is one of the only places where if you leave work at 5 p.m., you’ve already missed the rush hour.”I invite Mr. Moriarty to drive home one evening at 5 (or later, since he rarely leaves at 5) with my husband, who is a state worker, and see that there is most certainly a rush hour in Trenton. It takes my husband a good hour to travel 13 miles.In addition, my husband has a choice of paying almost $130 a month for garage parking, or he can park free in an unattended lot several blocks from his office building. (That many state employees must pay for their parking tends to get ignored in the outcry about their benefits.)Oh, and he drives a 7-year-old subcompact with cloth seats, Mr. Moriarty, so it may be a less comfortable ride than you are used to. Salaries for public employees are lower than those in the private sector, even if the benefits are better.Mr. Shure is right. It’s time for workers to stand together, not attack each other. And it’s time for politicians like Mr. Moriarty to concentrate on solving the many problems facing all the workers of this state — public and private.'"
"'06-12-03,'0','A 60-hour workweek, with a one-hour commute each way, means leaving the house at 7 a.m. every morning and not returning until 9 p.m. And more than half of extreme workers log longer hours than that.“It’s the American dream on steroids,” says Sylvia Ann Hewlett, who heads the task force, turning another phrase. Ms. Hewlett wrote the book “Creating a Life,” in which she argued that the most successful women are the least likely to have children.Ms. Hewlett points out that these extreme workers love their jobs, lest this become a “poor me I earn so much money” story. “They love the thrill, the meaning, the challenge, the oversized compensation packages and the brilliant colleagues.”What they don’t love is the fallout on the parts of their lives that are not work. Sixty-nine percent say their extreme jobs undermine their health, 46 percent say work gets in the way of a good relationship with their spouse, and 58 percent say it gets in the way of strong relationships with their children.And what about those children? That is a concern of both the task force study and of Catalyst, the research and consulting organization that aims to expand opportunities for women at work. Catalyst worked with the Community, Families and Work Program at Brandeis University to look specifically at stress on working parents at the office, which they call “parental concern about after-school time,” or Pcast. No, that doesn’t trip off the tongue as smoothly as extreme jobs, but in the realm of human resources, where policy is made, it might well become a term of art, because both groups have couched this not just in terms of a problem for parents, but a problem for business.“Pcast is not just bad for parents: it is bad for employers,” Catalyst says. All those dashes from work when child care falls through, all those distracted hours spent at the office knowing a child is home sick — that affects close to 50 million employees, the Catalyst study says.The task force goes further, and measures what is worrying parents who hold extreme jobs. “Has your child ever experienced any of the following because of the number of hours you work?” they were asked. “Watching too much television” (40 percent of women and 35 percent of men said yes); “acting out/discipline issues due to lack of attention” (38 percent of women, 18 percent of men); and “eating too much junk food” (34 percent of women, 12 percent of men).The solution, both groups say, is what Catalyst calls “the agile workplace.” That means a philosophy of flexibility. On the specific topic of Pcast, that could include subsidies for after-school care and backup care, and the ability to telecommute.The alternative, the task force warns, is that today’s distracted and overworked employees will become tomorrow’s drag on the bottom line. “The culture that celebrates the extreme ethos today may tire of it — quite literally — tomorrow,” Ms. Hewlett writes. If so, she will need to coin another term. “Expired workers,” perhaps?'"
"'06-12-03,'0','“Why Property Taxes Are All Over the Charts” (Nov. 26) mentioned that county taxes account for some of the abnormally high property taxation in New York, as compared with Connecticut, where county government has been eliminated. Separately, the article noted that municipalities with high “ratables” (commercial property taxpayers) might be reluctant to combine with residential areas lacking a comparable commercial base.Putting these two observations together, why isn’t part of the solution for counties to levy county taxes in a manner that accomplishes de facto combination by reducing county tax rates levied upon homes in areas that have lower ratables? This would also reduce the tax burden on communities that, on average, require fewer social services.As for the role of state aid to education, taxpayers in New York State subsidize state spending for New York City schools. City taxpayers pay 5 to 10 percent of Westchester tax rates per dollar value of residential real estate, with the shortfall borne by other state taxpayers. Of course, nothing like this occurs in New Jersey or Connecticut.Regardless of the relative property values of the villages of Pelham and Pelham Manor, sharing of duplicated services would benefit both villages in proportion to their relative tax assessments, and would not penalize the residents of a village with the more valuable property.The residents of the village with the higher tax assessments would get the greater refund. The resultant tax savings for an individual household would be directly proportional to the property tax paid, and would be “village blind.” Thus, if you live in a $2 million home, you currently pay double what the resident in the $1 million home pays in taxes, but you would also receive twice the abatement once attritional decreases in municipal spending took effect.'"

"'06-12-03,'0','IT was the growing national problem of identity theft that prompted the village attorney, Gerald L. Lotto, to draft an ordinance in Lake Grove making it a crime to dig through someone’s garbage.That law, drafted by Mr. Lotto and passed unanimously by the village board this fall, “was simple logic,” he said.“When I listened to reports from companies that sell shredders, I heard that the most common source of gaining access to confidential documents is your own relatives or friends,” Mr. Lotto said. “And following close behind is your garbage. So it seemed simple — we could do something to stop vandals from digging into people’s garbage for the purpose of ID theft.”The new law categorizes sealed garbage, in a receptacle with a lid on it, as private property until it is hauled away by a garbage truck. Someone caught rummaging through residential trash can be sentenced to up to 15 days in jail, fined up to $250, or both.“This should scare some people,” Mr. Lotto said. “And that was our only intention.”He said that identity theft has not been a particular problem in Lake Grove, a village of about 11,000 that has become a commercial hub and includes the Smith Haven Mall. But the risk exists, Mr. Lotto said.'"
"'06-12-03,'0','“If you look at some of Adolph’s work, he was a lyricist writing contemporary musicals about life in New York City,” Mr. Seller said. “And ‘High Fidelity’ is a contemporary musical about what it’s like to live in New York City.”Sitting in the conference room of Mr. Seller’s company, the Producing Office, Ms. Green, 41, was working on what she hoped would be the Act II showstopper, “11:00 Number.” The show’s monthlong tryout at the Colonial Theater in Boston had gotten decidedly mixed reviews, and the creative team has been working furiously on revisions before the opening on Thursday at the Imperial Theater. “It’s a hard moment to nail, but we’re zeroing in on it,” she said, snapping shut her laptop. “The thing about musicals is you keep writing until they say: ‘Time’s up. You have to put your pencil down.’ ”Ms. Green speaks with considerable authority here. She and the show’s composer, Tom Kitt, who met in 1997 at a BMI Musical Theater writing workshop, have been working on “High Fidelity” for five years. (David Lindsay-Abaire, whose play “Rabbit Hole” was nominated for a Tony award last year, wrote the book, with Walter Bobbie directing. The show is co-produced by Mr. Seller, Robyn Goodman and Kevin McCollum.)“When we started the project, we were our own bosses, and we were, like, ‘Hey, let’s write a song this week,’ ” said Ms. Green, who estimated that she and Mr. Kitt have written and jettisoned some 22 songs. “Now it’s ‘Let’s write a song tomorrow because we have to put it in the show tomorrow night.’ ”For Ms. Green the stint at the Colonial Theater was more than a tryout, it was also a sentimental journey. “I remember spending a weekend with my dad there when ‘On the Twentieth Century,’ was trying out,” said Ms. Green, referring to the 1978 Tony Award-winning musical. “My dad and Betty were ebullient, greeting everyone with hugs and laughter, the mayors of the theater.”In an e-mail message that Ms. Green sent after reading Ms. Comden’s obituary, she said: “I was taken aback to see a relatively recent picture of her and my dad which I had never seen before, and it took my breath away. Their deep affection for, and connection with, one another — their whole story is right there in that photograph.”Ms. Green has images of them “hunched together over their notepads, glowering and scribbling furiously during a number, then charging down the aisle to confer with the director. My dad chewed gum endlessly. He also chewed on the filters of unlit cigarettes,” after he had given up smoking.“I wasn’t there to see it — I hadn’t been born yet — but my dad loved to tell the story of an out-of-town tryout for a show he did with Betty and Jule Styne. It was 2 a.m. They were in a hotel room scrambling to write a new number. They all were huge passionate personalities and had had a huge fight. Jule blew up, stormed out, then moments later came back in totally naked and danced a jig, and everyone roared with laughter.”Despite Ms. Green’s pedigree, or perhaps because of it, “writing for musical theater didn’t naturally occur to me for some reason,” she said, breaking into a big infectious laugh. “I’m sure my shrink would have something to say about that. I’m sure all the shrinks in New York would have something to say about that.”Ms. Green was raised on the Upper West Side in a swirl of Broadway celebrity. (Her mother, the actress Phyllis Newman, met Mr. Green when she successfully auditioned to be Judy Holliday’s understudy in “Bells Are Ringing.”) At her parents’ frequent parties Leonard Bernstein might “be at the piano, and then Jule Styne would take over and then Cy Coleman,” she recalled. “It was exciting and fun and raucous. They trotted me out, and I did my numbers. I had a nice little belt. My ‘Bali H’ai’ brought the house down.”When Amanda was 9, she starred as Maria in her camp’s production of “West Side Story.” “I got an opening night telegram from Lenny,” she said, referring to Mr. Bernstein. “I had a pretty incredible childhood in that respect.”Ms. Green’s adulthood has been pretty incredible too. Three years ago, when she released a CD of her lyrics and vocals, “Put a Little Love in Your Mouth,” Steven Sondheim sent her a fan letter that has pride of place in the West Side apartment she shares with her husband, Jeffrey Kaplan, an orthopedic surgeon. At the couple’s wedding seven years ago they danced to one of Ms. Green’s favorite Comden-Green songs “Lucky to Be Me.”The first composing that this quintessentially New York City denizen tried, though, was country music — in Tennessee: “I was interested in pop music and I fell in love with Lyle Lovett’s writing. He was writing witty songs, and that’s what I wanted to do. So I went to Nashville in the mid-90s and wrote country music for a while. I never had great success there, but I loved doing it.”Back in New York, Ms. Green heard about the BMI workshop, “and I went to do that and immediately thought: ‘What have I been wasting my time for? This is where I belong,’ ” she said. “I was so happy to be writing for characters and situations.”The BMI program also redirected Ms. Green’s ambitions. Originally her focus had been on performing. After graduating from Brown University she attended an actors’ training program at Circle in the Square and spent two seasons at Williamstown Theater. She began writing songs and singing them in New York cabarets, like Joe’s Pub, with Mr. Kitt as her musical director. “It was a way I could be working and expressing myself, and be doing things besides waiting tables,” she said. And “I was a terrible, terrible, waitress.”While “High Fidelity” is her first Broadway musical, she has tried her hand at a few other works: “Up the Week Without a Paddle,” a sort of West Coast “Sex in the City” that she wrote with Curtis Moore, had a run in Los Angeles in the summer of 2000. “For the Love of Tiffany,” a send-up of Lifetime network movies, also written with Mr. Moore, was part of the 2003 New York City Fringe Festival. In addition to supplying the show’s lyrics, Ms. Green played a triple amputee housekeeper. “That,” she said, “was a lot of fun.”Asked about the similarities between father and daughter, Phyllis Newman said that Amanda “has the great gift that my husband had of total focus and commitment to her work. She’s not sloppy, nor was he.”She added that Mr. Green went to every one of their daughter’s cabaret performances. Ms. Green, who once wrote a musical tribute to her father called “On Daddy’s Shoulders,” remembers what those ringside visits were like. “He’d come to a show and say: ‘My kid is the greatest. No kidding. And it’s not just because she’s my daughter. I swear it,’ ” she said. “I just wanted to go under the table because I knew what they were all thinking: It’s because it’s his daughter.”In an e-mail message, Ms. Green wrote of Ms. Comden: “Her passing away feels not only like losing her, but also like losing him all over again. And it makes me sad to think of a world without Comden & Green.”She continued: “Selfishly, I wish she and my father could be here for ‘High Fidelity.’ It would have been a helluva’n opening night!”'"
"'06-12-03,'0','PART of the mythology that has grown up around “Star Trek” is that the 1970s were the show’s lost decade. Canceled in 1969, the series didn’t yield its first feature film, “Star Trek: The Motion Picture,” until 10 years later. In between, the legend goes, Trekkies had to content themselves with conventions where they could swap trivia, splurge on merchandise and otherwise fail to get a life.But here’s the surprise: From 1973 to 1974, the inescapable science-fiction franchise spawned an all-but-forgotten Saturday morning cartoon series that more closely resembled its parent show than any of the prime-time spinoffs or theatrical releases that followed.Known today as “Star Trek: The Animated Series” (“ST: TAS” for short) and just out on DVD, this incarnation’s 22 half-hour episodes are manna for Trek purists. Here is the old U.S.S. Enterprise, still plodding along on its first five-year mission. Here are those trademark pajama-top uniforms, feyly flared trousers and black go-go boots. Most important, here is the familiar lineup of Captain Kirk, Mr. Spock, et al., their voices supplied by William Shatner, Leonard Nimoy and most of the show’s other original actors.Produced by Filmation, “ST: TAS” was able to go where no inexpensive live-action TV series could afford to go before. Freed from the constraints of tiny sound stages and even tinier budgets, Filmation’s artists could conjure up outlandish aliens, epic space battles, exotic civilizations and other fantastic scenarios. For the most part the quality of the stories matched the visuals. A critic for The Los Angeles Times declared that the show was “as out of place in the Saturday morning kiddie ghetto as a Mercedes is in a soapbox derby.”By popular acclaim, the best episode was “Yesteryear” by D. C. Fontana, a story editor on the original series and associate producer of its cartoon version. A time-travel yarn that returned Mr. Spock to his Vulcan childhood, “Yesteryear” depicted the pointy-eared science officer enduring a traumatic coming-of-age survival ritual, capped by the death of a beloved pet. This was pretty bracing stuff for preteenagers, and one reason “ST: TAS” won an Emmy for best children’s series.'"
"'06-12-03,'0','Burton, who has since left the D.I.A., is not alone in his concern. Indeed, throughout the intelligence community, spies are beginning to wonder why their technology has fallen so far behind — and talk among themselves about how to catch up. Some of the country’s most senior intelligence thinkers have joined the discussion, and surprisingly, many of them believe the answer may lie in the interactive tools the world’s teenagers are using to pass around YouTube videos and bicker online about their favorite bands. Billions of dollars’ worth of ultrasecret data networks couldn’t help spies piece together the clues to the worst terrorist plot ever. So perhaps, they argue, it’ s time to try something radically different. Could blogs and wikis prevent the next 9/11?The job of an analyst used to be much more stable — even sedate. In the ’70s and ’80s, during the cold war, an intelligence analyst would show up for work at the C.I.A.’s headquarters in Langley, Va., or at the National Security Agency compound in Fort Meade, Md., and face a mess of paper. All day long, tips, memos and reports from field agents would arrive: cables from a covert-ops spy in Moscow describing a secret Soviet meeting, or perhaps fresh pictures of a missile silo. An analyst’s job was to take these raw pieces of intelligence and find patterns in the noise. In a crisis, his superiors might need a quick explanation of current events to pass on to their agency heads or to Congress. But mostly he was expected to perform long-term “strategic analysis” — to detect entirely new threats that were still forming.And during the cold war, threats formed slowly. The Soviet Union was a ponderous bureaucracy that moved at the glacial speed of the five-year plan. Analysts studied the emergence of new tanks and missiles, pieces of hardware that took years to develop. One year, an analyst might report that the keel for a Soviet nuclear submarine had been laid; a few years later, a follow-up report would describe the submarine’s completion; even more years later, a final report would detail the sea trials. Writing reports was thus a leisurely affair, taking weeks or months; thousands of copies were printed up and distributed via interoffice mail. If an analyst’s report impressed his superiors, they’d pass it on to their superiors, and they to theirs — until, if the analyst was very lucky, it landed eventually in the president’s inner circle. But this sort of career achievement was rare. Of the thousands of analyst reports produced each year, the majority sat quietly gathering dust on agency shelves, unread by anyone.Analysts also did not worry about anything other than their corners of the world. Russia experts focused on Russia, Nicaragua ones on Nicaragua. Even after the cold war ended, the major spy agencies divided up the world: the F.B.I. analyzed domestic crime, the C.I.A. collected intelligence internationally and military spy agencies, like the National Security Agency and National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, evaluated threats to the national defense. If an analyst requested information from another agency, that request traveled through elaborate formal channels. The walls between the agencies were partly a matter of law. The charters of the C.I.A. and the defense intelligence agencies prohibited them from spying on American citizens, under the logic that the intrusive tactics needed to investigate foreign threats would violate constitutional rights if applied at home. The F.B.I. even had an internal separation: agents investigating terrorist activity would not share information with those investigating crimes, worried that secrets gleaned from tailing Al Qaeda operatives might wind up publicly exposed in a criminal trial.Then on Sept. 12, 2001, analysts showed up at their desks and faced a radically altered job. Islamist terrorists, as 9/11 proved, behaved utterly unlike the Soviet Union. They were rapid-moving, transnational and cellular. A corner-store burglar in L.A. might turn out to be a Qaeda sympathizer raising money for a plot being organized overseas. An imam in suburban Detroit could be recruiting local youths to send to the Sudan for paramilitary training. Al Qaeda operatives organized their plots in a hivelike fashion, with collaborators from Afghanistan to London using e-mail, instant messaging and Yahoo groups; rarely did a single mastermind run the show. To disrupt these new plots, some intelligence officials concluded, American agents and analysts would need to cooperate just as fluidly — trading tips quickly among agents and agencies. Following the usual chain of command could be fatal. “To fight a network like Al Qaeda, you need to behave like a network,” John Arquilla, the influential professor of defense at the Naval Postgraduate School, told me.It was a fine vision. But analysts were saddled with technology that was designed in the cold war. They now at least had computers, and intelligence arrived as electronic messages instead of paper memos. But their computers still communicated almost exclusively with people inside their agencies. When the intelligence services were computerized in the ’90s, they had digitally replicated their cold-war divisions — each one building a multimillion-dollar system that allowed the agency to share information internally but not readily with anyone outside.The computer systems were designed to be “air gapped.” The F.B.I. terminals were connected to one another — but not to the computers at any other agency, and vice versa. Messages written on the C.I.A.’s network (which they still quaintly called “cables”) were purely internal. To get a message to the F.B.I. required a special communication called a “telegraphic dissemination.” Each agency had databases to amass intelligence, but because of the air gap, other agencies could not easily search them. The divisions were partly because of turf battles and partly because of legal restrictions — but they were also technological. Mike Scheuer, an adviser to the C.I.A.’s bin Laden unit until 2004, told me he had been frustrated by the inability of the systems to interpenetrate. “About 80 percent of C.I.A.-F.B.I. difficulties came from the fact that we couldn’t communicate with one another,” he said. Scheuer told me he would often send a document electronically to the F.B.I., then call to make sure the agents got it. “And they’d say, ‘We can’t find it, can you fax it?’ And then we’d call, and they’d say, ‘Well, the system said it came in, but we still can’t find it — so could you courier it over?’ ” “These systems have served us very well for five decades,” Dale Meyerrose told me when I spoke with him recently. But now, he said, they’re getting in the way. “The 16 intelligence organizations of the U.S. are without peer. They are the best in the world. The trick is, are they collectively the best?”Last year, Meyerrose, a retired Air Force major general, was named the chief information officer — the head computer guy, as it were — for the office of the director of national intelligence. Established by Congress in 2004, the D.N.I.’s office has a controversial mandate: it is supposed to report threats to the president and persuade the intelligence agencies to cooperate more closely. Both tasks were formerly the role of the C.I.A. director, but since the C.I.A. director had no budgetary power over the other agencies, they rarely heeded his calls to pass along their secrets. So the new elevated position of national-intelligence director was created; ever since, it has been filled by John Negroponte. Last December, Negroponte hired Meyerrose and gave him the daunting task of developing mechanisms to allow the various agencies’ aging and incompatible systems to swap data. Right away, Meyerrose ordered some sweeping changes. In the past, each agency chose its own outside contractor to build customized software — creating proprietary systems, each of which stored data in totally different file formats. From now on, Meyerrose said, each agency would have to build new systems using cheaper, off-the-shelf software so they all would be compatible. But bureaucratic obstacles were just a part of the problem Meyerrose faced. He was also up against something deeper in the DNA of the intelligence services. “We’ve had this ‘need to know’ culture for years,” Meyerrose said. “Well, we need to move to a ‘need to share’ philosophy.”There was already one digital pipeline that joined the agencies (though it had its own limitations): Intelink, which connects most offices in each intelligence agency. It was created in 1994 after C.I.A. officials saw how the Web was rapidly transforming the way private-sector companies shared information. Intelink allows any agency to publish a Web page, or put a document or a database online, secure in the knowledge that while other agents and analysts can access it, the outside world cannot.So why hasn’t Intelink given young analysts instant access to all secrets from every agency? Because each agency’s databases, and the messages flowing through their internal pipelines, are not automatically put onto Intelink. Agency supervisors must actively decide what data they will publish on the network — and their levels of openness vary. Some departments have created slick, professional sites packed full of daily alerts and searchable collections of their reports going back years. Others have put up little more than a “splash page” announcing they exist. Operational information — like details of a current covert action — is rarely posted, usually because supervisors fear that a leak could jeopardize a delicate mission.Nonetheless, Intelink has grown to the point that it contains thousands of agency sites and several hundred databases. Analysts at the various agencies generate 50,000 official reports a year, many of which are posted to the network. The volume of material online is such that analysts now face a new problem: data overload. Even if they suspect good information might exist on Intelink, it is often impossible to find it. The system is poorly indexed, and its internal search tools perform like the pre-Google search engines of the ’90s.“One of my daily searches is for words like ‘Afghanistan’ or ‘Taliban,’ ” I was told by one young military analyst who specializes in threats from weapons of mass destruction. (He requested anonymity because he isn’t authorized to speak to reporters.) “So I’m looking for reports from field agents saying stuff like, ‘I’m out here, and here’s what I saw,’ ” he continued. “But I get to my desk and I’ve got, like, thousands a day — mountains of information, and no way to organize it.”Adding to the information glut, there’s an increasingly large amount of data to read outside of Intelink. Intelligence analysts are finding it more important to keep up with “open source” information — nonclassified material published in full public view, like newspapers, jihadist blogs and discussion boards in foreign countries. This adds ever more calories to the daily info diet. The W.M.D. analyst I spoke to regularly reads the blog of Juan Cole, a University of Michigan professor known for omnivorous linking to, and acerbic analysis of, news from the Middle East. “He’s not someone spies would normally pay attention to, but now he’s out there — and he’s a subject-matter expert, right?” the analyst said.Intelligence hoarding presented one set of problems, but pouring it into a common ocean, Meyerrose realized soon after moving into his office, is not the answer either. “Intelligence is about looking for needles in haystacks, and we can’t just keep putting more hay on the stack,” he said. What the agencies needed was a way to take the thousands of disparate, unorganized pieces of intel they generate every day and somehow divine which are the most important.Intelligence heads wanted to try to find some new answers to this problem. So the C.I.A. set up a competition, later taken over by the D.N.I., called the Galileo Awards: any employee at any intelligence agency could submit an essay describing a new idea to improve information sharing, and the best ones would win a prize. The first essay selected was by Calvin Andrus, chief technology officer of the Center for Mission Innovation at the C.I.A. In his essay, “The Wiki and the Blog: Toward a Complex Adaptive Intelligence Community,” Andrus posed a deceptively simple question: How did the Internet become so useful in helping people find information?Andrus argued that the real power of the Internet comes from the boom in self-publishing: everyday people surging online to impart their thoughts and views. He was particularly intrigued by Wikipedia, the “reader-authored” encyclopedia, where anyone can edit an entry or create a new one without seeking permission from Wikipedia’s owners. This open-door policy, as Andrus noted, allows Wikipedia to cover new subjects quickly. The day of the London terrorist bombings, Andrus visited Wikipedia and noticed that barely minutes after the attacks, someone had posted a page describing them. Over the next hour, other contributors — some physically in London, with access to on-the-spot details — began adding more information and correcting inaccurate news reports. “You could just sit there and hit refresh, refresh, refresh, and get a sort of ticker-tape experience,” Andrus told me. What most impressed Andrus was Wikipedia’s self-governing nature. No central editor decreed what subjects would be covered. Individuals simply wrote pages on subjects that interested them — and then like-minded readers would add new facts or fix errors. Blogs, Andrus noted, had the same effect: they leveraged the wisdom of the crowd. When a blogger finds an interesting tidbit of news, he posts a link to it, along with a bit of commentary. Then other bloggers find that link and, if they agree it’s an interesting news item, post their own links pointing to it. This produces a cascade effect. Whatever the first blogger pointed toward can quickly amass so many links pointing in its direction that it rockets to worldwide notoriety in a matter of hours.Spies, Andrus theorized, could take advantage of these rapid, self-organizing effects. If analysts and agents were encouraged to post personal blogs and wikis on Intelink — linking to their favorite analyst reports or the news bulletins they considered important — then mob intelligence would take over. In the traditional cold-war spy bureaucracy, an analyst’s report lived or died by the whims of the hierarchy. If he was in the right place on the totem pole, his report on Soviet missiles could be pushed up higher; if a supervisor chose to ignore it, the report essentially vanished. Blogs and wikis, in contrast, work democratically. Pieces of intel would receive attention merely because other analysts found them interesting. This grass-roots process, Andrus argued, suited the modern intelligence challenge of sifting through thousands of disparate clues: if a fact or observation struck a chord with enough analysts, it would snowball into popularity, no matter what their supervisors thought.A profusion of spy blogs and wikis would have another, perhaps even more beneficial impact. It would drastically improve the search engines of Intelink. In a paper that won an honorable mention in the Galileo Awards, Matthew Burton — the young former D.I.A. analyst — made this case. He pointed out that the best Internet search engines, including Google, all use “link analysis” to measure the authority of documents. When you type the search “Afghanistan” into Google, it finds every page that includes that word. Then it ranks the pages in part by how many links point to the page — based on the idea that if many bloggers and sites have linked to a page, it must be more useful than others. To do its job well, Google relies on the links that millions of individuals post online every day.This, Burton pointed out, is precisely the problem with Intelink. It has no links, no social information to help sort out which intel is significant and which isn’t. When an analyst’s report is posted online, it does not include links to other reports, even ones it cites. There’s no easy way for agents to link to a report or post a comment about it. Searching Intelink thus resembles searching the Internet before blogs and Google came along — a lot of disconnected information, hard to sort through. If spies were encouraged to blog on Intelink, Burton reasoned, their profuse linking could mend that situation. “Imagine having tools that could spot emerging patterns for you and guide you to documents that might be the missing pieces of evidence you’re looking for,” Burton wrote in his Galileo paper. “Analytical puzzles, like terror plots, are often too piecemeal for individual brains to put together. Having our documents aware of each other would be like hooking several brains up in a line, so that each one knows what the others know, making the puzzle much easier to solve.”With Andrus and Burton’s vision in mind, you can almost imagine how 9/11 might have played out differently. In Phoenix, the F.B.I. agent Kenneth Williams might have blogged his memo noting that Al Qaeda members were engaging in flight-training activity. The agents observing a Qaeda planning conference in Malaysia could have mentioned the attendance of a Saudi named Khalid al-Midhar; another agent might have added that he held a multi-entry American visa. The F.B.I. agents who snared Zacarias Moussaoui in Minnesota might have written about their arrest of a flight student with violent tendencies. Other agents and analysts who were regular readers of these blogs would have found the material interesting, linked to it, pointed out connections or perhaps entered snippets of it into a wiki page discussing this new trend of young men from the Middle East enrolling in pilot training.As those four original clues collected more links pointing toward them, they would have amassed more and more authority in the Intelink search engine. Any analysts doing searches for “Moussaoui” or “Al Qaeda” or even “flight training” would have found them. Indeed, the original agents would have been considerably more likely to learn of one another’s existence and perhaps to piece together the topography of the 9/11 plot. No one was able to prevent 9/11 because nobody connected the dots. But in a system like this, as Andrus’s theory goes, the dots are inexorably drawn together. “Once the intelligence community has a robust and mature wiki and blog knowledge-sharing Web space,” Andrus concluded in his essay, “the nature of intelligence will change forever.”At first glance, the idea might seem slightly crazy. Outfit the C.I.A. and the F.B.I. with blogs and wikis? In the civilian world, after all, these online tools have not always amassed the most stellar reputations. There are many valuable blogs and wikis, of course, but they are vastly outnumbered by ones that exist to compile useless ephemera, celebrity gossip and flatly unverifiable assertions. Nonetheless, Andrus’s ideas struck a chord with many very senior members of the office of the director of national intelligence. This fall, I met with two of them: Thomas Fingar, the patrician head of analysis for the D.N.I., and Mike Wertheimer, his chief technology officer, whose badge clip sports a button that reads “geek.” If it is Meyerrose’s job to coax spy hardware to cooperate, it is Fingar’s job to do the same for analysts.Fingar and Wertheimer are now testing whether a wiki could indeed help analysts do their job. In the fall of 2005, they joined forces with C.I.A. wiki experts to build a prototype of something called Intellipedia, a wiki that any intelligence employee with classified clearance could read and contribute to. To kick-start the content, C.I.A. analysts seeded it with hundreds of articles from nonclassified documents like the C.I.A. World Fact Book. In April, they sent out e-mail to other analysts inviting them to contribute, and sat back to see what happened.By this fall, more than 3,600 members of the intelligence services had contributed a total of 28,000 pages. Chris Rasmussen, a 31-year-old “knowledge management” engineer at the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, spends part of every day writing or editing pages. Rasmussen is part of the younger generation in the intelligence establishment that is completely comfortable online; he regularly logs into a sprawling, 50-person chat room with other Intellipedians, and he also blogs about his daily work for all other spies to read. He told me the usefulness of Intellipedia proved itself just a couple of months ago, when a small two-seater plane crashed into a Manhattan building. An analyst created a page within 20 minutes, and over the next two hours it was edited 80 times by employees of nine different spy agencies, as news trickled out. Together, they rapidly concluded the crash was not a terrorist act. “In the intelligence community, there are so many ‘Stay off the grass’ signs,” Rasmussen said. “But here, you’re free to do what you want, and it works.”By the late summer, Fingar decided the Intellipedia experiment was sufficiently successful that he would embark on an even more high-profile project: using Intellipedia to produce a “national intelligence estimate” for Nigeria. An N.I.E. is an authoritative snapshot of what the intelligence community thinks about a particular state — and a guide for foreign and military policy. Nigeria, Fingar said, is a complex country, with issues ranging from energy to Islamic radicalism to polio outbreaks to a coming election. Intellipedia’s Nigeria page will harness the smarts of the dozen or so analysts who specialize in the country. But it will also, Fingar hopes, attract contributions from other intelligence employees who have expertise Fingar isn’t yet aware of — an analyst who served in the Peace Corps in Nigeria, or a staff member who has recently traveled there. In the traditional method of producing an intelligence estimate, Fingar said, he would call every agency and ask to borrow their Africa expert for a week or two of meetings. “And they’d say: ‘Well, I only got one guy who can spell Nigeria, and he’s traveling. So you lose.’ ” In contrast, a wiki will “change the rules of who can play,” Fingar said, since far-flung analysts and agents around the world could contribute, day or night.Yet Intellipedia also courts the many dangers of wikis — including the possibility of error. What’s to stop analysts from posting assertions that turn out to be false? Fingar admits this will undoubtedly happen. But if there are enough people looking at an entry, he says, there will always be someone to catch any grave mistakes. Rasmussen notes that though there is often strong disagreement and debate on Intellipedia, it has not yet succumbed to the sort of vandalism that often plagues Wikipedia pages, including the posting of outright lies. This is partly because, unlike with Wikipedia, Intellipedia contributors are not anonymous. Whatever an analyst writes on Intellipedia can be traced to him. “If you demonstrate you’ve got something to contribute, hey, the expectation is you’re a valued member,” Fingar said. “You demonstrate you’re an idiot, that becomes known, too.”While the C.I.A. and Fingar’s office set up their wiki, Meyerrose’s office was dabbling in the other half of Andrus’s equation. In July, his staff decided to create a test blog to collect intelligence. It would focus on spotting and predicting possible avian-flu outbreaks and function as part of a larger portal on the subject to collect information from hundreds of sources around the world, inside and outside of the intelligence agencies. Avian flu, Meyerrose reasoned, is a national-security problem uniquely suited to an online-community effort, because information about the danger is found all over the world. An agent in Southeast Asia might be the first to hear news of dangerous farming practices; a medical expert in Chicago could write a crucial paper on transmission that was never noticed by analysts.In August, one of Meyerrose’s assistants sat me down to show me a very brief glimpse of the results. In the months that it has been operational, the portal has amassed 38,000 “active” participants, though not everyone posts information. In one corner was the active-discussion area — the group blog where the participants could post their latest thoughts about avian flu and others could reply and debate. I noticed a posting, written by a university academic, on whether the H5N1 virus could actually be transmitted to humans, which had provoked a dozen comments. “See, these people would never have been talking before, and we certainly wouldn’t have heard about it if they did,” the assistant said. By September, the site had become so loaded with information and discussion that Rear Adm. Arthur Lawrence, a top official in the health department, told Meyerrose it had become the government’s most crucial resource on avian flu.The blog seemed like an awfully modest thing to me. But Meyerrose insists that the future of spying will be revolutionized as much by these small-bore projects as by billion-dollar high-tech systems. Indeed, he says that overly ambitious projects often result in expensive disasters, the way the F.B.I.’s $170 million attempt to overhaul its case-handling software died in 2005 after the software became so complex that the F.B.I. despaired of ever fixing the bugs and shelved it. In contrast, the blog software took only a day or two to get running. “We need to think big, start small and scale fast,” Meyerrose said.Moving quickly, in fact, is crucial to building up the sort of critical mass necessary to make blogs and wikis succeed. Back in 2003, a Department of Defense agency decided to train its analysts in the use of blog software, in hopes that they would begin posting about their work, read one another’s blogs and engage in productive conversations. But the agency’s officials trained only small groups of perhaps five analysts a month. After they finished their training, those analysts would go online, excited, and start their blogs. But they’d quickly realize no one else was reading their posts aside from the four other people they’d gone through the training with. They’d get bored and quit blogging, just as the next trainees came online.There was never a tipping point — “never a moment when two people who never knew each other could begin discussing something,” as Clay Shirky, a professor at New York University who was hired to consult on the project, explained to me. For the intelligence agencies to benefit from “social software,” he said, they need to persuade thousands of employees to begin blogging and creating wikis all at once. And that requires a cultural sea change: persuading analysts, who for years have survived by holding their cards tightly to their chests, to begin openly showing their hands online.Is it possible to reconcile the needs of secrecy with such a radically open model for sharing? Certainly, there would be merit in a system that lets analysts quickly locate like-minded colleagues around the world to brainstorm new ideas about how the Iraqi insurgency will evolve. But the intelligence agencies also engage in covert operations that ferret out truly incendiary secrets: the locations of Iranian nuclear facilities, say, or the name of a Qaeda leader in Pakistan. Is this the sort of information that is safe to share widely in an online network?Many in the intelligence agencies suspect not. Indeed, they often refuse to input sensitive intel into their own private, secure databases; they do not trust even their own colleagues, inside their own agencies, to keep their secrets safe. When the F.B.I. unveiled an automated case-support system in 1995, agents were supposed to begin entering all information from their continuing cases into it, so that other F.B.I. agents could benefit from the collected pool of tips. But many agents didn’t. They worried that a hard-won source might be accidentally exposed by an F.B.I. agent halfway across the country. Worse, what would happen if a hacker or criminal found access to the system?These are legitimate concerns. After the F.B.I. agent Robert Hanssen was arrested for selling the identities of undercover agents to Russia, it turned out he had found their names by trawling through records on the case-support system. As a result, many F.B.I. agents opted to keep their records on paper instead of trusting the database — even, occasionally, storing files in shoeboxes shoved under their desks. “When you have a source, you go to extraordinary lengths to protect their identities,” I. C. Smith, a 25-year veteran of the bureau, told me. “So agents never trusted the system, and rightly so.”Worse, data errors that allow information to leak can often go undetected. Five years ago, Zalmai Azmi — currently the chief information officer of the F.B.I. — was working at the Department of Justice on a data-sharing project with an intelligence agency. He requested data that the agency was supposed to have scrubbed clean of all classified info. Yet when it arrived, it contained secret information. What had gone wrong? The agency had passed it through filters that removed any document marked “secret” — but many documents were stamped “SECRET,” in uppercase, and the filter didn’t catch the difference. The next time Azmi requested documents, he found yet more secret documents inadvertently leaked. This time it was because the documents had “S E C R E T” typed with a space between each letter, and the filter wasn’t programmed to catch that either.A spy blogosphere, even carefully secured against intruders, might be fundamentally incompatible with the goal of keeping secrets. And the converse is also true: blogs and wikis are unlikely to thrive in an environment where people are guarded about sharing information. Social software doesn’t work if people aren’t social.Virtually all proponents of improved spy sharing are aware of this friction, and they have few answers. Meyerrose has already strained at boundaries that make other spies deeply uneasy. During the summer, he set up a completely open chat board on the Internet and invited anyone interested to participate in a two-week-long discussion of how to improve the spy agencies’ policies for acquiring new technology.The chat room was unencrypted and unsecured, so anyone could drop in and read the postings or mouth off. That way, Meyerrose figured, he’d be more likely to get drop-ins by engineers from small, scrappy start-up software firms who might have brilliant ideas but no other way to get an audience with intelligence chiefs. The chat room provoked howls of outrage. “People were like, ‘Hold it, can’t the Chinese and North Koreans listen in?’ ” Meyerrose told me. “And, sure, they could. But we weren’t going to be discussing state secrets. And the benefits of openness outweigh the risks.”For something like Intellipedia, though, which trafficks in genuinely serious intelligence, hard decisions had to be made about what risks were acceptable. Fingar says that deeply sensitive intel would never be allowed onto Intellipedia — particularly if it was operational information about a mission, like a planned raid on a terrorist compound. Indeed, Meyerrose’s office is building three completely separate versions of Intellipedia for each of the three levels of secrecy: Top Secret, Secret and Unclassified. Each will be placed on a data network configured so that only people with the correct level of clearance can see them — and these networks are tightly controlled, so sensitive information typed into the Top Secret Intellipedia cannot accidentally leak into the Unclassified one.But will this make the Intellipedia less useful? There are a few million government employees who could look at the relatively unsecret Intellipedia. In contrast, only a few thousand intelligence officials qualify for a Top Secret clearance, and thus will be allowed into the elite version. This presents a secrecy paradox. The Unclassified Intellipedia will have the biggest readership and thus will grow the most rapidly; but if it’s devoid of truly sensitive secrets, will it be of any use?Fingar says yes, for an interesting reason: top-secret information is becoming less useful than it used to be. “The intelligence business was initially, if not inherently, about secrets — running risks and expending a lot of money to acquire secrets,” he said, with the idea that “if you limit how many people see it, it will be more secure, and you will be able to get more of it. But that’s now appropriate for a small and shrinking percentage of information.” The time is past for analysts to act like “monastic scholars in a cave someplace,” he added, laboring for weeks or months in isolation to produce a report.Fingar says that more value can be generated by analysts sharing bits of “open source” information — the nonclassified material in the broad world, like foreign newspapers, newsletters and blogs. It used to be that on-the-ground spies were the only ones who knew what was going on in a foreign country. But now the average citizen sitting in her living room can peer into the debates, news and lives of people in Iran. “If you want to know what the terrorists’ long-term plans are, the best thing is to read their propaganda — the stuff out there on the Internet,” the W.M.D. analyst told me. “I mean, it’s not secret. They’re telling us.”Fingar and Andrus and other intelligence thinkers do not play down the importance of covert ops or high-tech satellite surveillance in intercepting specific jihadist plots. But in a world that is awash in information, it is possible, they say, that the meaning of intelligence is shifting. Beat cops in Indiana might be as likely to uncover evidence of a terror plot as undercover C.I.A. agents in Pakistan. Fiery sermons printed on pamphlets in the U.K. might be the most valuable tool in figuring out who’s raising money for a possible future London bombing. The most valuable spy system is one that can quickly assemble disparate pieces that are already lying around — information gathered by doctors, aid workers, police officers or security guards at corporations.The premise of spy-blogging is that a million connected amateurs will always be smarter than a few experts collected in an elite star chamber; that Wikipedia will always move more quickly than the Encyclopaedia Britannica; that the country’s thousand-odd political bloggers will always spot news trends more quickly than slow-moving journalists in the mainstream media. Yet one of the most successful new terrorism-busting spy organizations since 9/11 does in fact function like a star chamber. The National Counterterrorism Center was established by Congress in 2004 and charged with spotting the most important terrorism threats as they emerge. The counterterrorism center is made up of representatives from every intelligence agency — C.I.A., F.B.I., N.S.A. and others — who work together under one roof. Each analyst has access to details particular to his or her agency, and they simply share information face to face. The analysts check their personal networks for the most dire daily threats and bring them to the group. In three meetings a day, the officials assess all the intel that has risen to their attention — and they jointly decide what the nation’s most serious threats are. “We call it carbon-based integration,” said William Spalding, the center’s chief information officer.When I raised the idea of collaborative tools like blogs and wikis, Spalding and Russ Travers, one of the center’s deputy directors, were skeptical. The whole reason the center works, they said, is that experts have a top-down view that is essential to picking the important information out of the surrounding chatter. The grass roots, they’ve found, are good at collecting threats but not necessarily at analyzing them. If a lot of low-level analysts are pointing to the same inaccurate posting, that doesn’t make it any less wrong.“The key is to have very smart people culling” the daily tips, Travers told me. In October, for example, nervous rumors that a football stadium in the United States would be subject to a nuclear attack flooded the National Counterterrorism Center; analysts there immediately suspected it was spurious. “The terrorist problem has the worst signal-to-noise ratio,” Travers said. Without the knowledge that comes from long experience, he added, a fledgling analyst or spy cannot know what is important or not. The counterterrorism center, he said, should decide which threats warrant attention. “That’s our job,” he said.The Spying 2.0 vision has thus created a curious culture battle in intelligence circles. Many of the officials at the very top, like Fingar, Meyerrose and their colleagues at the office of the director of national intelligence, are intrigued by the potential of a freewheeling, smart-mobbing intelligence community. The newest, youngest analysts are in favor of it, too. The resistance comes from the “iron majors” — career officers who occupy the enormous middle bureaucracy of the spy agencies. They might find the idea of an empowered grass roots to be foolhardy; they might also worry that it threatens their turf.And the critics might turn out to be right. As Clay Shirky of N.Y.U. points out, most wikis and blogs flop. A wiki might never reach a critical mass of contributors and remain anemic until eventually everyone drifts away; many bloggers never attract any attention and, discouraged, eventually stop posting. Wikipedia passed the critical-mass plateau a year ago, but it is a rarity. “The normal case for social software is failure,” Shirky said. And because Intellipedia is now a high-profile experiment with many skeptics, its failure could permanently doom these sorts of collaborative spy endeavors.There is also the practical question of running a huge civil-service agency where you have to assess the performance of your staff. It might be difficult to measure contributions to a wiki; if a brilliant piece of analysis emerges from the mob, who gets credit for it? “A C.I.A. officer’s career is advanced by producing reports,” notes David Weinberger, a fellow at the Harvard Berkman Center for the Internet and Society, who consulted briefly with the C.I.A. on its social software. “His ability is judged by those reports. And that gets in the way of developing knowledge socially, where it becomes very difficult to know who added or revised what.”In addition, civil libertarians are alarmed by the idea of spies casually passing sensitive information around from one agency to another. “I don’t want the N.S.A. passing on information about innocent Americans to local cops in San Diego,” Weinberger said. “Those laws exist for good reasons.”In many ways, the new generation of Web-savvy spies frames the same troubling questions as the Patriot Act, which sought to break down the barriers preventing military spy agencies from conducting operations inside the United States, on American citizens, and then sharing that information with domestic groups. On a sheerly practical level, it makes sense to get rid of all barriers: why not let the N.S.A. wiretap American conversations? Vice President Cheney has argued forcefully that these historical barriers between agencies hobble the American military and intelligence forces; the Patriot Act was designed in part to eliminate them. Terrorist groups like Al Qaeda heed no such boundaries, which is precisely why they can move so quickly and nimbly.Then again, there’s a limit to how much the United States ought to emulate Al Qaeda’s modus operandi. “The problems the spies face are serious; I sympathize with that,” Shirky told me. “But they shouldn’t be wiping up every bit of information about every American citizen.” The Pentagon’s infamous Total Information Awareness program, which came to light in 2002, was intended to scoop up information on citizens from a variety of sources — commercial purchase databases, government records — and mine it for suggestive terrorism connections. But to many Americans, this sort of dot-connecting activity seemed like an outrageous violation of privacy, and soon after it was exposed, the program was killed. James X. Dempsey, director of the Center for Democracy and Technology, maintains that the laws on spying and privacy need new clarity. The historic morass of legislation, including the Patriot Act, has become too confusing, he says; both spies and the public are unsure what walls exist. While Dempsey agrees that agencies should probably be allowed to swap more information than they currently do, he says that revamped rules must also respect privacy — “otherwise, we’ll keep on producing programs that violate people’s sense of what’s right, and they’ll keep getting shut down.”For all the complaints about hardware, the challenges are only in part about technology. They are also about political will and institutional culture — and whether the spy agencies can be persuaded to change. Some former intelligence officials have expressed skepticism about whether Meyerrose and Fingar and their national-intelligence colleagues have the clout and power to persuade the agencies to adopt this new paradigm. Though D.N.I. officials say they have direct procurement authority over technology for all the agencies, there’s no evidence yet that Meyerrose will be able to make a serious impact on the eight spy agencies in the Department of Defense, which has its own annual $38 billion intelligence budget — the lion’s share of all the money the government spends on spying. When I spoke to Wilson P. Dizard III, a writer with Government Computer News who has covered federal technology issues for two decades, he said, “You have all these little barons at N.S.A. and C.I.A. and whatever, and a lot of people think they’re not going to do what the D.N.I. says, if push comes to shove.”Today’s spies exist in an age of constant information exchange, in which everyday citizens swap news, dial up satellite pictures of their houses and collaborate on distant Web sites with strangers. As John Arquilla told me, if the spies do not join the rest of the world, they risk growing to resemble the rigid, unchanging bureaucracy that they once confronted during the cold war. “Fifteen years ago we were fighting the Soviet Union,” he said. “Who knew it would be replicated today in the intelligence community?”'"
"'06-12-03,'0','Four years after writing “In C,” the composition that amounted to a minimalist manifesto, Terry Riley was playing marathon concerts by himself, using soprano saxophone and organ and tape-delay mechanisms. He recorded a number of them, and released them on LP. One, a show from March 1968 at the State University at Buffalo, billed as “Poppy Nogood and the Phantom Band: Purple Modal Fire Strobe Ecstasy,” became fairly well-known over time but dropped out of print. A new label, Elision Fields, has made it available again, the first of a projected series of discs from Mr. Riley’s archives. (The CD’s title is “Poppy Nogood and the Phantom Band: All Night Flight.”) Mr. Riley’s stamina was amazing. He improvised on saxophone and organ over cumulative tape loops, via one reel of tape and two tape recorders, one set for recording and one set for playback. The sound grows more massed, the pulses and drones bigger, more insistent and polyphonic; and though it is one unbroken piece of music, the CD track markers are set at opportune shifts of action. Here is a musician totally in charge of his material. Though he wasn’t a virtuosic saxophonist, Mr. Riley manipulated the horn cleanly within the parameters of his idea. The music is beautifully executed and, amazingly, never spreads itself too thin.Plenty of rock bands answered the siren of Mr. Riley’s pulsating minimalism in one way or another, including the Velvet Underground, the Who and Suicide. So did International Harvester, a Swedish band of the late ’60s that made the record “Sov Gott Rose-Marie.” The album was reissued a few years ago on the Swedish label Silence and has now been made domestically available via the distributor Forced Exposure. When Mr. Riley performed “In C” in Stockholm in 1967, one of the musicians in the ensemble was Bo Anders Persson, who would become the guitarist and vocalist in International Harvester. “Sov Gott Rose-Marie” and its sequel, “Hemat” — recorded a year later when the band was called simply Harvester and also now available from Forced Exposure — are far from great records. But they are great misguided exercises in trying to figure out what the European rock counterculture could make of Mr. Riley’s example.This band correctly surmised that a rock version of minimalism needed a big, dark, coordinated wallop from the rhythm section, so it did that whenever possible. It knew that boiling down folk and pop songs to their essence was a powerful, workable idea, so it did that with an old Swedish folk song, “Kuk-Polska,” and Solomon Burke’s “Everybody Needs Somebody to Love.” It incorrectly surmised, however, that the future of music was in recording outdoors. (The sound is dead on arrival.) It also suffered from putting theory ahead of practice: none of the musicians were particularly strong. Within a few years the German bands Can and Neu! would get European rock minimalism right, and International Harvester would fade away. But parts of these records are stirring and poignant enough that even their failures should be remembered.The fascinating new three-DVD package, “Kissology” (VH1 Classic Records), lines up Kiss concerts and television appearances from 1974 to 1977. What excellently upfront show-business; what a terrible band. (The musicians truly came to entertain you, but could offer only B-minus riffs, trite solos and a cement rhythm section.) Among the riches here is an appearance on “The Mike Douglas Show” in 1974, when Kiss was just beginning. Before playing “Firehouse,” Gene Simmons, in his makeup, submits to his first television interview. Straight America hasn’t seen him before.Entering the stage set, he spreads his batlike cape, sits down, brandishes his tongue, oozes his evil-sensual shtick a little, purrs that he is “evil incarnate,” and then the camera moves to the guest at his left. It is the Catskills comedian Totie Fields. She nevertheless delivers the precisely appropriate reaction. “It’d be funny if under that he was just a nice Jewish boy,” she says. There is no possible rejoinder. Mr. Simmons mumbles something and slumps a little in his chair. Then, unbelievably, Ms. Fields goes in for the kill. “You can’t hide the hook,” she says, hectoringly. She is referring to his nose. Under different circumstances, this could be a scene from Greek tragedy. (Ms. Fields found his weakness in under a minute and lanced it. It doesn’t matter that she’s a plump woman in a green print dress; she had his number and proved more streetwise.) But this is how Totie Fields and Gene Simmons — like all those who really understand popular culture — use shame, shock and anxiety as infinitely flexible material. Simmons and Fields could have taken this act on the road. “She was funny, good people,” Kiss’s Ace Frehley writes of Ms. Fields in the DVD’s accompanying notes.“It is more than a ‘jazz and poetry’ disc,” reads the news release for “So There” (XtraWatt), the new collaboration between the melodic jazz bassist Steve Swallow and the poet Robert Creeley. Those can be the scariest nine words in the English language, but, happily, here they turn out to be true. What interested Mr. Swallow most about Mr. Creeley, who died last year, before this project’s completion — was rhythm. Yet Mr. Creeley wasn’t extravagant with his verse rhythms; he only expressed what was necessary, like:Couldn’t guess it, Couldn’t be it — Wasn’t ever there then. Won’tcome back,don’t want it.'"
"'06-12-03,'0','Nine years ago, the headline on my review of Max’s was “Large Portions at Very Moderate Prices.” The same headline applies to Grillfire. The highest-priced entree is a $20 rib-eye steak with blue cheese, onion rings, salad and another side dish.Still, burgers rule this menu. The prime Angus burger ($9) was terrific, cooked medium rare as ordered and running with juices. It arrived with crisp shoestring fries, lettuce, a slice of ripe tomato, a big pickle and a choice of an add-on, like sautéed onions or bacon. We also tried the Kobe beef burger ($14); it, too, was a cooked-to-order treat, but the Angus was juicier.The po’ boy burger was also enjoyable, gilding the Angus with a topper of crunchy popcorn shrimp, a dollop of guacamole and a ramekin of rémoulade sauce. It was surf and turf on a bun.Other good entrees were the juicy turkey meatloaf with cranberry compote, the perfectly turned out grilled salmon over green beans, popcorn shrimp with two sauces (spicy and rémoulade), and sautéed chicken breast covered with sliced portobello mushrooms and artichoke hearts. All included a choice of Caesar or house salad. The latter was more appealing, with its toppers of broccoli, sweet and sour carrots, tomatoes, chickpeas and feta cheese. For $4, diners can upgrade to one of two winning choices: the George Martin chopped salad, a mix that includes roasted peppers, golden raisins and candied walnuts, or the tomato-blue cheese chopped salad, with bacon, cucumber, lettuce and red onion.Appetizers are unnecessary, given the large portions and the salad included in the entree price. We did find some good ones, though. The crab spring roll was crunchy and loaded with seafood. Also impressive were the airy buttermilk-dipped onion rings and the basket of three fries: shoestring, waffle and addictive sweet-potato fries dusted with cinnamon. There were a couple of strikeouts among the openers: dry chicken quesadillas and vegetable pot stickers (steamed dumplings), which sat in a half-inch of water.The top three desserts were a gooey molten-center chocolate cake with ice cream and a mound of whipped cream; a huge, moist brownie sundae topped with ice cream, whipped cream, tiny M & Ms and chocolate sauce (big enough for the whole table to share), and a super strawberry shortcake: warm slices of poundcake surrounded by heaps of fresh berries and drifts of whipped cream.THE CROWD Noisy and casual, lots of children.THE BAR Long and lively, with patrons lined up three deep on weekends. Thirteen moderately priced wines by the bottle ($26 to $34) or by the glass ($6.50 to $8.50).THE BILL Lunch and dinner entrees, $8 to $20; children’s entrees, $6.95.

"'06-12-03,'0','Travelers inspired by Brangelina’s postnatal charity work in Namibia take note: subsistence farmers there — and the 600 desert elephants who drink their water — need your help. In Damaraland, in the northwest area of the Namib Desert, a volunteer project is under way to build protective structures around water sources used by farmers and to create additional watering areas for the elephants.The project, called Elephant Human Relations Aid, was founded three years ago by Johannes Haasbroek, a conservationist whose efforts have already secured water sources at 35 local farms. Abenteur Afrika Safaris (www.abenteuerafrika.com) recently teamed up with the project to offer a volunteer vacation experience, which is open to anyone able-bodied and interested, and can last anywhere between two weeks and three months.“I knew that the project would be appealing to many people from all over the world, as the area we work in is incredibly beautiful, plus it gives many concerned tourists a chance to be involved in conservation work, live in nature and experience the desert elephants at close quarters,” Mr. Haasbroek said.“It’s a privilege beyond description, spending time in the desert among people brimming with passion and dedication, and getting an insider’s glimpse of these magnificent animals,” Doreen Niggles, of East Hampton N.Y., said of the experience. She has been to Namibia twice and intends to return next year.The work is not glamorous; participants are expected to set up mobile base camps, sleep in tents and bathe using buckets of water. Volunteer responsibilities — besides protecting and creating water sources — include teaching farmers new skills, and researching and tracking wild elephants (above). Rates for two-week slots start at $736.41, and include food, ground transportation and lodging.'"
"'06-12-03,'0','Even now, the 30 existing missions are in widely varying states of repair, as I found during a weeklong journey through what was once known as the Jesuit Province of Paraquaria, and the infrastructure is hardly luxurious. I managed to visit more than half of the missions, also known in Spanish as “reducciones,” or “reductions,” on a roundabout tour that ended at Iguazú Falls, where Paraguay, Brazil and Argentina meet and the most dramatic scenes in “The Mission” were filmed.QUITE quickly, I learned that all the missions — except the last to be built, in Santo Angelo in what is now Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil’s southernmost state — were laid out in identical fashion. A large church, classrooms and workshops dominated the southern side of a square, where community life was centered. The other three sides were occupied by family dwellings and by the cabildo, where the Guaraní town council, led by the chiefs, had its offices.The point in visiting as many of the missions as possible was not just to be able to see the differences in style of the various Jesuit architects — some Spanish, others Italian or German — and the Guaraní artists and craftsmen they trained. Sadly, no single mission survived intact after the expulsion of the Jesuits, meaning that to obtain a complete picture of what a mission looked like then, it is necessary to visit several of them.For instance, the mission at Jesús de Tavarangue, a few miles from my starting point in Trinidad, is the only one at which a bell tower, some 160 feet high, still stands. On a quiet Sunday morning, I climbed to the top and immediately understood that the commanding view of the rolling countryside it offered had both military and religious functions: not only to summon the faithful to Mass as often as three times a day, but also to warn residents when the bandeirantes, the dreaded slave traders from Brazil who raided the missions, were approaching.The mission that struck me as the most charming of the seven in Paraguay, though, was San Cosme y San Damián, in the far south of the country. A modern town of the same name, with 3,000 inhabitants, has grown up around the mission square. But in contrast to Encarnación, the largest town in the region, it has done so without destroying or even intruding on the church, which is still used for worship — aside from graffiti on a front wall that read “Irma, I love you, Tito.”Inside the church, I was greeted by 21 statues of saints arrayed along the side walls, including the single most arresting and peculiar religious image I saw at any mission. St. Michael the Archangel slaying Satan is a common enough sight in Latin American churches, but this was the first time I had seen the Devil portrayed as a hermaphroditic being — clearly male from the waist down and female from the waist up.Unfortunately, two other images, of St. Barbara and St. Joseph, were stolen a few years ago and never recovered. Some of the original statues are still taken out for Holy Week processsions and on the feast day of the town’s patron saints in September.“We live daily with the past here, many times without even thinking about it,” Rolando Barboza Aguilera, the site’s caretaker, told me. “There are a lot of mysteries here, a lot of questions we still can’t answer.”The church was also notable for a 17th-century chair painted with passion flowers, which is not only used by the parish priests but which Pope John Paul II sat in when he visited Paraguay in 1988. Out in the courtyard, I came across a sundial that still worked just fine, the only remnant of what once had been an astronomical observatory.“We have weeks that go by without receiving a single visitor,” Mr. Barboza said, somewhat regretfully. “What Trinidad gets in a day, we get in a month.”That is hardly surprising, because Paraguay is by some calculations the poorest nation in South America, and its backcountry is extremely relaxed and sleepy. It is the kind of place where signs on the highway warn “transit of cattle on the hoof is prohibited” and nobody pays attention.“Look at them, moving with all the leisure in the world,” Cristián Arévalo, my young guide, said when a herd casually wandered across our path and forced our car to a halt. “It seems they haven’t read the warning.”Later, at his studio on the outskirts of San Ignacio Guazú, the oldest of the missions, founded in 1609, Coqui Ruíz, a Paraguayan painter and folklorist, reflected on the bizarre Satan I had seen. His theory is that because the Guaraní word for devil, anã, is feminine, the Jesuits had to allow such a sexually ambiguous portrayal — one of several ways in which, he said, Guaraní values managed to perpetuate themselves.The original church at San Ignacio no longer stands. But the museum there offered the most varied view of Guaraní mission art, in multiple forms ranging from altarpieces to statues. St. Michael was present again, but so were St. Ignatius Loyola, St. Francis and others from the Catholic pantheon. They were all in larger-than-life dimensions meant to make them all the more imposing to the Guaraní, carved in cedar with fabulous detail and bathed in gold leaf.I also discovered a well-maintained museum and charming little hotel with an excellent library, a fine restaurant and an unusually informed, cordial and helpful owner way off the beaten track in Santa María de Fe, a quiet town of 4,000 less than an hour’s drive from San Ignacio. But the single most enjoyable site proved to be São Miguel das Missões, in southern Brazil.If there is one thing at which Brazilians excel, it is putting on a show — whether Carnival or, as is the case in São Miguel das Missões, the light and sound spectacle performed every night after dark. The 48-minute presentation on the mission grounds costs 10 reais ($4.60, at 2.2 reais to the dollar) and is in Portuguese, of course. But even for those who do not speak the language, the sounds of gunfire and hoofbeats in the night powerfully convey the constant fear of slave raiders that the Guaranís and their Jesuit protectors must have felt.The mission’s museum, designed by Lúcio Costa, one of the architects who created Brasília, was another highlight. There are 100 works of art inside, generally well-preserved wood and stone figures, some with their original colors. I was particularly impressed by a room devoted to images of female saints, including a Santa Soledade with an expression so sad and moving that it reminded me of a Modigliani painting.Outside, young Guaranís had laid out trinkets for sale, ranging from bows and arrows to ceramic bowls. When I inquired, the vendors told me they were descendants of a branch of the Guaraní that had never entered the missions and now lived in a village about 18 miles away, growing corn, yucca and sweet potatoes on 600 acres of land designated a reservation in the 1990s.The village, home to 220, is called Koenju, the Guaraní word for dawn. When I arrived, the chief, Floriano Romeu Veraxondaro, told me that outsiders are welcome so long as they call ahead to make arrangements to visit, either through him or the shaman, Nicanor Benítez; he gave me his cellphone number as a contact: (55-55) 9969-1215.“We’re happy to show you and tell you about our plants and trees, the river and the forest, but people can’t come just to satisfy their curiosity,” Mr. Romeu said in accented Portuguese. “They have to help us and leave something behind. It doesn’t have to be a lot, but they have to buy something.”The Guaranís’ mastery of Western classical music faded away long ago, of course, and survives only on sheet music discovered recently in Bolivia. But after hearing Mr. Romeu and his son Anildo perform some traditional Guaraní songs on a five-string guitar and a three-string violin, I ended up buying a CD recorded by the village’s orchestra and choir — which, he proudly told me, are scheduled to go on tour to Peru and Italy next year.The government of Rio Grande do Sul state has also set up what it calls the Missions Route to encourage visits to other nearby missions and shrines, some of them modern, like one honoring the Virgin of Czestochowa. This part of Brazil is a region of fertile fields settled by German, Italian and Polish immigrants a century or so ago, and it is possible to traverse the route on foot, bicycle and even horseback, on tours of up to a week arranged by local travel agencies.But it was at Caaró, about a dozen miles from São Miguel, that I found the most compelling proof that the memory of missions continues to influence popular faith in the region. Next to a small church, a monument topped by a cross honors three priests who were killed by native allies of the bandeirantes on Nov. 16, 1626. One of the victims, Roque González de Santa Cruz, was canonized in 1931 and is venerated throughout the region.Past this cenotaph, a couple of hundred yards down a shaded path called the Trail of the Martyred Saints, I found a small fountain and a bubbling spring. Pilgrims come all year from Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay to drink or bottle the water, which is believed to have miraculous healing powers and is credited with curing the diseases of several of St. Roque’s followers.A snack bar is nearby, and there, selling ice cream and soft drinks behind the counter, I found the priest who is the caretaker of the sanctuary, the Rev. Nelmo Roque ten Kathen. He looked somewhat wilted by the blazing mid-afternoon heat, but urged me to try to come back on the third Sunday in November, when the pilgrimages reach their peak.“The anniversary of the martyrdom is really something to see,” he said. “The number of people coming varies from year to year, depending on whether the priests at the church where St. Roque is buried allow his heart to be brought from Asunción. Some years they do, and some years they don’t.”It became clear that each of the three countries has a different relationship with its past. Guaraní is, in fact, both the name of Paraguay’s currency and an official language there on equal footing with Spanish. Thus the missions are central to the country’s identity: “ñanaemba’e teete,” or “truly ours,” as Paraguayans say in Guaraní.But in Argentina, “ruins,” rather than “missions,” was the preferred terminology, accurately reflecting the generally sad state of things. The province called Misiones is nearly 1,000 miles from Buenos Aires and has stands of what Argentines call “selva,” or “jungle,” a categorization that seemed rather exaggerated to me and meant to justify the neglect I found.THE instant I arrived at San Ignacio Miní, the best preserved of the Argentina missions, it was clear that I was in for an experience completely unlike that of Paraguay. San Ignacio was ringed with tour buses galore, outdoor restaurants offering blue plate specials and kiosks selling tacky souvenirs and trinkets said to be in Guaraní style. As I parked my car, would-be guides and car monitors came running my way.It was hardly an auspicious start, but once I got onto the mission grounds themselves, the situation improved. A nifty mock-up of the mission as it would have looked shortly after its founding in 1633 stood at the center of a small museum, and I was able to join a group of Canadians for a tour led by a multilingual guide who moved easily among Spanish, English and French.Though exactly half the 30 missions are in Argentine territory, only San Ignacio has undergone a real restoration, and the two museums I visited in Posadas, the provincial capital, were a disappointment compared with those I had seen in Paraguay and Brazil. At Candelaria, where the Jesuits had their provincial headquarters, only a few walls within sight of the Paraná River remain — and those are on the grounds of a prison, whose permission is required before the ruins can be visited.Still, I found a visit to the Mission of Our Lady of Loreto, a dozen miles from San Ignacio Miní, to be instructive, though in a very melancholy way. In its heyday in the early 1700s, this was the largest of the missions, with more than 7,000 residents, and was also the site of a pilgrimage to a nearby hill called Calvary that drew as many as 100,000 Guaraní believers.“The first printing press to be built in all of South America was at Loreto and began publishing Bibles and catechisms in Guaraní in 1700, 60 years before there was a printing press in Buenos Aires,” Marcelo Sánchez, the caretaker of the mission, told me. “At that time, Loreto was also the principal producer of yerba mate tea, which was sold as far away as Mexico.”Today, though, the site is overgrown with vines and trees and the mood is one of desolation and abandonment. Where the Guaraní graveyard once stood, the colonists who settled the area in the late 19th century, with names like Nielsen and Sato, have built a cemetery of their own.With no other company but that of Mr. Sanchez and only the cawing of a few birds to break the silence, I was able to contemplate how ephemeral mankind’s achievements can be.“This place has a bizarre energy, doesn’t it?” he asked me.No airline flies from the United States directly to Encarnación or Posadas, the twin cities on opposite sides of the Paraná River in the heart of mission country. The best way to reach the region is probably via São Paulo in Brazil, which has multiple daily flights to Foz do Iguaçu, on the Brazilian side of the Iguazú Falls. A recent Web search for flights in early January, during the South American summer, found a best round-trip fare from New York of $805 on TAM Linhas Aereas.An alternative is to fly to Buenos Aires (American and Aero Lineas Argentinas fly nonstop from the New York area, starting around $1,060 round trip) and then on to Posadas, capital of Argentina’s Misiones province, or to Puerto Iguazú on the Argentine side of the falls. Also, from about $1,000, there are daily flights from Miami to Asunción, the capital of Paraguay, from which it is possible to reach Encarnación, 225 miles away, by bus, car or plane.Originally, my plan was a simple one: rent a car and drive it in all three countries. But I soon discovered that rental agencies in Argentina and Brazil will not allow you to drive their cars into Paraguay, where even a former president was detected driving a stolen car. And Encarnación, the largest city in the Paraguayan mission area, has no car rental agencies. So I paid extra to have a car driven there from Asunción.In Argentina, daily rental rates run about 200 pesos (about $65 at 3 pesos to the U.S. dollar) with 200 free miles thrown in. But crossing the border into Brazil and then back again proved frustrating: the only convenient way to cross the Uruguay River is on a ferry, which runs three to five times a day, depending on the day of the week.The best solution, then, is probably to book a package tour through a travel agency, traveling by bus in all three countries. In Santo Angelo, Brazil, try Italiatur (55-55-3312-5163 or 55-55-9962-3806, www.italiaturmissoes.com.br) or Golden Travel (55-55-3314-2773, www.goldentravel.com.br). In São Miguel das Missões, Brazil, Missões Turismo (55-55-3381-1319, www.missoesturismo.com.br) is used to dealing with foreign visitors.All of these agencies can also handle arrangements for hiking, bicycle or horseback tours of the mission route.To enter both Brazil and Paraguay, Americans need visas, obtainable at consulates in the United States.While luxury accommodations are available at Iguazú Falls on both the Brazilian and Argentine sides, nothing in the missions region itself qualifies for that category. Even chain hotels are hard to find, other than the Novotel on the outskirts of Encarnación, (595-71-204-131 or 595-71-207-2640).Elsewhere, lodgings tend to be simple, adequate and cheap. The Hotel Papillon, near the Trinidad and Jesús de Tavarangue missions in Hohenau, Paraguay (595-71-235-280, www.papillon.com.py), for instance, has comfortable rooms for about 150,000 guaranís (about $26 at 5,765 guaranís to the dollar), breakfast included.The most unexpected and pleasant surprise of my trip was the brand new Santa María Hotel on the main square in Santa María de Fe, Paraguay (595-781-283-311; www.santamariahotel.org). Margaret Hebblethwaite, the very helpful expatriate Englishwoman who runs it, called it an experiment in “ethical tourism.” Payment is in cash only, but the rooms cost just $20 a night.In Posadas, Argentina, the four-star Hotel Julio Cesar is downtown (1951, Calle Entreríos; 54-375-427-930) and has Wi-Fi service in the lobby and restaurant. The 100 rooms go for 100 pesos.Across the border in Brazil, São Miguel das Missões offers two options. The Wilson Park Hotel (55-55-3381-2000, www.wilsonparkhotel.com.br), is the more luxurious choice., It has 78 rooms, with doubles from 135 reais (about $61 at 2.2 reais to the dollar).But the Pousada das Missões (55-55-3381-1202, www.pousadatematica.com.br) is barely 100 yards from the mission. It has 27 rooms for about 80 reais a night, and a wing that serves as a hostel for backpackers (29 reais a person, with a Hostel International card).'"
"'06-12-03,'0','By Big East Conference successes and standards, would it be that much of a reach to say that Rodriguez is Jeter and Schiano is, well, Rodriguez? Although West Virginia was already out of the B.C.S. picture, high definition wasn’t necessary to sharply contrast the overall coaching achievements, beginning with the fact that Schiano began the night with a six-year Rutgers record of 29-40, compared with Rodriguez’s 48-24 mark over the same span.No question Schiano deserves great praise for bringing Rutgers this far, for the 10 victories, the Louisville conquest, cracking the top 10 and removing the scarlet-letter subtext from the R in Rutgers. No question the athletic director, Bob Mulcahy, was correct in his assessment that Schiano, a New Jersey native with no head-coaching experience, was the right man for a major construction job.One that remains in progress, assuming Schiano isn’t another raspy preacher of patience who can’t exercise restraint with mercenary money staring him in the face for the first time.On the subject of Miami and its reported craving to have Schiano return to where he served as defensive coordinator, can the geniuses who dole out the guaranteed millions even tell the difference between a coach whose program has consistently been cooking and another who is piping-hot out of the microwave?That, right now, is what separates Schiano and Rodriguez, who began this season defending three successive Big East titles and whose team was on a run of three straight January bowl games, including last season’s 38-35 upset of Georgia in the Sugar Bowl.Yes, there’s the argument that Schiano inherited a program that was not only in tatters but also lacked essentials like a serious Division I-A infrastructure and bases in recruiting and fan support. And granted, Morgantown is the kind of all-consuming townie environment athletic directors and coaches are born dreaming of.But Rodriguez didn’t find the Four Horsemen waiting for him here in 2001, when he debuted at 3-8. By 2002, his team was 9-4. He hasn’t had close to a losing season since and is considered one of the true innovators with his acclaimed spread offense, which last night had to do without the sophomore quarterback Pat White.Inserted in his place was a red-shirt freshman, Jarrett Brown, and the Mountaineers still rang up 439 yards.“A difficult offense,” Schiano said, especially because “you’re dealing with the inventor of it.”Here in Morgantown, nobody will cheer if Rodriguez takes the elevator up one or two stops to a higher income bracket at Alabama. On Friday he countered the rumors by saying he planned to be West Virginia coach for the rest of his career. These plans have been known to change, but given Rodriguez’s half-decade of excellence, can he legitimately be flagged for a false start if he decides to go?Carefully worded declarations of fidelity notwithstanding, Schiano’s employment future remains under review, along with his legacy.“There have been enough good things the last 18 months to get people excited,” he said.Not enough — with the Texas Bowl beckoning instead of the Orange, on the sparsely watched NFL Network on Dec. 28 — to claim his mission anywhere near complete.His program announced itself this year and, even in defeat, made a statement last night. It just missed crashing the Bowl Championship Series with crestfallen Southern California and all the others.“This is where it starts,” said Rice, the intended receiver on the end-game conversion attempt. “I can say I played in a tough Big East championship game going into next year.”Will the coach be with him? Rice said, “I don’t get involved in those decisions,” but maybe between here and Texas, Schiano the savior will tell Miami to lose his number, and remember that sainthood is conferred on those who not only soar but who stay.'"

The American Express campaign features an avatar of Ms. DeGeneres, for instance, while Doggie-Mail has three talking dogs: a Boston terrier, a bulldog and what Purina calls an ""all-American"" breed, which closely resembles a mutt.The avatars, and the ability of consumers to create content as well as look at it, are intended to woo consumers into spending more time on the sponsored Web sites than they otherwise may. They are also meant to help consumers enjoy their experiences, so they do not come away thinking they were wasting time looking at advertising.""Petcentric’s main objective is to elevate the image of the Purina brand and raise awareness of our products and promotions,"" says Andres Piacentino, director for consumer relationship marketing at Nestlé Purina Pet Care in St. Louis.""We’ve been doing e-mail marketing for five, six years, but this is our first time doing something as interactive as this,"" he adds. ""We’re using the new features and functionalities technology can offer to communicate the emotional message of our brands to consumers.""Purina sends Petcentric e-mail messages to about 2 million consumers each month, Mr. Piacentino says, and the company updates the Web site every month.Consumers are invited to send comments as well as upload photos and video clips, the better to make petcentric.com into ""an online entertainment community for pet owners,"" he adds.Tom Faulkner, group account director at CheckMark, says the inspiration for Doggie-Mail grew from discussions about ""how can we engage pet owners in a new way,"" centered on the idea that ""pets are fun, pets are about giving love and receiving love.""""Doggie-Mail is a fun way for them to interact with each other and with Purina,"" he adds. The team at CheckMark that came up with the concept was Dalynn Spillars and Renee Walsh.Doggie-Mail was introduced two weeks ago, in e-mail messages to the Petcentric mailing list that were labeled ""Doggie-Mail from Petcentric, brought to you by Purina.""The messages directed the consumers to petcentric.com to ""create your own Doggie-Mail fun"" and ""put words in the mouths of our talking dogs, then e-mail your messages to friends and family.""The visitors to petcentric.com get to choose from among the three dogs as well as from wardrobes, props and scenes. They can have the dog speak a prerecorded message or type in a line of dialogue and select a voice to speak it.Or the visitors can call a toll-free telephone number and record messages in their own voices.""The big brands are starting to embrace more and more viral marketing and user-generated content,"" says Adi Sideman, president and chief executive at Oddcast.One reason is that ""the open rates are very, very low"" for e-mail messages that come from advertisers, he adds, ""but if you’re getting e-mail from a friend, it’s very personal, and that’s something consumers have an affinity for.""For some of the interactive e-mail applications designed by Oddcast, Mr. Sideman says, ""the open rates are 70 percent and there are tremendous pass-along rates, like 30 percent.""""When one out of three people who get it pass it on, that causes what we call a viral outbreak,"" he adds.A benefit for the sponsor, Mr. Sideman says, is that such outbreaks tend to last a long time.For example, Monk-e-Mail was introduced in February by CareerBuilder, after a Super Bowl campaign featuring chimpanzees. Since then, there have been a total of 10.1 million unique visitors to the special e-mail Web site (careerbuilder.com/monk-e-mail) and they have sent 70 million messages.""We’re delighted to see it raging with traffic months later,"" Mr. Sideman says.The Doggie-Mail campaign started on Nov. 20 and three days later was featured in vignettes during the NBC broadcast of ""The National Dog Show Presented by Purina."" Doggie-Mail was promoted by John O’Hurley, a co-host of the show, who is also taking part in a sweepstakes.Computer users who send Doggie-Mail messages can enter the sweepstakes, with prizes that include copies of Mr. O’Hurley’s new book, ""It’s Okay to Miss the Bed on the First Jump: And Other Life Lessons I Learned from Dogs"" (Hudson Street Press).Since the dog show, says Mr. Piacentino of Nestlé Purina Pet Care, the company has already ""seen a lot of growth in Web site visits"" to petcentric.com, up about 40 percent on average, he adds, with page views ""up about 150 percent versus the average, to about 1 million.""And Mr. Faulkner of CheckMark says that Purina intends periodic updates of Doggie-Mail to keep it fresh, ""at least quarterly but maybe more.""If you like In Advertising, be sure to read the Advertising column that appears Monday through Friday in the Business Day section of The New York Times newspaper.'"

"'06-12-04,'1','Because the torcetrapib-related deaths occurred during a clinical trial, before the drug reached the market, Pfizer will not face the product liability lawsuits that have dogged Merck over its painkiller, Vioxx. Merck withdrew Vioxx, a best-selling arthritis drug, after evidence emerged that it could cause heart strokes and heart attacks. Patients in clinical trials must sign waivers confirming that they understand the risks they face when they take unapproved medicines in clinical trials.Scientists had seen torcetrapib as the vanguard of a new wave of medicines that would give physicians new ways to reduce heart disease by raising good cholesterol, following the success of medicines called statins, drugs like Lipitor that work by inhibiting the production of so-called bad cholesterol. These drugs, which include Pfizer’s Lipitor, are among the best-selling drugs in the world with tens of billions of dollars in annual sales.Now Pfizer, and independent cardiologists, must determine whether torcetrapib’s failure indicates that all medicines to raise good cholesterol will have similar problems, or if the problem was specifically related to some defect in torcetrapib.Pfizer had been three years into a late-phase clinical trial of torcetrapib involving 15,000 patients when Dr. LaMattina, the Pfizer scientist, fielded the call early on Saturday. Dr. Steven W. Ryder, a senior Pfizer scientist overseeing the development of the company’s most important experimental medicine, told Dr. LaMattina that the independent researchers monitoring the torcetrapib trial — who were the only ones privy to the results — had called Friday evening to recommend that it be halted.The independent monitors called regularly on the first of each month to give a progress report. This time, however, the results stacked up irretrievably against the drug’s safety, and the monitors had determined that the numbers could not possibly reverse themselves in torcetrapib’s favor.Not only were there 31 more deaths among the people taking torcetrapib, but similar discrepancies were seen in the number of patients suffering heart failure and other problems, giving the company no choice but to stop development.Dr. LaMattina quickly called Jeffrey B. Kindler, Pfizer’s chief executive, to tell him that the researchers thought the trial should be stopped. By 8 a.m., Pfizer’s senior leaders were talking over the results on a conference call.Less than three hours later, the executives decided to stop the trial. By Saturday afternoon, the company began to notify the 100 hospitals and medical clinics on three continents that were running it. That night Pfizer put out a press release announcing the news.For Pfizer, torcetrapib represented a potential blockbuster medicine that could generate several billion dollars in sales annually. Those revenues are crucial for Pfizer, which is fighting to keep its revenues from declining as it loses patent protection on best-selling drugs such as Zoloft, an anti-depressant, and Zithromax, an antibiotic.The problem comes at an especially bad time for the company, whose new chief executive, Mr. Kindler, heavily promoted torcetrapib’s prospects, most recently on Thursday at a conference for investors that Pfizer hosted at its giant research center in Groton, Conn.Pfizer shares, which have been among the worst-performing of any major drug company over the last five years, will probably open sharply lower today.Pfizer, which has 106,000 employees and about $50 billion in annual sales, is still highly profitable, but it will lose patent protection on its best-selling drugs over the next five years. And despite a $7 billion annual research budget its near-term pipeline of new drugs is nearly empty.Pfizer’s decision to abandon torcetrapib throws into question the theory that using drugs to raise good cholesterol, known as HDL, will benefit patients. Some scientists worry that the drugs cause the body to produce a form of HDL that may actually be harmful.The problem, though, could be specifically related to a defect in torcetrapib, which is known to raise blood pressure, a serious side effect for a heart medicine. Other experimental drugs that raise good cholesterol, including two in very early stage clinical development from Pfizer and another from Roche, do not seem to have similar effects.As is customary, Pfizer had hired a board of independent scientists to monitor the torcetrapib trial, which had been scheduled to end in 2009. The trial, called Illuminate, compared 7,500 patients taking a combination of torcetrapib and Lipitor, Pfizer’s best-selling statin, with a similar number of patients taking only Lipitor. The patients had diabetes or cardiovascular disease, making them more likely to have heart attacks or strokes than the general population.Each month, the independent scientists reviewed data from the trial comparing the effects of the two treatments. To protect the trial’s integrity, people inside Pfizer were not allowed to see the data.Pfizer had hoped the trial would show that people taking the combination pill would be significantly less likely to suffer deaths or heart problems than those taking Lipitor alone. Instead, it showed the opposite.The Food and Drug Administration said it endorsed Pfizer’s decision to end the trial and believed the company had acted properly. Torcetrapib’s failure is disappointing, but developing new drugs is risky and difficult, said Dr. Robert Meyer, director of the agency’s office of drug evaluation.“Research is research,” Dr. Meyer said. “If you knew the answer, you wouldn’t be doing it.”The discontinuation of torcetrapib is the second major failure in the Pfizer’s development program in less than a week. On Tuesday, Pfizer said it would no longer collaborate with Akzo Nobel, a European company, on asenapine, a drug for schizophrenia.Finding new medicines is crucial for Pfizer, which in 2004 began to lose monopoly protection on several of its best-selling drugs, opening them to cheap generic competition. In 2010, Pfizer faces the loss of patent protection on Lipitor, the world’s top-selling medicine, with $13 billion in annual sales.Michael Krensavage, an analyst at Raymond James, a financial services firm, said that torcetrapib’s failure would force Pfizer to accelerate its plans to lay off employees and reduce costs. “More job cuts are on the way,” he said.Mr. Kindler said he was surprised and disappointed at the findings. Torcetrapib’s failure highlights the risks that drug makers face as they try to develop new and important medicines, he said in a telephone interview yesterday. “This is a very high-risk business,” he said.Still, the company is financially strong and expects to report higher profit in both 2007 and 2008, mainly due to cost-cutting, Mr. Kindler said.Dr. Meyer of the F.D.A. said that torcetrapib’s failure did not mean that similar medicines under developed should be abandoned.“If another drug raised HDL but didn’t affect blood pressure, that might be suitable,” Dr Meyer said. “The finding certainly raises concerns and would make everybody appropriately cautious, but it’s not enough to say this class is at a dead end.”'"
"'06-12-04,'1','Players were surprisingly upbeat Saturday night, even after they lost to West Virginia, 41-39.They now have about three weeks to reflect on one play, the 2-point conversion that crumbled. Rutgers set up with an empty backfield. Quarterback Mike Teel rolled to his right. Two receivers complained that they were held. The pass fell in the end zone.Schiano said the team worked on a few different 2-point plays during the week, but he did not even consider using the others.“This was the top one by far,” he said. “The play was conceptually a very good play. Some things that go on during the play are questionable.”Asked if he thought a holding penalty should have been called, Schiano said: “The look on my face was anger because I saw it as it happened.”Now the Miami coaching search can seriously begin. If the Hurricanes are going to pursue Schiano, as expected, they will probably contact him this week.Schiano spoke about the Miami job in only the most general terms yesterday. “Any school that has that kind of tradition and history is something that to the right person is attractive,” he said.Although Schiano acknowledged that he was disappointed in Saturday’s loss, he can take solace knowing that Louisville lost at West Virginia last season in a similar way.The Cardinals also scored a tying touchdown in the third overtime, and also failed to make a 2-point conversion, losing the Big East title as a result. Louisville won the Big East this season by virtue of Rutgers’s missed conversion.“It’s crazy,” Rutgers safety Courtney Greene said. “Last year, Louisville was even in the same locker room.”PATERNO PLANS TO STAY Joe Paterno, whose 80th birthday is Dec. 21, said yesterday that he planned to coach Penn State from the sideline against Tennessee in the Outback Bowl on Jan. 1 and that he expected to return next season, which would be his 42nd.Paterno’s left knee was seriously damaged in a collision on the sideline a month ago at Wisconsin.

"'06-12-04,'1','MOSCOW, Dec. 3 — While Marat Safin and the rest of Russia’s Davis Cup team were holding hands and bowing to the crowd inside the Olympic Stadium, José Acasuso of Argentina was crying in his chair as his teammates huddled close and tried to make the best of a difficult situation.After Argentina tied the Davis Cup final at 2-2 with a victory in the first match Sunday, it needed only a victory by Acasuso, ranked 27th in the world, to secure the title. Argentina was looking for its first championship since it began playing Davis Cup in 1921. It had played in only one other final, in 1981.Acasuso, with his big serve working, produced plenty of trouble for the more celebrated Safin, who is ranked 26th. What Acasuso could not produce was the shot he needed most.He slugged a short forehand into the net on match point with Safin ahead by 6-5 in the tie breaker in the fourth set, giving Safin a 6-3, 3-6, 6-3, 7-6 (5) victory.Acasuso put a hand on his face and staggered forward for the handshake. But Safin took quite a while to reach the net; he was engulfed by Russians intent on celebrating their country’s second Davis Cup victory but its first at home. If Safin were not 6 feet 4 inches and 195 pounds, his teammates would certainly have thrown him into the air for quite a while longer.'"

"'06-12-04,'1','Commission members say they concluded that Mr. Bush’s strategy so far has created an expectation that the United States will always be there to hold Iraq together. Breaking that culture of dependency, they concluded, is the key to making the long-discussed “Iraqification” of the country’s security a reality. But they are uncertain whether they can persuade a famously stubborn president to adopt that view.“Is George Bush ready to hear that?” one commission member asked over the weekend. “I don’t think any of us really know. I don’t know if the president himself knows.”The answer may depend on the impact of the bruising political realities of 2006 — and the prospect that Iraq could define Mr. Bush’s presidency as Vietnam defined Lyndon B. Johnson’s.Mr. Bush, of course, has never lacked for certainty about his strategies for Iraq. From his early enthusiastic descriptions about building a model of democracy in the Middle East to his glossy “Victory in Iraq” strategy paper a year ago, Mr. Bush has not shown a hint of doubt in public that eventually his approach would succeed, or that his critics were wildly off course.That has begun to change just days before the Iraq Study Group’s report, which includes a call for phased withdrawal of combat brigades from Iraq, starting next year and ending in 2008. Now Mr. Bush and his aides are suddenly trying to embrace uncertainty as a virtue — a sign of flexibility toward new ideas.A flood of memos written by Mr. Bush’s top advisers — two of them leaked in recent days — offer a host of ideas, some of them internally inconsistent and some proposing actions dismissed by Mr. Bush just months ago as evidence of a lack of national resolve to win.On Sunday, Mr. Hadley’s repetition of the wording “way forward” was no accident. Both the title of the Iraq Study Group’s report and the proposed name of the yet-undecided White House strategy are expected to make use of the same language, officials say.Mr. Hadley portrayed Mr. Bush as “interested in getting a range of new ideas” for many months now — a period that covers the run-up to the midterm elections, when he and Vice President Dick Cheney charged that “phased withdrawal” and timelines were just euphemisms for retreat.Perhaps so. But Mr. Bush himself told Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki on Friday that “this business about graceful exit just simply has no realism to it,” a statement that made some commission members wonder if the president was signaling that some of their ideas would be dead on arrival.Mr. Hadley offered a different explanation on Sunday, saying on NBC’s “Meet the Press” that after the first leaks of the Iraq Study Group’s conclusions, the president simply felt “he needed to stop” any talk that the commission, led by James A. Baker III and Lee H. Hamilton, was going to provide “cover for an American withdrawal.”“That’s cut and run and, of course, as the president has said, cut and run is not his cup of tea,” Mr. Hadley said.But commission members say it is not tea they will be serving on Wednesday, but rather a more powerful brew, infused with the realities of a war on the brink of spinning beyond Washington’s control. They insist that their phased approach of incentives and disincentives to Mr. Maliki’s government amounts to a last-ditch effort to come up with a strategy with a prayer of working, and that if it was compressed onto a bumper sticker, it would boil down to “train and walk backward.”Administration officials say Mr. Bush is likely to embrace that part of the report, which will call for vastly increasing the number of American trainers embedded in Iraqi units, along with other provisions that he can argue are already being implemented.And while the White House will call for time to examine the rest of the report, officials say that Mr. Baker, who was secretary of state under Mr. Bush’s father and is close to the current president, has kept Mr. Hadley and others apprised of the broad directions of the report.“There’s been more than a little common shaping of concepts here, and I suspect you’ll hear that in some of the language used by all sides,” said one commission official working on the report.The risk, commission members say, is that by the time the White House carries out its “new way forward,” it may be too late. Gen. George W. Casey Jr., the commander of American forces in Iraq, drafted plans early this year to reduce the number of American combat brigades by a third by the end of this year. That has not happened; instead, the brigades are facing more danger than ever as they try to regain control of Baghdad.Even Mr. Hadley seemed barely able to suppress his skepticism at Mr. Maliki’s vow, renewed last week, that Iraq’s military would be able to defend the government itself by the middle of 2007. “Our commanders have looked at that plan; they think it is ambitious,” he said.'"

"'06-12-05,'1','ORLANDO, Fla., Dec. 4 -- The Mets met in Orlando last night with Scott Boras, the agent for pitcher Barry Zito, and they were no doubt given a binder crammed with data detailing Zito’s value. But no matter how many persuasive statistics Boras supplies the Mets, the only number that ultimately matters is the one the Mets offer him.With reports suggesting that the Texas Rangers are willing to offer $100 million or more over six years, it is highly unlikely that the Mets would match such a figure. They are reluctant to go longer than five years and will not submit to the escalating market.“I can’t worry about what other teams are doing,” Minaya said.It is doubtful that Zito will sign this week, unless Boras and Zito are bowled over by a figure. The real question for the Mets is whether Zito would snatch a more lucrative offer to play in a place like Texas’ Ameriquest Field, a notorious hitters haven, and for a lesser team, or take less money to play for his former pitching coach, Rick Peterson, in New York.The Mets have options if they lose Zito. With Vicente Padilla poised to re-sign with the Rangers, the Mets’ primary alternative through free agency is Mark Mulder. He is recovering from shoulder surgery and probably will not be ready by opening day, but he would be worth taking a chance on if the Mets could find a front-line starter in a trade.Minaya said it was too early to tell whether he could swing a trade this week, but he has compiled a “wish list” of pitchers. The Mets have inquired about the Rangers’ surplus of relievers, remain interested in the White Sox’ Freddy García and Javier Vázquez, and have also looked at Mark Buehrle.Buehrle, who is 10 months younger than Zito, went 12-13 with a 4.99 earned run average last season but has won 16 or more games four times in seven seasons. He will become a free agent after next season, however, and it is doubtful that the Mets would mortgage a prospect like Lastings Milledge without being granted a window to negotiate an extension.'"

"'06-12-05,'1','Right now, all these flaws seem to be making house values look much stronger than they really are. According to the latest index, for example, the average house in Miami would have sold for 22 percent more this summer than a year earlier. You won't find many house sellers in Miami who would agree that's true.As Thomas Lawler, a housing economist (and no relation to Patrick Lawler), recently wrote in a report to clients, ""Well, there's a growing view that this index...doesn't reflect what's really going on with home prices.""Mr. Lawler of Ofheo disputes that. He acknowledges that the index has fewer high-priced houses than the market as a whole but says that it still picks up many expensive homes, because they often have mortgages worth much less than the house's value. He also pointed out that the Ofheo data covers only single-family homes, not condominiums (which in many markets are doing worse than houses).More broadly, Mr. Lawler says that the Ofheo index is based on an enormous amount of data that is more accurate than any individual perceptions of a local real-estate market. ""The indexes,"" he said, referring to Ofheo's measure and others, ""all do a good job of measuring what they're designed for.""My sense, though, is that the blind spots in the Ofheo index are big enough to make a real difference. In fact, the index now appears to be less accurate than the numbers reported by the National Association of Realtors, which are actually calculated in a less sophisticated way.The Realtors don't track individual houses over time. They simply look at the houses that happened to sell during a given quarter and calculate their median price. So these numbers are even more strongly influenced by the mix of homes being sold.If a group of mansions is suddenly built in a city, they will artificially make all house prices there appear to be rising. Or if the houses that are sold one quarter have lost less of their value than the typical house, which seems to be happening now, the Realtors' data will make house prices look healthier than they truly are. Yet despite this bias, the price drop in some markets has become big enough that even the Realtors have been reporting small declines in south Florida, Boston, Washington and parts of California, among other places.Unfortunately, there is no easy fix to some of these problems. Robert Shiller, a Yale economist who has been a pioneer in developing house-price indexes, agrees that the mix of houses being sold can affect the numbers. ""When the market drops, people who bought near the peak are slower to sell than people who bought when prices were lower than they are today,"" Mr. Shiller wrote in an e-mail. ""This means that some sales do not occur because people are holding out, and in this sense the indices are biased.""But it's not clear what economists can do about this bias. They can't measure sales that aren't happening. They can't, in other words, tell you what your house would sell for if you decided you had to sell it this month. In their own index — which are also offering a pretty rosy view — Mr. Shiller and his colleagues have opted not to adjust their numbers, since any corrections ""would be ad-hoc corrections that would not be objective.""For homeowners, the lesson is not to take any of these statistics too personally. The long housing boom has caused a lot of Americans to think of housing much as they think of stocks — as an investment whose value can be tracked almost in real time. But there is no equivalent of the Standard & Poor 500 Index for real estate. Just because the government's measure shows a 10 percent increase in your area's home prices doesn't mean that your house is 10 percent more valuable than it was a year ago. It might, in truth, be less valuable than it was a year ago.'"
"'06-12-05,'1','TEHRAN, Dec. 5 — Iran will hold a two-day conference on the Holocaust next week in which more than 60 scholars from some 30 countries will participate, the Foreign Ministry said today.The seminar is in response to President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad’s comments last year, when he said the scale of the genocide of the Jews had been exaggerated, the deputy foreign minister, Manouchehr Mohammadi, told a news conference today. Mr. Ahmadinejad first stirred outrage in the West in December last year, when he called the Holocaust a myth. He has repeatedly said that the Holocaust has been used as a tool of propaganda, and banned scholars here from research on the subject. The president also sent a 3,000-word letter to Germany’s Chancellor Angela Merkel outlining his arguments.Mr. Mohammadi said next week’s conference will “provide the opportunity for scholars from both sides to give their papers in freedom and without pre-conceived ideas.” He refused to give the names of the 67 international scholars he said were attending the seminar, out of concern that their countries would prohibit them from coming.He said the conference does not mean that Iran “denies the crimes of Hitler.”“Since we are not accused and responsible for the Holocaust, we are an impartial judge,” Mr. Mohammadi said.The conference, sponsored by the Foreign Ministry’s Institute for Political and International Studies (known as IPIS), will be held on Dec. 11 and 12.'"
"'06-12-05,'1','Officials of the corporation that runs the Taco Bell chain said that its restaurants had reopened today, despite an outbreak of apparently food-borne infection that sickened at least 39 people in central New Jersey and on Long Island.Speaking to an investor conference in New York, Tom Jerzyk, a vice president of the parent company, Yum Brands, said, “We expect all Taco Bell restaurants to be back in operation today.”He said the company had worked with health officials to clean and re-stock the affected restaurants — eight on Long Island and one in South Plainfield, N.J. — and said “there is no immediate threat to customers today,” even though the specific source of the contamination has not been definitely determined.New Jersey’s top health official seemed to agree that whatever it was that infected the 39 people with E. coli, a common bacterium that can cause moderate to serious illness if ingested, the contaminant now appears to be out of the Taco Bell system.“There has not been an outbreak since Nov. 29, so I think that whatever happened went through already,” the state health commissioner, Fred M. Jacobs, told The Associated Press on Monday.'"
"'06-12-05,'1','“I think that military action against Iran would be an absolute last resort,” Mr. Gates said. “I think that we have seen in Iraq that once war is unleashed, it becomes unpredictable. And I think that the consequences of a conflict — a military conflict with Iran could be quite dramatic. And therefore, I would counsel against military action, except as a last resort,” he added.Mr. Gates said that he opposed an attack on Syria, which the Bush administration has criticized, along with Iran, for contributing to the instability in Iraq.Mr. Gates’s most direct statements about Iraq came during exchanges with Senators Carl Levin, the Michigan Democrat who is soon to take over as the panel’s chairman, and John McCain of Arizona, who will become the top-ranking Republican.“Do you believe that we are currently winning in Iraq?” asked Mr. Levin, who has pushed for announcing a date to begin withdrawals of American troops from Iraq. “No, sir,” Mr. Gates replied, adding that he did not believe the United States was losing, either.As recently as October, Mr. Bush had said that “absolutely, we’re winning” in Iraq, though he also made clear he was dissatisfied with the pace of progress there. But Senator John Warner, the Virginia Republican, noted that General Peter Pace, the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, had used a formulation at a policy forum in Washington on Monday that was much like the one that Mr. Gates used in his testimony.Mr. Warner, the armed services committee chairman, said the message from last month’s elections was that “change is needed.”Mr. Gates said he agreed with Mr. Levin that it was “worth looking into”"" the idea of withdrawing troops to instill a “sense of urgency” in the Iraqi government to resolve sectarian strife.Moments later, under questioning from Senator McCain, Mr. Gates said there had not been sufficient troops in Iraq immediately after the 2003 invasion. If confirmed, he said, he would consult with ground commanders about whether they wanted additional forces.Mr. Gates also appeared to differ slightly with Mr. Bush’s frequent formulation that Iraq is the “central battlefield” in fighting terrorists. Asked if he agreed with that description, Mr. Gates called Iraq “one of the central fronts in the war on terror” but that the United States also faced a “dispersed” enemy of Islamic militants worldwide.But he was more direct in criticizing the Bush administration’s decision to disband the Iraqi Army and, for a time, to bar from government jobs tens of thousands of Iraqis who were members of Saddam Hussein’s Baath Party.Several Democrats, while applauding Mr. Gate’s forthrightness and willingness to consider new tactics, questioned whether President Bush would follow his advice on a new strategy. “Senator, I’m not coming here to be a bump on a log and not say exactly what I think,” Mr. Gates told Senator Edward Kennedy, a Masschusetts Democrat. He added: “There is still only one president of the United States. He will make the final decision.”Mr. Gates said he had abandoned certain positions he once held on certain national security issues. Asked about an article he wrote in 1994 advocating a military strike against North Korea’s nuclear facilities, Mr. Gates said he had changed his mind about how to deal with the communist country’s burgeoning nuclear program.“I believe that clearly at this point the best course is the diplomatic one,” he said.If confirmed, Mr. Gates said, he would make an early visit to Iraq to assess the situation there. Mr. Gates visited Iraq in September as a member of the Iraq Study Group, a post he resigned after being nominated by Mr. Bush on Nov. 8 to take charge at the Pentagon. Today, Mr. Bush and Mr. Baker had lunch together to talk about the direction the group would take, Dana Perino, a White House spokesman said.Mr. Gates did not say whether he intends to roll back any of Mr. Rumsfeld’s initiatives, but there were indications that his tenure at the Pentagon would be vastly different from the nearly six-year term of Mr. Rumsfeld.Mr. Rumsfeld came to the Pentagon brimming with ideas for a leaner, more agile military. He pledged to challenge what he saw as the status quo thinking of the military services, and he brought in civilian aides who clashed repeatedly with senior uniformed officers.Mr. Gates offered no such agenda or vision for the Pentagon. He said in his opening statement that the campaign to transform the military needed to continue, but admitted that he was not familiar with the details of Mr. Rumsfeld’s efforts.Mr. Gates’s easy path to confirmation contrasted with his two previous nominations before the Senate, both to become director of central intelligence. The first time, in 1987, Mr. Gates withdrew after questions about his role in the Iran-Contra affair, when proceeds from Iranian arms sales were diverted to anti-government rebels in Nicaragua.After being nominated again by President Bush’s father in 1991 to become the intelligence chief, Mr. Gates was confirmed but 31 Democrats voted against him, including 12 senators who are still in office.Senator Levin, one of those who opposed him in 1991, said after today’s committee vote: “I voted yes because in both the substance of his answers and the tone of his answers, he seemed open to course correction.”As the day wore on and his confirmation appeared increasingly secure, Mr. Gates seemed to absorb the weight of the job. He asked the committee to amplify on his morning remark about not winning in Iraq, saying he did not want troops to believe they are being unsuccessful.“Our military wins the battles that we fight,” Mr. Gates said. He added that “where we’re having our challenges, frankly, are in the areas of stabilization and political developments,” and said he believed that other federal agencies should contribute more assistance in Iraq.'"

"'06-12-05,'1','The Red Sox have had conversations with the Dodgers, the Angels, San Francisco, Seattle and San Diego about Ramírez, who has two years and about $38 million left on his eight-year, $160 million contract.Ramírez has asked to be traded multiple times, and the Red Sox, who are weary of the goofy behavior that accompanies his booming bat, are apparently trying to accommodate him.If the Red Sox cannot move Ramírez, they can tell him their efforts were futile and hope that it mollifies him.Although the Red Sox have spoken to several teams about Ramírez, they have not contacted the Mets to gauge their potential interest. The Mets signed Moises Alou to a one-year, $8.5 million deal, and he is expected to be their starting left fielder next season.Still, if the Red Sox wanted to exhaust every option to get the sweetest package for Ramírez, it would be logical to call the Mets.General Manager Omar Minaya has tried to obtain Ramírez in the past. If the Red Sox were close to trading Ramírez, Alou’s presence would probably not be enough of an impediment to prevent them from checking with the Mets.“I’ve been down that road before,” Minaya said about Ramírez.The Red Sox are also trying to complete a deal for outfielder J. D. Drew that could average $14 million a year, and they are making progress in their negotiations with pitcher Daisuke Matsuzaka.Matsuzaka has told his agent, Scott Boras, that he does not want to return to Japan.The Red Sox bid $51.1 million to gain the right to negotiate with Matsuzaka, and they do not want to pay him the $11 million or $12 million a year that Boras thinks Matsuzaka deserves as an ace pitcher. The Red Sox feel that the price that they posted to the Seibu Lions has to be factored into Matsuzaka’s potential salary.The going, going, almost gone aspect of Ramírez’s relationship with the Red Sox started more than three years ago. The Red Sox placed Ramírez on irrevocable waivers Oct. 29, 2003, meaning any team could have acquired him by assuming the five years and nearly $100 million left on his contract.When the Red Sox made that surprising move, they were clearly hoping that the Yankees would be compelled to claim him. The Yankees are one of the only teams that could decide, within 72 hours, to add a $20 million-a-year player. Ramírez, who is from the Washington Heights section of Manhattan, said in 2003 that he wanted to finish his career with the Yankees, a remark that infuriated Red Sox executives.After no one claimed Ramírez, the Red Sox reached an agreement to ship him to the Texas Rangers for Alex Rodriguez, but the players union did not allow the deal. Three years, one World Series title and endless headaches later, Ramírez’s status with the Red Sox is uncertain again.Tim Wakefield, a Red Sox pitcher who was here to have dinner with John Farrell, Boston’s new pitching coach, seemed immune to what might happen with his longtime teammate.“I don’t know anything,” Wakefield said. “In the off-season, I don’t read the newspapers.”Brian Sabean, the San Francisco general manager, said the Giants remained interested in re-signing Barry Bonds. “Does it make baseball sense? Yes,” Sabean said. Other than the Giants, there does not seem to be much of a market for Bonds, who has 734 career homers. ... Chris Carpenter, the National League’s 2005 Cy Young award winner, signed a five-year deal for about $65 million to stay with the St. Louis Cardinals. Carpenter was 15-8 with a 3.09 earned run average for the World Series champions last season. ... Outfielder José Guillén, who played for the Washington Nationals last season, signed a one-year, $5.5 million contract with the Seattle Mariners. He will be playing with his eighth team in a career that began in 1997.'"
"'06-12-05,'1','Mr. Hakim, for his part, flatly rejected one of the recommendations that the bipartisan Iraq Study Group is expected to make this week — a call for some type of regional conference to help foster peace.“We believe that the Iraqi issue should be solved by the Iraqis with the help of friends everywhere,” Mr. Hakim said, speaking through an interpreter. “But we reject any attempts to have a regional or international role in solving the Iraqi issue. We cannot bypass the political process.”Mr. Hakim, who wears the black turban of a descendant of the Prophet Muhammad, has close ties to Iran. He remarked last week that if Iraq deteriorated into civil war, Sunni Arabs would be the “biggest losers” — a comment that was widely interpreted as a veiled threat to Sunnis. He is also the main Shiite leader pushing to partition the country into autonomous regions, a proposal that Mr. Bush and Mr. Maliki strongly oppose.The White House is in the thick of re-evaluating its stance in Iraq. Mr. Bush met with Mr. Maliki last week in Amman, Jordan. On Wednesday, the president will receive the recommendations of the independent Iraq Study Group, led by James A. Baker III, a former secretary of state, and Lee H. Hamilton, a former Democratic congressman.The Senate Armed Services Committee has asked Mr. Baker and Mr. Hamilton to testify about the report on Capitol Hill on Thursday morning. That same day, Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain, Mr. Bush’s ally on Iraq, will visit the White House. Next month, Mr. Bush will receive Tariq al-Hashemi, the leader of the most powerful Sunni Arab party in Iraq.Stephen J. Hadley, the national security adviser, outlined the strategy of trying to meet with Iraqi politicians to gather support for the Iraqi government in a classified memo shown to and published by The New York Times last week. “Press Sunni and other Iraqi leaders (especially Hakim) to support Maliki,” Mr. Hadley wrote in a section outlining how the White House might drive a wedge between Mr. Maliki and Mr. Sadr.By meeting with leaders other than Mr. Maliki, Mr. Bush runs the risk of undermining the Iraqi prime minister — whom he declared “the right guy for Iraq” during their meeting in Amman — by seeming to hedge his bets with others who might claim power should the Maliki government fail.In an interview with Brit Hume of Fox News, Mr. Bush said he raised the issue with Mr. Hakim. “I said, ‘I just want you to understand, as you know, I met with the prime minister, the head of the government,’ ” Mr. Bush said. “And that I don’t want the prime minister to construe that this meeting in any way doesn’t support him and he said, ‘Look, I understand that as well.’ ”Mr. Hakim’s close ties to Iran also pose potential problems for the Bush administration. His party, usually referred to by its acronym, Sciri, was founded in Iran and its armed wing, the Badr Organization, was widely accused by Sunni Arabs of operating death squads in the aftermath of the American invasion.Mr. Hakim fended off the charges on Monday in an appearance at the United States Institute for Peace after his White House visit. “We reject all those accusations,” Mr. Hakim said when asked by a reporter if his organization was responsible for murder, torture and abduction. He added: “We say there is no evidence. Nothing of that happened.”At the White House, the press secretary, Tony Snow, was peppered with questions about why Mr. Bush was even meeting with Mr. Hakim.“This is a man who spent 20 years in Iran when Saddam Hussein was in power,” Mr. Snow said, “but he’s also made it clear that he sees himself as an Iraqi leader, not someone who is beholden to Iran.”'"

"'06-12-05,'1','Mr. Aguirre, who led the hedge fund investigation until he was fired last year, has told members of Congress that senior S.E.C. officials blocked him from taking testimony from John J. Mack, an influential Wall Street executive and friend of Pequot’s founder, Arthur J. Samberg.S.E.C. officials said they turned down Mr. Aguirre’s request at that time because he had not made a strong enough case for taking Mr. Mack’s testimony, records show. The S.E.C. took Mr. Mack’s testimony about a year later, and formally closed the Pequot investigation last week without taking any enforcement action. Mr. Samberg and Mr. Mack have repeatedly denied any improper conduct.Mr. Ribelin did not return a message left at his office yesterday.An S.E.C. spokesman, John J. Nester, declined to comment, saying, “We’ll just let our testimony speak for itself.”Senator Specter, a Pennsylvania Republican, said he was interested in finding out why S.E.C. officials, who had previously written favorable evaluations of Mr. Aguirre’s work, suddenly wrote a critical evaluation that covered the same time period.Government officials said the S.E.C. supervisors never discussed the evaluation with Mr. Aguirre and then placed it in his employment file after he was fired on Sept. 1, 2005.Just days before his firing, Mr. Aguirre was awarded a two-step merit pay increase.According to a government official, Mr. Aguirre’s direct supervisor, Robert Hanson, an S.E.C. branch chief, said the supplemental evaluation was written at the suggestion of Paul R. Berger, a former associate director of enforcement. Mr. Berger declined to discuss the evaluation yesterday, saying he could not comment on personnel matters.Senate investigators have also been looking at circumstances surrounding Mr. Berger’s decision to take a job at the law firm of Debevoise & Plimpton this year.Debevoise was hired by Morgan Stanley’s board to vet Mr. Mack before he was named to head the company in June 2005. As part of that vetting process, Mary Jo White, the former New York federal prosecutor now at Debevoise, did contact the S.E.C.’s director of enforcement, Linda Thomsen, about Mr. Mack, but the firm says it never suggested to anyone at the commission that the investigation be stopped.Mr. Aguirre has told Congress that after a compliance officer at Morgan Stanley called the S.E.C. in June of 2005, inquiring whether Mr. Mack might face an enforcement action, Mr. Aguirre’s Pequot investigation was essentially shut down.Mr. Aguirre said that before answering the compliance officer, he consulted with his two superiors, Mr. Hanson and Mark Kreitman, an assistant director of enforcement. According to Mr. Aguirre, Mr. Kreitman favored telling Morgan Stanley that Mr. Mack was indeed a target, but first he informed his boss, Mr. Berger, by speakerphone.With Mr. Aguirre listening in, Mr. Berger overruled Mr. Kreitman, saying in effect that the S.E.C. would most likely not file charges against Mr. Mack, and that nothing should be said to Morgan Stanley, Mr. Aguirre said.Mr. Berger said yesterday that he had told Morgan Stanley “that it was premature to say whether or not Mr. Mack had any exposure.”Several months later, Mr. Berger said, an S.E.C. colleague who was interviewing at Debevoise offered to mention that Mr. Berger might have an interest in working there, too. Mr. Berger agreed.In a statement yesterday, Debevoise’s presiding partner, Martin Frederic Evans, said, “Sometime in September 2005, well after our work for the Morgan Stanley board had concluded, we were told that Mr. Berger might have an interest in talking to Debevoise, but the firm did not contact Mr. Berger, nor did the firm hear from him till January 2006.”Mr. Evans said that neither Mr. Mack nor the S.E.C. investigation were mentioned in the firm’s employment discussions with Mr. Berger.Once that contact began, Mr. Berger said yesterday, “I recused myself from any matter with which the firm was involved, including the Pequot investigation.”Mr. Aguirre has already provided Senate investigators with lengthy statements and dozens of contemporaneous e-mail exchanges he had with S.E.C. supervisors. He is also expected to testify at the hearing today, along with senior S.E.C. officials, including Ms. Thomsen and Mr. Berger.The committee is also expected to question the agency’s inspector general, Walter J. Stachnik, who initially concluded that the S.E.C. had done nothing wrong. But after the disclosure that Mr. Stachnik’s office had not interviewed Mr. Aguirre before rendering its judgment, the inspector general reopened his investigation.“These folks are going to be under oath, and I’m going to try to get to the bottom of it,” Senator Specter said.The senator said he would call for legislation requiring hedge funds to register with the S.E.C. if they manage pension fund investments or money from small investors.Before the S.E.C. decided this year not to file any enforcement action against Pequot, the agency had been investigating a number of profitable trades by the hedge fund in advance of mergers or other market-moving news.Mr. Aguirre began investigating Pequot soon after he started at the agency in September 2004.“When you are inquiring into areas like this, it’s very delicate and people are very reluctant to talk,” Senator Specter said. “These investigations are not easy and not totally predictable.”The S.E.C. is also under review by the Government Accountability Office, the investigative arm of Congress. Charles E. Grassley, the Iowa Republican who is chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, asked for the review in September because he was growing concerned, he said, about whether the S.E.C. was “faithfully adhering to its mission.”The G.A.O. will also examine how well the commission monitors self-regulatory organizations — like the New York Stock Exchange and NASD — that refer cases to the commission for possible enforcement actions.'"
"'06-12-05,'1','FRANKFURT, Dec. 4 — Airbus said on Monday that it had no immediate plans to seek government-backed financing for its new wide-body aircraft, the A350 XWB, avoiding another round of trans-Atlantic recriminations over aircraft subsidies.Though he refused to rule out going to European governments in the future, the chief executive of Airbus, Louis Gallois, said the company could handle the initial phase of the $13.2 billion development program from its own cash resources and by sharing the costs with its suppliers.“We have no imminent cash needs,” Mr. Gallois said at a news conference in Paris.Airbus is currently in discussions with “about 10” potentially significant partners that could help shoulder both the risk and the potential reward of developing the A350, Mr. Gallois said. Airbus expects to have work allocated and partners selected by the spring, he said.Mr. Gallois also said that Airbus, which has been hit hard by the decline of the dollar because its planes are priced in declining dollars, would seek to acquire a “natural hedging” against this currency risk by outsourcing $2.4 billion of the development costs to American companies.“We will be very happy to have American partners,” he said.Mr. Gallois emphasized that the A350 project would support Airbus’s overhaul program, known as Power8, which it developed in response to lengthy delays and production problems with its A380 superjumbo jet. The A380 was developed with aid from European governments.'"
"'06-12-05,'1','And the biotechnology companies with the most promising drugs under development would not come cheap. This has already been a record year for acquisitions of biotechnology companies, with 13 major deals valued at $19 billion, according to an analysis by Sanford C. Bernstein & Company.Pfizer, though, has little choice but to continue seeking partnerships with smaller biotechnology and drug companies, said David Risinger, a Merrill Lynch analyst.“They have their work cut out for them,” Mr. Risinger said. “They’re going to have to pursue a lot of initiatives over the next few years to rebuild the pipeline. There’s no quick fix.”Pfizer executives have said the company intends to look at deals of all sizes, from individual licensing agreements to large-scale takeovers. Pfizer may also allow companies it buys to operate as separate organizations, rather than being absorbed into Pfizer, which has 106,000 employees.Torcetrapib, the drug that Pfizer discontinued, was intended to treat heart disease. But a large clinical trial showed that it actually increased the risk of death, forcing Pfizer to end its development. Pfizer had invested close to $1 billion in torcetrapib, whose champion was John LaMattina, the organic chemist who is the company’s chief scientist. Analysts had predicted the drug could have had annual sales of up to $15 billion.Introducing major new drugs on a regular basis is crucial for Pfizer. Like all drug makers, Pfizer has a limited period of time to sell its medicines under patent protection before generic copies are allowed to enter the market and prices fall 80 to 95 percent.In 2010, Lipitor, Pfizer’s cholesterol-lowering drug that is the world’s top-selling medicine, will become subject to competition in the United States, jeopardizing more than $7 billion in sales.Pfizer had hoped to make up for those lost sales with torcetrapib. Now it must find other alternatives. And because the clinical trials required to bring new drugs to market can take five years or more, the company has few good choices in the short term.So even though Pfizer’s current position is strong, analysts say the crisis it faces is real. Yesterday, Moody’s Investors Service said it might lower its rating on Pfizer’s bonds, which are currently graded at Aaa, the highest possible.Pfizer’s stock closed yesterday at $24.90, down $2.96, or 10.6 percent. Trading volume was extraordinarily heavy, with 289 million shares changing hands. In the short run, Pfizer may try to buttress its slumping stock by raising its annual dividend, currently 96 cents a share, by 15 percent or more, analysts said. At yesterday’s closing price, an annual payout of $1.10 a share would give Pfizer a dividend yield of about 4.5 percent, triple that of the average big stock, potentially attracting value investors to the company.In the long run, though, Pfizer must find new drugs if it is to continue to prosper. And going outside the company will cost money.In the biotech deals this year, premiums have been at an all-time high, averaging 62 percent over the stock price this year, compared with 49 percent over the last eight years, according to the Bernstein & Company analysis.“Most deals now involve auctions with multiple bidding parties,” said Geoffrey C. Porges, a biotechnology analyst at Bernstein. “And Pfizer’s desperation is certainly going to increase the intensity of those auctions and raise the premiums that are already at all-time highs.”Pfizer might also face some key strategic choices in such deals. One is whether it is willing to move away from its traditional model of chemical pills for chronic diseases toward the injectable protein drugs being developed by biotechnology companies, which tend to be aimed at cancer and other more specialized conditions.Finding a big heart drug to replace torcetrapib through an acquisition of a biotechnology company is likely to be difficult, because few biotech companies can afford the huge clinical trials needed for such broadly used drugs.One biotech company, Isis Pharmaceuticals, recently reported a successful midstage trial for a cholesterol-lowering drug. But the technology to make that drug, known as antisense, has had a troubled history. Isis shares rose 9 percent yesterday to $11.34.Microbia, a privately held biotechnology company in Cambridge, Mass., has a drug in early clinical trials that blocks the absorption of cholesterol from food. That is the same approach used by Zetia, a drug sold by Schering-Plough and Merck, which is also combined with a statin in the drug Vytorin.Pfizer is generally considered a desirable partner or acquirer, because of its reputation for paying large sums for companies or products, and putting big marketing power behind them.“People view them as tremendous commercializers,” said James Scopa, a general partner at MPM Capital, a large venture capital and investment firm. Two companies MPM has backed were sold to Pfizer.One of those companies, Rinat Neuroscience, was sold to Pfizer in April for $500 million, the most ever paid for a privately held biotechnology company. Pfizer was mainly interested in an Alzheimer’s drug that was not yet even in clinical trials, and moved swiftly to beat several other suitors.“From the time we told Pfizer we were picking them to the time we had a signed deal was a week,” said David Pritchard, who was chief business officer at Rinat at the time.Still, some experts say Pfizer is also too quick to drop partners or drugs when things do not go right. In June, it ended a deal for an insomnia drug with Neurocrine Biosciences after the drug was not approved by the Food and Drug Administration.“Pfizer in the last three years has been much more cash and carry,” said Mark Edwards, managing director of Recombinant Capital, a company that tracks biotechnology alliances and mergers. “Go in and get what you want and if it disappoints you, drop it.”Joseph Dougherty, managing director of Seaview Securities, a biotechnology investment bank, said Pfizer had such deep pockets and broad interests that it could go after almost anyone, although buying one of the largest biotech companies would hurt the company’s per-share earnings.MedImmune, which has a billion-dollar respiratory drug on the market and a market capitalization of $7.9 billion, would not be out of the question, he said.Mr. Porges of Bernstein & Company said Medarex, a company that has fundamental technology for developing monoclonal antibodies and a market capitalization of $1.7 billion, would be a good choice.Pfizer already has an extensive collaboration with Medarex, although Medarex also has deals with several other companies.'"
"'06-12-05,'1','“You want to have those marquee games on your résumé,” said Jim Schaus, the athletic director at Wichita State, which is now ranked 10th.Schaus said that when 34 at-large bids are debated by the N.C.A.A. selection committee, “a committee member from a major conference wants more sizzle” than he may see from victories against only Missouri Valley opponents.Along with the growing number of tournaments that teams are playing in the early part of the season, “guarantee games” like Wichita State-Syracuse demonstrate that, for midmajor teams like the Shockers, the competition is intense early. Prominent teams from major conferences can work out their kinks and experiment with different lineups during the nonconference season, but this time of year can be do or die for midmajor teams that are hoping to build their N.C.A.A. tournament résumés.“If you don’t play a tough enough schedule, you don’t position yourself for success,” Schaus said.Last season, the Shockers compiled a 26-9 record and reached the Round of 16 in the N.C.A.A. tournament before losing to George Mason of the Colonial Athletic Association.The rise of the midmajors came into focus last spring, when George Mason reached the Final Four. This season, Wichita State has already won at George Mason and at Louisiana State, which also played in the Final Four last season. Generally, the major conferences are regarded as those that participate in the Bowl Championship Series in football and also have long-standing basketball traditions.They include the Atlantic Coast Conference, the Big East, the Big Ten, the Pac-10, the Southeastern Conference and the Big 12. The midmajors are six to eight leagues with less television exposure and revenue and, in general, a lesser profile in football.Other teams from midmajor conferences that have already improved their status this season are Oral Roberts (3-3), from the Mid-Continent Conference, which won at Kansas; Butler (9-0), from the Horizon League; and another M.V.C. team, Missouri State, which defeated Wisconsin when it was ranked No. 7.Butler won last month’s N.I.T. Season Tip-Off tournament at Madison Square Garden with victories over Tennessee and Gonzaga. Earlier, Butler defeated Indiana and Notre Dame. “Marquee wins,” Schaus called them.Oral Roberts, coached by Scott Sutton, reached the N.C.A.A. tournament last season for the first time in 22 years but, seeded 16th, lost to top-seeded Memphis. Now, the Golden Eagles are more ambitious.Of his team’s 78-71 victory over the Jayhawks on Nov. 15, Sutton said, “That win alone will carry a lot of weight” when tournament bids and seedings are decided. He added, “It could mean two or three spots in the seeding — 13th or 14th instead of 16th.”Sutton, who is more involved than some coaches in scheduling, has two more games on his road schedule — at Georgetown on Dec. 9 and at Arkansas on Dec. 22 — that are considered guarantee games, meaning Oral Roberts will be paid by the host team.“I wouldn’t do this with a young team,” said Sutton, whose team starts two seniors and three juniors.He said a young team might be discouraged by losses on the road to more prestigious teams. But not this Eagles team, Sutton said. “I like playing in big-time environments,” he said.One negative aspect of playing guarantee games, Sutton and others said, is that teams from major conferences will not reciprocate by playing on the campuses of teams from midmajor conferences.Doug Elgin, commissioner of the M.V.C., said, “Many of our coaches have staunchly refused to go on the road” to play teams that will not return a home game.“The risk can be job security, or it’s going to cost you ticket sales” if you lose too many of them, he said.Elgin said he urged his teams to save a road date for a late addition to the schedule as leverage with a top program that needs to fill an open home date. Such teams may agree to a home-and-home arrangement out of desperation, he said.Another way around guarantee games on an opponent’s floor is to play tournaments at neutral sites, as Butler did in New York. Schaus said Wichita State would play next season in the Virgin Islands in an early-season tournament that will include Georgia Tech and Notre Dame, well-known programs that might not otherwise play the Shockers.Jon LeCrone, commissioner of the Horizon League, said that his conference had success with such tournaments this season and that creative scheduling in the early season was “probably more of an art than it is a science.”Referring to guarantee games, LeCrone said host teams paid “opponents to come in, so opponents take the money, come play the game and generally are saddled with a loss.”But, LeCrone added, “If you can put 40, 50 or 60 thousand dollars into your athletics budget for one game, you’re probably going to get beat, but that’s a tradeout, and some schools look at it that way.”Elgin said, “The playing surface is anything but level from the get-go,” because some teams played most of their nonconference games at home while others were forced to play most of their nonconference games on the road.Elgin said he did not mind the midmajor label; he uses it himself to describe his conference. But Schaus of Wichita State objected to it. “I don’t like that term,” he said. “Our program is 17th in the country. We’re good. We’re strong.”That is one of the reasons Syracuse booked them. Rob Edson, senior associate athletic director for Syracuse, said his program had arranged nine guarantee games at home this season because it sold 17,000 season tickets and knew weekend home games against ascendant programs like Wichita State would draw customers.“The revenue is obviously significant, so it behooves us, purely from a financial perspective,” Edson said. He said that prices of guarantee games had increased significantly in recent years and that some teams included clauses in coaching contracts that paid the coaches a percentage of bonus money from guarantee games.'"
"'06-12-05,'1','CHICAGO, Dec. 4 (Reuters) — Children should be exposed to fewer television ads for anti-impotence drugs and more for birth control, and need to be shielded from an advertising onslaught in general, the leading United States pediatricians’ group said on Monday.The American Academy of Pediatrics, in a new policy statement, also urged limits to children’s television viewing and access to the Internet, as well as restrictions on how alcoholic beverage makers promote their products.“If we taught kids media literacy, you can essentially immunize kids against advertising,” said Dr. Victor C. Strasburger, a pediatrician at the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque and the lead author of the statement.The pediatricians group urged that erectile dysfunction drug ads not be shown until after 10 p.m., when fewer children are watching television.Children who watch more television — presumably exposing them to ads for fast food, snacks, soft drinks and candy — are more likely to be obese, although no studies show a direct correlation between advertising and obesity, he said.Jim Davidson, a spokesman for the Advertising Coalition, said that food companies and advertisers had already responded to the obesity epidemic by promoting healthier products and by following recently revised guidelines for commercials directed at children.Makers of tobacco and hard liquor have long been restricted from advertising on television, and Mr. Davidson noted that brewers had pledged not to advertise on TV shows where children make up more than half of viewers.'"
"'06-12-05,'1','Another witness, a young man who has pleaded guilty to murder in exchange for a positive letter to his sentencing judge, has testified that Mr. Wilson yelled at the police van. But that witness, Jessie Jacobus, quoted Mr. Wilson asking the officers: “You didn’t find what you was looking for tonight?”The mere act of yelling at the police van proved to be an important break in the case, as it drew attention and suspicion, leading to the arrest of Mr. Jacobus and the unsuccessful first pursuit of Mr. Wilson.Beyond that, the exact words yelled could portray varying impressions of whether the defendant knew that the men who had been shot were police officers. Though of no legal relevance for the charges in the indictment, that question has become the trial’s unspoken theme.“When this statement was made,” asked an assistant United States attorney, Jack Smith, “who did you understand it to be directed toward?”Then the officer, a 10-year veteran of the force who has patrolled the area of the Stapleton Houses for eight years, recounted some details that he remembered because they seemed odd at the time. The man who yelled at the van, he said, ran away with his arms straight up in the air, entered a building of the Stapleton Houses and shut his pursuers out with the door’s magnetic lock.On the witness stand, the officer was shown a patterned ball cap and black jacket that prosecutors say belonged to Mr. Wilson. He said the clothing worn by the man he had chased looked “similar.”For the moment, lawyers for Mr. Wilson ignored the deeper implications of the statement attributed to their client. Instead, by seeking to undermine Officer Six’s credibility, they disputed whether it was made at all.Under sharp questioning, Officer Six conceded that he had made no record of the yelling incident in his memo book, the log that patrol officers consult to fill out reports.He also had failed to identify Mr. Wilson in a police lineup.Lawyers for Mr. Wilson also sought to undermine the credibility of a witness who said he gave Mr. Wilson the murder weapon before the shooting. That witness, Mitchell Diaz, 22, is cooperating with the government as part of a plea bargain.A defense lawyer, Mitchell Dinnerstein, addressed Mr. Diaz in quiet, gentle tones. The murder charges rely on demonstrating that Mr. Wilson shot the detectives while acting as a member of the criminal organization prosecutors call the Stapleton Crew, but when Mr. Dinnerstein asked Mr. Diaz about the group’s members, he called them the “boys of Stapleton.”He challenged Mr. Diaz’s memory of a confession attributed to Mr. Wilson, asking, “Would it be fair to say that when all this was going on, all these police officers, you were scared?”Mr. Diaz said he had been scared.“It’s hard to remember what people said, isn’t it?” Mr. Dinnerstein asked, drawing a rebuke from Judge Nicholas G. Garaufis.After more than an hour, he shifted his tone: “You told them a little bit of the truth, in your mind, but other things were just lies.”A prosecutor, Morris J. Fodeman, sought to undo any damage by showing jurors pictures of the men he calls the Stapleton Crew. In them, they wore scowls and mustaches.“Is this one of the ‘boys’ we’re talking about?” Mr. Fodeman asked.'"
"'06-12-05,'1','Morgan Stanley has acquired Brookville Capital Management, a four-year-old company that oversees about $221 million in debt, in the firm’s fourth investment in a hedge fund in two months.Brookville was founded by three former Bankers Trust Corporation executives, David Reiss, Jacob E.

"'06-12-05,'1','Much has been written about the dangers of driving while using a cellphone. But how about walking and talking on the phone?Researchers say they have evidence that this, too, can pose a risk, and not just from irritated fellow pedestrians who don’t want to hear the details of your personal life.The researchers, Julie Hatfield and Susanne Murphy of the University of New South Wales in Australia, set out to see if people who are talking on the phone pay less attention at intersections.They observed more than 500 people crossing the street and found that those who were talking on the phone did indeed appear more distracted than those who were not.In the study, which appears in Accident Analysis & Prevention, men on the phone crossed more slowly at intersections without traffic signals. And women on the phone not only crossed more slowly, but also were less likely to look at traffic before setting out or to wait for cars to stop.'"
"'06-12-05,'1','But Mr. DeCota said that the Port Authority was considering allowing the program to be installed next year at the only two terminals it controls: the central terminal at La Guardia Airport and Terminal B at Newark. He said the Port Authority might soon start encouraging other airlines to make room for Clear-registered travelers at all three of the local airports.Mr. DeCota said he became more comfortable with the idea after the federal Transportation Security Administration decided recently that the registered travelers would not require their own lane for screening but could share one with other travelers.Customers who sign up for the Clear program and agree to pay the annual fee — $28 of which goes to the T.S.A. — can check in at a kiosk, then proceed directly through the final stage of screening. The kiosks identify travelers within seconds by matching their fingerprints or scanning their irises.Mr. Brill said that possibly later this month the kiosks at Terminal 7 will also be able to scan the shoes of travelers so that they will not have to be removed.But those promises have not persuaded officials of Continental, the dominant carrier at Newark Liberty International Airport.“We don’t support the registered-traveler program in its current form,” said Julie King, a spokeswoman for Continental in Houston. “We just don’t feel it provides significant benefits to the people who participate.”Continental already provides express lines through security for its best customers; Mr. Brill said that “there are some airlines that do fear that this will replace their first-class lines.” But he said he believed that Continental officials could still be convinced that the service saved travelers significant time and trouble.Separately yesterday, U.S. Helicopter Corporation announced that it would expand its airport shuttle service to Newark on Dec. 18 through a partnership with Continental. For a fare of $159 each way, passengers will be able to check their luggage and clear federal security at the Downtown Manhattan Heliport, then board a Sikorsky S-76 helicopter for an eight-minute flight to the secure side of Continental’s main terminal.Jerry Murphy, the chief executive of U.S. Helicopter, said one quick ride from the heliport near Wall Street to the tarmac in Newark should be enough to convince a traveler of the luxury of flying to the airport. Once passengers are on the ground, vans will shuttle them to Terminal C or Terminal A, where they can walk to any gate without passing through another security check, Mr. Murphy said.The T.S.A. set up a checkpoint at the downtown heliport when U.S. Helicopter began service between there and the American Airlines terminal at Kennedy Airport in March, making it the first “federalized” heliport in the country. The administration agreed to spend $560,000 to install the checkpoint and to provide staffers to screen baggage and passengers there.Ann Davis, a spokeswoman for the T.S.A. in Boston, said the administration has been negotiating with U.S. Helicopter in recent weeks about setting up a similar checkpoint at a heliport on the East River at 34th Street.Mr. Murphy said he hoped to begin scheduled service between the 34th Street Heliport and Kennedy Airport in January. He would not say whether his company or the federal government would pay for the screening of those passengers.'"
"'06-12-05,'1','The G.O.P. is the party of risk, aggression, military assertion and dominance — an approach that led to the implosion in Iraq and the Republicans’ defeat in November. Now the Democrats have a chance to demonstrate a core difference in how the two parties calculate and manage risk.In “Fiasco,” Thomas Ricks describes the results of the Republican approach: “Bush’s decision to invade Iraq ... ultimately may come to be seen as one of the most profligate actions in the history of American foreign policy. ... The U.S.-led invasion was launched recklessly, with a flawed plan for war and a worse approach to occupation.”While inflicting destruction on the Iraqis, Bush multiplied America’s enemies and endangered this nation’s military, economic health and international stature. Courting risk without managing it, Bush repeatedly and remorselessly failed to accurately evaluate the consequences of his actions.The embroilment in Iraq is not an aberration. It stems from core party principles equally evident on the domestic front. For a quarter-century, the Republican temper — its reckless drive to jettison the social safety net; its support of violence in law enforcement and in national defense; its advocacy of regressive taxation, environmental hazard and pro-business deregulation; its ‘remoralizing’ of the pursuit of wealth — has been judged by many voters as essential to America’s position in the world, producing more benefit than cost.While some Republican long shots have paid off handsomely (the Reagan administration’s accelerated arms race arguably drove the former Soviet Union into bankruptcy), now the dice are turning up snake eyes. In November, voters concluded that the Bush administration had run one risk too many. After 40 years of ascendancy, the G.O.P. has provided Democrats with an opening. Will the Democratic Party, often insufficiently authoritative and bold, manage risk better? Democrats arguably suffer from their own impaired judgment: utopian faith in the power of negotiation and compromise — naïve, perhaps, in a world where the threat of bloodshed is endemic.'"

"'06-12-06,'0','The group, headed by James A. Baker III and Lee H. Hamilton, is expected to propose that American combat troops be pulled back from Iraq, but not necessarily withdrawn, by sometime in 2008.In 2003, Mr. Gates supported the administration’s decision to invade Iraq. In his testimony on Tuesday, however, he made clear that his operating style and approach would be in some respects different from those of Mr. Rumsfeld and his deputies, who have led the Defense Department for nearly six years. Mr. Gates expressed grave reservations about taking military action against Iran, an idea that the Bush administration has not ruled out in trying to halt its nuclear program.“I think that military action against Iran would be an absolute last resort,” Mr. Gates said. “I think that we have seen in Iraq that once war is unleashed, it becomes unpredictable. And I think that the consequences of a conflict, a military conflict, with Iran could be quite dramatic. And therefore, I would counsel against military action, except as a last resort.”Mr. Gates said he also opposed any attack on Syria, which the Bush administration has criticized, along with Iran, for contributing to the instability in Iraq.Mr. Gates’s most direct statements about Iraq came during exchanges with Senators Carl Levin, the Michigan Democrat who will take over as the panel’s chairman, and John McCain of Arizona, who will become the top-ranking Republican.“Do you believe that we are currently winning in Iraq?” asked Mr. Levin, who has pushed for announcing a date to begin withdrawing American troops from Iraq. “No, sir,” Mr. Gates replied, adding that he did not believe that the United States was losing, either.Senator John W. Warner, Republican of Virginia, pointed out that Gen. Peter Pace, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, had used language similar to Mr. Gates’s at a policy forum in Washington on Monday.As recently as October, Mr. Bush said that “absolutely, we’re winning” in Iraq, though he also made clear he was dissatisfied with the pace of progress.Mr. Warner, the chairman of the Senate committee, said the message from last month’s elections was that “change is needed.”Mr. Gates said he agreed with Mr. Levin that it was “worth looking into” the idea of withdrawing troops to instill a “sense of urgency” in the Iraqi government to resolve sectarian strife. But he ruled out setting a date for a withdrawal.Under questioning from Mr. McCain, Mr. Gates said there had not been sufficient troops in Iraq immediately after the 2003 invasion. If confirmed, he said, he would consult with ground commanders about whether they wanted additional forces.Mr. Gates also appeared to differ slightly with Mr. Bush’s frequent declaration that Iraq is the “central battlefield” in fighting terrorists. Asked if he agreed with that description, Mr. Gates called Iraq “one of the central fronts in the war on terror” but said the United States also faced a “dispersed” enemy of Islamic militants worldwide.But he was more direct in criticizing the Bush administration’s decision to disband the Iraqi Army and, for a time, to bar from government jobs tens of thousands of Iraqis who were members of Saddam Hussein’s Baath Party.Several Democrats, while applauding Mr. Gates’s forthrightness and willingness to consider new tactics, questioned whether Mr. Bush would follow his advice on a new strategy.“Senator, I’m not coming here to be a bump on a log and not say exactly what I think,” Mr. Gates told Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts. He added: “There is still only one president of the United States. He will make the final decision.”Mr. Gates said he had abandoned certain positions he once held on certain national security issues. Asked about an article he wrote in 1994 advocating a military strike against North Korea’s nuclear facilities, Mr. Gates said he had changed his mind about how to deal with the communist country’s developing nuclear program. “I believe that clearly at this point, the best course is the diplomatic one,” Mr. Gates said.If confirmed, Mr. Gates said, he would make an early visit to Iraq to assess the situation. He visited Iraq in September as a member of the Iraq Study Group, a post he resigned after being nominated by Mr. Bush on Nov. 8 to take charge at the Pentagon. On Tuesday, Mr. Bush and Mr. Baker ate lunch together to talk about the recommendations the group would make, said Dana Perino, a White House spokeswoman.Mr. Gates did not say whether he intended to roll back any of Mr. Rumsfeld’s initiatives, but there were indications that his tenure at the Pentagon would be vastly different from the nearly six-year term of Mr. Rumsfeld.Mr. Rumsfeld arrived at the Pentagon brimming with ideas for a leaner, more agile military. He promised to challenge what he saw as the status quo thinking of the military services, and he brought in civilian aides who clashed repeatedly with senior uniformed officers.Mr. Gates offered no such agenda or vision. He said the campaign to transform the military needed to continue, but admitted that he was not familiar with the details of Mr. Rumsfeld’s efforts. He also questioned some of the Pentagon’s efforts before the Iraq war to analyze raw intelligence.Mr. Gates’s presumably easy path to confirmation contrasts with his two previous nomination hearings before the Senate, both for the post of director of central intelligence. Mr. Gates withdrew his nomination the first time, in 1987, after questions arose about his role in the Iran-contra affair.After being nominated again by Mr. Bush’s father in 1991, Mr. Gates was confirmed, but 31 Democrats voted against him, including 12 senators who are still in office.Mr. Levin, one of those who opposed him in 1991, said after Tuesday’s vote, “I voted yes because in both the substance of his answers and the tone of his answers, he seemed open to course correction.”As the day wore on and his confirmation appeared increasingly secure, Mr. Gates seemed to absorb the weight of the job. He asked to expound on his morning remark about not winning in Iraq, saying he did not want the troops to believe they were being unsuccessful.“Our military wins the battles that we fight,” Mr. Gates said. He added that “where we’re having our challenges, frankly, are in the areas of stabilization and political developments,” and that he believed that other federal agencies should contribute more assistance in Iraq.WASHINGTON, Dec. 5 — The White House under Mr. Bush and the United Nations under Kofi Annan have not exactly gone together like Mom and apple pie. But the White House spokesman, Tony Snow, predicted that all would be amicable when Mr. Bush, Mr. Annan and their top aides met for a final time Tuesday over dinner in the White House residence, where Mr. Bush was to toast Mr. Annan on the completion later this month of his tenure as the United Nations secretary general.It was unclear, however, whether the White House had a table long enough or wide enough to separate John Bolton, who has resigned as United Nations ambassador, and Mr. Annan’s top deputy, Mark Malloch Brown, who was visibly pleased on Monday at the news of Mr. Bolton’s departure.Mr. Snow said he was not worried. “We practice effective diplomacy,” he said. “I expect it will be perfectly pleasant.”'"
"'06-12-06,'0','American diplomats say they could use an international conference on Iraq, possibly the one called for by Mr. Maliki or a resurrection of a forum held in Egypt in 2004, to engage in talks with Iran and Syria.The talk of a regional conference came as a spokesman for the American military command, Maj. Gen. William B. Caldwell IV, said the Iraqis would take operational control of all Iraqi Army divisions by early summer, and responsibility for security in all 18 provinces by next fall.He said the timetable resulted from discussions last week in Jordan between President Bush and Mr. Maliki, who has been pressing the White House for an accelerated transfer of authority. So far, the American command has given the Iraqis operational control of 3 of the 10 Iraqi Army divisions and security oversight in two provinces.Mr. Maliki’s statement on an international meeting was the first time the prime minister had indicated that he wanted a wider regional discussion. It contradicted the stand taken by Iraq’s president, Jalal Talabani, as well as that of a powerful Shiite politician, Abdul Aziz al-Hakim, who met with President Bush in Washington on Monday. Both rejected a conference, saying that Iraq would find solutions through internal deliberations.Mr. Maliki told reporters that a conference should held in Iraq, and that he was seeking support — not interference — from his neighbors.“We will send envoys to neighboring countries to exchange opinions on matters and to ask the governments of these countries to help reinforce security and stability in Iraq,” Mr. Maliki said. “After settling the political climate, we will call for a convening of only those countries that want to ensure the security and stability of Iraq.”Though Iran, Syria and Saudi Arabia have long been accused of aiding militants in Iraq, and the country’s Shiite revival has already sent ripples across other Arab nations, most noticeably Lebanon, rulers around the Middle East have been expressing even more concerns about cross-border destabilization. King Abdullah II of Jordan warned late last month, for example, that the Middle East could be shaken by civil wars in Iraq, Lebanon and the Palestinian territories by early next year.Representatives from the region have met before to discuss Iraq, most recently in September, when foreign ministers from predominantly Sunni Arab countries converged in Cairo. The conference proposed by Mr. Maliki could take place at a higher level and would presumably be more wide ranging, to possibly include Turkey and Iran. Syria reopened its embassy in Baghdad last month after a hiatus of more than two decades.One of the first international conferences on Iraq was held in 2004 at the Egyptian Red Sea resort of Sharm el Sheik. The conference was attended by the United Nations and the Arab League, as well as Saudi Arabia, Jordan, the United States, Britain, France, Canada, Japan, Iran and Syria.American officials said the format of that conference might be a good vehicle for indirect talks with Syria and Iran. Administration officials have been working with the United Nations and the Iraqi government to set up the next meeting of the conference, which is sometimes called the Iraq Compact Group and other times called the International Compact on Iraq.The parties had planned to meet this week in Saudi Arabia, but postponed those plans when Mr. Maliki asked for more time to reach out to Iraq’s neighbors, according to senior Bush administration officials.The question is whether the administration can make the next, yet-unscheduled meeting of the conference substitute for the direct talks with Iran and Syria that many politicians are calling for. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and her deputies have been pointing recently to the forum begun in 2004 as a sign that America and Iran have a channel available to talk whenever they want.“We already have a transparent process we can use to talk to Iran,” Mr. McCormack said. “You know, we have this international forum.”General Caldwell’s discussion at a news conference of the handover of military authority to the Iraqis next year dovetailed with the other main recommendation expected from the Iraq Study Group’s report on Wednesday — that the Americans should steadily reduce the number of combat units in Iraq while increasing the size and number of American training teams embedded with Iraqi units.Senior American commanders in Iraq say that they doubt that many of the Iraqi units will be capable of fighting the Sunni-led insurgency on their own, even after the Iraqi government gets full operational command of the military, but they say that the influx of advisers should strengthen the Iraqi forces. The Iraqis would then be able to take over most of the fighting by the end of 2007, the commanders say.The immense security challenge facing the Iraqi and American forces was highlighted Tuesday by a series of particularly brutal attacks across Baghdad that resulted in at least 54 Iraqis killed and scores wounded.In the deadliest assault, gunmen set off a bomb to stop a bus carrying workers for a government organization that maintains Shiite mosques, then opened fire on the passengers, killing at least 15 people and wounding nine, an Interior Ministry official said. In the Bayaa neighborhood, a triple car bombing near a gas station killed at least 14 people and wounded 25, a hospital official said.The American military said Tuesday that a soldier had been killed and four were wounded by a guerrilla ambush in northeastern Baghdad on Monday, and that a soldier was killed and another wounded by a roadside bomb in Diyala Province on Monday.In pushing for a regional conference, Mr. Maliki appeared to be showing more flexibility in looking for solutions to the violence than either Mr. Talabani, the Iraqi president, or Mr. Hakim, the head of the main Shiite political bloc and a rival of Mr. Maliki’s.Over the weekend, Mr. Talabani and Mr. Hakim had reacted with disdain to Mr. Annan’s suggestion of an international conference on Iraq.Mr. Hakim has very close ties to Iran, ruled by Shiite Persians, and has chafed at the prospect that Sunni Arab countries in the region could get more involved in Iraq. Like many Kurds, Mr. Talabani fears interference in Iraqi affairs by Turkey, which has threatened to invade the autonomous region of Iraqi Kurdistan if the Kurds try to move toward independence or take control of the oil city of Kirkuk.Mr. Maliki is a conservative Shiite, but is believed to be less closely allied to Iran than Mr. Hakim.The different positions staked out by the two Shiite politicians suggested that the White House might not have an easy time getting Mr. Hakim to lend full political support to Mr. Maliki, if that had been one of President Bush’s goals in inviting Mr. Hakim to the White House.In a classified memo written last month, Stephen J. Hadley, the national security adviser, suggested that the Americans could build a new political base for Mr. Maliki by urging Sunni Arab leaders and Shiite politicians, especially Mr. Hakim, to back Mr. Maliki. That would then in theory allow Mr. Maliki to break with Moktada al-Sadr, the anti-American Shiite cleric who is Mr. Maliki’s main political backer.For months, American officials have been urging Mr. Maliki to crack down on Mr. Sadr’s formidable militia, the Mahdi Army, which has been responsible for waves of reprisal killings of Sunni Arabs.'"
"'06-12-06,'0','In spite of the discord, the team is off to a terrific start this season. Lindsey Kildow climbed three podiums in three days last week at the women’s World Cup competition at Lake Louise, Alberta, and Miller won the most hazardous downhill in North America, leading four American men into the top 10 that day at Beaver Creek, Colo. At the awards ceremony, the Americans trotted out in front of the cameras wore uniforms plastered with the corporate logos of sponsors like Visa and Chevrolet that Marolt so successfully hitched to the cause.Miller then flouted the new code, gulping Champagne on the podium to the loud approval of the assembled hardcore racing fans, most of whom stayed ardently loyal to him last year during his fiasco in Turin.Miller arrived at the Olympics as the third-ranked skier in the world but left without a medal in five events. He was criticized for living apart from the team in a motor home during the Games and for appearing at late-night parties during the competition.Under pressure from team supporters, Marolt applied the new rules not just to Miller but to all the more than 150 athletes on the association’s elite teams, including Nordic and freestyle skiers, who sign annual team agreements.The 10-page team agreement, given to team members over the summer, prohibits the drinking of alcohol in the presence of team staff and contains explicit requirements that athletes “shall wear U.S.S.A.-prescribed apparel” when competing or dealing with the news media.Marolt, who was paid an annual salary of $559,880, according to the association’s 2004 tax records, defended the revised rules last week, pointing out that a vast majority of the members of the association were junior racers who looked up to the national team members as role models.“The most important thing you’ve got is the parents and the little kids that come into this thing at the bottom,” Marolt said. “We want those people seeing really positive role models at the top.”Marolt agreed that tension was inevitable when athletes competed as individuals but traveled and trained as a team.“When they stand there in the starting gate looking down the mountain, they are all alone,” he said, “but it took a lot of people working very hard, and a lot of financial contributions, to get them there.”Some of the skiers seized on the apparel clause this summer and said that without more input in team decisions, they would reserve the right to not wear their uniforms.“We didn’t want helicopter rides to the start, or control over all the issues,” said Scott Macartney, a downhiller who helped craft a proposed addendum to the agreement. “We just wanted our input heard. Having a recourse was important.”Team administrators rejected any changes, and the athletes ultimately signed on to the new policies. But members of the men’s team have continued to voice their unhappiness.Some skiers said they feel infantilized by the alcohol rule, and they worry that their coaches — who must enforce the rule — are being set up as scapegoats.Marco Sullivan is a popular member of the downhill team, which operates as a sort of fraternity within the ski team with an initiation ritual that takes place in a rowdy pub in Kitzbühel, Austria.“We’re the ones risking our lives on these downhill courses, and the coaches and athletes are on the road in Europe all winter,” Sullivan said in an interview last week.“We know how to unwind together. We’re a tight family, and for Bill to make that go away has frustrated every one of us.”Other skiers are angry about a requirement that they stay in official team housing, not motor homes. Marolt said allowing athletes to stay on their own eroded team spirit.Ted Ligety, the Olympic combined champion, said he believed that the rules were being implemented to pacify the team’s private donors.“I think some of the trustees kind of freaked out about the Olympics and figured there was something wrong with the team, and this was the response to show them the athletes are on a leash,” Ligety said. “I think it’s a little narrow-sighted when you also want the American public behind you.“This mantra about values is not important to a 12-year-old kid.”Marolt, a former Olympic skier and the athletic director of the University of Colorado from 1984 to 1996, prides himself on his rapport with his athletes, and he was visibly pained last week when responding to the criticism his athletes are taking public.“It’s a work in progress, and we’ve always been a work in progress, and we are worlds ahead of where we were 10 years ago,” he said.“What we’ve come up with is simply designed to create a team environment in accordance with the values that all of our athletes, staff and stakeholders share. It’s a positive effort, pure and simple.”Miller himself has been uncharacteristically diplomatic this season, but he addressed the new rules last week at a sponsor event in Vail, Colo.“Obviously I couldn’t help but notice that that was pretty much addressed toward me,” he said of the motor home policy.“They have to manage the team the way they see fit, and they get to make those kinds of decisions, so I’m sort of out there at their mercy.”Miller is planning to travel on the tour with a motor home again this season in Europe, as is Julia Mancuso, who won a gold medal in Turin in the women’s giant slalom.The extent to which Marolt enforces the new guidelines is not yet clear, and he seems open to more criticism whether he takes a hard line or a soft one.“It’s now a bigger fish bowl, with much broader exposure,” said Scherr, who says the controversy reflects the growing pains that winter sports are undergoing since the Salt Lake Games in 2002 boosted their popularity. “You’ll see both the national governing bodies adjusting to that, and athletes adjusting to that, and I think Torino was an adjustment to that.”'"
"'06-12-06,'0','What was happening is what happens every year at Major League Baseball’s winter meetings: Boras was talking about his marquee players, and reporters were listening.Boras told Drew there would be a strong market for him if he opted out of the final three years and $33 million left on his deal with the Dodgers. Drew did, and more than doubled his future pay days. Last year the Red Sox would not budge past a four-year, $40 million deal for center fielder Johnny Damon, but they lavished nearly twice that amount on Drew.Even though Drew is a talented player who batted .283 with 20 homers, 100 runs batted in and a .393 on-base percentage last season, he has played in less than 110 games four times in the last eight years, and his desire has been questioned.“If a player plays well, the market will respond to him,” Boras said. “I think the fans in Boston are going to appreciate his style of play.”Boras gushed about a lineup that, for now, includes Drew, David Ortiz and Manny Ramírez. Ramírez has been the subject of trade speculation, but Boras said he thought it would be too complicated for the Red Sox to deal Ramírez.The Red Sox and Boras have until midnight Dec. 14, which is the end of a 30-day window, to agree to a contract for Matsuzaka. While Boras called Matsuzaka “a franchise pitcher” and believes he deserves $11 million to $12 million a year, the Red Sox believe their hefty posting price and the fact that Matsuzaka is not a free agent mean he should earn less.The negotiations are between Boras and the Red Sox, but Boras said there needed to be a “cooperative effort from three parties,” a reference to the Seibu Lions, the team Matsuzaka has pitched for in Japan. When a reporter asked Boras if the Lions could give Matsuzaka a parting gift, which would be a way for him to share in the posting fee, Boras said there was no rule against such a gesture.“We’re making every good-faith effort to examine it from a lot of sides to see if there is a way to accomplish something that is fair for all sides,” Boras said.Boras said Matsuzaka would play in the majors, but that it was impossible to predict when it might happen. That seemed to be Boras’s way of hinting that Matsuzaka could return to Japan if an agreement was not made, but Matsuzaka has told Boras that he does not want to go back.A Canadian reporter asked Boras about Eric Gagne, the Canadian closer who had back surgery last season. Boras said Gagne, who is throwing off flat ground, might sign this week. The Dodgers, Gagne’s former team, the Red Sox, the Cleveland Indians, the Texas Rangers and the Toronto Blue Jays are interested in Gagne.“It doesn’t hurt to have a hockey town involved,” Boras said, playing to the Canadian audience while once again playing to an audience at these meetings.The Associated Press reported that the Red Sox reached an agreement with shortstop Julio Lugo on a four-year, $36 million deal. ... Bernie Williams is still unsure if he will play next season. Scott Boras, Williams’s agent, said he would wait until the Yankees have made more decisions before speaking to General Manager Brian Cashman about whether Williams fits into their plans. ... Cal Ripken Jr., the former Orioles star who is on the Hall of Fame ballot for the first time, was asked if he thought that Mark McGwire, who is also on the ballot for the first time, should be elected to the Hall. “I understand the interest,” Ripken said. “I understand the debate that’s going on. I personally look at it and I don’t want to be drawn into it.”'"
"'06-12-06,'0','But state health officials in the region insisted that the outbreak had been contained and that the most recent cases represented late notifications of the illness, not new incidences. The number of cases of infection could continue to rise as people come forward to report their illness.As the number of people reportedly infected rose to 65 from 39 on Monday, the national president of Taco Bell, Greg Creed, said that while the popular fast food chain had been implicated in the outbreak, its food has not yet been definitely identified as the cause.“Neither the health department nor we know what caused it,” said Mr. Creed, who was in New York for a previously scheduled shareholders’ meeting. “Not everybody that got sick ate at Taco Bell.”Although a number of the people who were reported ill did not eat at Taco Bell, David Daigle, a spokesman for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said investigators were “comfortable” identifying Taco Bell as the source of the infected food.It was not clear, however, whether it was produce like lettuce or cooked ingredients like ground beef that may have caused the infections. Still Taco Bell officials said the restaurants in question had thrown out all the food they had in stock.Taco Bell reopened eight restaurants on Long Island that the company had closed for a day after they were linked to the outbreak. The restaurant in South Plainfield, N.J., where 19 persons who were sickened ate in the weeks before and after Thanksgiving, remained closed as Taco Bell, working with public health authorities in Middlesex County, worked to sanitize all the fixtures, including utensils and cooking equipment.As the investigations continued, one additional case — an adult who has been hospitalized for two weeks after eating at a Taco Bell in Seaford — was reported on Long Island yesterday. Of the 11 patients in Suffolk County, 9 have been released from the hospital, officials said. And in New Jersey, where two children had developed kidney damage, an 11-year-old boy was moved from intensive care to the pediatric unit at Beth Israel Medical Center in Newark.Dr. Patricia Dillon, director of epidemiology and communicable diseases for Suffolk County, said that for now, health authorities were focusing on the central food distributor rather than improper handling in the restaurants as the source of the contamination.“You could not have improper handling occur at so many restaurants,” Dr. Dillon said.Taco Bell confirmed yesterday that all of the beef, lettuce and other ingredients prepared at the 1,100 Taco Bells in the Northeast came from the distribution center in South Jersey, which is operated by McLane Food Service of Carrollton, Tex.Bart McKay, associate general counsel for McLane, said in a telephone interview that the company had been called into the investigation by Taco Bell’s parent company, Yum! Brands.Yesterday, New Jersey health officials, along with investigators from the Food and Drug Administration, inspected the 192,000-square-foot warehouse operated by McLane.Taco Bell restaurants typically serve 5,000 to 7,000 customers a week. Mr. McKay said that each one could receive two or three deliveries a week, and that its entire inventory could be replaced within a little more than a week.“If they’re running their operation at premium efficiency, they don’t have a lot of stuff laying around for a long time,” Mr. McKay said.That quick turnover is causing problems for medical investigators who are trying to find samples to test to determine what, if anything, in the restaurants might have caused the E coli infections.Investigators will have to work their way back through purchase and delivery records to find the source of the food, officials said.It could be a lengthy process, and one likely to raise more concerns about the apparent delay by officials in notifying the public of the outbreak.“I find it weird that the health department waited one or two weeks,” said Victor Bastardo, 34, who was eating at a Taco Bell in Yonkers Tuesday afternoon. “How could they do that, since people eat there with their kids?”Under standard protocol for reporting disease in New York and New Jersey, confirmed cases of E. coli must be reported within 24 hours to local health authorities.When the number of cases rises to an exceptional level, or if there are cases in neighboring counties, state health officials are notified, and they in turn notify surrounding states. Moreover, in the case of adjoining states, reports are sent to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which is coordinating this investigation.At the Yum! Brands shareholders’ meeting in New York yesterday, the E. coli outbreak was mentioned only briefly before the talk turned to financial matters, including Taco Bell’s plans to expand internationally next year. Despite the current troubles, the stock of Yum! Brands rose 2.6 percent Tuesday, closing at $63.26.Still, the local restaurant operators said they were concerned about the effects of the outbreak on business, and several that reopened yesterday reported that business was way off.“We’re losing money for no reason,” said Sam Ahmed, manager of a Taco Bell in the Roosevelt Field mall on Long Island, which reopened yesterday afternoon after an inspection by county health officials.“Nobody found anything and nobody proved anything,” Mr. Ahmed said. “It’s just an assumption.”'"
"'06-12-06,'0','Eleanor Thomas Elliott, an advocate for women’s rights who successfully fought Columbia University’s attempt to take over Barnard College in the early 1970s, died Sunday in Valhalla, N.Y. She was 80 and lived in Cross River, N.Y.The cause was injuries from a car accident, said her brother-in-law, Osborn Elliott, the former editor of Newsweek and a former dean of the Columbia Graduate School of Journalism.Ms. Elliott was chairwoman of the board at Barnard when she helped organize administrators, faculty members and students there to oppose a Columbia merger. “If she hadn’t held the line, it might well have gone the other way,” said Helene Kaplan, a board member at the time and its chairwoman in the 1980s. “Elly believed that Barnard offered something special for young women that could not be duplicated in a merged institution.”Barnard, a women’s college, is affiliated with its neighbor Columbia in Manhattan but maintains its independence.Ms. Elliott led the Barnard board from 1973 to 1976. She was also a former board member of the National Organization for Women’s Legal Defense and Education Fund. During the Reagan administration, she served on the National Advisory Council on Women’s Educational Programs. “She was a bridge for feminism into many traditional places,” said the feminist leader Gloria Steinem, a friend.In the early 1990s, Ms. Elliott was chairwoman of the Woodrow Wilson National Fellowship Foundation in Princeton, N.J., which promotes excellence in teaching, the humanities and women’s studies.'"
"'06-12-06,'0','Following are excerpts from the opening statement and testimony under questioning of Robert M. Gates, President Bush’s nominee to be defense secretary, in an appearance yesterday before the Senate Armed Services Committee, as transcribed by the Federal News Service. Mr. Gates spoke at length about the regional implications of the course of events in Iraq.While I am open to alternative ideas about our future strategy and tactics in Iraq, I feel quite strongly about one point: developments in Iraq over the next year or two will, I believe, shape the entire Middle East and greatly influence global geopolitics for many years to come. Our course over the next year or two will determine whether the American and Iraqi people, and the next president of the United States, will face a slowly but steadily improving situation in Iraq and in the region, or will face the very real risk, and possible reality, of a regional conflagration. We need to work together to develop a strategy that does not leave Iraq in chaos, and that protects our long-term interests in and hopes for the region....It seems to me that the United States is going to have to have some presence in Iraq for a long time. The Iraqi forces clearly have no logistical capability of their own. They have no air power of their own. So the United States clearly even if our — if whatever changed approach or strategy we come up with, the president implements, works, we are still going to have to have some level of American support there for the Iraqi military and that could take quite some time, but it could be with a dramatically smaller number of U.S. forces than are there today....I think that military action against Iran would be an absolute last resort; that any problems that we have with Iran, our first option should be diplomacy and working with our allies to try and deal with the problems that Iran is posing to us. I think that we have seen in Iraq that once war is unleashed, it becomes unpredictable. And I think that the consequences of a conflict — a military conflict with Iran could be quite dramatic. And therefore, I would counsel against military action, except as a last resort and if we felt that our vital interests were threatened. ...It’s always awkward to talk about hypotheticals in this case, but I think that while Iran cannot attack us directly militarily, I think that their capacity to potentially close off the Persian Gulf to all exports of oil, their potential to unleash a significant wave of terror both in the — well, in the Middle East and in Europe and even here in this country is very real. They are certainly not being helpful in Iraq and are doing us — I think doing damage to our interests there, but I think they could do a lot more to hurt our effort in Iraq.'"
"'06-12-06,'0','WASHINGTON, Dec. 5 — The Bush administration withdrew a plan on Tuesday to give European airlines more freedom to invest in American airlines and to participate in management decisions, bowing to opposition expected to deepen in a Democratic-controlled Congress.The decision deals a blow to greater cooperation between United States and European airlines. Europe had made the investor rule a condition for putting in place the so-called open skies treaty with the United States, which is needed to allow airlines based in Europe or the United States to fly with little or no restrictions to each other’s territories. Such flights are now often subject to government-to-government negotiations.The open skies treaty, which has been agreed to by the United States and the European Union, is far more important on both sides of the Atlantic than the separate foreign ownership rule. Europe could easily allow the open skies treaty to take effect at any time, but it has made such an issue of tying the two together that it now faces embarrassment if it appears to give in.Yet Tuesday’s development is probably not the end of the negotiations that govern international air accords, said Mary Peters, the transportation secretary, whose agency issued the ruling.“Today’s announcement in no way deters us from our goal of giving U.S. airlines complete access to the world’s capital markets,” Ms. Peters said. She added that the government “was eager to work with Congress and the aviation industry to find new ways to make it easier for airlines to raise money from global investors.”'"
"'06-12-06,'0','Like his life, Mr. Apple’s memorial was a feast, with dishes donated by 20 of the Washington area’s most celebrated chefs. The oysters came from Patrick O’Connell of the Inn at Little Washington, and they were not only decadent — some had sparkly tiaras of caviar — but also plentiful.Mr. O’Connell said he had initially planned to bring 300, then tripled the count. Mr. Apple, he acknowledged, could never get enough of the good things in life.Much about the memorial — those presidential tributes; the crush of star columnists and broadcast stars; a slide show that caught Mr. Apple in exotic locales and exalted company — spoke to his four prolific decades covering the most important campaigns, elections and wars of his time. He was a legend in the business he loved.But the memorial was really a testament to Mr. Apple’s prodigious appetites, which could never be confined to one area of interest, one axis of influence. He wrote about food with as much gusto and distinction as he wrote about politics. He was a man who traversed and collapsed many worlds — journalistic, diplomatic, gastronomic — and the lineup of figures who eulogized him underscored that.They included a former British foreign secretary (Lord David Owen), a leading American senator (John McCain), one of the most influential chefs of the past 50 years (Alice Waters) and arguably the wittiest food writer of the last 25 (Calvin Trillin).Mr. Trillin, in his remarks, remembered Mr. Apple’s 70th birthday, for which dozens of friends gathered in Paris at Chez L’Ami Louis, “where the food is so rich that one invited guest was unable to make the trip because of what he later described as an anticipatory heart attack.”Everything Mr. Apple did, Mr. Trillin noted, was outsize.“The Apple story is now a sub-genre of journalistic war stories,” he said. “In an Apple story, certain verbs are customary. Apple does not enter a hotel in Beirut or a restaurant in London; he sweeps in. At the end of a long dinner, Apple doesn’t talk or even pontificate; he holds forth. In either case he is, as Tom Brokaw once put it, ‘in full Apple.’ ”Mr. Trillin spoke to a diverse crowd of people in a spacious theater where the plush red chairs, recognizable faces and craned necks brought to mind a starry awards ceremony as much as a teary remembrance.After the speeches and slide show, those people retreated to one of the center’s banquet halls, where servers carried gleaming trays with glasses of fumé blanc and chardonnay, petite sirah and cabernet sauvignon, all courtesy of more than a dozen California wine producers who had come to know and nourish Mr. Apple over the years.Those producers donated more than 50 cases of wine in all.

The singer James Taylor was seen introducing himself to Mr. Trillin. Benjamin C. Bradlee, former executive editor of The Washington Post, was overheard bantering with Art Buchwald.It was unclear whether the event would have been covered most fittingly by Congressional Quarterly, The Columbia Journalism Review, Food & Wine magazine or Us Weekly. C-Span was on hand to videotape it all.“I’ve never been at anything like this for a journalist,” said David S. Broder, the veteran Washington Post political reporter. “The only thing that comes to mind is when Katharine Graham died.”Ms. Graham, the owner and publisher of The Post, was mourned by thousands of people at the Washington National Cathedral in 2001.For Mr. Apple, politics and food always mingled.“With Johnny, you could never be sure whether C.I.A. meant Central Intelligence Agency or Culinary Institute of America,” said the journalist Todd S.

As many speakers noted, his love for “my wife, Betsey,” could not be contained. Like so much about Mr. Apple, it was larger than large.“How can I sum him up?” Lord Owen asked rhetorically. “Johnny was a truly rounded man.”'"
"'06-12-06,'0','In a long-awaited analysis, health officials reported yesterday that antidepressant medications appeared to increase significantly the risk of suicide attempts and related behaviors in adults under 25, while reducing such risks in older people.The analysis, the most comprehensive and rigorous to date, found that suicidal behavior of any kind was rare, and that people taking the medications were no more likely to kill themselves than those taking placebo pills. But adults under 25 taking the drugs were more than twice as likely as those on placebos to report a suicide attempt, or to prepare for one by, say, writing a suicide note.The report, which included more than a dozen medications, was compiled by the Food and Drug Administration and posted on its Web site.The findings are the latest chapter in a yearslong debate that has recently focused on children and adolescents. In 2004, after doing a similar analysis, the F.D.A. required drug makers to include on their labels prominent warnings that the drugs were associated with an increased risk of suicidal thinking and behavior in minors. The new study is likely to shift the same attention to young adults, experts said, and may encourage patient advocates who believe that antidepressants like Prozac have hidden dangers, and psychiatrists who insist that the medications are safe.Dr. Kelly Posner, an assistant professor of child psychiatry at Columbia, who helped the F.D.A. analyze the data, said the findings should be treated with caution, because the drug trials studied were not designed to evaluate suicide risk.'"
"'06-12-06,'0','Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg opened an emergency operations center yesterday to replace the one in 7 World Trade Center that was destroyed on 9/11. Creating the center, at 165 Cadman Plaza East, involved a $50 million federally financed renovation of a building once used by the American Red Cross. The four-story, 65,000-square-foot building, which will serve as the headquarters of the Office of Emergency Management, has a center for representatives of 130 agencies who will gather during emergencies; a press briefing room; and conference rooms. The building was designed to be environmentally sensitive, with columns and floors reused from the old building, heat-reflecting roof tiles and water-saving bathroom fixtures.'"
"'06-12-06,'0','The investigators also recently determined that the agency gave at least $3 million to more than 500 foreign students or other foreigners in the United States on work visas even though federal law specifically prohibits such aid.“FEMA has much work to do before we can be confident that it is providing assistance to those who are eligible and who need it, while denying it to those who do not,” said Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut. Mr. Lieberman is the ranking Democrat on the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, which has scheduled a hearing for Wednesday on Hurricane Katrina-related fraud and abuse.The agency’s officials on Tuesday said they had not yet seen the new report and would not comment in detail until they had. But they acknowledged the serious flaws in distribution of financial aid after the hurricanes. A copy of the report was given to The New York Times.“The stringent controls instituted this past year by FEMA will dramatically improve safeguards and help eliminate processing errors and fraudulent abuse,” Pat Philbin, an agency spokesman, said in a written statement.But the Government Accountability Office report made it clear that the inappropriate payments continued into this year. For example, 10 residents of an apartment complex in Plano, Tex., collected $46,000 in rental assistance from FEMA through June, even though the City of Plano was paying their rent, with money from the federal agency.FEMA estimates that of the $7 billion in emergency aid given out to individuals and families after Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, about $290 million was unjustified. But based on more than a year of spot-checking applications, Congressional auditors said they believed the federal agency was grossly underestimating the figure, and that a more accurate amount would be at least $1 billion.That would include money that went to thousands of inmates and people who used falsified Social Security numbers or submitted applications for phantom homes, all cases turned up by the investigators.FEMA has recouped about $7.5 million of these inappropriate payments, an agency official said Tuesday, and he estimated that an additional $8.1 million was on the way.Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, chairwoman of the Homeland Security Committee, said the small percentage of money recouped showed how important it was for the agency to improve how it screened applications for disaster aid.“Once the money is out the door, it is very difficult for it to be recovered,” Ms. Collins said.At the time Hurricanes Katrina and Rita hit, the agency had systems in place to prevent fraud, including a computer program that looked for applications with the same Social Security number. But officials said they turned the system off, claiming that they were worried it might prevent legitimate victims from getting help, the report said.That is why, for example, the 7,600 individuals had been able to collect $20 million in emergency aid for properties supposedly hit by both storms, the report said.Ms. Collins said she did not accept the assertion that the agency could not figure out how to distribute emergency assistance quickly while preventing widespread waste and fraud.'"
"'06-12-06,'0','Other athletes who enrolled at University High remain in college but have also run into problems. Demetrice Morley, widely considered the top recruit in Florida two years ago, is a starting safety at the University of Tennessee. He was suspended for the first half of the South Carolina game in October for “not taking academics as seriously as he should, for missing class and not telling me the truth,” Coach Phillip Fulmer said in a statement.Damaso Munoz, a redshirt freshman linebacker at Rutgers, has mostly watched the Scarlet Knights’ magical season from the sideline. Munoz took seven and a half credits in four months at University High, more than half the required amount for an entire high school career, according to documents obtained by The Times. He struggled to get through the N.C.A.A. Clearinghouse last year after problems with his transcript surfaced, and he has played sparingly this season.Philip Simpson, a redshirt sophomore defensive lineman at Temple, missed last season because of academic issues and has also been suspended for a few games this season. Increased academic support for athletes at Temple has helped Simpson become more self-sufficient in the classroom.“Is he doing better?” said Peter D’Alonzo, the lead coordinator and a learning specialist at Temple. “Yes. He’s doing well.”Tavares Kendrick has a lot of raw ability, according to his coaches, and he desperately wants to play pro football to help out his large family. But he has held academics in little regard at the four schools he has attended since 2004, slowing his progress on the field partly because of a lack of game experience.At Florida International, he said, he and his teammates would often swipe their ID cards to sign in for their 10 hours of mandatory study hall every week, then immediately leave. He said he struggled to manage his time and to wake up for class.His attitude carried over from high school, where he had poor attendance and said he spent many school days in the gym shooting baskets. Still, he said, he passed the mandatory high school exit exam in Florida, known as the FCAT.“Out of all of us that went to University High, out of the whole group, I was the only one to pass the FCAT,” he said. “I passed both parts. The only thing was that my grades was just poor. As far as smarts, that wasn’t no problem.”He said his classroom performance, and the academic support, improved in his second year at Florida International. But Kendrick recalled that when he met with Coach Don Strock to say that he would transfer to another college this spring, Strock told him he was close to failing out of school.Kendrick went to El Camino College in Torrance, on the outskirts of Los Angeles, where he said he paid $100 a month to live with five others from the Miami area in a one-bedroom apartment near the school. He said he slept on a futon, lived on noodles and received $50 or $60 a week from his family.“It was way worse out there,” he said. “And I’m from the ghetto.”John Featherstone, the El Camino coach, said Kendrick left in early October before he received any grades from the first part of his first semester there. He said Kendrick seemed capable of college work; he needed to pass a summer course at El Camino to qualify to play this fall.“He’s like a lot of kids,” Featherstone said. “They don’t seem to garner an appreciation for academics in high school, and unfortunately they get passed through the system. Then they come to college, and it’s even harder.”While Kendrick said financial problems and a sick friend brought him back to Miami, Featherstone said Kendrick was no longer on the team because he broke the same rule twice. Featherstone said he encouraged Kendrick to stay and attempt to get his associate’s degree.Kendrick’s statistics were unimpressive in his four starts at El Camino. He completed 53.9 percent of his passes, throwing six touchdown passes and four interceptions.Much as he did at Florida International, Kendrick struggled to grasp the offense at El Camino. But he said he hoped to get a workout with the San Francisco 49ers because of his familiarity with the West Coast offense.“If he can’t start for us, he’s going to struggle at the next level,” Featherstone said.Despite his mediocre showing, Kendrick had the phone turned back on at his father’s house, where he lives, in case any scouts called.“I’m going to get an agent and make it happen,” he said. “I know for a fact I’m better than a lot of guys in the N.F.L. right now.”Just making it to college is an accomplishment for young people from this part of Miami, so much so that many see playing college sports and getting a shot at professional sports as one of the few ways out of poverty. There are plenty of N.F.L. success stories from Kendrick’s neighborhood, the latest being Antrel Rolle, a cornerback for the Arizona Cardinals, but there are many more stories of squandered talent.Kendrick’s Pop Warner coach, Maurice Alexander, said that only 30 percent or 40 percent of the athletes with the talent to play college football actually make it to campus. “And only about half of them stay to get their degree,” Alexander said.Kendrick’s parents are unemployed. His mother, Connie Kendrick, said she never had a chance to finish her education because she had to work in the tomato and bean fields. His father, Willie Woodley, lost his lawn-care job in the Florida Keys about a year ago.Kendrick said he took his job with American Airlines to support his family and to pay for a cellphone and trips around the country to work out for N.F.L. teams. He is one of four children, and his older sister, LaToya Kendrick, who is 24 and lives with Kendrick’s mother and grandmother in a tiny house, has seven children.Kendrick’s mother would like him to return to college to take advantage of an opportunity she never had. But in a long interview, Kendrick spoke mostly of pro football.As he traveled through his neighborhood, pointing out the old drug houses in front of which he played touch football, he visualized that documentary ending with him in an N.F.L. uniform. That, not a college degree, is what he wants most.“School,” he said, “is always going to be there.”'"

"'06-12-07,'0','The isotope, polonium 210, has left a tantalizing though inconclusive trail that investigators have traced throughout London and, through two British Airways planes, into Moscow.Until Wednesday the British police adopted a circumspect approach to Mr. Litvinenko’s death, calling it “unusual” or “suspicious” even as evidence mounted that he had died of radiation poisoning as a result of ingesting polonium 210.But in a statement on Wednesday night, Scotland Yard said: “Detectives investigating the death of Alexander Litvinenko have reached the stage where it is felt appropriate to treat it as an allegation of murder.“It is important to stress that we have reached no conclusions as to the means employed, the motive or the identity of those who might be responsible for Mr. Litvinenko’s death. The inquiry is still in its early stages, and we are not prepared to comment on speculative reports in the media.”The timing of the announcement suggested that the British police were seeking to reinforce demands for cooperation from the Kremlin by stressing the gravity of the case. Mr. Lugovoi, at his own initiative, met with Britain’s deputy ambassador, Sian MacLeod, on the day Mr. Litvinenko died.Britain’s Health Protection Agency confirmed that minute traces of radiation had been found at Emirates Stadium in London, the newly built home of the Arsenal soccer team, where Mr. Kovtun and Mr. Lugovoi say they attended a soccer match on the night of Nov. 1.An embassy spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity, according to British policy, said there were minute traces of a radioactive element, which he declined to identify as polonium, found there. He said there was no public health threat.The new discoveries — especially in the Moscow embassy — appeared to suggest the possibility that Mr. Lugovoi had been exposed to polonium, though how and exactly when remain inconclusive. He is now hospitalized in Moscow, as is Mr. Kovtun.Whether tests have found traces of polonium on Mr. Lugovoi and Mr. Kovtun remains unclear; Mr. Lugovoi has said that checks so far have found nothing.The joint British-Russian questioning of the Russian businessman appeared to signal Russia’s willingness to cooperate with an investigation that has sorely strained relations.A day before, the prosecutor general, Yuri Y. Chaika, pointedly outlined the limits of any British investigatory authority here. He said that Russian investigators would take the lead and that Russia would refuse to extradite anyone charged with involvement in Mr. Litvinenko’s death, trying them instead in a Russian court.Mr. Kovtun was questioned on Tuesday evening and again on Wednesday in a Moscow hospital, where doctors were examining him and Mr. Lugovoi for exposure to polonium 210, according to Mr. Lugovoi’s lawyer.By Wednesday evening, investigators had not yet questioned Mr. Lugovoi, who checked into the hospital as the British arrived in Moscow this week, said the lawyer, Andrei M. Romashov, according to a report on Interfax.A third businessman who traveled with the two men to London, Vyacheslav G. Sokolenko, said in a telephone interview that Mr. Lugovoi and Mr. Kovtun had willingly agreed to meet with the British detectives, adding that all three had nothing to hide. “We never concealed the truth,” he said, speaking of their visit to London.Mr. Sokolenko said he did not attend the meeting with Mr. Litvinenko on Nov. 1. He said he had traveled with Mr. Lugovoi and his family, along with Mr. Kovtun, to attend the Nov. 1 soccer match, between CSKA Moscow and Arsenal.Mr. Lugovoi, who has declined repeated requests for an interview, said in a radio interview shortly after Mr. Litvinenko’s death that he and Mr. Kovtun had met him to discuss establishing contacts for British companies seeking to invest or locate in Russia.Mario Scaramella, who met Mr. Litvinenko at a sushi restaurant that day, left a hospital in London on Wednesday after checking in last Friday for tests after the discovery of traces of polonium in his body. Doctors found no signs of radiation illness.In an interview with CNN on Wednesday, Mr. Scaramella said he had met Mr. Litvinenko to discuss threats he had received. “Once here, I received more details about this risk, this danger,” he said from his hospital room. “So we met up as scheduled just to update each other about security issues, our personal security.”Mr. Scaramella, an academic who worked on an Italian commission investigating Soviet and Russian espionage and secret service activity in Italy, said he had received e-mail from an unidentified source suggesting that he and Mr. Litvinenko were in danger from “people linked with some clandestine organizations not directly under control of Russian establishment but from Russia.”At the same time, he discounted the threats, saying the messages had been so full of detail that they “didn’t seem genuine,” a view he said Mr. Litvinenko shared.In London, Alex Goldfarb, an associate of the billionaire Russian émigré Boris A. Berezovsky and a spokesman for the Litvinenko family, said he believed that Mr. Lugovoi was central to the investigation, because he had flown into London on the British Airways flights that later showed traces of radiation, including at least one flight that occurred before Nov. 1.Mr. Goldfarb said that sequence of events suggested that Mr. Lugovoi “was showing radiation before Alexander was contaminated.” At the same time, he suggested that Mr. Lugovoi might have been an unwilling participant in the poisoning.“He is the one who Alex trusted, so he may have been involved himself,” Mr. Goldfarb said, “or he was used to bring somebody else close to him.”'"
"'06-12-07,'0','OTTAWA, Dec. 6 — The commissioner of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police resigned Wednesday, making him the first official to face penalties because of the deportation of a Canadian citizen to Syria, where he was jailed and tortured because he was suspected of being a terrorist.The resignation of the commissioner, Giuliano Zaccardelli, was announced in a terse statement from Prime Minster Stephen Harper in the House of Commons.Previously, Mr. Harper’s government supported the commissioner despite repeated calls from opposition politicians and human rights groups for Mr. Zaccardelli’s removal.Those demands began in September after a commission of inquiry declared that the deported man, Maher Arar, who holds dual Canadian-Syrian citizenship, was innocent and that it was likely that he was deported to Syria by American officials (after he tried to change planes in New York) because of false information they had received from the Mounted Police.In a speech he made in Toronto on Monday, and in a parliamentary committee hearing in Ottawa the next day, Mr. Zaccardelli admitted that his earlier testimony about how he handled the Arar affair had been incorrect.'"
"'06-12-07,'0','WASHINGTON, Dec. 6 (Reuters) — Government payments for an anemia drug used to treat kidney dialysis patients encourage overuse that is wasteful, costly and raises the risk of heart complications, specialists testified Wednesday before Congress.The Medicare insurance program for the elderly and disabled pays for the anemia drug, Epogen by Amgen, at the average sales price plus a 6 percent premium. Payment for kidney dialysis is separate.“This is a recipe for disaster,” said Dennis J. Cotter, head of the research group Medical Technology and Practice Patterns Institute Inc., saying it allowed the drug payments to become a revenue stream for providers.Instead, Medicare should lump the price of anemia drugs with overall payments for kidney dialysis services, Mr. Cotter and other specialists told the House Ways and Means Committee. Increasing the dialysis portion of bundled payments would encourage doctors to use only enough of the drug to help patients, without losing money.Congress called for payment changes under the Medicare Modernization Act in 2003. The agency said it had begun research but had not yet acted.'"
"'06-12-07,'0','“There are two very real reasons to buy business gifts that are not necessarily warm and fuzzy,” Ms. Ingram said. “One is obviously to thank someone for their business for the year. The other is to make sure you remain top of mind, and to get your name in front.”Because it is not always easy to buy something for everyone you do business with, you can get better results if you settle on your budget and recipient list simultaneously, and work from there, Ms. Ingram said. Recipients can include clients, vendors, lenders, tenants and media contacts.Liz Morrill, the founder and chief executive of the New York-based beverage company Fizzy Lizzy, said she made her holiday list by taking into account several variables including revenue generated and buzz potential.“Our list isn’t 100 percent scientific. It’s usually a combination of our best customers combined with the people we want to thank who aren’t our customers — advisory board members, wholesalers and distributors,” said Ms. Morrill, who this year picked a beverage-themed cocktail table book to send out.For some companies, deciding on the dollar amount is the easy part. Picking gifts is much harder. Executives at Ervin & Smith Advertising in Omaha call on the firm’s 34 employees to help them decide what to buy. Each year the company runs a gift-giving contest. Employees, armed with a budget, must come up with their most unique ideas. The winning idea will be sent to each of the company’s more than 175 clients.“We see our choice of gift as a way to show off our talents and skills as an agency as well as saying thank you to our clients,” explained Kristin Petrick, the company’s director for public relations. Last year, the company bought gasoline gift certificates. This year, they came up with a “gift to regift” idea, in which recipients were given one silly gift (like a tie) and one good one (like a gift card). The company spends $15 to $100 on gifts, she said.Ervin & Smith may be on to something, said Eugene H. Fram, the J. Warren McClure research professor of marketing at Rochester Institute of Technology in New York. Customers are more likely to remember unique gifts, especially those that show them you are familiar with what they do or care about, Mr. Fram said.“You want your gift to show your customer that you know them and their needs very well,” he said. “You ought to know what your best clients had for breakfast, and your gift should communicate that.” This is why you should be careful about sending group gifts, which often end up sitting in a company’s conference room sans card or sender information. They may not be personal enough and chances are, they will come across anonymous. Gift cards fall into that category, too, since they lack personalization. Many companies don’t allow employees to accept them, either, so there is a good chance they will wind up coming back to you.Marty Kotis, president and chief executive of Kotis Properties of Greensboro, N.C., used to send gift cards, but said people often sent them back. Mr. Kotis, who spends an average of $80 to $120 a person, currently gives customers bottles of expensive wine and Champagne that sport his company’s name and his signature.“We write ‘Happy Holidays’ in gold or silver ink on the label,” he said. “We want people to experience our gifts when they are having a good time on their own. It helps create a good mental image of us.”Charitable donations can be just as thorny. Your customer may not support the same cause that you do. If you decide on this option, let your customer choose his or her own charity, he said.“Get in touch with them and tell them you’re not making a sales call, you’re calling to find out what their favorite local charity is,” Mr. Fram explained. “Go for the local angle so you show that you care about your community.”And keep in mind that when you send is as important as what you send, Ms. Ingram said. Those who send on the wrong day might just as well send nothing, she said. Ms. Ingram suggests sending gifts right after Thanksgiving, or waiting to send them after the holidays. “In a lot of industries between Christmas and New Year’s no one is around,” she said. “You don’t want to send a box of chocolates to someone and have it sit around for two weeks.”'"
"'06-12-07,'0','The drug maker Merck & Company yesterday maintained its forecast of flat earnings for 2006 and it forecast slightly higher 2007 results as it grapples with generic competition.“Merck didn’t say anything really surprising or out of whack, but some people may be disappointed the 2007 forecast didn’t match some more-bullish estimates,” said Shaojing Tong, an analyst at Mehta Partners.Merck, which is to meet next week with analysts to review its pipeline of experimental medicines, expects 2007 earnings of $2.51 to $2.59 a share, excluding charges related to plant closings and job cuts.The forecast squares with the $2.56 average of analysts polled by Reuters Estimates.A Deutsche Bank analyst, Barbara Ryan, said she thought Merck had issued a conservative 2007 forecast that would probably be raised during the year, just as the company repeatedly raised its 2006 outlook.Ms. Ryan stuck to her buy rating on the stock.Merck is counting on its new products to offset the plunging sales of the cholesterol fighter Zocor, which was its best-selling product before its United States patent lapsed last summer.

But Turkish officials say they cannot act until an international embargo that has been in place on the Turkish part of the island for more than 20 years is lifted.”There is no embargo. Turkish Cypriots’ lack of access to the world is self-inflicted and results from the Turkish invasion and occupation and Turkey’s refusal to comply with United Nations resolutions, established rules and the decisions of international courts.Instead, Turkey tries, against any notion of morality or legality, to project the occupied part as Turkish and a separate entity.Turkey will not become a member of the European Union merely because it is important.

"'06-12-07,'0','“It’s a question we ask ourselves all the time,” said Mary Darling, one of the show’s three executive producers and an American who has lived in Canada for the last decade. “If 9/11 is still too raw, it might not work,” she said.There is the other side of that coin too — what will Muslims think? — which the show’s creators usually summarize in one long sentence that mentions the uproar prompted by Salman Rushdie as well as the Danish cartoons about the Prophet Muhammad.This concern stems from the almost automatic presumption that “to look at Muslims in an entertaining way is going to be controversial because they will riot in the streets,” said Al Rae, one of the show’s writers, who noted that he does research by bouncing potential scenarios off cab drivers here. Or as Amaar, the young man detained in the opening airport scene, puts it sardonically, “Muslims all over the world are known for their sense of humor.”The strongest insurance against outrage from the faithful is that “Little Mosque” is the brainchild of Zarqa Nawaz, a Canadian Muslim of Pakistani origin whose own assimilation, particularly after she left Toronto for Regina, Saskatchewan, 10 years ago, provides much of the comic fodder.“It rests on my shoulders to get the balance right between entertainment and representing the community in a reasonable way,” Ms. Nawaz, a 39-year-old mother of four, said in an interview here. “You have to push the boundaries so you can grow and evolve as a community.”During one recent episode being filmed at a neighborhood swimming pool, two Muslim characters who are normally veiled leave the changing room to discover that a man has replaced their usual female instructor. The horrified women lunge for bath towels to use as temporary hijabs, or veils, to cover their hair.Ms. Nawaz, veiled since she was in ninth grade, coached both actresses to be less relaxed. “I didn’t feel that they were panicked enough,” she said. “It’s a big deal for a hijab-wearing woman to be seen without one.”Ultimately the solution is found when, as the script describes, “Fatima comes out dressed in the Haz-Mat Islamic swimsuit.” The costume designer unearthed a swimsuit on the Internet from Jordan that covers her from scalp to ankle and had it shipped to Canada.The struggle over what constitutes modest dress is central to the show. When a Muslim girl flounces into her immigrant father’s presence with her navel showing, he recoils in horror, saying, “You look like a Protestant.”She counters, “Dad, you mean a prostitute?”Ms. Nawaz’s humor also emerges in the pool episode. Johnny, the male water aerobics instructor, is gay, and he pointedly says that the sight of the women’s hair would not be the least bit arousing.“I always try to start these debates in my community like: Does gay count? Do you have to cover your hair in front of a gay man?” Ms. Nawaz said with a chuckle. (It is not the kind of question that arises in Muslim countries, where being openly gay is virtually out of the question; such behavior is punishable by a death sentence in some places.)Fellow Muslims often dismiss her thoughts and questions as too outrageous, she admitted. “But now I have a whole series to express them.”Amaar, for example, is abandoning a law career to become the new imam, or prayer leader, in the small town of Mercy. His predecessor as imam preaches sermons like, “First there was ‘American Idol,’ and now there is ‘Canadian Idol.’ All idols must be smashed.”Ms. Nawaz wanted the show to look at how a native-born imam, exceedingly rare at the moment, might deal with issues differently from the standard imported imams. The actor who plays the young imam, Zaib Shaikh, is the only Muslim in the cast, although the creators said they had hoped more would audition.Another episode focuses on the anguished debate among strict Muslim families about allowing their children to dress up and collect candy on Halloween, a Christian affair built atop a pagan festival. Most North American Muslims eventually compromise because the day has been drained of religion. “Little Mosque on the Prairie” turns it into “Halal-oween,” halal being the Arabic word for anything religiously permissible.The sitcom grew out of the battle in Ms. Nawaz’s mosque in Regina over whether women had to pray behind a partition, a heated controversy across the United States and Canada. She vehemently opposed the idea, ultimately making a documentary released this year called “Me and the Mosque” about the tug-of-war with her own imam as well as similar segregation battles in Chicago and West Virginia.The documentary sparked her idea that all manner of tension between moderate and conservative Muslims — one episode focuses on the partition issue — would make both Muslims and non-Muslims laugh. There were 600,000 Muslims in Canada in the 2001 census, with the number now estimated around 800,000. Estimates for the American population are around six million.In an earnest manner not atypical of Canadians, one goal of the show is to explain Muslim behavior, or at least make Muslims seem less peculiar, much as humor about Jews, Italians or gays helped those groups assimilate.“On the news all you ever hear are voices from the extreme end of the spectrum,” Ms. Darling said. “This gives voice to ordinary people who look just like other ordinary people.”With its small-town setting and affable cast of characters — even a talk radio host who labels Muslims as terrorists comes across as rather lighthearted — the show unrolls a bit like “Mary Tyler Moore” or some other 1970s sitcom. It is scheduled to start on CBC on Jan. 9, with eight episodes. More are under negotiation. Pitches will be made to networks in the United States in December, so at first only Americans in border states will be likeley to have access to it.Test audiences have been somewhat divided, the producers said. Younger viewers, especially Muslims, tend to laugh openly with recognition. Others, particularly the older generation — whether Muslim or not — hesitate.“Nobody has done a comedy about Muslims before, so they are not sure how to take it,” Ms. Nawaz said. “Some non-Muslims wonder, ‘Are we allowed to laugh?’ ”'"

"'06-12-07,'0','But even professionals often pack a little cam just in case — or, rather, in pocket. Here’s what’s new in the budget cams of 2006.LOOKS A couple of weeks ago, I asked a camera manager for Circuit City in Manhattan what people want most in a camera these days.His answer: “Basically, style.” He told me that most shoppers are more interested in a camera’s looks than in its picture quality.Ah, well. There’s plenty of style on display in the $300 gang. Nikon’s sleek S7c is dressed in metallic gray with chrome accents. Its three-inch screen — the largest in the group — makes a huge difference in framing and displaying your photos.Samsung’s NV3 also turns heads. Its nearly featureless front is matte-black metal. With its sky-blue accents and rounded sides, it’s a thing of wonder, if not beauty.On both of these cameras, the zoom lens is entirely internal, rather than telescoping outward; a prism bends the light. The result is a slimmer, sleeker body (the camera’s, not yours).SPEED Shutter lag is still a problem on inexpensive cameras. Unless you prefocus by half-pressing the shutter button, you miss shots because of the half-second the camera takes to focus.Some companies have invested in faster circuitry on their little cameras, but you won’t find it in this price range. (Canon’s SD800 IS is especially fast, but it costs about $360.)LOW LIGHT Low-light shots remain the Achilles’ heels of inexpensive cams. Tiny cameras have tiny sensors, measuring about half an inch across or even less, and they just don’t soak up much light.Some cameras, like the Kodak, just say: “Hey, it’s dark in here,” and deliver a dark photo. Most of the others automatically bump up the light sensitivity (ISO setting), resulting in horrifying grain. Only the Fuji has been designed from the beginning to excel in low light without the flash.STABILIZER Let’s face it: blur happens. In low light, the shutter stays open longer to absorb enough light, and is therefore susceptible to tiny hand shakes. Zooming in or shooting while moving magnify motion blur.So the big news in 2006 cameras was image stabilization. Real optical image stabilizers work amazingly well; they jiggle the lens or the sensor to counter camera movement.In this roundup, all companies but Canon and Sony claim some kind of antiblur technology. But in fact, only the Pentax and the Panasonic offer a true mechanical stabilizer. All the others just bump up the ISO or apply antiblur software.Yes, blurry photos are still part of life with the low-priced cams.MEGAPIXELS All of these cameras offer six- to eight-megapixel resolution except the Pentax, which claims 10; anything over five is plenty for making even poster-size prints. No matter what the manufacturers imply, the megapixel count has zero effect on picture quality. More megapixels means more freedom to crop your photos before printing, but also means that your memory card and hard drive fill up a lot faster.BATTERY Little cameras mean little batteries. Most of these mini-cams manage fewer than 200 shots a charge (compare that with as many as 2,500 on a digital S.L.R.). The Pentax is particularly feeble (150 shots); the Canon and Fuji are particularly impressive (500).Of course, it’s easy to see why the Canon gets away with such great battery life: it’s a big, honking machine that holds four AA-size batteries, preferably rechargeable. The Kodak also takes AA-size. Those AA’s aren’t quite as convenient as the proprietary bricks found in the other cameras, of course. But in a pinch, you can duck into a drugstore to buy more.MOVIE MODE Digital cameras are getting better and better at shooting movies. All of this year’s models can take movies that fill your TV screen (640 by 480). All but the Olympus and H. P. can do so at TV smoothness (30 frames a second).A few cameras (Kodak, H. P., Samsung, Nikon) even offer true optical zoom while filming, although you may hear the lens zooming on the soundtrack. The Samsung even lets you pause and then resume, like a real camcorder, even within a single movie clip.OPTICAL VIEWFINDER Eyepiece viewfinders are disappearing; in this group, only the Canon and Sony still have them. The others require you to use the screen for framing your photos — but the screen may fade in bright sun, may turn black in dim light, and eats up battery power. Rally the bloggers! Save the optical viewfinder!NEXT-GEN FEATURES Except as noted here, the cameras in this class are all pretty much alike. They’re all silver, all about the same size, with a 3X zoom and pretty much the same set of features. Here and there, though, you can see a manufacturer going for something fresh.Nikon’s S7c, for example, has a Wi-Fi transmitter; in a wireless hot spot, you can send your photos directly to any e-mail address. The process is extremely straightforward. Dialing in the letters of an e-mail address using the tiny thumb ring dial is tedious, but at least the camera remembers the addresses once you input them. The camera includes a free year of photo-sending at T-Mobile hot spots.Samsung’s NV3 is even more radical. It aspires to be a video iPod, capable of playing music, showing photos and even movies. It’s a tad limited; it accepts only unprotected music files (nothing bought online), and you have to convert your videos into a special format using buggy software that’s provided for Windows only. You get about two hours of movie playback per charge.PICTURE QUALITY O.K., so maybe the public has spoken. Maybe it has said, “We care how the camera looks, not the pictures.”But if you’re among the few, the proud, who still care about the quality of the photos, here’s the story.The photo-quality winner is the big, homely Canon A630. Not only are its colors the truest and its details the sharpest, but it has more photographic features than any other model (optical viewfinder, autofocus lamp, manual controls, and a tie for biggest sensor). It has a 4X zoom (exceeded here only by the Olympus, with 5X), plus the only flip-out, rotating screen that lets you shoot over people’s heads or below waist level.Fuji’s FinePix F30 tied for first place last year, which tells you something: in digital camera years, it’s getting old. But this camera still leads the pack in low light — even candlelight shots look clear and beautiful — and its everyday shots rarely disappoint.The Kodak, Sony and Panasonic also perform well — and they’re more consistently satisfying than the rest of the pack, where digital grain, softness of details and cameraphonish colors sometimes creep in. The cheap-feeling H. P. and the splash-resistant Olympus are actually capable of taking grainy shots even in broad daylight.Now that you know what’s in store, you’re ready to confront another eternal question: How long before the camera I buy will be obsolete?'"
"'06-12-07,'0','FOR those who want an even more permanent solution than extensions, eyelash transplants are the latest crossover from reconstructive to cosmetic surgery.Dr. Marcelo Gandelman, a plastic surgeon in São Paulo, Brazil, began experimenting with the technique in 1967 during a residency in a burn unit. Over the years he has modified and simplified the technique, teaching at conferences of the International Society of Hair Restoration Surgery.His former pupil Dr. Jennifer Martinick of Australia has revised the technique. Like him, she takes hair from the back of the scalp to implant into the eyelid, but her technique allows the implantation of multiple hairs at once, on both upper and lower lids, with more control over the direction the hair grows.Dr. Alan Bauman of Boca Raton, Fla., who performs the procedure, said he charges $3,000 a lid, which includes two nights in a hotel. Once safely transplanted, the hair grows. And grows. And grows. Dr. Bauman said interest in the procedure from patients and physicians “has exploded in the past four to six months,” but he has found himself suggesting to makeup artists that beauty schools offer training in the maintenance of implanted lashes.“I don’t want these patients going home and playing around with scissors near their eyeball,” he said.The intensive upkeep is one reason Dr. Gandelman and Dr. Martinick limit the procedure mostly to trauma patients and those with trichotillomania (the compulsion to pull out one’s hair on the face or head). “You’ve got to be really motivated, “ Dr. Martinick said. “What happens if a 25-year-old has the procedure, then when she’s 45 with three children and her priorities change, she doesn’t want them anymore?”Dr. Gandelman said he worries that body dysmorphics would be particularly attracted to lash implants. “They use mascara, then extensions,” he said. Then, “they come in with a beauty magazine saying this is real beauty.”'"

"'06-12-08,'1','A summary of the top stories in Russian newspapers on Friday.MORE POISONINGS, INVESTIGATIONS AND THEORIES: The Russian Prosecutor General’s Office opened a criminal case on Thursday into the poisoning death of Alexander V. Litvinenko after three days of investigations alongside detectives from Britain’s Scotland Yard. By initiating a criminal case, Izvestia reports, Russia can demand the extradition of suspects from other countries. The Prosecutor General’s Office also said that it may send its own team of investigators to London, Gazeta reported.In a new twist, the prosecutor general’s news service announced that the office had opened a case to investigate what it called the attempted murder of Dmitri V. Kovtun, a key witness in the Litvinenko case, who met with the former intelligence officer on the supposed day he was poisoned, Nezavisimaya Gazeta reported.According the Prosecutor General’s Office, Nezavisimaya Gazeta said, Mr. Kovtun was poisoned with polonium 210, the same radioactive isotope suspected in Mr. Litvinenko’s death. Gazeta reported, citing Interfax, that Mr. Kovtun was in the hospital on Thursday in critical condition, suffering from the same symptoms as Mr. Litvinenko before he died. The lawyer for Andrei K. Lugovoi, another witness in the case, contested this report, Gazeta wrote. Andrei Romashov told the newspaper that Mr. Kovtun was in “satisfactory condition.”On Wednesday, Russian and British investigators interviewed Mr. Kovtun in the hospital, where he and Mr. Lugovoi were undergoing tests for radiation poisoning, Gazeta wrote. Both men have said they met with Mr. Litvinenko on Nov. 1 at the Millennium Mayflower Hotel in London. On Thursday, Gazeta wrote, investigators in London detected traces of polonium 210 in several employees at the hotel bar. Given this information, the newspaper said, the poisoning must have occurred at this location.Meanwhile, Izvestia once again had its own theories. The newspaper continued to insist that all evidence points to Boris A. Berezovsky, the exiled Russian businessman. In one of the newspaper’s versions, Mr. Litvinenko poisoned himself while acting as a courier of illegal radioactive substances for Mr. Berezovsky. The newspaper said that the polonium that poisoned Mr. Litvinenko could have originated from an atomic research center in the breakaway republic of Abkhazia. The leader of Georgia’s Green Party proposed this theory earlier in the week. The newspaper also raised questions about the involvement of Leonid Nevzlin, a former Yukos employee living in exile in Israel, who also met with Mr. Litvinenko shortly before he died.'"

"'06-12-08,'1','“The labor market is pretty tight right now, so it’s not a huge surprise that we’ve started to see big wage gains,” said Nariman Behravesh, chief economist for the research firm Global Insight. “I think the big surprise is that it took so long.”Still, there are a number of economic forces at work that raise doubts about whether the recent gains are the start of another boom. It is also possible, economists say, the improvement may turn out to be little more than a temporary spike.For now, though, with the number of unemployed Americans actively seeking work at a five-year low, help-wanted signs are proliferating again and many businesses are having a harder time finding employees.That means even lower-wage workers like Mercedes Herrera, an immigrant from Mexico who cleans at San Felipe Plaza, a high-rise office building in Houston, are enjoying more leverage with their employers. Last month, Ms. Herrera’s union, the Service Employees International Union, settled a monthlong strike and secured raises of more than $2 an hour over the next two years for some 5,300 janitors in Houston.The pay of Ms. Herrera, a 37-year-old mother of four, will increase to $6.25 an hour on Jan. 1, from $5.65 now. “It’s going to be a big difference in my personal finances,” she said, speaking through a translator. With the extra money, she said, she hoped she would no longer have to ask for food from churches.“We’ve always had to save for things that we have to buy,” she said. “We’ve had to create our own miracles in order to sustain ourselves.”After years of stagnant, even declining real wages for the typical worker, the recent jump has also delivered a rare bit of good news for a White House coping with an unpopular war and the aftermath of the Democratic victory in the midterm elections.The pay increases are “huge, even relative to a period that we think of as quite good,” said Edward P. Lazear, chairman of President Bush’s Council of Economic Advisers. “The question obviously will be, How long will it be sustained?”That question will begin to be answered today when the Labor Department releases its monthly employment report. Forecasters expect the pay gains — which began in earnest in September, when gas prices sank — to extend into November.But the economy has slowed significantly in recent months, and some analysts predict the housing slump will cause a further slowdown next year that will be a drag on incomes.“The biggest issue is which direction the macroeconomy is headed,” said Jason Furman, an economist at New York University who served as an adviser to President Bill Clinton. “And there is probably a bit more uncertainty than usual about that.”If wages rise for only a few months, the current expansion, on the verge of entering its sixth year of growth, would still stand out as an unusually bad one for workers — indeed, the only one since World War II without a sustained pay increase.In the third quarter, which included the early weeks of the recent pay increases, the share of the nation’s economic output going to workers’ pay and benefits fell to its lowest level in 40 years, according to the Commerce Department.Further, the average hourly wage for a worker in a nonmanagerial position, $16.91 an hour in October, was about the same as it was in 2003 when inflation is taken into account.Some economists and incoming Congressional Democrats argue that economic trends like globalization and computerization have fundamentally altered the job market over the last decade or so. In this view, the solid pay increases of the late 1990s, stretching over multiple years, were caused by the technology bubble more than anything else and are unlikely to be repeated anytime soon.“It’s a good job market, but it’s not the great job market it was back in the late ’90s,” said Mark Zandi, an economist with Moody’s Economy.com. “It was the tightest job market that, arguably, we’ve ever seen.”At the height of the 1990s boom, the job market became so hot that Burger King was offering $5,000 bonuses to lure managers away from rival restaurants. The unemployment rate hit a low of 3.8 percent in the spring of 2000. Optimism among workers soared, according to polls.In the exit polls conducted on Election Day last month, on the other hand, only 30 percent of voters said they expected life to improve for the next generation of Americans.For now, however, paychecks are growing fatter in nearly every corner of the economy. Average hourly earnings for workers outside management grew faster than inflation in every major sector but manufacturing from October 2005 to October 2006, according to Moody’s Economy.com. For workers in leisure and hospitality, financial services and natural resources, for example, wages grew more than 4 percent, after accounting for inflation.After years of sharply rising income inequality, the recent rise in wages also appears to be increasing pay for both rich and poor. From July through September, the inflation-adjusted hourly pay of workers near the bottom of the wage scale — those making less than 90 percent of all workers but more than the worst-off 10 percent — rose 0.1 percent.That compares with 0.4 percent wage growth for those close to the top, those making more than 9 out of 10 other workers, according to an analysis of Labor Department statistics by the Economic Policy Institute. Wage growth for both groups is likely to pick up in the final quarter of the year.Last year, inflation-adjusted wages of workers at the 10th percentile fell 1.8 percent, compared with a gain of 0.3 percent at the 90th percentile.The most obvious cause of the recent turnaround is the fall in energy prices. Nominal wages have been accelerating since the beginning of 2004, but inflation, led by soaring gas prices, kept Americans from noticing any real rise in their pay during much of that time. Since the price of a gallon of regular gasoline peaked for the year at $3.03 in early August, prices at the pump have steadily declined. The national average is now down to about $2.29 a gallon.That has taken a tremendous weight off wages, which finally started to outpace inflation in August. Inflation ran at a rate of 1.3 percent from October 2005 to October of this year, the lowest level since mid-2002. Earlier this year, inflation was running as high as 4.3 percent.Wages have risen so swiftly that some economists worry that they could push inflation up on their own, by forcing companies to raise prices. Last week, the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, warned that the central bank might have to raise interest rates again. “One factor that we are watching carefully is labor costs,” he said.The implications for higher inflation aside, Mr. Lazear, the White House economist, said he believed — and hoped — the trend would continue. “It’s not unreasonable to think that real wage growth will be sustained for a significant period of time simply because the labor market is so tight,” he said.Workers — many having cut their savings and taken on more debt as wages failed to keep pace with inflation — would welcome that.Alanzo Brown, who handles hazardous materials for a chemical company in Houston and recently completed a course that qualifies him for a raise, is expecting his pay to rise $4 an hour soon, to $19. At 29, Mr. Brown hopes to start saving more money so he can move from a rented apartment into his own home.“I’m really trying to get into this saving thing,” Mr. Brown said.'"
"'06-12-08,'1','BAGHDAD, Dec. 7 — A bill that would extend the life of the federal agency that oversees billions of dollars of reconstruction money in Iraq appeared headed to passage after a key House Republican dropped his opposition on Thursday and declared that he would vote for the bill.The agency was praised Wednesday by the bipartisan Iraq Study Group, which recommended that the oversight agency “should be renewed for the duration of assistance programs in Iraq.”Some degree of American financial assistance is likely to flow to Iraq for as long as American troops are stationed there. But that kind of extension for the agency, the Office of the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction, had been opposed by Duncan Hunter, the California Republican who recently declared himself a likely candidate for president in 2008.In October, members of Mr. Hunter’s staff inserted an obscure provision into a huge defense authorization bill that would force the inspector general’s office to begin shutting down almost immediately. Because the office, led by a Republican lawyer, Stuart W. Bowen Jr., has repeatedly uncovered instances of wasted money, shoddy construction and criminal fraud in the rebuilding program, the move caused an outcry among Democrats and Republicans on Capitol Hill.A bill to reverse the termination, introduced by Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, with several Democratic and Republican co-sponsors was passed in the Senate on Wednesday. But an identical bill introduced in the House by Representative Ike Skelton, Democrat of Missouri, appeared to have little chance when the majority leadership made no move to bring it to a floor for a vote.'"
"'06-12-08,'1','Likewise, some lawmakers — especially those who spent much of the summer working in a special legislative session on property taxes — said that they were disappointed by the governor’s request.Assemblyman Kevin J. O’Toole, a Republican who served on the committee that studied the cost of benefits, said that the governor’s request represented “a wasted opportunity.”“We’ve accomplished nothing, absolutely nothing,” Mr. O’Toole said at a meeting of the benefits committee on Thursday. “We’ve finished where we started.”“This makes New Jersey look ridiculous,” Mr. O’Toole said, adding that, “Even by Trenton standards, this is a bizarre and unusual day.”But Senator Nicholas P. Scutari, a Democrat who helped lead the benefits committee, said the problem was that the drafters of the legislation had not properly taken into account the panel’s work. “I can’t describe the motivation,” Mr. Scutari said.Of Mr. Corzine’s action, Mr. Scutari would say only: “I believe the governor has the best interest of the state of New Jersey in mind.”The benefits committee was one of four bipartisan joint panels assigned to develop strategies to lower the highest property tax rates. New Jersey’s average tax bill is $6,000 a year.Last month, the benefits panel proposed 41 ways to save the state money by taking steps like increasing the retirement age to 62 from 55 and requiring state employees to contribute more to health plans.Earlier this week, legislators introduced 17 bills based on the work of the session, including proposals to create a state comptroller and test the idea of consolidating the state’s 615 school districts into 21 county-based systems.Three other proposals — to reduce property taxes paid by the state’s homeowners by 20 percent, to limit annual property tax increases and to change the way New Jersey pays for public education — are expected to be included in bills to be introduced in the next several days.Lawmakers said that they wanted to pass all the legislation inspired by the property tax session by Jan. 1.When the benefits legislation was unveiled on Tuesday, union leaders called many of its provisions arbitrary and unfair. On Thursday, they praised Mr. Corzine for making his appeal to the Legislature.“We’re obviously pleased that the governor has recognized that these issues are best addressed in collective bargaining,” said Bob Master, a spokesman for the Communications Workers of America, which represents many white-collar state employees. “Had they gone ahead with this legislation, it would have been a disaster. They were trying to make sweeping changes without any input.”Assemblywoman Nellie Pou, a Democrat who represents Passaic and Bergen Counties, said that the forum for lowering the costs of benefits — either the Legislature or the bargaining table — did not matter as much as whether the state meets its goal: saving money. “This certainly does not change our mission,” Ms. Pou said.Still, others said that the delay was particularly discouraging considering the effort that lawmakers put into the special session, which included 41 hearings over 100 days.“I’ve spent the last four months and now we’ve done nothing,” said Senator William L. Gormley, a Republican from Atlantic County. “Why did we have a committee?”'"
"'06-12-08,'1','On one level, Mr. Yildiz is right: St. Korbinian church and the city’s mayor have welcomed the mosque, which would be the third, and most prominent, in Munich, the heartland of German Catholicism.But a vocal minority of residents has resisted, holding protest meetings, collecting signatures, and filing a petition with the Bavarian Parliament. “Bavarian life,” the petition declares, “is marked by the drinking of beer and the eating of pork. In Muslim faith, both are unclean and forbidden.” With the support of Bavaria’s conservative state government, the residents have been able to tie up the project in court.Mosques have existed in Germany for decades, but only in recent years has there been a building boom. There are now 150 mosques in Germany, in addition to about 2,000 Muslim prayer rooms in cellars, warehouses and other converted industrial spaces.As Germany’s 3.2 million Muslims put down deeper roots, they are no longer willing to worship furtively. A few of their projects — like a new mosque in the industrial city of Duisberg — have some of the grandeur of great European cathedrals. More than 1,000 people can pray under its soaring domes, which are meant to evoke the Blue Mosque in Istanbul.“Whenever Muslims in Germany come out of their closets or hidden places, the controversy starts,” said Claus Leggewie, a political scientist at Giessen University who has written about mosques in Germany.“The protests begin on technical issues, like parking problems and noise,” he said. “But it has a cultural bias. There is a nationalist minority, which opposes immigration and especially Muslim immigration.”Right-wing politicians pander to these sentiments, Mr. Leggewie said, aided by the specter of Islamic terrorism and by a number of extremist mosques in Germany that have rattled even some open-minded Germans. Muslim groups aggravate the tensions, he said, by not talking to their non-Muslim neighbors.The Munich dispute has an added edge because Bavaria is the most religious and conservative state in Germany. Pope Benedict XVI was born near here, and once served as archbishop of Munich. He delivered his now famous speech, in which he seemed to equate Islam with violence, at the nearby University of Regensburg.“I understood his message,” Mrs. Schandl said, drinking a beer at the market where she used to work.The mayor of Munich, Christian Ude, noted that Protestants had a tough time here, too, until two centuries ago. And then there was the burning of the Jewish synagogue by the Nazis in 1938. “The theme of houses of worship for religious minorities has a long history in Munich,” he said.Munich has between 80,000 and 120,000 Muslims, the bulk of them from Turkey, who constitute nearly 10 percent of its population. The city’s first mosque was built in the 1960s on the outskirts of town, and caused little comment. A second was built in the 1990s, also outside the center, and drew some opposition from the Christian Social Union, the conservative party that has ruled Bavaria for decades.The proposed mosque is to take the place of an Islamic prayer center that is now housed in an old furniture warehouse nearby. As the Turks see it, having a proper mosque is a sign of their maturity as an immigrant group in German society.“Turks are now in their third generation in Germany,” said Metin Avci, the imam of the community in Sendling. “In the first generation, they only wanted to work to earn money. In the second and third generations, they developed a desire to worship in a more visible way.”After a competition, the group chose a local architect, Walter Höfler, who came up with a contemporary design, which he says does not compete with that of the church.The mosque’s minarets, he noted, would rise 134 feet — 46 feet short of the steeples of the church. Each would have a sign, spelling the word Allah, which could be lighted at night. They would also have balconies — decorative rather than functional, because under German law, a muezzin cannot broadcast a call to prayer from them.The mosque would have the capacity to hold 250 men and 150 women. But Mr. Yildiz said it was also designed to accommodate non-Muslims for social and educational activities.“We want to integrate into Germany,” said Mr. Yildiz, who is 40 and has lived here for 25 years. “We want to have a presentable place, where we can invite guests to drink tea.”St. Korbinian and the local Protestant church both seem open to such a dialogue. They have steadfastly supported the mosque. But they say the debate has divided their members.Wolfgang Neuner, a parish counselor at St. Korbinian, said parishioners told him they would not feel comfortable at prayer, knowing that they were near a mosque. Andrea Borger, the deacon at the Protestant church, got a letter asking, “What are you going to say when your daughter isn’t able to walk in this neighborhood without a head scarf?”Such fears resonate with politicians. Speaking in a beer tent last April, Bavaria’s prime minister, Edmund Stoiber, pledged to block the mosque. His Christian Social Union invalidated the preliminary permit that was issued by the Munich government, which is run by a coalition of the Social Democratic Party and the Greens.Mr. Ude, the mayor, who studied in Turkey as a young man and grew a mustache there that he still wears, said the conservatives were exploiting the issue before elections in 2008. He said he was confident that the courts would reinstate the building permit.Fears about mosques are not entirely misplaced, he acknowledged. Munich’s oldest mosque is under police surveillance because of its radical tendencies. But Mr. Ude said the planned mosque — which is linked to Ditim, a moderate Turkish group — would pose no danger.For Turkish residents of Munich, even those who are not religious, the mosque has become a fraught symbol. “This has been a very emotional debate for me,” said Sedef Ozakin, a female member of the city council. “I think, ‘Why should I integrate into this country when it doesn’t even recognize my religious beliefs?’ ”'"
"'06-12-08,'1','The Seminole Tribe of Florida said yesterday that it had acquired Hard Rock International, the music-themed chain of restaurants, hotels and casinos, from the Rank Group of Britain for $965 million, one of the largest purchases ever by an American Indian tribe.The sale signals the exit of Rank from the restaurant industry, as it seeks to focus on its casino operations amid disappointing earnings. It is also the Seminoles’ largest acquisition yet in gambling, a business the tribe first entered in 1979 with a series of bingo halls. The tribe, which currently draws about 90 percent of its income from gambling, has sought in recent years to diversify its revenue streams.“You’re here for a special day in Seminole history,” said Max B. Osceola Jr., a Seminole council representative. “Our ancestors sold Manhattan for trinkets. We’re going to buy Manhattan back, one burger at a time.”Rank put Hard Rock up for sale this summer. In trading in London yesterday, shares of Rank fell more than 4 percent, to 255.5 pence amid concerns that it had sold the franchise for too low a price.Founded in 1971 in London, Hard Rock employs about 7,000 at 124 restaurants in 45 countries, as well as at seven hotels, two casinos and two concert venues. The company also owns what it says is the world’s largest collection of rock memorabilia, including items from Elvis, Bob Dylan and Madonna.'"
"'06-12-08,'1','GAITHERSBURG, Md., Dec. 7 — Growing evidence that deadly clots can form in drug-coated stents long after they are implanted does not mean that the risks of using the tiny devices to prop open the arteries in the heart outweigh the benefits, according to a panel of experts assembled Thursday to scrutinize the troubling data.But the group quickly agreed that the conclusion applied only to patients who had been involved in clinical trials of the two drug-coated stents now on the domestic market, Taxus, from Boston Scientific, and Cypher, from Johnson & Johnson. Such patients are generally healthier and more likely to have followed instructions about taking anticlotting drugs every day than the majority of patients currently receiving the stents. They make up well under half of the nearly one million Americans receiving stents annually.The panel, brought together by federal regulators, will spend much of Friday considering the less reliable “real world” data on clotting risks in the far more diverse array of patients who receive the drug-coated stents in everyday practice, including groups like diabetics and patients with major blockages in multiple blood vessels.After presentations Thursday from the two companies and a handful of other researchers, panel members disagreed about how strong the evidence was that the delayed clotting risk was a serious problem compared with the risks of using older, less expensive bare metal stents. Overall death and heart attack rates for the clinical trial patients were so low and so similar for the two groups after four years that the experts said much bigger and longer trials would be needed to answer the questions from the Food and Drug Administration.“We’re all over the place, but I don’t think any of us think this is conclusive data,” said the chairman of the panel, Dr. William H. Maisel of Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston.'"
"'06-12-08,'1','“He is the leading contender to succeed Neville some day, but by no means is it a certainty,” said John Sicher, the publisher and editor of Beverage Digest, an industry newsletter. “He still needs to prove himself in this new job.”Mr. Kent, who is 54 years old and has had a long history with Coke, working frequently with Mr. Isdell, returned to Coke in May 2005 as president of the North Asia, Eurasia and Middle East Group.He joined Coke in 1978 but left in 1999 to become chief executive of the Efes Beverage Group, which is the majority shareholder of Coke’s Turkish bottler, Coca-Cola Icecek.Another analyst, Mark Swartzberg of Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, said yesterday in a report to investors: “We consider Mr. Kent a logical choice given his current role and Coke system experience.“We are less clear he is a good choice given his relatively short tenure as head of international (since January 2006).”In addition to his experience heading the company’s international businesses, Mr. Kent also has strong ties to the company’s bottlers, Mr. Isdell said in his statement. “Muhtar’s close working relationship with our bottling partners has enabled us to capture marketplace opportunities and improve the way we do business,” he said.Mr. Kent’s career is not without controversy. In 1997, he reached a settlement with the Australian Securities Commission over selling short shares in the Coke bottler where he was an executive, betting the stock would go down, before the bottler issued a profit warning. The short sale was a result of a decision by his financial adviser, according to a Coca-Cola spokesman. Mr. Kent was asked to repay profits from the sale and reimburse the commission for the cost of the investigation.“This matter was thoroughly investigated and conclusively resolved by the A.S.C. a decade ago,” Mr. Isdell said in a statement. “The board and I, guided by outside counsel, carefully reviewed the matter and we are satisfied that it was the result of an honest mistake.”While analysts said Mr. Kent appeared to be well positioned to succeed Mr. Isdell, the Coke presidency has not been a sure route to the chief executive’s job. The last person in the job, Steven J. Heyer, left after Mr. Isdell was brought back from retirement to become chief executive. Mr. Isdell has not announced any plans to leave and Coke does not have a mandatory retirement age.In an interview last January, when Mr. Kent was named head of international operations, Mr. Isdell also seemed to play down any talk of Mr. Kent’s being a front-runner to eventually take his place. “This is a long-term turnaround,” he said. “Muhtar’s got a big challenge, and he’s got to prove successful in this job before he’s a candidate.”'"
"'06-12-08,'1','The increase in cultural references to hedge funds, of course, parallels the explosive growth in hedge funds. There are now nearly 9,000 of them, with total assets of more than $1.2 trillion, up from $38.9 billion in 1990, according to Hedge Fund Research.“I guess you could say it’s one more example of professional, insider devices being democratically diffused and embraced by the quasi-masses,” Kurt Andersen, the journalist and cultural critic said via e-mail. “We saw it with kitchen equipment (restaurant stoves, etc.) starting in the ’80s, video cameras and online trading in the ’90s, audio/music software in the ’00s, and so on.”As lightly regulated, sometimes wildly profitable pools of investments, hedge funds have been distinguished in the popular mind by two qualities: secretive and lucrative. “Honey, shady is kind of the definition of hedge funds,” a character on the NBC crime drama “Crossing Jordan” declared this year.But as is often the case with depictions of science, medicine, law and finance, the portrayal of hedge funds is not always accurate.“They’ve become a catchall for a secretive capital structure,” said Ann C. Logue, the author of “Hedge Funds for Dummies.” “Often now it means a shadow financial system that’s being set up.”In “Casino Royale,” the latest James Bond adventure, the villain Le Chiffre is described as a private banker to terrorists and insurgents. He seeks to make millions by short selling — the hedge fund tactic that has provoked lawsuits by some corporate executives. (To be sure, no hedge fund manager has been accused of trying to drag down a jet maker’s share price by blowing up its latest aircraft, which is essentially the Bond villain’s investment strategy.)In the summer, the short-lived ABC reality show “One Ocean View,” which aimed to show the love lives of 11 20-somethings at their Fire Island, N.Y., weekend house, featured Lauren, a junior analyst at an unnamed hedge fund. That she proved to be among the most aggressive of the cast members was perhaps not surprising. This fall, the high-definition cable TV network INHD ran “Wall Street Warriors,” a six-episode series documenting the lives of financial professionals. Among those featured was Timothy K. Sykes, a voluble 25-year-old hedge fund manager who made more than a million dollars off his bar mitzvah money.Then there have been stories of young hedge fund stars spending huge sums of money on fast cars and fancy art, as well as magazine photo spreads of top managers’ estates in Greenwich, Conn., and the Hamptons on Long Island.Some might point to the public’s growing fascination with hedge funds as a possible sign that the business has hit a peak. But for now, hedge funds are basking in the klieg lights.Consider “Hedge Funds for Dummies,” which Ms. Logue said was written from February to June of this year. Most of the 342-page book resembles a how-to manual for the asset class, featuring chapter titles like “Fitting Hedge Funds Into a Portfolio” and “How to Buy Into a Hedge Fund.” But Ms. Logue, a finance professor at the University of Illinois at Chicago, said that she did not intend the book as a set of instructions and pointed out that one chapter is titled “Using Hedge-Fund Strategies Without Hedge Funds.” Mostly, she saw the book as a reference guide for the curious; she expects only a few high-net-worth individuals to use the book seriously as an instruction manual.Still, she said, the attraction to hedge funds would inevitably draw otherwise uninformed people to the book, thinking they, too, can invest in the funds.“Everyone’s fascinated by money,” she said. “And when they hear about this new way of making money, and that it’s very secretive, it holds an undeniable appeal.”'"

"'06-12-08,'1','IF you needed to find out how much pollution an industrial plant in your neighborhood was spewing, or what toxic chemicals were in a local river, where would you go? Until recently, you could discover the answer at one of the Environmental Protection Agency’s 29 libraries. But now the E.P.A. has obstructed the American public — as well as its own scientists and staff — by starting to dismantle its crown jewel, the national system of regional E.P.A. libraries.Until now, any citizen could consult these resources, which include information on things like siting incinerators, storing toxic waste and uncovering links between asthma and car exhaust. E.P.A. staff members and other scientists have counted on the libraries to support their work. First responders and other state and local government officials have used E.P.A. information to protect communities. In the age of terrorism, when the safety of our food and water supply, the uninterrupted flow of energy and, indeed, so much about our environment has become a matter of national security, it seems particularly dangerous to take steps that would hinder our emergency preparedness.Although lawmakers haven’t yet agreed to President Bush’s proposed 2007 budget, which includes $2 million in cuts to the agency’s library system, the head of the E.P.A. has already instituted cuts. The agency’s main library in Washington has been closed to the public, and regional E.P.A. libraries in Chicago, Dallas and Kansas City, Mo., have been closed altogether. At the Boston, New York, San Francisco and Seattle branches, hours and public access have been reduced.Anyone who needs to understand the environmental impact of, say, living downwind or downstream from a new nuclear power plant, or the long-term public health impact of Hurricane Katrina, cannot afford to find the doors barred to potentially lifesaving information. But neither can the rest of us, whose daily lives and choices will be affected by global warming. We all have a right to be able to get access to information about our air, water and soil.“Libraries and their professionals are integral to the work of E.P.A. toxicologists,” says an agency toxicologist, Suzanne Wuerthele. “Without access to their expertise and extensive collections, it will be difficult to explain to the public, to state agencies, industry and to the courts how and why E.P.A. is protecting the environment over time.”Some members of Congress have begun to bring these cuts to light. The Senate minority whip, Richard Durbin, urged the president to reopen the libraries and rethink his budget request. Eighteen senators sent a letter to the Senate Appropriations Committee asking it to make the E.P.A. keep the libraries open. Representatives John Dingell, Bart Gordon and Henry Waxman recently had the Government Accountability Office start an inquiry into the closings and requested that the E.P.A. administrator, Stephen Johnson, cease the destruction of library materials immediately.The E.P.A. cannot hide behind the fig leaf of fiscal responsibility. While the agency says the closings are all part of a commitment to modernize and digitize, we are not assured that its public plan is adequate or its skills sufficient. Users within the E.P.A. and the American public need information specialists, like librarians, to manage paper collections and to help them get access to digital material and organize online information.'"
"'06-12-08,'1','Sedate images of dreamy, slightly odd looking older women reading books in bed can be found on nearly every wall, as can images of sexual encounters. Some, named for different cities, seem lifted from pornographic magazines and have slightly coarsened surfaces, along with odd touches, like the spindly female legs akimbo in “The Danes.” Others, overtly silken and involving two figures who are, or seem to be, women, alternate between the lush accouterments of Rubens, up to and including a fur cape (“The Dane”), and a throw-back-the-sheets heat suggesting a fusion of Watteau, Boucher and Fragonard. This contrast prevails in two nearly identical versions of the same embrace. “Kissers,” which shows the lovers from the chest up, is acceptable museum fare. “Malmo” extends the image a bit lower to include what centuries of painters have not.Mr. Currin seems at his best — and in some ways his wisest — on familiar ground, as in “Patch and Pearl.” It shows two young women, deflowered Breck girls, whose pregnant bellies aren’t quite where they should be; they stand on a roof trimmed with a bit of Classical egg-and-dart molding — insemination is in the details — where you might expect a gutter.While Mr. Currin flits about the imagined spaces of history at Gagosian, Mr. Freud, who turns 84 today, seems relatively hunkered down and housebound. In a sense the reality of figurative painting itself has always been Mr. Freud’s primary subject. Sexuality, while not absent, is certainly not on display, much less acted out. His best paintings make palpable the claustrophobia of the studio and its harsh light, the dead weight of the people posing and their inscrutable thoughts or blank minds, and the continuous effort on the painter’s part to get things right.The main influence has always seemed to be Cézanne. Although painted in a heavier hand, the faceted surfaces of Mr. Freud’s bodies have a similar built-up point by point articulation. As in Cézanne, the planes of the floor or the wall heave forward unexpectedly; the coverlet on a bed can form into landscapes. The struggle for resolution can be especially agitated around the faces of Mr. Freud’s female nudes, which are sometimes so overworked they seem almost battered. This may be why his portraits of men are often his strongest works.There seems to be a Freud exhibition formula. Most of his works home in on figures or faces in the studio, but occasionally he ventures out, making in this case a painting of his garden or the flank of a pony in a nearby stable. And there is usually a rather startling self-portrait. This time “The Painter Surprised by a Naked Admirer” shows the artist with a naked female model clinging to his leg as he stands (clothed), poised to work on the very painting we are looking at. Behind him is a wall that at first seems covered with heavy, dour vines but is actually stuccoed with years of paint that he has sloughed off his brush. The scene is more than a bit contrived, a marriage of self-mockery and narcissism.There is a lot of naked skin in both of these shows, but the skin of the paintings themselves is the most telling. Mr. Currin paints with a kind of innocent lightness and ease that is open and vulnerable, even joyful, but also a little too easily pleased. His strange juxtapositions, hints of unclear gender and disconcerting physical details, give his paintings an undertow that still feels unformed in its ambiguity, as if it is waiting to be brought out.Mr. Freud’s surface is tough, overt yet closed, almost like a turtle’s shell, but also insistent and dissatisfied.

"'06-12-09,'0','But a deal on the oil law could be reached within days, according to officials involved in the drafting. It would then go to the cabinet and Parliament for approval.The major remaining stumbling block, officials said, concerns the issuing of contracts for developing future oil fields. The Kurds are insisting that the regions reserve final approval over such contracts, fearing that if that power were given to a Shiite-dominated central government, it could ignore proposed contracts in the Kurdish north while permitting them in the Shiite south, American and Iraqi officials said.The national oil law lies at the heart of debates about the future of Iraq, particularly the issue of a strong central government versus robust regional governments. The oil question has also inflamed ethnic and sectarian tensions. Sunni Arabs, who preside over areas of the country that apparently have little or no oil, are adamant about the equitable distribution of oil revenues by the central government.On the drafting committee, Sunni Arabs have allied with the Shiites against the Kurds, who have sought to maintain as much regional control as possible over the oil industry in their autonomous northern enclave. Iraqi Kurdistan has enjoyed de facto independence since 1991, when the American military established a no-flight zone above the mountainous region to prevent raids by Saddam Hussein.Gen. George W. Casey Jr., the senior American commander here, and Zalmay Khalilzad, the American ambassador, have urged Iraqi politicians to put the oil law at the top of their agendas, saying it must be passed before the year’s end.The drafting committee is made up of ministers and politicians from the main Shiite, Sunni Arab and Kurdish blocs in government. They began talks months ago, but the pace picked up recently, said an American official tracking the negotiations, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he did not want to give the appearance of Western interference in sovereign Iraqi matters.At the start of the talks, the Kurds fought to ensure that regional governments have the power to collect and distribute revenues from future fields, Iraqi and American officials said. They also proposed that revenues be shared among the regions based on both population and crimes committed against the people under Mr. Hussein’s rule. That would have given the Kurds and Shiites a share of the oil wealth larger than the proportions of their populations.But the Kurds dropped those demands, said Barham Salih, a deputy prime minister who is a Kurd and the chairman of the committee.“Revenue sharing is an accepted principle by all the constituent elements of the Iraqi government, including the Kurds, and that is the unifying element that we’re all hoping for in the oil law,” Mr. Salih said in an interview.The American official said the Kurds were willing to make concessions because a national oil law could attract more foreign oil companies to exploration and development in Kurdistan. A large foreign oil company would have more confidence in signing a contract with the Kurds if it were to operate under the law of a sovereign country rather than just the law of an autonomous region.Some Kurdish leaders also believe that the concessions are a worthwhile price to pay for having a stake in the much larger revenue pool of the country’s oil industry, the American official said. The southern fields accounted for 85 percent of total Iraqi crude production last year, partly because northern production was hampered by insurgent sabotage. The south has an estimated 65 percent of the country’s 115 billion barrels of proven reserves.But the Kurds are still holding out on the issue of oil contracts, arguing that the Constitution guarantees the regions absolute rights in those matters. The Kurds recently discovered two new oil fields after signing exploration contracts with a Turkish company and a Norwegian company.“There are those among us who say we cannot go back to the former days of centralization, which were not conducive to good business practice and to the idea of federalism that is enshrined in the Constitution,” Mr. Salih said.In its recommendations released Wednesday, the Iraq Study Group took the opposite tack, to the anger of the Kurds. The report said that “no formula that gives control over revenues from future fields to the regions or gives control of oil fields to the regions is compatible with national reconciliation.” Though the Kurds have ceded their position on the issue of future revenues, they are fighting for control over the development of future fields.The drafting committee met Thursday night to try to resolve the contract issue, but could not reach an agreement.Distributing revenues by population could be a difficult matter without a reliable census, which Iraq lacks. Sunni Arabs often claim they are at least 60 percent of the population, not the 20 percent that is commonly cited. The Shiites are generally estimated to be 60 percent of the population, and the Kurds 20 percent. The American official said a national census expected to be taken next year should determine the share of revenue that goes to each province or region.If doing a census next year is too politically fraught, or if security conditions prevent it, then revenues could be distributed to provincial or regional governments according to the household counts used by Mr. Hussein’s government to distribute rations in the 1990s.The Kurds have insisted that revenues collected by the central government should be put into an account that automatically redistributes the money into sub-accounts dedicated to the provinces or regions. This approach could be written into the national oil law or into a separate law, the American official said.The working draft of the oil law re-establishes the state-run Iraq National Oil Company, which was founded in 1964 to oversee oil production but was shut down by Mr. Hussein in 1987. The company would operate using a business model and not through a government budget process. Iraqi and American officials say that would make management of oil production more efficient and separate it from the Oil Ministry, which has been rife with corruption.The North and South Oil Companies, which currently manage production in their regions, would fall under the umbrella of the Iraq National Oil Company. Any exports would still be sold through a state marketing company.The law also sets production thresholds for creating new regional companies. A province or region, for example, might have to show it can produce 100,000 barrels a day before a company can be created there. Officials in Maysan Province in the south have already said they want to start a company.'"
"'06-12-09,'0','“Governor Romney believes Americans should be respectful of all people,” said Eric Fehrnstrom, his spokesman. “However, over the past four years as governor, Mitt Romney has not advocated or supported any change in the military’s policies and he has not implemented new or special rights in this area.”Mr. Fehrnstrom, echoing the language that Mr. Romney has frequently used on the campaign trail, said Mr. Romney had been “a champion of traditional marriage” and “fought the efforts of activist judges who seek to redefine marriage.”Nonetheless, the breadth of the letter’s language and the specificity of many of the pledges stunned conservative leaders. Many of them had turned to Mr. Romney as a conservative alternative to Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, whose position on issues like abortion had been considered suspect.“This is quite disturbing,” said Tony Perkins, president of the Family Research Council, who had praised Mr. Romney as a champion of traditional values at the group’s conference in late September. “This type of information is going to create a lot of problems for Governor Romney. He is going to have a hard time overcoming this.”Paul Weyrich, a founder of the modern conservative movement, said: “Unless he comes out with an abject repudiation of this, I think it makes him out to be a hypocrite. And if he totally repudiates this, you have to ask, on what grounds?”The letter, and Mr. Romney’s effort to reconcile it with the way he had presented himself on the campaign trail, reflects what has been one of the central challenges facing him in his campaign: how to move from winning an election in one of the most liberal states in the union to becoming the presidential candidate of a party whose nominating process is dominated by social conservatives.As it is, he has shifted his position on abortion rights. Last year, Mr. Romney wrote an op-ed article for The Boston Globe saying that his views had “evolved and deepened,” and that he opposed abortion and thought decisions on its legality should be left to states.The 1994 letter followed a meeting with the Log Cabin Club. Mr. Romney wrote, “I am not unaware of my opponent’s considerable record in the area of civil rights.“For some voters, it might be enough to simply match my opponent’s record in this area,” he said. “But I believe we can and must do better. If we are to achieve the goals we share, we must make equality for gays and lesbians a mainstream concern. My opponent cannot do this. I can and will.”Mr. Romney, recounting in the letter the promises he made in the meeting with the club, said he had agreed to help sponsor a bill barring discrimination against gay men and lesbians if he was elected to the Senate and to broaden it to include protections for housing and credit.He said he supported the “don’t ask, don’t tell” military policy created by former President Bill Clinton, and described it as “the first in a number of steps that will ultimately lead to gays’ and lesbians’ being able to serve openly and honestly in our nation’s military.”Rich Tafel, who was the executive director of the club at the time, said he was stunned by what he described as the contrast between how Mr. Romney came across in their meeting and how he appeared on the campaign trail now.“I’ve never seen anybody change like this,” he said. “It really does concern me.”Viewed from some angles, Mr. Romney’s positions on gay rights seem consistent. He still says he opposes discrimination against gay men and lesbians and he always said he opposed same-sex marriage.But his emphasis has shifted in the last two years. As he moves into this new phase of his career, Mr. Romney rarely talks about the need to protect gay men and lesbians from bias, instead presenting himself as a conservative stalwart in the fight against same-sex marriage, arguing that legally recognizing same-sex unions endangers the cultural support for heterosexual families.The doubts being raised could improve the prospects of two fellow Republicans who have been seeking conservative support in bids for the presidential election: Gov. Mike Huckabee of Arkansas and Senator Sam Brownback of Kansas.'"
"'06-12-09,'0','BAGHDAD, Dec. 8 — After weeks of legislative maneuvering, the House passed a bill on Friday extending the life of a federal oversight agency that will now have the authority to examine $32 billion in American taxpayer expenditures on reconstruction in Iraq through approximately 2008.A spokeswoman at the White House, Emily A. Lawrimore, said President Bush intended to sign the bill, which had been introduced in the House by Representative Ike Skelton, Democrat of Missouri. On Wednesday, the Senate passed an identical bill, sponsored by Senator Susan Collins, a Maine Republican, and by a bipartisan group of legislative allies.Mr. Skelton suggested that after Congress reconvened in January, he might seek to expand the authority still further, possibly going beyond physical and institutional reconstruction projects to money being used to train and equip Iraqi security forces.“More work must be done to ensure the oversight of all taxpayer dollars invested in Iraq,” Mr. Skelton said in a statement.The financial authority of the oversight agency, called the Office of the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction, had already been expanded in October. But in a provision backed by Representative Duncan Hunter, Republican of California, the office would have been forced to begin shutting down soon and handing its duties over to offices at the Pentagon and the State Department.Opponents of that move doubted that Bush administration agencies would be sufficiently motivated to investigate themselves, a contention that Pentagon and State officials dismissed. But after the bipartisan Iraq Study Group recommended Wednesday that the special inspector general be maintained for as long as American financial assistance was flowing to Iraq, there was swift action on the new House and Senate bills.'"
"'06-12-09,'0','BEIRUT, Lebanon, Dec. 8 — Lebanon’s prime minister, Fouad Siniora, lashed out Friday at Hezbollah’s leader, Sheik Hassan Nasrallah, in a deeply personal attack in which he dismissed the sheik’s political ultimatums for more power, saying, “You are not our Lord and your party is not our Lord.”The prime minister’s decision to go head to head with Sheik Nasrallah in a televised address was a risky strategy for Mr. Siniora, whose local and regional standing is nowhere near the outsized image that the Hezbollah leader enjoys. But it also reflected how Lebanon’s political crisis had spread beyond the bounds of political differences and entered the highly combustible realm of personal animosities between leaders.A day earlier, Sheik Nasrallah appeared in a live video feed on two large screens before thousands of protesters camped out in downtown Beirut, vowing to press on with street protests that have paralyzed the government and the capital city for more than a week. He threatened that if the governing coalition did not soon meet his demand to form what he called a national unity government — in which Hezbollah’s alliance would have veto power over all decisions — he would force the collapse of the existing government, call for early parliamentary elections and select a new prime minister from among Hezbollah’s allies.“Sayed Nasrallah’s speech was not aptly chosen,” Mr. Siniora said in response on Friday, using a title that indicates that Sheik Nasrallah is a descendant of the Prophet Muhammad. “He was trying to stage a coup d’état, or at least threaten to make one.”In striking back, the prime minister challenged the credibility of Sheik Nasrallah and Hezbollah — or the Party of God — a strategy that would have been unheard of in the early days after the war with Israel, from which Hezbollah emerged emboldened and declared “divine victory.” But Lebanon is now divided and angry, and its leaders talk about promoting dialogue — while ratcheting up a heated confrontation.“His threatening rhetoric does not lead anywhere and is not beneficial for the Lebanese,” the prime minister said. “It is one of the things that are making the resistance lose its popularity among Arabs and Muslims.”There are generally two sides in this battle. One, the Hezbollah alliance, backed by Iran and Syria, says that the sitting government is illegitimate because six Hezbollah-aligned ministers resigned. The other side, called the March 14 coalition, is backed by the United States and France, and says that Hezbollah and its allies are trying to stage what amounts to a coup.'"

"'06-12-09,'0','“Had I been appointed to an ambassadorship somewhere, I simply wouldn’t have had this opportunity to be selected secretary general,” Mr. Ban said.The full realization of this reversal of fortune comes this Thursday with his formal swearing-in as the eighth secretary general of the United Nations. He will assume the office on Jan. 1, replacing Kofi Annan, who completes his second five-year term on Dec. 31.Courtly and deliberate, with an easy smile, Mr. Ban, 62, is an unknown at the United Nations, particularly compared with the high-profile, globetrotting diplomat he is succeeding.With the exception of his misstep in 2001, Mr. Ban has been almost surpassingly unassuming and inoffensive — noticed, when he is, for his steady record of incremental achievement at the South Korean Foreign Ministry, where he has spent his entire 37-year career.The elusiveness may be intended.“When I was the foreign policy adviser to President Roh Moo-hyun, everybody was caught up in controversy with what they said to the media, but I avoided the tricky, sometimes nasty questions,” he said. “The press people called me the ‘slippery eel’ because they could never grab me.”A loyal and dependable company man, he once wrote handwritten letters of apology to 120 Foreign Ministry officials after being promoted ahead of them. “They were very much grateful for my gesture,” he said. “With that, I was able to lessen the sorry feelings of my senior colleagues.”His penchant for not stepping on toes and his repeated public expressions of humility during the months that he was campaigning for secretary general have raised doubts about his suitability for the job. How can someone with such a retiring manner lead an organization undergoing a hotly contested reformation, riddled with regional rivalries and subject to competing demands from the great powers and the nations of the developing world?ADDRESSING this concern in his acceptance speech to the General Assembly on Oct. 13, he asked that people accept his modest mien as a cultural attribute and not misread it as lack of decisiveness or passion. “Modesty is about demeanor,” he said, “not about vision and goals. It does not mean the lack of commitment or leadership.”In campaigning for the job, Mr. Ban presented himself as a “harmonizer and bridge builder” who would try to dispel the widespread mistrust of the United Nations.With the choice of each secretary general, the question always arises about which part of that title the new person will inhabit. Given Mr. Ban’s résumé and style, the prediction now is that he will be more a secretary, less a general.But the same expectation greeted Mr. Annan 10 years ago, and, to the particular dismay of the Bush administration, he ended up being more general, less secretary.John R. Bolton, the departing United States ambassador, left no doubt what the American hopes were for Mr. Ban, whom Washington backed vigorously. He repeatedly pointed out that the job of secretary general was described in the United Nations Charter as simply “chief administrative officer.”Mr. Ban was born on June 13, 1944, in Eumseong, a farm village in Japanese-occupied Korea, and raised in Chungju, a nearby town. His family lost its middle-class standard of living when his father’s warehouse business went bankrupt, and Mr. Ban was to spend his early years as a diplomat deliberately picking posts where he could save money to send home.When he was 6, his family had to flee to a remote mountainside to escape the fighting during the Korean War. “We were safe and in a place where neither the South Korean nor North Korean armies would come, but we were poor and hungry,” he said. “I could see the fighter jets bombing the towns and cities nearby.”The experience led to his first sighting of Americans. “After the war, the American soldiers would throw biscuits and chocolates and chewing gum to us, and all our clothes were given to us by America,” he said.A later encounter with Western ways occurred when American technicians came to his town in the 1950s to help build a fertilizer factory, and he still recalls it with shock.“I was startled one summer when I met for the first time one of the daughters, and she was sitting there with hot pants and her two legs stretched out in front of me, a young country boy,” he said. “I didn’t know where to place my eyes, where to focus. It would have been a matter of shame for any Korean lady at that time.”The eldest of six children, he was a standout student, applying himself with particular zeal to learning English. The method of study was arduous, with students required to write the same English sentences 10 times as a way of memorizing them.IN 1962, he won an English competition sponsored by the Red Cross and got a chance to visit the United States. The high point of that trip was a meeting at the White House with President John F. Kennedy, which he said first inspired him to become a diplomat.He married another high achiever, his school’s student council president, Yoo Soon-taek, in 1971, a year after he had passed his diplomat’s exam.The couple have two daughters, Seon-yong, 34, who works in Seoul for the Korea Foundation, a nonprofit organization that promotes Korean culture, and Hyun-hee, 30, a field officer for Unicef in Nairobi, Kenya. They also have a son, Woo-hyun, 32, who is studying for an M.B.A. at the University of California, Los Angeles.Mr. Ban is admittedly all work, no play.“When you ask about hobbies, that’s a question I have difficulty answering,” he said. “I regret, looking back at my life, that I have not been able to cultivate any extracurricular activities like playing tennis or soccer or football. The only sport I do is golf, but in the last three or four years, I have played less than 10 times.”In 1956, Mr. Ban was picked by his class to address an appeal to Secretary General Dag Hammarskjold over the Hungarian uprising against the Russians. But whether there is an interesting historical footnote here, Mr. Ban cannot say. “I never found out if they ever sent it,” he said.'"

"'06-12-10,'0','“O.K., Roman, 48 hours makes a tremendous difference,” Mr. Leinbach said. “The weather is outstanding, the vehicle is in great shape, so we wish you all good luck, Godspeed, and we’ll see you back here in 12 days.”After liftoff, the firing room erupted in cheers and applause, and Mr. Leinbach said, “Calm down now, we’ve got eight minutes to orbit.”Those eight minutes passed with exceeding smoothness. The crew and the launching team calmly communicated the milestones of reaching orbit: the “go at throttle up” call about a minute into flight as the shuttle passed through the zone of maximum turbulence; the separation of the solid rocket boosters; the main engine cutoff; and the separation of the external tank. Discovery was well on its way to catching up with the space station on Monday.Since the loss of the shuttle Columbia in 2003, liftoffs have taken place during the day so NASA analysts can look for the kind of liftoff debris that doomed that shuttle and its crew. This nighttime launching made it harder to make out any debris in the images from the camera on the shuttle’s external fuel tank, but those images and data from radar and other sensors will be scrutinized for signs of damage to the craft. “We’ll have lots of looks at it,” said LeRoy Cain, the head of the launching mission management team.The 12-day mission promises to be one of the most complex in the history of the shuttle program. The astronauts are to install a stubby extension to the station’s structure and reconfigure its electrical system to receive power from new solar arrays.The mission also includes a tricky effort to coax a solar array that has been standing atop the station for six years to fold itself into a more compact form, out of the way so that the new array can rotate to face the sun continuously.The work will prepare the station to generate the power it will need for the next rounds of construction and expansion, and to meet the needs of a crew that will eventually double to six from three. Spacewalkers will unplug and reattach 112 power connectors in the process.The rewiring is risky. Half of the space station’s electrical system will be powered down as its wiring is reconfigured, and then brought up again. Then, in another spacewalk, the astronauts will shut down the other half of the station’s electrical system. Crucial systems will remain online, since they can receive power from either power network. But some lights, communications systems and other components will be turned off during each of the two rewiring spacewalks, and mission managers have fretted about what might happen if those do not come back online.Then, after the power procedure is complete, the astronauts must start cooling pumps that will control the temperature of the circuit control boxes. The pumps have not been used in four years, and that, too, has managers sweating.Just two members of the Discovery’s crew — Commander Polansky, a former Air Force test pilot, and Capt. Robert L. Curbeam Jr. of the Navy — have been to space before. The rest of the crew members will be taking their first trip, including the pilot, Cmdr. William A. Oefelein of the Navy; Cmdr. Sunita L. Williams of the Navy; Nicholas J. M. Patrick; Joan E. Higginbotham; and Christer Fuglesang, the first Swedish astronaut and a representative of the European Space Agency.Commander Williams will remain on the space station for six-months, and Thomas Reiter of the European Space Agency, who has been living on the station, will climb aboard the shuttle for his ride back to earth.In the post-liftoff briefing on Saturday night, the NASA administrator, Michael D. Griffin, said the shuttle and the station were now part of a larger effort to return to the work of sending humans to explore the Moon and the planets.“We have to learn to live on other planetary surfaces,” Mr. Griffin said, “and use what we find there and bend it to our will — just as the pilgrims did when they came to what is now New England.”It is part of what it takes “to become a space-faring nation,” he said, adding that it is up to NASA to make that happen.“Sometimes we stumble,” Mr. Griffin said. “Today, we didn’t stumble.”'"

"'06-12-10,'0','All manner of infantry arms, from rocket-propelled grenade launchers to weathered and dented Kalashnikovs, have circulated within Iraq for decades.But three types of American-issued weapons are now readily visible in shops and bazaars here as well: Glock and Walther 9-millimeter pistols, and pristine, unused Kalashnikovs from post-Soviet Eastern European countries. These are three of the principal types of the 370,000 weapons purchased by the United States for Iraq’s security forces, a program that was criticized by a special inspector general this fall for, among other things, failing to properly account for the arms.The weapons are easy to find, resting among others in the semihidden street markets here, where weapons are sold in tea houses, the back rooms of grocery kiosks, cosmetics stores and rug shops, or from the trunks of cars. Proprietors show samples for immediate purchase and offer to take orders — 10 guns can be had in two hours, they say, and 100 or more the next day.“Every type of gun that the Americans give comes to the market,” said Brig. Hassan Nouri, chief of the political investigations bureau for the Sulaimaniya district. “They go from the U.S. Army to the Iraqi Army to the smugglers. I have captured many of these guns that the terrorists bought.”The forces propelling the trade can be seen in the price fluctuations of the country’s most abundant firearm, the Kalashnikov.In early 2003, a Kalashnikov in northern Iraq typically cost from $75 to $150, depending on its condition, origin and style. Immediately after the invasion, as fleeing soldiers abandoned their rifles and armories were looted, prices fell, pushed down by a glut and a brief sense of optimism.Today, the same weapons typically cost $210 to $650, according to interviews with seven arms dealers, two senior Kurdish security officials and several customers. In other areas of Iraq, prices have climbed as high as $800, according to Phillip Killicoat, a researcher who has been assembling data on Kalashnikov prices worldwide for the Small Arms Survey, a Geneva-based organization.The price ranges reflect not only a weapon’s condition but its model. A Kalashnikov made in a former Soviet-bloc factory costs more than a Kalashnikov made in China, North Korea or Iraq. Collapsible-stock models have become disproportionately expensive. The price ranges do not include the most compact Kalashnikovs, like those Osama bin Laden has been photographed with, which now have a collector’s value in Iraq and can cost as much as $2,000.In many ways, weapon prices provide a condensed history of Iraq’s slide into chaos.Prices began moving upward in the summer of 2003 as several classes of customers entered the market together, Iraqi security officials and the arms dealers said. Western security contractors, Sunni insurgent groups, Shiite paramilitary units and criminals who were released from prison by Saddam Hussein before the war all sought the same weapons at once.Kalashnikov prices quickly reached $200, they said. Since late last year, prices have been moving up again, as sectarian war has spread. Militias have been growing at the same time that more civilians have been seeking weapons for self-defense — twin demand pressures that pushed prices to new heights this fall.“Now the Sunni want the weapons because they fear the Shia, and the Shia want the weapons because they fear the Sunni,” said Brig. Sarkawt Hassan Jalal, the chief of security in the Sulaimaniya district. “So prices go up.”Mr. Killicoat put it another way. “When households start entering the market, that’s a free-for-all,” he said.The surge is evident across a spectrum of arms. Pistol prices have nearly tripled since 2003. Western 9-millimeter pistols now sell for $1,100 to $1,800 in the bazaars of this city. Sniper rifles cost $1,100 to $2,000, the dealers said. In the West, similar pistols sell for $400 to $600.Arms dealers say that rising prices have led to more extensive pilfering from state armories, including the widespread theft of weapons the United States had issued to Iraq’s police officers and soldiers.“In the south, if the Americans give the Iraqis weapons, the next day you can buy them here,” said one dealer, who sold groceries in the front of his kiosk and offered weapons in the back. “The Iraqi Army, the Iraqi police — they all sell them right away.”No weapons were displayed when two visitors arrived. But when asked, the owner and a friend swiftly retrieved six pistols, a rocket-propelled grenade launcher and three Kalashnikovs from a car and another room.The rifles and the grenade launcher were wrapped in rice sacks. He slipped two of the rifles out of the cloth. They were spotless and unworn, inside and out, and appeared never to have been used. They had folding stocks and were priced at $560 each.The dealer said they had recently been taken from an Iraqi armory. “Almost all of the weapons come from the Iraqi police and army,” he said. “They are our best suppliers.”One pistol was a new Walther P99, a 9-millimeter pistol that the dealer said had been issued by the Americans to the Iraqi police. It was still in its box.Glock pistols were also easy to find. One young Iraqi man, Rebwar Mustafa, showed a Glock 19 he had bought at the bazaar in Kirkuk last year for $900. Five of his friends have bought identical models, he said.When asked if he was surprised that the Iraqi police and soldiers sold their own guns, he scoffed.“Everything goes to the bazaar,” he said.He added: “It is not only pistols. A lot of police cars are being sold. The smugglers brought us three cars and asked if we wanted to buy them. Their doors were still blue, and police labels were on them. The lights were still on top.”Although the scale of weapons sales is unmistakably large, it is impossible to measure precisely. Sales are almost always hidden and unrecorded.Tracing American-issued weapons back to Iraqi units that sell them is especially difficult because the United States did not register serial numbers for almost all of the 370,000 small arms purchased for Iraqi security forces, according to a report by the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction.The weapons were paid for with $133 million from the Iraq Relief and Reconstruction Fund. Among them were at least 138,000 new Glock pistols and at least 165,000 Kalashnikov assault rifles that had not previously been used, according to the report.Lt. Gen. Martin E. Dempsey, commander of the Multi-National Security Transition Command-Iraq, agreed that weapons provided by the United States had slipped from custody.“I certainly concede that there are weapons that have been lost, stolen and misappropriated,” General Dempsey said. He noted that the inspector general had estimated that 4 percent, or about 14,000 weapons, were lost between arriving in Iraq and being transferred to Iraqi forces. Most of the weapons were pistols.The general said that he thought the estimate was high and that accountability was improving. A weapons registry was being created, he said. “Serial numbers are being registered,” he said.But the estimate of a 4 percent loss did not include weapons that were lost or stolen after being issued to Iraqi units. The arms dealers said this was the main source of their goods.The arms dealers described several factors that kept weapons flowing from state custody.Some have been taken by insurgents in ambushes or raids. Defections and resignations have also been common in Iraqi police and army units, they said, and often departing soldiers and officers leave with their weapons, which are worth more than several months of pay.Aaron Karp, a small-arms researcher at Old Dominion University, said Iraq resembled African countries that had had extraordinary difficulties with the police selling off their guns. “The gun becomes the most valuable thing in the household,” he said.“If anything happens to a police officer’s family and he needs money, he walks into work the next day and says, ‘Hey, my gun got stolen.’ ”Another weapons dealer, who Kurdish officials said had been providing them with weapons since 1991, said the latest black-market sales followed an old pattern precisely.Throughout Mr. Hussein’s rule, Iraqi Army officers were in the arms trade, he said, selling weapons to smugglers. This was how the Kurdish guerrillas kept themselves supplied.Now, he said, the smugglers remain in business, and their trade is made easier because the units often do not have inventories. “I am surprised sometimes by the numbers,” he said. “Sometimes they come by the hundreds.”'"
"'06-12-10,'0','The athletic department has maintained that it does not do scheduling for athletes, but the audit showed that someone with knowledge of the system had helped the athlete who received the four A’s and graduated with a 2.01 grade point average.“This ain’t over,” said Jim Gundlach, the director of the sociology department, who in the summer revealed Petee’s unusual teaching load to The Times. “That was my first reaction to this, looking at the academic characteristics of the person involved and how many classes they had with Petee and how much of it was during that last semester, and the grade-change thing was the deciding factor in graduation.”Gundlach said the student whose grade change was found in the audit was a scholarship athlete but not a football player.The grade was changed without the consent of the instructor listed for the course, the sociology professor Paul Starr. He said he did not teach the course to the athlete that semester and did not recall ever meeting the athlete.“It was a phantom student in a phantom class,” Starr said in an interview in his office this week. “The schedule was a very strange one. You don’t cook up a schedule like that yourself. There was obviously some kind of guidance and special allowances with someone who had that kind of schedule.”Starr said he found out about the grade change, which occurred May 12, 2003, only eight days ago, when he received an e-mail message as part of the internal audit. The information systems auditor who sent the message, Robert Gottesman, said the audit had nothing to do with the sociology department or the athletic department. It is not known whether the grade changes were widespread, but other sociology department professors received e-mail messages from the auditor this week.The e-mail message Starr received Nov. 29 said, “As part of an ongoing audit, Auburn University Internal Audit is reviewing changes made to grades where the documentation was signed by someone other than the instructor of record.”It went on to ask Starr about a course in the spring 2003 term, SOCY4300-001, an internship-type course known as field instruction. The e-mail message asked whether he was aware of the grade change and the circumstances that had caused someone else to change it, and whether he had been contacted by anyone about the change.Starr replied by e-mail to Gottesman that he had taught it one-on-one to “no more than three students over the last 20 years.” He also informed the auditor that he was not aware of the grade change submitted on his behalf. Further, he wrote that he did not enroll the athlete or permit the athlete to take the course.That semester, Starr gave a grade of incomplete to a nonathlete in the same course. That grade became an F six months later, in accordance with university policy for students who do not complete the coursework.Starr said that he would like to find out who had authorized the grade change but that he had heard nothing since replying to Gottesman on Nov. 30.“I want to know more about the circumstance,” Starr said. “If credit is assigned by my name, I should know the background to it, whether it was an error or an inappropriate act, because I’m the instructor of record.”The same week Starr received the audit notice, other professors in his department, which includes sociology, anthropology, social work and criminology, received e-mail messages from an auditor.The interim head of the department, Paula Bobrowski, said she was not told formally about the audit and was unsure of how many teachers had received e-mail notices. She did not know the nature of any grade changes or how many might have involved athletes.Bobrowski appeared surprised when she was told about the grade change in Starr’s course during an interview in her office this week.“That’s what’s good about having an audit,” she said. “We’re talking about academic integrity, and if it’s out of whack, I’m extremely happy that we’re having an audit. This will not happen during my term here.”Gundlach said the manner in which Starr found out about the grade change was similar to how he discovered problems with directed readings.Gundlach was watching a football game on television when he saw a sociology major honored as a student-athlete of the week.Gundlach never had the football player in class. He asked two other full-time sociology professors about the player and learned they had never taught him, either. That prompted Gundlach to go through the files, where he found that 18 players on the undefeated 2004 Auburn football team had taken a combined 97 hours of directed-readings courses with Petee during their careers. The courses included core subjects like statistics, theory and methods, which are almost always taught in a classroom setting.Petee, who declined to be interviewed for this article, had said that he did nothing wrong. He told other news media in the summer that his classes, which included 152 one-on-one courses in one semester, were the only way that he could keep up with rising student demand and a shrinking department budget.“I will openly acknowledge that I wanted to have more rigor in the classes, but, given the circumstances, I wasn’t able to,” Petee told The Villager, a weekly newspaper in Auburn, over the summer. “If I gave them each a 40-page paper, I would have had to grade them all. Was this an ideal way to do the curriculum? Of course not.”He told The Birmingham News in August that he should not have given a directed-readings course in statistics to Carnell Williams, a star tailback now with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.The National Collegiate Athletic Association received Auburn’s initial internal report, which included an investigation into the athletic and academic arms of the university. It can accept the university’s findings or investigate on its own.A spokesman, Erik Christianson, said the N.C.A.A. would not comment other than to say it had received the report.The report was also sent to Auburn’s accrediting agency, the Southern Association of College and Schools.Auburn’s findings, made public last month, showed that Petee made about 55 grade changes for students from January 2003 to the spring of 2006. The average for professors in the department in that period was 22. The report did not break down the number of grade changes for athletes. It also did not say that Petee changed grades in courses other than his own. Petee gave 24 incompletes during that period, 67 percent to athletes.The report admonished him for failing to keep accurate grade records, including those involving grade changes.“Dr. Petee’s lack of course records for some classes violates Auburn University policy on proper maintenance of class documents and records,” the report stated.Gundlach said that he felt the report should have been tougher on Petee but that he had been generally pleased with Bobrowski’s tenure. He said he told her of a professor in the department who had been giving unsupervised tests by computer for years.Bobrowski not only stopped that professor, but she also found and stopped another professor who had been doing the same thing.“There has been a substantial improvement in the academic climate at Auburn since this,” Gundlach said. “The Auburn faculty hasn’t felt there has been much support for them to bear up against the pressure of grade inflation until this.”'"
"'06-12-10,'0','Even as questions persist about capability, the missile defense program is pushing forward at a cost of at least $9 billion a year. About a third of that goes to the kind of operation that is based at Fort Greely, called Ground-Based Midcourse Defense, which is intended to shoot down enemy missiles while they travel through space. Vandenberg Air Force Base in California also houses two interceptors, but military experts say Fort Greely is better situated to interrupt the likely flight path of a missile from Asia or the Middle East.Just a few years after being shut down, Fort Greely, about 100 miles southeast of Fairbanks, is now the destination of about 1,700 people, including some 200 soldiers, and the rest defense contractors and family members. The base’s Brownie troop is at 16 girls and growing — Monday night they made root beer floats — just as the number of interceptors installed at the base is expected to expand to as many as 38.Now, in a region with barely four hours of daylight in December, there is a new espresso shop on base and an expanded PX that sells flat-screen televisions.Sgt. Jack W. Carlson III, an intelligence analyst, said he was assigned to Fort Greely before the Pentagon officials created the 49th Missile Defense Battalion. “We didn’t have a name,” Sergeant Carlson said. “We didn’t have patches. We just called ourselves G.M.D.,” for Ground-Based Midcourse Defense.Sergeant Carlson married another soldier and has bought a house in nearby Delta Junction, population 840. He said he heated his house mostly with wood salvaged from the spruce left after a wildfire.Before Fort Greely, he had been stationed in the Virgin Islands. He learned of openings in the missile defense program through an online posting, he said. “I’d been on the beach all my life, and it was time to see the snow.”Alaska has been crucial to American military interests since long before it became a state in 1959. Now, Adak, in the Aleutian Islands, is scheduled to become the home port of the Sea-Based X-band Radar, a long-delayed system built on a converted oil rig that is critical to the ground-based system’s ability to track enemy missiles.While the 49th is an Alaska National Guard unit, Colonel Hildreth reports to Col. Michael L. Yowell, commander of the 100th Missile Defense Brigade, based in Colorado.Colonel Hildreth said he was well aware of criticism that missile defense was far from a perfected program. He said Fort Greely operated in a balance between operational mode and construction.“We build a little, test a little,” he said. “It’s fluid.”A 12th interceptor will be installed this month. Last summer, however, when American intelligence learned that North Korea might be preparing to launch an intercontinental missile, much of the bustle of contractors on the site stopped. Fort Greely went on alert. The system that had struggled through tests faced the possibility of firing a live missile.“It got quiet,” said Col. Thomas M. Besch, director of Ground-Based Midcourse Defense for the Missile Defense Agency. “And all of a sudden no developmental activity occurred. You could feel in the atmosphere that people were on edge and ready. You were kind of waiting for something to happen, and it didn’t.”'"
"'06-12-10,'0','Regarding a question posed in “Woman’s Best Friend, or Accessory?” (Thursday Styles, Dec. 7), the reason many places do not allow dogs has nothing to do with whether we are a “doggie culture” or not.Many people have severe pet allergies that can require hospitalization after exposure. Many businesses prefer to avoid endangering potential customers unnecessarily — as well as the threat of a potential tort suit — by simply banning pets (other than service animals).These serious health considerations should, and do, outweigh the status benefit of allowing tiny pets universal access, something that those who sneak their pets in should consider.I wish that I could better understand the recent trend of anthropomorphizing dogs. Is this a reflection of our society?Our dogs have a better standard of living than millions of people in other parts of the world. I had two dogs growing up, and I remember their being thrilled with a dirty old tennis ball or a dip in the somewhat murky town pond.While I do understand the need for companionship, especially in New York, this dog obsession has gone too far. Have we isolated ourselves so much that we need dogs to start a conversation or meet people? Do we feel better about ourselves when playing dress-up with our dogs?'"
"'06-12-10,'0','The results encouraged Mr. Baker and his wife, Patty, to form a for-profit company, SecureGive, that sells the terminals for $2,000 to $5,000 apiece and charges a $50 monthly subscription fee. By the end of the year, they expect to have terminals in 15 spots across the country.The kiosks are fairly easy to use. After typing in a phone number and a PIN, users swipe a credit or a debit card. The terminals allow people to give to a specific fund, such as a building drive or a mission. Afterward, they dispense a receipt.At Stephens Creek, where services begin with flashy light shows and a Christian band jams out salvation songs, the embrace of technology has helped build a sense that this congregation is on the cutting edge.“We’re real. We’re in today,” said Dorna Adams, a church volunteer. “We’re here where society is at.”Baker compares this embrace of technology to the days of the Old Testament when people stopped offering sacrifices and started offering coins. “It’s the same now with bringing plastic,” he said. “It’s an evolution. And this will take root.”To placate churches concerned that parishioners may donate money they do not have, the company offers to build machines that accept only debit cards.At the Bel Air Presbyterian Church in Los Angeles, it was the price that was galling, not the concept. The church considered buying the kiosks before deciding to build a homemade version for a few hundred dollars, said Jeremy Turgeon, the church’s information services manager.“It’s still a theory whether we could do it or not,” Mr. Turgeon said, “but other churches have, so we know it’s possible.”In some ways, the rise of the kiosks is a natural extension of the online donations that many church Web sites accept. Phill Martin of the National Association of Church Business Administration said he expected even some of the most resistant churches to offer credit-based donations eventually.“Whether we’ll have an offering plate with a card reader one day, who knows,” Mr. Martin said. “But we’re certainly not far from that.”The real market, though, may wind up being nonprofit groups. Mr. Baker said he was in talks with people in New Orleans to set up kiosks around the city so that visitors and residents could donate to a rebuilding fund. And his company just reached a deal with the Oregon Ballet Theatre, which will unveil two of the kiosks in December during its “Nutcracker” performances.“The onus is on all of us in the business to explore new and innovative ways of encouraging private giving,” said Erik Jones, the ballet company’s marketing director. “We see the kiosks as a low-pressure and convenient way for our patrons to donate to the Oregon Ballet Theatre while they’re actually at a performance and still in the glow of what they’ve witnessed onstage.”The machines have not signaled an end to traditional collecting.At Stevens Creek, proceeds from the machines account for only one-fifth of the church’s donations. At a recent Wednesday baptism ceremony, volunteer ushers sprang to attention when called to collect offerings, ready to pass the basket.Even so, the modern-day donation plate in the church atrium usually grabs the most attention.Amy Forrest, 31, who drives an hour from her South Carolina town on Sundays to attend services, said she knew the church was the right fit for her the first time she saw the kiosks. “This church gets how I live,” Ms. Forrest said.She added that the machines made it easier for her to chip in her weekly $40. “If you give cash,” she said, “you think about it. And if you swipe a credit card, you don’t. It makes it easier to type that 4-0.”“And it makes it easier to break down to the Lord,” she said.'"
"'06-12-10,'0','Last season, quarterbacks completed 56.7 percent of their passes and compiled a 76.3 passer rating against the Giants. This season, the completion percentage is 59.2 and the passer rating 77.8Last season, the defensive backs had 12 of the team’s 17 interceptions. This season, they have 5 of the team’s 12.Last season, the defensive backs had three sacks and six forced fumbles. This season, they have two sacks and six forced fumbles.Coach Tom Coughlin does not like to compare one season’s team with another, but he said the secondary was one area that needed to improve if the Giants (6-6) were to make the playoffs.“We need, first of all, to play the coverage called, be in the right positions, maintain those spots, recognize the ball in the air, and when the opportunity is there to catch the ball, catch it,” Coughlin said. “Be sound, be principled, keep the ball in front, tackle the ball. Certainly don’t give up the big play is always a theme back there.”It will be a theme Sunday, when the Giants play the Carolina Panthers (6-6). Carolina quarterback Chris Weinke may make his first start since 2002 because Jake Delhomme has a sprained thumb, but the Panthers still feature the dangerous receivers Steve Smith and Keyshawn Johnson.Any secondary can go largely unnoticed when a team is winning. The best N.F.L. teams usually have a stout run-stopping defense, and shoddy passing statistics are often forgiven because many of the yards are meaningless, racked up late in games already decided.The best secondaries seem to be built on perception as much as statistics — jaw-cracking hits by the safeties, acrobatic interceptions by the cornerbacks.But the Giants’ secondary is suffering, in statistics and perception. It has been increasingly exposed during the team’s four-game losing streak, allowing 234 or more passing yards to a less-than-daunting cadre of passers: Chicago’s Rex Grossman, Jacksonville’s David Garrard, Tennessee’s Vince Young and Dallas’s Tony Romo.The Titans trailed the Giants, 21-0, in the fourth quarter before scoring on four consecutive drives to win, 24-21. Young completed 13 of 17 passes for 130 yards and 2 touchdowns during the comeback.The Cowboys scored 10 points on their final two drives to beat the Giants, 23-20. Romo was 5 of 7 for 49 yards on the first drive, then completed a 42-yard pass to tight end Jason Witten in the final minute to set up the deciding field goal.Demps was blamed for allowing the play. He got sucked toward the sideline, concerned about receiver Terry Glenn as Romo rolled left, and could not get to Witten fast enough.Demps, signed from the Baltimore Ravens, was expected to be a hard-hitting, ball-hawking addition. His play has gained little notice, except by his coaches.“He certainly can play better,” Coughlin said, dishing out rare criticism of an individual player.Like many N.F.L. defensive backs, those on the Giants seem programmed with an extra dose of defensiveness about their performances. It is probably because they receive a large share of attention only when they make mistakes, and because they are coached to forget their mistakes a moment after they occur.Such was the case with Demps, who, after Coughlin’s comments, found himself answering sharp questions about the pass to Witten, but not about the 10 tackles he made, or the interception he had earlier in the game — the only one by a defensive back in the past six games.“I feel like I did all right, 10 tackles and a pick,” he said. “But you know what? I’m never satisfied with something like that. One play can always hurt you. It is New York. You got to do better. I accept that.”McQuarters said that this season’s group had room for improvement, not in talent, but in communication and assertiveness. Players need to be confident enough to bark out the offensive formations as they see them, he said, to warn teammates about what they believe is coming.He also said that comparing last season’s secondary with this season’s was “apples and oranges” — and not just because the Giants brought in fresh produce. There are other factors, injuries and the pass rush among them.Last season’s secondary played most of the season without Peterson (who changed his name to Will James and plays for the Philadelphia Eagles) and Williams, who is a starting safety for the Panthers.This season’s secondary has been much healthier, but the Giants played most of the losing streak without defensive ends Michael Strahan and Osi Umenyiora. The Giants have 25 sacks, well off the pace of last season’s 41. It has to be part of any calculation of pass coverage.“Statistically,” Coughlin said, “you’ll see that with pressure, we’ve had pretty good days from a secondary standpoint.”But the Giants did not expect “pretty good.” They expected the Super Bowl. And if the secondary was one reason they did not get there last season, it is certainly one reason it feels nearly out of reach now.'"

"'06-12-10,'0','Q. Could other benefit programs help?A. Yes, but it becomes complicated.Many employers offer group disability insurance as part of benefits packages. In most cases, you must be enrolled for at least 30 days before the day of the accident. Such programs are mandatory for many businesses in five states: California, Hawaii, New Jersey, New York and Rhode Island.This insurance generally covers half to two-thirds of total pre-injury wages, often with a cap of $5,000 a month. Virginia Reno, vice president for income security policy at the National Academy of Social Insurance, a nonprofit research organization, said that this insurance is “typically reduced dollar for dollar by any other coverage you get.”If weekly workers’ comp payments max out at 40 percent of salary, she said, disability insurance would pay only another 10 to 27 percent, depending on your coverage. Employees may also buy supplemental insurance, which can provide an additional amount — raising total coverage to 80 percent.Craig Dedrick, assistant vice president at Carpenter, Cammack & Associates, an insurance broker in Charlotte, N.C., said that repetitive stress injuries might not be covered under some disability insurance policies. “When it’s a soft injury, when you can’t see broken bone, employers and insurers are skeptical,” he said.Q. If you’re not recovering quickly, what are your options?A. Depending on where you live, your initial workers’ compensation coverage usually lasts for up to six months, at which point other forms of workers’ compensation coverage may kick in. Benefits from the Social Security Administration may also be available if you have been out of work at least five months and expect to be out at least a year.Etti Baranoff, associate professor of insurance and finance at Virginia Commonwealth University in Richmond, said employees seeking these Social Security benefits must prove that they are unable to do work of any kind. “This is the most stringent definition of an inability to work,” said Ms. Baranoff, author of “Risk Management and Insurance” (Wiley, 2003). These benefits are available whether or not your injury happened at work, but the claims process can stretch on for many months, and you may need a lawyer to prove that you qualify.In rare cases — when a work-related injury necessitates years of physical therapy or ends a career — an employee may qualify for both Social Security and workers’ comp benefits. Ms. Reno said federal law prohibited these combined benefits from exceeding 80 percent of the pre-injury wage.Q. Once you start feeling better, should you ease your way back into work?A. First, get clearance from your doctor. If the doctor says you’re ready only for light duty, you may want to ask your employer whether your job can be modified.Still, such transitional duty may have financial consequences, said Rebecca Shafer, president of Amaxx Risk Solutions, a consulting firm in Mansfield, Conn. Your employer may not want to pay full-time wages for part-time work and your insurance may not cover the gap.Q. Can you lose your job while you’re recovering from a work-related injury?A. In many cases, yes. Frank Melton, a partner at the law firm Rutter Hobbs & Davidoff in Century City, Calif., says employers may not be obliged to guarantee that an injured worker’s job will be available when the worker returns. In some cases, employees may be protected under the Americans With Disabilities Act, but Mr. Melton noted that if injured employees could not perform essential functions of their jobs with reasonable accommodation, or there were no other positions for which they were qualified, they could be let go.He added that in most states, before firing a recuperating employee who was injured on the job, employers must first prove that they could not function effectively with temporary workers.“If a position is so technical and difficult that it just isn’t viable for a temp, an employer may be able to make a move,” he said.'"
"'06-12-10,'0','To proponents of dividend investing, who have been growing in numbers lately, this performance gap may seem a discouraging development. Yet this is no time to turn your back on dividends. In fact, you could argue that dividend-paying stocks are just doing what they were designed to do.Because of their payouts, dividend-issuing stocks are far less volatile, on average, than stocks that rely solely on capital appreciation. “Dividends function sort of like anchors,” said Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S.& P. “This means that during good times, stocks that pay dividends don’t go up as much. But when times are bad, they don’t go down as much.”When the broad stock market was hammered in July, the shares of nonpayers tumbled 4.3 percent, on average. But dividend-issuing stocks lost only 0.6 percent in total return.Avoiding big short-term losses, of course, is just as important — if not more so — than hitting the occasional home run. Say you owned two different portfolios, both averaging a total return of 5 percent a year. The first, a group of dividend-paying stocks, gains 5 percent in Year 1 and another 5 percent in Year 2. The second is a basket of volatile nonpayers that falls 10 percent in the first year but advances 20 percent in the second.While both portfolios averaged an annual return of 5 percent over the two-year stretch, you would have earned slightly more in the first — by avoiding losses. In fact, $10,000 in the first portfolio would have grown to $11,025 by the end of Year 2; the same investment in the more volatile portfolio would have become just $10,800.That may explain why dividend-paying stocks tend to fare better over longer periods. For instance, this year through Wednesday, dividend payers in the S.& P. 500 were up 17.2 percent, on average, versus 13.9 percent for the nonpayers in the index.Moreover, since 1980, dividend payers have beaten the nonpayers by an average of 2.2 percentage points a year, Mr. Silverblatt said.The recent performance lag may offer a buying opportunity for dividend seekers.“Historically, high-quality dividend-paying companies trade at premiums to lower-quality companies that don’t pay any dividends,” said Jack A. Ablin, chief investment officer at Harris Private Bank in Chicago. That’s because, in the long run, investors are willing to pay more for the safety and stability of dividends.But the recent underperformance by dividend payers may have reduced this gap, Mr. Ablin said. “In essence,” he said, “the current environment allows for a free upgrade in your portfolio.”Investors also need to understand why nonpayers have been doing so well in recent months. Instead of climbing the proverbial wall of worry, stocks now appear to be scaling a mountain of hope.Judith A. Saryan, vice president and portfolio manager at Eaton Vance, said that investors “are anticipating that the Federal Reserve will start to lower interest rates next year.” As a result, they have been gravitating to sectors of the economy that tend to do best in the early stages of a new cycle.Not surprisingly, “the sectors that have done well lately are consumer discretionary stocks and information technology,” she said. And those two sectors happen to be the lowest-yielding sectors in the S.& P. 500.Technology in particular has been on a tear. Since the market caught a second wind on Aug. 11, tech stocks have returned 21.3 percent, on average, according to S.& P. That’s nearly twice the gain of the S.& P. 500. Yet only about a third of tech companies pay dividends, Mr. Silverblatt said.Investors are banking on future tech earnings. While profits for the S.& P. 500 are expected to slow considerably next year, tech earnings are expected to accelerate rather rapidly. In fact, Wall Street’s consensus forecast for 2007 earnings growth for tech stocks is 21 percent, according to Thomson Financial.BUT what if the economy slows more than expected and tech earnings grow more modestly? “I don’t want to say that tech is priced for perfection,” Mr. Orndorff said, “but expectations are high.”Mr. Ablin added that “any small changes in the earnings forecast could have a large consequence on stock prices; you’ll see huge swings.”We already have. Tech stocks have proved to be quite volatile this year. Consider the period from May 5 to Aug. 11. During this troublesome stretch, the S.& P. 500 lost 4.5 percent of its value. But tech stocks tumbled significantly more: 12.7 percent.“It would seem that we’re on a collision course between those who think the economy is just fine and that tech is the place to be, and those who think the economy is slowing down,” Mr. Ablin said.The question is, are you willing to bet the dividends in hand for the potential gains in technology?Not if you’re a long-term investor. You’ll probably want to hold onto those dividend-paying stocks.'"
"'06-12-10,'0','Q Are there any laws governing the installation of solar panels in New York City? If our board refuses to install a buildingwide system, can I install a personal unit on our rooftop?A Elliott Meisel, a Manhattan co-op and condominium lawyer, said that while federal telecommunications laws give rental tenants, co-op shareholders and condominium owners limited rights to install satellite dishes or other types of antennas in areas under the residents’ exclusive control — on a balcony or patio, for example — there are no laws in New York City that require a property owner or board to allow the installation of solar panels.“Even the laws that allow for satellite dishes do not give residents permission to install personal equipment on common areas of a co-op or condominium,” Mr. Meisel said. “The board has an absolute right to prohibit any installations on its roof or other common area.”'"

"'06-12-10,'0','As the war on terror enters its sixth year, its longest battle — over how to define the enemy — rages on. That there is a large difference between Muslims wearing veils and those wearing suicide belts may be obvious, but a clear understanding of that difference remains elusive.A team of C.I.A. analysts, however, has devised a new, and possibly potent, way of looking at the problem. The agency’s “Ziggurat of Zealotry” arrays Islamists into a pyramid in the Mesopotamian style, with each ascending level representing a leap in radicalization. At the bottom of the ziggurat are peaceful individuals who concern themselves with what some call the greater jihad, the personal struggle to be a dutiful and pious Muslim. Some of those individuals step up to join groups like Tablighi Jamaat — a missionary organization founded in India — that organize devout Muslims to effect change in their societies. Above that, you find groups with more radical political agendas, typically the overthrow or replacement of governments they regard as repressive and hostile to Islam as they believe it should be practiced. The next step abandons politics for violence exclusively. The top level covers only those who extend this mandate for violence globally and seek to destroy the Western nation-state system.The ziggurat is said to be the brainchild of Cindy Storer, an analyst at the C.I.A.’s counterterror center, who presented it publicly at the University of Pennsylvania in March. The model usefully implies that recruiters from one level draw almost exclusively from the level directly beneath them. It also implies that radicalization is neither fluid nor inevitable; radical Muslims are not destined to become violent. The task for counterterrorism, then, is to disrupt the “elevators” that pull individuals and resources up the ziggurat without taking steps to incur the ire of lower levels and nudge them upward.Since the ziggurat was developed, C.I.A. employees have given many briefings on it to staff members at other agencies and departments, though its logic, one former analyst laments, “has not yet been internalized at the highest levels.” But the emergence of the ziggurat, among other developments, suggests that an era in which “you’re either with us or against us” may soon be behind us.'"
"'06-12-10,'0','In August, Mary Ann Sieghart, a columnist for The Times of London, described her battle with the disorder prosopagnosia, also known as face-blindness. She can spend an hour and a half with a new acquaintance at lunch, “furiously trying to imprint his features on my memory,” she wrote. “Yet the chances are that the next time I bump into him, I won’t know who he is.” Like other prosopagnosics, Sieghart finds most human faces to be about as distinguishable as stones in a driveway. The disorder was first fully described in the medical literature in the 1940s and has long been viewed as an exceedingly rare, baffling derangement.But in a startling development in May, the researchers Ken Nakayama and Richard Russell at Harvard and Bradley Duchaine at University College, London, declared that as many as 2 percent of all humans seem to suffer from face-blindness to some degree. The team recruited some 1,600 volunteers and gave them a battery of tests. In one, the subjects were shown six faces, and then those faces were mixed in with others and the subjects were asked which they had seen before. Fully 1 in 50 of the participants performed as poorly on the tests as did the prosopagnosics whom Nakayama and Duchaine had already identified in the lab. In a study published in August in the American Journal of Medical Genetics, a German research team came up with a similar figure for the prevalence of the disorder, 2.5 percent, via surveys and interviews with 689 high-school and medical students in Münster, Germany.Face-blindness can be sadly debilitating: in some cases, parents can’t tell which kindergartner is theirs; sufferers become shut-ins, overwhelmed by a world full of blank faces. Before their diagnosis, many people with prosopagnosia assume that they are just socially awkward. “You have a perceptual problem, and you self-ascribe,” Nakayama says. “You say you are an introvert.” If the 2.5 percent figure is correct, millions of Americans may be misreading a glitch in their cognitive software — analogous to colorblindness — as a personality flaw.'"
"'06-12-10,'0','Breaking news: a new study shows that celebrities are more narcissistic than the general public.You wouldn’t be alone if reading that made you think, Well, duh! Everyone knows that. But you’d be wrong. Until recently, no one had studied celebrities to determine whether they’re truly narcissistic. Why? Because celebrities are shielded by public-relations people and managers who reject requests for things like personality questionnaires. Unless you’re Drew Pinsky, the University of Southern California psychiatry professor and host of “Loveline,” a syndicated radio talk show.Pinsky has celebrity guests on his show who talk about their latest projects while he answers questions from teenagers about love and sex. Over the years, during commercial breaks, he and his colleague Mark Young, a professor of sports and entertainment business at U.S.C., have surveyed 200 celebrities using the Narcissistic Personality Inventory, a widely respected questionnaire that measures narcissistic tendencies and ranks individuals on a scale of 1 to 40, with 40 being “extremely narcissistic.”Pinsky and Young found that on average, celebrities scored 17.84 — about 17 percent higher than the general public — with females ranking significantly higher than males. Interestingly, celebrities with the most skill (musicians) were the least narcissistic; those with no skill (reality-show stars) were, as Pinsky says, “off the narcissism charts.”When Pinsky and Young published their data, people said, Whoa, celebrities love themselves— what a shocker! But in fact, that’s not the case. “Narcissism is not about self love,” Pinsky says. “It’s a clinical trait that belies a deep sense of emptiness, low self-esteem, emotional detachment, self-loathing, extreme problems with intimacy.”The way Pinsky sees it, celebrities have a huge influence on us, and it’s important to know whom we’re modeling ourselves after. Young agrees: “We’ve all heard stories of celebrities in disastrous relationships; we watch them lie, cheat and get away with it. Drew and I just hope that people — especially kids — won’t try to emulate that behavior if they know that some of those folks may actually have an underlying disorder making them behave like that.”'"
"'06-12-10,'0','If there is one thing Adam Galinsky learned from years of studying negotiation, it’s that high opening offers lead to high final prices. Whether you’re looking at executives trying to reach a compensation agreement or neighbors haggling over a used car, the start-high, end-high rule applies. It’s an instance of the so-called anchoring effect in psychology, whereby value is judged (or misjudged) by the first number mentioned. So Galinsky, a social psychologist at the Kellogg School of Management, was intrigued when he heard that auctions might follow a different pattern.After conducting experiments and analyzing archival data from eBay, Galinsky and his colleagues Gillian Ku and J. Keith Murnighan concluded that given decent interest in an auction item, lower starting prices result in higher final prices — a reversal of the anchoring effect. Nikon digital cameras with the absurdly low opening price of one penny, for example, sold for an average of $312, whereas for all opening prices, such cameras went for $204 on average.Why does this happen? For starters, as the researchers explained in the June 2006 issue of The Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, low starting prices reduce barriers to entry, tempting even idle browsers to place bids. The increased traffic then generates higher final prices as more buyers bid against one another. Psychological forces play into it as well. Low starting prices entice bidders to invest time and energy in the auction, and while every M.B.A. student knows it’s dumb to base decisions on sunk costs, the eBay bidders did just that, escalating their commitments to their previous bids.Finally, the researchers showed that traffic begets more traffic because later bidders take the number of earlier bidders as proof of an item’s worth. “You see two auctions for the same shirt, each currently at $25,” Galinsky says. “But one has more bids, so you assume it’s more valuable.” What you don’t realize is that the high number of bids has less to do with the item’s value than with that auction’s attractively low starting price.'"
"'06-12-10,'0','For one brief, shining moment it seemed that TiVo, the ubiquitous digital-video-recording device, would kill the television commercial. Viewers, the thinking went, would mercilessly fast-forward through midshow interruptions, slowly driving them into extinction, until the networks blended into a glorious HBO-like paradise of seamless ad-free content.Then the commercial stood up and, jujitsulike, fought back by turning TiVo against itself.In February, Kentucky Fried Chicken showed on prime-time and cable networks an unusual television commercial. To the naked eye, it didn’t look terribly radical: a few firefighters sitting around the station cracking wise about dinner. But if you’d received one of KFC’s viral e-mail messages or read any of the 21 newspaper articles that ran the first day of the promotion, you knew the spot contained a hidden message. To access it, you could use your TiVo or any other DVR device to scroll through the ad frame by frame, eventually finding the one bearing the secret code that, when entered into KFC’s Web site, earned you a coupon for a free Buffalo Snacker — the crispy chicken sandwich that inspired the whole game.A lot of bother, perhaps, if you’re a busy person without much time. But KFC had someone else in mind: 18-to-34-year-old males with tight budgets and a marked devotion to electronics. “In the tech-savvy world of fast communication and blogging, word spread quickly,” says Tom O’Keefe, chief creative officer at the ad agency DraftFCB in Chicago, who made the spot. “It was the cool club to be in.”It didn’t hurt that the campaign carried the whiff of controversy. Subliminal programming on broadcast TV has been opposed by the F.C.C. since 1974, so it’s not surprising that KFC’s own “hidden message” seemed vaguely illegal — and, presumably, all the more enticing among the fast-food chain’s chosen audience. Within a week of the ad’s initial broadcast, KFC.com received nearly 3 million page views, and more than 100,000 people signed on to win the free treat. As of this writing, 300 million Snackers have been sold.'"
"'06-12-10,'0','Hunger makes the best sauce, goes the maxim. According to researchers at Yale Medical School, it may make quadratic equations and Kant’s categorical imperative go down easier too. The stimulation of hunger, the researchers announced in the March issue of Nature Neuroscience, causes mice to take in information more quickly, and to retain it better — basically, it makes them smarter. And that’s very likely to be true for humans as well.A team led by Tamas Horvath, chairman of Yale’s comparative medicine program, had been analyzing the pathways followed in mouse brains by ghrelin, a hormone produced by the stomach lining, when the stomach is empty. To the scientists’ surprise, they found that ghrelin was binding to cells not just in the primitive part of the brain that registers hunger (the hypothalamus) but also in the region that plays a role in learning, memory and spatial analysis (the hippocampus).The researchers then put mice injected with ghrelin and control mice through a maze and other intelligence tests. In each case, the biochemically “hungry” mice — mice infused with ghrelin — performed notably better than those with normal levels of the hormone. The finding was startling, but “it makes sense,” Horvath says. “When you are hungry, you need to focus your entire system on finding food in the environment.” In fact, some biologists believe that human intelligence itself evolved because it made early hominids more effective hunters, gathers and foragers.Horvath says we can use the hormonal discoveries to our cognitive advantage. Facing the LSAT, a final exam or a half-day job interview? Go in mildly hungry, not carbo-loaded for endurance, and snack to maintain that edgy state. Such advice, applied on a national scale, might help save our schools. Since overweight kids have suppressed ghrelin levels, Horvath theorizes that perhaps the obesity epidemic has contributed to declining test scores and other American educational woes.'"
"'06-12-10,'0','For years, cyclists who ride on city streets have cherished an unusual superstition: if they wear a helmet, they are more likely to get hit by a car. “I belong to an e-mail list for cyclists, and they complain about this all the time,” says Ian Walker, a psychologist at the University of Bath who rides his bike to work every day. But could this actually be true?Walker decided to find out — putting his own neck on the line. He rigged his bicycle with an ultrasonic sensor that could detect how close each car was that passed him. Then he hit the roads, alternately riding with a helmet and without for two months, until he had been passed by 2,500 cars. Examining the data, he found that when he wore his helmet, motorists passed by 8.5 centimeters (3.35 inches) closer than when his head was bare. He had increased his risk of an accident by donning safety gear.Why? You might suspect that cyclists wearing helmets are more prone to take risks. But studies have found otherwise. The real answer, Walker theorizes, is that helmets change the behavior of drivers. Motorists regard a helmet as a signal that the cyclist is experienced and thus can be approached with less caution. “They see the helmet and think, Oh, there’s a serious, skilful person,” Walker says. “And you get hit.”Walker will publish his findings next year in the journal Accident Analysis & Prevention. After a preprint of the article was circulated to colleagues, he was flooded with angry e-mail. Wasn’t he giving cyclists a green light to doff their headgear? Walker takes a more diplomatic approach. The mere fact that drivers are responding to a helmet means that they are making judgments, however unconscious, about cyclists. That means a government advertising campaign could retrain drivers to make the opposite judgment: a helmeted rider deserves just as much space.Then again, Walker himself has a dim view of pro-helmet laws and rarely wears a helmet when he rides. But at least now he has an excuse. During his study, he was struck by a truck and a bus — both times, of course, while wearing a helmet.'"
"'06-12-10,'0','The Mexican state of Chiapas may be better known in the United States for the Zapatista uprising there in the mid-90s than for its biodiversity or archaeological treasures, but that might soon change.Over the last six years, Chiapas — a southern state on the Guatemalan border — has invested about $18 million in tourism infrastructure, from new roads to eco-lodges in forest reserves. After a $70 million overhaul, Puerto Madero, its 30-year-old seaport, now called Puerto Chiapas, reopened in February with a deeper harbor and a new tourist pier to accommodate large cruise ships. Already 10 ships are expected to visit for the first time in 2007, including ships from Holland America, Royal Caribbean, Celebrity Cruises and Regent Seven Seas.Meanwhile, at least two American adventure travel companies, Mountain Travel Sobek and Austin-Lehman Adventures, are offering tours to the region for the first time next year. Weeklong itineraries begin in the $2,300 range and blend eco-tourism activities like river boat rides and jungle hikes with cultural excursions to ancient Maya ruins and indigenous markets.In its Consular Information Sheet on Mexico, the State Department recommends caution in traveling to Chiapas, citing “sporadic outbursts of politically motivated violence” from time to time and violent criminal gang activity, aimed mostly at illegal migrants along the state’s southern border.Tourism officials are quick to point out that the Zapatista insurgency has been inactive for years. In fact, the attention the movement brought to Chiapas is helping make their job a bit easier today. Because of the Zapatistas, notes Luis Valadez Coria, the under secretary of Touristic Development of the Chiapas Tourism Board, “the entire world knew the word Chiapas.”'"
"'06-12-10,'0','When the Abramovs were young, during Soviet rule, Jews were not allowed to go to synagogue or openly celebrate Jewish holy days, and there were also restrictions on property ownership.“My father was a religious man,” Mr. Abramov said. His father made the candles for their menorah and would explain traditions of their religion in secret, Mr. Abramov said.Mrs. Abramov, who had similar experiences growing up, added, “We believed in our hearts.”The restructuring of the Soviet economy, or perestroika, began in the late 1980s. Azerbaijan’s detachment from a central government and the ensuing social and government disarray meant Mr. Abramov, a mechanical engineer, did not receive his $100-a-month salary for months.The hardship grew after Azerbaijan and Armenia fought over the Nagorno-Karabakh enclave. Baku is located on the coast, far from the heart of the conflict, but the instability created a feeling that catastrophe could erupt in the city at any moment, she said.“Many people didn’t have a job, no money, nothing,” Mrs. Abramov said. Their concerns mounted for their daughters. “For young women, it was especially dangerous.”They also heard that people were being killed in Baku. More and more Jewish people were leaving to go abroad.Mr. Abramov worried that if he were to die, his family would not be able to find enough men to recite minyan, a communal prayer for the dead during the funeral ceremony. As the tanks rolled by, the Abramovs feared that the emerging religious freedoms would be snuffed out.They began making plans to leave. The couple applied for refugee status in Moscow. With savings, Mr. Abramov bought five airline tickets for $2,545 and obtained an $850 apartment for his family through a sister in New York.Their first culture shock here was meeting some Jews who were proudly wearing the Star of David around their neck. “I couldn’t understand how it could be done so openly,” Mrs. Abramov said.Through Jewish centers, they met friends and received assistance in adjusting to American life. Once such agency is the Selfhelp Community Services, a beneficiary agency of UJA-Federation of New York. The federation is one of seven agencies supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund.Last year, the Abramovs moved into their rent-controlled apartment in an area where many Russian Jewish immigrants live. They receive $1,008 monthly in Supplemental Security Income and pay $680.72 in rent.“Ask me about my current life. Now, I am in America,” he said, raising his hands up in the air. Mr. Abramov went into his bedroom and returned with an envelope that contained their American passports. The Selfhelp agency guided the couple through the citizenship application process and paid the $800 fee.Mr. Abramov’s eyes sparkled as he spoke about his new country and the knowledge that their children will have many more opportunities.“My children, they are treated well, and they are very smart,” Mrs. Abramov said. The family is happy, although Mrs. Abramov has developed severe asthma since moving here.“They don’t know why I have it,” she said, explaining that she uses a respirator three times a day and is on medication. On Aug. 11, their social worker from Selfhelp, Fran Tarshish, realized that the stifling heat in their apartment was inhibiting Mrs. Abramov’s ability to breathe. She drew $400 from the Neediest Cases through the federation for an air-conditioner. “I breathe much better now,” she said.“We can’t believe how many people help us,” Mr. Abramov said. “We came here and we did nothing for America and they gave us S.S.I. and everything. We are very, very grateful.”'"
"'06-12-10,'0','Mr. Lewis said New York’s average closing costs still led the nation last year, at $3,867, but that amount was based on settlements in New York City, whereas this year’s estimates were based on mortgages closed in Buffalo, where the average mortgage amount is far less and where mortgage taxes are lower.Slightly compensating for that factor is another change in methodology. The survey increased the mortgage amount on which settlement estimates were based, to $200,000 from $180,000, to reflect more typical borrowing conditions.Taxes and title insurance typically increase with the size of the loan, and other costs like appraisal fees can rise as well. The average mortgage amount climbed from $215,500 in October 2005 to $230,000 in June 2006, according to Federal Housing Finance Board, but in October 2006, it fell to $223,200.Because New York is one of a handful of states that require buyers, sellers and banks to hire lawyers for mortgage settlements, New York City feels the sting of high closing costs more than the rest of the state. “I know attorneys in western New York who’ll represent you for $500, while on the other end of the state it’s a discount if it’s $1,000,” said Greg Krauza, president of the New York Mortgage Brokers Association.Mr. Krauza contends that lawyers offer critical protection for borrowers during the closing process. But, he said, banks and title companies do not necessarily need the same service, because they already have considerable professional expertise. “That’s a big part of what’s driving the cost up,” Mr. Krauza said.Taxes are also a major factor. In Chautauqua County, in western New York, borrowers pay a 1.25 percent tax on the mortgage amount. In New York City, borrowers pay 2.05 percent on mortgages of less than $500,000 and 2.175 percent on those above that amount.In the Bankrate.com survey, Connecticut’s ranking held steady at sixth nationally.As for New Jersey, neither Mr. Lewis of Bankrate nor Gary Lehnes, president of the state’s Association of Mortgage Brokers, could explain its drop in closing costs, from fourth last year to 14th this year.One possible explanation is that more of New Jersey’s home buyers are using title companies to oversee the mortgage settlement, rather than lawyers. Unlike New York, New Jersey does not require a buyer to use a lawyer during a real estate closing.For New Jersey’s most affluent homeowners, one significant closing cost has risen, however, thanks to the so-called “mansion tax” enacted by the state last year. With that, buyers pay 1 percent of the total purchase price on houses that sell for $1 million or more. “Especially during the boom in 2003, 2004 and part of 2005,” Mr. Lehnes said, “we saw houses that had been selling for $800,000 go up over the $1 million level. So for those people, that can be an added expense.”'"
"'06-12-10,'0','New commercial development is part of the package, too; Flushing Town Center on College Point Boulevard and Queens Crossing on Main Street are two of several large projects to bring in more big-box stores. And by 2009, the Town Center complex will add 1,100 residential units as well.The new will go up alongside quite a collection of the older: thousands of co-op units in a massing of towers with building dates ranging from the 1920s to the 1980s, as well as a few single- and multifamily houses, which from time to time make way for the designs of condo developers.With all the people and businesses already in place, the coming growth has some worried about crowding and damage to small businesses.“It’s a real concern,” said Marilyn Bitterman, district manager for Community Board 7, which includes Flushing. “A lot of people don’t like change. There’s concern for congestion, and concern every time a new construction goes up.”The contours of downtown Flushing are somewhat vague. The area includes such a large variety of residential and commercial buildings that it is difficult to tell where the downtown ends and the rest of Flushing begins. But the central bazaar — where people pick up groceries, mei fun noodles, clothing, Vietnamese pho soup, plastic wind-up toys and shabu-shabu — is without question the intersection of Main Street and Roosevelt Avenue. There, one can find the No. 7 subway and the Long Island Rail Road stations, in addition to chain stores like Old Navy.As the major north-south boulevard, Main Street has traditionally been the line of demarcation between smaller single-family houses and apartment buildings to the west and large apartment towers to the east.In 1998, however, a zoning change permitted large-scale developments west of Main Street, and since then many of the triangle-roofed houses of the area have disappeared, with condo and rental buildings sprouting up in their place. The change is in clear focus on 41st Road, where an old yellow frame house is flanked by newish balconied apartment buildings.The local population is primarily Chinese and Korean, both native- and foreign-born, capped by a recent influx of Asian business people who have begun buying pieds-à-terre in the area. Yet the population, too, is in something of a transition.As Main Street curves south toward Kissena Park, several Indian and Middle Eastern businesses have opened, anchored by Patel Brothers, a branch of the Indian supermarket in Jackson Heights. With more newcomers to the neighborhood have come banks and brokerage firms, with at least one appearing on each block of Main Street.“It’s a financial district now,” said Alex Lau, a sales associate for Century 21 Milestone Realty, only half-jokingly. “We were walking up Main Street before, and we felt like we were in the middle of Midtown Manhattan at rush hour.”Rosilyn Overton moved from the East Village to downtown Flushing, into a two-bedroom co-op apartment just a block from the intersection of Main and Roosevelt, in 1986 and has no intention of leaving.“I’m in the middle of everything,” said Ms. Overton, 64, a financial planner who sits on the board of trustees for the Flushing Council on Culture and the Arts. “It’s really a vital, exciting community. You should not come to Flushing, however, if you’re not adaptable. It is a place for people who like to try new things.”She and her husband, Mardiros Hatsakorzian, occasionally travel into Manhattan for performances at Lincoln Center, but they have found that Flushing serves their cultural needs just fine, with jazz shows at Flushing Town Hall and the Queens Symphony at nearby Queens College.And on afternoons spent shopping, Mr. Hatsakorzian, who speaks seven languages, finds that he is able to converse in three or four of them.“If you’re an experience junkie,” Ms. Overton said, “it’s a fabulous place to live.”Just as many properties have sold in the downtown Flushing area this year as last, but in general, prices are down 7 to 10 percent, said Judy Markowitz, owner and broker of the Re/Max Millennium Energized Realty Group in Flushing.“People are getting more for their money,” Ms. Markowitz said. “Depending on the building, you can start to get three-bedroom co-ops for under $300,000, which was not happening last year.”According to Ms. Markowitz, two-bedroom apartment prices begin in the $180,000 range, with one-bedrooms and studios starting at around $130,000. And according to Kathy Tsao, a broker at Prudential Douglas Elliman, the highest prices for any co-op are in the $300,000s.As for condos, Ms. Tsao sold a two-bedroom, two-bath prewar apartment in the Yorkshire Gardens building on Kissena Boulevard in the late summer for $603,000, and a two-bedroom, one-bath apartment built in 2000 for $518,000. Prices per square foot in new condominiums range from $400 to the mid-$600s, said Mr. Lau of Century 21 Milestone, explaining that the variations depended on the amenities in the building and its proximity to Main Street shopping and transportation. He said demand remained strong.As for property tax, Ms. Tsao said, a 2,800-square-foot condo that she now has on the market for $895,000 would cost a buyer $4,992 a year.Rental studios are typically under $1,000 a month, with one-bedrooms only slightly more. Even two-bedrooms in luxury doorman buildings rent for less than $2,000 a month.Downtown Flushing is part of School District 25, which is well regarded by parents; test scores seem in part to bear this out. At Public School 20, on Barclay Avenue, 81.5 percent of students meet city and state standards on math tests, versus 65.1 percent citywide; in English, 76.4 percent meet standards, versus 60.9 percent citywide. At the nearest middle school, Junior High School 189, 60.7 percent meet standards on math tests versus 40.8 percent citywide; 49.3 percent do so on English tests, versus 43.3 percent citywide. At Flushing High School on Union Street, average SAT scores were 396 on the verbal portion and 464 in math, versus state averages of 493 and 510, respectively.There is also the Windsor School, a private junior high and high school known for English as a Second Language programs.Few in downtown Flushing complain about getting to and from Manhattan quickly. On express 7 trains in the morning, the trip to Grand Central Terminal from the Main Street station takes 25 minutes; on a local train at rush hour, it is just over 30 minutes. The Long Island Rail Road, which also has a stop on Main Street, is faster, at about 17 minutes to Pennsylvania Station. The X51, a rush-hour express bus, gets to Midtown Manhattan in about 25 minutes.What to DoEven without the chain stores set to arrive soon, locals certainly never want for shopping options. A walk down Main Street creates the temptation to pick up a few lychees, say, or maybe some dragon fruit.One primary component of the downtown area’s renewal is the Flushing branch of the Queens Library, a curving green-glass building built in 1998 at the triangular intersection of Kissena Boulevard and Main Street. And farther south on Main Street, the Queens Botanical Garden is experiencing a $12 million transformation, with several new landscape areas and a new “green” administration building.There are also the various attractions of Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, including Queens Theater in the Park, which is popular and well attended. Then, of course, there are Mets baseball games one stop away from Main Street and, just down the boardwalk from Shea Stadium, the U.S. Open in late summer.In 1657, when the Dutch governed Flushing, citizens angered by official persecution of the Quaker minority joined in signing a petition that came to be known as the Flushing Remonstrance. Local historians today see the document as the first organized defense of religious freedom in the New World.Flushing did not take on significant size until the expansion of the railroads into the area in the late 19th century.The downtown hit a low point in the 1960s and ’70s, until Asian businesses moved onto Main Street, and Asian residents invested in the community.What We LikeFlushing’s variety is endless, and not just in its choices of food; it is a not-so-micro microcosm of New York, and for that it is celebrated by locals.The dense foot traffic on Main Street and Roosevelt Avenue will only increase as Flushing’s new residential and commercial buildings arrive; sidewalks may need widening to accommodate the coming throngs.'"

"'06-12-11,'1','The campaign is indicative of the continuing appeal on Madison Avenue of the celebrity endorsement, a marketing mainstay that dates back more than a century to a time when Lillian Russell appeared in ads for Coca-Cola.A relatively new development is the rise of the semicelebrity or quasi celebrity, who may not be familiar to a broad, mainstream audience but is well known to certain niche markets that advertisers seek to target.For example, liquor brands hoping to cultivate cachet among younger consumers who spend freely when they go out at night use hip artists, musicians and other denizens of the downtown demimonde in their campaigns. They are not stars or celebrities in the traditional sense of the word, but are famous to the intended audience for the ads.In this instance, the target market is consumers who are serious enough about movies to be interested in downloading them – men and women ages 25 to 54, particularly those in their 30's. They are likely to recognize not only the actors who appear in the films they like, but also the movers and shakers behind the scenes, like the directors.The decision by Movielink and Donat/Wald to acknowledge the directors thus becomes a way for the service to offer its bona fides as a film expert. The goal is to differentiate Movielink from a horde of competitors that enable computer users to download movies to rent or buy.The rivals include Amazon.com, Apple and CinemaNow as well as newcomers like a partnership between Blockbuster and Wal-Mart Stores.""Downloading anything off the Internet is no longer an unknown concept,"" says Mary Coller Albert, chief marketing officer at Movielink, which is also based in Santa Monica, particularly among ""the consumer who’s tech savvy and interested in consuming media.""It was Donat/Wald that came up with the idea to use the directors, Ms. Coller Albert says, to communicate that Movielink is ""easy to use, gives consumers a lot of choice and selection and gives them control of the medium.""""In this field, directors are in control,"" she adds.""Having the directors represent us seemed like a natural fit,"" Ms. Coller Albert says, ""because Movielink is more than just a site to download movies from; it's about movies, movies as art.""Other features of the Movielink Web site (movielink.com) include reviews, staff recommendations of movies to watch, lists of what other customers are renting and buying and a newsletter.Donat/Wald worked with a casting agent, Mindy Marin, to find directors who wanted to appear in the commercials and would tell interesting stories of their careers. Ms. Marin has worked with some of the directors in the spots, including Ms. Hardwicke.""We wondered if we were being overambitious"" in asking directors to take part in the campaign, says Lucas Donat, chief executive at Donat/Wald, because ""they make big movies to be watched on big screens"" and Movielink ""by definition was created so people can watch movie content on their computers.""But the pedigree of Movielink’s founders helped win over the directors, Mr. Donat says, in that if ""there’s an inevitability to watching movies on computer,"" Movielink is ""a company created by filmmakers to protect the integrity of the filmmaking experience in the downloading environment.""The directors chosen for the campaign represent ""a nice cross-section"" of the craft, Mr. Donat says, and they spoke freely about their work. Two directors filmed the commercials: Amy Hill and Chris Riess, a team from a company in Santa Monica called Gartner.Mr. Donat says he was pleased to find on the day Mr. Apted's commercial was to be filmed that Ms. Hill was directing it.""I direct myself,"" Mr. Donat explains, and it would have been ""totally intimidating"" to work on Mr. Apted's spot because ""he directed my favorite movie of all time, 'Coal Miner’s Daughter.'""Mr. Hopper ""was fascinating,"" says Mr. Donat, who was also on hand to watch the filming of his spots. Ms. Coller Albert recalls that Mr. Hopper ""talked about what it was like starting out when he was an actor, in 'Giant' and 'Rebel Without a Cause.'""Mr. Hopper appears in two commercials in the campaign, 30 and 60 seconds long.""I’ve gone through so many changes in my life, I don’t have a clue who I am,"" he says, ""so good luck when you try to figure that out."" He also observes: ""If you have great actors who had bad reputations for being jumpy and getting angry, generally it’s because the people working with them don’t understand the work.""Mr. Apted, in his commercial, says that for a director, ""Every day is full of those frustrations,"" among them ""I should have done another take"" and ""Oh my God, why didn’t I ask that?""After the movie is completed, he adds, ""there’s nothing you can do about it.""Ms. Hardwicke, in her spot, recalls that when she was a child, she played a game called ""'Nothing can stop me,'"" adding, ""That’s pretty much my motto as a director.""The Messrs. Marshall are glimpsed in an office. Garry Marshall looks at a tchotchke on a desk that appears to be a small rock.""This is the myth of Sisyphus,"" Scott Marshall says. ""Is that what it feels like to make a movie? Push the rock up the hill and it rolls back every day?""His father chimes in, describing how at the start of each day, ""you have no rock; the rock’s down here"" and you must walk ""down the hill to pick up the rock"" and push it uphill again.The cable networks running the commercials include BBC America, Comedy Central, DIY, E!, ESPN Classic, G4, MSNBC, MTV, Reelz Channel, Style and TLC. The spots can also be watched at movielink.com.Banner ads promoting the campaign are appearing on Web sites like AOL, AtomFilms, ew.com (Entertainment Weekly) and Shockwave.As for what may come next, Ms. Coller Albert says there could be commercials with additional directors or spots featuring other figures involved in the movie-making process.Mr. Donat says that while directors ""tell fascinating tales"" and ""embrace the brand with credibility,"" there is ""just a ton of stuff you can do from an insider’s perspective.""Perhaps a next round of commercials will shine a spotlight on mysterious types like best boys, gaffers, foley mixers and focus pullers.If you like In Advertising, be sure to read the Advertising column that appears Monday through Friday in the Business Day section of The New York Times newspaper.'"

"'06-12-11,'1','LONDON, Dec. 11 — Terminal operations at six American seaports were sold today by the Middle Eastern company that briefly controlled them, closing a controversial chapter in American security and foreign policy.The company, DP World — based in Dubai, one of the United Arab Emirates — said today that it had agreed to sell all its United States holdings, including the 6 terminal operations, cargo-handling businesses at 16 American ports and the passenger-ship terminal in New York City, to a subsidiary of the American International Group, the giant American insurance company.The six terminal operations include the ports of New York, Newark, Baltimore, Philadelphia, Tampa and New Orleans. DP World, which is owned by the Dubai government, acquired the leases and operating contracts for the six ports in February when it bought a British port and shipping company, Peninsular and Oriental Holdings, for $6.8 billion.The deal prompted an immediate storm of criticism from American politicians of both parties, who claimed that it threatened national security and was being rushed through without proper regulatory scrutiny. Their objections were based in part on the fact that several of the Sept. 11 hijackers moved through the United Arab Emirates before coming to the United States, and made use of its banking system.Faced with lawmakers’ threats to block the entire Peninsular and Oriental deal, DP World agreed in March to seek a buyer for the American operations, which represented about 10 percent of the British company. DP World said today that it received several bids and that A.I.G.’s was highest.'"
"'06-12-11,'1','A summary of the top stories in Russian newspapers on Monday.MASKED AGENTS INVOLVED IN POISONING? Mikhail Trepashkin, an imprisoned former agent from the Federal Security Service or F.S.B., released a statement through The Sunday Telegraph in which he claimed a former F.S.B. colonel poisoned Alexander V. Litvinenko, a former F.S.B. agent who died last month. The agent in question, Mr. Trepashkin said, appeared masked alongside Mr. Litvinenko in a 1998 news conference called to reveal a F.S.B. plot to kill Boris A. Berezovsky, a Russian businessman, currently in exile in London. Rossiiskaya Gazeta said that of the two men who appeared in masks before the media, one was definitely Andrei K. Lugovoi and the other may have been Dmitri V. Kovtun. Both men met with Mr. Litvinenko on the day he was allegedly poisoned and are currently being questioned by Russian and British investigators.PUTIN OUTLINES NEW ENERGY STRATEGY: In his regular meeting with the Security Council on Saturday, President Vladimir V. Putin discussed the new government strategy for the development of the Russian shelf. The resource-rich, offshore shelf may become Russia’s main energy base in the 21st century. Under the new strategy, the government would do away with production-sharing agreements and rely on its own resources, possibly creating a new state-run company devoted only to extracting the shelf’s resources. The newspaper wrote that foreign companies already operating on the shelf could expect more inspections and greater hassles in light of the strategy.NATIONALIST CONGRESS REVIVED: The revitalized Congress of Russian Communities held its first meeting on Saturday, voting Dmitri O. Rogozin, the former head of the Rodina Party, as its new leader. At the meeting, Mr. Rogozin tasked the Congress, made up of disaffected former Rodina and Liberal Democratic Party members and other nationalists, with creating an ethnic Russian workers’ union and human rights organization, as well as drafting a list of Russophobes. Above all, members criticized the Kremlin for ignoring the interests of ethnic Russian people.FIRE EPIDEMIC: Fires in two different Russian medical institutions on Saturday killed a total of 54 people and left dozens injured. Officials investigating the fires at a drug rehabilitation facility in Moscow and a psychoneurological center in the Kemerovsky region suspected arson, the newspaper said, but blamed administrative staff for negligence. There were no injuries after another fire in a psychoneurological center in the Tver region on Saturday.BREAKAWAY ELECTIONS: Voters in the breakaway Moldovan region of Transnistria re-elected their president, Igor Smironov, in elections that the Organization for Cooperation and Security in Europe, the United States and the European Union declared illegitimate. Kiev broke from its previous support of Moldova and joined Moscow in supporting the elections after reaching a joint agreement on Transnistria when Ukraine’s prime minister visited Moscow recently. On Friday, Moldova’s Foreign Ministry sent communiqués to all diplomatic missions and international organizations calling the elections undemocratic and illegitimate.ARMENIA OPENS TO NATO: Armenia’s minister of foreign affairs signed a memorandum of cooperation with NATO at the end of last week on easing transit regulations between Armenia and NATO members. NATO’s secretary general called the agreement a first step in the realization of an Individual Partnership Action Plan between NATO and Armenia. Also last week, Armenia’s deputy foreign minister, speaking at a conference entitled “Armenia-NATO: A New Call for Partnership,” said cooperation with NATO was one of Armenia’s foreign policy priorities.'"

"'06-12-11,'1','A married couple, who are formerly of Queens and had moved to South Carolina in 2001, were reported missing to the local police in South Carolina after they failed to arrive in New York for a visit, their relatives said yesterday. The couple, Wayne Guay, 57, a former employee of the city’s Sanitation Department, and Dianne Guay, 55, a former employee of the city’s Department of Education, were believed to have left their home in Myrtle Beach, S.C., about 4 a.m. on Thursday in a four-door, white Mazda sedan with a South Carolina license plate, “732-RZZ,” according to the Horry County Police Department. Their relatives became concerned after the couple did not answer their cellphone during the trip and did not arrive in Ridgewood on Thursday evening. “We think there’s foul play involved because he had a lot of cash, coins and Christmas presents in the back seat,” said Megan Liendo, 27, the couple’s daughter. Ms. Liendo, who flew to South Carolina on Friday to help search for her parents, added that Mr. Guay was a diabetic. “We need a helicopter and people in all those different states to search for them,” Ms. Liendo said. “Something’s obviously wrong.”'"
"'06-12-11,'1','Young, who led the Titans to a 28-22 victory over Houston earlier this year, once again showed up the team that passed him over in the draft. Houston chose defensive end Mario Williams with the No. 1 overall pick because it already had quarterback David Carr.“You don’t say it’s personal, but this was kind of personal because the team went out and went against everyone and got the defensive player” in the draft, Texans defensive end N. D. Kalu said. “This was our chance to prove to the city that we made the right choice.”But once again they were not able to do it.Two weeks ago, the Titans (6-7) rallied from a 21-0 deficit in the final nine and a half minutes to beat the Giants. Last week, Rob Bironas’s 60-yard field goal in the final seconds beat Indianapolis.This time they only had to rally from an 8-point deficit.“Once again, like in the last month, every Sunday, I stand up here and say, ‘Wow, we found another way to do it,’ ” Titans Coach Jeff Fisher said.Young’s winning score came on third-and-14; the Titans’ great field position came thanks to a 36-yard kickoff return by Pacman Jones.Young, who became a Texas legend after leading the Longhorns to the national title last season, was 19 of 29 for 218 yards passing and he ran for an additional 86 yards.“It was a great ending, just being from Houston,” Young said. “And then being in front of my family — it doesn’t get any better than that.”Carr and the Texans (4-9) had a chance to regain the lead late in regulation, but stalled and settled for a 46-yard field goal by Kris Brown that tied the game, 20-20, with 2 minutes 9 seconds remaining. The Texans got the ball back in the final moments of the fourth quarter, but chose to run out the clock.“It’s an empty feeling. It’s a loss,” Carr said, “but we’ve got to move on. We can’t just hang our heads.”After the draft, still stung by the Texans’ decision not to pick him, Young said he was looking forward to returning to Houston and beating the Texans. On Sunday, he was decidedly more subdued about the subject when asked if the game was personal.“Somewhat and somewhat not. I really feel like the Tennessee Titans are the hometown team — the Oilers,” said Young, referring to the Tennessee franchise’s name when it was in Houston.The Titans trailed, 14-13, before Young engineered a 15-play, 88-yard drive ending with a 2-yard run by Travis Henry to give Tennessee its first lead of the second half, 20-17.Young and Drew Bennett connected earlier on a 39-yard pass that got the Titans to Houston’s 21. Henry cut to the outside and ran for a 9-yard touchdown three plays later to cut Houston’s lead to 14-13.Young was solid most of the game, with his only big mistake coming with the Titans down by a point early in the fourth quarter. He slipped and fell to the ground, but got up and threw the ball as he was being hit by C. C. Brown. Demarcus Faggins intercepted, but the Texans got only a field goal that made it 17-13 after the offense stalled once again.Houston’s offense did not do much until Ron Dayne entered in the second quarter. He handled the ball on eight of Houston’s nine plays and scored his first touchdown as a Texan on a 1-yard run to give Houston a 7-6 lead.Dayne helped the Texans extend their lead on a 2-yard touchdown on the first drive after halftime. He finished with 21 carries for 87 yards and his first multi-touchdown game since 2002, when he was with the Giants. Dayne ran for 95 yards against Oakland last week to help the Texans win a game in which they had negative yards passing.Carr was 17 of 23 for 140 yards, but was unable to come through when the Texans needed a touchdown.The Titans’ only points of the first half came from field goals of 41 and 33 yards by Bironas.'"
"'06-12-11,'1','Alan Pollom, the director of the Kansas chapter of the Nature Conservancy, called the question of conserving prairie dogs “one of the more vexing problems you can possibly come up with in the arena of wildlife management” because property lines tend to be incompatible with the prairie dogs’ age-old practice of digging new holes and expanding their tunneled colonies across the landscape.The anger at the large prairie dog town was sharpened when the federal Fish and Wildlife Service began to consider a proposal by the two ranchers to reintroduce the black-footed ferret on their lands. It is widely believed here that having an endangered species anywhere near one’s land means nothing but trouble.Mr. Haverfield, who is 70, and his wife, Betty, 71, are perfectly content to have neighbors and friends shoot some of the thousands of prairie dogs for sport. They just do not want them poisoned en masse. Neither does Mr. Barnhardt, who lives a few counties away and whose land Mr. Haverfield keeps an eye on.The Haverfield way of ranching — rotation grazing, a rarity in this region — is designed to mimic the patterns of bison grazing. By moving the cows from pasture to pasture quickly, he said, he can accommodate both cattle and rodent, improve the soil and the grass and promote the return of those species drawn either to prairie dogs’ abandoned holes (such as burrowing owls and badgers) or to their flesh (foxes, rattlesnakes, hawks and eagles).In recent years, as the prairie dog town expanded, “We’re seeing some species that we’ve never seen before,” Mr. Haverfield said, as his 1979 Ford pickup lumbered over some thoroughly munched grass and beneath a high-soaring golden eagle. “Other animals are affected,” he added. “The swift fox eats prairie dogs. So do the ferruginous hawks. And coyotes.”A few miles north, Byron Sowers, a neighbor of Mr. Haverfield’s, was busy with the wintertime weaning of this year’s calves. Mr. Sowers’s voice has been among the loudest of those demanding that the county do something about the prairie dogs, which he says are exporting their young to his land.“It’s devaluing my property,” Mr. Sowers said, raising his voice to be heard over the complaining calves.He does not necessarily share the other widespread — and, environmentalists say, unproven — belief that cattle break their legs in prairie dog holes. But because the rodents compete for grass, renting out grassland with prairie dogs brings in less money, the county appraiser confirmed. In general, Mr. Sowers feels about ranching near a prairie dog town the way urban parents feel about living near a halfway house.Mr. Sowers argues that his 900-acre property bordering Mr. Haverfield’s had only 10 acres of prairie dog town when he bought it. Now, he said, despite annual poisonings costing $2,500 or more, the colony covers 500 acres.He blames Mr. Haverfield’s rodents. He may well be right; the tendency of prairie dogs to seek new territory is well-established — although so is the tendency of the remnants of a poisoned colony to multiply quickly, especially during droughts like the current one.Jonathan Proctor, a prairie dog specialist with Defenders of Wildlife, an environmental group, is fond of asking why this native of the Great Plains, which once numbered in the billions, cannot be allowed a few thousand acres.“Maybe it is possible,” Mr. Sowers said. “But we don’t want it around us.”Mr. Sowers’s position reflects the common wisdom of 100 years of settlement in the dry western plains. An essay by Steve C. Forrest and James C. Luchsinger in the book “Conservation of the Black-Tailed Prairie Dog” (Island Press, 2006) describes how federal biologists in the early 20th century fattened their budgets by joining the farmers and cattlemen in a huge prairie dog eradication campaign.That campaign lasted more than half a century and killed billions of prairie dogs. In 1901, Kansas passed a law giving county governments the right to send poisoners onto private land, at the owner’s expense, if neighbors complained. That law is at the root of the current stalemate.More than a year ago, Mr. Sowers and other neighbors of Mr. Haverfield’s began complaining that the prairie dogs were out of control.At about the same time, Ron Klataske, the executive director of Audubon of Kansas, suggested the Haverfields offer their land to federal officials as a site for black-footed ferrets. Ten other ferret-reintroduction projects are centered on federal or native lands. That news inflamed an already tense situation. The Endangered Species Act’s prohibitions against intentionally harming an endangered animal conjured up fears that a dead ferret found on someone’s property could be turned into a federal case, literally. “Things happen to animals,” Mr. Sowers said. “Would I have to prove that I didn’t kill it?”Mike LaValley, supervisor of the federal Fish and Wildlife Service’s Kansas office, said that Mr. Sowers’s fear was unfounded.In February, Mr. Sowers threatened to sue the Logan County Commission if it did not enforce the 1901 law. Mr. Haverfield suggested a compromise, a 90-foot buffer zone of poisoned land, with an electric fence. The commissioners rejected it.Shortly before Thanksgiving, Mr. Haverfield said he had seen a man applying Rozol, a poison in pellet form, around prairie dog holes on Mr. Barnhardt’s land. Mr. Haverfield said he had run him off.In a defensive maneuver, the two ranchers decided to put their cattle around the prairie dog town. It is a violation of federal rules to apply Rozol near cattle.The county commissioners shot back a letter to the ranchers saying that if the cattle were not gone by Dec. 6, a new round of poisoning would begin, with an expensive gas that is considered safe near cattle. “What else can you do?” said Nick Scott, a commissioner. “This is something we have to control.”On Tuesday, the day before the deadline, Mr. Haverfield’s lawyer sent the commission a letter threatening legal action. All Wednesday, the Haverfields and Mr. Barnhardt’s daughter and son-in-law, three neighbors and two environmentalists kept watch. No poisoners came.They later learned why: the county commissioners were waiting to hear from their insurers’ lawyers. “We won’t do anything unless our lawyers tell us we can,” Mr. Scott said.Mr. LaValley of the Fish and Wildlife Service called the uproar discouraging.As for the ferret-reintroduction proposal, he said, “All I can tell you is things are not looking good.”Mr. Scott said this had been the most divisive issue in Logan County since the county seat was moved to Oakley from Russell Springs half a century ago.But Mr. Haverfield said his relationships with his neighbors had been affected very little. “I’m kind of a loner,” he said. “This hasn’t changed anything that much.”'"
"'06-12-11,'1','The “guiding opinions,” which were put into effect in the spring, require lawyers who accept cases that involve 10 or more plaintiffs suing organs of the government or the ruling party to submit to “guidance and supervision” by their local judicial bureau and the All-China Lawyers Association, which are under government control.They also must obtain consent from at least three partners in their law firm before accepting such cases, and they must refrain from “stirring up” news media coverage.The rules are part of an effort to suppress expression rather than to address the causes of social unrest, lawyers and rights advocates say.Although rapid economic growth has lifted hundreds of millions of Chinese out of severe poverty, weak property rights and poorly enforced labor and environmental laws have made China’s transition to a market economy painful for many millions of people without power to protect their interests.Lawyers, self-styled legal rights advocates and journalists have been the most conspicuous victims of a campaign by President Hu Jintao to create a more “harmonious society.” They have been accused of leading people to take to the streets over lost jobs, unpaid wages, environmental degradation, land seizures and other sources of discontent.After a rise in protests in 2005, including several well-publicized confrontations in which protesters were killed by riot soldiers or thugs, the authorities moved to prevent social disputes from gaining momentum.Luo Gan, a member of the Politburo Standing Committee who oversees police and judicial matters for the ruling party, said in an speech published in a state-run magazine that officials should take “forceful measures” against lawyers or rights advocates who use the law as a pretext to “undermine social stability.”State security officers and the police have arrested or intimidated people associated with China’s weiquan, or rights protection movement. At least four prominent lawyers and leading rights advocates, Gao Zhisheng, Chen Guangcheng, Guo Feixiong and Zheng Enchong, were charged with crimes after accepting politically delicate cases.Human Rights Watch said in its 70-page study of the conditions for defense lawyers that many faced less obvious but nonetheless serious threats to their independence. Their licenses are subject to renewal annually. They depend on the good will of the police, prosecutors and court officials if they wish to take even rudimentary steps to defend their clients.Several prominent defense lawyers, including Zhang Sizhi, who helped mold the profession after China emerged from the Cultural Revolution, have criticized the “guiding opinions.” On Internet sites for lawyers, the rules have been called the biggest blow to the legal system since lawyers won some independence in the 1980s.The government has defended the rules in the state-run media. Officials contend that they are intended mainly to protect lawyers and plaintiffs in delicate cases and to “safeguard legal rights.” Many lawyers and plaintiffs hold the opposite view.Human Rights Watch said China could not have an effective legal system until it respected the independence of lawyers and freed them from enforcing the will of the ruling party.'"
"'06-12-11,'1','Mangini’s mantra is that there is no time but the present, but his players were being drawn into the future all last week by people who were talking as if the team’s eighth victory was all but a foregone conclusion. Could the Jets have been distracted by the excitement they had created over the past month?“That might be,” Pete Kendall, the veteran left guard, said wryly. “I’m not Freud.”For whatever reason, the fine focus that had carried the Jets to victories in three of their four games since their bye week in early November was missing against the Bills. After two strong games, Jets quarterback Chad Pennington accounted for three turnovers that created more points (14) for the Bills than he was able to manufacture for the Jets, who fell to 7-6.Pennington, who completed 74 percent of his passes in the Jets’ previous two games (victories at Green Bay and at home against the Houston Texans) was intercepted with less than two minutes left in the first half by cornerback Nate Clements. The pass, intended for Jerricho Cotchery, was badly overthrown. Cotchery, an accomplished high school basketball player in Alabama, rose as if he were at the center of a jump ball, but he ended up tipping it to Clements, who ran 58 yards the other way for a touchdown.In the third quarter, Pennington lost the ball on a sack by Buffalo defensive end Aaron Schobel, who treated the Jets’ stout rookie left tackle, D’Brickashaw Ferguson, as if he were a turnstile all afternoon.Schobel, who had three sacks and nine tackles, had foreshadowed his success in a conference call with New York reporters four days before the game, saying of Ferguson, “He gets beat like anybody else,” and adding, “I just got to try and beat Brick or whatever you all call him.”The Bills’ Ryan Denney recovered the fumble at the Jets’ 18 to set up quarterback J. P. Losman’s 6-yard scoring pass to tight end Robert Royal four plays later.Pennington attempted 23 passes in the first half. He would finished with 22 completions in 35 attempts for 182 yards, his lone highlight a 10-yard touchdown pass to Laveranues Coles with 1 minute 8 seconds left in the first quarter that tied the score at 7-7.The Jets’ offense is predicated on Pennington getting rid of the ball quickly. The Bills disrupted the Jets’ rhythm by making Pennington hold onto the ball longer than he wanted to as he searched in vain for an open man.“I thought the entire defensive staff had a real good plan,” Bills Coach Dick Jauron said, “and the guys executed it well.”Willis McGahee, who is like kryptonite to the Jets’ defense, finished with his fifth 100-yard rushing game in as many career starts against the Jets despite sitting out the second quarter with an upset stomach.McGahee, a third-year pro who had a season-best 150 yards in the Bills’ loss to the Jets in Week 3, ran for a 57-yard touchdown to open the scoring. The run came on his sixth carry and with 4: 22 left in the first quarter. It was the first touchdown the Jets’ defense had allowed in the opening 15 minutes in eight games, since a 41-0 loss at Jacksonville on Oct. 8.McGahee finished with 125 yards, slightly under his 134.5-yard average in his first four starts against the Jets.“He hurt us today again,” Rhodes said, adding, “What can you say? If it wasn’t for the big run, it wouldn’t have been that bad.”Losman completed 10 of 15 passes for 157 yards, including a 77-yard touchdown pass to Lee Evans in the second quarter. The Jets should not have been surprised by the Bills’ offensive firepower considering that Buffalo had amassed 475 yards of offense in its 28-20 loss to the Jets in Week 3.The Jets took a 10-7 lead on a 30-yard field goal by Mike Nugent in the fifth minute of the second quarter. The seven-play, 14-yard drive was set up by a nice defensive play by Justin Miller, who stripped the ball from running back Anthony Thomas and recovered the fumble at the Buffalo 26.The Bills scored the next 14 points. On a third-and-3 at their own 23, Losman pump-faked, then threw the long pass to Evans, who caught it in stride. He was wide open, having faked out his defender, David Barrett.“It hurt real bad,” Barrett said, “because I don’t like to give up big plays like that.”Nugent kicked a 38-yard field goal with one second remaining in the first half. Pennington came out in the third quarter and completed all three passes he attempted, but the Jets’ first possession stalled at the Buffalo 43 and their second drive ended with Pennington’s fumble.Under Pennington, the Jets are one of the better teams in the league at converting third downs. But they converted only 2 of 6 in the second half. One of their failed attempts came early in the third quarter, when Cedric Houston came up a yard short on a run on third-and-2 at the Bills’ 39.Going without a huddle, the Jets lined up as if they were going to go for it on fourth down. With the shot clock ticking down, Pennington started to walk toward the sideline. The Bills’ defense didn’t budge, did not relax one bit, and the Jets ended up taking a delay-of-game penalty.That is the kind of day it was for the Jets. The Bills had every play covered. The more focused team won as the Jets were caught looking ahead.Kevan Barlow was inactive for the second consecutive week, the first stretch in his six-year career that he has been a healthy scratch.'"
"'06-12-11,'1','“Do you not recall that the weapons fired on Lebanon were American weapons?” he added.Prime Minister Siniora’s somewhat surprising expression of bewilderment seemed to capture the spirit dividing this country of just four million people. There are government supporters who appear afraid and threatened, and there are opponents of the government, particularly those who support Hezbollah, who seem empowered and confident that they stand at the threshold of victory.In a subdued ceremony that seemed a reverse image of the boisterous protests, several thousand people gathered to mark the anniversary of the assassination of Gibran Tueni, the anti-Syrian newspaper publisher killed in a car bombing last year. The front of the convention center was filled with Range Rovers, Jaguars and Mercedes-Benzes. Inside, the audience was dressed for a funeral, in suits and ties.“Everyone is afraid,” said Michel Khoury, a former governor of the central bank, as he left the memorial, a shiny new cellphone pressed to his ear. “The Shiite community is very important. It is the first time it is monolithic, the first time in the history of this country you have one of the communities united.”In Tripoli on Sunday, tens of thousands of pro-government demonstrators rallied.This fight between Lebanese factions, defined primarily along sectarian lines, is a struggle for control of the government that will help determine Lebanon’s future, and whether the nation eventually leans toward Iran and Syria, as the radical Shiite Muslim group Hezbollah would like, or toward the United States and Europe, as the governing alliance would like.“We are today at the last phase of our struggle before we consolidate our independence, freedom and sovereignty, because the government has proven to be a failure at all levels,” said Michel Aoun, a former general and a Christian leader, in a live video broadcast to the demonstrators in Beirut. “They have failed to isolate the Lebanese people from one another and we are here today to represent unity and we are leading this struggle together.” He has aligned his Christian party, the Free Patriotic Movement, with Hezbollah.He said that within a few days, the allied groups would press to form an interim cabinet and then for early parliamentary elections. There have been rumors flying around Beirut that the next step would be attempts to block roads, the airport and the ports, to grind the country to a halt. But there have been no official announcements.Hezbollah and its allies have managed for 10 days to control the center of Beirut with a loud, peaceful, organized protest. In many ways, Hezbollah has adopted a strategy that has been cheered by the White House in the past, in places like Ukraine, and even Lebanon, leaning on large, peaceful crowds to force unpopular governments to resign and pave the way for elections.But this time Washington and its allies have said the protest amounts to a coup d’état, fueling charges that the United States supports democratic practices only when its allies are winning.“Does Bush want national expression in Lebanon?” Sheik Qassem said to the crowd. “Do the West and Arabs want the voice of the people in Lebanon? Tell them, ‘Death to America.’ Tell them, ‘Death to Israel.’ Tell them, ‘Glory to a free Lebanon.’ ”The Hezbollah alliance took its protests to the streets after the governing coalition refused its demands to give Hezbollah and its allies more power, including the ability to veto all government action.The current demonstration began Friday, with hundreds of thousands of people pouring into the center of the city, many bused in from the poor, war-ravaged Shiite communities of the south. The government appeared to hope that the protesters would grow weary and go back to the negotiating table.But on Sunday, there was the huge crowd, a vista of humanity pressed shoulder to shoulder, flying flags and calling for the government to resign.The gravity of the situation was underlined by roads sealed by soldiers and razor wire, and the many shops and restaurants that remained closed.But high spirits seemed dominant. “I am having fun overthrowing the cabinet,” said Hassan Katteya, 10, as he walked with his mother, Reema, through the crowd.“We feel that we are the strong party,” Mrs. Katteya said. “The government is the weak party. They are hiding up there in the Grand Serail.”'"
"'06-12-11,'1','Apple’s ubiquitous iPod and its iTunes music store were intended to be a kind of perpetual motion machine, with iPods helping to sell iTunes and iTunes helping to sell iPods.Although both are successful, the relationship may not have worked out exactly as expected. At any given point, the cumulative number of songs sold by the iTunes store has generally been about 20 times the cumulative number of iPods sold, according to Forrester Research, the technology consulting firm. That ratio has recently crept up to roughly 22 to 1, as 1.5 billion songs have been sold. The figures were compiled from public statements by Apple.The numbers suggest that iPods are not driving iTunes sales as much as early supporters may have expected.“IPods are not sitting around generating dozens and dozens of transactions every quarter,” said Josh Bernoff, a principal analyst for Forrester Research. “People buy a certain number of songs, and then they stop.”'"
"'06-12-11,'1','The proposal will, for the first time, impose a “materiality standard” — that is, auditors will be advised to scrutinize only those controls that could have a reasonable risk of having a material impact on the financial statements. It is expected to encourage auditors to rely on prior years’ work as a basis for testing controls and discourage auditors from multiple testing of the same controls. And it will encourage the auditors to use a “risk assessment” to focus the audit on the areas of greatest potential concern.Commission officials said last week that the proposal would not be an unequivocal victory for smaller companies because it would not give them what they wanted most: a blanket exemption from Section 404. Nor would it impose a sharp restriction that would limit the auditors to looking at the design of the financial controls.But the officials said the proposal would address many of the cost concerns raised by small businesses.“It will squeeze out all the unnecessary cost,” said a senior official who was central in drafting the rule and spoke on the condition of not being identified. “What we really wanted was something that both tastes great and is less filling.”The commission’s action is being coordinated with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, a sister agency that will be issuing the proposed new auditing standard under the same provision next week. The new standard will fill in many of the vital details for the companies and their accountants.The fight over auditing standards has far broader political implications, according to officials, lawmakers and industry executives. An adequate resolution of the issue by regulators would take significant pressure off Congress to address other complaints from some business groups about the law and other corporate governance rules.Since the Sarbanes-Oxley law was adopted, small businesses have maintained that it imposed unnecessary costs and burdens. The accounting firms, which have experienced a sharp increase in their billable hours as a result of the law, have praised the provisions, while groups representing institutional investors have sought to prevent the regulators from watering down the provision in ways that could lead to more accounting abuses.“Sarbanes-Oxley was fundamentally about a whole series of measures designed to make sure that the numbers that corporations put out are basically true,” said Damon A. Silvers, who closely follows corporate governance issues as an associate general counsel at the labor union federation A.F.L.-C.I.O. “The debate over Section 404 has been critical to ensuring that purpose in two respects: first, no one should be able to sell securities that do not have adequate internal controls, and second, whether the system of oversight over the auditing industry was going to work. It feels today as though we may be getting both of those things right.”Some large companies have also complained about the increased audit costs, but new data suggests that the law is having beneficial effects for investors. A new study by Glass, Lewis & Company to be released this week shows that although financial restatements of public companies increased by 12 percent in 2006, they have actually declined by 25 percent among large companies. The study attributes the decline among large companies to the effects of Section 404.In recent weeks, federal regulators have described the overall framework for the new rules. They have been drafting what they call a “scaled standard” that they say will be flexible to the needs and characteristics of each company. A small company with complicated financial issues, like one heavily involved in derivative securities, for instance, might face more rigorous auditing of its controls than one of similar size with fewer accounting issues. Similarly, a large but relatively uncomplicated company might face a less rigorous auditing than comparably sized companies.The rule making follows weeks of behind-the-scenes negotiations between the commission and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board. Some officials involved in that process said that the oversight board, largely agreeing with the position of the accounting firms that it regulates, had beaten back attempts by some on the commission to loosen the standard even further.A central issue concerned the reach of the audit of controls. In a letter on Nov. 6 to Mark W. Olson, the chairman of the accounting board, Christopher Cox, the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, said that the focus of the audit should be on “the suitability of the design of internal controls.”The major auditing firms, as well as some investor groups, privately complained to the commission that that standard was too narrow and would send the wrong signal to companies. In response, the S.E.C. appears to have yielded and will propose a broader approach on Wednesday, officials said.Federal regulators say they have struggled to balance the interests of investors against the unnecessary burdens on small companies.“The Sarbanes-Oxley Act’s internal control requirements have been described as the most significant change in public company auditing since the advent of the federal securities laws,” Mr. Olson said in a statement issued by the agency last week. “While the requirements provide great benefits to companies and their investors, we are concerned that the costs are not adequately aligned with the benefits.”The resolution of the debate over Section 404 has broad political consequences. The two new Democratic chairmen of the House and Senate committees that oversee the markets—Representative Barney Frank of Massachusetts and Senator Christopher Dodd of Connecticut — have both said in recent days that they will be watching the situation closely.Some lawmakers have called for Congress to reopen the Sarbanes-Oxley law and water down what they see as its more onerous provisions. Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. has also said he believed that the regulators could resolve the complaints about Section 404 without any need for Congressional intervention.'"

Discouraging or disallowing efforts like those in Seattle and Louisville, Ky., threatens to send us backward, not forward.Taking voluntary options away is not the right remedy. The Supreme Court justices should not overturn the lower court rulings that upheld the two plans. They should let local residents decide. If they do not agree with what the school boards in their school districts propose, they should vote them out of office.In your defense of the use of race-based student assignments by the Seattle and Louisville, Ky., school systems, you call this approach “completely voluntary.”Well, it is voluntary in the sense that the school systems weren’t forced to engage in this discrimination (and neither were the school boards that embraced de jure segregation), but the schoolchildren here didn’t volunteer to be discriminated against.You then argue that the race-based system “is applied to students of all races” and “does not advantage or disadvantage any particular racial group.” But, of course, the same argument might have been made in defense of miscegenation statutes, which forbade blacks from marrying whites as well as whites from marrying blacks.You say that conservatives are being hypocritical in challenging local control here and advocating “judicial activism.” But judicial activism means making up constitutional rights that don’t exist.

Signs pointed to smiling prisoners freed at the end of the war with the label “truth.”New captions in Persian on other pictures of corpses described them as victims of a typhus epidemic in Europe, not of the Nazi death machine.Speakers at the conference praised Mr. Ahmadinejad’s comments about the Holocaust.Bendikt Frings, 48, a psychologist from Germany, said he believed that Mr. Ahmadinejad was “an honest, direct man.” He said he had come to the conference to thank the president for what he had initiated.“We are forbidden to have such a conference in Germany,” he said. “All my childhood, we waited for something like this.”Frederick Toben, from Australia, said Mr. Ahmadinejad had opened an issue “which is morally and intellectually crippling the Western society.”“People are imprisoned in Germany for denying the Holocaust,” he added. Mr. Toben said that he was jailed for six months in 1999 for his ideas and that there was a court order in Germany to arrest him if he again spoke against the Holocaust.Mr. Duke’s speech argued that inventions about what happened to Europe’s Jews were part of a plot. He said, “Depicting Jews as the overwhelming victims of the Holocaust gave the moral high ground to the Allies as victors of the war and allowed Jews to establish a state on the occupied land of Palestine.”There were also members of anti-Zionist ultra-Orthodox Jewish sects in attendance. One Jewish participant in a long black coat and hat wore a badge saying: “A Jew, not a Zionist.”A 2004 book by an American author, Michael Collins Piper, “The New Jerusalem: Zionist Power in America,” was on sale for $20.It was not clear how the speakers were assembled. The institute’s Web site invited scholars and researchers to submit their papers in advance. The Foreign Ministry provided little information about the participants, saying that it feared they would be prosecuted by their countries.The organizers said they planned for “both sides” to be heard, but none of the speeches collected in the ministry’s book or any of the exhibitions spoke of the reality of the Nazi killing. A CD with the stories of 12 Holocaust survivors was said to be available.The event has sparked outrage in the West.Germany summoned the Iranian chargé d’affaires to express its anger, and the French foreign minister, Philippe Douste-Blazy, has condemned the conference.Last summer, Iran created a contest for cartoons about the Holocaust in reaction to the controversy over Danish cartoons lampooning the Prophet Muhammad.The Iranian Jewish community reacted angrily to Mr. Ahmadinejad’s comments last year and said his words had spread fear among them.“We consider the Holocaust as a fact and a disgrace for humanity,” the head of the community, Haround Yashayai, said Monday.'"
"'06-12-12,'0','Stock options give their owner the right to buy stock for as long as 10 years at a price set when the options are granted. Google officials said they believed that employees typically underestimated their value.“It is very difficult for employees to understand what their options are worth,” said Dave Rolefson, Google’s equity and executive compensation manager, in an interview. “If they can see what others would pay for them, then option valuation would become simple for employees.”The new options, which will have lives of 10 years, will have the same vesting schedule as existing options, with some options vesting after 12 months and all vesting within four years. Once the options are vested, employees will be able to hold them, exercise them or sell them. They are likely to reap greater gains from selling than from exercising them.For example, an employee who holds a vested option permitting him to buy shares at a strike price of $460, assuming the stock is trading at $482, can currently exercise the option and pocket $22. The new transferable stock option could be worth a lot more than that, because of the expectation that the stock could rise further.Google said any options that are sold when their remaining life is greater than two years would immediately become two-year options. In those two years, the financial institution or investor buying them would not be able to sell the options in a secondary market, but would be able to use various financial instruments to hedge against fluctuations in Google’s stock price.The financial institution is likely to pay less than it would if the option life was not reduced, but much more than the employee would receive if he or she exercised the option and sold the stock.In trading today, an option to buy Google for $460 a share in January 2009, a little more than two years from now, sold for $123.50 in trading at the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, far more than the value that would have come from exercising it now. A financial institution that bought such an option now from an employee probably would pay a price below that level, but not too far below it.Even options with strike prices higher than the value of the company’s stock — so-called underwater options — would probably have some value in the market being created, and they could be sold by Google employees. Today, at the Chicago Board Options Exchange, a January 2009 option with a strike price of $520 sold for $99.80.For years, technology companies opposed efforts of accounting rule makers to force them to record as an expense the cost of options granted to employees. Since the rule went into effect last year, some have tried to change the terms of the options, or the assumptions made in valuing them, to reduce the reported expense. But Google’s change, because it will increase the expected life of the options, will raise the reported cost of each option.In the long run, however, Google’s reported profits could climb if it is able to offer fewer options to attract and retain employees.“We want to continue to use stock options, but we don’t want to be wasteful either,” Mr. Rolefson said. “We won’t need to use as many options to deliver the same value to employees.”Google is not the first company to offer employees the possibility of selling options, but it is the first to propose doing so regularly. In 2003, Microsoft arranged for J.P. Morgan to offer to purchase all options with exercise prices over $33 a share. Employees who took that offer have had no cause to regret it, because the share price has never risen to that level.Google said that its plan would be available to all employees other than the company’s most senior executives, who will continue to receive traditional options that can be exercised but not transferred. All stock options granted to employees since Google went public in 2004 will be converted into transferable options, resulting in a one-time accounting charge, the company said without disclosing how large the charge is expected to be. The plan is expected to go into effect in the second quarter of next year.Through September, Google had 6.6 million outstanding stock options that would be eligible for the plan. Dave Sobota, a Google lawyer, said the plan did not require the approval of the Securities and Exchange Commission.Nell Minow, editor of the Corporate Library, a research firm specializing in executive compensation and corporate governance, said Google had come up with an “elegant” solution to what she described as a “communications problem.”“It’s a very Google-esque solution, and it is a very ‘not evil’ solution,” Ms. Minow said, alluding to Google’s “Don’t be evil” corporate mantra. “I like that.”Still, Ms. Minow said she remained skeptical of stock options as an optimal way to motivate employees, not because employees lacked a full understanding of their value, but because they typically saw no direct link between their hard work as individuals and the company’s share price.“I’m skeptical it will be tremendously helpful to shareholders,” Ms. Minow said.Given Google’s prominent role in the technology industry and status as an innovator, some experts say that other companies are likely to emulate its new compensation plan.“I would be very surprised if the idea isn’t picked up by many more companies in a very short order,” said Joseph Grundfest, a professor of business and law at Stanford University, and co-director of the Arthur and Toni Rembe Rock Center for Corporate Governance. “If Google does it, it validates it as a smart idea.”But Ted Buyniski, a compensation consultant and senior vice president with Radford Surveys and Consulting, a subsidiary of the AON Corporation, cautioned that the problem Google faced was uncommon, as its high stock price sharpened the discrepancy between the financial and perceived value of its stock options. Employees tend to think that a $5 stock is more likely to go to $10, than a $500 stock is to go to $1,000, Mr. Buyniski said.“There is a perception among most employees that the higher a stock price is, the less likely it is to go up further, even though that’s not necessarily true,” he said. Because of that, “other companies don’t necessarily have that same gap between perceived value and actual value” as Google.Given the costs in putting a transferable stock option plan into effect, it is unlikely that many other companies will rush to follow Google, Mr. Buyniski said.It is not clear how Google’s plan will change employee behavior. Economists generally say that employees typically exercise their options too quickly. By exposing the time value of options, the plan may encourage employees to hold their options for longer periods, said Mr. Grundfest, a former member of the S.E.C.Or, he said, it could prompt employees to cash out more quickly.“If you simply assume that by giving people an additional choice, they will elect that choice only if it is to their benefit, then it is likely to be an improvement all the way around,” Mr. Grundfest said.But Ms. Minow said the plan could be detrimental if it encourages employees to sell their stock options more quickly.“I’d really like to see people hold on to their stock options and remain invested in their company, and not to think of them as a pipeline for cash exercise,” Ms. Minow said.'"
"'06-12-12,'0','Bankers and lawyers in London said that Nasdaq timed its official offer shrewdly, forcing the London exchange’s advisors to work through the Hanukkah and Christmas holidays to respond.Relations between the two exchanges are frosty. Executives from the London exchange have never agreed to negotiate with Nasdaq, and according to several people on each side, they have not even been in contact with their counterparts in New York since November, when Nasdaq announced its intention to make a formal bid at £12.43 a share.Complicating matters for Nasdaq, though, is the market speculation in London Stock Exchange stock, which is now trading well above the offer value. The share price hovered around £13.20 ($25.95) a share during the day today. Hedge funds, which hold an estimated 30 to 40 percent of the London exchange’s shares, have been adding to their holdings in recent weeks, anticipating a higher offer.But under British takeover law, Nasdaq cannot raise its offer now unless it gets a recommendation from the London Exchange’s board, which so far refuses to cooperate, or unless another potential buyer makes a bid. Most analysts think there are no other likely bidders.If too few shares are tendered to Nasdaq for it to reach a simple majority by the deadline, and if Nasdaq is unable to engage the London exchange’s board in discussions, it would then have to walk away, and not make another offer for a year.Several analysts in London said that it was unlikely that the situation would be resolved by the Jan. 11 deadline, or even by a Feb. 10 extension, since few shareholders are likely to tender their shares at a time when they can be sold for more in the open market.They suggested that Nasdaq may be playing a longer-term game, counting on the investors to bid the shares downward once the tender offer expires, making a new one next year easier to execute. Or it may be counting on pressure from fund managers who hold large blocks of shares to force the London exchange’s management to negotiate with Nasdaq.Many shareholders seem to be betting on a higher price.On Dec. 8, the United States investment companies Horizon Asset Management and Kinetics Asset Management said that the had accumulated 6.4 percent of the London exchange’s stock, paying as much as £13.14 ($25.83) a share, according to filings with the London Stock Exchange.Legal and General Asset Management, a London-based manager of £211 billion ($415 billion) in assets, said today that it holds 3.74 percent, paying up to £13.20 a share. State Street Global Advisors said today that it holds 1.9 percent and has paid £13.24 a share.'"

Lugovoi, the main witness in the poisoning case of Alexander V. Litvinenko. Mr. Lugovoi, who has been undergoing treatment for suspected radiation poisoning at a Moscow hospital, refused to speak in detail about his three-hour interrogation, though he emphasized that investigators considered him a witness, not a suspect. Mr. Lugovoi and his lawyer said that Dmitri V. Kovtun, another witness in the case, was in stable condition after suffering symptoms similar to those of Mr. Litvinenko before he died.GAZPROM TO CONTROL SAKHALIN 2: The Anglo-Dutch oil company, Shell, has offered to sell Russia’s Gazprom a controlling share of the Sakhalin 2 energy project. An unnamed source from Sakhalin Energy, the project’s operator, told the newspaper that Shell’s chief executive, Joroen van der Veer, made a proposal in a meeting on Friday with Gazprom’s Aleksei B, Miller to sell the state-owned company 30 percent of its shares in Sakhalin Energy. Mitsui and Co. and Mitsubishi may also sell 20 percent of their shares in the project. Some international experts have said the Russian government pressured the companies into making the concessions.RUSSIANS PREPARE FOR FINANCIAL DOOMSDAY: As of last summer, Russians had deposited about $220 billion in foreign banks, the most capital flight of any developing country, according to the Bank of International Settlements. Almost half of this sum is located in London and is in some way connected with Russia’s oil and gas sector. According to one Russian banker, Russia’s rich have sent their money abroad in expectation of a “black day,” perhaps soon after the presidential election in 2008, when Russia’s experiment with liberal economy will end.EXTREMISM IS THE PRESIDENT’S PRIORITY: President Vladimir V. Putin called on government ministers and members of his administration on Monday to introduce harsher penalties for hate crimes, just days after he met with political party leaders to discuss Russia’s extremism problem. He also ordered the Interior Ministry to develop closer relationships with ethnic diasporas in Russia. The newspaper wrote that extremism and nationalism, which has frightened voters as much as separatism and Russia’s disintegration once did, will be the main theme in the runup to elections in 2007 and 2008.SANCTIONS TO HAVE NO IMPACT ON BUSHEHR: Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei V. Lavrov, said on Monday that proposed sanctions against Iran by the European troika — Great Britain, France and Germany — would not negatively impact the construction of the Bushehr nuclear power plant. According to Mr. Lavrov, the sanctions would only restrict technology and materials that could be used in the development of nuclear weapons. A spokesman for Russia’s atomic energy agency, Rosatom, called the power plant the main focus of economic cooperation between Russia and Iran.HOLOCAUST CONFERENCE OPENS IN IRAN: A controversial Iranian conference entitled, “The Holocaust: A Global Approach,” opened on Monday in Tehran. Speaking before the opening of the gathering, a member of the Russian Academy of Sciences said that though he did not agree with the term Holocaust, there was no denying the genocide of the Jews during World War II. Viktor Nadein-Raevsky, Russia’s only representative at the conference, criticized Israel, however, for recognizing only Jews as victims, while ignoring the genocide of gypsies, Slavs and Armenians.'"

"'06-12-12,'0','The recognition that families associate price with quality, and that a tuition rise, accompanied by discounts, can lure more applicants and revenue, has helped produce an economy in academe something like that in the health care system, with prices rising faster than inflation but with many consumers paying less than full price.Average tuition at private, nonprofit four-year colleges — the price leaders — rose 81 percent from 1993 to 2004 , more than double the inflation rate, according to the College Board, while campus-based financial aid rose 135 percent.The average cost of tuition, fees, room and board at those colleges is now $30,367. Many charge much more; at George Washington University, the sum is more than $49,000.But aid is now so extensive that more than 73 percent of undergraduates attending private four-year institutions received it in the school year that ended in 2004, not even counting loans.“We can cushion the sticker shock,” said Amy Gutmann, president of the University of Pennsylvania, which distributes aid on the basis of financial need. “We focus on both middle-income and low-income families.”So net prices vary widely on a given campus. On some, as many as 90 percent of students receive support, primarily from the college itself or the federal government.And financial need is not the only basis for it. Many colleges, competing for the students with high grades and standardized test scores that help a college rise in rankings guides, offer merit aid ranging from a few thousand dollars to a full scholarship.But officials of private colleges and universities say they fear that unless other steps are taken, the middle and upper middle class could ultimately be squeezed out.“Eventually, if we’re going to keep raising tuition at rates much more than the increase in family incomes, then something has to be done to make the places more accessible to the middle class,” said Ronald G. Ehrenberg, director of the Cornell Higher Education Research Institute.As it is, some students may not even apply to private colleges, scared away from the start by tuition and unaware of the available discounts. After all, tuition and fees at public colleges and universities — though growing recently at a faster pace than those at private institutions — remain vastly lower, at an average of $5,836, the College Board says.It can be argued that everyone studying at a private liberal arts college is getting a discount. At institution after institution, officials say they offer an education costing tens of thousands of dollars more than even the college’s “sticker price.”Take Swarthmore, the elite college half an hour’s drive from Ursinus. With an annual budget of $106 million to educate just under 1,500 undergraduates, Swarthmore spends about $73,690 a student. But its tuition, room, board and fees in the last academic year were little more than $41,000.“The half of our student body whose families are paying the full sticker price are paying $41,000 for something that costs $73,000,” said Suzanne P. Welsh, the treasurer. “So they’re getting a great discount.”The other students receive a bigger subsidy: on average, aid totaling more than $28,500, most of it from the college itself. (Swarthmore limits its aid to students with financial need, but that can mean those from families earning $150,000 a year if, for instance, there are circumstances like having multiple children in college.)What makes it all work is Swarthmore’s $1.3 billion endowment, which throws off enough income to cover 43 percent of the operating budget.The biggest expenditure at liberal arts colleges is for salaries and benefits. With competition for big-name professors becoming more intense, faculty salaries have increased. So has the pay of college and university presidents, more than 100 of whom now receive at least $500,000 a year.Then there are the amenities sought by students: coffee bars, lavish new dormitories, state-of-the-art science laboratories and fitness centers.“You’re trying to create the best educational experience for your students, and that costs money,” said Tom Tritton, president of Haverford College. “I sometimes say to parents, ‘I can make it cheaper if you want.’ ”Still, none of this explains why colleges like Swarthmore and Ursinus — with different student-faculty ratios, endowments and reputations — end up with tuition and fees only a few hundred dollars apart, or less. Or why Harvard’s tuition and fees, at $33,709, are virtually the same as theirs.One big reason is that institutions of higher learning watch one another.In November, the finance committee of Swarthmore’s board of managers gathered at a Manhattan law firm and pored over a chart of tuition, room and board at more than 30 prestigious colleges and universities. They were pleased to see that Swarthmore was charging somewhat less than most of its competitors.That kind of scrutiny led Bryn Mawr to a contrary sentiment, causing the college to raise tuition and fees this year by about 9 percent, their biggest jump in several years. Bryn Mawr officials say they made the decision after their research showed that the college charged less than its rivals and awarded more aid. The officials concluded that raising tuition would not deter applicants, because prospective students already assumed that Bryn Mawr cost the same as comparable colleges.“The question was, Does that make sense?” said John Griffith, Bryn Mawr’s treasurer and chief financial officer. “Have we benefited at all from being the low price point? And the answer was no.”Some of the nation’s bigger institutions have also found an incentive to raise prices. As part of an effort to improve its academic offerings and transcend its renown for football, the University of Notre Dame has raised tuition and fees by an inflation-adjusted 27 percent since 1999, to $32,900. In setting tuition, Notre Dame watches 20 other colleges and universities, including the University of Chicago, Emory and Vanderbilt.“We’re setting it by our competitors,” said the Rev. John I. Jenkins, the institution’s president.But Notre Dame’s financial aid has increased even more over the same period, with undergraduate scholarships up 107 percent after adjustment for inflation. This year the university is distributing $68 million.Facing stiff competition, Hendrix College, a small liberal arts institution in Conway, Ark., decided two years ago to bolster its academic offerings, promising students at least three hands-on experiences outside the classroom, including research, internships and service projects. It also raised tuition and fees 29 percent, to $21,636. Most of the increase went back to students as aid.As a result, 409 students enrolled in the freshman class this year, a 37 percent increase.“What worked was the buzz,” said J. Timothy Cloyd, the Hendrix president. “Students saw that they were going to get an experience that had value, and the price positioning conveyed to them the value of the experience.”Other colleges have tried the opposite. Muskingum College in New Concord, Ohio, cut tuition and fees drastically in 1996, to $10,285 from $14,240.“We believed that if we lowered tuition, we would open access to the middle class” and “that we would continue to serve the higher socioeconomic-background students by becoming a best-buy institution,” said Anne C. Steele, Muskingum’s president.Revenue increased, with enrollment of more students who could pay full price. Muskingum has also grown, to 1,600 undergraduates from about 1,000.Yet the same strategy proved disastrous for North Carolina Wesleyan College. Ten years ago that college cut tuition and fees by 22 percent, to $7,150. But it attracted fewer wealthy applicants and more poor ones, who needed more aid even as the revenue generated from tuition declined.“It didn’t work out the way it had been hoped,” said Ian David Campbell Newbould, the college’s president. “People don’t want cheap.”But they do apparently want a deal, or at least the perception of one. Lucie Lapovsky, a consultant who was once president of Mercy College in New York, conducted a study asking students to choose between a college charging $20,000 and offering no aid, and one charging $30,000 and offering a $10,000 scholarship. Students chose the pricier option.“Americans seem to like college on sale,” Dr. Lapovsky said.Many administrators say that without raising prices, they could not maintain or expand economic diversity among the student body. In other words, making college more expensive for some enables less well off students to go.But Brian Zucker, president of the Human Capital Research Corporation, a consulting firm that works with colleges, is suspicious of that argument, particularly given the growth of merit aid. He points out that many middle-class students borrow tens of thousands of dollars to attend liberal arts colleges and that at some, they may be helping defray the cost of a merit scholarship to a wealthier applicant.“It’s not a given that the subsidy is going in any predetermined direction,” Mr. Zucker said. “We don’t know.”TOMORROW: Students, recent graduates, college presidents and others talk about whether they think a private college education is worth its cost.'"
"'06-12-12,'0','The N.C.A.A. president, Myles Brand, said in an interview yesterday that he had read the Times article but could not comment on specifics. He did applaud Auburn for conducting an internal audit, then added: “The second point is that academic fraud is, if not the worst, one of the worst offenses that an institution can commit. I mean that as a general comment. I won’t comment on any particular institution.”Keeter said that the audit was expected to reach the Auburn president, Edward R. Richardson, this week. The audit will include recommendations from the university provost. Keeter said that Richardson would not comment until he read the report, but Keeter said he expected “substantial news” to come out of the report.Keeter also stressed that there were now systems in place at the university to prevent a student-athlete from taking four classes that do not require attendance. The student’s three other A’s that semester were in courses taught by Professor Thomas Petee in a directed-readings format, a one-on-one learning style similar to independent study.After revelations in The Times in July that Petee taught up to 152 of these one-on-one courses in a semester, Auburn overhauled its directed-readings policies. Petee and another department head resigned their positions in the wake of the article.The question now is who changed the grade and how a student whom the professor, Paul Starr, could never recall meeting could receive an A in one of his courses.The report that Auburn has already forwarded to the N.C.A.A. reveals that Petee changed 55 grades from January 2003 to the spring of 2006, more than double the amount of the average faculty member in the sociology department. Although much of the information in the report is divided between athletes and nonathletes, the report does not reveal what percentage of grades changed belonged to athletes.“I’m certain that there is an explanation for that from those that put that report together,” Keeter said. “I will have to get in touch with them to have that answer.”Vanderbilt’s chancellor, Gordon Gee, said Auburn was another example of the problems caused when athletic departments are run separately from the university.“I applaud them for having fixed the problems,” said Gee, who has dissolved the traditional structure of the athletic department at Vanderbilt and blended it with the rest of the university. “I also think the discussion needs to continue, why that culture existed and what we as universities have to do to prevent that culture. That’s not just an Auburn problem. That becomes a lot of problems for a lot of us.”'"
"'06-12-12,'0','In October, Ghassan Elashi, a founder and former chairman of the charity, was sentenced to more than six years in prison after he and four brothers were convicted of violating export laws by shipping computers to Syria and Libya, both once on the United States list of terrorism sponsors. Libya was removed this year.Last year, Mr. Elashi and two brothers were convicted of helping a Hamas leader launder money.The Treasury Department’s repeated refusal to unfreeze charities’ assets so they can be sent abroad has provoked alarm and frustration in the philanthropic world.“The question is not whether the individual nonprofits are guilty as organizations,” said Kay Guinane of OMB Watch, a Washington group advocating government transparency.“The issue is whether there is a fair process to determine that and how to protect the charitable dollars so they are used for the intended purposes,” Ms. Guinane said. “What Treasury has done is treat charities the same way they treat the criminal process. It has really hurt the U.S. image in the places where the aid was expected and where people were depending on it.”Early last month, philanthropic groups from across the nation sent Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulsen Jr. a letter asking that he find a way to release the assets to their intended recipients. Mr. Paulsen has not responded, Ms. Guinane said.A spokeswoman for the department, Molly Millerwise, said courts, citing national security, had repeatedly upheld the government’s use of secret evidence to freeze assets of charitable organizations.“These institutions have been designated because they are financing terrorism,” Ms. Millerwise said. “We have to make sure that the money is kept in place and does not go to illicit ends.”Critics say the law prevents the airing of secret evidence in such cases. “When Treasury says the courts have upheld its action, they are saying the courts found its action was not arbitrary and capricious,” Ms. Guinane said. “Not that the court made any kind of independent determination of the merits or factual accuracy.”A spokesman for the Justice Department, Bryan Sierra, said he could not comment on the Holy Land motion because it was too new. As a matter of procedure, Mr. Sierra said, prosecution does not automatically follow the designation of a charity as a terrorist organization.“Not every case is a criminal case,” he said. “It’s a question of can you come up with enough evidence to prosecute based on a violation of the statutes of material support for terrorism.”Charitable giving is one of the five pillars of Islam, and the closing of Muslim charities has become a major source of American Muslims’ distrust of the federal government.Many American Muslims accuse the government of, at best, acting out of fear and ignorance to tamp contributions. At worst, they say the Bush administration focuses on Arab and Muslim groups critical of United States policy in the Middle East, particularly charities that aid poor Palestinians in the territories occupied by Israel.“That was a valve that does not put the Palestinian population under pressure,” Hatem Bazian, a professor of Near Eastern studies at the University of California, Berkeley, said. “If you starve them, they will take the deal the least acceptable to them.”The government says just Muslim charities have been designated because they are the ones that terrorist groups have penetrated.“The sad truth is that we have seen groups like Hamas and Al Qaeda infiltrate the charitable community, and specifically the Arab and Muslim charitable community,” Ms. Millerwise said. “When we do find evidence that any group is providing material or financial support, we have a responsibility to act against them and designate them and put the world on notice that this group is facilitating terrorists.”Holy Land was once the largest American Muslim charity, receiving more than $57 million in contributions, gifts and grants from 1992 to 2001, the indictment says. It seeks to have more than half the charges in the 42-count indictment dismissed, based on the ruling last month by Judge Audrey B. Collins in Federal District Court in Los Angeles.Judge Collins said an executive order used to identify organizations and individuals as “specially designated global terrorists” violated the Constitution because it was too vague. Other districts are not bound by the ruling. Congress has largely ignored the question.Lawyers for two other charities said they expected to file similar motions. Lawyers for two others said they were defunct, left bankrupt by challenging terrorism designations.American Muslim organizations acknowledge that Islamic charities overseas funneled money and arms to support Al Qaeda and other terrorist groups. But they say guilt by association rather than hard evidence has become a judicial standard for them in the United States.“The government’s claim of national security is a way to conceal government misconduct rather than state secrets,” said Matthew J. Piers, the lawyer for the Benevolence International Foundation, a defunct charity that had been in Illinois.Charity officials say the United States is shooting itself in the foot. Rather than spending millions on failed advertising to improve its image, the officials say, Washington should let the charities work where it is not welcome.“People are saying that this is not about this or that charity, it’s about Islam,” said Khalil Jassemm, who helped found Life for Relief and Development, a charity in Michigan. “We could be a humanitarian bridge to the Muslim world, but nobody thinks about that.”'"

"'06-12-12,'0','Among the series to be introduced in the coming months are “El Tigre: The Adventures of Manny Rivera,” a cartoon about a Latino family of superheroes and supervillains, created by a Mexican husband-and-wife team; “Ni Hao, Kai-lan,” a series for preschoolers created by a first-generation Chinese-American; and “Tak and the Power of Juju,” based on a video game set in the fantasy world of the Pupanunu people. Also in development is an animated series based on characters from the feature film “Barnyard,” and “Mighty B,” a cartoon about a sweet, merit-badge-obsessed girl scout created by Amy Poehler, of “Saturday Night Live.”In the last two years the Disney Channel has been eating into Nickelodeon’s long-standing spot as the top-ranked cable network among children, rapidly gaining viewers while Nickelodeon’s ratings have been edging up, but only slightly. But the Disney Channel has made a specialty out of scripted, live-action series. Nickelodeon makes that type of series too, but cartoons are the engine that powers the bus.“Animation really is the heart and soul of our business,” Ms. Zarghami said. It accounts, she said, for more than 70 percent of annual revenues from advertising and licensing of consumer products. (Viacom, Nickelodeon’s parent, does not break out individual company revenues.)The raft of new animation coming to Nickelodeon in 2007, Ms. Zarghami said, is not a direct result of the rising competition from the Disney Channel and others.“Our business is cyclical,” she said. “Some years we have more new live action, some years more animation and some years more new shows for preschoolers.” And while Nickelodeon intends to continue producing all of those genres, “animation will remain at the center,” she said. “That is the stuff that plays around the world, it plays on broadband channels as well as television, and it translates into toys.”Lots of them, in fact. Both “SpongeBob” and “Dora the Explorer,” the animated bilingual show for preschoolers, have generated more than $1 billion in revenues from advertising and licensing of consumer products since their debuts in 1999 (“SpongeBob”) and 2000 (“Dora”).If things go according to plan, children could be dressing up next Halloween as “El Tigre,” a well-meaning 13-year-old who is alternately drawn to emulating the good deeds of his father, the semi-retired superhero White Pantera, and the evil acts of his grandfather, the famed super-villain Puma Loco.Though the series is by and about Latinos, “we think all of the stuff that happens to Manny could happen to kids in any culture,” said Sandra Equihua, who created the series with her husband, Jorge Gutierrez.“El Tigre” explores arenas of Latino culture that are not touched upon by “Dora.” The White Pantera wears a Mexican wrestling mask, for example, and the villains are often characters drawn from Mexican folklore, like Día de los Muertos, or Day of the Dead, a holiday that honors and celebrates loved ones who have died.The Rivera family lives in crime-plagued Miracle City, which Mr. Gutierrez said was “a combination of Los Angeles, New York, Mexico City and Rio.” Puma Loco, the grandfather, wears a sombrero, other villains wear bandoleers, and all the characters speak with a heavy Spanish accent.“Why not?” said Mr. Gutierrez, who was born in Mexico City and lived in Tijuana, before attending college at the California Institute of the Arts in Valencia, Calif. “I have an accent that I can’t get rid of.”The hope of course is that “El Tigre” will appeal not only to the rapidly expanding Hispanic audience but to children from all backgrounds. And that fans of the show will be inclined to purchase merchandise.As difficult as it is to predict whether a show will be a hit, it is more difficult to anticipate the demand for related consumer goods. Ms. Zarghami noted that “The Fairly OddParents,” about a boy with two shape-shifting fairy godparents who get him out of trouble (after sometimes helping him get into it), and “Hey Arnold!,” about a city-savvy fourth-grader, “were some of the highest rated animated shows for years, but we couldn’t sell a T-shirt” with any of those characters on it.A show’s survival is not dependent on those extra revenues. And Ms. Zarghami’s point about the unusually long life of some animated series is particularly relevant in the case of “SpongeBob.” It will surpass 100 episodes late next year. While that milestone is not as important as it is for sitcoms, which need their episodes to number in the triple digits to allow for daily syndication, it nevertheless testifies to its importance as a franchise.“One of the great things about animation is that you can play it over and over again, and kids will still watch it,” Ms. Zarghami said. “With live action they won’t.”Witness the results from the network’s recent 24-hour “SpongeBob” marathon, capped by a single new episode and the first television broadcast of “The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie” (2004). Those “SpongeBob” episodes accounted for 25 of the 40 highest-rated shows on cable for the week, each drawing from 3.3 million to 6.6 million viewers, according to Nielsen Media Research. Not surprisingly, Nickelodeon has recently signed up “SpongeBob” for a sixth season. (The show was on hiatus for more than a year during the production of the movie.)Nickelodeon also added to its original orders for three series before they even reached the air. “El Tigre,” “Tak” and “Mighty B” each have had their contracts extended to 20 episodes from 13.Ms. Zarghami cites Nickelodeon’s willingness to invest in shows for the long term as something that sets it apart from rivals. As an example, she points to “Avatar: The Last Airbender,” an anime-inspired cartoon that took six years to go from idea to a completed first episode, much longer than normal. Last season it was the eighth-highest rated animated children’s series, according to Nielsen.Similarly “Ni Hao, Kai-lan,” which among its bolder tasks will attempt to teach kids elements of basic Mandarin, has been in development for three years.“Kids have an appetite for the new,” Ms. Zarghami said, explaining the importance of developing series. “They don’t want to just see the old stuff if they can see new stuff.”'"
"'06-12-12,'0','New studies project that the Arctic Ocean could be mostly open water in summer by 2040 — several decades earlier than previously expected — partly as a result of global warming caused by emissions of greenhouse gases.The projections come from computer simulations of climate and ice and from direct measurements showing that the amount of ice coverage has been declining for 30 years.The latest modeling study, being published on Tuesday in the journal Geophysical Research Letters, was led by Marika Holland of the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo.The study involved seven fresh simulations on supercomputers at the atmospheric center, as well as an analysis of simulations developed by independent groups. In simulations where emissions continue to rise, sea ice persists for long periods but then abruptly gives way to open water, Dr. Holland said.In the simulations, the shift seems to occur when a pulse of warm Atlantic Ocean water combines with the thinning and retreat of ice under the influence of the global warming trend. Scientists ascribe most of that planet-scale warming, including a warming of the shallow layers of the oceans, to the buildup of carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping smokestack and tailpipe gases in the atmosphere.'"
"'06-12-12,'0','Typically, a girl like Kahan would be imprisoned in a trafficker’s house, tied up and beaten if she resisted, inspected by a doctor to certify her virginity, and sold for hundreds of dollars to a Cambodian or Thai businessman. Virgins are in particular demand by men with AIDS because of a legend that they can be cured by having sex with a virgin.Afterward, Kahan would have been locked up in a brothel in Pailin, and sold for $10 a session for the first couple of months. The price eventually would drop to $1.50, and by then she would be given greater freedom.By being rescued, Kahan was spared all that — but she had suffered an overdose of the drugs. “Kahan seemed like a dead person,” said her mother, Sang Kha. “Her eyes were rolling, she was drooling.”Even weeks later, Kahan’s face remained partially paralyzed, she could not speak, and she was weak and sickly. Desperate to get medical treatment, Ms. Sang Kha borrowed $200 from usurious money lenders charging 20 percent per month, and the girl’s uncle mortgaged his home to help pay for treatment.But the family is now broke and heavily indebted, and Kahan still can only mumble. “I’m still very weak,” was all I could coax out of her.The police had released Ms. Khort Chan after two days, and I was unable to track her down. But neighbors at two of her former houses said she had fled after apparently trafficking her own sister.Some of the neighbors added a layer of complexity to her story: They believe that Ms. Khort Chan herself had been sold to a brothel as a young woman. She escaped or worked her way out, and then became a slave trader herself.And slavery is what this is. The real problem isn’t prostitution or trafficking, it’s the enslavement of people.The Lancet, the British medical journal, once estimated that 10 million children 17 and under may work in prostitution worldwide. Not all are coerced, but in the nastier brothels of Cambodia, Nepal, India, Malaysia and Thailand, the main difference from 19th-century slavery is that the victims are mostly dead of AIDS by their 20’s.“It seems almost certain that the modern global slave trade is larger in absolute terms than the Atlantic slave trade in the 18th and 19th centuries was,” notes an important article about trafficking in the current issue of Foreign Affairs. It adds, “Just as the British government (after much prodding by its subjects) once used the Royal Navy to stamp out the problem, today’s great powers must bring their economic and military might to bear on this most crucial of undertakings.”President Bush has done a much better job than his predecessors in pressing this issue; his State Department office on trafficking is one of his few diplomatic successes. And the issue enjoys bipartisan support, with leadership coming from conservative Republicans like Senator Sam Brownback and liberal Democrats like Representative Carolyn Maloney.So President Bush, how about using your last two years to make this issue an international priority? A nudge in your State of the Union address could jump-start a new Abolitionist movement, so as to free children now dying slowly from rape and AIDS because they did something as simple as accepting ice cream from a neighbor.'"

"'06-12-13,'1','Sex education messages to young men need to make it clear that “this does not mean that you have an absolute protection,” said Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, an AIDS researcher and director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, which sponsored the trials. Circumcision should be added to other prevention methods, not replace them, he said.The two trials were carried out among nearly 3,000 men in Kisumu, Kenya, and nearly 5,000 men in Rakai, Uganda. None were infected with H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS; they were divided into circumcised and uncircumcised groups. They were given safe sex advice — although many presumably did not take it — and retested regularly.The trials were stopped by the National Institutes of Health’s Data Safety and Monitoring Board this week after data showed that the Kenyan men had a 53 percent reduction in new H.I.V. cases and the Ugandan men a 48 percent reduction.In Kenya, 22 of the 1,393 circumcised young men in the study caught the disease, compared with 47 of the 1,391 uncircumcised men.Those results echo the finding of a trial completed last year in the town of Orange Farm, South Africa, financed by the French government, which demonstrated a reduction of 60 percent among circumcised men.Two agencies, one under the State Department and the other financed by a number of countries, said they now would be willing to pay for circumcisions, which they have not before, citing a lack of hard evidence that it works.Dr. Richard G. A. Feachem, executive director of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, said that if a country seeking money submitted plans to conduct safe, sterile circumcisions, “I think it’s very likely that our technical panel would approve it.”Ambassador Mark Dybul, executive director of the $15 billion President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief in the State Department, said his agency “will support implementation of safe medical male circumcision for HIV/AIDS prevention.”He too warned that it was only one new weapon.“Prevention efforts must reinforce the ABC approach — abstain, be faithful and correct and consistent use of condoms,” he said.Uncircumcised men are thought to be more susceptible to AIDS because the underside of the foreskin is rich in Langerhans’ cells, which attach easily to the virus. The foreskin may also suffer small tears during intercourse, making it more susceptible to infection.Researchers have long noted that parts of Africa where circumcision is practiced — particularly in the Muslim countries of West Africa — had much lower AIDS rates. But it was unclear whether other factors, such as religion or polygamy, played important roles.Outside Muslim regions, circumcision is spotty. In South Africa, for example, the Xhosa people circumcise teen-age boys, while Zulus, whose traditional homeland abuts theirs, do not. AIDS is common in members of both tribes.In recent years, as word has spread that circumcision might be protective, many African men have sought it out. A Zambian hospital offered $3 circumcisions last year, and Swaziland trained 60 doctors to give them at $40 each after its waiting lists grew.“Private practitioners also do it,” Dr. Halperin said. “In some places, it’s $20, in others, much more. Lots of the wealthy elite have already done it. It prevents STD’s, it’s seen as cleaner, sex is better, women like it. I predict that a lot of men who can’t afford private clinics will start clamoring for it.”'"
"'06-12-13,'1','BEIJING, Dec. 13 — An outspoken Chinese human rights lawyer was put on trial this week on charges of inciting subversion, but the authorities kept such tight control over the proceedings that his lawyer and his family were not given a chance to attend, his lawyer said today.Gao Zhisheng, the human rights lawyer, was tried Tuesday at Beijing’s No. 1 People’s Intermediate Court. The proceeding lasted less than a day and was conducted in open court, but Mr. Gao’s family and their chosen lawyer, Mo Shaoping, were never notified. No verdict has been announced.“This hearing did not follow the proper legal procedures,” Mr. Mo said. “They didn’t even inform the family.”Mr. Gao’s trial comes after two other controversial verdicts were announced earlier this month in different Chinese courts. In Shandong Province in eastern China, a court reinstated a guilty verdict for destroying property and disrupting traffic against Chen Guangcheng, a blind legal expert who had spoken out against local abuses of population control policies. His lawyers complained that local officials had blocked principal defense witnesses from attending the trial.In Beijing, an appeals court upheld a fraud conviction against Zhao Yan, a Chinese researcher for The New York Times, despite complaints from his defense team that they were prevented from presenting evidence and questioning witnesses. Mr. Zhao is serving a three-year sentence and is scheduled for release next September.Chinese lawyers have faced tighter scrutiny this year under new regulations that require attorneys to submit to government supervision when they represent clients in politically charged cases such as disputes over land seizures, forced evictions and pollution. A recent Human Rights Watch report warned that such regulations undermined the fairness of China’s legal system.'"
"'06-12-13,'1','The General Electric Company raised its quarterly dividend yesterday to 28 cents a share from 25 cents, in a move aimed at adding bolstering its lackluster share price.The increase, which is payable on Jan. 25, raises the G.E.’s dividend to $1.12 from $1.The announcement was just one of many that Jeffrey R. Immelt, G.E.’s chairman and chief executive, made during a two-hour presentation to analysts yesterday. Mr. Immelt also said that G.E. would earn $1.97 to $1.99 a share in 2006, in line with analyst estimates. And he promised a solid, low-risk 2007 in which we will invest capital back into the company.Specifically, Mr. Immelt predicted that G.E. would grow two to three times gross domestic product, and would probably have revenue of $175 billion next year. He also predicted that earnings from continuing operations to come in at $2.17 to $2.23 a share. Although that is slightly less than the $2.24 a share that analysts have been expecting, shareholders did not seem alarmed. G.E. shares closed at $35.64, up 42 cents.There are still problems, Mr. Immelt conceded. G.E.’s plastics business is still being hurt by higher costs for benzene and other raw materials, and flat prices for its products. While Mr. Immelt reaffirmed his support in NBC Universal and again squelched persistent suggestions that the unit might be for sale, he conceded that the business is still in a turnaround mode.But Mr. Immelt predicted particularly robust growth in sales in Europe and emerging markets, where G.E. has been gaining market share for its turbines, financial services and locomotives, and where it expects to have particularly robust sales of health care equipment. Orders remain solid, led by our major equipment segment, he said, and margins will also be bigger than expected.'"

"'06-12-13,'1','These congestion charges would raise electricity prices by about a nickel on the dollar if they were spread evenly, but in fact some customers pay far more and others pay nothing.Sometimes there is disagreement on how to measure congestion charges. The Energy Department estimates these charges for New York residents in the New York City area at almost $90 each last year, while the operators of the electricity network for the state say the cost was about $8. The extra charges could continue for years, because building new transmission lines can take at least a decade.The congested transmission network has frustrated the many who supported the opening of the electricity industry to competition a decade ago, hoping that prices would fall. Under the old system, regulated monopolies made and delivered power in their own area, with only small sales outside. The new system is intended to encourage a competitive business in which power is distributed over vast regional networks.But for electric prices to fall, the network must be able to move power from the lowest-cost plants to where it is needed, utility industry experts said.“Fully competitive markets and the tremendous added value that could be provided to customers have been stalled” by a transmission network that is too small and was not designed for competitive markets, three executives of National Grid, an electricity distribution company, wrote last year in The Electricity Journal.The North American Electric Reliability Council, which works to improve the network, echoed the comments of many industry leaders in declaring that “a robust, reliable transmission system is needed to develop a competitive market” that can save customers money.Investment in the network has been falling for three decades. For each dollar spent on the network in the 1970s, spending, adjusted for inflation, is only 75 cents today. Independent power producers say transmission would attract more investment if profits were not regulated, while municipal power agencies and other critics of making electricity a competitive business assert that inadequate investment in new lines is inevitable because it increases profits for power plant owners.The Energy Policy Act signed by President Bush last year seeks to speed construction of transmission lines by preventing state and local officials from blocking lines, or even influencing where they are built.A federal proposal to invoke these restrictions for a proposed high-voltage line through the Allegheny Mountains in Virginia has generated hundreds of complaints. Business owners, local officials and refugees from big cities said it would be irresponsible to mar their mountain vistas and small towns with a row of 17-story steel skeletons supporting the lines.Protests are also expected against proposed transmission lines from two nuclear plants in Arizona to Southern California and against a 1,000-mile line that Arizona Public Service plans so it would be able to cool Phoenix with electricity from wind farms and coal-fired plants in Wyoming.Most transmission lines are owned by utilities, but operational control has been turned over to independent organizations from Maine south to Virginia and west to the Dakotas and Texas, plus California. In other areas, utilities control the lines, and independent power producers have complained that the utilities favor their own plants even if their electricity is more expensive.When congestion charges force electric customers to pay more, many owners of power plants profit. They do so because, in many states, every power plant gets the same price as the highest bid accepted from any plant chosen to supply power. As utilities turn to less efficient, more expensive plants, the price paid to every other electricity producer rises.The high-cost plants that must be fired up when there is a bottleneck operate for more hours than they would if the network were designed for the competitive market. In some cases, expensive plants built just to meet peak demand, as on hot summer days, now run 40 percent of the year, Energy Department reports show.Most of these plants generate electricity from modified jet engines that burn natural gas, which is more expensive than electricity from coal or nuclear plants. But congestion has become so chronic that some century-old and very inefficient steam turbines must also be operated to avoid blackouts.Another important sign of worsening congestion is a sharp increase in requests by network operators to prevent overloads that could disrupt transmission on the PJM Interconnection, the network serving 51 million people from New Jersey to Illinois. There were 2,397 such requests last year, up from just 50 in 2004.Most electric customers have no way of knowing how much their bills have risen because of this problem. While the big industrial customers get detailed price information, smaller customers are largely in the dark. Congestion charges generally are not broken out as a separate item on their bills.Indeed, hardly anyone here even knows that electric bills have soared, because the borough government has so far covered the costs from a reserve fund, now almost empty.The average household in Chambersburg pays $78 a month for electricity.Audrey A. Zibelman, chief operating officer of the PJM electricity network, to which Chambersburg belongs, said the town’s congestion charges should end in 2008 when Allegheny Power completes an upgrade of a transformer station that serves Chambersburg.Just who pays more for congestion and who does not has become a burning question in places like Chambersburg. The method the networks use to determine prices for each customer is so complicated that hardly anyone understands it.Indeed, the town spent about $1 million this year just on lawyers and consultants to try to ensure that it got a fair deal.“The more rules, the more complicated it gets, the more we have to make sure we aren’t missing something in the overwhelming amount of documents from PJM that costs us a lot of money,” said Richard E. Hamsher, the electricity superintendent for Chambersburg.The town and other municipal utilities joined the PJM network, which serves 13 states, early in this decade. They complained about the congestion charges to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, arguing that they had contracted for access to power and that their own demands for power had not grown much.PJM said the problem arose because of its expansion to more Midwestern states. Charges in the newly expanded network were allocated in a different way, hurting towns like Chambersburg.Ms. Zibelman of the PJM network said the Chambersburg complaint was based on the faulty assumption that what the town pays should be based only on prices from the power plant in West Virginia from which it buys power. “You are not using a piece of the system, you are using the entire system,” she said, sharing in both its savings and its costs.The commission dismissed the complaint on Nov. 22. It decided that PJM had applied the rules properly but also said the distribution network should discuss with its members whether to revise its rules.Mr. Hamsher is not pleased. “Our customers lose,” he said, “and the people east of here who buy electricity got the benefit at our expense.”'"
"'06-12-13,'1','Now institutions like the Guggenheim, the Whitney Museum and Lincoln Center are making a push for the newest money on the block as they try to lure hedge fund executives to join their boards. This effort has dovetailed with an emerging tendency by hedge fund moguls to spread their wings a bit in greater New York society.“A lot of these guys when they get their wealth and power, they want something to go along with that,” said David Patrick Columbia, who has occasionally featured photographs of Mr. Ganek and his wife, Danielle, on his Web site, New York Social Diary. “Some collect art, some want to be philanthropists and once they get into the swim they find themselves being wined and dined by a variety of people. This experience gives them an affirmation of their social magnitude and that is an alluring thing for someone who makes a billion dollars.” The bait has always been simple: It is one thing to be rich and have world-class art on your walls, but it may not match the frisson that comes with having your name attached to a wing, rotunda or atrium. So, Mr. Kravis joined the board at the Metropolitan Museum of Art and got his wing; Mr. Perelman cast his lot with the Guggenheim and endowed a rotunda. More recently, Donald B. Marron, the former chief executive of PaineWebber and past president of the Museum of Modern Art board, had an atrium named after him and his wife.Now with top hedge fund executives expected to receive annual bonuses that should exceed $1 billion this year — by comparison, the best- paid Wall Street chief executive may get $50 million — they have become even more lucrative game.So far, the most aggressive institution has been Lincoln Center, which for the third year this April will hold a gala dinner supported by those in the hedge fund industry.The board has also relied on the reputation of one of its trustees and biggest donors, Bruce Kovner of Caxton Associates, to make its case to the next generation of hedge fund managers. A few weeks ago, Mr. Kovner presided over a breakfast at his office with David M. Rubenstein of the Carlyle Group. In attendance were Eric Mindich of Eton Park, Daniel H. Stern of Reservoir Capital, Glenn R. Dubin of Highbridge Capital, Steven T. Mnuchin of Dune Capital and Marc Lasry of Avenue Capital. Both Mr. Mnuchin, a neighbor of Mr. Ganek’s at 740 Park, and Mr. Mindich are on the Whitney board.Given the billions of dollars that hedge fund executives have spent on art — Steven A. Cohen of SAC Capital has invested well over $500 million himself — there have been only a few defining contributions made so far. Kenneth C. Griffin, 38, the founder of Citadel, has donated $19 million to the Art Institute of Chicago’s new modern wing, which will be called the Kenneth and Ann Griffin Court. And Mr. Kovner, whose interests veer more toward music manuscripts, has given $20 million for Lincoln Center’s new campus.While Mr. Cohen has joined the Modern’s painting and sculpture committee and Mr. Ganek sits on the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s photographs committee, no hedge fund executives sit on their main boards, nor those of New York’s other old-guard institutions like the New York Public Library or the Frick Collection. Experts say this may be a reflection of how recent the hedge fund fortunes are as well as the fact that for some their wealth allows them to create their own private museums.“I can’t imagine that Steve Cohen would want to go to a board meeting at the Met or MoMA if he can spend over $100 million on a De Kooning,” said Michael M. Thomas, a former partner at Lehman Brothers and a close follower of the art world. And the boards of the city’s major institutions, may be reluctant to embrace too quickly this era’s titans.The Whitney’s courtship of L. Dennis Kozlowski, the former chief executive of Tyco, in 2001, before he was indicted on charges that included skirting sales taxes on his art acquisitions, remains a cautionary tale.For the Guggenheim, it is Mr. Ganek’s 20-year interest in collecting modern art that makes him an ideal catch. “David has a real passion for this,” said Ms. Dennison, who has made it a priority to recruit younger financial executives to her board.The son of a money manager, Mr. Ganek grew up in New York City. He is a former protégé of Mr. Cohen and left SAC Capital in 2003 to set up his new fund, Level Global Investors. By the standards of today’s giant funds, his new $2.4 billion offering, which is up from $550 million at its inception, is by no means big. Nor has it been an extraordinary performer this year: Mr. Ganek’s fondness for betting that stocks will go down by selling them short has hampered his returns: he is up 9 percent through the first week of December, compared with a total return of nearly 15 percent with dividends reinvested for the Standard & Poor’s 500.People who know Mr. Ganek say he prefers a low profile and he would not comment for this article on his increasing involvement in the arts.Still, he is by no means shy: unlike other art moguls who prefer to phone their bids in, Mr. Ganek is a frequent presence at the major art auctions. He also likes to entertain; this summer he and his wife played host to 700 people for a charity benefit at their beach home in Southampton.His profile is likely to increase after the publication of his wife’s book next June, “Lulu Meets God and Doubts Him,” which Viking is promoting as “The Devil Wears Prada” for the art world.It may be early for Mr. Ganek to get his own wing, but with his small fund and his larger cultural ambitions he has already found himself a seat at the grand and growing table of New York society.“What gets you in is when other people want your money,” Mr. Thomas said. “It’s been like that for years. He is having fun with his money, and why not.”'"

Roberts Jr. said Tuesday that they could need another two months to finish the job.Mr. Roberts suggested that Mr. Corzine had delayed the process by diving late last week into one of the most contentious issues: pension and health benefits.“There clearly was some confusion,” Mr. Roberts told reporters during a conference of the New Jersey Business and Industry Association here. “There clearly was some miscommunication, and that resulted in frustration on the part of members of the Legislature.”With an average annual bill of $6,000 per household, New Jersey has the dubious distinction of having the highest property taxes in the country. With polls showing that property tax ranks as the biggest concern of residents — and with all 120 legislators facing re-election in Nov. 2007 — officials have felt a gnawing sense of urgency to do something substantial, and to do it soon.In July, Mr. Corzine demanded that the Legislature present him with a package of proposals to provide long-term relief by Jan. 1. In special sessions since then, lawmakers have wrestled with how to encourage local governments to share more resources, revamp the state’s formula for financing education and overhaul pension benefits.'"
"'06-12-13,'1','“When these guys learn what their bonuses are, we are among the first people they call,” said Pamela Liebman, the chief executive of the Corcoran Group, a residential brokerage. “They call their mothers, and then their real estate brokers.”Investment banking earnings are often proxies for the health of the American and global economy. And conditions have been ripe for Goldman and its competitors to mint money.Stock markets have been on a tear for months, while credit markets — far bigger than the equity markets — have continued to be robust. Credit derivatives continue to grow at a geometric pace, with $27 trillion outstanding. Opportunities abound to invest in companies, trade securities or advise clients in markets around the world, including China, Russia and the Middle East.Private equity firms continue to buy increasingly large companies — witness the Blackstone Group’s $36 billion acquisition of Equity Office Properties Trust, the nation’s largest office-building owner and manager, a deal Goldman advised on. And hedge funds, which account for 40 to 80 percent of trading in certain markets, represent significant profit-making potential for Wall Street — and, of course, for Wall Street’s persistent leader.For the year, Goldman produced record revenue of $37.7 billion and a record profit of $9.5 billion, or $19.69 a share.In the fourth quarter, the bank earned $3.15 billion, or $6.59 a share, on revenue of $9.41 billion. Investment banking revenue climbed 42 percent, to $1.3 billion, and trading and principal investments rose 57 percent, to $6.6 billion.“Our economists’ view is that we will continue to have good economic growth, somewhat slower in the U.S., somewhat better in Europe and very good in Asia,” Mr. Viniar said. And “our business tends to be tied to economic growth more than anything else.”Fueling Mr. Viniar’s optimism is the breadth of Goldman’s business as well as the number of deals the bank has in the pipeline, the so-called backlog. That pipeline is more robust than it has been at any point since 2000, Mr. Viniar said.Like many universal and investment banks, Goldman Sachs has transformed its business to capitalize on sea changes in the capital markets, particularly new opportunities in far-flung markets and a shift from issuing and trading plain-vanilla stocks and bonds to building and trading complex derivative products. That shift is apparent in the makeup of Goldman’s revenue.In 1997, investment banking and trading and principal investments produced roughly the same revenue ($2.6 billion and $2.9 billion, respectively), for total net revenue of $7.4 billion.In 2006, investment banking earned $5.6 billion while trading and principal investments produced $25.6 billion — almost 70 percent of the total $37.7 billion in net revenue.Goldman derives significant profits from acting as an investor, deploying the firm’s capital to buy and sell companies. In the second quarter, the bank spent $2.6 billion for a 5 percent stake in the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, China’s largest state-owned bank ($1.6 billion came from Goldman Sachs’s private equity funds and the remainder was financed off Goldman’s balance sheet). When the giant Chinese bank went public in October in the largest initial public offering ever, Goldman’s stake soared in value. For the fourth quarter, Goldman earned $949 million in profits from the investment.It made another half a billion dollars on the sale of the Accordia Golf Company, a portfolio of Japanese golf courses that Goldman began to acquire in 2001.Investors seemed to question whether the good times could continue. Goldman’s stock traded down $2.52, or 1.2 percent, to $200. “The stock being down almost shows they are victims of their own success,” said Jeffrey Harte, a securities industry analyst at Sandler O’Neill. “Ninety-seven percent year-on-year earnings growth is spectacular,” referring to earnings per share.Goldman’s returns do not come without significant risk. Banks use “value at risk” to calibrate how much money they could potentially lose in particular trading strategies over a set period of time. Goldman’s average value at risk soared 33 percent in the fourth quarter, to $106 million this year from $80 million at the end of November 2005. For the year, value at risk totaled $101 million, compared with $70 million in 2005.And yet Goldman’s size seems to insulate it from downturns in some of its businesses. For example, the firm has aggressively developed internal hedge funds for wealthy investors, which generate high fees for Goldman. The bank’s flagship hedge fund, Global Alpha, is down more than 11 percent from a year, a drastic change from 2005 when the fund returned more than 40 percent after fees. The impact of the fund’s poor performance will be booked in January, but fees from smaller accounts that match the strategies of Global Alpha were down 78 percent in the fourth quarter, to $23 million.Mr. Viniar acknowledged that the fund’s returns would adversely impact first quarter earnings but expressed optimism about the growth of the hedge fund industry.“The hedge fund asset class is a growing asset class,” he said. “It is one that is sensible. It is one that a lot of people with money to invest are interested in. It will continue to grow at a reasonable pace moving forward.”His unusual optimism did not completely outweigh his characteristic caution, however. Asked about the quality of deals in the backlog, Mr. Viniar was quick to point out, “Conditions in the capital markets can change quickly and no backlog is ever guaranteed.”'"
"'06-12-13,'1','Darrin Drake, whose family has farmed for at least 10 generations, said he did not need the government to keep track of the hundreds of cattle, goats, sheep and other livestock that roamed Peaceful Pastures, the farm here in mid-Tennessee that he and his wife bought in 1997.“To me, this is my backyard,” said Mr. Drake, who is 40. “Now, if you started going into town and getting into people’s backyards, they’d get a little irritated. It just happens that my backyard’s a little bigger than most people’s.”Mary-Louise Zanoni, a lawyer in upstate New York and the executive director of Farm for Life, an advocacy group for small farms, calls the effort a “scam” that will squeeze out small farmers.“The only reason for an animal identification system,” Ms. Zanoni said, “is to serve the economic interests of large meat packers and people who are going to sell the technology that will be indispensable in the system.”To participate, farmers register their “premises,” large or small, with the state, which passes their information on to the Agriculture Department. Registration is free. Of about 1.4 million premises nationwide, almost a quarter have been registered and assigned a seven-digit ID code, Mr. Knight said.The next phase calls for animals to be assigned 15-digit numbers and given tags, either individually or, in the case of animals that are sold in lots, like pigs and poultry, collectively, according to the agency’s user guide for the system. Electronic tags are expected to cost $2 to $3 each, and it is likely that scanners will be used to read them, tracking the path from barnyard to slaughterhouse.Amish farmers, who do not believe in using technology, also frown on tagging. “We would be conscientiously opposed and have religious convictions against the identification system,” one Amish farmer from Wisconsin wrote to Ms. Zanoni.The push intensified in late 2001 after an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in Europe and as fears of agroterrorism attacks on the United States food supply grew after Sept. 11. Additional pressure came with the first case of mad cow disease in the United States in 2003 and the ban on American meat by dozens of countries, said Robert Fourdraine, chairman of the ID committee for the National Institute for Animal Agriculture, an industry group.Debate over whether the program would be compulsory proved so intense that the entire effort stalled. The only way to get it moving again was to put to rest fears about a mandate, Mr. Knight said.But some animal tracking supporters argue that a voluntary system will not work. Emmit Rawls, a professor of agricultural economics at the University of Tennessee, said one diseased animal that had not been tagged and therefore could not be tracked could have enormous consequences.But Mr. Knight said that while full participation seemed unlikely, a voluntary system would be effective.Not all farmers oppose the program. Kenneth P. Garrett, 73, who has a herd of about 75 beef cattle in Cannon County, Tenn., said fear of change was driving the opposition. “I don’t see any problem with it,” Mr. Garrett said. “I don’t see how it could do anything but good in the long run.”But the program has led to alarm and confusion. In Tennessee, some farmers were angered to learn they must be enrolled in the program to qualify for state grants. Others discovered that if they had participated in other disease eradication programs, they were assigned premise numbers and registration cards.Virginia Youmans, who has sheep and other livestock on a 53-acre family farm in Lynnville, received a bar-coded premise ID card in the mail.The program “goes against everything that we believe in about privacy and private property,” Ms. Youmans said. She said that their philosophical objections and the program’s expense would probably keep her and her husband from turning the farm into the business they had dreamed of.“We want to stay here and we want to keep it in farming,” she said. “If we have to go through all that, then we probably won’t.”'"
"'06-12-13,'1','As chairman of the Federal Reserve, Ben Bernanke is the nation’s top inflation cop. When he expresses alarm — as he has done of late over rising labor costs — his concern drives policy, as it apparently did yesterday when the Fed’s interest rate committee decided to hold rates steady in a bid to dampen inflationary pressures.But of all the reasons Mr. Bernanke might have for fretting about inflation, rising wages should not be one of them. For starters, wage growth is slowing, not rising. True, wages were up three cents an hour last month. But researchers at the Economic Policy Institute who measured wages over three-month periods found that hourly wages slowed from a 4.7 percent annual growth rate for June through August to 3.1 percent for September through November. Working Americans have more to spend lately, but that’s not because of any big acceleration in pay; rather, it’s because prices have eased, mainly for energy.Taking a broader view, the job market is — unfortunately — the last place one would look for signs of overheating in the Bush-era economy. Of the four economic expansions in modern times that have lasted at least five years, the current one has the worst job creation record by far. This year, job growth has averaged just enough to absorb the new job seekers entering the labor force each month.Which leads us back to Mr. Bernanke. Where does his fear about inflationary wage pressures come from? Perhaps the importance of establishing his inflation-fighting credentials is causing him to react strongly to any perceived threats. For instance, if workers took advantage of lower gas prices to spend freely elsewhere, inflation could conceivably break out. But there is not much evidence of that so far.Or maybe Mr. Bernanke is worried that pay raises in relatively strong job fields — like engineering, law and health care — will soon be passed on to consumers. Betting that companies will compel consumers, rather than shareholders, to foot the bill for higher salaries could prove to be a safe wager.Another good bet at this point is, sadly, that the economy will continue to downshift in 2007, removing any upward wage pressures that may exist. An economy that has not been good for jobs and wages during its strong growth phase is not likely to become so as it weakens.'"
"'06-12-13,'1','One of the many areas of government neglect that needs urgent fixing is the lack of supervision of dollar burners like the Iraq war and homeland security: the Pentagon says it has 100,000 civilians now in Iraq on government contracts. Yet the new head of the General Services Administration — an executive agency that manages over $55 billion in contracts for Iraq, homeland security and other areas — is intent on cutting the budget of her agency’s inspector general.The inspector general is one of the independent watchdogs created by Congress to make sure taxpayers get their money’s worth from mammoth agencies like the G.S.A. But the G.S.A. chief, Lurita Alexis Doan, plans a $5 million cut for the inspector’s office, aiming to replace some government auditors with hires from the private sector. Ms. Doan, who was appointed by President Bush, arrived from the private sector herself as a dynamic company executive vowing to wield a cost-effective broom.Nice to hear. But privatizing oversight of private contractors is no way to protect taxpayers. Indeed, the inspector general has become an increasingly endangered species all over Washington. Congressional Republicans penciled out the budget line for another independent watchdog they found embarrassingly effective in tracking major corruption in Iraq reconstruction. Once discovered, the departing Congress withdrew the knife. The G.S.A.’s boss had better sense what’s in the air.'"
"'06-12-13,'1','Relations between the exchanges are frosty. Executives from London never agreed to negotiate with Nasdaq. They have not contacted Nasdaq executives since Nasdaq said in November that it planned a £12.43-a-share bid, several people on both sides of the bidding process said.Getting just over 20 percent more of the London exchange’s shares might seem like an achievable task for Nasdaq, except that shares of the London market are trading above the offer value — they closed at £13.20 on Tuesday. Hedge fund investors, which hold an estimated 30 to 40 percent of the London exchange’s stock, have snapped up shares in recent weeks, anticipating a higher offer.Nasdaq cannot raise its offer, however, unless it receives a recommendation from the London exchange’s board, which has so far declined to cooperate, or unless another bidder steps in. Most analysts agree that there are no other likely bidders.If Nasdaq neither reaches the simple majority by the extended Feb. 10 deadline nor engages the London exchange’s board in discussions, it has to walk away from the offer and cannot make another one for a year.Many analysts in London say they consider it unlikely that the situation will be resolved even by the February deadline. In particular, they said, it was difficult to see why stockholders would take the £12.43 a share if the London exchange’s stock was trading above that level.But Nasdaq could indeed walk away in February, and hope that the London exchange’s shares slip enough in the year ahead that its next takeover attempt will be successful.Or the scores of fund managers who own stock in the London market could try to press its management into cutting a deal with Nasdaq.Many shareholders seem to be betting on a higher price.On Dec. 8, Horizon Asset Management and Kinetics Asset Management said they owned 6.4 percent of the London exchange. The two money managers paid as much as £13.14 a share for the stock, according to filings with the London Stock Exchange.Legal and General Investment Management, a London fund with £211 billion under management, said Tuesday that it held 3.74 percent of the London market and had bought shares at £13.20 each. State Street Global Advisors said Tuesday that it held 1.9 percent and had bought shares at £13.24.'"
"'06-12-13,'1','Stock options give their owner the right to buy stock for as long as 10 years at a price set when the options are granted. Google officials said they believed that employees typically underestimated their value.“It is very difficult for employees to understand what their options are worth,” said Dave Rolefson, Google’s equity and executive compensation manager, in an interview. “If they can see what others would pay for them, then option valuation would become simple for employees.”The new options, which will have lives of 10 years, will have the same vesting schedule as existing options, with some options vesting after 12 months and all vesting within four years. Once the options are vested, employees will be able to hold them, exercise them or sell them. They are likely to reap greater gains from selling than from exercising them.For example, an employee who holds a vested option permitting him to buy shares at a strike price of $460, assuming the stock is trading at $482, can currently exercise the option and pocket $22. The new transferable stock option could be worth a lot more than that, because of the expectation that the stock could rise further.Google said any options that are sold when their remaining life is greater than two years would immediately become two-year options. In those two years, the financial institution or investor buying them would not be able to sell the options in a secondary market, but would be able to use various financial instruments to hedge against fluctuations in Google’s stock price.The financial institution is likely to pay less than it would if the option life was not reduced, but much more than the employee would receive if he or she exercised the option and sold the stock.In trading yesterday, an option to buy Google for $460 a share in January 2009, a little more than two years from now, sold for $123.50 in trading at the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, far more than the value that would have come from exercising it now. A financial institution that bought such an option now from an employee probably would pay a price below that level, but not too far below it.Even options with strike prices higher than the value of the company’s stock — so-called underwater options — would probably have some value in the market being created, and they could be sold by Google employees. Yesterday, at the Chicago Board Options Exchange, a January 2009 option with a strike price of $520 sold for $99.80. For years, technology companies opposed efforts of accounting rule makers to force them to record as an expense the cost of options granted to employees. Since the rule went into effect last year, some have tried to change the terms of the options, or the assumptions made in valuing them, to reduce the reported expense. But Google’s change, because it will increase the expected life of the options, will raise the reported cost of each option.In the long run, however, Google’s reported profits could climb if it is able to offer fewer options to attract and retain employees.“We want to continue to use stock options, but we don’t want to be wasteful either,” Mr. Rolefson said. “We won’t need to use as many options to deliver the same value to employees.”Google is not the first company to offer employees the possibility of selling options, but it is the first to propose doing so regularly. In 2003, Microsoft arranged for J. P. Morgan to offer to purchase all options with exercise prices over $33 a share. Employees who took that offer have had no cause to regret it, because the share price has never risen to that level.Google said that its plan would be available to all employees other than the company’s most senior executives, who will continue to receive traditional options that can be exercised but not transferred. All stock options granted to employees since Google went public in 2004 will be converted into transferable options, resulting in a one-time accounting charge, the company said without disclosing how large the charge is expected to be. The plan is expected to go into effect in the second quarter of next year.Through September, Google had 6.6 million outstanding stock options that would be eligible for the plan. Dave Sobota, a Google lawyer, said the plan did not require the approval of the Securities and Exchange Commission.Nell Minow, editor of the Corporate Library, a research firm specializing in executive compensation and corporate governance, said Google had come up with an “elegant” solution to what she described as a “communications problem.”“It’s a very Google-esque solution, and it is a very ‘not evil’ solution,” Ms. Minow said, alluding to Google’s “Don’t be evil” corporate mantra. “I like that.”Still, Ms. Minow said she remained skeptical of stock options as an optimal way to motivate employees, not because employees lacked a full understanding of their value, but because they typically saw no direct link between their hard work as individuals and the company’s share price.“I’m skeptical it will be tremendously helpful to shareholders,” Ms. Minow said.Given Google’s prominent role in the technology industry and status as an innovator, some experts say that other companies are likely to emulate its new compensation plan.“I would be very surprised if the idea isn’t picked up by many more companies in a very short order,” said Joseph Grundfest, a professor of business and law at Stanford University, and co-director of the Arthur and Toni Rembe Rock Center for Corporate Governance. “If Google does it, it validates it as a smart idea.”But Ted Buyniski, a compensation consultant and senior vice president with Radford Surveys and Consulting, a subsidiary of the AON Corporation, cautioned that the problem Google faced was uncommon, as its high stock price sharpened the discrepancy between the financial and perceived value of its stock options. Employees tend to think that a $5 stock is more likely to go to $10, than a $500 stock is to go to $1,000, Mr. Buyniski said.“There is a perception among most employees that the higher a stock price is the less likely it is to go up further, even though that’s not necessarily true,” he said. Because of that, “other companies don’t necessarily have that same gap between perceived value and actual value” as Google.Given the costs in putting a transferable stock option plan into effect, it is unlikely that many other companies will rush to follow Google, Mr. Buyniski said.It is not clear how Google’s plan will change employee behavior. Economists generally say that employees typically exercise their options too quickly. By exposing the time value of options, the plan may encourage employees to hold their options for longer periods, said Mr. Grundfest, a former member of the S.E.C.Or, he said, it could prompt employees to cash out more quickly.“If you simply assume that by giving people an additional choice, they will elect that choice only if it is to their benefit, then it is likely to be an improvement all the way around,” Mr. Grundfest said.But Ms. Minow said that the plan could be detrimental if it encourages employees to sell their stock options more quickly.“I’d really like to see people hold on to their stock options and remain invested in their company, and not to think of them as a pipeline for cash exercise,” Ms. Minow said.'"

"'06-12-14,'1','The headline this morning in Le Soir, a major daily paper, was “Belgium Died Last Night.” And the nation’s leaders were no more amused by the broadcast than the newspaper was.“It’s very bad Orson Welles, in very poor taste,” Didier Seeuws, a spokesman for Prime Minister Guy Verhofstadt, told the national news agency Belga, recalling Welles’s 1938 radio adaptation of H.G. Wells’ “War of the Worlds,” which caused widespread chaos when thousands of American listeners believed that Martians really had touched down with heat rays and malign intent.“In the current context, it’s irresponsible for a public television channel to announce the end of Belgium as a reality, presented by genuine journalists,” he said.At the beginning of Wednesday evening’s broadcast, carried on the state television channel RTBF , a message was displayed at the bottom of the screen saying “This is perhaps not a fiction,” an oblique reference to the title of a painting of a pipe by the Belgian surrealist René Magritte, “This Is Not a Pipe.”But the playful disclaimer failed to allay real fears about the country’s dissolution. More than 2,000 callers jammed the switchboard at RTBF. Belgian diplomats around the world called authorities back home to find out whether the country’s federal system had indeed collapsed.“Embassies and ambassadors who were worried asked what they had to tell their capitals,” said the chairwoman of the Senate, Anne-Marie Lizin. “This fiction was seen as a reality, and it created a catastrophic image of the country.”At the insistence of the minister for media affairs for the French-speaking part of Belgium, Fadila Laanan, RTBF put a message saying “This is fiction” on the screen about a half-hour into the broadcast.Elio Di Rupo, leader of the Socialist party for French speakers, told Le Soir, “At a time when our country is rocked by separatist leanings, it is irresponsible and antisocial to make people believe that the Flemish have voted for independence.”The fact that the program was on state-funded television also rankled, especially among French speakers.“This program is irresponsible,” said the national finance minister, Didier Reynders. “It totally discredits an institution that the French community has put a lot of investment into.” Ms. Lanaan cophone media minister, said she would complain formally to RTBF officials about the “scandalous” mock newscast. “I also question the ethics of journalists who worked on this program,” she said.But RTBF defended the program, saying it was meant to spur a much-needed debate on the future of Belgium. Yves Thiran, the station’s information and ethics director, said the newscast showed “the importance of a topical political debate, the debate about the future of Belgium.”Political analysts said the broadcast tapped into deep concerns among Belgians about the unity of the country, especially in recent years, as nationalist and separatist sentiment has seemed to gain ground in Flanders along with a right-wing, anti-immigrant political party, the Vlaams Belang.The party, led by a telegenic former journalist named Filip Dewinter, has called for Flemish independence and has railed against multiculturalism; it won about 20 percent of the vote in recent municipal elections in Flanders.“For many decades, the free-market oriented Flemings have been subsidizing Socialist-dominated Wallonia,” Frank Vanhecke, the president of the party, has written on its pro-secessionist web site. “The Belgian Constitution gives the Francophones 50 percent of political power and a veto over major issues, which makes the French-speakers act as if they are the majority. The Flemings have had enough.”Belgium actually has three linguistic groups — about 60,000 German speakers live in eastern Wallonia — but the main cultural fault line in the country runs between the French- and Dutch-speaking regions. Complicating the picture is Brussels, the capital, which is an 85 percent Francophone island surrounded by Dutch-speaking Flanders. Many institutions in the country, including the major political parties, maintain more or less separate French and Dutch wings.Under Mr. Verhofstadt’s government, representatives of Belgium’s regions have sought to improve the working of the country’s federal system, which came into existence in the 1970s after decades of unitary state rule dominated by French speakers.In recent years, the regions have been given greater control over taxation, partly in response to complaints from Flanders over having to bear a heavy tax burden to support less prosperous Wallonia. Economic output per person is roughly 10 percent higher in Flanders than in Wallonia, which has suffered from the long decline of the country’s steel and coal industries.Some analysts said that the near-universal condemnation of the broadcast today was actually a positive sign of national unity.“The reactions show that there are still fears about Flemish nationalism in this country,” said Martin Buxant, a commentator for the Libre Belgique newspaper. “But people watching should have realized the program was a caricature, while its condemnation by most Belgians suggests that Belgium is more united than divided.”'"
"'06-12-14,'1','Ms. Pelosi also said the newly empowered House Democrats would also move to raise the minimum wage, now $5.15 per hour; advance stem cell research and roll back subsidies to “Big Oil,” all in the opening days of the next Congress — “the first 100 hours,” as she put it.“Let it be clear,” she said. “Democrats are prepared to govern and ready to lead.”She refused to speculate on what might happen if Senator Tim Johnson, the Democrat of South Dakota who is in critical condition after suffering a brain hemorrhage on Wednesday, cannot continue his duties. “Hopefully, we’re going to get some good news about his recovery,” she said.If Mr. Johnson left the Senate, his replacement would be named by South Dakota Gov. Mike Rounds, a Republican. Assuming Mr. Rounds named a member of his own party, control of the Senate would stay with Republicans, and House Democrats might not be able to do all that they envision.Democrats have signaled that they plan to assert more control over the billions of dollars a month being spent on the conflict in Iraq when they take charge of Congress in January.In interviews, the incoming Democratic chairmen of the House and Senate Budget Committees said they would demand a better accounting of the war’s cost and move toward integrating the spending into the regular federal budget, a signal of their intention to use the Congressional power of the purse more assertively to influence the White House’s management of the war.The lawmakers, Senator Kent Conrad of North Dakota and Representative John M. Spratt Jr. of South Carolina, said the administration’s approach of paying for extended military operations and related activities through a series of emergency requests had inhibited Congressional scrutiny of the spending and obscured the true price of the war.“They have been playing hide-the-ball,” Mr. Conrad said, “and that does not serve the Congress well nor the country well, and we are not going to continue that practice.”Mr. Spratt, who along with Mr. Conrad is examining how the Democratic Congress should funnel the war spending requests through the House and Senate, said, “We need to have a better breakout of the costs — period.” He is planning hearings for early next year on the subject even as the White House readies a new request for $120 billion or more to pay for the war through Sept. 30, in addition to the more than $70 billion in emergency appropriations already spent this year.Since the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, spending on the military outside of the regular budget process, primarily for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, has totaled more than $400 billion. For the 12 months ended Sept. 30, spending on the Iraq war alone ran at an average rate of $8 billion a month, according to a study by the Congressional Research Service.Congressional control over the money for the war is one of the most powerful weapons Democrats will have in trying to influence administration policy toward Iraq. They can use both the budget and subsequent spending bills to impose restrictions on how the money is spent and demand more information from the White House.While the leadership has repeatedly said it will not cut off money for military operations, senior Democratic officials said lawmakers were considering whether to add conditions to spending bills to force the administration to meet certain standards for progress or change in Iraq. Democrats have also said they intend to investigate spending and suspicions of corruption, waste and abuse in Iraq contracting.Since the beginning of the war, the White House has said that costs should be considered outside the routine federal budget because they are unpredictable and military demands can change quickly. Republicans have also said that wars have traditionally been treated as emergency spending, but the costs of the extended Vietnam War, for instance, were eventually absorbed into the normal budget.But Mr. Bush has decided not to include the costs of the war in the budget request he sends to Congress each February. The Republican Congress has acceded to his request that money be appropriated for the conflict on an expedited, as-needed basis that sidesteps much of the process by which the House and Senate normally debate spending priorities.But the newly completed report of the Iraq Study Group stated that the “costs for the war in Iraq should be included in the president’s annual budget request,” beginning with the budget to be submitted early next year. In addition, a little noticed provision added to a defense policy measure signed into law by Mr. Bush in October directed him to include in his budget a request for appropriations for military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, an estimate of all money expected to be required for the year, and a detailed justification of the request.“The law requires that it be done,” Mr. Conrad said, adding that he had told the incoming defense secretary, Robert M. Gates, that the administration must change its budgeting strategy.But Sean Kevelighan, a spokesman for the Office of Management and Budget, said the administration’s view was that Congress could not “bind how the president wants to put together the budget,” though he said the administration was trying to provide more information for Congress and moving toward a more regular budget plan.“It is obviously difficult to predict the cost of the war 12 to 18 months out,” Mr. Kevelighan said. “But our goal is to provide more information to the American people as to how much, for what and when.”Both Republicans and Democrats have objected to the administration’s refusal to add the war costs to the budget, particularly when the conflict has lasted almost four years. “It is hard to comprehend with an ongoing event like the war that there wouldn’t be something on it in the budget,” said Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the Democratic leader.In June, the Senate overwhelmingly approved a proposal by Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, to require the president to spell out the expected war costs in his annual spending plan. At the time, some lawmakers expected that the provision would be eliminated from the final measure, but it survived and could be held up by Democrats as evidence that the administration was ignoring the law if it failed to comply.Lawmakers have several objections to treating the war spending as a continuous emergency, which typically sends the request straight to the Appropriations Committee and bypasses the more policy-oriented Armed Services Committees. Mr. Spratt said he believed that the policy panels tended to give such requests a “closer scrub” than the appropriations panels.Others say the emergency measures, known as supplemental appropriation requests, can become vehicles for lawmakers to win speedy approval of their own, unrelated pet projects. Members of Congress say the Pentagon has also increasingly seen the war measures as a route to winning financing for projects that should be subject to normal review. And there are complaints that the administration’s approach masks the true cost of the war by not providing a clear bottom line number and by not calculating such related expenses as increased veterans care and military equipment.“We are now going on four years into this war and they are still funding it with these patchwork supplementals without oversight and without accountability,” Mr. Conrad said, “and that just has to stop.”But adding the war costs to the annual budget could carry risks for Democrats who want to write a spending plan that meets their priorities but eliminates the deficit in five years or so. Adding the war spending at the same time Democrats want to enforce “pay as you go” budget rules would require some of that spending to be made up by reductions elsewhere.And if Mr. Bush’s budget does not contain the spending and the Congressional plan does, the president’s blueprint could look better by comparison when it comes to deficit reduction. In addition, budget writers do not want Pentagon spending inflated by the war to become a permanent new floor for the military budget.'"

"'06-12-14,'1','Some dangerous chemicals could be banned from the European market, and about 30,000 substances used in everyday products ranging from detergents to toys will have to be registered in a central European Union database under a new law. The European Parliament passed the law, one of the most complex and far-reaching commission regulations ever, after years of haggling marked by intense lobbying by the European chemicals industry and by protests from environmentalists who sought more restraints on the industry. The law, a compromise balancing health and environmental concerns against fears that excessive red tape would stifle business, puts the burden of proof on companies to show that industrial chemicals and substances used in everyday products are safe. It is likely to take effect in mid-2007.'"
"'06-12-14,'1','The agency found that the three organizations, Swift Boat Veterans, the League of Conservation Voters and MoveOn.org’s Voter Fund, had violated election laws by acting as political action committees while not registering with or filing reports listing donors and contributions with the agency, as political action committees are required to do.The agency found that some of the groups’ activities crossed the line by soliciting donations and then spending the money with the express purpose of electing or defeating particular federal candidates. Those actions, it said, triggered the 2002 McCain-Feingold law’s cap on donations to a political action committee of $5,000 per year for individuals or $10,000 each election cycle.In 2004, 527 committees spent nearly $500 million, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, which monitors campaign giving and spending. In this year’s midterm elections, the groups had spent nearly $175 million as of Oct. 23, according to the center.The election commission has been under pressure to regulate the 527 groups, which flourish under a loophole in the McCain-Feingold law. The agency faces a deadline imposed by a federal judge to come up with a better rationale for why it continues to review complaints filed mainly by campaign finance organizations against the 527 groups “case by case.”Calling its practice of individual reviews “a total failure,” Judge Emmet Sullivan of Federal District Court here ordered the agency to broaden its explanation for such reviews or to issue a rule that would apply to all 527’s. In the spring, the F.E.C. rejected a uniform rule to regulate these groups, although advocacy groups continue to press in court for more regulation.The Campaign Legal Center and Democracy 21, two of the campaign reform groups that are involved in the court cases, issued a statement on Wednesday calling the F.E.C.’s actions “too little, too late.”Fred Wertheimer, the head of Democracy 21, said, “The bottom line, the way to provide clear guidance for everyone — the public and the 527 groups — is through clear standards and rules.” The agency said the Swift Boat Veterans group spent $22.6 million attacking Senator John Kerry and, in some mailings and advertisements, advocated his defeat.The group is technically still in operation, continuing to file reports with the Internal Revenue Service, largely reporting expenses for legal bills to the firm of Patton Boggs. Benjamin L. Ginsberg, who was forced to resign his post with the Bush-Cheney campaign in 2004 because of his ties to the group, signed the settlement papers with the agency. The group denied that it had expressly advocated for anyone, but agreed to the settlement.""It is far better to end this legal confrontation now rather than continue a costly battle against government bureaucrats in an area where the law is unconscionably vague,"" said Rear Adm. Roy Hoffmann, founder of the Swift Boat Veterans and P.O.W.’s for Truth. While Swift Boat Veterans was not active in the midterm elections, Mr. Perry, its major donor, continued to finance new 527 groups like the Free Enterprise Fund that supported Republican candidates and opposed Democrats in several states.The League of Conservation Voters will pay a $180,000 penalty. The agency found that it financed the Environmental Victory project, spending nearly $1 million by canvassing swing voters in tightly contested states and advocating the election of Mr. Kerry and the defeat of George W. Bush. The MoveOn.org Voter Fund will pay a $150,000 penalty. The agency said it had not found that the group expressly advocated the election or defeat of a federal candidate. But in spending $21 million in the 2004 cycle, the group financed advertisements that opposed Mr. Bush, the agency said.Wes Boyd, one of its founders, issued a statement on Wednesday that said the Voter Fund was defunct, and that MoveOn’s separate political action committee adhered to federal donation limits.'"
"'06-12-14,'1','But experts also cautioned that circumcision is no cure-all. It only lessens the chances that a man will catch the virus; it is expensive compared to condoms, abstinence or other methods; and the surgery has serious risks if performed by folk healers using dirty blades, as often happens in rural Africa.Circumcision is “not a magic bullet, but a potentially important intervention,” said Dr. Kevin M. De Cock, director of H.I.V./AIDS for the World Health Organization.Sex education messages for young men need to make it clear that “this does not mean that you have an absolute protection,” said Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, an AIDS researcher and director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.Circumcision should be used with other prevention methods, he said, and it does nothing to prevent spread by anal sex or drug injection, ways in which the virus commonly spreads in the United States.The two trials, conducted by researchers from universities in Illinois, Maryland, Canada, Uganda and Kenya, involved nearly 3,000 heterosexual men in Kisumu, Kenya, and nearly 5,000 in Rakai, Uganda. None were infected with H.I.V. They were divided into circumcised and uncircumcised groups, given safe sex advice (although many presumably did not take it), and retested regularly.The trials were stopped this week by the N.I.H. Data Safety and Monitoring Board after data showed that the Kenyan men had a 53 percent reduction in new H.I.V. infection. Twenty-two of the 1,393 circumcised men in that study caught the disease, compared with 47 of the 1,391 uncircumcised men.In Uganda, the reduction was 48 percent.Those results echo the finding of a trial completed last year in Orange Farm, a township in South Africa, financed by the French government, which demonstrated a reduction of 60 percent among circumcised men.The two largest agencies dedicated to fighting AIDS said they would now be willing to pay for circumcisions, which they have not before because there was too little evidence that it worked.Dr. Richard G. A. Feachem, executive director of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, which has almost $5 billion in pledges, said in a television interview that if a country submitted plans to conduct sterile circumcisions, “I think it’s very likely that our technical panel would approve it.”Dr. Mark Dybul, executive director of President Bush’s $15 billion Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, said in a statement that his agency “will support implementation of safe medical male circumcision for H.I.V./AIDS prevention” if world health agencies recommend it.He also warned that it was only one new weapon in the fight, adding, “Prevention efforts must reinforce the A.B.C. approach — abstain, be faithful, and correct and consistent use of condoms.”Researchers have long noted that parts of Africa where circumcision is common — particularly the Muslim countries of West Africa — have much lower AIDS rates, while those in southern Africa, where circumcision is rare, have the highest.But drawing conclusions was always confounded by other regional factors, like strict Shariah law in some Muslim areas, rape and genocide in East Africa, polygamy, rites that require widows to have sex with a relative, patronage of prostitutes by miners, and men’s insistence on dangerous “dry sex” — with the woman’s vaginal walls robbed of secretions with desiccating herbs.Outside Muslim regions, circumcision is spotty. In South Africa, for example, the Xhosa people circumcise teenage boys, while Zulus do not. AIDS is common in both tribes.Nelson Mandela’s autobiography, “Long Walk to Freedom,” contains an unnerving but hilarious account of his own Xhosa circumcision, by spear blade, as a teenager. Although he was supposed to shout, “I am a man!” he grimaced in pain, he wrote.But not all initiation ceremonies are laughing matters. Every year, some South African teenagers die from infections, and the use of one blade on many young men may help spread AIDS.In recent years, as word has spread that circumcision might be protective, many southern African men have sought it out. A Zambian hospital offered $3 circumcisions last year, and Swaziland trained 60 doctors to do them for $40 after waiting lists at its national hospital grew.“Private practitioners also do it,” Dr. Halperin said. “In some places, it’s $20; in others, much more. Lots of the wealthy elite have already done it. It prevents S.T.D.’s, it’s seen as cleaner, sex is better, women like it. I predict that a lot of men who can’t afford private clinics will start clamoring for it.” (S.T.D.’s are sexually transmitted diseases.)Male circumcision also benefits women. For example, a study of the medical records of 300 Ugandan couples last year estimated that circumcised men infected with H.I.V. were about 30 percent less likely to transmit it to their female partners.Earlier studies on Western men have shown that circumcision significantly reduces the rate at which men infect women with the virus that causes cervical cancer. A study published in 2002 in The New England Journal of Medicine found that uncircumcised men were about three times as likely as circumcised ones with a similar number of sexual partners to carry the human papillomavirus.The suspected mechanism was the same — cells on the inside of the foreskin were also more susceptible to that virus, which is not closely related to H.I.V.'"
"'06-12-14,'1','On Tuesday afternoon, investigators showed up at the hotel, the Fox Manor, on Pacific Avenue, after learning that there might be a lead there on a suspect, the general manager, Manny Trivedi, said.Yesterday Mr. Trivedi said in a telephone interview that the hotel guest he was thinking of kept six to eight pairs of women’s shoes in his room. Mr. Trivedi described that man as being of medium height and weight, with blue eyes, thinning brown hair and a mustache.Mr. Trivedi and another manager at the hotel, who said he saw the shoe collection, and who spoke on the condition that his name not be used because of his concern about the continuing investigation, said that during the man’s three-week visit, a woman staying at the hotel told him that the man had mentioned to her that he was interested in caressing her feet.Mr. Trivedi said that after the woman, whom he would only identify as Michelle, read the Internet description of the theorized killer — which was produced by an independent group in New Jersey that profiles serial killers on a Web site called Stalk Inc. and has no links to the police in this case — she became alarmed and told him about her odd encounters with the hotel guest. He added that on Tuesday the police spent about two hours interviewing the woman, who has been staying at the hotel for about five months.“He also told this woman, Michelle, that he was an ex-marine and knew tae kwon do or something like that and could kill someone in a minute,” Mr. Trivedi recalled her telling him.The hotel managers said that the man they described had spent time with a man from the area who is believed to drive a white van, the type of vehicle some prostitutes on Pacific Avenue say might have been involved in the killings.Mr. Trivedi said that on Monday, a uniformed officer from the Atlantic City Police Department gave him a copy of the partial profile on the Stalk Inc. Web site and that the next day an investigator from the Atlantic County prosecutor’s office came to get a copy of it, as well as a copy of the former hotel guest’s driver’s license, which the hotel had on file.The Atlantic County prosecutor, Jeffrey S. Blitz, said yesterday that no one from the task force looking into the case had been distributing the Web-based profile. Asked yesterday about the man with the women’s shoes, Mr. Blitz declined to comment.The task force includes representatives from the prosecutor’s office, the Egg Harbor Township and Atlantic City Police Departments, the state police and the F.B.I.The victims, who the medical examiner said were left in the ditch over a period of several weeks, were found barefoot, their heads all facing east toward Atlantic City. One victim was strangled, another died of asphyxiation and the bodies of the two others were too badly decomposed to determine the causes of death.The description on the Web site asserted that the “lethal predator” responsible for the four deaths was from the area and was familiar with the site where the bodies were left.“He has not killed every prostitute he has come in contact with,” the document theorized. “There are prostitutes who know him for the sexual gratification he gets from their feet.”The description theorized that the killer probably had a record of sexually or physically abusing women. It was released by John Kelly, the president of Stalk Inc., who described himself as a social worker and addiction specialist. He said he had compiled criminal profiles in several well-publicized murders, including the Green River Killer case in Washington state and another in which the bodies of four women — all former heroin-addicted prostitutes in Worcester, Mass. — were found over the last several years.Mr. Kelly described his theory about the Atlantic City killer this way: “He can relive his fantasy through the shoes, which serve as somewhat of a trophy.”He said that he told the police in Egg Harbor Township three weeks ago that he had come up with a partial profile of the person who could be responsible for killing the four women. They referred all questions about the investigation to the county prosecutor.“We told them to watch the Web site for updates,” he said. “A profile always continues to evolve. But it’s only a tool. It’s up to the police as to what they want to do with it.”'"
"'06-12-14,'1','NEW ORLEANS, Dec. 13 (Reuters) — A federal jury in New Orleans gave Merck & Company a swift victory on Wednesday in the latest Vioxx product liability suit, finding that the company had adequately warned of the heart risks associated with the arthritis pain reliever.The jury took less than two hours to decide that Vioxx was not the primary cause of a heart attacked suffered by Anthony Dedrick, 51, in 2003 and that Mr. Dedrick’s doctor had adequate warning of the risks.Mr. Dedrick, who had a list of risk factors for heart attacks, including high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes and the buildup of plaque in his arteries, had been seeking $200,000 in damages — a relatively small amount in such cases.Merck is facing more than 27,000 lawsuits from people who say they were harmed by Vioxx, which was withdrawn from the market in September 2004 after a study showed that it doubled the risk of heart attack and stroke in patients taking it for at least 18 months.The drug maker has said it will fight each lawsuit, case by case, rather than submit to a broad settlement agreement.Of the Vioxx trials that have reached jury verdicts, Merck has won seven and lost four.'"
"'06-12-14,'1','Mr. Yu, an Oxford-trained economist whose institute will be the location for a major speech on Friday by Ben S. Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, said Ms. Wu was not seen in China as especially sympathetic to the main American demand in the talks — that China stop manipulating its currency in order to expand exports.“I have been arguing for a change in economic policy for years, but my voice is quite lonely,” Mr. Yu said. He added that however understanding Ms. Wu might be, she and the Communist Party are largely beholden to China’s export sector, which accounts for more than a third of the country’s economy.The United States wants China to let its currency, the yuan, float in relation to the dollar. Most economists say this would cause it to rise in value, raising the cost of exports for American consumers and reducing the cost of imports into China. Congressional leaders and business executives say currency reform should be Mr. Paulson’s priority.The American argument is that it is in China’s interest for it to channel its surplus of investment capital not into export industries, but into improving the lives of Chinese citizens and promoting a service- and consumer-led economy that does not use as much energy to run and does not further degrade the environment.But a transition to that kind of economy could take years, maybe decades. Moreover, some economists argue that the fixation on the dollar-yuan relationship is a distraction from larger problems like the low savings rate in the United States and low consumption in China.In the meantime, the Chinese fear that letting the yuan float upwards could weaken China’s export-driven economy. The textile industry alone supports 90 million workers but makes minuscule profit, Mr. Yu said, so a drop in sales could force millions out of work or require more subsidies to keep them employed.Mr. Paulson arrived here Wednesday with Commerce Secretary Carlos M. Gutierrez; Labor Secretary Elaine L. Chao; Health and Human Services Secretary Michael O. Leavitt; Energy Secretary Samuel W. Bodman; Susan C. Schwab, the United States trade representative; and Stephen L. Johnson, head of the Environmental Protection Agency.The meeting of the American and Chinese teams began Thursday morning in a cavernous room in the Great Hall of the People, where the two sides were arrayed in tiers on opposite sides of the room.Ms. Wu’s opening remarks, according to a text provided by the Chinese government, declared that “some American friends” had “much misunderstanding about the reality in China."" She then offered a lengthy discussion of China’s history going back 5,000 years and focusing on its maintaining a “socialist market economy system” with state-owned enterprises as a “mainstay.”Aside from general promises to continue opening China’s economy to outside investment and market forces and to protect the intellectual property rights of American makers of videos, software and other goods, there were no pledges to take further actions the United States wants.There were also no references to currency policies, except to say that China would “bring into better play the basic role of the market” in allocating resources. “Reform and opening up are the most distinct characteristics of contemporary China,” she declared.Mr. Paulson, in shorter opening remarks, also repeated familiar themes, declaring that China and the United States were responsible for half the world’s recent economic growth and must produce “tangible results” from the dialogue started this week.For China, he said, that meant opening markets further, promoting domestic consumption and allowing currency values to fluctuate according to market forces.But although Congress is calling for quick action, Mr. Paulson said he understood that various reforms should be enacted “over the next several years,” suggesting that there were no quick fixes.“As you know, there is resistance in both our countries to greater integration into the global economy,” Mr. Paulson said. “and there is also skepticism that this dialogue will accomplish anything of substance.” He said he had “no doubt” that positive results could come out of the talks.Before Thursday’s session, the two sides announced several trade deals, including sales of General Electric aircraft engines and fire trucks from the Oshkosh Truck Corporation, as well as the sale of a small Chinese retail chain to Home Depot.The goal is to discuss a range of issues as a way of coaxing the Chinese to move on America’s economic priorities. Besides their demands on currency manipulation, American officials would like China to open its economy further to foreign investment and services and crack down on piracy of videos, software, pharmaceuticals and other items.A senior Bush administration official who knows Ms. Wu said it was not clear how much influence she would have in overcoming the problems, even though she had a record of advocating some modernization to make the Chinese economy less dependent on exports.“She’s an impressive interlocutor, very direct and very capable of getting things done,” said the official, who said he could be more candid if not quoted by name. “I don’t think that’s the concern. The concern will be frankly whether she and the other forces for change continue down the path of reform.”Ms. Wu, 66, short in stature and with a no-nonsense and occasionally blunt manner, is known even by the Chinese as the “iron lady” of bureaucratic politics. She toiled in her early years as an engineer in the petroleum industry and served as vice mayor of Beijing, tirelessly advocating foreign investment to create jobs.She has been described for years as a “rising star” in the Communist Party, though she is due to retire next year. In past negotiations, such as the bargaining over China’s entry into the World Trade Organization in 2000, she was seen more as an operations manager than a policy maker.Ms. Wu’s predicted retirement parallels Mr. Paulson’s expected tenure. He himself has only two more years in office. Yet both sides say their dialogue will take many years to yield results, producing a natural wariness of concessions upfront.The Chinese figure most likely to make the decisions on what reforms are possible is Prime Minister Wen Jiabao, to whom Ms. Wu reports. But Mr. Wen, who is in charge of foreign policy, is considered a cautious consensus-builder with an aversion to anything that could make China unstable.Ms. Wu is further handicapped, political experts say, by the sidelining of a top member of the Politburo, Huang Ju, who has been associated with past banking and currency reforms. Mr. Huang has been kept out of the talks by illness and his association with corruption scandals in Shanghai, where he was party chief.As a result of all these problems, American officials have for months tried to lower expectations. They also proclaim their interest in listening to China’s agenda, though it will be at least as difficult for the United States to deliver what China wants as it is for China to meet the American agenda.For example, China wants the United States to raise its own savings rate and cut its budget deficit and reliance on consumer borrowing, which are blamed for the influx of Chinese goods and capital. Mr. Paulson cannot easily deliver on that even if he has a compliant Congress, which he will not.The Beijing government also charges that it could shift the trade imbalance and import more American goods if the Bush administration relaxed tight controls on high technology exports with sensitive military applications. The Bush administration has rejected that request.China also wants the United States to lift barriers to banks getting licenses in the United States and appears to be freezing efforts by American banks to set up offices in China in retaliation. But the Federal Reserve has effectively barred Chinese banks, claiming they have failed to meet Western standards on transparency.Finally, China would like to sell some of its estimated $700 billion in dollar-denominated reserves, earned after years of trade surpluses, and acquire American corporate assets.Most of all, China is hoping that this week’s dialogue will enable it to educate Americans about China’s economic problems, easing the pressure on it to act. But this desire comes just as the Bush administration says it needs Chinese action to ward off protectionist measures aimed at China in Congress.'"
"'06-12-14,'1','Some officials said the two proposals could blunt attempts to impose other tougher regulations or disclosure requirements on hedge funds. Six months ago, a federal appeals court said the commission exceeded its authority when it tried to force hedge fund managers to register with it.The S.E.C. also adopted a rule that would save corporations the expense of mailing financial reports and proxy statements by enabling them to communicate with the vast majority of their investors through the Internet. (Investors can continue to receive paper copies of proxies and other material through the mail if they request them.)And it proposed rules that would make it easier and less costly for banks to offer brokerage services.Taken together, the proposals and rules are expected to provide enormous savings for public companies and Wall Street investment houses. Senior officials at the commission said the proposals and rules would not reduce the regulatory protections already afforded to investors.The S.E.C.’s deregulatory push came a day after the Justice Department, in response to similar complaints, imposed new limits on federal prosecutors in white-collar corruption cases. Under those new guidelines, prosecutors in the field will now have to obtain permission from senior officials before trying to get companies that are under investigation to waive their attorney-client privilege.In weighing whether to seek the indictment of a company, the prosecutors will also no longer be permitted to consider whether the company is paying the legal fees of an employee involved in the inquiry.In recent weeks, Bush administration officials and business groups have criticized some of the changes in corporate law, securities rules and criminal procedures that were enacted in the wake of accounting frauds five years ago at Enron, WorldCom and other highflying companies.It remains to be seen whether the decisions by the commission and the Justice Department will take political pressure off Congress to go further, or whether the business groups that have been critical of the S.E.C. rules and the Justice Department’s approach will be able to persuade lawmakers to retrench further.The commission’s votes on all the measures Wednesday were unanimous, testimony to both the changed regulatory climate and the political skills of the agency’s chairman, Christopher Cox, a former Republican member of Congress. He tailored the changes to avoid the divisiveness that had troubled the tenure of his predecessor.Mr. Cox said the unifying theme of the proposals and the new rules was to increase the competitiveness and transparency of companies and markets.“If America’s markets aren’t competitive, investors lose,” he said. “If America’s markets are not transparent and open, investors lose.”Like the decision at the Justice Department, the changes announced by the commission on Wednesday fell short of what some companies and groups had sought. In the case of the auditing rules, for instance, many businesses had sought an exemption from the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. That provision requires public companies to assess the controls they have put in place to ensure that their financial reports are reliable.Instead of a blanket exemption, officials said, the proposed guidance would give many small companies a powerful new tool in restricting their auditors from engaging in what the executives viewed as expensive and unnecessary audits of financial controls that had minimum impact on financial statements. A companion new auditing standard is to be proposed next week by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board.Under the guidance proposed by the S.E.C., executives would evaluate the design of only those financial controls that might carry the risk of having a material impact on financial statements. Commission officials emphasized that the guidance is being drafted to be less onerous on smaller or less intricate companies.“Companies of all sizes and complexities will be able to conduct their evaluations more effectively and efficiently by following the proposed guidance,” Mr. Cox said. “As smaller companies have less complex internal control systems than larger companies, this approach enables smaller companies, in particular, to scale and tailor their evaluation methods and procedures to fit their own facts and circumstances.”'"
"'06-12-14,'1','BP, the oil giant, said yesterday that federal regulators were considering bringing civil charges against it in connection with trading activities in the gasoline futures market four years ago.BP, which is based in London, said it was notified by investigators at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission last month that they intended to recommend a civil enforcement action against the company for trading activities in unleaded gasoline on Oct. 31, 2002.The announcement is the latest setback for BP, whose businesses in the United States have been under frequent scrutiny by regulators over the last two years.The company provided documents and testimony related to the investigation, according to a regulatory filing BP made yesterday with the Securities and Exchange Commission.The company denied any wrongdoing and said it was ready to make its case before a judge, a BP spokesman, Scott Dean, said.'"
"'06-12-14,'1','The United States Mint, concerned that rising metal prices could lead to widespread recycling of pennies and nickels, has banned melting or exporting them.The Mint is also testing dozens of cheaper alternative metal compositions in the expectation that Congress will mandate a change when it meets in the new year.According to calculations by the Mint, the metal value of pennies, which are made of copper-coated zinc, is now more than one cent. The metal value of 5-cent coins, made from a copper-nickel blend, is up to 7 cents. Adding in the costs of manufacturing means the Mint now spends 1.73 cents for every penny and 8.74 cents for every nickel it makes.Until 1982, pennies were made of 95 percent copper. The commodity metal value of one of those coins, which still make up a large percentage of the pennies in circulation, is 2.13 cents, according to the Mint.If even 1 percent of the 150 billion pennies and 20 billion nickels in circulation were claimed for salvage, replacing them would cost taxpayers $43 million, the Mint estimates.In an interview yesterday, Edmund C.

Without the ban, which takes effect tomorrow, it would be.The new ban also forbids exporting pennies or nickels in any significant quantities.

"'06-12-14,'1','BAGHDAD, Dec. 13 — Car bombs exploded in crowded street markets in two predominantly Shiite neighborhoods of eastern Baghdad on Wednesday, killing at least 15 people and wounding at least 35, Iraqi and American officials said.The deadliest attack, in the working-class district of Kamaliya, killed at least 10 people and wounded 25, scattering bodies and reducing several cars and a row of market stalls to charred, smoldering husks, officials said.Several hours later, two car bombs exploded almost simultaneously on a busy street in the nearby neighborhood of Baghdad al Jedida, killing at least five people and wounding at least 10, an official at the Interior Ministry said. Car bombs are a common tactic of the Sunni Arab-led insurgency and are frequently detonated in places where Shiites congregate, seemingly with the intent of inflicting the most casualties possible, fomenting sectarian violence and further destabilizing the Shiite-dominated government.Dozens of other Iraqis were killed across Iraq on Wednesday, according to police and military reports shared with the news media.Two suicide car bombers detonated their vehicles at the gate of an Iraqi Army regiment responsible for protecting Iraq’s oil pipelines, said Col. Abdul Sattar al-Jibouri, a police commander in Kirkuk. Seven Iraqi soldiers were killed and 14 others were wounded in that attack, he said.A group of gunmen killed nine Shiites, all from the same family, in the town of Hasna, a police official in the nearby city of Kut said. An adviser at the Transportation Ministry was kidnapped by gunmen near the ministry’s headquarters in Baghdad, the Interior Ministry official said, and at least 21 bodies were recovered around Baghdad, all with gunshots to the head and signs of torture.Four mortar shells hit an apartment block popular with Palestinians in the eastern neighborhood of Baladiat, killing one Palestinian and wounding six, the Interior Ministry official said.'"
"'06-12-14,'1','BEIJING, Dec. 13 — An outspoken Chinese human rights lawyer was put on trial this week, accused of inciting subversion, but authorities kept such tight control over the proceeding that his lawyer and family were prevented from attending, his lawyer said Wednesday.Gao Zhisheng, the human rights lawyer, was tried Tuesday at Beijing’s No. 1 People’s Intermediate Court. The proceeding lasted less than a day and was conducted in open court, but Mr. Gao’s relatives and their chosen lawyer, Mo Shaoping, were never notified. No verdict has been announced.“This hearing did not follow the proper legal procedures,” Mr. Mo said. “They didn’t even inform the family.”Mr. Gao’s trial occurred after rulings in two other controversial cases were announced this month in different Chinese courts. In Shandong Province, in eastern China, a trial court reinstated a guilty verdict against Chen Guangcheng, a blind legal expert who had spoken out against local abuses of population control policies. His lawyers complained that local officials had barred important defense witnesses from the trial.In Beijing, an appeals court upheld a fraud conviction against Zhao Yan, a Chinese researcher for The New York Times, despite complaints from his defense team of having been prevented from presenting evidence and questioning witnesses. Mr. Zhao is serving a three-year sentence and is scheduled to be released next September.This year, Chinese lawyers are facing tighter scrutiny under recent regulations that require lawyers to submit to government supervision when they represent clients in politically charged cases like disputes over land seizures, evictions, pollution and other issues. A recent Human Rights Watch report warned that such regulations undermined the fairness of China’s legal system.'"
"'06-12-14,'1','People can turn their passions into a business at any age, and do. Matthew Lautar, 32, of College Park, Md., knew he wanted to be a tattoo artist from age 17, and is in the process of becoming his own boss. Two decades ago, Theresa Kant, 46, of Murfreesboro, Tenn., found that she loved calligraphy, and much later turned that interest into a going concern. Lorinda Knight, 65, did not use her 1963 art degree from Smith College until 10 years ago when she decided to open a contemporary arts gallery in Spokane, Wash.There is no precise information on how many pursue their passions, and even federal self-employment or small-business ownership data does not reveal whether passions or pragmatism are at work.But there are a few indicators. The 2004 Census Bureau data lists 923,144 people as being self-employed in the arts, entertainment and recreation. And an AARP study, also from 2004, found that 5.6 million people over age 50 were self-employed, although the study did not break down the areas in which they worked.A well-padded bank account or, at least, a pension can cushion the financial uncertainty that comes with pursuing one’s dreams — so many defer them to their later years. Then again, sometimes a true professional love arrives later in life, as in Ms. Marcic’s case.That happened when she researched a talk about equality between men and women for a 1999 conference, and realized the story of 20th-century women could be found in the era’s popular songs.She analyzed the Top 40 lists for each decade starting in 1900, tracing how women’s neediness and dependency in ballads like Tammy Wynette’s “Stand By Your Man,” evolved to more independence in songs like Helen Reddy’s “I Am Woman” and finally to women standing on their own, found in hits like Mariah Carey’s “Hero.”She landed a book contract to write about her findings, “Respect: Women and Popular Music,” and she combined the music and narrative as a one-woman show that she performed around the United States and elsewhere for several years.At first, she kept her day job, gradually going to part-time work before she quit. She loved the show, but she was losing money, she said. “I didn’t really know what I was doing,” she said. “My bank account went down every month for five years.”To recoup some of her losses, which she estimates at well over $100,000, she even thought about going back to teaching for a regular paycheck, but she said, “I wanted to be a playwright.” So she sought professional advice, then wrote a script for a four-woman musical, including herself in one of the roles, and put up $20,000 to attract a producer.Finally, in July of 2004, “Respect” went commercial with productions in Boston, Cleveland and Orlando. The Cleveland production closed, but the musical is expected to open in Detroit and Atlanta in coming months.Matthew Lautar’s route to his dream was a lot more direct. After drifting out of high school and into hard rock, skateboarding, graffiti and drugs, he became fascinated by tattoo artistry. At 17, intrigued with what he called making “fine art on skin,” he became an apprentice to a tattooist in Baltimore.“I wanted a career where I do something stimulating,” he said, “and where I could be my own boss.”In 1996, he worked for Great Southern Tattoo, in College Park, Md., then returned again in 2001 to work alongside the owners Charley and Sandy Parsons. He has put a down payment on the established business and is buying it on monthly installments. He said with more women coming in for tattoos, the practice has grown past its “thugs, criminals and bikers” image, and will continue to prosper.The part he loves best, he said, “is creating my own designs.” While there are plenty who request the standbys of hearts, butterflies and crosses, he said many people ask him to draw individual designs.“This is forever art,” he said, “and if I don’t do my job right, I’m going to have a customer who’s dissatisfied for the rest of his life.”Theresa Kant, now 46, was not a lot older than Mr. Lautar when she stumbled on something she loved. In 1986, she was a young divorced mother of two on a tight budget when she decided to remarry. To create her own invitations, she took a calligraphy course at a nearby community college and found “I had a talent for it.”She has kept her day job at a nearby auto plant, where she has worked for 24 years, but, she said, “my passion is calligraphy.”Four years ago, she set up her own Web site, sayitwithstyle.com, and now draws commissions from as far away as California.It is an art that she finds very calming — better than yoga, she said. “The movement of pen over the paper has to be smooth, and you can’t rush,” she said.She loves the people and her administrative tasks at her 9-to-5 job, and she said she probably could make a living from her calligraphy, but has no intention of quitting her day job anytime soon.“It’s almost like work is my social outlet, and calligraphy is my career,” she laughed.It took Lorinda Knight a lot longer to find her work passion. She loved her work as an interior designer in Spokane, but when she read in the local newspaper that a contemporary gallery was needed in the area, something clicked — at age 55.The gallery, in the downtown Davenport district, just had its 10th anniversary, but the road has not been easy, Ms. Knight said. Her first effort to bring in East Coast artists foundered because shipping expenses were prohibitive, so she turned to artists from the Northwest. Even so, business was slow to take off.“I think we were here for four years before anyone noticed,” she laughed. Even the space she rented, with red shag carpet and green and orange wallpaper, needed a major makeover.But she did not give up because, she said, “I get to be with this wonderful art; I love to install exhibits and advise clients.”Four years ago, she doubled her space to show paintings, drawings, sculpture, photography and ceramics from regional artists, dipping into her savings to finance the gallery.That passion is what binds people to such choices, even if they take years to become viable. Ms. Marcic, for example, said she was just now breaking even — seven years after she took a new career path.Asked what lessons she would take from teaching management and apply to theater, she said, “It’s a whole different world, but I learned that if you’re not a good manager, or don’t have one, in whatever you’re doing, you’re in a mess.”'"
"'06-12-14,'1','IN assisting Christopher Coleman at his Brooklyn design firm, Antonio Vieira, 33, generally has more space to work with than the 400 square feet afforded him by his Jersey City apartment. Mr. Vieira, who is from Venezuela, lives in the one-bedroom with his partner, Carlos Rivas, 31, and their tiger-striped tabby cat.The shortage of space did not deter the two in their ambitions when they moved in five years ago. After refinishing the floors and painting the walls, they moved on to more serious creative challenges presented by the lackluster pair of rooms.In the kitchen, they covered an uneven, crumbling plaster wall with white plastic place mats that cost 50 cents each. Mr. Vieira then spent two weeks painting the wall with yellow spirals, making it look like Op Art wallpaper and brightening up an otherwise unremarkable dining nook. They found nearly every piece of their furniture on the street, and Mr. Vieira often did the refinishing or reupholstering himself.“We have a lot of friends, and we always tell them, ‘If you see something on the street and you don’t want it and you think it’s beautiful, please take it and we will go to your apartment to pick it up,’ ” Mr. Vieira said.With its colorful vases, glass orbs and boldly graphic black and white throw pillows, the living room is reminiscent of Mr. Coleman’s style, which is notable for a strong rectilinear use of color that creates spaces that are minimalist but not cold. In Mr. Vieira’s version, though, materials and objects have been put to particularly unorthodox use: the wrapping paper from Moss in SoHo that has been framed as art, for example, and the mirror from Mr. Coleman’s line of children’s furniture that hangs in the dining area. (It sells for $1,950 but was given to Mr. Vieira by the designer.)Another unusual solution appears in the bedroom. When Mr. Rivas realized that a double bed would take too much space, he decided the couple should instead buy a $349 Ikea bunk bed, which they outfitted with grown-up accessories like coordinating red and white pillows that Mr. Vieira sewed himself.'"

"'06-12-14,'1','Key-chain thumb drives that pop into a computer’s U.S.B. port, carrying hundreds of documents, songs or pictures, are suddenly everywhere. Their convenience and shrinking price — some sell for less than $10 — have made them standard operating equipment for academics and businesspeople taking their homework home. But their small size and sheer ubiquity create a security hole big enough to drive a car through.That may be what inspired a recent experiment by engineers at Kingston Technology. One backed his Nissan 350Z over the company’s new Data Traveler Secure Privacy Edition to test its waterproof titanium case. It survived with the data intact, but needed a session with some pliers to mate it with a PC again.The three-inch-long device, priced from $53 to $297 in sizes from 512 megabytes to 4 gigabytes, will be available at major online retailers this week. The data inside is not just password-protected but also scrambled using high-strength 256-bit encryption.In a feature reminiscent of “Mission: Impossible,” an onboard 32-bit processor erases the drive if there are 10 consecutive failed attempts to log in. After the data has been destroyed, the unit can be reset and reused, but those secrets are gone.'"

"'06-12-15,'1','But resurgent inflation could still spoil the current trend of calm price increases, particularly if gas prices spike again or employers start passing on the cost of rising wages to consumers.“Don’t get too carried away,” said Ken Matheny, senior economist with Macroeconomic Advisers. “It’s welcome to the F.O.M.C. It makes them a little less concerned about having to tighten again. But I wouldn’t go too far. It doesn’t establish a new reality,” he added, referring to the Fed’s policy-setting arm, the Federal Open Markets Committee.The core inflation rate for the year still remains at 2.6 percent, well above what the Fed has said it considers healthy even as prices have steadied considerably since the summer.While the new figures suggest that the economy is gently gliding into a period when prices will be tame and growth neither too fast nor too slow, economists dispute just how orderly the decline in growth will be and how much prices will fall.On the one hand, the price deceleration has been broad-based. Just as the cost of gasoline was responsible for much of the run-up in prices earlier this year, falling fuel prices have brought down inflation. In addition, prices either fell or barely increased last month in most of the major categories that the government surveys for the consumer price index. Fruit and vegetable prices tumbled along with prices for airline tickets, automobiles and prescription drugs.The cost of housing, however, climbed notably last month, reflecting the higher cost of natural gas and other utilities.The price of oil, always a volatile economic force, is one of the wild cards on the horizon. In fact, OPEC said on Thursday that it planned to reduce its output quotas by 2 percent in February, a move intended to keep crude oil prices elevated next year. Oil prices closed up almost a dollar today at $63.43 a barrel.The other wild card is labor costs. Economists cautioned that rising wages could put pressure on businesses to raise prices in the months ahead.“People have been expressing a lot of relief over declining energy prices while seeming to neglect the rise in labor costs,” Richard F. Moody, chief with Mission Residential, a real estate investment firm. “Now with oil over $60 a barrel, it looks like it could be both energy costs and labor costs. I don’t think we’re out of the woods.”For the first time in four years, wages are significantly outpacing inflation. A separate Labor Department report today showed that while wage gains have slowed slightly in the last month, workers are still enjoying the strongest buying power in years. When adjusted for inflation, the average hourly wage of a worker in a position below management level rose 2.3 percent. November was the third consecutive month that wages rose at more than 2 percent when inflation is factored in, the first time that has happened in five years.'"
"'06-12-15,'1','The working groups established will encompass health care, aviation, energy and the environment, and will try to clarify regulatory processes in both country as well as remove obstacles to investments.China’s currency policy will continue to be discussed in existing groups, American and Chinese officials said. But the Americans noted that China had allowed the yuan to rise in value by 5.8 percent against the dollar in the last 18 months in what could be a response to American pressure.“We have seen some greater flexibility of late, and will continue to press for more in the future,” said a senior Treasury official said.The closing ceremony on Friday capped an unusual two-day dialogue behind closed doors on economic issues, promoted clashing visions of how quickly China should move to modernize its economic policies to resolve tensions with Washington.In marathon meetings at the Great Hall of the People, Mr. Paulson led an elaborate effort by the United States to persuade China to reform its policies. Though American officials argued that a faster pace of reform was in China’s interest, Chinese officials countered that their country must proceed at its own pace, given its history of poverty, colonial subjugation and civil wars, and that American officials must try harder to understand China’s constraints and achievements.The divergent perspectives were recounted during and after the daylong session by American officials who briefed reporters, but they were also reflected in the opposing statements of Mr. Paulson and his counterpart, Wu Yi, a vice prime minister, who gave a lengthy talk that was both defensive and defiant.Ms. Wu’s comments, accompanied by a PowerPoint presentation and pictures illustrating 5,000 years of Chinese history, were clearly directed not simply at her audience sitting across from the Chinese delegation but also at Congress, where anti-Chinese protectionist measures are being readied in case Mr. Paulson does not win concessions.“We have had the genuine feeling that some American friends are not only having limited knowledge of, but harboring much misunderstanding about the reality in China,” Ms. Wu said in her presentation, according to a text released by her government.“Our particular hope,” she added, “is to let people in the world know that China’s development is an opportunity instead of a threat to the world, that it is a propelling force behind the growth of the world economy.”Mr. Paulson’s keynote address called for “tangible results” from the strategic economic dialogue. His aides said he was talking about a timetable of two years, not this week.Ms. Wu said that China’s reforms were speeding faster than her listeners appreciated. Her colleagues cited a barrage of statistics, showing for example that spending by Chinese consumers was already transforming China into a country more reliant on domestic spending than exports for growth.“Reform and opening up are the most distinct characteristics of contemporary China,” she said, while emphasizing that China would maintain a “socialist market economy system” with government ownership its “mainstay.” There was no indication that she felt China needed to change that system faster than it was doing already.The issue of currency reform was cited several times, American officials said. Mr. Paulson opened the Thursday morning session by again urging that China let its currency float freely so that it could rise in value against the dollar, making Chinese exports more expensive for Americans to buy.In his comments, Mr. Bernanke said that letting the yuan float would be beneficial for China’s economic growth and for allowing its central bank a freer hand.He explained that to keep the value of Chinese currency low to promote exports, China has to buy dollars and flood the country with local currency. This would produce inflation, so China instead sells bonds and bills to Chinese to “sterilize” the economy from inflation brought on by an oversupply of money.It was a highly theoretical discussion from the Fed chief, delivered at a prestigious government-financed policy institute, the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. Because it was a sophisticated analysis of how markets work, it may have more of an impact on Chinese leaders than the preaching about capitalism they have heard from the Bush administration in the last two days.As if anticipating the American appeal, the yuan did rise against the dollar on Thursday, to 7.8197 yuan to the dollar, bringing its appreciation to well over 5 percent since mid-2005. Many economists say that if the yuan were to float freely in the markets, it would rise 20 percent or more.The United States contends that China has for years kept the yuan’s value artificially low by buying up the dollars earned by Chinese corporations and husbanding them as reserves. At present, China has an estimated $700 billion in dollar-denominated reserves.Several American officials said that the toughest talk on Thursday came from Susan C. Schwab, the United States trade representative, who went through a litany outlined in a report her office issued on Monday, saying that China was “backsliding” in its obligations to the World Trade Organization to open its economy.Ms. Schwab said the theme of her presentation was that the “Asian model” of state control of the economy and huge exports was no longer suitable for China, which now needs to focus on domestic consumption rather than exports to achieve economic growth.American officials said that thesis was disputed by Ma Kai, chairman of the National Development and Reform Commission of China, and others who argued that China’s model of mixing state control and free markets was more appropriate given the country’s volatile history.Economists say Chinese do not consume goods because they save a larger portion of their income than Americans.The Chinese had their own bill of particulars, American officials said. China contends that the United States unfairly accuses it of dumping low-cost exports into American markets, and it also wants the United States to lift a ban on sales of high-technology products to China.'"

"'06-12-15,'1','Mr. McCain spoke as the leader of a Congressional delegation that included five senators who have been strong backers of the war, among them Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, who won re-election in Connecticut last month as an independent after losing the Democratic nomination to an antiwar challenger. Mr. Lieberman, too, spoke strongly in favor of a substantial troop increase, saying, “A failed state in Iraq will be a disaster for the region and the world.”Two other Republican senators in the group, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and John Thune of South Dakota, said they also backed troop increases, but Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, said she had yet to make up her mind. “I for one am not yet convinced that additional troops will pave the way for a peaceful Iraq,” she said. “My fear is that if we have more troops sent to Iraq, we will just see more injuries and more deaths.”The trip amounted to a high-stakes campaign appearance by Mr. McCain, who is all but building his presidential campaign on the issue of Iraq. A leading contender for the Republican nomination in 2008, Mr. McCain strongly supported the original invasion but has shifted to criticizing the war’s execution. He now holds the politically risky position that the Bush administration should send in more troops, or withdraw entirely.But Mr. McCain said personal ambition would not guide his Iraq policy.“I take the position I’m taking with the full knowledge that only 15 to 18 percent of the American people agree with my position that we need more troops,” he said. Still, he said he supported the troop increase to stabilize the situation in Baghdad and other turbulent areas and give Iraqi leaders time to work out compromises to bring the Sunni insurgency and Sunni-Shiite sectarian violence under control.The visit by Mr. McCain came at a time of disarray in Washington and across the United States over how to proceed in Iraq. Mr. McCain, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, is effectively doubling down his bet on the war, figuring that embracing a strong resolution in Iraq will give him an effective campaign cudgel. If the administration sends more troops, Mr. McCain can hope for a speedy resolution in Iraq that allows him to claim partial victory; if President Bush pulls back and chaos persists, he could contend that his advice was ignored.Without a troop increase, Mr. McCain said at the news conference, “the results are going to be inevitable, in my view” — a defeat for America and for its Iraqi allies that would create a terrorist haven that could be used as a base for attacks in the United States.He contrasted the situation with the Vietnam War, saying, “when we came home, the war was over.” But now, he said, Iraq’s Islamic militants “will follow us home” if the American effort fails.Even Mr. McCain, a decorated Vietnam hero, acknowledged the perils of his approach. He described a troop increase as “the least bad option” and said it could cost him his shot at the presidency. “I happen to feel that I have to do what my many years of life involved in the military dictate to me,” he said. As if to emphasize his military credentials, he and other members of the delegation left Baghdad by helicopter after the news conference to fly to an embattled Marine base at Ramadi, 85 miles west of the capital, which is considered one of Iraq’s deadliest places.Although Mr. McCain did not say so, American commanders here are divided on the recommendations they will present to Mr. Bush, who has said he will announce a new strategy for the war in early January, officials familiar with the generals’ discussions say.General Casey, the top commander here, is said to be cautious, arguing that an increase could lower violence in Baghdad, at least temporarily, but that it could also encourage Iraq’s feuding political leaders to delay tough decisions needed to stem the slide toward anarchy.Lt. Gen. Peter W. Chiarelli, the second-highest-ranking American officer in Iraq, has been the allied forces’ operational commander for the past year, and he has resisted a troop increase, the officials say, believing an American-financed job creation program could do as much to weaken the insurgents and political militias.General Chiarelli’s successor, Lt. Gen. Raymond T. Odierno, who took over at a ceremony in Baghdad on Thursday, is bullish, seeing a troop increase as a way for American and Iraqi troops to gain the upper hand in Baghdad and Anbar Province, a desert region virtually overrun by Sunni insurgents, the officials say.Another cautionary voice has been that of Gen. John P. Abizaid, leader of the Central Command, which oversees the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. General Abizaid has said increasing troop strength, especially in Baghdad, could have an impact on the mounting cycle of revenge in which Sunni suicide bombings of Shiite civilian targets have set off murderous attacks on Sunni civilians by Shiite death squads. But General Abizaid, like General Casey, has said the impact would be temporary if Iraqi politicians failed to end sectarian feuding.Iraq’s growing anarchy was highlighted Thursday by another mass kidnapping in central Baghdad that appeared to have been driven by sectarian motives. Masked gunmen in elite police uniforms abducted dozens of men in the morning from the Sinak neighborhood, an area of automobile spare-parts shops close to the Shiite working-class district of Sadr City, an Interior Ministry official and witnesses said.The neighborhood is not far from the site of a suicide bombing on Tuesday in which at least 70 Shiite day laborers were killed and more than 230 wounded.The gunmen drove up in cars with police markings and brandished automatic rifles, witnesses said. “People were in a panic,” said a 36-year-old spare-parts merchant. “Some people were trying to close their shops and leave. Others were just trying to slip away. I walked away as fast as I could. A few seconds later, I heard heavy shooting.”Another merchant said he broke free from the gunmen before they could shove him into a car. “They seemed to know who they wanted to kidnap because they’d take one person and leave others behind,” he said.The men were blindfolded and driven off to a building in an unknown location, a Shiite man who was later freed said. He said the captives were shackled and kept in a poorly lighted room. The kidnappers asked the victims whether they were Sunni or Shiite, and whether they had ties to any terrorist groups.By late Thursday, at least 25 abductees had been freed, all Shiites, the Interior Ministry official said. It was unclear how many others — presumably Sunnis, though that was impossible to determine — were still being held.In the area of the predominantly Shiite city of Kut in southern Iraq, 17 bodies were found by a stream, police officials said. All the victims had been shot dead after being tortured.In Baghdad, a car bomb exploded near an Iraqi Army patrol, killing two people, including one soldier and mortar rounds killed a woman, according to Interior Ministry reports.'"
"'06-12-15,'1','The New York Times Company yesterday named James M. Follo, the former chief financial officer of Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia, as its chief financial officer.The appointment of Mr. Follo, who will also be a senior vice president, is effective Jan. 8. He will succeed Leonard P. Forman, who is retiring at the end of December.Mr. Follo “is a seasoned financial executive,” Janet L. Robinson, president and chief executive of the Times Company, said in a statement. “His extensive track record working with a wide range of media and in communicating with Wall Street will be extraordinarily valuable as we execute our multiplatform strategy.”Mr. Follo, 47, left Martha Stewart Living in March after serving in various capacities there since 1998. He is a certified public accountant.Before joining Martha Stewart Living, Mr. Follo held several positions at General Media International Inc., a diversified publishing company. Before that, he worked at Grant Thornton, an independent public accounting firm.In 2004, Mr. Follo testified in the criminal trial of Ms. Stewart as a government witness, taking the stand while the jury was out of the courtroom to relate how he had sometimes sparred with Ms. Stewart over her expenses.'"
"'06-12-15,'1','Prices of goods imported into the United States rose last month for the first time in three months because of an increase in the cost of natural gas purchases.Import prices rose 0.2 percent in November, after falling more than 2 percent in each of the two previous months, the Labor Department said yesterday. Excluding fuel, the index rose 0.1 percent.Separate figures from the Labor Department yesterday showed that initial jobless claims fell 20,000, to 304,000, last week, consistent with a healthy labor market. The four-week moving average, a less volatile measure, fell to 327,250, from 328,750.The absence of import price gains in other areas, coupled with the labor numbers, suggests that the Federal Reserve can continue to keep interest rates unchanged, economists said.The import price of natural gas soared 30.3 percent, the biggest increase since November 2004.The figures are “an energy story,” said Drew Matus, senior economist at Lehman Brothers Holdings in New York. “The consumer import prices were flat. We’re not really importing inflation from overseas.”While job growth is slowing along with the economy, companies are still reluctant to let people go, and the unemployment rate is near a five-year low. Claims have been skewed the last three weeks by seasonal adjustments that cause wide fluctuations at this time of year, according to the Labor Department.The import price index is the first of three monthly price gauges the government releases. The Labor Department is scheduled to issue its consumer price report today and its producer price report on Dec. 19. Both measures are projected to rise, according to preliminary estimates by economists.'"
"'06-12-15,'1','Soon afterward, the Connecticut attorney general and some high-ranking members of Congress took notice and serious regulation looked possible. That impulse appears to have been squelched by the November elections, which put Democrats in power, and by the rule.Before the new rule, hedge funds could raise money from 100 so-called accredited investors, those with a net worth of $1 million (including the value of the investor’s home) or two consecutive years of income of $200,000 (or $300,000 for a couple’s combined income). They could also raise money from an unlimited number of qualified buyers, those with investable assets of $5 million.Critics noted that the housing boom had made a lot of not-so-rich people accredited investors. So the S.E.C. proposed raising the standard to require investable assets of $2.5 million — assets in stocks or bonds or real estate, as long as the real estate served only investment purposes.The objective, staff members said, was to make sure that people investing in hedge funds had experience in the markets. In 1982, when the $1 million accredited investment standards were set, 1.87 percent of American households qualified. By 2006, 8.47 percent of American households could invest in hedge funds. With the new rule, only 1.3 percent of American households can join the party.Lawyers representing small hedge funds, as well as hedge funds that started small, at $5 million to $10 million, and got large ($500 million to $1 billion) challenged the rule, protesting that the brunt of the impact would be borne by small funds.“There is no viable argument that would support the notion that an investor with $2.5 million in investable assets is better suited to determine the quality of a hedge fund investment than an investor with a net worth of $1 million,” said Ron Geffner, a lawyer at Sadis & Goldberg who represents 400 hedge funds and funds of funds.So why did the agency change the rule?“The S.E.C. and politicians have been on a witch hunt for hedge fund managers for making too much money, for violating the law and not adding value to the economy when in reality, that is the exception and not the rule,” Mr. Geffner said.The rule has flaws. For one, venture capital funds are exempted because they provide capital to start-up companies, raising the question of how a start-up company differs from a start-up investment manager.“It’s demoralizing to employees to tell them they cannot invest with the people they work with and know best,” said Paul Roth of the Schulte Roth & Zabel law firm.Most hedge funds have a minimum investment requirement of $1 million, making the accredited investor definition seem redundant. (If you only have $1 million in the form of your house, you won’t have the additional $1 million to get into the fund.)The rule coincides with waning enthusiasm for regulating hedge funds.“I’m not envisioning, legislatively, running back to that,” Senator Christopher J. Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut, said about hedge fund regulation during a news conference. Mr. Dodd has been preparing to take over the leadership of the Senate Banking Committee. “Again, I’d rather listen to people who are out there talking about what needs to be done,” he said.His Democratic counterpart in the House, Barney Frank of Massachusetts, who proposed legislation this year to authorize the S.E.C. to reinstate the registration rule after the courts dismissed it, seems to have changed his tune.“Not legislating, no,” he was quoted by the San Francisco Chronicle. “What we need to do is have hearings on hedge funds.”During which the S.E.C. will say, “only for the very, very rich.”'"
"'06-12-15,'1','The Democratic proposal, which would apply to the House only, does not go as far as the commission recommended, but one member of the panel welcomed it on Thursday as a substantive step.“I think it is a creative, bold solution,” said Timothy J. Roemer, a former Democratic congressman who served on the panel and consulted with lawmakers on the new committee. “You can’t point to the F.B.I. to clean up its culture and ask the C.I.A. to improve human intelligence without cleaning up your own backyard.”In another major break with House practice, Ms. Pelosi also formally announced that Democrats, with Republican cooperation, would form a task force to study ways the House could establish an independent entity to enforce House ethics rules.“There’s no question that the ethics process in the past couple of years has lost the confidence of the American people,” said Ms. Pelosi, referring to a string of corruption cases that drew little response from the internal ethics panel, which has members from both parties.Earlier this week, the leadership also announced that it would not try to complete a series of spending bills left on the table by Republicans. This would result in the unusual stalling of thousands of pet projects sought by lawmakers.The new intelligence committee would be established through proposed changes in House rules to be presented to lawmakers when the 110th Congress convenes on Jan. 4. Under the Democratic proposal, it would consist of members of the Intelligence Committee as well as the Appropriations Committee and make recommendations to the full Appropriations Committee.Advocates of the approach say it should provide some “cross-pollination” that will lead to lawmakers’ gaining more expertise and depth of knowledge about intelligence activities, giving them a greater ability to monitor operations and suggest changes.Ms. Pelosi said the plan “removes the barriers between the House appropriators and authorizers, makes the oversight stronger.”“What we are doing, I think, is quite remarkable and new,” she said.Representative John A. Boehner of Ohio, the Republican leader, was noncommittal about the intelligence plan. He said he would “take a look at her proposal and confer with my colleagues about it.”The proposal would have to be approved by the entire House. Democrats, if they are united on the plan, would be able to override even unanimous opposition from Republicans in the new Congress.Mr. Boehner took the opportunity to take a jab at Ms. Pelosi, accusing her of backtracking on a high-profile campaign pledge to adopt all of the remaining recommendations of the commission that Republicans resisted. The commission, for instance, had proposed a new joint House-Senate intelligence panel.But Ms. Pelosi said it would not be possible to follow all the ideas suggested and indicated that Democrats, after pushing through the new internal rules, would immediately turn to other commission recommendations.“We’ll go them one better on port security, where we have even tougher proposals to screen 100 percent of the containers long before they reach U.S. shores,” she said.Senate Democrats have been less enthusiastic about making such changes, but the House action could step up pressure for a new approach to intelligence matters across the Rotunda as well. Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the Democratic leader, said last week that he would consult committee chairmen to see what recommendations could be enacted.On the ethics task force, Democrats said its findings on an independent watchdog would be due March 15. Ms. Pelosi said the group should determine how such an enforcement arm might work.'"
"'06-12-15,'1','LONDON, Dec. 14 — The EMI Group, the British music company, still stands alone.EMI confirmed on Thursday what some analysts and investors had been speculating for several days — a hoped-for takeover by a private equity investor was dead in the water.“The EMI board has not received an offer that fully reflects the prospects for and value of the company and which it could recommend to shareholders,” EMI said in a statement. EMI said on Nov. 28 that it had received a “preliminary approach.” The bidder was not identified, but advisers in London said it was the Permira Group, a private equity company.EMI was looking for at least 320 pence a share for the company, which would have valued it above £2.5 billion ($4.9 billion), or what Warner Music bid for EMI in June, said one executive who declined to be identified because he was not authorized to speak publicly about the matter. But Permira “just couldn’t get there” based on projections of the company’s cash flows and other financial information, he said.Shares of EMI fell 10.74 percent, to close at 268 pence on the London Stock Exchange, their biggest one-day drop since February 2005.EMI also said Thursday that it planned to buy out Toshiba’s share of their Japanese joint venture, Toshiba-EMI. EMI is buying Toshiba’s 45 percent stake for 21 billion yen ($178 million.) Revenue at the joint venture has fallen for several years, as Japanese customers, like those in many markets worldwide, increasingly get their music electronically.EMI has tried several times to merge with other music companies, but discussions always collapsed before a deal was struck, over either price or management structure. This past summer, EMI and Warner made bids for each other.'"

"'06-12-15,'1','Seventeen oil companies and gasoline service stations have been named in a class-action suit accusing them of overcharging customers at the pump by failing to compensate for changes in gasoline volumes when temperatures rise.The consumer fraud suit contends that oil companies fail to take into account the fact that gasoline expands when the temperature exceeds 60 degrees. Therefore, the suit says, consumers get less energy for each gallon they buy.The suit was filed Wednesday by a small number of truck drivers and motorists in California.According to Public Citizen, a consumer association, the oil industry has resisted installing equipment that can adjust gasoline volumes delivered at the pump when temperatures change. While the difference amounts to pennies per gallon, Public Citizen estimates that oil companies end up overcharging consumers by more than $2 billion each year.The American Petroleum Institute, the oil industry’s largest trade group, has said that changing the existing metering systems would be too costly while benefits to consumers would be small.The companies named in the suit include Chevron, 7-Eleven, Valero and Wal-Mart Stores.'"
"'06-12-15,'1','WHITE PLAINS, Dec. 15 (AP) — A founder of the collapsed hedge fund the Bayou Group admitted Thursday in federal court that he had conspired to defraud investors of more than $10 million, federal prosecutors said.A United States attorney, Michael Garcia, said the co-founder of the fund, James C. Marquez, had pleaded guilty to conspiracy to defraud and could be sentenced to up to five years in prison.Last year, two top officers of the funds, Samuel Israel III and Daniel Marino, pleaded guilty to conspiracy and fraud charges in connection with the Bayou scandal, which the government says cost investors as much as $450 million. They await sentencing.Mr. Marquez admitted that from 1996 to 2001, the three men lured investors into the Bayou fund by creating false financial statements that said the fund was making big profits when it was actually losing money, Mr. Garcia said.A telephone call to Mr. Marquez’s lawyer, Stanley A. Twardy, was not immediately returned Thursday.'"
"'06-12-15,'1','MIAMI, Dec. 14 — A convicted murderer was put to death by lethal injection on Wednesday, but he took more than a half-hour to die and required a second dose of the chemicals, prompting Gov. Jeb Bush to call for a review of the execution.The convict, Angel N. Diaz, 55, was pronounced dead at 6:36 p.m., 34 minutes after receiving the first lethal injection at the Florida State Prison in Starke, 23 miles northeast of Gainesville. Normally, death occurs within 15 minutes.Witnesses said Mr. Diaz appeared to be moving after the first injection was administered, seemingly squinting and grimacing, at times appearing to mouth words.On Thursday, James R. McDonough, secretary of the state’s Department of Corrections, asked for an expedited autopsy and appointed a team of law enforcement and medical professionals to investigate the execution, at the request of Governor Bush.“I think it’s appropriate to do so, given the unusual length of time it took for the process to complete,” Mr. Bush told reporters. “I’m concerned enough to ask Secretary McDonough to put together a team to review it thoroughly and quickly, but I don’t know if anything was done outside of the protocol.”'"
"'06-12-15,'1','Several Hamas officials have ferried huge sums of cash into Gaza since the group came to power early this year, saying the money was desperately needed to pay government salaries after the cutoff of Western assistance.The chaotic scenes along the border encapsulated the multiple crises facing the Palestinians: the continuing conflict with Israel, the Palestinians’ internecine battles and their worsening financial plight.Ghazi Hamad, a spokesman for the Hamas government who was traveling with Mr. Haniya, said in a telephone interview that he and other Hamas officials had the money in El Arish, Egypt, about 30 miles from the border. He declined to give the amount.Other Palestinian officials said the money would be handed over to the Arab League in Cairo until a way could be found to get it to the Palestinian areas.The Palestinians did not say where Mr. Haniya had obtained the money, though speculation focused on Iran. Mr. Haniya spent more than two weeks traveling in the Middle East, including a stop in Iran, which pledged $250 million to the Palestinian government.The Palestinians have not placed any restrictions on the amount of cash that can be brought through Rafah as long as the money is declared at the border.However, a senior Israeli security official said Israel acted because “we have reason to believe the money will be used to strengthen Hamas and will be used for terror.” The official did not provide additional details or say how Israel knew that Mr. Haniya was trying to bring money into Gaza.With internal Palestinian tensions escalating in the Gaza Strip, Mr. Haniya cut short his extended tour of the Middle East. He flew from Sudan to Egypt, and began heading overland Thursday afternoon toward the Gaza border. But before he arrived, Israel’s defense minister, Amir Peretz, ordered the crossing closed.Israel has no troops in Gaza, but it does have forces in southern Israel, just a few miles away from the Rafah crossing, and they could move into Gaza quickly if its order was defied.Egypt closed its side of the border, and the Palestinian side shut down when the clashes erupted between the Hamas gunmen and the Palestinian security forces, who are loyal to the Palestinian Authority president, Mahmoud Abbas, from the rival Fatah movement.Israel and Western countries cut the flow of money to the Palestinian government after Hamas came to power in March. The Hamas government has been able to pay salaries only partly and sporadically.The Palestinian Authority needs more than $150 million a month for salaries and other basic expenses, and Hamas officials have sought to bring in at least a portion of that amount on their trips abroad.When the Palestinians took control of the Rafah border crossing in November 2005, it allowed Palestinians in Gaza to travel to Egypt and on to the wider world without having to go through Israeli security.Thursday’s episode demonstrated Israel’s ability to shut down the border even when its security forces are not present.Elsewhere in Gaza, Palestinian internal tensions were still running high. The Palestinian security forces arrested a suspect in the killing of three young sons of a Palestinian security official who were gunned down on Monday as they were being driven to school.The suspect, Hisham Mkhaimar, belongs to the Popular Resistance Committees, and his arrest ignited a gun battle between the security forces and members of his faction. Shortly afterward, the Popular Resistance Committees kidnapped a member of the security forces and said he would not be released until Mr. Mkhaimar was freed.In the West Bank, Israeli troops shot dead two Palestinian militants in one confrontation, and killed another Palestinian man in clashes with stone throwers, the military and Palestinian witnesses said.In Israel, the High Court of Justice addressed one of the most contentious issues in the past six years of violence between Israel and the Palestinians. It ruled that Israel’s targeted killings of Palestinian militants were legitimate in some circumstances.But the court said Israel’s military must exhaust other options first, like trying to arrest suspects, and must take into account the possibility of harming innocent civilians.'"
"'06-12-15,'1','BRUSSELS, Dec. 14 — The evening newscast on state television on Wednesday opened with fuzzy pictures of what appeared to be King Albert II and Queen Paola fleeing the country on a military plane as a clutch of pro-monarchy demonstrators waved Belgian flags outside the royal palace. Then there was video of trucks blocked at the new border.Flanders, the report declared, had proclaimed its independence. Belgium, a fragile federal country of 10 million people, famous for its 300 kinds of beer, its funky designers and its more than a dozen different parliaments and regional governments, was no more. But was it?The broadcast, on the French-language channel RTBF, rocked the nation. It prompted a headline in the Thursday issue of the daily Le Soir to proclaim that “Belgium Died Last Night.” But it turned out to be a hoax. And on Thursday the country, divided as it is between Flemish-speaking Flanders in the north and French-speaking Wallonia in the south, was reeling.“It’s very bad Orson Welles, in very poor taste,” Didier Seeuws, a spokesman for Prime Minister Guy Verhofstadt, told the national news agency Belga, recalling the 1938 radio adaptation of H. G. Wells’s “War of the Worlds,” which caused widespread panic when thousands of Americans believed that Martians had invaded New Jersey.As the broadcast here continued with live interviews of politicians reacting to the Flemish declaration, RTBF displayed a message at the bottom of the screen: “This is perhaps not a fiction.” The warning was an oblique reference to “This Is Not a Pipe,” the title of a painting by the Belgian Surrealist master René Magritte.'"
"'06-12-15,'1','It won’t win any awards for avant-garde documentary-making, but “Heart & Soul: The Life and Music of Frank Loesser” does its job well.After watching these 90 minutes (Sunday on many PBS stations), sentient viewers will know a lot about Loesser’s career and just enough about his life. Even if that weren’t true, the show would be worth watching just to see and hear star performances of Loesser’s trove of unforgettable Broadway and Hollywood songs.In the beginning, the film insults musical theater fans a bit by suggesting that Loesser is unknown. He may not have the posthumous presence of Cole Porter or the Gershwins, but Loesser (rhymes with dresser, as his fans know), 37 years after his death, is hardly forgotten.Some of his admirers, however, may not know just how much he contributed to 20th-century popular music. First and foremost, there is “Guys and Dolls,” which opened on Broadway in 1950 and was made into a 1955 film with Frank Sinatra and Marlon Brando. The composer’s daughter Emily says on camera that “Guys and Dolls” is “known as the perfect musical.”The documentary makes a convincing argument for that claim. There are generous and thoroughly enjoyable excerpts from screen performances of the show’s best-known songs, including “Sit Down, You’re Rockin’ the Boat,” “I’ll Know,” “Fugue for Tinhorns” (“I’ve got the horse right here”) and “Adelaide’s Lament” (“A person can develop a cold”).'"
"'06-12-15,'1','There are no ergs in “Historical Atlas of the United States,” but a 1550 map made in Dieppe, France, manages to push the St. Lawrence River halfway to Florida and sprinkle a few unicorns and tigers along the route. Derek Hayes, the author of several other books on historical maps, works his way from the discovery and settlement of North America to the ever-evolving maps recording America’s westward push and onward to the early maps of the automobile age. Among many oddities is a Soviet map of the Eastern Seaboard intended to help nuclear missiles hit the right spot.In this season of peace, there happen to be some terrific war books on the shelves. “Fighting Techniques of the Ancient World” and “Fighting Techniques of the Early Modern World” combine solid historical essays on topics like naval warfare in the ancient world, or the role of infantry in early modern times, with ingenious color illustrations of key battles. Anyone who has wondered what exactly went on at the battle of Cannae, every commander’s ideal of total victory, can see it unfold here, as little color-coded Roman legions and cavalry square off against Hannibal’s army of Celts, Spaniards and Numidians. The early-modern volume includes the battle of Blenheim, the siege of Quebec, the naval battle of Lepanto and many others. The comprehensive, busily illustrated “Battle” covers 5,000 years of combat in one volume, from the Old Kingdom of Egypt to recent conflicts in the Balkans and Chechnya. Although written for adults, these books would have thrilled me starting at about the age of 9.Three nature books also appeal to all ages. The Encyclopedia of Animals, packed with photographs and color illustrations, begins with a handy user’s guide, then plunges right into the wonderful world of mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, fishes and invertebrates, in that order. Each family comes with a “fact file,” a series of compact profiles of the specific individuals illustrated. The chapter on deer includes fact blocks on, among others, the lesser Malay chevrotain (“the smallest of all even-toed ungulates, this animal has legs about as thick as a pencil”), the chital and the giant muntjak, with icons indicating height, weight, social unit, habitat and conservation status (extinct, endangered, common and so on).“Birds of the World” rests on a simple, indisputable premise: “Birds are beautiful animals and many people enjoy watching them.” Les Beletsky, an ornithologist, makes this point in the first sentence of his preface and honors it in the ensuing 500 or so pages, which contain 1,600 original illustrations describing more than 200 families and 1,300 species in a field-guide format. In another book, “Bird Songs,” Mr. Beletsky solves the nagging problem encountered by anyone trying to imagine what per-WHEET-WHEET actually sounds like. The book, which describes 250 North American birds, comes with an electronic plastic attachment that allows readers to play the song of the bird they are reading about. Vultures sound creepy.A good coffee-table book balances brains with sex appeal. Eye-popping pictures are not enough. “Perfume,” at first glance, looks like a bimbo but turns out to be a well-researched history of the subject, with wonderful historical illustrations from art and advertising. Richard Stamelman, a professor of romance languages and comparative literature at Williams College (and an honorary member of the Société Française des Parfumeurs), adopts the right tone, recognizing perfume as one of life’s harmless pleasures while carefully documenting its history, and its alluring presence in the works of Baudelaire, Colette and of course Patrick Süskind, the author of the novel “Perfume.”Those who find that gilt-edged bonds, rather than opium, get the pulse racing will appreciate “The Origins of Value,” a serious collection of essays on subjects like the invention of interest, Roman shares, futures trading in 17th-century Amsterdam and the origins of the New York Stock Exchange. This may sound like a book that only Scrooge could love, but it comes with copious illustrations of, for example, early Chinese paper money and banking documents from Renaissance Florence. Be sure to read aloud the chapter on perpetuities, as the children listen in rapt attention.Language books are always welcome. More steadily than blue chips, they throw off dividends throughout the year. “The Yale Book of Quotations,” handsomely printed, brings modern voices into the company of standbys like Shakespeare, Samuel Johnson and Mark Twain, who squeeze together and make room for B. B. King (“Nobody loves me but my mother — and she could be jivin’, too”), Fran Lebowitz (“Sleep is death without the responsibility”) and Stanislaw Jerzy Lec (“No snowflake in an avalanche ever feels responsible”).In “The New Oxford Book of Literary Anecdotes,” John Gross, a former book critic of The New York Times, updates with distinction a book that has always been good for endless hours of random reading. Open at any page, at any time. You will be rewarded in unexpected ways, by unexpected writers.The new paperback edition of “Mind the Gaffe,” by the American linguist R. L. Trask, efficiently untangles problems of style and usage, while administering justice with a strong hand. Mr. Trask, who died in 2004, takes on academic jargon, fad words and other forms of stupidity with a flaming sword. One example: “Do not write drivel like Galliano is at the epicenter of women’s fashion: all this means is ‘Galliano is important in women’s fashion, and I am a pretentious twit.’ ”Two books of no redeeming value whatsoever must be recommended. “The Dog Dialed 911” gathers together a generous assortment of official documents and strange artifacts, most connected to unfortunate encounters with law enforcement. These include celebrity mug shots (say cheese, Nick Nolte!), bad bank-robbery notes and name-change applications filed by citizens like the unfortunate William Gerard Doody.The utterly mindless “Pop-Up Book of Celebrity Meltdowns” lets readers interact, in a hands-on way, with critical moments in recent history. These include Tom Cruise’s manic appearance on “Oprah” (pull the tab and make Tom jump up and down on the couch), and the O. J. Simpson car chase (pull tab very slowly to ensure verisimilitude).Onward to the stocking stuffers. The best personals ads in The London Review of Books have been selected for “They Call Me Naughty Lola.” The British do not go in for the cheery, self-affirming personals favored by Americans. Their style is more like this: “Shy, ugly man, fond of extended periods of self-pity, middle-aged, flatulent and overweight, seeks the impossible.” The Penguin Great Ideas series, whose volumes usually consist of just a few shorter essays or a long one wrapped in a spiffy embossed cover, fit nicely into a back pocket. “On the Pleasure of Hating,” by William Hazlitt, might be a little off-message for this joyous time of year, but there’s one title that fits beautifully: “Conspicuous Consumption,” by Thorstein Veblen.Finally, Stanley Weintraub’s “11 Days in December.” It’s not a warmhearted holiday story. It’s a compact history of the Battle of the Bulge, and it serves as a useful reminder that no matter how tough your holiday season might be, Christmas really can be a whole lot worse.Roam the Streets of Venice or Explore the Evolution of Times SquareHere is information about the books mentioned:BIRDS OF THE WORLD by Les Beletsky (Johns Hopkins University Press); 513 pages; $50THE DOG DIALED 911 by William Bastone, Andrew Goldberg, Daniel Green and Joseph Jesselli (Little, Brown); 216 pages; paperback, $15.99THE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF ANIMALS, consultants, Fred Cooke, Hugh Dingle, Stephen Hutchinson, George McKay, Richard Schodde, Noel Tait and Richard Vogt (University of California Press); 608 pages; $39.95FIGHTING TECHNIQUES OF THE ANCIENT WORLD by Simon Anglim, Phyllis G.

"'06-12-15,'1','In 1997, my wife, Anne, and I were shopping for land, and this property had 75 acres. We saw the barn as a negative and figured we’d have it burned down. But the more we looked at it, the more we liked its old beams and simple lines. I took pictures of it to the Farmers’ Museum in Cooperstown and they told me it was a German post-and-beam barn that had been built in the 1850s from a kit. The pieces of the barn had been floated on a barge up the Hudson. At that point, I knew we had to save it, so we decided to make it our house.My brother-in-law, Robert Thornton, has a construction business on Long Island, where we live. He came up here with 17 other people, mostly friends and family, and got to work. It reminded me of an old-fashioned barn raising. From there, though, it made the transition from barn to house very slowly. The men of the family would come up on weekends to work. At first, we’d sleep at a motel, but eventually we’d sleep at the barn using tarps and boards to keep the heat in. It was years before our wives were willing to stay with us. They’d go to a B & B.But now there’s a 24-foot stone fireplace built from stones we carried in by ourselves from our woods. There are 2½-inch thick hemlock floors, which are replicas of the original floors, which we had cut at a local sawmill and let dry for two years. There are arched windows with meadow views and a porch where Anne and I love to have tea in the mornings. The conversion took nearly eight years, but it’s beautiful. It’s been a true labor of love.'"

The decision by the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services came one day after Attorney General Jay Nixon sued the company, Joplin River of Life Ministries Inc., seeking millions of dollars in damages. In both cases, officials asserted that the business was illegally operated by Robert DuPont, left, who had been barred from running long-term-care facilities and participating in the Medicaid program because of a 2003 federal sentence in a Medicare and Medicaid fraud scheme. The cause of the fire, at River of Life’s Anderson Guest House, has not been determined, but investigators have said improper wiring may have been to blame.'"
"'06-12-16,'0','The corrections secretary said the state would create a commission to review sentencing guidelines, a potential crucial step in Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger’s efforts to relieve prison crowding. Changes could give judges and parole officers greater discretion and lead to some offenders being released sooner than under current law, the secretary, James E. Tilton, told The Associated Press. The proposal comes five days after a federal judge gave Mr. Schwarzenegger a June deadline to ease crowding in the state prison system, the nation’s largest, where more than 173,000 inmates live in space designed for fewer than 100,000. Failure to do so could lead the federal courts to order remedies that include early release of inmates.'"
"'06-12-16,'0','NAIROBI, Kenya, Dec. 15 — More than a dozen people have been killed and thousands of goats, camels, donkeys and cows stolen in a brazen cattle raid in northern Kenya, police officials said Friday.Livestock rustling is a deadly problem across East Africa, especially in loosely patrolled border areas, and a recent bout of severe drought and heavy rain has cut into available grazing land, exacerbating tensions among ethnic groups competing for survival.Rarely, though, has there been a raid like this, according to Kenyan police officials. Hundreds of armed warriors from the West Pokot district in northern Kenya stormed into the village of Lorengipi at dawn on Wednesday. The raiders split into two groups, the police said, with one focused on the terrified villagers while the other rounded up the livestock.Among many of Africa’s pastoralists, stealing livestock is seen as a badge of honor — and losing the animals is considered disgraceful. Raiders used to be armed with spears, but now they carry machine guns, which is why more and more people have been killed recently. On Wednesday, villagers tried to resist the raiders, setting off a gun battle that resembled a miniwar, with hundreds of participants.After killing more than a dozen villagers, the raiders made off with 3,500 camels, 1,700 head of cattle, 700 donkeys and 1,800 goats, according to local news reports. Because the area is so remote, about 200 miles northwest of Nairobi, with little electricity or mobile-phone service, the authorities were not able to respond for hours. Mr. Kibunjah said Friday that information was still coming in from the field and that only six bodies had been recovered, though villagers said 15 to 20 people were killed, with an additional 20 wounded.On Friday, Kenyan soldiers, backed by helicopters, were following a huge number of animal tracks leading west, toward Uganda.Last summer, more than 70 people were killed in a similar raid on the Kenyan-Ethiopian border. Aid organizations have tried to broker truces between warring tribes, and even Kenyan celebrities like Tegla Loroupe, a world-class marathon runner, have spent their own money on peace programs.'"
"'06-12-16,'0','Many have children or spouses who are legal residents or Americans, and they have to decide whether the families will stay here or return to their home countries.Veronica Rodriguez Perez, 20, an American who is works on a production line at the Swift beef-processing plant in Greeley, Colo., said she had not been able to talk with her husband, a Guatemalan, since he was arrested on Tuesday. Mrs. Perez said immigration agents separated during the raid from her husband, Roberto Pérez García.“They made him and myself seem like criminals,” she said. “He tried to give me a kiss on the forehead, but they would not let us talk to each other.”Mr. Pérez worked in the slaughterhouse side of the plant, she said. They have an 11-month-old son who was born in Colorado. Mr. Pérez, who was in the United States illegally, had not applied for residency because of the legal costs, she said.Many of the arrested immigrants were taken to Camp Dodge in Johnston, Iowa, a National Guard base. Others were bussed to an immigration detention center in Atlanta for deportation proceedings.The chief executive officer of Swift, Sam Rovit, said that production was slightly slowed at the plants, but that the losses in replacing the workers could be in the millions.Swift executives said they had sought to work with immigration officials to pre-empt the raids. In March, the immigration agency subpoenaed the work documents of every Swift employee. After reviewing the papers, the agency retained them for many employees, including 665 at a plant in Marshalltown, Iowa, on suspicion that they were fake or stolen, Donald F. Wiseman, the Swift general counsel, said.Swift began to interview its employees. About 400 left the company after the interviews, with many acknowledging that their documents were not legal, Mr. Wiseman said. He added that the immigration agency later ordered the company to stop the interviews.On Nov. 28, Swift sought an injunction against the raids in Federal court in Amarillo, Tex. Judge Mary Lou Robinson denied the request.Mr. Rovit said Swift, third largest meatpacker in the nation, paid good wages by industry standards, twice the minimum wage, with health benefits. With tight profit margins, he added, Swift would be hard-pressed to replace the workers for work, which is demanding and has historically attracted immigrants, including immigrants without proper documents.“Nobody wants to have illegal immigrants,” Mr. Rovit said.He said a continued crackdown would bring “a shrinking in the industry, because there is not enough labor to go around.”Prosecutors in several states began filing criminal charges against accused suppliers of the illegal documents. In Salt Lake City, officials unsealed a complaint against Veronica Carrillo, a Mexican immigrant accused of selling real United States birth certificates to Swift employees.'"
"'06-12-16,'0','“The inflation scare of 2006 is over,” Kenneth Beauchemin, a United States economist with Global Insight, said in a research note. “Much credit belongs to the Fed.”Stagnant prices combined with stunted economic growth make it less likely that the Fed will increase interest rates early next year.Wall Street also appeared to think so, and investors propelled shares to new highs yesterday. The Dow Jones industrial average closed at a record level, and the benchmark Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index closed at a six-year high.Resurgent inflation could still spoil the trend of calm price increases, particularly if gas prices spike or employers start passing on the cost of rising wages to consumers.“Don’t get too carried away,” said Ken Matheny, senior economist with Macroeconomic Advisers.He said the news should ease the Fed’s concerns. “But I wouldn’t go too far,” he added. “It doesn’t establish a new reality.”Though prices have steadied since the summer, the core inflation rate for the year remains at 2.6 percent, well above the 2 percent that the Fed has said it considers healthy.While yesterday’s figures suggest that the economy is gently gliding into a period when prices will be tame and growth steady, economists dispute just how orderly the decline in growth will be and how much prices will fall.On the one hand, the price deceleration has been broad-based. Just as the cost of gasoline was responsible for much of the run-up in prices earlier this year, falling fuel prices have brought down inflation. In addition, prices either fell or barely increased last month in most of the major categories that the government surveys for the consumer price index. Fruit and vegetable prices tumbled along with prices for airline tickets, automobiles and prescription drugs.But the cost of housing climbed last month, reflecting the higher cost of natural gas and other utilities.The price of oil, always a volatile economic force, is one of the wild cards. In fact, OPEC said Thursday that it planned to reduce its output quotas by 2 percent in February, a move intended to keep crude oil prices elevated next year. Oil prices closed up almost a dollar yesterday at $63.43 a barrel.The other wild card is labor costs. Economists cautioned that rising wages could pressure businesses to raise prices in the months ahead.“People have been expressing a lot of relief over declining energy prices while seeming to neglect the rise in labor costs,” Richard F. Moody, chief economist with Mission Residential, a real estate investment firm. “Now with oil over $60 a barrel, it looks like it could be both energy costs and labor costs.”For the first time in four years, wages are significantly outpacing inflation. A separate Labor Department report yesterday showed that while wage gains have slowed slightly in the last month, workers are still enjoying the strongest buying power in years. When adjusted for inflation, the average hourly wage of a worker in a position below management level rose 2.3 percent. November was the third consecutive month that wages rose at more than 2 percent when inflation is factored in, the first time that has happened in five years.Not all economists are convinced, however, that the recent rise in wages threatens to push inflation back up. Jared Bernstein, an economist at the Economic Policy Institute, said when inflation was not taken into account, wages had increased about the same year-over-year rate since this summer.“Inflation hawks are always going to look to the phantom menace of labor costs,” he said. “What real wage growth we’ve achieved has come from slower price growth. And that’s been a long time in coming. Don’t stop the party just when the working class gets there.”'"
"'06-12-16,'0','If one big domestic merger goes through, other airlines will feel pressure to pair off, too, or risk winding up at a competitive disadvantage because they have higher costs or smaller route networks. While such consolidation may bolster airlines’ bottom lines, reduced competition would probably also result in more-crowded flights and higher fares, at least in the short term.Delta, which opposes US Airways’ bid, will file a plan next week outlining how it intends to operate as an independent airline once out of bankruptcy court protection.EASING THE RULES Federal regulators and prosecutors moved to narrow or roll back some rules and investigative methods adopted after Enron and WorldCom imploded in multibillion-dollar accounting frauds, starting a wave of corporate scandals that are still unfolding.The Justice Department acted first, imposing new limits on prosecutors in white-collar corruption cases. They now must seek approval from senior officials before asking companies to waive their attorney-client privilege, and they must disregard if a company has hired lawyers for potential witnesses when deciding whether to charge the company.A day later, the Securities and Exchange Commission moved to relax an auditing provision of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 for smaller companies. In the law, Congress left it to the S.E.C. to decide precisely how thoroughly auditors must review the financial controls companies employ to detect fraud in their accounts.The United States Chamber of Commerce and other business groups that have been critical of the S.E.C. rules and the Justice Department’s approach may still try to persuade Congress to further reduce regulations and enforcement.HOLDING STEADY The Federal Reserve left its benchmark interest rate steady, holding firm to its position that a slowing economy will subdue inflation in the months ahead but warning in a statement that “some inflation risks remain.”The possibility that inflation will not slow as expected has worried Fed board members, particularly Jeffrey M. Lacker of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, who has dissented each time since the central bank stopped raising rates in August.While the Fed’s Open Market Committee indicated in its statement that another rate increase could soon be needed to hold price increases down, it also acknowledged that “recent indicators have been mixed” and it could not rule out the possibility that economic growth and inflation could slow enough to warrant a rate cut next spring.One barometer of inflation, the Labor Department’s producer price index, will be updated Tuesday with figures from November.BIDDING WAR Rival steel makers from India and Brazil opened a bidding war for the British-Dutch producer Corus, accelerating a worldwide consolidation of steel companies amid sharply higher costs for raw materials and energy.Tata Steel of India began the scrap by offering $9.2 billion in cash for Corus, which itself was created by the 1999 merger of British Steel and Royal Hoogovens of the Netherlands. Within hours of Tata’s bid, however, the Brazilian company, Companhia Siderúrgica Nacional, offered $9.6 billion.Both bidders have access to cheap iron ore, a crucial matter in a global market where ore prices have risen in consecutive years. Tata also has the advantage of India’s booming appetite for steel among road builders, land developers and automakers.If either bid succeeds, the deal would be the second largest in 2006, trailing only Mittal Steel’s $38.3 billion takeover of the Spanish-French-Luxembourgian steel maker Arcelor last summer.UNHAPPY ANNIVERSARY On the eve of a high-level visit by American officials, the Bush administration accused China of failing to honor promises to open its economy to foreign competition and crack down on piracy of foreign goods.The criticism came in a report to Congress by Susan C. Schwab, the United States trade representative. The analysis, which praised China in some areas, was required by American law on the fifth anniversary of China’s joining the World Trade Organization.The United States may seek arbitration from the World Trade Organization if it cannot resolve its disputes with China.GOLDEN GOLDMAN The investment bank Goldman Sachs said its profit soared 93 percent in its fiscal fourth quarter, meaning it earned nearly as much in 2006 as it had in the previous two years combined — both of which were also record years.Driven by a record year in mergers and acquisitions, a robust stock market rally and rapid growth in credit markets — which are now much bigger than stock markets — Goldman posted a record annual profit of $9.5 billion on record revenue of $37.7 billion.Soaring profit means soaring bonuses. Investment bankers who generated a lot of business can expect $20 million to $25 million each, while top traders can take home up to $50 million, according to executives at other leading banks.'"

"'06-12-16,'0','“We got used to it,” said his friend, Orif Tordjman, 21, who had also just completed her military service. “We’re not going to leave because of this alert.”Goa is among India’s most coveted tourist destinations. For Israelis, it is also a common stop on the post-military-service tourist circuit. The embassy in New Delhi estimated that around 35,000 Israelis come to Goa each year, crowding into a handful of coastal villages like this one.Alerts like this latest one, which was unusual for its level of specificity, are particularly vexing for the Indian government, which has long maintained that Al Qaeda does not operate on Indian soil. In August, in the days leading up to India’s Independence Day, the United States Embassy said it had received information that foreign terrorists, including Al Qaeda, planned to carry out a series of bombings in and around New Delhi and Mumbai. Indian officials dismissed the alert as a routine advisory.India has cultivated warmer relations with Israel and the United States, making it, according to some security analysts, more vulnerable to Qaeda attacks.Local news outlets on Friday quoted the chief minister of Goa, Pratapsing Rane, as saying that his state remained safe for tourists. Tourism is among the state’s principal sources of revenue.At an Internet cafe on Anjuna’s main strip, Shai Zimon, 23, who had been traveling across India for the past 6 weeks, said he was hunting for a ticket to fly to Thailand for New Year’s Eve, but not because of the terrorism threat. “You can’t base your trip on what the government says,” he said.If you did, piped in a Swiss woman, Gitta Klee, also checking e-mail messages, no one would ever go anywhere.Ms. Klee, 53, who has lived in Goa for more than 27 years, theorized that the terrorism alert was the brainchild of anxious parents not wanting their children to party in Goa. “Me, I don’t think this place is interesting enough for terrorists,” she said.Word seemed not to have spread yet to the non-Israeli tourists who crowd into some of the same cheap guesthouses here. A pair of German tourists waiting for a bus to the beach were oblivious to the alert. A British tourist, Mustapha Dari, 24, said he had heard only something vague from a friend who had watched the news the night before on Indian television. His friend, Raffi Israelion, 20, a Parisian, confessed that he was particularly worried because local residents often took him to be Israeli.At a Jewish community house on Friday afternoon, the news had seeped in, and the visit of a foreign journalist was enough to spark fear and hostility. At first, two women sitting on the porch of the house, where preparations were under way for a service to mark the first night of Hanukkah, said they knew of three friends who had canceled their New Year’s Eve plans for Goa.They said friends and family in Israel had already called them and urged them to return home. They weren’t sure what they would do. One of the women, who gave her name only as Adi, said she did not want Al Qaeda to “ruin our plans.”Nor, it turned out, did she want to say any more to a stranger. The conversation quickly turned tense. Why are you asking for our names, they demanded. Why do you want to know when the first candle would be lit on the menorah this evening? Why are you asking if we will stay here for the New Year’s holiday?“All this situation, I don’t know,” Adi said nervously, and quickly disappeared into the house.'"
"'06-12-16,'0','INDIANAPOLIS, Dec. 15 — Steve Francis will be out two more weeks as he recovers from tendinitis in his right knee, the Knicks announced Friday. Francis, a starting guard, has been resting the knee since Dec. 7.Francis visited a knee specialist, Dr. Ben Shaffer, in Washington on Thursday. Shaffer evaluated two magnetic resonance imaging tests — one taken in early October and one taken Thursday — and concluded that the knee was improving.Francis will wear a temporary brace and continue a rehabilitation program designed to strengthen the area. Francis will probably be cleared to play when he is examined again in two weeks, right before the Knicks leave for a five-game trip to the West.If Francis returns then, he will have missed 10 consecutive games, and 13 of 31 this season.Jamal Crawford has replaced Francis in the lineup.'"
"'06-12-16,'0','His supporters praise him for strengthening the political muscle of Puerto Ricans in New York City and for building a family dynasty in the Bronx. Mr. Rivera is the father of two Bronx elected officials, Assemblywoman Naomi Rivera and Councilman Joel Rivera, the majority leader.Mr. Rivera’s detractors and even some of his acquaintances criticize him for transforming himself from a political street-fighter to a behind-the-scenes insider eager to increase his family’s influence, and others complain that his disorganized leadership style has diminished the Bronx Democratic machine’s once formidable power.And there is another reason some are uncertain about Mr. Rivera’s legacy: He is being investigated by the F.B.I. over allegations of wrongdoing involving real estate dealings, according to a law enforcement official familiar with the investigation who spoke about the matter only on condition of anonymity.Acknowledging that the investigation is under way, Mr. Rivera said that he had done nothing to warrant it and that investigators had not questioned him. “No one can ever accuse me of ever asking for anything, in return for me ever helping anybody, on any issue, whether you’re a poor guy or well off,” Mr. Rivera said in an interview on Thursday. “If they want to fish, they have a right to fish.”Mr. Rivera’s political identity has been shaped by his Puerto Rican roots, just as the Bronx itself — its 300,000 Puerto Ricans would make it the second-largest city in Puerto Rico — has been shaped by its Puerto Rican identity. In 2001, Mr. Rivera was arrested on the Puerto Rican island of Vieques in a protest against the United States Navy’s use of a base on the island for bombing exercises. He and three others who were arrested for trespassing and sentenced to jail became known as the Vieques Four.“José has never stopped being a street activist, and that’s his charm and his strength,” said José E. Serrano, a Bronx congressman.The borough president, Adolfo Carrión Jr., said he and other Puerto Rican leaders owed Mr. Rivera a debt of gratitude. In 2001, Mr. Rivera set aside his own political ambitions in deference to Mr. Carrión, withdrawing from the borough president race in the interest of party unity. “José’s primary concern is to ensure that Latinos and other historically marginalized communities have a place at the political table,” said Mr. Carrión, who not only served on the City Council with Mr. Rivera but also served time in the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn with him as well, as one of the Vieques Four.Mr. Rivera’s record and remarks as a legislator have also attracted some criticism. In 1995, he had one of the worst attendance records as a council member. He angered many of the borough’s Jewish residents when he cast the plans to put a water filtration plant in Van Cortlandt Park as a battle between Puerto Ricans and Jews, remarks he later apologized for.Howard Jordán, a lawyer who teaches public administration at Hostos Community College, was part of an advocacy group called Latinos United for Political Action, which helped Mr. Rivera win an Assembly race in 1982, his first major political victory. Mr. Jordán said Mr. Rivera was once a political reformer, but no longer. “I think his heart is very much in the right place, but I think at some point he became much more of an establishment figure,” Mr. Jordán said.Mr. Jordán and a number of other political observers and Bronx politicians are critical of the insularity and nepotism within the county organization. Some said the group has not been as effective as it was under Mr. Rivera’s predecessor, Roberto Ramirez, a former assemblyman regarded as a forceful manager. “I found Roberto to be a hard driver, to be very inclusive of people, molding a solid Democratic Party,” said Assemblyman Michael A. Benjamin, a Bronx Democrat. Under Mr. Rivera, he added, “Some of that has been lacking.”Mr. Rivera said his style was less aggressive than Mr. Ramirez’s, but just as effective. “I have a lot of patience,” he said. “I can wear you down with my patience.”In some political circles, Mr. Rivera is called the Columbo of Bronx politics, a reference to the television detective who used his unassuming manner to tactical advantage. “He’s generally 16 steps ahead of most people,” said Mr. Ferrer.Mr. Rivera is regarded by some as rather eccentric. He is rarely without his video camera. He has footage of decades-old demonstrations, of his travels around the world, of Bronx ribbon-cuttings. He estimated that he has about 3,000 tapes in his Albany office and another 2,000 at home in the Bronx.“I use video as a tool to organize, to document just about every good thing that happens in our neighborhood,” he said.One day several years ago, Mr. Rivera visited a vacant lot on Longfellow Avenue in the South Bronx with his longtime adviser, Michael D. Nieves. A boy about 8 years old approached and told them that politicians were all the same, that they never did anything for people.Mr. Rivera asked the boy what he wanted to see in the lot.“There’s a court there today,” Mr. Nieves said in recalling the encounter.'"
"'06-12-16,'0','Dr. Robert W. Wissler, a cardiovascular researcher who, with others, discovered that a combination of smoking and high cholesterol in young men could damage arteries earlier and more significantly than previously known, died on Nov. 28 in Chicago. He was 89.The cause was respiratory failure, his family said.The findings about artery damage resulted from a national study that Dr. Wissler, a professor of pathology at the University of Chicago, helped direct, beginning in 1983. The researchers looked at blood vessels recovered from men, ages 15 to 34, who had died suddenly without evidence of chronic disease.The team discovered that fatty streaks, a condition that can lead to arterial plaque, were present in some cases and that smokers were at particular risk of developing lesions on the right coronary artery and the abdominal aorta.The study, “Pathobiological Determinants of Atherosclerosis in Youth,” was published in The Journal of the American Medical Association in 1990. It was received as “dramatic documentation of how early cardiovascular disease occurs,” said Dr. Angelo M. Scanu, a cardiologist who is director of the University of Chicago Hospitals Lipid Clinic.The study underscored Dr. Wissler’s belief that cardiovascular illness could often be minimized or even prevented by altering a patient’s diet. Using laboratory rats and rhesus monkeys, he conducted dietary studies in which he manipulated the animals’ nutrition to measure cholesterol levels and their effect on creating or retarding arterial plaque.'"
"'06-12-16,'0','BIRMINGHAM, Ala., Dec. 15 (AP) — A state jury ruled Friday in favor of the drug manufacturer Merck & Company in a product liability lawsuit, rejecting the claims of an Alabama man who blamed the painkiller Vioxx for a heart attack in 2001.The jury of eight women and four men returned the verdict in less than two hours in the second favorable verdict for Merck in three days.The suit was filed by Gary Albright, 57, of Chelsea, who claimed that Vioxx caused his heart attack and that the company had failed to reveal potential dangers of the drug before pulling it from the market in 2004. He was seeking as much as $5.75 million.In the earlier case, a federal jury in New Orleans ruled for Merck on Wednesday.“Juries continue to determine that Merck acted responsibly in its research of Vioxx and provided the appropriate information about Vioxx to patients and the medical community,” a Merck executive vice president and general counsel, Kenneth C. Frazier, said in a statement.A lawyer for Mr. Albright, Stephen Heninger, said an appeal was possible. “We’re disappointed, but it’s tough when you go against a Goliath,” he said.'"
"'06-12-16,'0','“I don’t know how many years I have left to play,” Garcia said during a conference call with reporters Wednesday. “And this is a great opportunity for me to show that I still am capable of playing the game at a high level, to be a part of something special.”The Eagles signed Garcia in the off-season. It was a comfortable fit. Philadelphia uses a version of the West Coast offense nearly identical to that which Garcia played in San Francisco and Detroit. The Eagles’ offensive coordinator, Marty Mornhinweg, held the same position in San Francisco when Garcia was there.Philadelphia’s starter, Donovan McNabb, hurt his right knee Nov. 19, and the Eagles, who opened the season 4-1, were on their way to losing five of their next six games. The season looked to be a facsimile of 2005, when injuries to McNabb helped lead to a 6-10 record.Garcia, listed generously at 6 feet 1 inch and 200 pounds, was not seen as any sort of season savior. Not that he has ever been one.“I think it’s just something that I’m used to,” Garcia said. “I’m used to being in the underdog position. I’m used to being in a position where people doubt my own abilities and doubt what I can bring to the field.”Again, the doubts are washing away. The Eagles lost Garcia’s first start, to Indianapolis, but have won the past two. Garcia, at his hyperactive best, rolling out and throwing sharp, short passes, has thrown for eight touchdowns and no interceptions. His passer rating the past three games is 113.7. Only one quarterback, Drew Brees of the New Orleans Saints, has a season-long rating better than 100.The Giants, in paying the ultimate compliment, said that the Eagles were not doing anything differently with Garcia than they did with McNabb. Garcia has closed the usual gap between first string and second string.Giants Coach Tom Coughlin said, “When you watch this team and the way they are performing right now, it would be hard to call this guy a backup quarterback.”But it is easy to call him an underdog.Defensive end Michael Strahan (sprained foot) was still listed as doubtful on the injury report, but his availability may be a game-day decision. Strahan, who has missed five games, did some drills for the third day in a row, though he did not participate in teamwide work. Tom Coughlin called it “progress.” Asked if he expected Strahan to test his availability on the field before Sunday’s game, Coughlin said: “I don’t know that. We haven’t decided that.” But he acknowledged the difference Strahan could make, if and when he receives medical clearance. “There isn’t any question that when we get this thing licked and he’s ready to go, it will be a big lift for our team,” he said. Strahan, in the locker room, would not comment. ... Center Shaun O’Hara (sprained ankle) did not practice all week but was listed as questionable.'"
"'06-12-16,'0','Mountain searches are difficult even in more traversed regions. For several days searchers have been unable to locate three climbers lost on Mount Hood in Oregon, even though the rescue team has detected their cellphone signals. Earlier this month, a father, James Kim, died of exposure with hypothermia when he tried to find help after his family became stranded in their car in the Klamath Mountains in Oregon.Mr. Fowler and Ms. Boskoff are considered accomplished mountaineers and have each climbed many of the world’s highest peaks, including Mount Everest.“Christine is still probably considered the top female high-altitude climber in the world,” said Mark Gunlogson, president of Mountain Madness, an adventure travel company in Seattle owned by Ms. Boskoff. “Charlie is among the most well-known and experienced climbers in North America.”Mr. Gunlogson described the pair as climbing partners and said they left the United States in October. He said southwest China attracted the most experienced and adventurous climbers because the difficult terrain remained relatively uncharted. Mr. Fowler, a writer and photographer who also has been involved in making films about mountain climbing, is considered an experienced climber in this section of China. On his Web site, Mr. Fowler said this would be his fifth trip to the region.“Charlie has a rather extensive list of peaks that he would love to climb,” Mr. Gunlogson said. “They both together probably had quite a hit list.”Early in the trip, the two climbers sent word by e-mail of an initial success as they made an ascent of Haizi Shan. This week the Web site of Alpinist Magazine reported that Mr. Fowler sent an e-mail message on Nov. 7, shortly before he and Ms. Boskoff left Litang.“We’re in the town of Litang for a few days, getting ready for one more trip into the hills,” he wrote. “We just got back from attempting a peak I tried in ’96 doing a film. Didn’t make it that time due to complications with the film crew. This time the peak was a lot less icy (global warming?). We got near the top but backed off due to scary conditions — thin snow over rock slabs. Had a blast climbing as far as we did, though.”He added: “Now off to one more different area to try a 6,000-meter peak and a smaller one, then traveling back doing the tourist thing.”The pair apparently has not been heard from since roughly that time. In Litang a search team has questioned local shopkeepers, but none have seen any American climbers. Searchers also have interviewed Buddhist monks at a monastery at the base of Genyen Mountain, a peak the pair may have been considering.None of the monks recalled seeing any climbers, according to a local police officer involved in the search. “We’ve been looking for five days,” said the officer, Nyima Tsering. “In the last month no foreigners have gone into the mountains.”Officer Tsering said a second search team had traveled west to the city of Batang to determine whether the two climbers might have decided to ascend Genyen Mountain from that direction.Alpinist reported that files on Mr. Fowler’s computer suggested that he intended to travel south, perhaps near the city of Deqen in Yunnan Province, to attempt an unnamed peak nearly 23,000 feet high.Mr. Gunlogson said the climbers had been regularly sending e-mail messages to friends in the United States in October and early November, so the lack of recent contact was particularly worrying. He said the pair might have succumbed to a fatal accident or could be trapped in a remote valley.He said an independent search team led by Jon Otto, a climber with years of experience in China, has been organized to search the mountains.“Climbing, where you’re sort of on the cutting edge, it’s a numbers game in terms of the odds of something bad happening to you,” Mr. Gunlogson said. “There’s all sorts of things that could have happened.”'"

"'06-12-17,'0','Federal prosecutors succeeded in putting a few of them on trial in federal court in New York. Ironically, the federal judge issued rulings on the 1993 World Trade Center bombing just weeks before the hijacked planes crashed into the towers. Efforts to capture or kill al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden throughout the 1990s were shelved, out of concerns that the Justice Department did not have enough evidence to satisfy the legal standard for a criminal arrest.A return to this state of affairs would be a huge mistake. Bipartisan studies of the failings that led up to 9/11 refer to the inadequacy of the criminal justice approach to deal effectively with an ideologically motivated military organization like al Qaeda. If 9/11 started a war between the United States and al Qaeda, the United States can employ its war powers to kill enemy operatives and their leaders, detain them without trial until the end of the conflict, interrogate them without lawyers or Miranda protections, and try them without civilian juries. No doubt these measures seem unusual, even draconian, but the rules of war provide nations with their most forceful tools to defend their people from attack. We are faced with the difficult task of adapting those rules for the unprecedented appearance on the world stage of an enemy that, while not a nation, can inflict violence at a level once only in the hands of nations. To make wise policy choices, it is essential to understand the difference between, and the appropriate uses of, war as opposed to criminal prosecution. War is too important to be the subject of partisan politics.Here is how we at the Justice Department sat down to think about September 11. On that clear, sunny day, four coordinated attacks had taken place in rapid succession, aimed at critical buildings at the heart of our national financial system and our nation's capital. The terrorists who hijacked these airplanes in some ways had conventional military objectives-to decapitate America's political, military, and economic headquarters. They failed at the first, partially achieved the second (the American Airlines flight from Dulles Airport to Los Angeles struck a recently modernized and reinforced section of the Pentagon, resulting in far lower casualties and destruction than it would have otherwise inflicted), and succeeded at the third. The attacks killed more people than the Japanese Navy had killed at Pearl Harbor-approximately three thousand, with thousands more injured. They also disrupted air traffic and communications, closed the national stock exchanges for days, and caused billions of dollars in damage.The attackers wore no uniforms, carried no arms openly, and did not operate as part of regular military units. Instead, Mohammed Atta and his eighteen fellow hijackers disguised themselves as civilians, used civilian aircraft as weapons, and launched their attacks by surprise from within our borders. Deliberately targeting and killing civilians is deeply immoral, violating the core principle of the law of war-that combatants are only to target each other and must attempt to minimize harm to innocent civilians.The attacks were both vicious and skillful. Al Qaeda's operatives infiltrated past our immigration and border controls, operated within our borders for years, and gained the skills needed to fly airplanes into buildings at schools in the United States without ever being detected by American intelligence or law enforcement. They simultaneously hi- jacked four aircraft within minutes of each other, and succeeded in hitting three of their targets with devastating effect. Even though they were going to their certain deaths, the hijackers maintained operational security for months, if not years, and managed to take the United States completely by surprise. Without any conventional armed forces or the military resources of a nation-state, al Qaeda inflicted a level of destruction on the United States that only a few nations would have been capable of achieving. Evil doesn't necessarily mean stupid or incompetent.If a nation-state had carried out the same attacks on the same targets, there would have been no question about whether a state of war would have existed. If, during the Cold War, the Soviet Union had sent KGB agents to drive airplanes through American skyscrapers, the United States would have retaliated, our nation would have gone on a war footing, and our mutual self-defense agreements with other countries would have come into play. Why should status as an international terrorist organization rather than a nation-state make a difference as to whether we are at war?The most singular and defining characteristic of the hijackers to a lawyer, the one that makes them unprecedented in our history, is that they fight on behalf of no nation. They launched their attacks on behalf of a network of Islamic radicals who have dedicated themselves to a terror jihad against the West. Many were from Saudi Arabia, one of the United States' closest and oldest allies in the Middle East. While al Qaeda did not immediately claim responsibility for the attacks, American intelligence became certain of its responsibility. Videotape later captured in Afghanistan showed al Qaeda leaders discussing their planning and goals for the operation.While al Qaeda was not a household word before the September 11 attacks, the United States had suffered repeated attacks at its hands. These include the suicide bombing of the USS Cole in 2000, the bombing of American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in 1998, the attack on a U.S. military housing complex in Saudi Arabia in 1996, and the bombing of the World Trade Center in 1993. Only good intelligence and law enforcement work, helpful allies, and luck had frustrated planned attacks on American airliners over the Pacific Ocean, at Los Angeles airport during the millennium, and at various American embassies and personnel in Europe and Asia.Public information about the group remains incomplete, but there is much agreement on its basic features and goals. Al Qaeda is a network of terrorists who wish to engineer fundamental political and social change in the Middle East. Some members, including bin Laden, are veterans of the successful resistance to the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan. With the help of Saudi funding, the Reagan administration helped train and arm mujahadeen resistance fighters from many different Arab countries to defeat the Soviets. When the war ended, some of these fighters banded together with the aim of overthrowing Arab regimes at home. They seethed at the rise of the Christian West, the decline of the Islamic caliphate-which had once stretched from India to Spain-the presence of American troops in the holy land of Saudi Arabia, and at current Arab regimes, which they saw as corrupt and untrue to fundamentalist Islamic principles.It is as important to understand al Qaeda's ideology as it was to know the worldview of our communist opponents in the Cold War. Al Qaeda members view recent history as a Manichaean struggle between Islam and the West. To them, the United States is the cause of the conflicts and reverses suffered by the Islamic world. Over the long term, al Qaeda thinkers believe America must be forced to withdraw from the Middle East and that U.S. citizens must be converted to Islam. Attacking the United States also serves the near-term objective of undermining its Arab allies in Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and Jordan and replacing them with a fundamentalist Islamic caliphate. ""Our fight against these governments is not separate from our fight against"" the United States, bin Laden says. Publicity is another goal. Showing the United States to be weak and vulnerable helps al Qaeda to gain new recruits and destabilize secular governments in predominantly Islamic parts of the world. While other Islamic terrorist groups have focused on Israel, for bin Laden and his followers the United States is ""the head of the snake."" Al Qaeda had announced its goals at least as early as 1996, when bin Laden issued a fatwa-an interpretation of Islamic law-calling on Muslims to drive American troops out of the Middle East. Two years later, bin Laden and his number two, Egyptian doctor Ayman al Zawahiri, declared war against all Americans, saying that it was ""the individual duty for every Muslim who can do it in any country in which it is possible to do it"" to kill an American. In an ABC interview shortly thereafter, bin Laden said that ""the worst thieves in the world today and the worst terrorists are the Americans. Nothing could stop you except perhaps retaliation in kind."" The question was never whether al Qaeda wanted to attack the United States and kill its citizens. The question was only if it had the wherewithal to carry out its threats.In 2001, al Qaeda had several sources of support. Most directly, it had the shelter of the Taliban in Afghanistan. The Taliban, in turn, received support from Pakistan's military and intelligence services. Al Qaeda gave the Taliban money and a core of loyal fighters; in exchange al Qaeda got a training base and a safe harbor from which to operate. In 2001 as well as today al Qaeda receives its financial support from private and religious charities and individuals, mainly based in Saudi Arabia. It draws its manpower from the pool of disaffected, alienated, or unemployed young men bitter over the Arab world's poverty and decline. It appeals to their fundamental religious beliefs in a time of unsettling change wrought by globalization and social upheaval.Al Qaeda benefits from our technological age, in which small guerrilla bands, aided by the spread into the global public domain of virulent technologies-chemical, biological, and nuclear-can wreak destruction such as no small group has ever been able to before.Al Qaeda's terrorist campaign against the United States and its allies continues to this day. It is believed to have been responsible for, or connected with, numerous terrorist incidents following September 11, including the December 2001 attempt by Richard Reid to ignite a shoe bomb on a transatlantic flight from Paris to Boston, an April 2002 explosion at a synagogue in Djerba, an October 2002 explosion on a French oil tanker off the Yemeni coast, a series of bombs on the Indonesian resort island of Bali that same month, and two attacks on Israeli targets in Kenya in November 2002. Al Qaeda apparently carried out the bombings of the Madrid train stations in 2004 that led to the withdrawal of Spanish troops from Iraq, and its operatives are behind some of the attacks on American troops currently in Iraq supporting that country's new government. It may also have been behind the London bombings on July 7, 2005.Al Qaeda operates in an unconventional and, as strategic analysts like to say, asymmetric manner. Its operatives do not wear uniforms, nor do they form conventional units or force structures. Rather, their personnel, material, and leadership are organized in covert cells. Al Qaeda has no interest in meeting American armed forces on the battlefield, but resorts to surprise attacks, primarily on civilian targets, using unconventional weapons and tactics. Victory for al Qaeda does not mean defeating the enemy's forces and negotiating a political settlement, but demoralizing the enemy's society and coercing it to act in ways that al Qaeda prefers.Another factor that distinguishes the conflict with al Qaeda from previous wars is jurisdiction, an issue that crops up whenever lawyers become involved. In earlier modern American conflicts, hostilities took place on a foreign battlefield. The United States home front was largely safe between two oceans. Today the battlefield may be anywhere. Possessing no territory, population, or regular armed units, al Qaeda depends on the covert use of global transportation and commercial channels to move its men and resources across borders undetected. This erases the traditional boundaries between the battlefield and the home front.Why War The United States has faced violence from non-state actors before. We have used the criminal justice system to handle pirates, domestic terror groups, the Mafia, and drug cartels. But there is a line, however indistinct, between crime and war. In war, nations use special powers to prevent future attacks on their citizens and territory, not to punish past conduct. Law enforcement tries to solve crimes that have occurred in the past. Our military and intelligence agents seek to stop deadly foreign attacks that may happen in the future. The difference in purpose dictates different tools. The FBI and the DEA-not the U.S. armed forces-have prime responsibility for interdicting drug smuggling (although the military sometimes plays a supporting role). They seek to disrupt the operations of drug cartels with traditional tools of law enforcement: interviewing witnesses, collecting physical evidence, and carrying out surveillance. An investigation usually occurs only after a crime has occurred. Deadly force may be used only if necessary to defend the law enforcement agent's life, or another's, against an imminent attack. . . .'"

"'06-12-17,'0','Rescuers searching for three missing climbers on Mount Hood in Oregon have located a snow cave, some equipment and what appears to be a “Y” carved into the snowy flanks of the mountain, and crews were converging on the location to see if there was any sign of the men, officials said today.Capt. Mike Braibish, from the Oregon National Guard, said that the crews were closing in on the location where the equipment, an ice spike and a coil of rope were detected in an area close to where a signal from a cellphone belonging to one of the climbers had been received last week.Rescuers in a helicopter had detected what they thought was a snow cave Saturday night and returned in clear weather today to confirm it. Captain Braibish said that he had no information about the status of the three climbers, but that the area is now a “target that has shrunk down”.“We are very hopeful that we will have more information later today,” Captain Braibish said during a televised news conference.Footprints were also detected near the summit of Mount Hood, as well as what was believed to be the letter “Y,” which climbers use as an emergency signal for the word “Yes” as visible from the air, said Gerry Tiffany, a sergeant with the Hood River County sheriff’s office.The terrain for the rescuers was treacherous, with a threat of avalanches, bitter cold temperatures and steep banks. Captain Braibish said it was very risky to get the rescue climbers up to that elevation on the northeast portion of the mountain in an area of solid ice, from which they would descend down to the snow cave, which is about 300 feet below the summit.The search for the climbers had been delayed by bad weather that had raked across the Pacific Northwest last week, bringing heavy rain to Seattle and its suburbs and blizzard conditions to other areas.'"
"'06-12-17,'0','CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla., Dec. 16 (AP) — A pair of spacewalkers manually shaking a stubborn solar array on the International Space Station managed to free some stuck grommets on Saturday, but not enough to fold the array into a box properly.The array was more than half retracted when the astronauts, Capt. Robert L. Curbeam Jr. and Cmdr. Sunita L. Williams, approached it after completing their main spacewalk tasks. After scores of shakes and remote control commands to retract, the array folded several degrees more, eventually retracting 65 percent.“We really commend you for a tremendous effort, an Olympian effort of our two shaking E.V.A. members,” Mission Control radioed to the astronauts, using the technical acronym for a spacewalk. The astronauts spent 7 hours, 31 minutes on the spacewalk, the last two hours working on the array.Captain Curbeam and Commander Williams made progress on a problem that has vexed the National Aeronautics and Space Administration since Wednesday. Earlier in the day, the agency approved conducting a fourth, unplanned spacewalk if the astronauts were unable to get the accordion-like array to fold up properly.It is unclear whether NASA will go ahead with the additional spacewalk. If carried out as planned on Monday, it will delay the space shuttle Discovery’s landing at the Kennedy Space Center by one day, to Friday, and push back other activities like undocking and a late inspection of the shuttle’s heat shield.The partially retracted solar wing was part of the space station’s temporary power system.A primary goal of the shuttle mission was to rewire the station and hook a new set of solar wings, delivered in September, onto the permanent electricity grid. To do that, NASA needed to retract the old solar panel so the new ones would have room to rotate with the movement of the sun to maximize the amount of electricity generated.'"
"'06-12-17,'0','But as early as 1999, the documents show that Lilly worried that side effects from Zyprexa, whose chemical name is olanzapine, would hurt sales.“Olanzapine-associated weight gain and possible hyperglycemia is a major threat to the long-term success of this critically important molecule,” Dr. Alan Breier wrote in a November 1999 e-mail message to two-dozen Lilly employees that announced the formation of an “executive steering committee for olanzapine-associated weight changes and hyperglycemia.” Hyperglycemia is high blood sugar.At the time Dr. Breier, who is now Lilly’s chief medical officer, was the chief scientist on the Zyprexa program.In 2000, a group of diabetes doctors that Lilly had retained to consider potential links between Zyprexa and diabetes warned the company that “unless we come clean on this, it could get much more serious than we might anticipate,” according to an e-mail message from one Lilly manager to another.And in that year and 2001, the documents show, Lilly’s own marketing research found that psychiatrists were consistently saying that many more of their patients developed high blood sugar or diabetes while taking Zyprexa than other antipsychotic drugs.The documents were collected as part of lawsuits on behalf of mentally ill patients against the company. Last year, Lilly agreed to pay $750 million to settle suits by 8,000 people who claimed they developed diabetes or other medical problems after taking Zyprexa. Thousands more suits against the company are pending.On Friday, in its written response, Lilly said that it believed that Zyprexa remained an important treatment for patients with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. The company said it had given the Food and Drug Administration all its data from clinical trials and reports of adverse events, as it is legally required to do. Lilly also said it shared data from literature reviews and large studies of Zyprexa’s real-world use.“In summary, there is no scientific evidence establishing that Zyprexa causes diabetes,” the company said.Lilly also said the documents should not have been made public because they might “cause unwarranted fear among patients that will cause them to stop taking their medication.”As did similar documents disclosed by the drug maker Merck last year in response to lawsuits over its painkiller Vioxx, the Lilly documents offer an inside look at how a company marketed a drug while seeking to play down its side effects. Lilly, based in Indianapolis, is the sixth-largest American drug maker, with $14 billion in revenue last year.The documents — which include e-mail, marketing material, sales projections and scientific reports — are replete with references to Zyprexa’s importance to Lilly’s future and the need to keep concerns about diabetes and obesity from hurting sales. But that effort became increasingly difficult as doctors saw Zyprexa’s side effects, the documents show.In 2002, for example, Lilly rejected plans to give psychiatrists guidance about how to treat diabetes, worrying that doing so would tarnish Zyprexa’s reputation. “Although M.D.’s like objective, educational materials, having our reps provide some with diabetes would further build its association to Zyprexa,” a Lilly manager wrote in a March 2002 e-mail message.But Lilly did expand its marketing to primary care physicians, who its internal studies showed were less aware of Zyprexa’s side effects. Lilly sales material encouraged representatives to promote Zyprexa as a “safe, gentle psychotropic” suitable for people with mild mental illness.Some top psychiatrists say that Zyprexa will continue to be widely used despite its side effects, because it works better than most other antipsychotic medicines in severely ill patients. But others say that Zyprexa appears no more effective overall than other medicines.And some doctors who specialize in diabetes care dispute Lilly’s assertion that Zyprexa does not cause more cases of diabetes than other psychiatric drugs. “When somebody gains weight, they need more insulin, they become more insulin resistant,” Dr. Joel Zonszein, the director of the clinical diabetes center at Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx, said when asked about the drug.In 2003, after reviewing data provided by Lilly and other drug makers, the F.D.A. said that the current class of antipsychotic drugs may cause high blood sugar. It did not specifically single out Zyprexa, nor did it say that the drugs had been proven to cause diabetes.The drugs are known as atypical antipsychotics and include Johnson & Johnson’s Risperdal and AstraZeneca’s Seroquel. When they were introduced in the mid-1990s, psychiatrists hoped they would relieve mental illness without the tremors and facial twitches associated with older drugs. But the new drugs have not proven significantly better and have their own side effects, said Dr. Jeffrey Lieberman, the lead investigator on a federally sponsored clinical trial that compared Zyprexa and other new drugs with one older one.The Zyprexa documents were provided to the Times by James B. Gottstein, a lawyer who represents mentally ill patients and has sued the state of Alaska over its efforts to force patients to take psychiatric medicines against their will. Mr. Gottstein said the information in the documents raised public health issues.“Patients should be told the truth about drugs like Zyprexa,” Mr. Gottstein said.Lilly originally provided the documents, under seal, to plaintiffs lawyers who sued the company claiming their clients developed diabetes from taking Zyprexa. Mr. Gottstein, who is not subject to the confidentiality agreement that covers the product liability suits, subpoenaed the documents in early December from a person involved in the suits.In its statement, Lilly called the release of the documents “illegal.” The company said it could not comment on specific documents because of the continuing product liability suits.In some ways, the Zyprexa documents are reminiscent of those produced in litigation over Vioxx, which Merck stopped selling in 2004 after a clinical trial proved it caused heart problems. They treat very different conditions, but Zyprexa and Vioxx are not entirely dissimilar. Both were thought to be safer than older and cheaper drugs, becoming bestsellers as a result, but turned out to have serious side effects.After being pressed by doctors and regulators, Merck eventually did test Vioxx’s cardiovascular risks and withdrew the drug after finding that Vioxx increased heart attacks and strokes.Lilly has never conducted a clinical trial to determine exactly how much Zyprexa raises patients’ diabetes risks. But scientists say conducting such a study would be exceedingly difficult, because diabetes takes years to develop, and it can be hard to keep mentally ill patients enrolled in a clinical trial.When it was introduced, Zyprexa was the third and most heralded of the atypical antipsychotics. With psychiatrists eager for new treatments for schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and dementia, Zyprexa’s sales soared.But as sales grew, reports rolled in to Lilly and drug regulators that the medicine caused massive weight gain in many patients and was associated with diabetes. For example, a California doctor reported that 8 of his 35 patients on Zyprexa had developed high blood sugar, including two who required hospitalization.The documents show that Lilly encouraged its sales representatives to play down those effects when talking to doctors. In one 1998 presentation, for example, Lilly said its salespeople should be told, “Don’t introduce the issue!!!” Meanwhile, the company researched combinations of Zyprexa with several other drugs, hoping to alleviate the weight gain. But the combinations failed.To reassure doctors, Lilly also publicly said that when it followed up with patients who had taken Zyprexa in a clinical trial for three years, it found that weight gain appeared to plateau after about nine months. But the company did not discuss a far less reassuring finding in early 1999, disclosed in the documents, that blood sugar levels in the patients increased steadily for three years.In 2000 and 2001, more warning signs emerged, the documents show. In four surveys conducted by Lilly’s marketing department, the company found that 70 percent of psychiatrists polled had seen at least one of their patients develop high blood sugar or diabetes while taking Zyprexa, compared with about 20 percent for Risperdal or Seroquel. Lilly never disclosed those findings.By mid-2003, Lilly began to change its stance somewhat, publicly acknowledging that Zyprexa can cause severe obesity. Marketing documents make clear that by then Lilly believed it had no choice. On June 23, 2003, an internal committee reported that Zyprexa sales were “below plan” and that doctors were “switching/avoiding Zyprexa.”Since then, Lilly has acknowledged Zyprexa’s effect on weight but has argued that it does not necessarily correlate to diabetes. But Zyprexa’s share of antipsychotic drug prescriptions is falling, and some psychiatrists say they no longer believe the information Lilly offers.“From my personal experience, at first my concerns about weight gain with this drug were very significantly downplayed by their field representatives,” said Dr. James Phelps, a psychiatrist in Corvallis, Or. ‘Their continued efforts to downplay that, I think in retrospect, was an embarrassment to the company.”Dr. Phelps says that he tries to avoid Zyprexa because of its side effects but sometimes still prescribes it, especially when patients are acutely psychotic and considering suicide, because it works faster than other medicines.“I wind up using it as an emergency medicine, where it’s superb,” he said. “But I’m trying to get my patients off of Zyprexa, not put them on.”'"
"'06-12-17,'0','Mr. Gingrich has had plenty of experience in politics, having served in Congress for 20 years, bringing Republicans to a majority in the House for the first time in 40 years in 1994. That majority fell last month, brought low in part by partisan warfare and scandal, eight years after Mr. Gingrich himself was ousted for some of the same sins.And while Mr. Gingrich at the moment is not hiring consultants and opening exploratory committees, others are. Analysts and even some friends of Mr. Gingrich warn that he is losing ground that will be hard to make up if he enters the race later.But as other non- and quasi-candidates have demonstrated over the years, even toying with a presidential run can attract lots of attention, and with it a soapbox from which to promote an agenda.In Mr. Gingrich’s case, the agenda includes a new political action committee to try to identify changes America must make to survive. It is an effort that he said would be 50 times as ambitious as the political action committee Gopac, which in the 1980s and ’90s he turned into a training ground for hundreds of Republican politicians and a personal fund-raising fief. It will be, in Mr. Gingrich’s telling, the 1994 Contract With America, which swept Republicans into power on Capitol Hill and him into the speaker’s chair, on an extra-large scale.The new committee, called American Solutions for Winning the Future, will be organized as a so-called 527 group, he said. Those committees, named for a section of the tax code, can raise and spend unlimited money with minimal disclosure.Mr. Gingrich said he would try to raise tens of millions of dollars through the committee to find bipartisan solutions to the nation’s problems. Any candidate of any party who wants to share in the effort will be welcome, he said.The committee will also promote Mr. Gingrich’s latest manifesto, a 10-point Contract With America for the 21st century, which includes Social Security privatization, electoral reform, radical streamlining of government, and “patriotic education” for schoolchildren and immigrants. The document also includes a call to “recenter America on the creator from whom all our liberties come” and to appoint judges who understand “the centrality of God in American history.”As for his presidential ambitions, Mr. Gingrich said he would not make a decision before September. He acknowledged that that was late to begin a serious presidential run in the current system, but noted that John F. Kennedy did not declare his candidacy until January 1960 and that Ronald Reagan entered the 1980 race in November 1979.The Gingrich plan would seem to depend on one or more of the leading Republican presidential hopefuls — Senator John McCain of Arizona, former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani of New York and Gov. Mitt Romney of Massachusetts — falling by the wayside and a groundswell of support for Mr. Gingrich.Many analysts, including some close friends and advisers of Mr. Gingrich, consider that unlikely.“Waiting for the voters to come to him is a mistake, because it just doesn’t happen,” said Frank Luntz, a political strategist who worked closely with Mr. Gingrich in his days in Congress. “When you want to engage in a battle of ideas, you have to engage in a longer campaign.”Joe Gaylord, who was Mr. Gingrich’s lieutenant when he led the 1994 takeover of the House, said that Mr. Gingrich was more widely known than most of the other potential Republican candidates, but that his image might need some repair. “He has huge name ID,” Mr. Gaylord said, “but maybe there needs to be a little rebranding that goes with that.”Mr. Gaylord did not elaborate, but even Mr. Gingrich’s friends said he would carry a lot of baggage into any political race. Two highly publicized divorces. A record $300,000 fine imposed by the House ethics committee over the financing of a college course he taught while in Congress. The 1995 government shutdown. A proposal to place fatherless children in orphanages. The bitter politics surrounding the impeachment of President Bill Clinton in 1998.Mr. Gingrich acknowledged that he was probably better at formulating ideas than at carrying them out, more of a revolutionary agitator than an elected executive. He said that unexpected events swept him into the speaker’s office — though he had spent years planning to get there — and that the same could happen with the Oval Office.“It all depends on whether the movement I’m building gets big enough and how large the vacuum of leadership is,” he said.Merle Black, a professor of government at Emory University and an authority on Southern politics, said Mr. Gingrich was dreaming. His appeal is limited to a relatively narrow slice of right-wing voters, Professor Black said, with virtually no support from independents and Democrats.“He couldn’t get elected to statewide office in Georgia,” Professor Black said, citing a recent poll of Georgia Republicans that placed Mr. Gingrich a distant third in presidential preference in his home state, behind Mr. Giuliani and Mr. McCain. “I cannot imagine him winning a presidential race in the United States.”Running or not, expect Mr. Gingrich to remain in the public eye. He has narrated a special, “One Nation Under God: Religion and History in Washington, D.C.,” to be broadcast on Fox News this weekend, and he will appear on “Meet the Press” on NBC on Sunday to talk about his new organization and his political plans.“My hope is that we’ll have a genuine dialogue over the next year,” he said in the Friday interview. “Then we can get into the political debate.”'"
"'06-12-17,'0','Among the many things that Congress needs to fix are the bill’s broad definition of “illegal enemy combatant,” which could subject legal United States residents to summary imprisonment; its repudiation of the Geneva Conventions to allow the president to decide what prisoner abuse he will permit; its denial of the basic right of appeal to any noncitizen designated as an “illegal enemy combatant”; and its stripping of the powers of federal courts. The law is also far too lax on the use of coerced evidence and secret evidence. The definition of torture should be changed to reflect civilized norms.We were greatly encouraged last week when Senator Patrick Leahy, the Vermont Democrat who will head the Judiciary Committee, said fixing this bill would be a priority for his panel.At the insistence of Mr. Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney, the Military Commissions Act gave legal cover to the Central Intelligence Agency’s secret illegal prisons, which house foreign citizens who are often abducted off the streets of their hometowns and brutalized. Congress should at minimum bring these prisons under the rule of law, and make sure that C.I.A. interrogators are given clear instructions comporting with American values. Ideally, Congress would investigate and decide whether this operation has any national security value, and if it doesn’t, immediately close the prisons down.Mr. Bush personally authorized the National Security Agency to ignore federal law and eavesdrop on telephone calls and e-mail between the United States and other countries without a warrant. Republican lawmakers have introduced bills that would legalize the program after the fact. The only remotely sensible measure is from Senator Dianne Feinstein, the California Democrat who has proposed forcing the eavesdropping back under the 1978 surveillance law and giving the administration a bit more flexibility to do electronic surveillance.But we agree with Senator John Rockefeller IV, the incoming chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, who says more needs to be known about the program before enacting new laws. The administration has stymied Congressional efforts to look into the spying operation, refusing even to turn over the presidential order creating it.Nearly two and a half years ago, the Senate Intelligence Committee reported on the nation’s spy agencies’ prewar failure to figure out that there were no weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, and promised to deliver a report on whether Mr. Bush and his team pressured the agencies to cherry-pick or hype evidence — or lied outright to Americans.Senator Pat Roberts of Kansas, the Republican head of the intelligence panel, dragged out the second phase of the report, with the aim of killing it. We hope Mr. Rockefeller finishes the job.That will require heavy lifting on the most important section, comparing the statements of administration officials to what they knew about the intelligence. Mr. Roberts insisted that it cover every public statement by any administration official or member of Congress dating back to 1991. What President Bill Clinton or Senator Hillary Clinton said about Iraq is irrelevant. What matters is what was said by Mr. Bush and Mr. Cheney — who ordered the invasion of Iraq — and by their aides. We hope Mr. Rockefeller’s committee will sift through the hundreds of statements collected so far and focus on the ones that matter.Unhappily, this is not an exhaustive list and there will be big fights over many of these issues. But it is not too late to take action. The midterm elections prove that despite all the posturing and fearmongering, the American public has not been blinded or deafened to what this country stands for and the need for truth.'"
"'06-12-17,'0','But the truth is, the situation is more complicated. I’m right; my buddy is right; Global Witness, the human rights group, is right; Russell Simmons is right; and Nelson Mandela is right.Mr. Simmons, the hip-hop mogul, and Mr. Mandela, the living saint, have both defended the diamond industry in the face of “Blood Diamond.”Mr. Simmons, who owns a jewelry company, has started a Diamond Empowerment Fund to teach Africans to polish rough stones so that value-adding step can be done there instead of in Israel, Belgium or India.They argue, correctly, that 99 percent of all diamonds come from places that are not presently at war: South Africa, Namibia, Botswana, Tanzania, Russia, Canada, Australia, even Arkansas. Countries where diamonds fueled grotesque atrocities in the 1990’s — Sierra Leone, Liberia and Angola — are at peace, although eastern Congo and Ivory Coast are not.Of all those countries, Namibia and Botswana are as dependent on diamonds as Kuwait is on oil, and even mighty South Africa would be badly shaken if prices plummeted.Moreover, many miners in AIDS-ravaged southern Africa, who get relatively good pay and decent health care, would be thrown out of work.The paradox is that all that human welfare, like all that spilled blood, flows from a carefully constructed fantasy.I once visited Namibia’s “Forbidden Zone,” the 180-mile-long beach where the DeBeers company sifts diamonds out of the sand where the Orange River sweeps the diamond pipes of Lesotho and Kimberley out to sea. The clean, well-run mining town is the engine of Namibia’s economy.It is an eerie place. Since 1936, no vehicle has ever left, in case diamonds are hidden in it. Pet pigeons are forbidden, because they have been caught with gems sewn into tiny jackets. No visitor leaves without a full-body X-ray. Mine detected gravel in my boot soles, so a guard picked out each speck. If one had been a diamond, I could have spent 10 years in jail.The lust for that glittering gravel, extending unbroken from African thieves to British royals to domestic Bridezillas — is manufactured. Hard carbon, as even Nicky Oppenheimer, the charming chairman of DeBeers, has admitted, has no intrinsic value except as grit. DeBeers, which manages the cartel that has kept diamond prices up far more efficiently than OPEC ever did with oil, fosters that romance. It has run the “A Diamond Is Forever” ads since 1948 and still quietly advises gullible grooms that it is “customary” to spend two months’ salary on a ring.Creating new markets is the genius of DeBeers. Getting African-American men to wear bling works for them as well as their 1950’s campaigns to get Japanese brides to demand solitaires. To my mind, bling shootings and pre-marital tiffs over the rock just prove that any diamond can aspire to be a conflict diamond.But true blood diamonds do offend the world’s conscience. While it is possible to laser-etch each stone with an invisible license number, as some Canadian mines do, it is expensive. Instead, the industry has faced the issue with the Kimberley Process: shipments of rough diamonds get certificates of origin. In 2003, Congress passed the Clean Diamond Trade Act, making it illegal to import rough diamonds without certificates.However, said Corina Gilfillan of Global Witness, the process is flawed.Diamonds from war-torn areas get mixed in with others. Corrupt officials can forge certificates. Diamonds are easily smuggled.Most damning, many buyers and many jewelers do not care. Ms. Gilfillan described a documentary in which British film-makers took an actor posing as an African military man into Manhattan dealerships offering diamonds without certificates. He found ready buyers.In September, the Government Accountability Office reported that the law was not enforced. “Because of weaknesses of the system,” it said, “the United States cannot ensure that illicit rough diamonds are not traded.”Mr. Oppenheimer has spoken very sharply on the topic, asking the World Diamond Congress in Tel Aviv in June to “drive out, isolate and eject from our business those who refuse to accept and embrace the absolute imperative to operate in an ethical and morally responsible manner.”A cynic would note that his company also dislikes illegal competition. But Mr. Oppenheimer, like his father Harry, has often pointed out that the industry owes its very life to the Africans who are grinding out of their own continent the baubles that so please the rest of the world.Diamonds, by the way, are not a part of traditional African weddings. In those, the bride is paid for in cows or camels. And Mr. Oppenheimer must be worried more about his industry’s image than its future: diamond sales in China are soaring as post-Mao brides demand white weddings. Fortunately, Leonardo DiCaprio is a big star there.'"
"'06-12-17,'0','Those who pass the exam go on to an oral interview, where they are hammered with questions and situations by several Foreign Service officers, and the best performer gets the job.But now, the State Department wants to try a new approach, a bit less quantifiable. At the suggestion of McKinsey & Company, the management consultants, it plans to revamp the process to evaluate what it calls “the Total Candidate,” The Washington Post disclosed last week. The written exam will stay largely the same, although streamlined and given by computer, instead of bubble-sheet and bluebook. Online, the exam will be given more often, to speed the recruitment process, one of the State Department’s main goals.As applicants register for the exam, they will submit an online “structured résumé” describing their work experience, foreign residence, leadership experience and language abilities, among other things. Then, on the basis of the test results and résumé, combined in some undisclosed metric, a screening committee will decide who goes on to the oral assessment.Some Foreign Service officers, past and present, applaud the new approach:“Testing people on their general knowledge, their ability to parse questions, is a poor standard for bringing people into the Foreign Service,” said Mark Van Fleet, who was posted in Thailand for five years. “You get people who are well educated, and understand the relationship of inflation and interest rates. But the test doesn’t measure more important things, like good judgment.”But the change raises concerns. Some worry that adding more nonquantitative factors could open the door to political considerations, or applicants with family connections. (Note to State Department: to understand the possible complications, talk to the admissions officers at Harvard or Princeton.)Anthony Holmes, president of the American Foreign Service Association, said he was not worried, because the factors to be considered are things like foreign experience and language ability.“Whether you gave to a political party is not in the paradigm,” Mr. Holmes said. “And experience living in a different country is important. McKinsey was just astounded that we didn’t consider anything but test results.”Others, though, are troubled by the proposed revamping, given that the Foreign Service is already so prestigious and so competitive.“Since it’s working really quite well, why make such a major change?” said Robert Gelbard, a former ambassador to Indonesia. “I have great confidence in Condoleezza Rice, but what about the law of unintended consequences? Who knows whether, some years down the road, political factors could creep in?”And will the Foreign Service be dumbed down, given that adding factors will mean that some candidates could qualify with lower scores?Not to worry, said Marianne Myles, director of the State Department’s office of recruitment, examination and employment. There will still be a failing score, and the passing score won’t drop all that much.“The population that applies is so large — and so many of them are so qualified and smart and capable and have so many skills and abilities — that we can’t take them all,” she said. “Rather than sorting by one criterion, we’re going to use more factors. But the very small percentage we take will still be the smartest, most qualified people representing America.”'"
"'06-12-17,'0','She was widely credited with having revived the career of Mickey Rooney, who returned from relative obscurity to make his Broadway debut in “Sugar Babies” in 1979. Ms. Webb also handled personalities like Chuck Connors, Tiny Tim, Phyllis Diller, Bert Parks and Rose Marie.In the 1990s, Ms. Webb’s agency was also famous for what it cheerfully called its scandal division, which represented names intimately familiar to anyone who has ever waited in line at a supermarket.For an agent, such clients pose a special challenge. Ms. Webb’s stable included, at one time or another, people from nontheatrical professions like Tonya Harding (the figure skater disgraced by her role in the attack on Nancy Kerrigan), Joey Buttafuoco (the auto-body shop owner known for his dalliance with the teenage Amy Fisher) and Sydney Biddle Barrows (the Mayflower Madam).It also included friends and business associates of the famous, among them Kato Kaelin (O. J. Simpson), Gennifer Flowers (Bill Clinton) and Divine Brown (Hugh Grant).Then there were those who found notoriety through marriage, including Tammy Faye Messner (better known as Tammy Faye Bakker, who was married to the television evangelist Jim Bakker) and John Wayne Bobbitt (whose wife, Lorena, cut off his penis with a kitchen knife).Even the unsinkable Ms. Webb could not place everyone. Mr. Kaelin was with the agency only briefly. (“He can’t act,” she told The Los Angeles Times in 1994.) Mr. Bobbitt had trouble scheduling an audition because he was expected to be in jail that day. (The agency dropped him after he made a pornographic film.) Ms. Harding was offered a Woody Allen movie but turned it down, saying she abhorred the director’s morals.For many years, Ms. Webb ran her business from her home in the Hollywood Hills. She adored working in her bedroom, where the bedposts were draped with feather boas; the walls were crowded with movie-star photographs (as well as posters for Broadway shows starring her clients, ringed by flashing light bulbs); and every horizontal surface seemed to hold a plush toy, invariably a raccoon.There, in a cloud of white satin bedsheets, Ms. Webb tirelessly worked the phones, persuading and cajoling, often nursing a live baby raccoon from a bottle. Besides the live ones, which she tenderly rescued, Ms. Webb had more than 1,500 stuffed raccoons and countless raccoon figurines. It was her favorite animal. She also owned seven cats, a macaw and a live peacock.Ruth Thea Ford was born in New York on March 17, 1918. In the 1940s, she appeared in several Broadway productions, among them “Marinka,” “Early to Bed” and “On the Town.” She also sang in New York nightclubs like the Latin Quarter and Cafe Society Downtown.Ms. Webb was married twice to actors, once to a lobster salesman and once to a man whose line of work (something to do with making bottle caps) resulted, she often said, in the Mafia’s putting a price on her head. (“The mob put out a contract on me, and my husband put out a contract on the guy who put out the contract on me,” she told The Washington Post in 1995). All four marriages ended in annulment or divorce.She is survived by two sons, Michael Benajam of Los Angeles and Jack Webb of Miami; three grandchildren; and a great-grandchild. Also surviving are Ms. Webb’s companion of 35 years, Jamie Stellos, and Mr. Stellos’s wife, Nancy.In recent years, Ms. Webb’s agency has concentrated on more wholesome clients, notably stars of reality shows like “Survivor” and “The Apprentice.” The scandal division closed several years ago, Ms. Spillane said. (A former singer and actress who was a client of Ms. Webb’s, Ms. Spillane was once married to the crime novelist Mickey Spillane.)But even in its headier, tabloid days, the Ruth Webb Talent Agency observed a certain genteel propriety. Asked to represent O. J. Simpson, Ms. Spillane said, the agency politely declined.'"
"'06-12-17,'0','BuzzMetrics’ computer scientists and programmers, led by Sundar Kadayam, a 43-year-old software engineer, say they have developed sophisticated search engines to sweep the Internet and drill down into rich veins of extemporaneous word-of-mouth commentary and conversation found online.The search engines retrieve phrases, opinions, keywords, sentences and images, and the company runs the data through processing programs powerful enough to sift millions of messages simultaneously. By analyzing vocabulary, language patterns and phrasing, the programs determine whether comments are positive or negative, and whether the authors are men or women, young or old.“The days of sitting behind the focus-group wall are going the way of the buggy whip,” said Mike Nazzaro, BuzzMetrics’ president and chief operating officer. “We are fundamentally changing the way marketing and market research will be done in the future. We’re providing guidance to marketing decisions that was never possible.”BUZZMETRICS maintains that blogs and their attendant message boards and forums are tuning forks for consumer sentiment that threaten to upend traditional branding efforts. An influential blogger can undermine a brand faster than any grapevine ever before encountered in the marketplace, as the computer maker Dell discovered. The company’s level of service and quality was denounced by bloggers this year, and the complaints found broad exposure when one popular media site added its critical voice.At the same time, positive word of mouth magnified by the Internet can be a boon, as Toyota discovered with its hybrid Prius sedan, which has been praised by admirers on sites created just for that purpose.“There are winners and losers,” said Paul M. Rand, a partner and the global chief development and innovation officer at Ketchum Public Relations. “Companies adapt or go to the bottom. Consumer-generated content on the Internet is a complete disruptor. It forces companies to work smarter and listen harder.”Marketing executives, awakened to both the threat and the potential, are scrambling to harness data culled online. BuzzMetrics, a pioneer in trolling for brand awareness on the Web, is still a tiny company: it says its revenue for 2006 will be about $20 million. For now, it occupies a sweet spot in a promising new industry, but should search giants like Google move more aggressively into its market, BuzzMetrics may find the going tougher.“Search is at the core of everything Google does and we are more committed to improving search than ever before,” a Google spokesman said in an e-mail message. “We will continue to innovate our search technology to provide users with the fastest and most relevant search experience on the Web.”For the time being, say analysts at Forrester Research and Jupiter Research, BuzzMetrics is at the front of its field. In a report published in September, Peter Kim, a Forrester analyst, said that brand monitoring appears poised for enormous expansion as companies shift priorities and resources in the $12-billion-a-year market research business. Emily Riley, an advertising analyst at Jupiter, predicts that companies will double spending on brand monitoring in 2007.Among BuzzMetrics’ competitors are Umbria, based in Denver; Cymfony, in Watertown, Mass.; BrandIntel, in Toronto; Biz360 in San Mateo, Calif.; and MotiveQuest, in Chicago.While their specific approaches vary slightly, all use some form of Web search engine, analysis programs and human analysts to help organize data and provide a narrative that clients can understand, Ms. Riley said. Their ultimate goal, she said, is “to find out the deep thoughts of consumers and help clients understand what’s happening in their markets.”Both Mr. Kim and Ms. Riley said the old methods for keeping track of consumer sentiment, measuring the competition and improving advertising were in rapid transition. Traditional media are fragmenting. Focus groups are expensive, constrained and slow. New research shows that consumers are eager to evade advertising on television, block pop-up ads on the Internet and sign up for “do not call” lists to bar telephone solicitations.At the same time, new surveys show that 90 percent of consumers trust word-of-mouth suggestions, and that some make purchases based on such guidance. “Consumer-created content is still new enough that it’s much more influential at driving brand awareness than driving purchases,” said Ms. Riley, the Jupiter analyst. “People who read about something on a blog will generally do some further research, either by asking friends or through a search engine, for example, before forming their opinion,” she said.“We’re brand radar,” said Pete Blackshaw, 42, a former brand manager and Internet marketer at Procter & Gamble who is now BuzzMetrics’ chief marketing officer. “You can’t fly a plane without radar.”Among the growing number of BuzzMetrics’ fans is Bruce C. Ertmann, corporate manager for consumer-generated media at Toyota Motor Sales in Torrance, Calif. “Toyota is rebalancing how it engages its customers and its markets,” said Mr. Ertmann, who is 49 and has worked for Toyota for 23 years. “BuzzMetrics is helping us understand what’s happening.”Around Thanksgiving, for example, the Lexus division of Toyota ran a series of new holiday television commercials, one of which featured two men, a new car in the driveway with a huge red bow on its roof, and dialogue that seemed to indicate that the men lived together and that one had given the car to the other.Some viewers were struck by what they saw as a television spot directed at the gay market and complained to the automaker. Lexus executives responded that the ad was not aimed at the gay market — but the company, unnerved by the nature of the complaints and by research showing that the commercial was weak in terms of brand recall, dropped the ad.Mr. Ertmann said that Toyota, protective of its reputation and wary of controversy, was essentially reacting instinctively and taking action without evaluating all the information that became available. After it hired BuzzMetrics to gauge consumers’ attitude on the matter, it discovered that most viewers — especially the young urban and suburban consumers who write and read blogs and could buy Lexus vehicles — were pleased with the Lexus ad.“A decision had been made to pull that ad from the rotation, and that decision was made before we had a chance to gather the BuzzMetrics analysis and report it back to Lexus,” Mr. Ertmann said. “I was disappointed that Lexus did not wait for this cutting-edge intelligence.”Other companies have also turned to BuzzMetrics for advice. TechRepublic, a unit of CNET Networks, and publisher of a Web site for information technology professionals, has used the company’s services to track technology trends. ConAgra, the food giant that makes Pam cooking spray, Reddi-wip topping and Healthy Choice prepared meals, has used BuzzMetrics to anticipate lifestyle and dieting trends. Sony’s online entertainment group tapped the company to help it track interest in computer games, and Coca-Cola has used BuzzMetrics to gauge responses to a short comedic film posted on YouTube.The headquarters of Nielsen BuzzMetrics are in the Greenwich Village office of the American arm of its parent, VNU, a media company based in the Netherlands. Smaller research and development divisions are in Pittsburgh and Tel Aviv. But about 40 percent of its staff of 120 and many managers are in Cincinnati.BuzzMetrics offers a range of services and products to suit the new rules of marketing. One report, costing $20,000 or more, tells companies what their customers are saying on the Internet and what that means for their brand and markets. It also sells its proprietary search software and database, BrandPulse, to companies that want to use their own staffs to monitor such content.THIS service costs from $80,000 to $500,000, depending on how many of the client’s employees will use the database and search engine, the number of brands and competitors covered and the specific information sought. The Cincinnati office is led by former executives of two companies founded here during the Internet boom of the late 1990s.The first, PlanetFeedback, was started by Mr. Blackshaw and Mr. Nazzaro, now 40, a Harvard M.B.A. and former Procter & Gamble brand manager. The primary product of PlanetFeedback, which was financed by $31 million in venture capital, was a Web site intended to attract consumer opinions about products and services, and to earn revenue from advertisements.The second company, Intelliseek, which Mr. Kadayam helped to found, developed Internet search and information retrieval programs and software. In 2004, Intelliseek bought PlanetFeedback, combining the market, branding and Web expertise of the Blackshaw-Nazzaro team with Mr. Kadayam’s computer science background.Early last year, VNU invested in an Israeli research and development company, which then bought BuzzMetrics. With additional capital from VNU, BuzzMetrics bought Intelliseek and changed the name of the company to Nielsen BuzzMetrics.Now that it is generating steady revenue in brand monitoring, BuzzMetrics is considering how to use its media search and monitoring capabilities to expand into other markets such as politics.Mr. Kadayam recently projected on a large white screen the company’s most promising new tool, which he calls Floodgate. It is a program that displays in real time what people around the world are saying on thousands of blogs and message boards. The program shows each new message as a blinking green dot that fades to light blue and then vanishes after a few minutes. The program can cluster messages according to general themes, and track keywords and phrases and the full content of what the writer is saying.Click on any dot and the message appears in complete text in real time. A blogger from England writes about the ritual of putting her baby to bed. One from California celebrates buying a new computer game.Within a few minutes, the screen begins to look like the night sky, full of blue and green stars, all arranged by subject — an evolving constellation of the thoughts and desires that form the parameters of the new information universe.'"
"'06-12-17,'0','The City Council is expected to vote this week on a generous if arcane section of the property tax code known as 421-a. It’s about time. The law reduces property taxes for developers of apartment buildings in the city for as long as 25 years. It was born during the citywide depression of the 1970s to encourage construction, but that admirable rationale is no longer valid. Construction is booming, and while New York will certainly need new housing to accommodate a growing population, what it needs most of all is housing that people can afford. The law needs to be re-tailored to reflect that need.There are basically three proposals on the table. Despite differences in scope, all three proposals would revise a section of 421-a that requires developers in the hottest parts of town — so-called exclusion zones — to make 20 percent of their housing affordable to low-income people if they want the tax break. The exclusion zones are now largely confined to parts of Manhattan south of Harlem and parts of the Brooklyn waterfront.Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who got the reform ball rolling, has one bill. It would modestly expand the exclusion zones and make other changes, including capping the tax break for apartments with a value over $1 million. A much more aggressive bill sponsored by two council members — Annabel Palma of the Bronx and David Yassky of Brooklyn— would effectively make the entire city an exclusion zone. That proposal frightens smaller developers and lenders who believe that requiring everyone everywhere in the city to provide housing for low-income residents would make it uneconomical to build housing for moderate-income people, who are also being increasingly frozen out of the market.The third proposal, from Christine Quinn, the Council speaker, sits somewhere in the middle. Her proposal, which Mr. Bloomberg now supports, would double the exclusion zones in the mayor’s bill, cap the tax break for higher-priced housing at about $650,000, maximize reinvestment in city-created affordable housing and require regular reviews of the program.Although her bill might well be improved by the healthy debate now taking place in the council, it is more generous than the mayor’s original proposal and more flexible — and less threatening to the overall market — than the Palma-Yassky proposal.The current law expires at the end of 2007, but any reform bill will need approval in Albany, which could take a year. Whatever their differences, the 51 members of the council have an obligation to move quickly to update a law that confers undeserved benefits on developers of high-end housing while doing less and less for people who can barely afford to live here in the first place.'"
"'06-12-17,'0','With tax cuts for the rich, and the lower and middle classes bearing the burden of the war in Iraq, even public colleges and universities are becoming less of a viable option for millions of Americans. Until America figures out a way to make college a feasible option for every hard-working student, it will lag behind the pace of the rest of the world.I am disheartened after reading that institutions like Ursinus College and the University of Notre Dame set tuition prices, at least in part, based upon what other colleges charge. In the business world, one could call this collusion and price fixing, but apparently not in higher education.The notion that some schools must raise tuition to compete with their more expensive counterparts is not only doing a great disservice to young people but it’s also utterly ridiculous.If colleges and universities want more qualified applicants, they should increase advertising dollars and the budget of the office of admissions, and invest in resources that support a great learning environment for students, faculty and staff members.Your article rings a bell with me.In 1982, I published a book called “Cutting College Costs: A Parent’s Guide,” in which I suggested various strategies, one of which was finding a college less expensive than its peers.One of my nominees was Swarthmore, because it had been consistently less expensive than its Philadelphia area peers like the University of Pennsylvania, Haverford College and Bryn Mawr.Although I intended this as a compliment to Swarthmore, its officials apparently didn’t take it as such because almost overnight it became the most expensive of the four and remained so for years.It is not surprising that the perception of being a better college is linked to price.Indeed, as a ceramic artist, I recall years ago reading an article about a woman who couldn’t sell her mugs, plates and bowls at an art fair when they were priced between $8 and $12.When a friend told her to raise her prices, she reluctantly agreed to give it a try, and at her next show, she raised the prices to a range of $20 to $28 and sold out!The point is, people believe that “you get what you pay for” applies to all circumstances, leaving common sense in the dust.'"
"'06-12-17,'0','The MX has its drawbacks. For one, there is no version for lefties. And, even for a fancy mouse, it’s pricey: the suggested retail is $99.99. But many early adopters say that once they’ve used this hypermouse, they can’t go back to slower devices.Erik Khoobyarian, a lawyer in Sacramento who reviewed the mouse for Logitech before its release in August, now always has the MX at hand. “It’s a small change, but it’s made me more efficient,” he said of the mouse’s ability to scan quickly.He particularly values the MX when he is reading long cases or articles online. “The job goes a lot faster,” he said. He also uses it for speeding through spreadsheets. “I fly to the section I want,” he said, “and then scroll more slowly.”The mouse has another new feature he likes: a thumb-wheel mounted horizontally on the left side, meant for users who have many computer windows open at the same time. With a click, it shows a vertical list of, for instance, active Web pages, searches and e-mail; a nudge of the wheel takes him from one window to the next.“It’s a treat to use,” he said — quicker than typing “alt tab” on the keyboard, or clicking on tabs at the bottom of the screen.Richard McCowen, a research assistant professor of psychology at the University of Memphis, uses the MX, which he bought online at www.sparco.com, to zip through the thousands of lines of computer code that he writes as part of his job. “One of these pages can be 3,000 lines long,” he said.He lets the wheel spin freely, then scans the display to find the part of the code that concerns him. “Once I’m near the right spot,” he said, “I click to go into line-by-line mode.”There are more traditional ways to speed the trip through a document, including the age-old technique of pointing the cursor at the scroll bar on the side, grabbing an icon and pulling on it to move the screen vertically or horizontally.But that method entails a minor but steady interruption. “If you are editing, you have to move your gaze from the text to the side each time that you need to grab the scroll bar,” said Ravin Balakrishnan, an associate professor of computer science at the University of Toronto whose work includes research on computer interfaces. “Your visual attention is divided from the document.”Other scanning techniques are available. Microsoft’s AutoScroll function, for example, permits users to scroll quickly by pressing a control on the mouse and then sliding the mouse along the desktop.The Logitech mouse comes with software that buyers can use to customize the controls — for example, the speed or acceleration of horizontal or vertical scrolling, or the number of lines shown with each click. The software also allows users to reassign the functions of most of the controls. For instance, one button on the mouse lets users begin a search of any highlighted word or phrase with one touch — but it works only on Google, Yahoo, or Yahoo LiveWords. If this isn’t useful, users can reassign the one-touch button to one of many other functions.The MX is cordless and operates up to a distance of about 30 feet. It has a rechargeable lithium-ion battery and a built-in laser. The laser illuminates the surface beneath the mouse so that each of its movements can be photographed and sent on to the computer, even on tricky surfaces like high-gloss wood veneer.Installation is simple. First, the mouse is placed into its charger for a few hours so the battery will be ready to go. Then it’s just a matter of moments to install the software, which is in the box for PCs and is downloadable on the Web for Macs. The wireless receiver that picks up the transmissions from the mouse plugs into an available USB port on the computer.A brief set of instructions explains the new controls, like the main scroll wheel, the thumb wheel and the one-touch button. If you want to customize the controls or learn about the more standard functions of the mouse, you’ll find the information only on the software guide, which takes 10 minutes, or perhaps slightly longer, to read.Other cordless laser mice are on the market. They include Microsoft’s Wireless Laser Mouse 8000 ($75 to $90), introduced in September. The 8000 does not have a hyperspeed scroll wheel like the MX’s, but can be operated easily by both left- and right-handers. It is not compatible with Macs, whereas the MX works with both Macs and PCs.The MX is not designed for true game fans, said Erik Charlton, senior product manager at Logitech. During idle periods, the mouse “sleeps,” or reduces the stream of images it customarily transmits to the computer. This sleeping prolongs battery life, but results in a tiny lag when the resting mouse is put back into motion. Such lags might give pause to a gamer suddenly pursued by a monster, Mr. Charlton said.But the mouse does have one gaming feature incorporated into its desktop persona: low-friction feet that are coated in a generic version of Teflon. The feet glide extremely smoothly and rapidly over a desktop.Even users whose monsters come in the form of 40-page reports should find this nearly frictionless movement a constant pleasure.'"

"'06-12-17,'0','As Albany prepares for what is being promised as the newer, cleaner Eliot Spitzer administration, you do not have to be much of a cynic to wonder if the regulars in New York State’s government can find a way not to clean up their acts.One possibility would be for the lawmakers to define what they are already doing as ethical. We know that what they’re doing is mostly legal — even the most scandalous behavior, whether it’s misusing campaign funds or drawing districts to ensure lifetime employment, is technically legal mainly because they have done nothing to make it illegal.Another way to avoid reform is to make certain that the people overseeing things do not see much of anything bad around them. That is the way they do it in Washington. But even in Albany, a few officials try to hold our public servants and their very rich friends up to public scrutiny.One is David Grandeau, executive director of the New York Temporary State Commission on Lobbying. The commission is in business to oversee Albany’s lobbyists and to make sure that they obey the law when dealing with legislators and state government.In carrying out that charge, Mr. Grandeau has infuriated almost every bigwig in Albany, mostly to his credit.Originally promoted for the job by Joseph Bruno, the Senate majority leader, Mr. Grandeau and his agency have been investigating the questionable way a lobbyist has provided Mr. Bruno with a private plane. Mr. Grandeau, who can be combative and argumentative, also investigated a deal the Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver, got on a very expensive hotel room in Las Vegas. He once locked horns with Attorney General Spitzer over the future of the lobbying law and neither man has ever forgotten it.'"

Recess provides a time for children to decompress.If more research is needed, I’d suggest studying the negative effects of reduced recess, the decline in children’s unstructured time, and the increased driving of our kids, who seldom walk and enjoy that activity’s aerobic benefits.Whatever happened to children walking to and from school and playing outside before or after school? The loss of a true recess may be the third strike.The Gas Plant: Is It Worth the Risks?Whether based on science or common sense, criticisms of the Broadwater Energy proposal for a liquefied gas terminal in Long Island Sound are well reasoned.Rather than being analyzed in a vacuum, the effects of the Broadwater plan should be examined together with those of other proposed industrial activities or as a potential precedent.Given the likelihood that the project could pave the way for other industrial uses that could worsen the cumulative adverse effects on the Sound, is it worth the risk?And given the fact that the project would increase our reliance on foreign fossil fuel, thereby reducing the region’s energy security and increasing the potential for price volatility, is it worth the risk?Wouldn’t it be better to keep the billions of dollars that would be siphoned out of the region by Broadwater here, to be invested in renewable energy, energy conservation and efficiency?

Why would you deny society’s only recourse to keep sexual predators off the streets when the legal system fails us and hands down lenient sentences?We are far from doling out sentences that adequately address the dangers these perpetrators pose to society, so I find it misguided to advocate on the behalf of sex offenders instead of looking at the care and treatment of victims and the rest of society.'"
"'06-12-17,'0','Neither of them, though, was the grandson of a former slave, or the son of a waiter at one of the university’s eating clubs, as Mr. Hinds was. Neither of them helped pave Nassau Street when it was still a dirt road, or drove a horse-drawn carriage to Princeton Junction to pick up train passengers, or shined the shoes of the town’s swells, or pumped the pipe organ at Mount Pisgah A.M.E. Church, or exterminated the carpenter ants in the lumber that Palmer Square was built from, or attended the same segregated grammar school as Paul Robeson, or played end for the Princeton High football team, or graduated from Talladega College in Alabama, or ran recreation programs at local playgrounds and the old Colored Y.M.C.A., or served on the zoning board for 20 years, or, well into his 90s, led calisthenics classes for the elderly members of his church.“Any part of Princeton, Mr. Hinds had something to do with it,” said Ms. Satterfield, a retired guidance counselor whose grandmother taught Mr. Robeson and who lives across the street from her old grammar school.She first floated the idea of naming something for Mr. Hinds at his 100th birthday celebration. “And then at his memorial service, I said it again,” she said. When she did, she recalled, the sanctuary at Mount Pisgah — where his old shoeshine box sat in a place of honor that day — rang with applause.She plans to make her case to the Borough Council in January. Princeton Future — a nonprofit community group whose board she serves on — endorsed the idea at a recent meeting.“He is certainly so deserving to be remembered publicly in some kind of way,” said Mildred Trotman, a 20-year council veteran who was selected as the borough’s first African-American mayor in 2005. “But I have no idea how the council will react to such a request.”Ms. Satterfield said she would like to see a plaque on the plaza that remembers Mr. Hinds, and, by extension, a community that is often forgotten. “I have to say that there is a general feeling that the intention has been to move us out, so that the town can be lily-white,” Mr. Hinds said several years ago in an interview with Sheldon Sturges, a co-founder of Princeton Future.And that was why whenever Ms. Satterfield called — whenever she had a tour to lead, a talk to give, a slide show to present — he came along, even after he needed a walker.“It used to be that the only time white people came into our neighborhood was to come to the hospital or to pick up the people who worked for them,” she said. “It’s like there’s no other history in Princeton other than Einstein or Drumthwacket or whatever.”She was turning another corner now, after pointing out the barber, the old grocery, the Masonic temple, the house where the Robesons lived, the segregated cemetery and then a defunct men’s club. “It was ‘Colored Men’ spelled backwards,” Ms. Satterfield said and then tried, unsuccessfully, to pronounce it correctly.“I’m not sure. Mr. Hinds knows it,” she said, slipping and referring to him in the present tense, which is where she wants him to stay.'"
"'06-12-17,'0','I dread this season, these weeks before Christmas in Beirut. I was 18 in December 1988, during the height of the Lebanese Civil War, and I was to be married on Christmas Day. But it didn’t happen that way.I met my fiancé, Emile, at my cousin’s house, but we never spoke. I was only 15 and too shy. And at first, when my cousin told my father that Emile wanted to ask for my hand, my father said I was too young. But my parents invited Emile home, and he started to spend time with us, and I found that I loved Emile from the bottom of my heart. My parents said we had to wait until after I finished high school to marry, but graduation day finally came. And that fall, an unusually dry, windy fall, we started to get ready for the wedding.A week before the ceremony, Emile disappeared. We called the company where he worked, and they said he’d left for the day, and his mother said he hadn’t returned home. After a few days we could only assume that he’d been shot or kidnapped by one of the Christian militias that were fighting one another then. Emile was only 23, and he had never been politically active, but during those days many people became the victims of misdirected acts of retribution and violence.I can’t describe the devastation I felt. During the next three months, the fighting in Beirut got much worse, and my family had to move to a safer area. Even if Emile’s family had news of him, they would not have been able to inform us. The battles were terrible, Beirut’s neighborhoods were isolated from one another and there was no telephone and no electricity. People were simply stuck where they were. My family was convinced that Emile was dead. Still, he would come to me in my dreams, saying, “Wait for me.” When you are very scared and you feel you have nothing to live for, you start to search your dreams for hope.When the war ended and reconstruction began, I continued my studies and worked very hard, and I tried not to show my parents how much I was suffering. Over the years, from time to time, I heard rumors about Emile. Some said he died. Others said he was in Syria. Some said that he’d been liberated and had married someone else. There was no way to find out for sure.'"
"'06-12-17,'0','Look no further than Anderson for the high price of a 400-carry season. In 1998, he amassed 1,846 yards from those 410 carries and helped lift his team to the Super Bowl. But the next season, he played in only two games because of injuries, and he never exceeded 300 carries again. By 2002, he was out of the N.F.L.Johnson could be courting the same fate. Chiefs Coach Herman Edwards, when asked about Johnson’s workload after the team’s win over the Broncos on Nov. 23, told reporters: “I’m not going to wear him out. That’s what good runners want. They want the ball.”When pressed further, he said: “He wants the ball that many times. It’s not like he’s walking around here saying, ‘I’m carrying the ball too much.’ ”Twenty running backs have carried the ball 375 or more times in a season, and as a whole their carries the next season dropped by 34.1 percent. The number is even higher for the four who have carried the ball more than 400 times, with their total dropping 39.5 percent the next season.When asked why a top running back would be used to such an extent, Giants running back Tiki Barber said: “I think it’s one of two things. From a team perspective, it’s almost as if, ‘We’re not guaranteed to have him healthy all the time, so let’s get our use out of him.’ But that’s almost congruent to the player’s perspective because you think, ‘I could be out of the game or hurt tomorrow; let me do as much as I can now.’ ”Johnson’s former coach, Dick Vermeil, showed atypical restraint with the number of carries his star runners received. In his career, Vermeil worked with Wilbert Montgomery, Marshall Faulk, Priest Holmes and Johnson and yet had just five seasons in which his top running back had more than 300 carries, with Priest Holmes accounting for three of them.Although he rarely overworked running backs, he said coaches were making the right decision by sticking with their starter.“If you’ve already clinched your division and the best playoff position, then you can afford to take your best players out,” Vermeil said. “But until you do that, you have to keep them in there playing to do everything you can to enhance your playoff position.”There seems to be little concern that a player can’t be replaced. As Barber recalled, “One of my running backs coaches used to joke that they should put a sign outside of our locker room saying, ‘Hiring all positions.’ ”Barber, who carried the ball 357 times last season and caught 54 passes, said, “At the end of the year, my body was the worst it had ever felt and that was one of the reasons why I really started contemplating retirement.”One obvious way to reduce the workload for starting running backs is to increase the number of carries given to backups. In the case of the Chargers, with Tomlinson and the backup Michael Turner, or the Jaguars, with the starter Fred Taylor and the backup Maurice Jones-Drew, that combination works well, but it is not generally popular with coaches or players.“I always felt that when you take your starting running back out of the ballgame, more often than not you’re shifting into second gear,” Vermeil said. “You never know what play is going to be the big play for the great running back. But if he’s on the bench, you know he’s not going to make it.”A second way to reduce the workload would be to limit carries in garbage time.In a Nov. 5 game against the Rams, Johnson had 27 carries for 172 yards and a touchdown. With the team leading, 31-17, in the fourth quarter, and 1 minute 48 seconds to play, Johnson took the field for the final drive and ran the ball three times for a total of six yards.“There is some level of pride or prestige to lead the league in rushing or have a 200-yard day instead of a 180-yard day,” Barber said. “So you take those extra five carries and it all combines into an increasing number of carries on the season.”Vermeil, now an analyst for the NFL Network, does not understand the motivations of a coach who allows his player to risk injury for personal gain. He said, “I know in the same situation more often than not I would have my key guy on the bench.”Barber says it’s a mind-set that is not going to change anytime soon. “Every year somebody new comes in or a potential new star is there and so you have to live for now,” he said.Barber recalled a situation in 2000, when he was injured in the second-to-last week of the season and found out a week later that he had broken his arm. Facing surgery, he told the doctors to wait so he could help his team’s Super Bowl chances. He played with the broken arm and the team reached the Super Bowl, losing to the Ravens.“People have said, ‘Wow, you played with a broken arm, you must be brave,’ ” he said, laughing. “Well, I’m either brave or stupid. At the time I was brave, in retrospect I was stupid. Because of the mentality that it takes to play this game, you do stupid stuff because you want to win. Your pride takes over and it squashes all reason.”'"
"'06-12-17,'0','One answer is provided in a theory from Andrei Shleifer, an economics professor at Harvard, and Robert W. Vishny, a finance professor at the University of Chicago. They discussed their idea in an article titled “Stock Market Driven Acquisitions” in the December 2003 issue of the Journal of Financial Economics. A copy is at post.economics.harvard.edu/faculty/shleifer/papers/StockMarketDrivenAcquisitionsF.pdf.The professors argue that if the target company’s managers have a short time horizon, they will be willing to sell their company for stock even when they suspect it to be overvalued. These managers may be ready to retire, for example, or have options or stock they are anxious to sell. Because these managers can quickly unload the stock of the acquiring company that they receive in the deal, they may have little concern that it’s overvalued and unattractive from a longer-term point of view.Another theory was proposed by Professor Rhodes-Kropf and S. Viswanathan, a finance professor at Duke, in an article they wrote in the December 2004 issue of the Journal of Finance titled “Market Valuation and Merger Waves.” (A copy of the study is at www0.gsb.columbia.edu/faculty/mrhodeskropf/joffinal5.pdf).According to this theory, a target company’s managers can’t determine in advance whether a high-priced offer reflects real synergies of the potentially combined company or the overpricing of the acquirer’s shares. Professor Rhodes-Kropf says this means that we shouldn’t be surprised by the number of acquisitions that occur during periods when — from the benefit of hindsight — stocks appeared to be overvalued.BECAUSE both of these academic theories focus on deals financed with stock, they apply only partially to the current merger wave, much of which has been paid for with cash raised through debt financing. (This undoubtedly reflects the fact that debt is so cheap right now, Professor Shleifer said.)Professor Rhodes-Kropf cautions stock-market investors not to take solace in that difference. “To the extent the current merger wave reflects an overvalued debt market, it stands to reason that it will eventually correct — just as overvalued stock markets eventually correct,” he said. “And it can’t be good news for the stock market if money is destined to become much tighter in coming years.”The bottom line is this: The current merger wave means that stocks are probably closer to the overvalued end of the spectrum than to the opposite extreme, and that they also are vulnerable to tighter money in coming years.This doesn’t necessarily mean that stocks will fall in the near future. But it does imply that their prospects are well below average.'"
"'06-12-17,'0','“I walk outside and can see 30 stars, like Orion, but also flashbulbs popping at the Empire State Building,” said Mr. Vogt, who works for the Postal Service in Parkchester. “It gives me a sense of peace.”He also unwinds by strolling over the Henry Hudson Bridge to Manhattan’s 196-acre Inwood Hill Park, where he enjoys exploring for old ruins now overtaken by tulip trees.“You can be in a rustic area in about five minutes,” Mr. Vogt said. “That’s what makes this place so unique.”His co-op is called the Blue Building for its distinctively colored glass-brick curtain wall; growing up nearby in Kingsbridge in the 1960s, he watched it being built. His apartment, which has one bedroom, one bath and 900 square feet of space plus a terrace, cost $65,000 in 1999, he said, adding that it is probably worth around $250,000 today.According to local brokers, the Blue Building is one of many built here about 50 years ago and marketed to people living in Art Deco apartments on the Grand Concourse in the Bronx, who were then seeking newer, larger spaces.Many of these first-generation Spuyten Duyvilers still live here, statistics show. The typical resident below West 232nd Street — about four blocks north of Spuyten Duyvil’s upper boundary — is 52, according to the 2000 census. That is considerably older than the median age of the city as a whole, 34.Yet the makeup may be changing. “We are at a time of transition here,” said Ellen Feld, an associate broker with Susan Goldy Real Estate. “I’m showing it to more young single people and young married couples.”One such couple were Adam and Lan-Huang Scheinbach, who decided to look in Spuyten Duyvil two years ago despite Mr. Scheinbach’s perception of an aged population, gleaned from his childhood memories of growing up next door in Riverdale.At the time, the couple had decided to have children and knew that their one-bedroom rental in Midtown Manhattan was too small for a family. They also considered Brooklyn, but Mr. Scheinbach would have had to take the subway to his job in Manhattan, where he works as a lawyer.He much prefers above-ground trains. “They’re predictable,” he said. “You’re never at the whim of the train operator like on the subway. And cruising along the river is so much better than dealing with grinding metal noises underground.”The couple found a two-bedroom, two-bath co-op, with 1,500 square feet of space, in the Winston Churchill, a 20-story luxury building on 2500 Johnson Avenue. In 2004 his apartment cost $340,000. But he estimates that today, with the renovated kitchen and refinished floors, it would fetch $440,000.Spuyten Duyvil’s architecture is mostly enormous co-op buildings, with hotel-style porte-cochères, cleanly landscaped hedges, indoor pools and basement parking.Yet in the mix here and there are reminders of what Spuyten Duyvil probably looked like when developers arrived after World War II: wood-frame homes in the Italianate and Foursquare styles, tucked among the large buildings along Edsall Avenue where it joins Johnson Avenue. There is also the occasional Mediterranean-type villa, with a steeply pitched terra-cotta roof.There are only two condominium buildings: La Rive, at 2521 Palisade Avenue, which was built in the 1980s; and Riverpointe, the new name of the Waterview, a former rental building at 2287 Johnson Avenue.New construction is “probably not as much of a threat in Spuyten Duyvil as in Riverdale,” said Anthony Perez Cassino, chairman of Bronx Community Board 8, citing Spuyten Duyvil’s relative petiteness. A zoning change enacted in 2004 keeps developers from exceeding current building heights (roughly 20 stories).“But if the market is right,” Mr. Cassino said, “developers will find ways to build something. We just want them to respect what’s there.”Spuyten Duyvil may be side by side with Manhattan, but its prices seem more Bronxlike.A two-bedroom, two-bath 1,200-square-foot co-op — the most common housing unit — typically costs $550,000, plus $1,100 a month in maintenance fees to cover round-the-clock doormen and pool cleaning.Yet larger units exist, and they tend to move quickly. A three-bedroom, two-bath co-op, with 1,500 square feet of space, hardwood floors and an enclosed terrace, in River Terrace Apartments at 2621 Palisade Avenue, sold for $950,000 this summer in just a month, according to Linda Justus, an associate broker with Robert E. Hill Inc., who has been selling homes in Spuyten Duyvil for more than 20 years.Prices here have climbed about 10 percent a year for the last three years, Ms. Justus said, asserting that even if the market has eased recently, with more protracted negotiating and fewer multiple offers on homes, demand is stronger in Spuyten Duyvil than Riverdale.“There are really not many buildings like those along Palisade Avenue,” she said. “People love those views.”The current spelling of Spuyten Duyvil (pronounced SPY-tun DY-vul) is probably the most complicated of the 14 that have been used since the area took its name from a turbulent local creek — which was filled in in the late 1890s and rerouted slightly farther south as the Harlem River Ship Canal. (In fact, before that change, Marble Hill, the enclave just east of Spuyten Duyvil, was geographically separated from the Bronx by the creek.)Previous iterations of this Dutch name — inspired by treacherous waters — have included “In Spite of the Devil,” “Spilling Devil” and “Speak Devil,” according to research by the city’s Parks Department.The days are mostly past when freighters from Buffalo, bound for Brooklyn’s piers with cargos of iron ore and wheat, travel the canal. But the Columbia University crew, which stores its shells at a new boathouse on the opposite bank, turns up from time to time.What to DoThe Knolls Crescent shopping area, which residents call the Knolls, has a few shops in a small strip, including a wine store, dry cleaner, bank and pharmacy.On a recent afternoon, one of the area’s two markets had pineapples, pomegranates and persimmons displayed outside in baskets. Those who like to shop at supermarkets typically drive to South Riverdale or Kingsbridge, although some say they order groceries online.The Knolls also has a few restaurants — among them a diner and a Thai restaurant — and nearby upper Johnson Avenue offers Japanese and Chinese options.Children make full use of Paul’s Park, a section of Henry Hudson Park with climbing equipment and a sandbox, presided over by a verdigris statue of the park’s namesake, atop a large classical column.The Spuyten Duyvil School at 660 West 236th Street, which teaches kindergarten through Grade 5, has consistently produced some of the top scores in the Bronx on state tests. In the last academic year, for example, 89 percent of the fourth graders scored at or above grade level in English and 93 percent in math. In the Bronx as a whole, the numbers were 50 percent in English and 60 percent in math.Next month, administrators said, the school will begin testing students for placement in a new gifted program to start in the fall, joining 137 of 597 similar-size schools citywide.Somewhat unusually, Spuyten Duyvil’s middle and high schools are combined. Middle School/High School 141, also known as the David A. Stein Riverdale/Kingsbridge Academy, covers Grades 6 through 12; in the 2004-2005 year, the student body numbered 1,126.That year the median on the math SAT was 448, on the verbal 441. Statewide, the medians were 511 and 497.Metro-North trains from Spuyten Duyvil station leave about three times an hour in the morning rush, and take about 20 minutes to get to Grand Central Terminal. The railroad coordinates connecting bus service, for an extra $2, along three routes in the western Bronx.Two express buses also run to Midtown on trips that typically last about 40 minutes.Though the subway stop at West 231st Street is too far to the east for most residents, the No. 1 train does run along Broadway into Manhattan.What We LikeThe environment of Spuyten Duyvil is a testament to engineering, from its realigned waterways to its well-sited bridges, from its stairs hewn out of rock to its buildings delicately balanced on ridge tops.Most Knolls vendors are closed by 10 p.m., which may be too early for a younger generation discovering Spuyten Duyvil, many of them relocating from Manhattan, where restaurants typically stay open late.The neighborhood does not offer much in the way of nightlife, either; some brokers worry that buyers may find the area too suburban.“I don’t like to use the S-word in describing this place,” said Ellen Feld, of Susan Goldy Real Estate, “because it upsets people.”Even if it means giving up all-night delis to move here, Ms. Feld said, “the tradeoff is worth it.”'"

A failure in Iraq would haunt the United States “for decades to come,” he said.Nor can the United States afford to neglect Afghanistan, where progress in the post-Taliban era is “at risk,” Mr. Gates said.

Before the Taliban was overthrown in the American-led military campaign of 2001, Afghanistan was a host for Al Qaeda terrorists.'"
"'06-12-18,'0','“I think he’s an excellent teacher,” said the school principal, Al Somma. “As far as I know, there have never been any problems in the past.”Staci Snider, the president of the local teacher’s union, said Mr. Paszkiewicz (pronounced pass-KEV-ich) had been assigned a lawyer from the union, the New Jersey Education Association. Two calls to Mr. Paszkiewicz at school and one to his home were not returned.In this tale of the teacher who preached in class and the pupil he offended, students and the larger community have mostly lined up with Mr. Paszkiewicz, not with Matthew, who has received a death threat handled by the police, as well as critical comments from classmates.Greice Coelho, who took Mr. Paszkiewicz’s class and is a member of his youth group, said in a letter to The Observer, the local weekly newspaper, that Matthew was “ignoring the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, which gives every citizen the freedom of religion.” Some anonymous posters on the town’s electronic bulletin board, Kearnyontheweb.com, called for Matthew’s suspension.On the sidewalks outside the high school, which has 1,750 students, many agreed with 15-year-old Kyle Durkin, who said, “I’m on the teacher’s side all the way.”While science teachers, particularly in the Bible Belt, have been known to refuse to teach evolution, the controversy here, 10 miles west of Manhattan, hinges on assertions Mr. Paszkiewicz made in class, including how a specific Muslim girl would go to hell.“This is extremely rare for a teacher to get this blatantly evangelical,” said the Rev. Barry W. Lynn, executive director of Americans United for Separation of Church and State, a nonprofit educational association. “He’s really out there proselytizing, trying to convert students to his faith, and I think that that’s more than just saying I have some academic freedom right to talk about the Bible’s view of creation as well as evolution.”Even some legal organizations that often champion the expression of religious beliefs are hesitant to support Mr. Paszkiewicz.“It’s proselytizing, and the courts have been pretty clear you can’t do that,” said John W. Whitehead, president of the Rutherford Institute, a group that provides legal services in religious freedom cases. “You can’t step across the line and proselytize, and that’s what he’s done here.”The class started on Sept. 11, and Matthew quickly grew concerned. “The first couple of days I had him, he had already begun discussing his religious point of view,” Matthew, a thin, articulate 16-year-old with braces and a passion for politics and the theater, recalled in an interview. “It wasn’t even just his point of view, it went beyond that to say this is the right way, this is the only way. The way he said it, I wasn’t sure how far he was going to go.”On the second day of taping, after the discussion veered from Moses’s education to free will, Matthew asked why a loving God would consign humans to hell, according to the recording.Some of Matthew’s detractors say he set up his teacher by baiting him with religious questions. But Matthew, who was raised in the Ethical Culture Society, a humanist religious and educational group, said all of his comments were in response to something the teacher said.“I didn’t start any of the topics that were discussed,” he said.In a Sept. 25 letter to the principal, Matthew wrote: “I care about the future generation and I do not want Mr. Paszkiewicz to continue preaching to and poisoning students.” He met with school officials and handed over the recordings.Matthew’s family wrote four letters to the district asking for an apology and for the teacher to correct any false statements he had made in class, particularly those related to science. Matthew’s father, Paul LaClair, a lawyer, said he was now considering legal action against the district, claiming that Mr. Paszkiewicz’s teachings violated their son’s First Amendment and civil rights, and that his words misled the class and went against the curriculum.Kenneth J. Lindenfelser, the lawyer for the Kearny school board, said he could not discuss Mr. Paszkiewicz specifically, but that when a complaint comes in about a teacher, it is investigated, and then the department leader works with the teacher to correct any inappropriate behavior.The teacher is monitored, and his or her evaluation could be noted, Mr. Lindenfelser said, adding that if these steps did not work, the teacher could be reprimanded, suspended or, eventually, fired.As for the request that Mr. Paszkiewicz correct his statements that conflict with the district’s science curriculum, “Sometimes, the more you dwell on the issue, the more you continue the issue,” Mr. Lindenfelser said. “Sometimes, it’s better to stop any inappropriate behavior and move on.”The district’s actions have succeeded, he said, as the family has not reported any continued violations.Bloggers around the world have called Matthew courageous. In contrast, the LaClairs said they had been surprised by the vehemence of the opposition that local residents had expressed against Matthew.Frank Viscuso, a Kearny resident, wrote in a letter to The Observer that “when a student is advised by his ‘attorney’ father to bait a teacher with questions about religion, and then records his answers and takes the story to 300 newspapers, that family isn’t ‘offended’ by what was said in the classroom — they’re simply looking for a payout and to make a name for themselves.” He called the teacher one of the town’s best.However, Andrew Lewczuk, a former student of Mr. Paszkiewicz, praised his abilities as a history teacher but said he regretted that he had not protested the religious discussions. “In the end, the manner in which Mr. Paszkiewicz spoke with his students was careless, inconsiderate and inappropriate,” he wrote to The Observer. “It was an abuse of power and influence, and it’s my own fault that I didn’t do anything about this.”One teacher, who did not give his name, said he thought both Matthew and his teacher had done the right thing. “The student had the right to do what he did,” the man said. As for Mr. Paszkiewicz, “He had the right to say what he said, he was not preaching, and that’s something I’m very much against.”Matthew said he missed the friends he had lost over his role in the debate, and said he could “feel the glares” when he walked into school.Instead of mulling Supreme Court precedents, he said with half a smile, “I should be worrying about who I’m going to take to the prom.”'"
"'06-12-18,'0','Re “Congress and the Benefits of Sunshine” (editorial, Dec. 14):Ironically, the Internet has revolutionized the availability of information for almost all of our nation’s institutions except the one designed to be the most public and accountable: government.The current laws under the Freedom of Information Act are hopelessly dated and make it practically impossible for citizens to gather the most basic of information about what their representatives are doing in Washington.Congress has always exempted itself from public disclosure laws. But if it is serious about reform, Congress, like all other federal agencies, should finally resolve to play by the same rules. At the least, all written communications and scheduled meetings between members of Congress and registered lobbyists should be subject to public review.Moreover, all documents that the public has a right to see should be accessible on the Web.Unfortunately, the administration — by interpreting freedom of information laws narrowly and making delay or denial of appropriate requests official policy — has made a transparent government that enables true citizen oversight and engagement an even more distant goal.'"
"'06-12-18,'0','“We remain optimistic, we remain hopeful,” Capt. Mike Braibish of the Oregon National Guard told reporters after the body was found. “We continue to proceed with this as a rescue for the two remaining climbers.”The search was slowed by weather that battered much of the Pacific Northwest. On Thursday and Friday, a storm brought wind gusts over 80 miles per hour outside Seattle and over 110 m.p.h. in the Cascade Mountains and in Oregon’s Coast Range, knocking out power to more than one million homes and businesses. At least four people died and dozens more were sickened from carbon monoxide from grills used to cook inside and generators used for power.On Sunday, as live television images of rescue helicopters hovering over snow-capped Mount Hood riveted viewers across the country, hundreds of thousands of people in western Washington and Oregon remained without power and heat — and without the expectation of getting them back soon.Power company officials said it could be several more days before power was restored to many places outside Seattle, including heavily wooded towns like North Bend, Carnation and Woodinville, which have grown quickly in recent years.Puget Sound Energy, the main electric utility for areas east of Seattle, said on Sunday night that 200,000 customers in the region remained without power, out of about 700,000 that had lost it. Grant Ringel, a utility spokesman, said huge Douglas fir trees that had been downed severely damaged power lines.“When you’re flying over the area in an airplane, you barely see that it’s populated because the trees are so thick and big,” Mr. Ringel said.In North Bend, Wash., about 30 miles east of Seattle in the shadow of jagged Mount Si and the Cascades, the main grocery story was operating on generator power and many people had left for shelter elsewhere. Many who stayed said they did not expect power to be restored soon.“You should be here at night,” said Theresa Callahan, 24, who had stayed in her apartment with her daughter, Adreanna Rasmussen, 9, and her fiancé, keeping a fire going in the fireplace and blocking off doorways to other rooms with blankets. “It’s such an eerie thing, because it’s pitch black.”Across the street, John Plantz was outside putting pork loin on the grill.“I had Italian sausage going earlier,” said Mr. Plantz, 41, who was hunkered down at home with his wife and 4-year-old son. “A friend of mine’s bringing me more propane from Tacoma.”Mr. Plantz had heard reports of carbon monoxide poisoning and said he was being careful with his gas grill, keeping it just outside the garage.On Saturday, at least 55 people were treated for carbon monoxide poisoning at Harborview Medical Center in Seattle, prompting public health officials to warn against using gas and kerosene heaters, charcoal grills or generators in their homes.In Oregon, the search for the climbers was frustrated by foul weather much of the week, peaking with the storm on Thursday and Friday. Rescuers initially hoped to make a major push on Saturday, after the worst of the winds passed, but had to wait until Sunday.The three climbers, all with many years of experience, began their ascent of Mount Hood on Dec. 8. Mr. James, 48, was accompanied by Brian Hall, 38, of Dallas, and Jerry Nikko Cooke, 36, of Brooklyn.Deputy Marc Smith of the Hood River County Sheriff’s Office said all the rescuers were off the mountain on Sunday night and would return early Monday to search for the other two men, “concentrating in the same area.”'"
"'06-12-18,'0','Herbert Gursky, a leading space researcher for the Navy who, in the 1960s, guided investigations that discovered the sources of X-rays arriving from outside the solar system, died Dec. 1 in Fairfax, Va. He was 76.The cause was stomach cancer, his family said.Until recently, Dr. Gursky, an astrophysicist, worked at the Systems Directorate of the Naval Research Laboratory in Washington overseeing experiments in solar physics and the preparation of satellites, telescopes and other sophisticated instruments launched to make observations in space.He had been acting associate director of research there.In the early 1960s, Dr. Gursky was a member of a pioneering scientific team at American Science and Engineering Inc., a private research company in Cambridge, Mass. The team, investigating X-rays and their sources in space, developed an X-ray detector, which they launched and then monitored.The device discovered a distant star in the constellation Scorpio emitting more X-rays than visible light. At the time, the Sun was the only confirmed source of X-rays in the upper atmosphere.In the following decades, X-rays and their stellar sources became important tools in navigation and in the timing of clocks and instruments carried on spacecraft. Dr. Gursky and others subsequently helped to locate Scorpio through an optical telescope and ultimately to determine its makeup as two stars in rapid orbit around each other.'"
"'06-12-18,'0','Imagine that, by one of life’s more serious vicissitudes, you had to serve as someone’s dog. Cheer up: you would do better than you think, at least at what might seem the hardest part of the job, tracking a scent.Researchers at the University of California, Berkeley, have found that people can follow a scent surprisingly well, as long as they do not mind abandoning all dignity, putting their nose right to the ground and crawling along with their bottoms in the air.But the achievement, as Samuel Johnson remarked in another context, is “like a dog’s walking on his hind legs. It is not done well; but you are surprised to find it done at all.”The researchers’ subjects, asked to track a chocolate scent across a meadow, inched along at a speed of, well, one inch a second. Though their pace accelerated to two inches a second after a few training sessions, it seems clear enough why trackers like the Bushmen of the Kalahari relied on eyesight to follow an animal’s trail.The researchers did not run a dog versus human competition because the dogs were in a different league, sometimes smelling a dragged target (a dead bird) from the starting line and making a beeline for it.The purpose of the experiment was to inquire whether having two nostrils spaced slightly apart helps track a scent, just as having two ears enables the brain to locate the source of a sound. But dogs cannot report what they are doing and object to procedures like having one nostril blocked. So the Berkeley researchers, led by Noam Sobel and Jess Porter, chose more docile experimental animals: psychology department undergraduates.'"

He was 86.His son, Andrew McColough, said the cause was cardiac arrest after a long illness.During a lengthy career, Mr. McColough was a fixture in American commerce. In addition to Xerox executive posts, he served on the boards of the New York Stock Exchange, Citibank, Union Carbide and Knight Ridder. He was also chairman of the United Way of America, and the treasurer of the Democratic National Committee from 1974 to 1976.He was a graduate of the Harvard Business School class of 1949, and like most of the men who attended the school in the aftermath of World War II, he had seen military duty, serving briefly in the British Navy in the final year of the war.Of that class of 700, nearly a third rose to the rank of president or chief executive of a company, according to David Callaghan, the author of a book on the class of ’49. Fortune magazine called it “the class the dollars fell on.”Mr. McColough was born in Halifax, Nova Scotia, the oldest son of the director of public works for the Parliament of Canada. He graduated from Dalhousie University in Halifax and then earned a law degree at Osgoode Hall Law School in Toronto before attending Harvard.'"
"'06-12-18,'0','Mr. Kelly said in a separate interview that the investor group included a new strategic media partner he declined to name, and both men would not predict when a deal might come to fruition.“Any number of things can happen,” Mr. Kreeger said.This is only the latest twist in the short but contentious history of Air America. At the root of its problems, some critics and competitors say, has been an inability to negotiate a middle path between its political mission and its business.“It’s my feeling that they really put this together without broadcasters,” said Stuart Krane, a former ABC Radio executive who is the president of Product First, which owns the program of a liberal talk-show host, Ed Schultz. “If you have a healthy business, then your agenda will be put forth.”Air America ran into financial trouble within days of its appearance on March 31, 2004, when it turned out that its original chairman, Evan Cohen, did not have the backing he said he did. Weeks later, Mr. Kelly, a former owner of Midwest radio and television stations, stepped in to take charge of the board. At the end of 2004, he ceded the chairmanship to a new investor, Rob Glaser, chief executive of RealNetworks.Some people at Air America assert that, under Mr. Glaser and the team he put in place, the network was top-heavy with management, inept at selling ads, unwilling to make program compromises that veered from the liberal message and overstaffed with more than 100 employees when two dozen would have sufficed.“What they did for $45 million they could have done for $10 million,” said Sheldon Drobny, an investor with a contentious relationship with the network. Mr. Drobny and his wife, Anita, longtime Democratic activists, are credited with the idea for Air America.The network has run through a stream of operational executives. Danny Goldberg, a music executive who served as chief for about a year before leaving in April 2006, said the problem was “a big gap between the ambitions of the company and the funding available to accomplish those ambitions.”“There was no way to manage around that gap,” he said. “Either lower your expectations or raise more money. No one wanted to change the ambitions.”Faced with constant money woes, the board considered a takeover by the Democracy Alliance, a loose group of moneyed progressives, including George Soros, who had pooled resources to support projects they considered worthy. But the group ultimately rejected the appeal, because “Air America needed to do certain things to make it a more attractive business,” Mr. Kreeger said.Mr. Kelly said he was disappointed that rich Democrats did not step up to support the network’s political goals. On fund-raising calls, he said, he was often turned down because the business plan was too risky.He agreed that the network over-spent, “out of enthusiasm for what we were doing.” But he said it also “inherited so many difficulties not of our own making.”Saying that Air America reaches millions of listeners and “clearly had an impact on the 2006 elections,” Mr Kelly added, “I think with a relatively small amount of money, we have succeeded wildly.”Late in August, the network lost its lease with WLIB in New York and switched to a weaker station, WWRL 1600. Some liberals blamed Product First, which was negotiating its own WLIB deal. It later fell through.“We just saw WLIB as something we might own and do very well with,” Mr. Krane said. “There was never any nefarious plot here.”Late in September, the Drobnys tried to buy Air America for $2.5 million, but the deal fell apart because, Mr. Drobny says, the terms were changed. He said he would have had to put the money into Piquant’s operating account, where it could have been tapped by creditors, instead of into a shielded holding company.In an e-mail message to the board, Mr. Drobny wrote that “one or more of the board members and attorneys have intentionally taken steps to put the company into Chapter 11 and have taken actions that are intentionally to the detriment of the current members and their creditors.”Tracy L. Klestadt, the network’s bankruptcy lawyer, termed that “absolutely inaccurate,” saying the terms always called for the purchaser to invest in Piquant L.L.C. and “the Drobnys would not agree to it.”As for the bankruptcy filing, which came after a creditor, MultiCultural Radio Broadcasting, sought to freeze company accounts, Mr. Klestadt said the board decided a Chapter 11 proceeding “would be the best way to maximize the value of the assets.”Mr. Glaser, who resigned from the board along with Mr. Kreeger and Mr. Kelly at the time of the filing, declined to comment. He is the network’s largest creditor with $9.8 million in claims.Since Air America sought bankruptcy protection, 5 to 10 potential buyers have looked at the books, Mr. Klestadt said. Late Friday, it told affiliates that “an official letter of intent has been signed,” but declined to name the prospective buyer “due to the sensitive nature of this deal.”Some affiliates have grown weary. In recent weeks, an affiliate in the Quad Cities market of western Illinois and eastern Iowa switched its programming to Christmas music, and stations owned by Clear Channel in Boston, Cincinnati and Madison announced plans to bail out.Moreover, Jerry Springer just ended his Air America-syndicated radio show, which never gained a wide audience. Mr. Franken has been telling associates that he is likely to run for the Senate from Minnesota.Mr. Franken, who is on a U.S.O. tour of Iraq and Afghanistan and says he is owed $360,750 by the network, declined requests for comment. Through Air America’s spokeswoman, he said, that “although I do not know the specific details about A.A.R.’s progress through the Chapter 11 restructuring process, I was pleased to hear that they had received a letter of intent from a prospective buyer.” He added his hope “that the network’s ownership situation and financing difficulties will be resolved while I am away.”When he returns, he faces competition from an unexpected source: Product First’s Ed Schultz, who went on the air in January 2004, three months before Air America. Last week, Mr. Schultz’s program moved to a live broadcast against Mr. Franken’s.Mr. Franken “gave visibility to the format, but at the end of the day, you’d better be selling a commercial,” Mr. Schultz said. “You have to run it like a business.”Mr. Franken said he was “pleased to welcome Ed Shultz as a direct competitor.”“Ed’s success,” he added, “is proof of the vitality of the progressive talk format. I consider Ed a friend — unless he starts beating me in the ratings, at which point I plan to downgrade him to acquaintance.”The Drobnys have started their own network, Nova M Radio, which has two stations and two talk hosts, Mike Newcomb and a former Air America broadcaster, Mike Malloy. They are courting other liberal media people to do programs for the 15 to 20 affiliates they said will soon join them. Mr. Drobny called the effort, “the second coming of Air America.” Mr. Kelly said Air America is also in “active discussions” with new progressive hosts and hopes to add an investigative unit if his group is successful.Mr. Kreeger added that “it will be up to us to really create compelling content” and lure affiliates back. Until then, there is an existing deal with XM Satellite Radio and the network’s Web site, which he said had “absolute untapped potential for 24/7 online streaming that has never been effectively monetized.”He disputes the idea that Air America “was a vanity project,” but acknowledged that things may be done differently in the future. “I have come to understand very clearly that the radio component of this requires a radio professional,” he said.'"

He led the country three times between 1979 and 1992.Among those who made payments to the prime minister were a former head of a supermarket chain seeking assistance with tax authorities, and a now dead Saudi Arabian diplomat, according to the tribunal’s report.The tribunal, led by High Court Judge Michael Moriarty, also found that Mr. Haughey had “misappropriated” most of the money raised to pay for a successful liver transplant for a friend, Foreign Minister Brian Lenihan.More than $300,000 was raised for the surgery, but Mr. Haughey took a “sizeable proportion” of the money and deposited it “for his personal use” in his official bank account, meant to pay for his day-to-day expenses as prime minister, according to the tribunal’s report.Mr. Haughey also used political donations to his political party, Fianna Fail, for his own use.“Apart from the almost invariably secretive nature of payments from senior members of the business community, their very incidence and scale, particularly during difficult economic times nationally, and when governments led by Mr. Haughey were championing austerity, can only be said to have devalued the value of a modern democracy,” the tribunal said.'"
"'06-12-19,'1','HOOD RIVER, Ore., Dec. 19 —Rescue teams scaled back their search for two climbers who have been missing on Mount Hood for more than week, reflecting both their focus on a relatively small area near the summit and the cold logic telling them that the chances of finding them alive have grown slim.“We are approaching that time when we’ve got to make some serious considerations about whether we’re spinning our wheels,” Sheriff Joe Wampler of Hood River County said today. A fresh bout of foul weather is expected on the mountain as soon as Wednesday, he said, which would put the rescue effort “on hold.”The body of the third man in the climbing group, Kelly James of Dallas, was found in a snow cave near the 11,239-foot summit on Sunday, a week after he told his family by cellphone that he was taking shelter there. Mr. James had an arm injury, possibly dislocating his shoulder, the sheriff said today. His two fellow climbers, Brian Hall of Dallas and Jerry Cooke of Brooklyn, known by the nickname Nikko, apparently attempted to descend the mountain to find help for him.After several days scouring much of the perimeter of the mountain, following various potential clues to the two men’s whereabouts, rescuers are now concentrating on an area on the north side of the mountain, just below the summit. There, rescuers found a hastily dug snow cave containing two ice axes and other tools — critical climbing gear that was not likely to have been intentionally left behind.The sheriff has said the two climbers may have fallen in a steep section known as the gullies, near Eliot Glacier, and that they could have encountered an avalanche. He said they also might have found shelter in a crag in the ice and snow that has since become buried, and are now “waiting for us to come get them.”The three climbers began their ascent of Mt. Hood on Dec. 8, planning to reach the top and then descend in a single day.'"
"'06-12-19,'1','He characterized her choices as “very, very bad.” But in the end Donald J. Trump magnanimously announced today that he would give a second chance to Miss USA, Tara Conner, the beauty pageant winner who has been the subject of numerous published reports of alcohol and drug use and wild partying.Miss Conner, who just turned 21, fought back tears as she appeared at a news conference with Mr. Trump, a co-owner of the Miss Universe Organization. Wearing a light blue shirt under a dark pinstripe suit, Ms. Conner acknowledged drinking alcohol while under the legal age, but said that it would be “pushing” it to say that she had a drinking problem.“I would not say that I am an alcoholic,” she said, though at times, she said, she was unable to resist drinks offered free to her. “We all have personal demons that we all have to face at some time or another,” she said.Ms. Conner and Mr. Trump refused to answer any questions from reporters about reports alleging drug use or drug testing. Mr. Trump said that he went into a meeting with Ms. Conner this morning expecting to terminate her reign as Miss USA. But he said the meeting showed him someone with “a good heart” who had “left a small town in Kentucky,” only to be caught up in a “whirlwind” in New York.“It’s a story that has happened many times before, to many women and to many men that came to the Big Apple,” Mr. Trump said.'"
"'06-12-19,'1','Separately, the Commerce Department issued a report on housing construction this morning that contained some mixed signals. On the one hand, the number of building permits authorized last month fell again, for the tenth straight month, a reminder of just how fragile the housing market remains. Permits declined by 3 percent for the month, seasonally adjusted, and were 31.3 percent lower than a year ago.But in the same reports, the number of homes actually begun by builders rose 6.7 percent in November, seasonally adjusted.Economists were quick to say that a November rebound in the housing-starts figure was likely simply because October’s figures had shown the steepest decline in six years, and that he new figures did not necessarily signal a turn in the broader downward trend.“It doesn’t change the bottom line,” said Richard F. Moody, chief economist for Mission Residential, a real estate investment firm. “While there is a bottom out there for the housing market, we just don’t know where it is yet.”Wall Street did not much like either the price report or the housing report. Stocks moved broadly lower early in the day, and bond yields bobbed upward for a while, though by late morning both markets were little changed from Monday’s levels.For the Federal Reserve, the reports offer conflicting tugs on policy. On the one hand, the hotter inflation data bolsters the Fed’s case for keeping interest rates unchanged, as it has done at the last four meetings, or even moving closer to an increase. The central bank has repeatedly said that inflation remains too high and that its next move on interest rates is more likely to be upward than downward.But the weak housing report and its implications for a slowing economy would seem to argue for action soon to stimulate growth and demand, perhaps by lowering interest rates. In its latest policy statement, the Fed made its clearest acknowledgment to date that economic growth is faltering, particularly in the housing market.Still, economists said today that the Fed will probably want more evidence of weakness before thinking about easing its foot off the monetary brake pedal. Joel L. Naroff, president of Naroff Economic Advisers, said the central bank is likely to wait several months “before making any judgments about the condition of the housing market.”Because higher prices at the producer level do not always translate into higher prices for consumers, some economists said that today’s report may not change the overall outlook for inflation, which has seemed to improve in recent months.“It should be weighed somewhat,” said Kenneth Beauchemin, a United States economist with Global Insight. “But I’d heavily discount it, especially because of recent positives and consistent news regarding consumer prices.”The government reported last week that the consumer price index was unchanged in November, after declining in September and October, largely because of falling fuel prices. The “core” consumer price index, excluding food and energy, rose slightly each month.'"

"'06-12-19,'1','Yoko Ono’s chauffeur was forced to remain in custody yesterday despite having put together $250,000 cash bail after federal officials issued an order to detain him because of questions about his immigration status.The chauffeur, Koral Karsan, 50, a Turkish immigrant, was arrested and jailed last week on charges of trying to extort $2 million from Ms. Ono, the widow of John Lennon.Mark Thorn, a spokesman for the federal office of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, said the agency had issued a “detainer” for Mr. Karsan. The order means, he said, that if Mr. Karsan were to be released, he would go directly into the custody of immigration officials.Mr. Thorn declined to discuss Mr. Karsan’s immigration status, citing privacy considerations, but said that a detainer is generally issued because of an immigration status violation.Mr. Karsan’s lawyer, Robert Gottlieb, said yesterday that Mr. Karsan came to the United States on a tourist visa in 1992 and obtained an L-1 work visa, as an executive in a Turkish import-export business, in November 1993. “We know that he at least began the process of obtaining permanent resident status,” Mr. Gottlieb said. “I just cannot yet confirm his legal status as of today.”Mr. Gottlieb said he was trying to sort out his client’s immigration status in time for a hearing today, in which the Manhattan district attorney is expected to announce whether a grand jury voted to indict the chauffeur.Mr. Gottlieb had hoped to have his client, who was arrested on Wednesday, released yesterday, after two supporters had put up $250,000 in cashier’s checks for his bail. The district attorney’s office was reviewing documentation Mr. Gottlieb provided to show that the money was obtained legitimately, but the federal detention order takes precedence over the bail.'"
"'06-12-19,'1','Rescuers continued to search for the other missing climbers on Monday, and the authorities suggested that the men might have fallen or had other trouble on a treacherous section on the mountain’s north side.The last known contact with the climbers was on Dec. 10, two days after they had reached the 11,239-foot summit. That day, Kelly James told his wife in a cellphone call that he was taking shelter in a snow cave and that his fellow climbers had left for help.Sheriff Wampler, who is overseeing the rescue effort, said Monday that after Mr. James and the other climbers, Brian Hall, 38, of Dallas, and Jerry Cooke, 36, of Brooklyn, reached the summit, they could have encountered foul weather and decided to build a cave. Mr. James’s arm injury also might have complicated their plans to descend.The cave, about 300 feet from the summit on the south side, is where rescuers found Mr. James’s body. The sheriff said the cave was just large enough for three people. Rescuers found a cellphone there that the sheriff said was “full of water.”The sheriff said the two other climbers might have left to find help for Mr. James as early as Dec. 9. Before rescuers found the cave, they found another one, more hastily built and on the north side; they believed the two climbers might have made it after leaving Mr. James.Three sets of footprints lead from the summit to where Mr. James was found. Only two sets lead to the second cave. There are no obvious tracks leading from the second cave, the sheriff said.Rescuers spotted the second cave because ropes had been anchored near it in a Y shape. The ropes were first said to be a signal marking the climbers’ location, but Sheriff Wampler said Monday that they were more likely an anchor point, perhaps to begin a descent in a particularly steep section known as the gullies.“We assume that was the last known point of the two climbers that were descending,” he said.Elevation on the northeast side can drop about 3,000 feet quickly, and as much as 10 feet of snow has gathered in places recently, the sheriff said. Rescue efforts have been complicated by the risk of avalanches.The gullies area, next to Eliot Glacier, still brittle in places from summer warmth, has holes as deep as 80 feet, said Capt. Chris Bernard of the Oregon National Guard, which is helping coordinate an aerial search.Sheriff Wampler said 13 climbers had died near the gullies in the last 40 years.He said it was possible the two missing climbers had dug a cave elsewhere on the mountain, their tracks hidden by new snow. He added that weather would probably allow rescue work to continue until Wednesday. After that, he said, “we’re going to be limited in what we can do.”'"
"'06-12-19,'1','It was bad enough when studies showed that the newest and most heavily promoted drugs for treating schizophrenia weren’t worth their high cost. Now the disturbing tale of their excessive use has taken a tawdry turn with revelations that Eli Lilly, a pharmaceutical giant, has consistently played down the risks of its best-selling antipsychotic drug, Zyprexa, and has promoted it for unapproved uses.The details were spelled out in The Times this week by Alex Berenson, who drew on hundreds of internal Lilly documents that have surfaced in legal proceedings. Although Lilly says the documents present an inaccurate picture, they offer persuasive evidence that the company engaged in questionable behavior to prop up its best-selling drug, which creates almost 30 percent of Lilly’s revenue.Zyprexa belongs to a class of drugs that were billed as a significant advance over the first generation of antipsychotic drugs but turned out to have serious flaws. Zyprexa, for example, has a tendency to raise blood sugar and to promote obesity, both of which are risk factors for diabetes. Some 30 percent of the patients taking Zyprexa gain 22 pounds or more after a year on the drug, with some gaining 100 pounds or more. Yet the documents show that Lilly encouraged its sales representatives to play down these adverse effects when talking to doctors.The documents also show that Lilly encouraged primary care physicians — far less sophisticated than psychiatrists in treating mental illness — to prescribe the drug for older patients with symptoms of dementia even though it was approved only for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. It is illegal for companies to promote drugs for unapproved uses, but nearly every major drug company is under civil or criminal investigation for alleged efforts to do so.Lilly contends that it has never promoted Zyprexa for unapproved uses and has always shown its marketing materials to the Food and Drug Administration, as required by law. Both claims ought to be tested in Congressional hearings that should focus on how well the industry complies with existing laws and how effectively the F.D.A. regulates the industry’s marketing materials.'"
"'06-12-19,'1','Captain Curbeam then announced that he had “one little bad piece of news,” saying that he noticed one guide wire that had not completely retracted, and was “kind of looped over.” He spent a half-hour examining, and finally tugging the wire into place so that it would not present a snag hazard or scrape the delicate glass panels.By 7:45, about five and a half hours after the spacewalk began, the automatic latches slipped into place to lock the boxes.The main goal of the mission is rewiring the International Space Station so it can begin drawing power from a new solar array that was installed on the side of the station on the previous mission. The new array rotates like a paddlewheel to face the Sun continuously. That array’s power replaces the balky solar array, which sat atop the station as a temporary power source.To start rotating the new array, one-half of the old array had to be retracted; if not, the new arrays would strike it. The NASA plan was to retract one-half of the array completely on this mission and to retract the other half on a mission next March. After it was locked back in its boxes, the array could be moved on a later mission to a new position on the side of the station.Mission managers had hoped that the array would retract without hands-on help, as it was designed to do. But the array had stayed extended in its temporary position for six years, far longer than the original station construction plans called for. NASA officials said going into the mission that they were worried that the panels would not properly retract.The partial retraction last week did provide the clearance that was needed to start up the rotating array and allowed the astronauts to conduct the two spacewalks that successfully rewired the station.But mission managers still hoped to retract the array before the repair crew, especially the highly experienced Captain Curbeam, headed home. And so managers added a fourth spacewalk. Captain Curbeam, by leading all four, set a NASA record for the most spacewalks by an astronaut in a single mission.The Discovery will return to Earth as early as Friday just before 4 p.m. Eastern time. Before then astronauts will conduct a final inspection of the shuttle’s delicate external tiles and panels to see whether any damage occurred on the flight from orbital debris.In an evening news conference, Kirk Shireman, NASA’s deputy space station program manager, said the fourth spacewalk was especially risky, since most spacewalks are planned and practiced for years. This one came together in a couple of days, he noted, with improvised tools and an array that “was not intended to be touched with tools or hands.”'"
"'06-12-19,'1','North Korea also demanded that it be given a nuclear reactor to generate power and assistance in meeting its energy needs until that reactor was operational, The AP reported.In an earlier indication that the North was taking a defiant approach, China Daily reported that North Korea’s negotiator, Deputy Foreign Minister Kim Kye Gwan, said Saturday that it would not halt its nuclear program until Washington abandoned its “hostile’’ policy toward his country.Diplomats and analysts monitoring the talks said they expected all sides to adopt a more flexible stance as the negotiations progressed this week at a state guest house in the Chinese capital. There is no deadline for a conclusion to the talks.North Korea’s decision to resume negotiations so soon after the Oct. 9 test could help defuse fears that Asia is on the brink of an arms race. But most analysts agreed that it will be difficult for the international community to persuade the country to end its nuclear weapons program. Some of the participants at the session Monday were frustrated with the North’s tactics.“The position of the North Korean delegation is wide apart from the rest of us and we cannot accept it,’’ the Japanese negotiator, Kenichiro Sasae, said after the opening session.Several experts said the talks would be fruitless unless the United States relaxed economic and financial sanctions on the North. “If the U.S. does lift some sanctions, I think North Korea will make some concessions,’’ said Yan Xuetong, an expert in international relations at Tsinghua University in Beijing.Mr. Hill said a key objective for the talks was to revive an agreement reached by the six nations in September 2005 on ridding the Korean Peninsula of nuclear weapons. He said that China had been working on a plan to implement the agreement and that it would be discussed as the meeting continued over the rest of the week.Under that vaguely worded agreement — the only significant accord the parties have been able to reach — North Korea would abandon its nuclear weapons program and allow the International Atomic Energy Agency to examine its facilities. In return, the North would be offered a range of diplomatic and economic incentives.Soon after the last six-nation talks, in November 2005, North Korea boycotted further negotiations when the United States imposed penalties on a bank in Macao that Washington asserted was helping to conceal transactions for North Korean companies.Diplomatic pressure on North Korea to restart negotiations intensified after its underground nuclear test on Oct. 9.Even China, North Korea’s closest political and economic ally, condemned the test. In unusually tough language, it backed a unanimous United Nations Security Council resolution to impose sanctions on shipments to North Korea that could benefit the military.On Oct. 31, the North agreed to open a new round of negotiations, the sixth since they began in 2003, in what appeared to be a diplomatic victory for Beijing.China announced that the talks would go ahead after mounting an intense round of behind-the-scenes activity to bring its longtime ally back to the table.North Korea’s agreement to restart the talks was widely seen as a sign that it wanted to avoid or delay the enforcement of the United Nations sanctions imposed after the nuclear test.China and South Korea, which share borders with North Korea and are its closest economic partners, have avoided taking measures that could maximize the impact of the sanctions.The United States has refused to discuss the financial restrictions as part of the nuclear disarmament talks. But Mr. Hill said Washington was ready to discuss the financial restrictions in separate negotiations that are expected to begin in Beijing on Tuesday. Japan has also warned that it will maintain sanctions against North Korea unless there is progress at the six-nation talks on the fate of Japanese citizens who the North admitted it abducted in the 1970s and 1980s.Tokyo has been one of the most strident critics of North Korea’s nuclear test and has banned the North’s ships from its ports, blocked all imports and barred all visitors from its neighbor.'"
"'06-12-19,'1','Wall Street fell yesterday for the first time in four sessions as concerns about the technology and energy sectors overshadowed some $81 billion in takeover activity.Stocks spent most of the day in positive territory as investment bankers squeezed in deals before year-end and helped keep a floor under share prices for most of the day.Among the bigger deals announced, the pharmacy benefits manager Express Scripts said it was offering to buy a rival, Caremark Rx, for about $26 billion. Realogy, which owns the Coldwell Banker real estate franchise, said it had agreed to be acquired by a private equity firm, the Apollo Group, for about $6.65 billion.“What is driving mergers and acquisitions is strong stock prices,” said Steven M. Bernard, director of merger and acquisition market analysis at the investment bank Robert W. Baird & Company. “That gives companies the currency to go out and do deals. This still means there’s a lot of deals out there, and we expect the strength we’re seeing will continue into 2007.”With only 13 days left in 2006, announced deals have already amounted to almost $4 trillion worldwide, beating the $3.33 trillion in deals made in 2000, according to the market analysis company Dealogic.'"
"'06-12-19,'1','The predawn line outside the Old Drum Tower market represents a marriage of convenience: market managers give away cabbage to attract hordes of fixed-income old people in hopes that the spectacle will attract the curiosity of younger, more affluent morning commuters.“It’s a win-win situation,” said Zhang Pinsheng, 68, a retired teacher. “The market doesn’t have to spend money on advertising, and we don’t have to spend money on cabbage.”They do have to wait in freezing predawn temperatures to collect a chunk of greenery of almost no value — or, for that matter, of almost no taste without sauce.This year farmers grew so much cabbage that prices dipped to record lows in November, with markets charging only a few pennies a head. Even so, when the Old Drum Tower market introduced its cabbage promotion in late November, the daily line soon stretched under two overpasses and past a new luxury hotel.“If they were going to give away fish or eggs, the line would stretch all the way to Qianmen,” a neighborhood several miles away, said Li Bao, a vendor at the market. “People would start lining up at midnight.”The incentive for the hundreds of people who come each day is a blend of need, habit, boredom and a desire for companionship. Several people described lives on the margins. Some were retired; others lost their jobs in the changing economy; others depended on minuscule urban pensions. Mrs. Wang said she did not watch television in her apartment, because “the TV uses electricity.”Mr. Zhang, the retired teacher, said the free cabbage “doesn’t really solve the basic problems you have, but it can help a little.”“You aren’t going to get rich collecting free cabbage,” he said. “My life is pretty average. We don’t worry about food or clothes. You’re never really full, but you are never going to go hungry.”Inflation has ticked upward in recent months, and the rising cost of some foods, as well as cooking oil, has brought some anxiety. Recently, Prime Minister Wen Jiabao visited an elderly Beijing woman to offer a public reassurance that the government would fight rising prices.Cabbage, often used as filling for the steamed dumpling so popular in Beijing, seems mostly immune to inflation, though, and some people admitted that the line here was as much a social event as an economic necessity.Many retirees in Beijing have limited resources and unlimited time to fill, so they congregate in city parks to practice tai chi or ballroom dancing, or just to talk. Another popular pastime is admonishing parents, including strangers, whose children are deemed to be insufficiently clothed — say, less than five layers — in wintertime.But a few hours in line can also provide entertainment for people inured to hardship and tedium by a few decades of Communism. “It doesn’t matter if I get a cabbage,” said one man, who like several people declined to give his name. “It’s a nice day and I’ve got nothing to do.”Another woman with a toothy smile and a pink coat agreed. “We have nothing better to do,” she said. “We go for a walk in the morning. We get in line, and we pick up some cabbage.”Zhang Hongwei, 27, one of the managers at the market, said the cabbage promotion would last two months. He said that most people in line were not buying other vegetables but that their presence “is good advertising and attracting others.”“If they weren’t here they would just be walking around in parks,” he said. “And it is a tradition in Beijing to store cabbage in the winter. They need to get their cabbage.”A certain regimen oversees the process. Regulars arrive early, occasionally shoo newcomers into a single-file line and snatch up the laminated tickets handed out by the market to ensure order. Many people bring cushions for comfortable sitting. Line breakers are barked down.The magic moment comes promptly at 8:30. On this recent day, a manager began collecting the tickets. Another clerk popped open the rear hood of a white van to reveal green stacks of cabbage. Distribution was methodical — perhaps to drag out the advertising as commuters rushed into a nearby subway stop.Mrs. Wang collected her cabbage with a satisfied smile. She stuffed it into a plastic bag and walked quickly down the sidewalk, oblivious to the cold.“To be a little cold for a cabbage is not a big deal,” she said. “Cabbage is delicious.”'"
"'06-12-19,'1','He said that “this is a big hot-button issue” and that Judge Neff had not made it clear that her presence at the ceremony did not mean she could not rule without bias in deciding cases involving same-sex unions. “I’d like to know more factually about what took place,” he said.On Oct. 12, Judge Neff answered a long list of written questions from Mr. Brownback. In her letter, she said she would decide any cases that came before her according to the law and the Constitution and would not be guided by her personal views. That is the same pledge that several conservative Republican judicial nominees made when asked whether their blunt personal statements opposing abortion rights and same-sex marriages would affect their performance on the bench.Mr. Brownback, a member of the Judiciary Committee who supported those other nominees, has tried to put himself forward as the Republican presidential contender who best represents the interests of the nation’s conservative religious community.In her letter, Judge Neff said she had attended the ceremony in Massachusetts as a guest, not as a presiding jurist. As the ceremony occurred before Massachusetts’s highest court approved same-sex unions, it did not have any legal validity.One of the women in the ceremony, Judge Neff wrote, was the daughter of a family who had lived next door for 26 years. She said the families were so close that the woman was, in effect, a part of her family and was like a big sister to her own daughters. She said that she had delivered a homily at the ceremony and that “it was no different than being asked by my own daughters to be part of an important event in their lives.”Charles Fried, a Harvard Law School professor and leading conservative scholar, said Mr. Brownback’s actions were improper. “First of all, people go to parties for all sorts of reasons,” Professor Fried said, and how one would rule on a case should not be inferred from that private activity.Further, he said, “It would be inappropriate for the judge to recuse herself from any such case because it is a judge’s duty to sit on cases” unless there is a clear conflict of interest. There would be a genuine conflict of interest, he said, if the judge had a financial interest in a case’s result or had been associated with one of the parties in the case.“For her to agree to any such restriction in this case would be wrong,” said Professor Fried, who has been both a judge and the solicitor general of the United States.Judge Neff’s nomination was included in a package of more than a dozen nominees whose confirmation had been agreed upon by both Democrats and Republicans. Mr. Brownback’s objections held up the whole roster of nominees.Mr. Brownback said that when Judge Neff was renominated in January, he would insist only that the nomination not be approved in a voice vote, but one in which each senator is obliged to record a personal vote.'"
"'06-12-19,'1','“Clearly we are not getting through,” Stern said. “Or the players cannot, in certain circumstances, just do not, want to be restrained. I would suggest that those players will not have long careers in the N.B.A. because we’ve made our intention very clear here.”The questions of blame and innocence swirled in Denver. The Nuggets, who will be without Anthony until Jan. 20, are expected to intensify their pursuit of the league’s second-leading scorer, Allen Iverson.“The window of making mistakes is small,” Denver Coach George Karl said before the Nuggets played the Wizards last night. “I think we should look at it as a 15-game playoff series.”The Nuggets advised Karl not to speak further after his outburst at the morning shootaround, when he used a vulgarity to refer to Thomas and called Thomas’s actions premeditated.Thomas, who said yesterday that he was scolding Anthony for still being in the game with the Nuggets leading by 119-100 with 1 minute 32 seconds remaining, did not respond to Karl’s comments. He referred to a statement by the Garden chairman, James L. Dolan, who called the incident “unacceptable.”In the most surreal scene of the night, Dolan walked onto the court an hour before the Knicks-Jazz game and shook hands with Scott Layden, whom he fired three years ago this week and replaced with Thomas. Layden, an assistant with the Jazz, declined to comment.Stern said the unprecedented $500,000 fines he levied to each organization were not directed at the actions of Karl or Thomas, but a “more general message that I’m going to start holding our teams accountable for the actions of their players and their employees.“If you continue to employ employees who engage in these actions, your organization is going to have to pay a price, even beyond the suspensions that are involved here,” Stern said.Stern’s ruling — and $500,000 fine — puts the onus on coaches to control their players. Utah Coach Jerry Sloan said he can tell his players “we’re not going to have any nonsense,” but that it is tough to enforce that.“You have a player, emotions get to him, and you can’t always walk out there and control a guy,” Sloan said. “You hope that they use good judgment, but sometimes they don’t.”Since the 2004 brawl, Stern has been trying to exert control over the players’ behavior and their image, including the enforcement of a dress code last season and the mandate this season that the referees crack down on players’ complaining.Billy Hunter, the executive director of the players union, said that he was not surprised by Stern’s ruling and that he did not condone the players’ actions.“I can understand the position that the commissioner finds himself in,” Hunter said. “He obviously has an obligation to try to protect the integrity of the game and to ensure members of the public that it’s a safe place to come and enjoy quality entertainment, but sometimes the amount of punishment he imposes is a bit beyond what’s necessary.“I think fewer games could have been imposed to get his message across.”The Knicks’ Nate Robinson, who escalated the fourth-quarter brawl by grabbing the Nuggets’ J. R. Smith and spinning him into the front row of the stands, received a 10-game suspension, as did Smith.Collins, whose flagrant foul on Smith ignited the fight and who later confronted him, was suspended six games. Jared Jeffries, the Knicks forward who rushed after Anthony, received a four-game suspension. The Knicks’ Jerome James and the Nuggets’ Nenê were each suspended one game for leaving the bench.The suspensions were the longest and most comprehensive since the Palace brawl. Ron Artest, who ran into the stands and punched a fan after a fan tossed a beverage at him, was suspended the rest of the season, 72 games. Indiana’s Stephen Jackson drew 30 games and Jermaine O’Neal 25, also for fighting with fans.O’Neal later appealed to an independent arbitrator and had his suspension reduced to 15 games.Anthony’s suspension was more than 12 games, so he was eligible to file a grievance with an independent arbitrator. The other players, if they appeal, must do so to Stern.“I am comfortable that these actions by me will stand,” Stern said.Stern’s point was that Anthony had a chance to think about his actions and pull back. Instead, he ran after Collins and punched him.No matter that Anthony, who will lose close to $634,000 in salary, had been the best player on the United States national team last summer, or that he was emerging as a marketable young star on the same plane as LeBron James and Dwyane Wade.“We judged him on the actions on the court, period,” Stern said. “As a personal matter, he’s been doing great. That’s separate and apart from how you have to deal with these failures to exercise these degrees of self-control.”But what role did the coaches have in controlling their players? Karl did have Anthony on the court in the final 1:32 with the Nuggets ahead by 19 points, though he was ready to substitute for him before Marcus Camby missed the second of two free throws.It was then that Thomas told Anthony not to not go near the basket. It was an exchange caught on the MSG Network feed, and N.B.A. officials carefully read Thomas’s lips in repeated viewings of the tape Sunday.But there is a line between the N.B.A. coaches’ “no-layup rule,” where defenders understand they must foul an opponent hard when one is driving to the basket, and a coach calling for physical harm. It was a line that, legally, the N.B.A. could not prove Thomas crossed.Although Karl said at the shootaround that Thomas “directed” such a flagrant foul, he also contended that Thomas exacerbated the situation after the game by criticizing Karl indirectly for keeping Anthony in the game.“I think his actions after the game were despicable,” Karl said of Thomas. “He made a bad situation worse. I’ll swear on my children’s life that I never thought about running up the score. I wanted to get a big win on the road.”There is no love lost between Karl and Thomas, especially concerning Larry Brown, Karl’s close friend, whom Thomas fired.But the Nuggets’ president for basketball operations, Mark Warkentein, laughed off the suggestion that Brown was the reason Karl was trying to embarrass Thomas.“The urban myth is that George left the starters in because of Larry Brown,” Warkentein said. “Those who believe that should be chasing Ron and Nicole’s killer. It’s an urban myth.”While the Nuggets pursue Iverson, Warkentein said that any trade would not involve the players with long suspensions, Anthony and Smith. Nenê could still be involved. Warkentein acknowledged the mistakes all three had made.“We take full responsibility,” he said. “We were wrong, dead wrong, seriously wrong. No excuses. J. R. should have stepped up and shot his free throws. Melo shouldn’t have been in the situation he was in. At the same time, this is three quality men. There were serious lapses in judgment. We stand by them.”'"

"'06-12-20,'0','Ms. Tarisa and other Thai officials have been widely criticized over the policy moves this week, as well as over an apparent lack of coordination and a blurring of the lines between the supposedly independent central bank and the Finance Ministry. On Tuesday, when the stock market in Bangkok was plunging, Ms. Tarisa was traveling and unavailable for comment.“With something like this, the central bank governor has to step up forcefully and calm the markets,” said Thitinan Pongsudhirak, a professor of political science at Chulalongkorn University in Bangkok. “She was on holiday.”A press officer at the central bank said that Ms. Tarisa was in the northern city of Chiang Mai on Tuesday but declined to say what she was doing there.In the end, it was the finance minister, Pridiyathorn Devakula, not Ms. Tarisa, who announced that the capital controls would be rolled back and would no longer apply to stock-market investors.Thirachai Phuvanatnaranubala, the secretary general of the Thai Securities and Exchange Commission, said he had not been told in advance about the imposition of capital controls.“The central bank relied mainly on their academic research to come up with the baht control measure without consulting with us,” Mr. Thirachai told reporters.Ms. Tarisa said the biggest problem on Monday was not the new regulations themselves, but rather a failure to let investors know enough about them. “There was not enough communication in English in terms of the details of the regulation,” she said.The bank has been battling to contain a surge of short-term inward investment, particularly in Thai corporate bonds and commercial paper. It issued new restrictions on foreign investment in the bond market on Dec. 4, but the measures failed to have any impact.The bank then decided to impose blanket limitations on all foreign investment, Ms. Tarisa said, because of the difficulty of determining the purpose of specific investment inflows. The central bank deliberately gave investors only one day of warning, in hopes of preventing them from dumping their Thai assets in anticipation of the new rules.Even so, the market response was mush sharper than the bank forecast, Ms. Tarisa said. “Investors overreacted well beyond our expectations,” she said.The new rules, withdrawn today, required investors to set aside 30 percent of any new investment in a non-interest-bearing reserve account for one year, and calculated the opportunity cost of doing so at about 1.5 percent. With investors in Thailand now often earning 20 percent a year on their money, Ms. Tarisa said, “we did not see that as a major factor to scare the long-term investors.”“We know very well that we cannot go against the market,” she said.The goal of the bank’s policy was to slow the upward trend in the baht to give Thai exporters, particularly in the agricultural sector, time to adjust. Money had been pouring into the Thai bond market at a rate of $1 billion a week, Ms. Tarisa said, compared with $300 million a week last year. It remains to be seen whether the country can succeed in stemming that tide.“It does mean the risk of investing in Thailand has increased,” Supavud Saicheua, an economist at Phatra Securities in Bangkok, said of this week’s developments. “People won’t forget. When you lose 15 percent in the market in one day, it’s very difficult to forget.”James McCormack, senior director at Fitch Ratings in Hong Kong, agreed with Ms. Tarisa that capital inflows were a regional problem.“Every Asian economy is dealing with currency strength in one way or another, and it’s something they don’t want,” he said, “They’re still export-led economies.”Worsening the problem is China’s policy of keeping its currency, the yuan or renminbi, pegged to the dollar, economists said. That keeps the yuan from rising even as China’s trade surplus grows and investment pours into the country, facing smaller exporters like Thailand with the need to keep their own currency from rising too quickly to avoid losing exports to China.Domestically, the policy reversal this week has taken its toll on the image of Thailand’s military-appointed government. When it was presented in October, the cabinet was described as a team of technocrats untainted by politics and typified by Mr. Pridiyathorn, the finance minister, an American-trained economist who once headed the central bank. That image unraveled this week.“It’s very unfortunate,” said Korn Chatikavanij, a former investment banker who is deputy secretary general of the Thai Democratic Party. “It’s a reflection of the drawback of having a technocratic government, one that doesn’t quite grasp the world’s realities and the realities of how markets function.”The cabinet is led by Surayud Chulanont, a former general who was appointed by the military three weeks after the Sept. 19 coup that ousted the populist former prime minister, Thaksin Shinawatra.Early on, the new government’s priorities hit roadblocks. The cabinet proposed and then abandoned a rise in the legal drinking age. A proposal to ban alcohol advertising also hit snags. More significantly, a major initiative to bring peace to the restive Muslim provinces of southern Thailand has not put a dent in the almost daily killings there.“The government has lost its way,” said Mr. Thitinan, the professor.The reversal on capital controls was the government’s “first major economic policy crisis,” Mr. Thitinan said, adding, “It cast a long shadow on the government.”The government must now reckon with the wrath of stock-market investors, who displayed their anger on newspaper Web sites and in chat rooms.“Pridiyathorn has created a whole lot more enemies from this episode,” a leading Thai daily, The Nation, said in an editorial Wednesday. “His enemies are now picking up their knives.”'"
"'06-12-20,'0','New Jersey yesterday became the last state in the country to offer needle exchange programs for intravenous drug users, when Gov. Jon S. Corzine signed legislation authorizing a pilot program for up to six towns. The law allows drug users to exchange used syringes for new ones, and provides $10 million for drug treatment facilities. A bipartisan array of legislators who attended the bill-signing ceremony said that such programs could help reduce the spread of H.I.V. in New Jersey, which has one of the country’s highest infection rates.

The decision to keep the target for the overnight call rate at 0.25 percent was widely expected, but the unanimity of the vote prompted some buying of Japanese government bond futures. The bank left its overall assessment of the economy unchanged in a monthly report released after the rate decision, saying it is expanding moderately. Still, it revised downward its view on personal consumption. (REUTERS)Statistics Canada said the country’s inflation rate was 1.4 percent in November, up from 0.9 percent a month earlier. The agency attributed the rise to increased housing prices as well as an apparent end to declining gasoline prices. The rise in housing costs was most acute in the energy-rich province of Alberta where prices were up 45.2 percent over the last year. Nationally, the cost of carrying a mortgage was up 4.7 percent.

A link to Nomura, which is based in Tokyo, would enable Fortress to sell hedge funds and other products in Asia, the firms said in a statement.Nobuyuki Koga, Nomura’s chief executive, has been seeking ways to cut his firm’s reliance on domestic stock trading, which produces 30 percent of revenue, while expanding globally to compete with Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley. Last month, Nomura agreed to buy the American electronic brokerage firm Instinet to gain access to 700 hedge fund clients.“I can understand the logic, especially after the investment in Instinet,” said Elisabeth Rudman, a credit analyst in Tokyo for Moody’s Investors Service. “Japanese financial firms have had difficulties managing overseas investments in the past. It will be important for Nomura to demonstrate that they can generate substantial returns.”Still, Nomura may be overpaying as it seeks to match the profitability of Wall Street giants like Goldman and Morgan Stanley. Nomura’s stake in Fortress comes at a higher price, compared with assets, than the $300 million Morgan Stanley paid in October for a 19 percent stake in Lansdowne Partners, a London hedge fund with $12 billion in assets.Lawrence Heiman, a spokesman in Tokyo for Nomura, declined to give specifics on the Fortress acquisition.

"'06-12-20,'0','The police last night would not release any working theories or motives for the crime. They did say, however, that nothing was taken from Mr. Carney or his cousin, Joshua Norfleet, 18.They said that Mr. Carney and Mr. Norfleet scuffled with two men dressed in black hooded sweatshirts about 6:15 p.m. on Monday. The two men fled after the stabbing, the police said, and as of last night no arrests had been made.“He was a person who didn’t really bother people unless he was bothered,” Ms. Carney said, adding that her son had no connection to anyone in New York except his cousin. “Nothing that he would have been involved in prior here would have prompted this,” she said.On Monday night, Mr. Carney and his cousin went out for something to eat, Ms. Norfleet said. She and her fiancé were watching television, she added, when they heard a commotion outside the basement apartment.“I thought it was them playing,” she said, but then she realized her son was yelling for help. When she and her fiancé got outside, her son said they had been attacked.She found Mr. Carney just inside a doorway a few steps down from her apartment on East 54th Street. A resident of the building, Shirley Ridgewood, was hovering over him. He had stumbled in, bleeding profusely, Ms. Ridgewood said.“All he said was help me, help me,” Ms. Ridgewood said yesterday, adding that one of her family members called 911. “We did what we could,” she said.In the scuffle, Joshua was hit in the nose, Ms. Norfleet said, but managed to punch whoever attacked him, and he said he heard something fall to the ground, and that it was a knife. “My son could have been a homicide victim as well,” she said.The police said no knife was found at the scene.Ms. Norfleet said that Mr. Carney had come to New York to help her move in with her fiancé.

"'06-12-20,'0','A state appellate court ruled yesterday that because of an “apparent loophole” in city rules, a candidate whose campaign has failed to document that it properly spent public matching funds cannot be held personally liable for repaying the money.The ruling, a defeat for the New York City Campaign Finance Board, is significant because it could cripple the board’s ability to crack down effectively on campaign finance violations and the misuse of matching funds. “The board is reviewing the decision at this time, and considering whether to appeal,” said Amy M. Loprest, executive director of the board.The decision arose after the board cited two unsuccessful candidates for the City Council for violating campaign finance rules that require documentation of contributions and expenses. In 2002, the board ordered one candidate, Edwin O. Ortiz Jr., and his campaign treasurer, Kenneth T. Brennan, to repay $46,071 in matching funds. In 2003, it ordered the second candidate, Richard Perez, to repay $63,756. Mr. Brennan and Mr. Perez appealed; although Mr. Ortiz did not, he stands to benefit from the decision.Writing for the Appellate Division of State Supreme Court in Manhattan, Justice Richard T. Andrias ruled that the board’s audit reports — the basis for demanding repayment — applied strictly to the two men’s campaign committees.The board had argued that it routinely warned the candidates and their campaign treasurers that they would be held personally liable for repaying funds not shown to have been properly spent. The board sent letters demanding the repayments and even posted the delinquent candidates’ names on its Web site to shame them into complying.But Justice Andrias concluded that those warnings were not legally relevant. He found that although one provision of the city’s Administrative Code holds candidates and their treasurers personally liable for penalties imposed for rule violations, another provision specifically states that when matching funds must be repaid to the city, it is the campaign committee that is responsible.'"
"'06-12-20,'0','While a handful of public universities have long stood among the nation’s top institutions — the University of California, Berkeley, and the University of Michigan among them — many have only recently joined their ranks.At some of the best public universities, selectivity is up: at the University of Florida, the average student high school grade point average now exceeds 4.0, a feat achievable only with high grades in honors or Advanced Placement classes. And student interest in these institutions is soaring. At the University of Vermont, where three quarters of the freshmen come from other states, applications have more than doubled since 2001.The demands on such universities are growing, too, particularly with many states questioning their spending on higher education. Increasingly, these colleges are expected to bolster their states’ economies by attracting research grants and jobs. To do that, they say, they must compete with elite private universities.So the universities face a tough balancing act: should they push for higher status and higher tuition revenue by accepting more top-achieving, out-of-state students, or should they worry about broadening access for low-income, in-state students? Is their primary goal to serve the people of their state or to compete nationally with private research universities? Can they leave the less prestigious state colleges to serve the bulk of in-state students?“It is increasingly challenging to manage all of those inherently conflicting goals,” said Mark A. Emmert, president of the University of Washington, adding that global competitiveness required world-class scholarship: “When we think about our peers now, we don’t just think about the publics, we throw in Stanford and the Ivies.”In some ways, the University of Washington outdoes its peers. Dr. Emmert says proudly that his university is second only to Harvard in research financing from the National Institutes of Health.In certain respects, flagship public universities have become more like private institutions. Public universities are still far less expensive, but with their tuition rising rapidly, enrolling low-income students has become as much an issue for them as it is for private universities.From 1995 to 2003, flagship and leading public research universities quadrupled their aid to students from families with incomes over $100,000, while aid to students from the poorest families declined, according to the Education Trust. The best public universities, the group said, have come to resemble “gated communities of higher education.”And their aid policies are paramount, because aid given by the universities dwarfs what students get from the federal government.“The rise in the quality of public flagships across the country is in principle a good thing,” said William E. Kirwan, chancellor of the University System of Maryland. “What’s begun to cross the line, though, is when in the pursuit of excellence, our financial aid gets distorted in a way that high-achieving, low-income students who are qualified to go to our best public institutions can’t.”In an implicit recognition of this distortion, several public universities have started programs to help low-income students.The Carolina Covenant at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill was the first such program. Started in 2004, it guaranteed low-income students enough aid to graduate debt-free.This year about 8 percent of the freshman class qualified, in the process helping diversify the student body, which for the first time is less than 70 percent white.The University of Virginia followed with a similar program. And just this fall, the University of Washington did as well.The University of Florida, as much as any, is grappling with these issues.“Florida wants a top-10 university because it’s clear that our economic development is increasingly tied to research,” said Dr. Machen, the president. “The state’s fired up to invest in this university when it sees our projects with the Burnham Institute for Medical Research and Scripps Research Institute.”The university’s financial situation is unique: it has the lowest tuition of the flagships, $3,206 a year. In addition, the state pays 75 percent to 100 percent of tuition and fees for students with high grades and test scores, including more than 90 percent of freshmen.Still, the students at the sprawling Gainesville campus, with its historic buildings, lawns and lush vegetation, are so affluent that those who must work to help support themselves are sometimes put off by the fancy cars, the stylish clothes and what they see as a sense of entitlement around them.“The way they dress, what they talk about, the ‘I drive this, I drive that,’ it gets annoying,” said Angela Momprevil, a sophomore whose parents, Haitian immigrant business owners, did not attend college.Dr. Machen said that when he became president of the university in 2004, he was troubled to discover that the average student’s family income was about $100,000.“That bothered me because public education is supposed to be a ladder to success,” Dr. Machen said. “We don’t want to be an elitist institution. We want to be a mirror of society.”Ever since, he said, he has struggled to balance the quest for higher rankings with the push to serve minority and low-income students. Two of the university’s efforts, the tuition surcharge and a new program for low-income students, could almost stand as the yin and yang of his agenda.Dr. Machen said the university needed the surcharge to supplement its inexpensive tuition and bring in 200 new faculty members.“How can I tell parents that the education their children can get here is on a par with Michigan or North Carolina,” he said, “when my student-teacher ratio is 21 or 22 to 1, and Michigan’s is 15 to 1, Chapel Hill’s 14 to 1?”The surcharge proposal, for next year’s new students, has caused little upset on campus and was endorsed by the Student Senate. But some students had concerns.“I worry that there will be highly qualified students who won’t be able to pay an extra $1,000,” said Sal Picataggio, a junior. “It’s a fine line. I want it to be prestigious, to be top 10, but I also want it to be more accessible.”Even as the cost of education at the University of Florida goes up, Dr. Machen is working to bring in more low-income students.“We found a significant number of accepted students, from the families of the working poor, who didn’t come because they didn’t have the money to pay the costs,” he said. “Loans weren’t attractive to them, and we wanted them here.”So this fall, the university started a program covering the full cost of college, living expenses included, for students from families with incomes under $40,000, if neither parent went to college. The program also attracted more minority students, helping to raise the proportion of blacks among this year’s freshmen to more than 13 percent, from about 10 percent in the two previous years.“It turns out that using ‘first generation in the family to go to college’ is a pretty good surrogate for diversity,” Dr. Machen said.The university is also cutting back merit aid. For years, Gainesville paid dearly to attract National Merit scholars, the students who scored highest on the Preliminary SAT exams. Scholars from out of state pay no tuition at the University of Florida and receive an additional $38,000 over four years.As a result, the school has drawn hundreds of merit scholars, sometimes nearly as many as Harvard. But next fall, the amount of those awards will be cut to $17,000 for out-of-staters.“It gave us a kind of bragging rights,” Dr. Machen said, “but it didn’t help in the world of our peers, because they knew we were buying them.”This is higher-education code: peer ratings are the largest component of the U.S. News & World Report rankings, so anything that does not impress other educators is not likely to help the rankings.Manny A. Fernandez, chairman of the board at the University of Florida, talks as frankly as Dr. Machen about rankings.“I want to be on the cocktail-party list of schools that people talk about, because that influences the decisions of great students and great faculty,” Mr. Fernandez said. “I don’t apologize for trying to get the rankings up, because rankings are a catalyst for changes that improve the school.”'"
"'06-12-20,'0','Wholesale prices unexpectedly shot up in November, a sobering reminder that inflation remains a threat to the economy despite recent signs that prices may be settling down.The Labor Department reported yesterday that the Producer Price Index, which measures what businesses charge one another for everything from iron ore and diesel fuel to cases of soft drinks, rose 2 percent from October to November when seasonally adjusted. The index had not risen by that much in a single month in 32 years.The rise was much steeper than economists had forecast, and it came after several months of data that showed inflation easing at both the consumer and wholesale levels. But most economists said there was no reason to think that prices were on the verge of a run-up.“This shows you that we’re not completely out of the woods yet,” said Andrew Tilton, an economist with Goldman Sachs. “But I think that taken as a whole, the information over the past couple of months is clearly good news on inflation.”Major factors in sending prices soaring were two notoriously volatile components of the index — automobile and energy prices. After falling considerably in October, the wholesale price of gasoline rose 17.9 percent. Prices of sport utility vehicles, pickup trucks and minivans spiked 13.7 percent as automakers began selling new 2007 models.'"
"'06-12-20,'0','He said US Airways had scored lower than Delta on customer satisfaction surveys by J. D. Power & Associates, a consumer research firm. “From a passenger point of view, it’s a nightmare,” he said. Delta also repeated assertions that the US Airways proposal could not win antitrust approval and would so upset workers that service would suffer.US Airways, in a statement after the filing of the Delta bankruptcy plan, said, “We remain a disciplined and determined bidder.” W. Douglas Parker, chief executive of US Airways, has said that the proposed merger would result in $1.65 billion of annual savings, on top of whatever results that Delta projects.No announcement was made by the official committee of Delta creditors, whose claims in the bankruptcy will convert into new Delta common shares, giving them control over the carrier’s future. Daniel H. Golden, a lawyer for the committee at Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld, did not return a call seeking comment.The committee could endorse the Delta plan, effectively ending US Airways’ bid. It could order Delta to allow US Airways to conduct due diligence on Delta, which would also signal to other airlines that competing bids might be welcome. Or it could try to extract improved terms from US Airways or even a different exit plan from Delta, perhaps one that paid out a combination of cash and stock to creditors.An adviser to US Airways, who spoke on the condition of not being named because of a continuing role in the negotiations, said the creditors might not signal their intentions until after the first of the year. It also may take US Airways that long to analyze Delta’s disclosures about its financial prospects and decide if it wants to raise its bid.With Delta not planning an exit from bankruptcy until next spring, “there’s not a big hurry here,” the adviser said.At an estimated $9.4 billion to $12 billion, the value would pay unsecured creditors 63 percent to 80 percent of their claims against Delta. Existing shareholders would receive nothing.In its forecast, Delta said it expected to report net income of about $1 billion a year by 2008. Revenue from passengers is forecast to rise an average of 6 percent a year from 2007 to 2010 as Delta’s fleet expands, its planes fly fuller and fares rise.The projections assume an increase in fuel costs of just 5 percent a year from 2008 to 2010.In other words, just about everything is expected to go Delta’s way, in an industry that rarely enjoys such good fortune. Edward H. Bastian, the chief financial officer, said the carrier’s relatively low costs, low debt loads and ability to shed assets through renegotiated leases would make it less vulnerable in a downturn.“Projections are made to be broken and they’re usually broken on the downside,” said Roger King, an airline analyst at CreditSights, “because only optimists pay for them.”'"
"'06-12-20,'0','The controls that Bangkok employed were intended to push the currency down by dissuading foreigners from buying baht. Governments across Asia are grappling with a dollar that is rapidly declining against their currencies. This phenomenon raises the price of Asian exports for consumers in the United States and other dollar-based economies.Thailand has suffered the most in Asia in that regard. “What Thailand is doing is, in a way, a precursor to what others might be contemplating but in their own cost-benefit analysis don’t yet have the guts to do,” said Venkatraman Anantha-Nageswaran, an economist at Bank Julius Baer in Singapore.The concern among policy makers in Southeast Asia is that, as they learned during the 1997 financial crisis, foreign funds can flow out as quickly as they flow in, devastating financial markets in their wake. The capital controls, similar to ones adopted and eventually rescinded by Malaysia in the 1990s, were announced Monday by the newly appointed central bank governor, Tarisa Watanagase.Foreign investors were required by Monday’s decree to put 30 percent of incoming funds in reserve for one year. The reserve funds would not earn interest and would be subject to a 10 percent tax if the money was withdrawn before one year.After the market shock Tuesday, Mr. Pridiyathorn consulted with brokers, investors and representatives of foreign banks and announced that the reserve requirement would no longer apply to stocks. The rule remains in place for bonds and commercial paper.Investors lost more than $20 billion in paper wealth Tuesday when stocks in Thailand suffered their largest drop in over a decade. They were particularly angered by Mr. Pridiyathorn’s comment late Tuesday that “just one day of stocks falling is not considered much damage.”“He was far too nonchalant,” said Korn Chatikavanij, a former president of the Thai arm of J. P. Morgan Chase who is deputy secretary general of the Democrat Party. “Genuine damage was caused today that needs to be acknowledged.”Outside Thailand there are no signs that other central bankers will impose similar capital controls. Central bank officials in Indonesia and South Korea said Tuesday that they did not consider any policy changes necessary. Malaysia specifically ruled out such controls.The Bank of Thailand may well have done the job for them, economists said. Analysts said that with the year-end holidays approaching, investors were typically on the lookout for any news that would justify selling their positions and closing the books.The Bank of Thailand may therefore have inadvertently provided the pinprick to a six-month rally in emerging Asian markets that has been pushing stocks and currencies to record highs since May, when fears of rising United States interest rates brought an abrupt halt to the previous appetite for Asian equity.“The liquidity has not died away,” said Amy Auster, a regional economist at ANZ Bank in Melbourne, Australia. “We are in an environment with a strong risk appetite, and that will favor Asia.”According to data compiled by Nomura, roughly $2.8 billion has poured into Thailand’s stock market from overseas this year despite political turmoil that culminated in the September coup. Likewise, equity investors have plowed more than $1 billion into the Philippines, $1.78 billion into Indonesia and $8.3 billion into India.'"
"'06-12-20,'0','BAGHDAD, Dec. 19 — Images of villagers dying from what prosecutors said was a chemical attack on Kurds were shown here on Tuesday at the trial of Saddam Hussein.Mr. Hussein is facing charges of genocide in connection with the deaths of 50,000 Kurds in a campaign that ultimately killed 180,000 Kurds in the 1980s.

"'06-12-20,'0','Based on the earnings revisions, Nasdaq’s offer represents 24.7 times 2006 earnings a share, below the trading multiples of most other major exchanges, the London market said in a report urging shareholders not to sell their shares to Nasdaq.In New York on Tuesday, Nasdaq stock fell $1.94, to close at $34.05. Shares in the London Stock Exchange fell 7 pence here, to £13.10. Short-term investors, including hedge funds, have bought 30 to 40 percent of the London market’s shares, and are betting that Nasdaq will improve its offer.Nasdaq, which bought 28.75 percent of the London exchange on the open market, said last month that the £12.43 bid was its final offer unless another bidder stepped in, or its bid won the approval of London’s board. Neither seems likely.Nasdaq will have to walk away from the bid for a year if it cannot get just over 50 percent of the London exchange’s shares by a February deadline.Not surprisingly, London market executives’ comments had an unyielding quality. “Their constraints are self-imposed,” Ms. Furse said, referring to Nasdaq’s calling its bid a “final offer.” That was a “tactic intended to get our share price down.”The president of Nasdaq, Robert Greifeld, said the London exchange was “ignoring the elephant in the room at its peril.” London, he said, was not considering the future effects of increased competition, adding that the exchange’s current share price was sustainable only because of Nasdaq’s offer.While Nasdaq and the London market bickered, trans-Atlantic cooperation flowered in other parts of Europe. Euronext shareholders voted overwhelmingly Tuesday in favor of a $14 billion deal with the NYSE Group, parent of the New York Stock Exchange, which is expected to create a trans-Atlantic market with $100 billion in daily trading volume and bolster the Big Board’s international expansion plans.The vote was the culmination of seven months of discussions between those exchanges, numerous appeals to their shareholders and regulators, several rounds of negotiation and renegotiation of deal terms, and long sessions quieting the concerns of European politicians. Creation of the trans-Atlantic exchange still faces some hurdles, but analysts and investors in both regions said Tuesday that they were confident it would go through.The deal would allow the huge pools of investor capital in the United States to flow into stocks in France, Belgium, Portugal and the Netherlands, as well as Euronext’s derivatives-trading platform. European investors will get easier access to American capital markets and to the huge scale of the New York Stock Exchange, which is planning to expand in Asia as well. Just over 92 percent of the shareholders represented at Euronext’s special meeting in Amsterdam voted for the deal, more than expected.The future of stock markets may be global, but analysts said that trans-Atlantic deal making was going smoothly for one New York exchange and not for the other because of specific local details.London exchange management has never been interested in the idea of a merger with Nasdaq because it needs derivatives trading, but not new technology. “Nasdaq doesn’t bring them that much,” said Benn Steil, director of international economics at the Council on Foreign Relations. But Euronext, which was eager to avoid a deal with the Frankfurt market, saw the NYSE Group as a white knight, he added.Some predict that London may be in for tough months ahead. “There is no doubt,” Mr. Steil said, “the L.S.E. management is under significant pressure to find someone to do a deal with or maintain exceptional growth.”'"

"'06-12-20,'0','The Sarbanes-Oxley Act, passed by Congress in 2002 in the wake of the Enron and WorldCom accounting scandals, required companies to assess the quality of their internal financial controls and said auditors should report on the quality of the controls. At the time, that requirement, contained in Section 404 of the act, was not viewed as particularly important because laws that had been on the books for decades required companies to have strong internal controls.What happened, however, was that numerous companies reported inadequate controls and many complained about the cost of the audits to assess them.Last year, the S.E.C. and the board put out interpretations of the rules aimed at lowering the costs, but companies said that the auditors did not change their practices. A small business advisory committee appointed by William H. Donaldson, then the chairman of the S.E.C., proposed making most companies exempt from the rules, which would apply fully only to the largest companies, with slightly smaller companies being subjected to lesser rules.That approach was rejected by the board yesterday. It said auditors should pay attention to the size and complexity of companies, but the same rules should apply to all.As the political pressures grew, even Senator Paul S. Sarbanes, Democrat of Maryland, and Representative Michael G. Oxley, Republican of Ohio, the chief authors of the law, called on the board to take action.“We have done that to the best of our ability,” Mr. Olson said yesterday. “We’ve responded to the message we were hearing loud and clear.”He declined to forecast whether political pressures would ease. “The next move is up to the Congress,” he said.Asked who he expected to object, he replied: “If I were to guess, it would be from either end of the spectrum. It would come either from those who would like large groups of companies totally relieved of 404 compliance, or from some who think we might go too far. The great middle ground will see we have significantly changed the standard to make it more risk-based and principles-based.”An emphasis of the proposed new standard is that it calls on auditors to use a “top-down” approach and identify the areas where fraud or errors are most likely.“This will provide the auditor with flexibility to avoid unnecessary testing,” said Thomas Ray, the chief auditor of the oversight board.That flexibility comes in large part from using what is called “risk-based” auditing, a term some think was abused before the scandals erupted.“In the 90s, risk-based auditing became an excuse to do less work,” said Charles D. Niemeier, a member of the oversight board and a former chief accountant at the S.E.C.’s enforcement division. “That is all it was.” But he said the risk-based approach being urged now was different and deserved support.The board said it would seek public comment for 70 days, after which it would vote on a new rule, which might contain changes in response to the comments. The rule would then need approval of the S.E.C.That means it will be some time before any changes caused by the rule are felt. Willis D. Gradison, a board member who was formerly a Republican congressman from Ohio, said he thought large companies would see cost savings in the spring of 2008. Smaller ones, which have yet to be required to comply with the law, would not benefit until the spring of 2009, because the first-year costs are usually the highest, he said.Those calling for change have blamed Section 404 for leading American companies to go private and for keeping foreign companies from listing securities in the United States.“Hopefully, this will help our capital markets,” said Conrad W. Hewitt, the chief accountant of the S.E.C. “It is a right step forward. Everybody knows it is needed.”'"
"'06-12-20,'0','“It’s a perfect example of bureaucratic ridiculousness,” said Steven Brown, executive director of the Rhode Island branch of the organization. “We have had zero-tolerance cases before, one where a district punished a kindergartner for bringing in a butter knife, and another where a school suspended two first graders who brought a toy ray gun. But this case is even more ridiculous, since Patrick was not even bringing the weapon to school.”The school’s position is particularly untenable, he said, given that the school mascot is a Revolutionary War soldier carrying a rifle.“That’s an entirely different issue,” Mr. Littlefield said. “I don’t think anybody could reasonably construe a cartoon depiction of a soldier from 250 years ago as a threat to our educational environment.”Mr. Agin and his mother, Heidi Farrington, say there is no threat in the chain mail, either, just self-expression.“Historically, the kids have always been encouraged to take their pictures in a self-expressive fashion,” said Ms. Farrington, herself a graduate of the high school. “There was one kid last year on a skateboard, jumping off a set of stairs, and band members who pose with their instrument. I tried to talk to the superintendent, but I didn’t hear back from her for two weeks, several days after I’d gotten in touch with the A.C.L.U.”Mr. Agin comes by his interest in chain mail naturally; his uncle makes chain mail, and his mother sells it at fairs. He also belongs to the Society for Creative Anachronism, which promotes re-enactments of medieval history.The school has offered to let Mr. Agin buy a yearbook ad showing the photo. By itself, that takes the whole situation into the surreal, the civil liberties organization said.“I guess they think it’s a danger to the school system on Page 6, but not on Page 26,” Mr. Brown said.But the school said it had higher standards for editorial content than for advertising.“We believe that our official publications are not necessarily an open public forum for students to express whatever it is they feel,” Mr. Littlefield said. “We see it as our official annual publication, and we reserve the right to exercise some reasonable editorial control over the content.”The lawyer for the school, Stephen Robinson, said the yearbook’s advertising section had traditionally operated under less scrutiny.“There have been two instances in the past of kids wanting to pose with weapons,” he said. “One was a Civil War re-enacter, with a musket, and another was a marksman, and in both cases, we let them take out ads.”'"
"'06-12-20,'0','Ask Mexican immigrants why they risk coming to the United States illegally, and the reasons seldom vary: better wages, plentiful jobs, family ties and future opportunity.“It’s the same things you and I want for our families,” said Demetrios Papademetriou, president of the Migration Policy Institute, a nonpartisan research group in Washington.For most Mexicans, obtaining a visa to live here is next to impossible because either there are too few visas available or the wait is too long. It is also increasingly difficult for Mexicans, particularly poor Mexicans, to obtain tourist visas since the American government tries to screen out people who are likely to remain here illegally.Immigrants who get caught living in the United States without authorization typically face deportation and are barred from re-entering the country legally for as long as 10 years. For most Mexicans, that prohibition does not dissuade them from returning but means daunting complications of time and money. Often they must pay a smuggler to help them cross back into the United States at a cost of thousands of dollars, which can take years to save or pay back.Moreover, immigrants who have been deported once and are caught again can face prosecution and a prison sentence. In recent years, the United States government has been stricter in pursuing these cases to send a message to other illegal immigrants.Increased enforcement along the border in recent years — especially since the Sept. 11 attacks — appears to have deterred few immigrants, Mr. Papademetriou said, but has resulted in a greater demand for smugglers, higher prices for smuggling and more deaths from crossing the border. It has also discouraged people from going back home.A number of Mexicans also enter the United States with border-crossing cards and then remain here, although it is impossible to know how many. The card allows Mexicans to visit for short periods, between 72 hours and 30 days, and they must stay within 25 miles of the border. People often use these cards to make quick shopping trips. More than 732,000 of the cards were issued last year.Today’s new wave of illegal immigrants, many of them with children in tow, has rippled through the nation’s schools. Communities where immigrants gather face challenges to educate children speaking only Spanish whose parents often had limited schooling at home.Because they fill low-wage jobs with no or few benefits, Mexicans also suffer a high poverty rate. In some labor markets, they compete for jobs with the nation’s most disadvantaged, especially young blacks without high school diplomas, scholars at the Center for Labor Market Studies at Northeastern University found.'"
"'06-12-20,'0','Still photographs from the catalog shoot are essentially set in motion here, alternated with airhead interviews with the models, including the bare-chested anorak man, Mark Carroll, who elsewhere on the site confesses that he wants Jessica Simpson under his mistletoe. Profiles of the other models — and easy click from the film — reveal that the A&F lifestyle includes a Chloe handbag and Christian Louboutin shoes, or at least such deluxe fare make the Christmas wishlist of Charlotte Carter Alan, one of the site’s new faces. By contrast Dustin Charapata says he’s hoping for “new clothes from A&F!” for the holidays. Cheers.An edgeless clique of sisterly, slumber-party girls mix it up on ae.com, the site of American Eagle, the cheerful, friendly retailer of mom-approved T-shirts, jeans and hoodies. The company now has underwear too in its Aerie division, which is also the home base of the company’s multimedia task force, which partners with television channels, Webcasts music and video and even plays patron to a team it boldly calls “Aerie artists.”When I looked into the artists, someone named Ben Lee turned up, singing “Since I Met You” in a bland music video. As he plays guitar, the goofy-looking Mr. Lee extols his endearing flaws — flat feet, uneven features, bad ears — while also flaunting them.Simultaneously a supercute girl appears to relish his attention via her iPod; she’s singing along, playing with a female friend, and occasionally rolling around on her bed, fully dressed. In a hoodie! And T-shirt! I have no doubt that the clothes are by American Eagle, and this struck me as refreshing.The Aerie logo appeared at the end of the video, along with “by American Eagle” and “aerie.com,” and — as the curtain dropped — I had the clean, clear feeling of having been advertised to. I did not feel as though I had been shown something kind of like art — a black-and-white film, say — that, while not admitting anything, might obscurely have been laced with some kind of consumerist Spanish fly. I felt as if I had seen an ad. How American, like an eagle.Billboards in Manhattan showing a melancholy brunette in lingerie have suggested that viewers seeking “the full story” turn to hm.com. It’s not easy to find on that Web site, but after some false starts and dead ends — leading to profiles of filmmakers and tours of Paris that seemed to have little to do with the cheap Swedish retailer — I came across a supremely short film in the spirit of Krzysztof Kieslowski’s “Three Colors” series. It stars the same sad, smug woman from the billboards. She speaks not a word, but the video is set to Carla Bruni’s throaty 2002 Eurohit, “Le Plus Beau du Quartier.”To get the woman’s back story, I had a dizzying range of choices, including, no joke, full story: full screen; full story: medium screen; short story: Version 1; short story: Version 2; short story: Version 3. These options also allow an “extended version.” I wish Billboard Lady had just decided for me. In the end I watched them all, and they were all almost exactly the same. I think, from this exercise alone, I might have learned something about women.Or French women at least. The movie shows the beautiful, sultry model — ha! it’s Emmanuelle Béart, who’s now 43! — as she entertains a spectral visitor who seems to enter with the winter wind. First the ghost sweeps down magically, in a glorious shot through the clock face of the Musée d’Orsay, then out over Paris and into the window of her satiny and golden apartment, through its sexy rooms, and onto her wonderfully overdressed bed. Along the way she half-smiles, come-hithering. The reveal, subtly supplied, seems to be that her eager pursuer is in fact a slate-gray cat, though a little jingle bell seems to hint that it might also be Santa Claus.Christmas is not totally forgotten here: the black-and-gold bra set in which she paces her pad is pitched as “Holiday Underwear.” It should not be surprising that there are no kitschy vinyl bustiers, or red-and-fluff ho-ho-ho teddies for the French holiday coquette. Instead Ms. Béart, in the sleepy half light of her flat, looks bemused in her gilded deshabillé, and fetching — though not untouched by time, nor by the cruel-kind technologies of time-fighting.Gudrun Schyman, a member of the Swedish parliament and shareholder in Hennes and Mauritz (of H&M), has protested the “full story” campaign at H&M as something she calls “pornification.” She’s probably right — who can tell? — but a further complaint might be lodged by whoever is paying Ms. Béart’s day rate, as well as shelling out for all this schmancy mise-en-scene. Are the bosses getting their money’s worth with this interactive campaign? Though you get multiple opportunities to stop the film and get information about holiday underwear — the bra is $14.90, the hotpants are $5.90, the collagen is (presumably) priceless — it seems presumptuous to stop the languid beauty in her tracks and stick a price tag on her. And I’m not sure it’s women shopping for bras who are drawn to the video.What’s more, I had real trouble finding it on the site, and the choice of versions was genuinely stupefying. Finally hm.com does not offer users a chance to order directly from the site, so, were I so inspired, I’d still have to find a bustling H&M store to buy my hotpants. And that would mean getting dressed in actual clothes, and leaving my own apartment: an act not at all compatible with the Emmanuelle Béart holiday lifestyle, from what I’ve observed.'"
"'06-12-20,'0','Jay DiGiulio, a founder of Boutique Club International, said he was getting calls from fractional developers eager to link up with a club that will expand their owners’ usage options. “For the first two or three years owners are pretty enamored with where they purchased,” Mr. DiGiulio said. “But they do want the ability to go elsewhere as their needs change. That’s a big appeal for buyers.”And as the fractional market grows, potential buyers and owners are seeing more travel options, with developers now looking at urban markets.“Fractionals remain a very luxury, high-end product,” Mr. Wallace said. “They only work where the local real estate prices start to become unattractive for someone buying a second home. Urban markets might make the most sense because where else is real estate more expensive?”Last fall the St. Regis Residence Club in New York opened on the eighth and ninth floor of the St. Regis Hotel, selling shares that entitle buyers to 28 days a year of use for $252,000 to $750,000. The-two bedroom units are nearly sold out, but one bedrooms and studios remain on the market, said John Teed, the membership executive. Owners at the St. Regis can use their time at any hotel or resort operated by Starwood, which includes other St. Regis sites, the W Hotels and the Sheraton chain.In San Francisco, there are two fractional projects underway that will open in 2007. The Fairmont is building a 54-unit development in Ghirardelli Square under their Heritage Place brand. Fairmont owners can use weeks at other Fairmont hotels and resorts. And the Ritz-Carlton Club, under construction near Union Square, has one-twelfth slices of one- and two-bedroom units starting at $210,000, with twice-daily housekeeping included. Additionally, fractional owners will soon have more swapping options overseas, as hotel companies increasingly develop projects internationally.The Fairmont has developments planned for Turks and Caicos and for Zimbali, South Africa. There are also several fractional projects in the works along the Mexican Riviera in Punta Mita, including properties by the St. Regis and Four Seasons.Even fractional developments that do not operate under a brand are increasingly joining groups that allow owners to use their time at other fractional properties. The Registry Collection operates similarly to the Boutique Club International. Owners at its more than 60 fractional properties in locations as varied as Truckee, Calif.; Edgartown, Mass.; and Tuscany can cash in their time for stays at other resorts in the collection.'"

"'06-12-21,'0','This case has been closely watched for several reasons. For one, organizations with quite disparate interests, from the American Civil Liberties Union to the National Rifle Association, the Chamber of Commerce and the conservative Club for Growth, have argued that they have a right to petition their government and should be exempt from the ban on issue ads as grassroots lobbying groups. Some have contended, most recently in an unsuccessful case before the Federal Election Commission, that their First Amendment rights are infringed upon because the law restricts them from pursuing their policy agendas in election seasons — which often coincide with the height of Congress’s legislative sessions.And the panel’s decision today clearly loosened the clamps on such activities. Those who want to broadcast such ads are “going to push the envelope,” said Professor Edward B. Foley, an election law expert at Ohio State University. “They’re going to explore the scope of this exemption.”The case already had gone to the Supreme Court, but was kicked back to the three-judge panel in January. The justices said the panel had misinterpreted their 2003 decision, in which they upheld the McCain-Feingold law, as foreclosing future challenges to the advertising restrictions.The three-judge panel in the Wisconsin case did not consider the Right to Life group’s argument for an exemption as a grassroots lobbying organization. The 2-1 decision more narrowly found that the group’s ads did not violate restrictions against “express advocacy” for or against a federal candidate and were not campaign ads, but general issue ads. The judges adhered strictly to the content of the actual ads themselves, and rejected arguments by the government that the commercials were intended to influence the election. The ads did not state the senators’ views on the filibusters but urged viewers to call them.The panel found that the government did not demonstrate a compelling enough interest to impose First Amendment restrictions on these groups’ free speech rights. It said this section of the McCain-Feingold law was unconstitutional by imposing campaign finance limits on organizations that were using ads to advance legislative policy.Mr. Foley said the panel’s decision today reopens the door to the use of corporate funds. “This is clearly a shift in direction and invites the use of corporate money,” Mr. Foley said, adding, “You can run ads about any policy issue you want to and you can name members of Congress in the ads. You can use corporate money for any ad that fits this profile.”Mr. Foley said it would appear that the so-called 527 groups that emerged in the 2004 presidential campaign as a powerful force, would also be allowed to use corporate money for general issue ads under the Wisconsin decision. But the law is still murky on the regulation of 527’s, named for the part of the tax code that regulates them.In the Wisconsin case, the Federal Election Commission and others had argued that the Wisconsin ads were clearly intended to try to defeat to Senator Feingold. The group’s opposition to the Senate filibustering of judicial nominees was closely linked to nominees who were anti-abortion.Congressman Chris Shays, Republican and one of the key architects of the campaign finance law, expressed his disappointment today that the judicial panel rejected the broader objectives behind the group’s ads.“The lower court majority opinion ignores a wealth of evidence that shows WRTL had a “priority” to defeat Senator Feingold in the 2004 election, and that the ads in question were part of that effort,” Mr. Shays said in a statement.” That evidence shows that these ads should properly be regulated as “electioneering communications” under the Bipartisan Campaign Finance Act.Fred Wertheimer, head of Democracy 21, a campaign finance group, and one of the lawyers involved in the case, said he was hopeful that the Supreme Court would overturn this decision. “We agree with the dissent in this case,” he said, adding, “that the context surrounding these ads, and not just the text and the face of these ads, must be considered in making this determination.”'"
"'06-12-21,'0','OTTAWA, Dec. 21 — Onex, the Toronto-based investment firm, expanded its presence in the aerospace business today by joining with Goldman Sachs to buy Raytheon’s business-jet division for about $3.3 billion.Raytheon said in July that it was reviewing its plans for the division, as part of a program to focus on government and military aerospace, where profit margins are generally higher.The business-jet unit, which has about 8,500 employees, will be renamed Hawker Beechcraft, after two of the unit’s venerable brand names.The deal is Onex’s third significant aerospace investment. Last year it acquired a component division of Boeing for $1.2 billion, and then sold part of it off again last month in an initial public offering worth $1.4 billion. Onex is also a minority member of the consortium that successfully bid for Qantas Airways earlier this month.Like all-business jet makers, Raytheon’s unit suffered as the market for its products contracted sharply after the terror attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. But it has been profitable for the last three years, earning $142 million in 2005.The unit, which makes Hawker and Premier business jets, had revenues of $2.85 billion last year.As with the purchase of the Boeing unit, it appears that Onex will be entering the business-jet market at the beginning of a growth period. In an annual survey released in October, Honeywell estimated that shipments of business jets were up 26 percent in the first half of this year compared to the same period in 2005. For all of 2006, Honeywell estimates total shipments of 850 business aircraft, and for 2007 it forecasts 1,000 or more. Sales are still rebounding from 2003 lows in North America, and are rising in Asia and the Middle East.Because the unit produces a training jet for the American military and Onex is not an American company, the acquisition is subject to Pentagon approval.'"
"'06-12-21,'0','The principal Thai stock index, which generally moves less than one percent up or down in a day, fell 14.8 percent on Tuesday, rebounded 11.2 percent on Wednesday and fell 2.2 percent today, closing at 676.10. The Thai currency, the baht, whose worrisome run-up against the dollar had helped prompt the central bank’s action, fell 1.6 percent in value against the dollar today, its sharpest decline in three years.The bank imposed the capital controls to stem a surge of speculative inflows into the country, particularly into the bond market. Economists said that policy makers in Bangkok and in other capitals in the region have few other tools at their disposal to alleviate the upward pressure on their currencies from large short-term inflows of capital.“The best thing to do is probably to keep doing what the Chinese are doing,” said James McCormack, senior director at Fitch Ratings in Hong Kong.China does not allow its currency, the yuan or renminbi, to float freely in value. Instead, it maintains a pegged exchange rate by issuing new yuan to buy up foreign currency entering the country in payment for its prolific exports; then it sells bonds to borrow back the yuan it has issued and stem the inflationary impact of the increase in the money supply. This policy has swelled China’s foreign currency reserves to more than $1 trillion.Central banks in other export-dependant Asian nations follow similar policies to varying extents. Japan has amassed $897 billion in reserves, and South Korea $234 billion, though both countries’ currencies are freely traded, unlike China’s. Taiwan, likewise, has $265 billion in reserves. All try to keep their currencies from rising against the dollar and thus making their exports more expensive for foreign buyers.Thailand has amassed foreign exchange reserves of $62.3 billion for the same reason.Another solution, economists said, would be to lower domestic interest rates, making their bonds and other financial assets less attractive to foreign investors.Indonesia has already begun cutting rates, and economists predicted that other central banks around the region would do the same, as long as oil prices do not rise.But on Wednesday, Tarisa Watanagase, governor of the Bank of Thailand, rejected this option, saying it could overstimulate the economy.“The risk of inflation is still there,” she said, adding that foreign capital would still be drawn in by faster economic growth in the country, caused by lower rates.Ultimately, economists have said, the solution for Asia would be to wean itself from too much reliance on exports, by building up domestic investment and demand. That is something Asian governments have been promising to do since the financial crisis of 1997 and 1998, but have never fully tackled.“If we do a proper job of investing in ourselves,” said Supavud Saicheua, an economist at Phatra Securities in Bangkok, “we can live with a stronger baht.”There was evidence today that Thai companies were managing to do just that: the government reported that exports were 20.7 percent higher in November than a year earlier, giving the country a record monthly trade surplus of $1.74 billion.'"

"'06-12-21,'0','“They may just be picking a lot of low-hanging fruit,” Mr. Burnham said.Data that the I.R.S. published this month shows that since 1990, the growth rate in profits reported to shareholders has been more than 50 percent that of profits reported on tax returns, a trend that has happened while Congress has cut the number of tax auditors.The nation’s 12,137 largest corporations, with $250 million or more in assets, earn 87 percent of the profits reported by the nation’s more than five million businesses.About 4,000 of these companies were audited in the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30. If large companies were audited at the same rate as a decade ago, when the auditing staff was a third larger, more than 6,000 of these companies would have had their tax returns examined.Auditors concluded that the 4,000 companies underpaid the government by $13.7 billion, accounting for three-fourths of all the individual and corporate tax cheating uncovered by I.R.S. examinations of returns that year.Prof. Sue Long, a director of the Syracuse clearinghouse, said getting the data used in the research had been a problem. The I.R.S., Professor Long said, initially turned over a small number of pages of data in May after Judge Marsha Pechman of Federal District Court in Washington directed the I.R.S. to resume complying with a 1976 order to make the data available. Later, after she complained, the I.R.S. turned over much more data.Professor Long said the data was a mess. “It took us months to sort it out,” she said.“They told us they had given us all of it, but we noticed from the page numbers in the upper right hand corner that they had not and it turned out they had given us less than 1 percent of the data” that the university researchers eventually received, Professor Long said.In addition, she said, it is difficult to tell if the data is complete because the I.R.S. will not provide an inventory.The agency said it provided more than 200,000 pages of data, covering 56 months starting in October 2001, to the Syracuse researchers. It said the reason that only a small number of pages were turned over last May was a misunderstanding about what data was covered by the court order.Mr. Burnham said that under the previous commissioner, Charles O. Rossotti, the I.R.S. “provided data without requiring a Freedom of Information Act request” while under Mr. Everson litigation has been required to get data.'"
"'06-12-21,'0','It is as plausible an explanation as any. After all, it is not as though G.E. has set new strategy or broken news. When Jeffrey R. Immelt, the chief executive, played host to analysts in New York on Dec. 12, he pretty much reaffirmed what he had said all year.Yes, G.E. will show 2006 earnings of $1.97 to $1.99 a share. Yes, revenue will continue to grow at two to three times the growth rate for the gross domestic product. Yes, it will improve margins and return on invested capital, and increase earnings 10 to 13 percent. Yes, it will finally turn its ailing NBC Universal unit around — and yes, Vivendi will hold onto its 20 percent stake. And yes, G.E. will continue to concentrate on increasing sales in Europe and developing countries.What little news there was would have been more notable in its absence. For example, G.E. said it would raise its quarterly dividend 12 percent, to 28 cents a share. But G.E. has paid a dividend every year since 1899, and this was the 31st consecutive year in which it raised the amount. “It would have been a shock if they had not increased the dividend,” Mr. Dray said.According to Thomson Financial, the consensus among analysts was that G.E. was a good buy before the meeting, and it remained so afterward. “The fundamental outlook in the portfolio is quite strong,” Jeffrey Sprague, an analyst at Citigroup who expects G.E. shares to hit $45, wrote to investors.A few rumors may have bumped up the stock. Last week, Mr. Sprague suggested in a research report that G.E. was poised to sell its plastics business, which has been unable to pass along spiking raw material costs with price increases.That rumor has surfaced before, and Mr. Immelt, as is his wont, has never confirmed nor denied it. But where in the past investors have drawn a blank on a possible buyer, this time many are saying that private equity may step up to the plate.“There’s a lot of private equity money around, and if they finally do sell plastics, that could really drive the stock,” said Timothy M. Ghriskey, chief investment officer at Solaris Asset Management. Solaris does not own G.E. shares now, but Mr. Ghriskey said, “We are continuing to evaluate it as we explore the rumor about a plastics sale.”But even if that rumor turns out to be false, G.E. shares are likely to keep moving up. Mr. Dray of Goldman Sachs now rates G.E. a “conviction buy” — the industrial company in which he has the most confidence for near-term stock appreciation. To him and many other analysts, what has really changed, it seems, is not so much G.E. as the economy in which it functions.Investors tend to frown on conglomerates, and G.E.’s longstanding refusal to pare itself back to a few businesses has often steered investors away from the stock. In each of the past three years, returns to G.E. shareholders have been 9 percent, lagging the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index, which rose nearly 11 percent each year. In contrast, shares of other industrial companies — Mr. Dray mentions Emerson, United Technologies, Danaher and Illinois Tool Works — have soared.But in this type of economy, analysts say, G.E.’s conglomerate status serves as a welcome hedge.Most economists say the American economy is moving into the last gasps of this growth cycle. G.E.’s power generators and aircraft engines, all so-called late-cycle businesses that do well after an extended period of economic growth has forced companies to expand capacity, are still doing robust business.Few analysts expect that to continue much longer. But G.E. has steadily increased the percentage of revenue from services, and even when new-equipment sales slow, analysts expect contracts to maintain existing equipment will start swinging up.Moreover, European economies are strengthening, and countries like China are still in full growth mode. G.E. recently announced a $1 billion deal to sell gas turbines to Saudi Arabia. G.E. is already close to deriving half of its revenue from outside the United States.“Jeff Immelt has aligned G.E.’s portfolio to perform well in an international economy,” Mr. Rosenblatt of Marble Harbor said.Now, Mr. Immelt can only hope investors will continue to realign their portfolios to include more G.E. stock.'"
"'06-12-21,'0','The final piece of the puzzle, which the governor plans to announce on Thursday, is the acquisition of a conservation easement on 51,000 acres upstate in St. Lawrence County from Rayonier, a forestry company.The state will pay $6.5 million for the easement, which will expand hiking, fishing, boating and camping opportunities for the public, and Rayonier will agree to practice sustainable forestry on the land.“It’s something that I have been passionate about since I was a little kid,” Governor Pataki, wearing faded jeans and a baseball cap instead of a pinstriped suit, said in an interview during the hike.“I was like 6 or 7 or 8 years old, and I remember typing with two fingers to all the Western parks commissioners for maps of their state parks and recreation areas, and waiting. All of a sudden these maps would be coming in from Montana and Wyoming. I just always loved the outdoors. I grew up outdoors.”Now, as Governor Pataki prepares to leave office at the end of the year, he spends a lot of time talking about his legacy. He usually talks about crime, tax cuts, the state’s finances and Sept. 11 — issues that can become clouded by questions about who deserves the credit for the drop in crime, or the state’s continuing high tax burden and its long-term fiscal outlook, or the slow pace of redevelopment at the World Trade Center site.To many environmentalists and even to critics, it is Mr. Pataki’s record on land preservation that stands out as his most concrete, perhaps most enduring legacy.“Protecting a million acres of open space is a remarkable achievement for which Governor Pataki deserves enormous credit,” Mr. Spitzer said in a statement. “All New Yorkers have benefited from his vision to preserve natural resources and enhance the state’s great outdoor tradition.”With the new easement agreement in upstate New York, Governor Pataki has secured agreements to protect 1,020,000 acres in New York, from new sections of the Pine Barrens and a new state park in Jamesport on Long Island, to huge swaths of land in the Adirondacks, at a cost of $658.4 million, officials said.Only a little more than half of those agreements are done deals, officials said.All told, the deals protecting 553,721 acres are done; the deals for the rest of the acreage, state officials said, are in the contract phase, or are awaiting complex title searches, or have been purchased by nonprofit conservation groups, which will sell them to the state.The deals were made possible by his successful campaign for a $1.75 billion environmental bond act in 1996 and his decision to set aside money in the budget for environmental projects.While some environmental groups have criticized the governor for not doing more in the areas of regulation and enforcement, the governor’s success in preserving land is almost universally praised by them (although it has met with resistance in some parts of the Adirondacks, which is starved for economic development).For his farewell hike, Mr. Pataki chose Clarence Fahnestock Memorial State Park, a site 50 miles north of New York City that has more than doubled in size during his administration.He led a small entourage of aides and administration members and environmentalists and a couple of state troopers up the granite-flecked trail to Candlewood Hill, stopping along the way to taste some wintergreen leaves. (Being in the Pataki entourage can be a rustic experience: one of his troopers once lost a police radio during an off-trail scramble through a bramble.)Once he reached the top of the hill (followed by his state parks commissioner, Bernadette Castro, who at times seemed less than thrilled by the uphill hike), the governor looked out at a vista of hemlock forests and hills and valleys, with the odd glassy lake, and even a slice of the Hudson. Below was a 261-acre swath of land that he had worked to preserve in 2004 near Oscawana Lake.“They were preparing a subdivision, and had even cut the road,” the governor recalled.Then, although the planned hike was over, the governor let himself be talked into another hike, up one of the hills overlooking Oscawana Lake. Some of the entourage groaned. But from the top, there was a view of 2000 feet along the front of the lake that were preserved.After the hike, over a late lunch, Ms. Harvey, of the Trust for Public Land, asked Mr. Pataki if he saw the environment as his great legacy.“Well, I always say that the most important thing the government does is protect its citizens,” the governor said, discussing the anticrime laws he pushed for and then talking about his fiscal policies.'"
"'06-12-21,'0','A chemical designed by doctors in Los Angeles could give earlier signals of Alzheimer’s disease and provide a new way to test treatments, a study has shown.Currently, the only way to diagnose the disease is to remove brain tissue or to perform an autopsy.The new study, to be published today in the New England Journal of Medicine, is by doctors at the University of California, Los Angeles, and is part of a larger quest to find a better method to diagnose the condition using tracers that can be detected with a positron emission tomography, or PET, scan.The new chemical, called FDDNP, attaches to abnormal clumps of proteins called amyloid plaques and nerve cell tangles that develop in Alzheimer’s sufferers and inhibit messages being processed by the brain.In the study, Dr. Gary Small and his colleagues discovered that the chemical allowed doctors to pick out which of 83 volunteers had Alzheimer’s, which had mild memory problems and which were functioning normally for their age.It was 98 percent accurate in determining the difference between Alzheimer’s and mild cognitive impairment, which surpassed the 87 percent success rate for a PET scan test that measured sugar metabolism in the brain, and the 62 percent accuracy rate when doctors used a magnetic resonance imaging.The FDDNP signal can be seen in people years before they develop Alzheimer’s disease, Dr. Small said.'"

The officers will return the amount either through cash payment or by canceling vested options, the company added.On Nov. 8, the company said that from 1998 to 2005, some officers had chosen past dates as grant dates to use a lower exercise price for their stock options. Subsequently, it filed restated results for the affected periods. The company said it was continuing to cooperate with both the Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission.Juniper Networks, a maker of telecommunications equipment, said that it expected to take a $900 million charge for stock options granted mostly from 1999 to 2003, after completing a seven-month review of its options practices.'"
"'06-12-21,'0','Ms. Tarisa said the biggest failing was a lack of communication with investors when the new rules were announced Monday. “There was not enough communication in English in terms of the details of the regulation,” she said.The bank had been battling to contain a surge of short-term investments into the baht, she said, particularly in the country’s market for corporate bonds and commercial paper.On Dec. 4, the bank issued restrictions on foreign investment in the bond market, but the measures failed to have any impact. The bank then decided to issue blanket restrictions on all foreign investment, Ms. Tarisa said.It gave investors only one day of warning, to prevent them from selling in anticipation of the new rules. But the market’s response was more than the bank had anticipated, she said.The rules required investors to set aside 30 percent of any new investment in an interest-free reserve account for one year, calculating the opportunity cost of doing so at about 1.5 percent.With investors in Thailand earning roughly 20 percent a year, Ms. Tarisa said, “we did not see that as a major factor to scare the long-term investors.”It remains to be seen whether Thailand’s attempt to stem the tide of foreign money will succeed. “It does mean the risk of investing in Thailand has increased,” said Supavud Saicheua, an economist at Phatra Securities in Bangkok. “People won’t forget. When you lose 15 percent in the market in one day, it’s very difficult to forget.”With the United States current-account deficit for the third quarter at a record $225.6 billion and growth slowing, money is pushing into Asia to capitalize on the region’s buoyant economy, particularly in China and India. The surge of funds pushes the value of currencies higher and makes Asian exports more expensive on global markets.James McCormack, senior director at Fitch Ratings in Hong Kong, said this was a regional problem. “Every Asian economy is dealing with currency strength in one way or another, and it’s something they don’t want,” he said. “They’re still export-led economies.”Worsening the problem is China’s pegging of its currency, the yuan, to the dollar, economists say. The yuan does not rise even as China’s trade surplus grows and investment pours into the country, so smaller exporters like Thailand must try to prevent their own currency from rising too quickly or risk losing exports to China.Domestically, the policy reversal this week has taken its toll on the image of Thailand’s military-appointed government, barely two months in office. When it was presented in October, the cabinet was described as a dream team of technocrats untainted by politics and typified by Pridiyathorn Devakula, the finance minister, an American-trained economist who had served as the head of the central bank.That image unraveled this week with the market turbulence.“It’s very unfortunate,” said Korn Chatikavanij, a former investment banker who is deputy secretary general of the Democrat Party. “It’s a reflection of the drawback of having a technocratic government, one that doesn’t quite grasp the world’s realities and the realities of how markets function.”The government must now reckon with the wrath of stock market investors who displayed their anger on newspaper Web sites and in chat rooms. “Pridiyathorn has created a whole lot more enemies from this episode,” The Nation, a Bangkok daily, said in an editorial Wednesday. “His enemies are now picking up their knives.”'"
"'06-12-21,'0','Now that 2006 is just about over, maybe we all need a nice hot bath. Or a cold shower. The former boy-bander Justin Timberlake brought “SexyBack,” while the formerly earnest Nelly Furtado was reborn as a “promiscuous girl.” Akon crooned “I Wanna Love You,” which sounds innocent until you hear the album version. And on Web sites everywhere, the words Britney and Spears have recently been accompanied by the letters N, S, F and W. (As in: not safe for work, unless you work for Larry Flynt.) You could be forgiven for thinking that the world of pop music is smuttier than ever.But look again. The year’s top-selling CD won’t be some lascivious R&B album; it will probably be “High School Musical,” the soundtrack to the Disney Channel movie of the same name, which sold about 3.6 million copies. Billboard calculates from November to November, and it declared the top seller to be “Some Hearts” (Arista Nashville), by the wholesome country singer (and “American Idol” winner) Carrie Underwood. The only other 2006 CD that comes close is another inoffensive country album, “Me and My Gang” (Lyric Street), by Rascal Flatts.Even hip-hop — which generally deserves (and cherishes) its reputation for foul-mouthedness — has been relatively tame this year. The charts were full of playful, though not quite squeaky-clean, dance tracks like “Shoulder Lean” (Young Dro), “It’s Goin’ Down” (Yung Joc) and “We Fly High” (Jim Jones), all accompanied by their own G-rated dance moves. This was the year of kid-tested, parent-approved hip-hop hits like “Chicken Noodle Soup” (by a couple of teenagers, DJ Webstar and Young B) and “Chain Hang Low” (by Jibbs, who turned 16 last month). And “Shortie Like Mine,” the latest single by the not-quite-grown-up rapper Bow Wow, formerly Lil Bow Wow, has hit No. 1 on Billboard’s Hot Rap Tracks chart. His new album, “The Price of Fame” (Sony Urban), arrived in shops on Tuesday, without a Parental Advisory sticker, and it is all but certain to make an impressive debut on next week’s charts.For all those who bemoan the coarsening of popular music (not to mention the dear, perverse souls who celebrate the same), this year’s sales figures complicate the story. Is it possible that our favorite records are getting dirtier and cleaner at the same time?To an enterprising music executive this paradox is no paradox at all. If the number of lascivious pop hits grows, so too does the number of listeners looking for something more Mickey Mouse Club, less strip club. And if it turns out that young consumers — and their parents — are more willing to pay for CDs than teenagers are, that might help explain why the market for family-friendly music still looks pretty healthy.Many rappers have a hard time catering to this market. When he first emerged, Lil Bow Wow hardly seemed designed to please parents. He was discovered by Snoop Dogg, who arranged for him to appear on “Doggystyle,” Snoop Dogg’s debut album. Lil Bow Wow uttered a memorable phrase that you won’t be reading in these pages; the album was released in late 1993, half a year after his sixth birthday.'"
"'06-12-21,'0','At Benjamin Moore’s research center, in Flanders, N.J., Mr. Minchew showed me the results of various tests that, he said, demonstrated Aura’s durability, including one in which a blue enamel surface was painted white with Aura and then scrubbed at least 1,000 times, with little apparent damage. “Obviously, if we had flunked, I wouldn’t show you this,” he said cheerfully.Mr. Minchew said an important impetus for developing the new paint came from an increase in governmental restrictions on V.O.C.’s, “especially in California, which has the most stringent regulations.” As with auto emissions, California took the lead in regulating V.O.C. emissions a few years ago. Among other things, the state restricted paint stores from ordering new supplies of many oil-based paints (which, although long prized by house painters for their appearance and durability, emit considerably more V.O.C.’s than latex paints), and more recently mid-Atlantic states, including New York, have followed suit.Also important to the formulation of Aura, according to Mr. Minchew, was the problem of V.O.C.’s in colorants. Until the 1970s, he said, most paints in the United States were sold off the shelf in stock colors. But as consumers began to demand more color choice, the model shifted to one in which stores stocked cans of “paint base” and added tiny drops of colorants to create thousands of different hues.Companies began producing colorants that would work with any paint base, oil or latex, adding a wide variety of chemical solvents to make the colorants adaptable. These solvents contained V.O.C.’s and “didn’t necessarily make the best paint,” said Barry Chadwick, Benjamin Moore’s vice president for product development.Mr. Minchew said, “We realized that if we made a colorant that only has to go into latex base, and a latex base that only has to work with that colorant, we could make both of them better,” while using fewer V.O.C.-emitting compounds.To sell Aura, Benjamin Moore will need the cooperation of retailers, who will have to decide whether to invest in new machines — which can cost $10,000 or more — that dispense the new paint. (Because Aura colorants dry so quickly, they harden before they can get through a conventional paint dispenser; Mr. Minchew’s team spent three years working with a Finnish company to create a new machine that uses water to keep its nozzles moist.)Because it costs far more than a paint like Regal, which is already considered high-end, Aura has a marketing mountain to climb with consumers. Mr. Chadwick said it has been doing well on the West Coast.Allen Blanson, the assistant manager of East Bay Paints in Albany, Calif., said Aura “has been flying off the shelves” at the store, an independent business that sells Benjamin Moore and Pratt & Lambert paints. But Benjamin Moore executives are waiting to see how East Coast consumers will react to the “super premium” pricing.Michael Pintchik, the president of the family-owned store in Brooklyn that bears his name, said that he was initially concerned that the price would discourage consumers, but now he thinks they may actually save money by using the paint, since one gallon may do the work of two. Mr. Minchew acknowledged that Benjamin Moore could end up selling less paint. “We’d like to think we’re going to get enough people buying our paint, instead of someone else’s, to make up the difference,” he said.'"

"'06-12-21,'0','“This is a ghostly city, if you ask me,” said Sheila Etheridge, a waitress whose home was destroyed and whose three children are staying with relatives near Atlanta. “It gets real spooky when the sun goes down. They let me sleep in the back of the restaurant. But I’ll tell you the truth, we don’t have too many customers. You see what those neighborhoods are like. They’re empty. The people gone.”The recovery in New Orleans has gone about as well as the war in Iraq.In mid-September 2005, with parts of the city still submerged and soldiers from the 82nd Airborne Division on patrol, President Bush made a dramatic, flood-lit appearance in historic Jackson Square. In a nationally televised speech he promised not only to do all that he could to rebuild the Gulf Coast, but also to confront the terrible problem of deep and persistent poverty.“That poverty,” said the president, “has roots in a history of racial discrimination, which cut off generations from the opportunity of America. We have a duty to confront this poverty with bold action.”Now, more than a year later, the population of New Orleans is less than half what it was before the storm. The federal government has allocated billions for the city’s recovery but much of that money has been wasted or remains hopelessly tied up in the bureaucracy. Very little has gotten to the neediest victims, the people who were poor to begin with and then lost their homes and their livelihoods to the storm.Many of the city’s hospitals and schools remain closed. Some will never reopen. There is very little public transportation. The politicians have come up with a stunning array of post-Katrina initiatives, but one grandiose recovery plan after another has faltered.The terrible experience of the flood and its aftermath has left an imprint on the minds of most residents that’s as distinct as the water lines that stain so many of the city’s buildings. A cabdriver’s voice faltered as he told me about an obese woman who put pillows under her arms as the floodwaters were rising. She thought the pillows would help her float.Emotional and psychological problems are rampant, but there is a drastic shortage of mental health professionals to treat them. People are suffering from severe anxiety, depression, schizophrenia and other illnesses. Doctors told me that large numbers of mentally ill individuals have gone more than a year without taking their prescribed medication.Many of the poor residents in the city feel that they’ve been abandoned by the government and the rest of America, and that the president broke his promise to help. “We’re in terrible trouble down here,” said a woman named Delores Goode, who stood outside the Superdome asking passers-by if they knew where she might find work as a baby sitter. “We were all over the television last year. Now we’re back to being nobody.”'"

The scandal centered on damaging, but false, allegations that Mr. Sarkozy had secret bank accounts. The judges said they were questioning Mr. de Villepin, a protégé of President Jacques Chirac, as a witness rather than a suspect. Suspicions that he was involved in the scheme, combined with his shelving of proposed labor reforms that led to violent protests last spring, appear to have dashed his hopes of running for president, while Mr. Sarkozy, widely seen as a victim, emerged strengthened.'"

The acquisition is the latest in a trend of operational integration in the industry, home to some of the world’s most competitive digital camera makers. It follows a merger in 2003 of two rivals that created Konica Minolta Holdings, which has been focusing on medical systems, copiers and other electronics products after selling its digital camera business to Sony this year. Fumio Urano, chief executive of Pentax, said that the two companies would keep their separate brands initially.

"'06-12-22,'0','This case has been closely watched for several reasons. For one, organizations with quite disparate interests, including the American Civil Liberties Union, the National Rifle Association, the Chamber of Commerce and the conservative Club for Growth, have argued that they have a right to petition the government.As grassroots lobbying groups, they say, they should be exempt from the ban on issue ads. Some have contended, most recently in an unsuccessful case before the Federal Election Commission, that their First Amendment rights are infringed upon because the law restricts them from pursuing their policy agendas in election seasons.The court’s decision Thursday clearly loosened the clamps on such activities. Those who want to broadcast such ads are “going to push the envelope,” said Edward B. Foley, an election law expert at Ohio State University. “They’re going to explore the scope of this exemption.”The case has already been heard by the Supreme Court, which kicked it back to the three-judge panel in January. The justices said the panel had misinterpreted a 2003 decision, in which they upheld the McCain-Feingold law, as foreclosing future challenges to the advertising restrictions.The special panel that ruled Thursday did not consider the right-to-life group’s argument for an exemption as a grassroots lobbying organization. The 2-to-1 decision more narrowly found that the group’s ads did not violate restrictions against “express advocacy” for or against a federal candidate and were not campaign ads but general issue ads.The majority opinion was by Judge David B. Sentelle of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit and Richard J. Leon of Federal District Court. Judge Richard W. Roberts of Federal District Court dissented.The judges adhered strictly to the content of the actual commercials and rejected arguments by the government that the commercials were intended to influence the election. The advertisements did not state the senators’ views on the filibusters but urged viewers to call them.The panel found that the government had not demonstrated a compelling enough interest to impose restrictions on these groups’ free speech rights. It said this section of the McCain-Feingold law was unconstitutional because it imposed campaign finance limits on organizations that were using advertisements to advance legislative policy.Mr. Foley said the court reopened the door to use of corporate money.“This is clearly a shift in direction and invites the use of corporate money,” Mr. Foley said, adding: “You can run ads about any policy issue you want to and you can name members of Congress in the ads. You can use corporate money for any ad that fits this profile.”Mr. Foley said it would appear that so-called 527 groups, which emerged in the 2004 presidential campaign as a powerful force, would also be allowed to use corporate money for general issue ads under the Wisconsin decision. But the law is still murky on the regulation of 527’s, named for the part of the tax code that regulates them.In the Wisconsin case, the F.E.C. had argued that the Wisconsin advertisements were clearly intended to try to defeat Mr. Feingold. The group’s opposition to the Senate filibustering of judicial nominees was closely linked to nominees who opposed abortion.Representative Christopher Shays, Republican of Connecticut and a main architect of the campaign finance law, expressed disappointment in the decision.“The lower court majority opinion ignores a wealth of evidence that shows W.R.T.L. had a ‘priority’ to defeat Senator Feingold in the 2004 election, and that the ads in question were part of that effort,” Mr. Shays said in a statement. Fred Wertheimer, head of Democracy 21, a campaign finance reform group, and one of the lawyers involved in the case, said he was hopeful that the Supreme Court would overturn the decision.“We agree with the dissent in this case,” Mr. Wertheimer said, adding, “The context surrounding these ads, and not just the text and the face of these ads, must be considered in making this determination.”'"
"'06-12-22,'0','“Now the negotiations are stopped, and we are waiting for their response,” Mr. Abdullah said. “Honestly, I think an agreement will be very difficult.”As those political moves played out, the new United States defense secretary, Robert M. Gates, met with enlisted men and women in Baghdad to talk about the possibility that more troops could be sent to Iraq. And the American military announced that three more service members had died in Iraq, putting December on a pace to be among the deadliest months of the conflict.Also on Thursday, 38 bodies of Iraqis were found dumped at various sites around Baghdad, apparently the victims of death squads, the Interior Ministry said, and three bombs killed at least 12 and wounded 18.The deadliest of the blasts was a suicide bomb that went off near a police academy just after 7 a.m., a police official said, killing mostly police recruits. A second bomb exploded near a funeral procession in the Amel neighborhood, and another detonated near a passport office.The trial of Saddam Hussein on charges of the killing of tens of thousands of Kurds during the 1980s was adjourned until Jan. 8. Prosecutors told the court that Iraqi soldiers had been ordered to cooperate with Turkish forces in the killings, but the precise nature of an implied agreement between the countries was not spelled out.When a document supposedly describing the agreement was read into the record, the judge ordered the microphone cut off so that reporters could not hear it. Beyond interjecting a few brief comments, Mr. Hussein mostly sat silently.Mr. Sadr’s maneuvers on Thursday were seen by some officials as a possible move to reduce his political and military liabilities as the Americans and their allies pressed to form the bloc meant to marginalize him and perhaps make any attempt to disarm or attack the Mahdi Army more politically palatable.At the moment, Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki owes his power to a coalition that includes a major contingent led by Mr. Sadr, complicating any move against the cleric or his Mahdi Army militia.Mr. Sadr was also said to be ready to allow his allies to rejoin the government after a three-week boycott, The Associated Press reported.The walkout, including 30 lawmakers and six cabinet officials, was a protest against Mr. Maliki’s meeting with President Bush in Jordan, and it has kept Mr. Maliki’s government from passing legislation. Any return by the politicians would make it more likely that Mr. Sadr could keep some influence in the government even if a new cross-sectarian governing bloc was approved.“Within two days, the Sadr movement will return to the government and Parliament,” said Abdul Karim al-Anizi, a lawmaker from Mr. Maliki’s Dawa faction, according to The Associated Press. Two allies of Mr. Sadr’s who were not identified also said the politicians would return.Although there were hints on Thursday that the Sunni Arab Iraqi Islamic Party might reconsider some of its demands, if taken at face value they would almost certainly scuttle the formation of the unity bloc because they could never be met in the spoils system of Iraqi politics.In that system, the ministries are doled out to parties that won various shares of the vote in the last elections, and top ministry posts are given to members of those parties.In Baghdad, Mr. Gates talked to enlisted service members on the second day of his visit to Iraq. A majority of the troops at the meeting signaled that they supported the idea of sending more American forces to Iraq, a proposal that has emerged as a leading option as the Bush administration considers a strategy shift.“I really think we need more troops here,” said Specialist Jason T. Glenn. “With more presence here,” he said, security might improve to a point that “we can get the Iraqi Army trained up.”On Wednesday, American generals expressed concern about such a plan, saying that sending more troops would make Iraqis less likely to take responsibility for security.After a meeting with Mr. Maliki and other senior Iraqi officials, Mr. Gates said that he had discussed “the possibility of some additional assistance” but that there had been no mention of specific numbers of additional American troops.Mr. Gates told the troops that the administration was putting together a package of ideas for reversing sectarian violence, including procedures for delivering reconstruction assistance quickly to places where the military had conducted operations to clear out insurgents and militias.Mr. Gates said the first assistance to a neighborhood should come “within hours” of such a clearing operation, to show residents the tangible benefits of rejecting militants and backing the government.It was not clear how the troops who met with Mr. Gates had been selected, but in a show of hands he requested, about half said they were serving their second tour in Iraq and the rest said they were on their first.Several said the Iraqi Army and police were improving but were not competent enough for the Americans to shift to a supporting role. Many do not show up regularly for work, they said, and some tip off insurgents and militias about military operations.'"
"'06-12-22,'0','The best tables at “21” were in the original building; the outer-room Siberias opened when the restaurant expanded two doors down on 52nd Street. Mr. Berns knew who sat where, whether it was Ernest Hemingway, Frank Sinatra or Humphrey Bogart, who proposed to Lauren Bacall in the restaurant.More than once, his daughter said, Mr. Berns averted disaster by making sure that the third party in a love triangle was seated out of sight.Mr. Berns saw “21” evolve from a clandestine saloon to a grand salon. Before World War II, writers and actors and slumming millionaires drank elbow-to-elbow. Groucho Marx might rub shoulders with J. Paul Getty. After the war, the scene began to shift to brokers, bankers and the business elite.The rooms smelled of cigars and money. The place practically invented the power lunch. It was very likely the first restaurant to charge $21 for a hamburger, a pinnacle it hit 21 years ago. It was perhaps the priciest place in the world to chow down on chicken hash.The menu became fancier but the aura faded after the Berns and Kriendler families sold the restaurant to a business magnate in 1985 for $21 million. But “21” was never about the food. It was about the mood.Herman Jerome Bernfeld was born on Feb. 19, 1907, one block north and five blocks west of “21” in the Hell’s Kitchen section of Manhattan. His parents had emigrated from what is now Poland. His father, Abraham, was a tinsmith who made the old-fashioned ceilings still found in Manhattan tenements.His brother, Charlie, ran a string of speakeasies that were “21” precursors. His mother, Sophia, demanded that Jerry leave Columbia College to avoid the risks of running rum in New York. Sent to Ohio, Mr. Berns received an undergraduate degree in English from the University of Cincinnati in 1929.His first wife, the former Martha Baeffsky, died in 1976 after 45 years of marriage. Their daughter Diane died in 1986. He married Suzanne Pogany in 1977; she died in 2000. In addition to Mrs. Rosenthal, he is survived by his wife, the former Dorothy Lyons, whom he married in 2005; six grandchildren and six great-grandchildren. Charlie Berns died in 1970; H. Peter Kriendler in 2001.The club opened at its present address on New Year’s Day 1930. In 1938, Jerry Berns, then the drama critic for The Cincinnati Enquirer, left the footlights of the Midwest for the grander stage on 52nd Street. For more than 12,000 nights thereafter, he was the first man the guests of the “21” Club met after they checked their hats and coats.'"

"'06-12-22,'0','The special group has attended orientation sessions on topics like delivering constituent services and getting their names regularly into local newspapers.The sessions were led by members of Congress who have won in tough districts, including Representative Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, the new head of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.Several said they were being told that given a choice of voting the party position and casting a vote that would help them in their districts they should feel free to retreat from the Democratic line.“Everybody has a responsibility to help these guys — in their districts, on their votes, on their legislation — make sure they come back,” said Representative Rahm Emanuel of Illinois, who preceded Mr. Van Hollen as head of the Democrats’ campaign committee and is now fourth in the Democratic leadership in the House.The concern is not merely theoretical. Already, in Connecticut, Representative Rob Simmons, a Republican who lost his seat to Joe Courtney, a Democrat, by fewer than 100 votes, has signaled that he will try to win back the seat in 2008.Ron Klein, a Florida Democrat who defeated E. Clay Shaw Jr., a 13-term Republican, said the tenuousness of his standing, and the need to start preparing now, had been drilled into him since he arrived here.“You’re running in two years,” Mr. Klein said. “The campaign starts now, and you need to be prepared. We’re not wasting time.”Tim Walz, a Democrat who toppled a six-term Republican in Minnesota, learned that he was part of the so-called Retention Club when he ran into Mr. Emanuel, whose new duties include overseeing the program, at a meeting for Democratic members at a Capitol Hill party two weeks ago. Mr. Emanuel gave him precise advice, Mr. Walz recalled.“ ‘Start raising money now,’ ” Mr. Walz said Mr. Emanuel told him. “ ‘And here’s your goal. Have $1 million in the bank by the time this race gets ready next time.’ ”The urgency of the effort reflects the narrow margins that the new majority was built on. Even though the Democrats picked up 30 seats, many of those were by margins of less than five percentage points.In addition to Mr. Courtney, the new members with the thinnest of margins of victory included Patrick Murphy, who won by slightly more than 1,500 votes in Pennsylvania.And at least five on the list won in districts where Republicans had been caught up in controversy. They include Nick Lampson, who took the seat that Representative Tom DeLay once had in Texas; Zack Space, who captured the seat held by Bob Ney in Ohio; and Tim Mahoney, who will fill the position held by Mark Foley in Florida.“Our focus is to make sure that each member strengthens his or her standing back home by offering strategic advice and help,” said Brendan Daley, a spokesman for Mrs. Pelosi, who is planning weekly breakfasts with this group. “That can be legislative, message or outreach tuned into the needs of their district.”The situation is different in the Senate, because the Democrats who won by small margins — notably Jim Webb in Virginia and Claire A. McCaskill in Missouri — do not face re-election for six years.Democrats are instead focusing on incumbents who face tough campaigns in two years, said Senator Charles E. Schumer, the New York Democrat in charge of his party’s campaign effort.The list of potentially endangered Democratic senators includes, as of two years out, Tim Johnson of South Dakota, Mary L. Landrieu of Louisiana and Mark Pryor of Arkansas.To bolster their résumés, many in the group of vulnerable House Democrats have been rewarded with committee assignments tailored to their districts, assignments that have already won the new members flattering articles in their hometown newspapers.“Connecticut’s freshmen congressmen will have plum committee assignments when the 110th Congress opens for business in January,” The New Haven Register said of Mr. Courtney’s posting to the Armed Services Committee and Chris Murphy’s assignment to the Government Reform Committee.Nancy Boyda of Kansas, who startled Democrats by winning with 51 percent of the vote, was given her first choice, Armed Services, after, she said, she informed Democratic leaders of the prevalence of veterans in a district that had largely escaped Democratic notice until the final week before Election Day.“They are doing everything they can to match up my district with committee assignments,” Ms. Boyda said. “That has been a huge help.”House Democratic aides said the group would be named sponsors of bills that Mrs. Pelosi is planning to press through in the first 100 hours in office, in particular, raising the minimum wage, expanding stem cell research and toughening rules on lobbying and ethics.Mr. Space, Mr. Lampson and Mr. Mahoney are all expected to help lead the debate on ethics legislation, reflecting the circumstances of their victories.“The most important thing for these members is for them to go back home two years from now and say they followed through on the agenda they talked about, especially in those districts where you had Republican incumbents who were involved in various scandals,” Mr. Van Hollen said.Orientation for these new members included training in working with the news media, seminars on responding (or not) to questions from local reporters and pointers on keeping the highest visibility in their district, even under a schedule that will require them to be in Washington five days a week.At one meeting, Mr. Emanuel told how he made a practice of sitting in front of a Chicago grocery store for three hours meeting constituents and how his office set up tax clinics to help constituents deal with filling out tax forms.'"

"'06-12-22,'0','UNITED NATIONS, Dec. 21 — A businessman pleaded guilty Thursday to providing cash and a significantly discounted luxury Manhattan condominium to a ranking United Nations procurement official, in a successful effort to win more than $50 million in contracts, federal prosecutors said.The businessman, Nishan Kohli, 30, pleaded guilty in Manhattan federal court to a single count of bribery after acknowledging that he had given cash payments to Sanjaya Bahel, who was chief of the commodity procurement section of the United Nations procurement division from 1998 until 2003. Mr. Kohli faces up to 10 years in prison.He also acknowledged that from 2003 to 2005, he allowed Mr. Bahel to pay reduced rent at a high-rise apartment that Mr. Kohli owned in the Dag Hammarskjold Towers, near United Nations headquarters. In May 2005, Mr. Kohli sold the unit to Mr. Bahel at a price so far below the market value that the condominium’s board considered blocking the sale, prosecutors said. Mr. Kohli also gave Mr. Bahel a cellphone that allowed them to speak privately.Mr. Kohli’s guilty plea is the latest development in a series of corruption charges against United Nations officials and those seeking to do business with them. The plea and Mr. Kohli’s agreement to cooperate with the government are likely to strengthen the case against Mr. Bahel, who has pleaded not guilty to bribery charges. His trial is scheduled for May 7.Richard Herman, Mr. Bahel’s lawyer, said his client had accepted no bribes and was “vigorously fighting the allegations of any wrongdoing.” Mr. Herman noted that the condominium sale took place two years after Mr. Bahel, 56, left his procurement position and said that the contracts in question were awarded through a “sealed bid process.”Mr. Bahel has been suspended without pay from his latest position, as chief of the commercial activities service within the United Nations postal administration, for four months since an internal United Nations investigation found he had improperly steered contacts toward Mr. Kohli’s companies.Stéphane Dujarric, a spokesman for Secretary General Kofi Annan, said that the prosecutors’ case was “based in large part on evidence uncovered by the United Nations,” adding, “We very much welcome the fact that people who have been accused of wrongdoing involving the U.N. are being brought to justice.”'"

Mr. Surayud said he supported the central bank’s Monday decision, calling the revisions announced by the finance minister a modification, not a reversal.But his reassurances only deepened concern about the future of foreign investment in Thailand in the wake of the September coup that ousted Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, a prominent executive.“If Thaksin had been there, this wouldn’t have happened,” said Song Seng Wun, a regional economist at CIMB-GK Research in Singapore. “Being a business person in charge of listed companies, he would have known what the effect would be.”'"

"'06-12-22,'0','And the draft rules do not require any specific security measures, like the construction of barriers or a switch to less hazardous chemicals. Instead, they will leave it up to plant owners to decide what measures are most appropriate, although the Homeland Security Department will review the plans and have the power to order changes.Democrats, who failed this year in an effort to mandate more stringent requirements, said that they intended to take up the issue next year, when they will have the majority.“It concerns me that the regulations do not require chemical facilities to switch to safer technologies wherever feasible,” said Representative Bennie Thompson, Democrat of Mississippi, who is to take over as chairman of the House Committee on Homeland Security. “Without such a requirement, I fear a significant gap remains in our chemical security efforts.”Scott Jensen, a spokesman for the American Chemistry Council, said the organization’s members, which include industry giants like Dow Chemical and DuPont, welcomed the regulations, particularly if they would credit security investments already made by plant owners, which he said had cost more than $3.3 billion nationwide.“We want to make sure that work is recognized when it comes to complying with the new regulations,” he said.Rick Hind, a lobbyist for the environmental group Greenpeace, called the regulations “an industry-friendly excuse so they can claim they are doing something.”The debate over the need for chemical plant regulations began shortly after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. Unlike nuclear power plants or ports, facilities that manufacture or store large quantities of toxic chemicals are not subject to antiterrorism mandates.Christie Whitman, the former administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, said after she left the agency that its efforts to enact such regulations had been held back by the White House, under pressure from the chemical industry.The Bush administration and the chemical industry joined with Democrats in calling for regulations because even though the industry had voluntarily adopted security standards, some plants were not abiding by them.The new regulations, which Congress ordered as part of the 2007 Homeland Security budget act, would require that facilities that manufacture, use or store chemicals evaluate all the ways they could be attacked — from outside the plant, or by sabotage from the inside — and then propose countermeasures.“We are not going to tell them, ‘You have to build a big fence as opposed to putting a tank underground,’ ” Mr. Chertoff said. “We are simply going to say, ‘The choice you make must prevent somebody from being able to shoot the tank and blow it up.’ ”Only “high risk” plants are subject to the mandate, although the draft rules do not yet define exactly what that term means, making it impossible to say how many facilities will be subject to the regulation.Plants that are affected will have to conduct background checks on employees and take at least some steps to control access, secure chemical stockpiles and establish emergency plans in the event of an attack. Plants that ignore the requirements may be subject to fines of up to $25,000 a day or face a shut-down order.The proposed rules do not explicitly pre-empt state plant security laws, like one adopted last year in New Jersey that requires facilities to consider switching to safer chemicals or technologies. But the draft regulations say the Homeland Security Department may take such a step to “preserve chemical facilities’ flexibility to choose security measures.”'"
"'06-12-22,'0','A dozen real estate funds are already active in St. Petersburg alone, where prices doubled this year in residential property, the fastest-growing segment. Rreef, the real estate arm of Deutsche Bank, for instance, plans to invest $500 million in new residential property. Ruric, a Swedish fund, has $100 million to invest.Russian real estate companies raised $2.75 billion in initial and secondary stock offerings this year and are aiming for the same amount in 2007. Investors are trying to scoop up everything from office towers to cow pastures as sites for the new malls that are popping up around Russia’s larger cities.In fact, property prices are rising so rapidly that by some accounts from local brokers, 30 percent of apartments were bought last year not as family homes, but as investments by companies or individuals.In Moscow, prices are higher than in St. Petersburg but rose less quickly. The average per-square-foot price of residential property rose 89 percent, to $386 from $204 last December, according to IRN, an index of real estate prices used by Russian brokers. By comparison, the average price per square foot for residential properties in Manhattan rose 6.6 percent, to $1,050, in the third quarter this year compared with the same period last year, according to Miller Samuel Inc., a real estate appraisal firm in New York.Commercial real estate prices are not increasing as swiftly but are still high. Returns on real estate beat even the sizzling Russian Trading System index, which is up 62 percent this year, according to CB Richard Ellis, a Los Angeles firm that tracks global office rent.“The macroeconomics are so strong now that investors are viewing Russia as a long-term market,” Darrell Stanaford, director of CB Richard Ellis’s local joint venture, said in a telephone interview. “Restraints on development are another plus for prices.”Foreign funds typically look for newly built office space in St. Petersburg and Moscow only, but there are few such properties. St. Petersburg, however, has 120,123 units or 113.3 million square feet of residential property tied up in communal apartments that house about 700,000 people, like Ms. Mailyan, according to the city.At prevailing prices of $272 a square foot, that represents roughly $30 billion in real estate tied up in communal apartments. It is the city’s stated policy to resettle all residents of communal apartments.As for investors looking for office buildings, “they quickly learn there’s very little, almost nothing,” Kurt E. Stahl, marketing director of the Jensen Group, a St. Petersburg developer, said. “We are getting a lot of calls from hedge funds that are interested. We didn’t have that before.”The market is also abuzz with big deals. A syndicate of five Chinese state-owned companies is developing a 553-acre plot outside St. Petersburg for $1.3 billion. Outside Moscow, Limitless, the real estate arm of DP World, announced plans for a 44,000-acre, $11 billion mixed development.The most peculiarly Russian real estate play, however, is the communal apartment.After the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution, Communist authorities resettled working-class families into aristocratic buildings in cities throughout Russia and Ukraine. The practice was most widespread in St. Petersburg.The original owners were exiled, shot or elbowed into rooms in their former homes. Unlike in Eastern Europe, Russia offers no recourse for prerevolutionary owners to regain title — a good thing for new buyers.Communal apartments, often home to at least one alcoholic along with children of all ages, slowly drive those who live there crazy from lack of privacy, residents say.Ms. Mailyan raised three daughters in the master bedroom she moved into with her parents when she was 12 years old.“When I was young it was fun,” she said. Seven families lived in the 2,270-square-foot apartment on 14 Blokhina Street back then. “There were lots of kids around all the time.”There were hard times, too. “Sasha was a drunk, but he was a quiet drunk,” she said of a man who lived with his wife and daughter in a room off the kitchen. Drawing on a cigarette, she confided her view of life in a communal flat: “I don’t like my neighbors.”Recently, the value of such properties has reached dizzying heights, particularly compared with low Russian salaries. Apartments of similar size on Blokhina Street have sold for $600,000 and more, and foreign investors are driving the prices up.Investment money is flowing in other ways, too. Russian developers have listed shares on the London Stock Exchange. Systema-Hals raised $396 million in a London offering earlier this year.The nickel and mining tycoon Vladimir O. Potanin raised $881 million in a secondary stock offering in September for a developer. Gazprom, the natural gas monopoly, is active in St. Petersburg real estate speculation through affiliated companies.In July, the Jensen Group closed a $100 million fund subscribed by American university endowments and high-net-worth individuals. But for an investor, leveraging value out of communal flats is complex and risky.Buying a communal apartment is a complex procedure: the investor must first buy three or four small apartments on the outskirts. Then the communal flat dwellers swap their rooms for these apartments, and the deal is closed. Thus, the price the buyer pays depends on the going rate for second-rate property in outlying districts.Simmering resentments among residents often complicate the deals. Ms. Mailyan and her neighbor, Dmitri S. Savin, have lived down the hall from one another since 1974, yet decided to sell separately rather than reconcile their arguments.Asked what prevented a combined sale — which theoretically would leave both with a greater share of the value of the apartment — Mr. Savin made a looping gesture around his ear and pointed toward Ms. Mailyan’s room.Lisa Kreutz, a real estate agent for Pulford in St. Petersburg, is a practiced hand at the delicate deal-making that untangles communal apartments, eventually putting them up for sale to foreign buyers.A former ballerina with the Fort Worth Ballet who moved to St. Petersburg a decade ago after marrying a dancer with the Kirov Ballet, she coaxes residents into swapping their room for a home of their own, then refurbishes the space.“For those of us who’ve been here a while, we know how afraid people were” of these deals, Ms. Kreutz said in an interview. “It was just an adventure, a dream, before. Now, investors are buying.”The business has also straightened out a bit since the chaotic 1990s, she said. Then, midway through a deal, some communal apartment residents found there was no private apartment waiting for them. Instead, “people got killed or bopped on the head,” she said.This being Russia, though, the risks have not gone away entirely.Residential real estate deals are often accompanied by a peculiarly Russian type of due diligence, where buyers ask doctors to certify, at the time of signing, that the seller is sober. It is not an empty precaution: Former owners returned years later and persuaded judges to void deals on the grounds they were on a bender at the time of the closing. This protection for the inebriated is written into Russian law.In these cases, Yulia Matygina, a Moscow real estate lawyer, said, “The buyer loses the apartment.”'"
"'06-12-22,'0','WASHINGTON, Dec. 21 (AP) — President Bush issued 16 pardons on Thursday and commuted the sentence of an Iowa man who had been convicted on drug charges.Five of the pardons were in cases that involved drug crimes. Other cases involved bank fraud, mail fraud, the acceptance of a kickback, a false statement on a loan application and conspiracy to defraud the government over taxes.Seven of the 16 received no prison or jail time when they were sentenced, instead getting probation or a reduction in their military pension.The longest sentence was nine years, for aiding cocaine distribution, followed by a six-year term for conspiracy to possess marijuana.A White House spokesman, Tony Fratto, said Mr. Bush had issued 113 pardons and commuted three sentences in his nearly six years in office.'"
"'06-12-22,'0','BEIJING, Dec. 21 — The top American envoy at arms control talks here on Thursday called for North Korea to negotiate the dismantling of its nuclear weapons program without insisting that the United States first lift financial restrictions it had placed on North Korea.The envoy, Assistant Secretary of State Christopher R. Hill, said North Korea’s determination to link nuclear disarmament with the financial restrictions was an obstacle to solving what had become a “very urgent problem” since North Korea tested a nuclear device on Oct. 9.“We have made it very clear that we consider the financial issue quite separately from the denuclearization issue,” Mr. Hill said. “I would rather not obscure that problem by talking about finances.”After four days of six-nation talks in the Chinese capital, it was clear that North Korea’s top priority was to restore its access to the international banking system.The United States angered North Korea in September 2005 when it began investigating Banco Delta Asia, a bank in the Chinese territory of Macao that handled transactions with North Korean government companies and other entities linked to it.'"
"'06-12-22,'0','“He was contentious,” Mr. Wiley said. “He disagreed and we disagreed. We said, ‘You approved this for all those years.’ He said, ‘Well, things have changed.’ ”That is not quite the way Deloitte recalls it. In filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Deloitte says it did not trust what two Navistar financial officials told it, and recites a long list of failings in Navistar accounting, including a number of areas where Deloitte questioned whether costs had been wrongly deferred, a move that would inflate profits. The auditor said it suspected it had been misled about some transactions.In April, a couple of months after the audit should have been completed, Navistar fired Deloitte, and all this dirty linen was aired. KPMG was hired to finish the audit and to reaudit previous years’ statements that the company no longer deemed reliable.No one seemed to be very much alarmed about that. Banks lent money to allow Navistar to pay off bonds that were in default as a result of its failure to file financial results, and the stock went up.But then the company said that KPMG would not be able to complete the 2005 audit by the Jan. 31 deadline for completion of the 2006 audit, as previously promised. The New York Stock Exchange said the company would be delisted, and S.& P. dropped it from its index. The stock slumped on sales by index funds.Navistar, which has traded on the New York Exchange since 1908, managed to stay listed with an appeal. It was based on a Big Board rule — hurriedly adopted a year ago to avoid a delisting of Fannie Mae — that gave the exchange the right to waive rules requiring financial statements if delisting of a delinquent filer would be “contrary to the national interest.” Who’s to say school buses are less important to the country than home mortgages?The Big Board, under pressure from the S.E.C., has decided to drop the Fannie Mae rule, but not until the end of 2007. It is up to the Big Board appeals panel to decide if Navistar will be able to stay listed until then.What is clear is that there are a lot more companies with problems now than in the past, and those problems are harder to resolve. Auditors are more careful than they used to be, and arguments that a disputed figure is too small to matter are less likely to be accepted.The Nasdaq market historically has been quicker to delist than the Big Board, partly because it swings into action when a quarterly filing is late rather than waiting for a delinquent annual filing. But with two of its largest companies, Apple and Dell, now unable to file because of options backdating issues, it is showing more willingness to delay action.It can be argued that innocent shareholders suffer if a company is forced to leave the New York or Nasdaq markets and move to the Pink Sheets, where few companies of any quality are traded. But not enforcing delisting rules removes an incentive to complete filings as rapidly as possible.As a result, companies can now keep trading on major markets while giving out only the numbers they choose to release. Sometimes those numbers seem to be chosen to make the company look good, which can seem unfair to competitors that must meet all the normal rules.Delinquent filers like Krispy Kreme, the doughnut company, and Take-Two Interactive Software, the video game developer, have done well in the market since they stopped releasing current financial data, and so has Fannie Mae. Investors do not seem bothered by not having full information.For a country that claims to have the most transparent markets in the world, the result seems a little odd.'"
"'06-12-22,'0','THE Northeast has not exactly been blanketed with snow this year, but Stratton Mountain Resort in Vermont has stayed open. Temperatures have been below freezing, which lets Stratton make the necessary tons of snow.But that is only half the battle.“If people don’t see the snow on the ground in New York City,” said Jeremiah Greco, a spokesman for Stratton Mountain, “they’re not going to come up here.”So Stratton has decided to give lift tickets to customers — no matter where they are from — who reserve a room at the Inn at Stratton Mountain from Dec. 26 Tuesday to Dec. 31. Customers will receive a pair of lift tickets for each night spent at the hotel.In an e-mail message to potential customers last Monday, Stratton told them they could save up to $150 a day. Mr. Greco acknowledged on Tuesday that the mild winter was a factor in offering the package. “It’s to entice the people to make the trip and see what we do have here,” Mr. Greco said in a telephone interview. “If they don’t feel the chill, it’s hard to think about the winter.”Many other Northeast resorts, inns and ski areas plan to offer nothing more than the packages they usually offer the week after Christmas, the unofficial start of the ski season in the Northeast.

"'06-12-23,'0','Mr. Gao’s relatively light sentence may reflect his status as a leading dissident with relatively wide recognition among human rights groups overseas. His supporters in China have publicized his case and the plight of his family, whose members they say have suffered beatings and harassment by the security police.But through the official news agency, the authorities presented Mr. Gao as cooperative, saying he had provided evidence that could be used against other opposition figures. “Gao also voluntarily reported others’ offenses and provided important clues for cracking other cases, a contribution to win him a lenient penalty and a reprieval of five years,” the agency said.Hu Jia, a rights advocate who has maintained close ties to Mr. Gao, said officials mainly intended to reduce his influence.The sentence deprives him of his “political rights,” which is often interpreted to include the freedom to publish or speak out on sensitive topics, for one year. It also places him under heavy scrutiny for another four years. “He will be a prisoner in his own home,” Mr. Hu said. “The sentence is better than we expected. But it is designed so that he will not be able to express himself in public.”“This is a clever move by the leadership,” he added. “They can appear as though they are responsive to overseas opinion. But they also see that Gao’s influence will be diminished or eliminated within China.”In the past two years, Mr. Gao established himself as an uncompromising critic of party leaders. Some other critics of the ruling party considered his style tactless, but he maintained a following in the rights protection movement and among supporters of Falun Gong.The circumstances of Mr. Gao’s arrest and trial are even murkier than is usual in China’s opaque legal system. After his arrest in August, Mr. Gao sent a letter to some supporters saying he did not wish to have any legal representation. The authorities did not allow the defense lawyer retained by his family on his behalf, Mo Shaoping, to meet with Mr. Gao or to represent him in court.Two people connected with the case said that either as a legal tactic or under heavy police pressure, Mr. Gao probably confessed to at least some of the charges against him.The police and prosecutors rely heavily on confessions in criminal cases. Chinese and foreign legal experts say the police routinely force suspects to confess to the charges against them. Judges generally give lighter sentences to those who do.The New China News Agency, in announcing the verdict, said Mr. Gao had been accused of posting nine “seditious articles,” including one titled “The Regime Has Never Stopped Killing People,” on overseas Web sites like Epochtimes.com and SecretChina.com.The agency quoted the court as saying, “In the articles, Gao defamed and made rumors about China’s current government and social system, conspiring to topple the regime.”Mr. Gao also granted 10 interviews to overseas news organizations, the agency said. It did not make clear why granting interviews constituted subversion.'"
"'06-12-23,'0','MOSCOW, Dec. 22 — Gazprom, the Russian natural gas monopoly, agreed on Friday to continue supplying gas to Georgia, but at double the price, the latest increase for a pro-Western nation on Russia’s border.Aleksandr I. Medvedev, Gazprom’s deputy chief executive, said three Georgian importers had agreed to buy gas at the company’s asking price of $235 for 1,000 cubic meters, close to that paid by richer nations in Europe.The latest contract is considered short term. Gazprom notes that the contract does not cover all of the country’s needs and that it could still cut off supply. And Georgia says that it is close to obtaining an alternative supply from a BP-run platform in the Caspian Sea off of Azerbaijan, Georgia’s eastern neighbor.That option for Georgia, a country trying to keep from being bullied by the company’s politically tinged pricing practices, comes as American policies of supporting pipeline routes that skirt Russia are coming to fruition. That move deprives Gazprom of its monopoly in the south Caucasus. Georgia says it will be mostly free of Russian gas by 2008.Georgians still see a political motive behind Gazprom’s increase, which the company sought in November at the same time Russia imposed other sanctions on Georgia. The restrictions include bans on wine, mineral water and fruits and vegetables and a suspension of air, rail and roadway links.'"
"'06-12-23,'0','LOS ANGELES, Dec. 22 (Reuters) — A former aide to Judith Regan, the recently fired editor of O. J. Simpson’s unpublished memoir “If I Did It,” has come forward to defend the maverick publisher from charges of anti-Semitism, Ms. Regan’s lawyer said on Friday.The publishing company HarperCollins fired Ms. Regan last week and has quoted her as having complained in an argument with a company lawyer that she was the victim of a “Jewish cabal” after her book deal with Mr. Simpson, and a related Fox network TV interview, were scrapped by the parent corporation, the News Corporation. But an aide who worked as Regan’s temporary assistant for one week, Carmen del Toro, has offered an account of the conversation, which contradicts the account of anti-Semitic remarks, according to Ms. Regan’s lawyer, Bert Fields.“An independent third-party witness heard the conversation and says that Judith Regan is telling the absolute truth, that she did not make the anti-Semitic remark attributed to her,” Mr. Fields said.Ms. del Toro recounted instead that Ms. Regan had said she “felt a ‘cabal’ had been formed against her within the company,” Mr. Fields said. He added that HarperCollins “couldn’t find a legitimate way to get rid of Judith, so they made one up.”In both the book and accompanying TV special, Mr. Simpson was to have described, hypothetically, how he would have carried out the 1994 stabbing deaths of his former wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend, Ronald Goldman.'"
"'06-12-23,'0','She had more than a deep knowledge of dogs, though; she had a way with them.“Dogs responded to her,” Mr. Bradley said. “As a judge, she was authoritative and friendly. Some dogs who were shown to her many times would even recognize her. They would wag their tails when they saw her.”Born in 1929 in Flushing, Queens, Anne Rogers was the great-granddaughter of a 19th-century mayor of New York, Philip Hone, and a second-generation dog person. Her mother, who ran a kennel in Pound Ridge, N.Y., started a successful dog department at Abercrombie & Fitch, then opened a grooming service in Manhattan called Dogs Inc.Turning down a scholarship to the veterinary school at Cornell, Anne Rogers joined her mother’s business after high school, then took to the show ring as a handler. She won her first best in show at Westminster in 1956, handling a toy poodle, Ch. Wilbur White Swan, the first dog from the toy group to win top honors there.She turned to judging in 1967, two years after retiring as a handler. Although she said she was possibly the slowest judge in American Kennel Club history during her first few years, by 1973 she had worked her way to Westminster to judge the toy group. She judged the best in show in 1978.Mrs. Clark was also a winner at Westminster as a breeder. She and her husband, James, captured non-sporting-group honors with their standard poodle Ch. Rimskittle Ruffian in 1980. In 2002, her miniature poodle Ch. Surrey Spice Girl, which she bred with Barbara Furbush and her protégé Kaz Hosaka, won best in show.Mrs. Clark’s activities extended beyond Westminster. Until recently, she spent most weekends traveling around the country judging at specialty shows. She was a president of the Poodle Club of America and the English Cocker Spaniel Club of America, co-wrote “The International Encyclopedia of Dogs” and published a compilation of her monthly columns for Dogs in Review magazine called “Annie on Dogs!”Mrs. Clark, whose husband died in 1991, had no children and leaves no survivors. She did hope to leave a legacy in the world of registered purebreds.“I have to get through to you that I adore to judge,” she was quoted as saying in The Wall Street Journal earlier this year. “I look forward to walking in the ring. I feel when a class comes in, it’s like a blank canvas, and if I’m lucky, I can paint on this canvas what the breed should be.”'"
"'06-12-23,'0','The musical problems start shortly after Mr. Domingo appears, in the regalia of the emperor, and calls for the people to desist in their savage cries. He now controls the most feared army in the land and is bent on wiping out cultural differences in the conquered regions of China. What his nation needs is a stirring musical anthem to foster unity, he explains, in the opera’s first flight into lyricism.But Mr. Tan’s approach to operatic lyricism and vocal writing seems ill-conceived. In preparing this work, he drew on his studies of ancient Chinese folk music, filtering those styles through techniques learned by attending almost every opera the Met produced during his years in New York, starting with his days as a graduate student and a fledgling professional musician. He wanted “The First Emperor” to sing, like the Italian operas he and countless other buffs adore.His music does sing. And sing. And sing. On and on. Whatever the mood of the moment, whether dreamy, defiant, sensual or tragic, as soon as the characters break into song, the melodic lines are inevitably long, arching and slow. Even when the orchestra bustles with intensity, the often cloying vocal lines hovering above still move with almost unvarying deliberateness. In the Italian operas Mr. Tan has in mind — say, Puccini’s “Turandot” — the pacing of vocal lines accords with the impetuosity of the moment and the flow of the words. Mr. Tan’s goal in this work, it would seem, was to create a ritualistic and hypnotic lyricism. But “The First Emperor” gives soaring melody a bad name.Also, because Mr. Tan integrates Chinese melodic elements into the music, the vocal lines continually move by wide and sometimes awkward leaps to unusual notes, making the phrases tiring for the singers. There is undeniable artistry at work in all this. Playing through these passages on the piano (from the piano-vocal score), I found some of Mr. Tan’s exotic harmonies and elusive vocal lines enticing. But a little of this goes a long way.Between the scenes of ruminative lyricism come orchestral passages that are much more inventive and effective. Take, for example, the crucial third scene of Act I. Emperor Qin has implored Gao Jianli, his estranged childhood friend and a gifted musician, to compose the unifying anthem. But Gao Jianli, whose mother was killed when his homeland was conquered by the emperor, is full of bitterness and resists. Princess Yueyang, the emperor’s willful and alluring daughter, has fallen for Gao Jianli, even though she is pledged to the emperor’s right arm, General Wang. In this scene, the princess slowly seduces Gao Jianli, who cannot resist her.And slowly is the operative word. The expansive lyricism begins enticingly but soon turns saccharine and, worse, inert. Yet when the singers depart, the orchestra, vividly enriched with Chinese instruments, takes up their themes and processes them through thick, spiky, grippingly astringent harmonies. Would that there were more such moments in the opera. The choral ensembles are also powerful and harmonically bracing, including the crucial final anthem, in which Gao Jianli, defying the emperor, recycles a mournful slave song. The more “The First Emperor” sounds like “Crouching Tiger” the better; the more it sounds like updated “Turandot,” the more tedious it becomes.The Met has spared no expense in mounting this $2 million co-production with the Los Angeles Opera. The set by Fan Yue is dominated by stairs through which you can sometimes glimpse colored banners and assembled masses. Descending from ropes above the stage is an intricate network of stones, representing both the writing tablets on which the emperor codified the Chinese language and the blocks of the Great Wall, with which his name is associated. Emi Wada has created 400 wildly colored costumes.You have to admire the cast members for their willingness to grapple with this unconventional new work, though the demands of the wide-ranging vocal lines were evident in some tired-sounding singing. As Gao Jianli, the tenor Paul Groves summoned ardor and energy. The agile coloratura soprano Elizabeth Futral made a kittenish and sensual Princess Yueyang. The charismatic mezzo-soprano Michelle DeYoung was mostly wasted as the long-fingered, ominous Shaman, a rather campy role. The mezzo-soprano Susanne Mentzer brought dignity to the smaller role of the princess’s mother, and the sturdy bass Hao Jiang Tian was a stern General Wang.And give credit to Mr. Domingo, who at nearly 66 is still ambitious, still taking chances and challenging himself. He mostly sang with stamina and burnished power. True, his best friend onstage often seemed to be the experienced prompter, Donna Racik, invisible to the audience but quite often the focus of Mr. Domingo’s attention. And though the role was written for him, he could not disguise the effort involved in singing it. Despite his trouble with top notes in recent years, Mr. Domingo’s voice sounded freshest when the lines took him into his still clarion upper range. The man takes on too much. But what a major artist!With one intermission, the opera lasted just 3 hours 20 minutes yet seemed much longer. In the final scene, the emperor’s inauguration — after his daughter has taken her own life (in what may be the longest farewell aria in opera, which is saying something), and after his general has been poisoned by Gao Jianli, who then mutilates himself by biting off his own tongue to spite the emperor — Mr. Domingo breaks one final time into lofty flights of ponderously arching lyricism.

"'06-12-23,'0','Of the two artists, Rubens clearly stands taller today. But when they first joined forces to paint “The Battle of the Amazons” (1598-1600), Rubens was very much a newcomer to Antwerp, while Brueghel — nine years his senior and heir to the name and fame of his father, Pieter Bruegel the Elder — was already well established.Then, in 1600, Rubens began a long sojourn in Italy, which would transform his art and his reputation. When he returned to Antwerp nine years later, he was appointed court painter to Albert and Isabella, the Spanish regents of the Southern Netherlands, and he soon set up a workshop with an ever-growing legion of young artists as his assistants.By all accounts, this is when Rubens’s earlier acquaintance with Brueghel blossomed into a close friendship. Rubens became godfather to two of Brueghel’s children. He also wrote letters in Italian on behalf of his colleague to Brueghel’s patron, Cardinal Federico Borromeo of Milan; for this favor, Brueghel jokingly referred to him as “my secretary.”A surfeit of commissions may have smoothed away any sharp edges of rivalry: both painters had more work than they could handle. So, while their studios were kept busy, they apparently viewed collaboration — with each other and with other artists — as the best way to increase their productivity.Further, such was their renown that works carrying joint attribution assumed an inflated value: each painter was, after all, the unchallenged Flemish master in his own genre. They were also hard workers, in Rubens’s case even finding time for politics and diplomacy too.It is not known whether they worked in each other’s studios or whether unfinished canvases were carried in frames between their nearby workshops. A logical division of labor was nonetheless established in “The Battle of the Amazons,” where Rubens painted the teeming figures in the lower half of the oil and Brueghel composed the landscapes and skies stretching above them.Researchers have also been able to distinguish Rubens’s thick brushstrokes from Brueghel’s more delicate, even intimate, style. And from this observation, along with underdrawings detected through X-rays, they have concluded that in most cases Brueghel designed the painting and may even have suggested its theme.This was apparently true of “The Return From War: Mars Disarmed by Venus,” an oil painted in 1610-12, which the Getty Museum bought in 2000.In this case Brueghel created the staging for Rubens’s sensual figures: he painted a long ruined vault with a forge, an artillery piece and cast-off armor before Rubens introduced the naked Venus, her warrior hero and several Cupids. Interestingly, researchers have found that Rubens painted over some of Brueghel’s work — which Brueghel then restored.“All in all, it would appear that collaboration between the two painters in this early stage was not yet entirely streamlined,” notes a pamphlet accompanying this show.A few years later, in “The Garden of Eden With the Fall of Man,” the artists worked in total harmony. This is also the only work that carries both their names: “PETRI PAVLI RVBENS FIGR” at the lower left and “IBRVEGHEL FEC” at the lower right. These inscriptions in turn confirm that Rubens painted the figures (“FIGR”), while Brueghel “made” (“FEC”) the work.Examination of the oil indicates that Rubens painted Adam and Eve along with a brown horse and the Garden of Eden’s infamous snake, while Brueghel created what was known as a “landscape paradise” of animals at rest and play. One result is that while the naked Adam and Eve provide narrative, the eye is constantly drawn to Brueghel’s exquisite menagerie.A similar tension between people and place is apparent in their “Pan and Syrinx” and, even more, in their “Flora and Zephyr,” where Brueghel’s wild flowers are arranged as if posing for a still life. In contrast, in their “Vision of Saint Hubert,” Brueghel’s proud stag stands at stage center; a light and a crucifix appearing between its antlers prompt Hubert’s conversion.The best-known collaboration between these artists, however, is their portrayal of the Five Senses, and the Prado Museum in Madrid, which owns the five oils, has lent “Allegory of Taste” to this show. Thought to be a homage to princely wealth, this painting depicts a palace and gardens in the background, while hunted animals and old paintings (including a reproduction of one by Brueghel) surround a table where Taste, in the form of a woman, is poured wine by a satyr.The case is made that no documentary record of the Rubens-Brueghel partnership exists because it was considered totally normal at the time. Indeed, this show also includes works by Brueghel and Rubens’s workshop, as well as two striking mythological paintings — “The Head of Medusa” and “Prometheus Bound” — by Rubens and Frans Snyders.Certainly, work never disrupted the friendship between Rubens and Brueghel. When Brueghel died, Rubens became the executor of his will as well as guardian to his younger children. And when Brueghel’s oldest son, Jan Brueghel the Younger, took over his father’s studio, he also worked with Rubens. Among 17th-century Flemish artists, it seems, two was never a crowd.'"
"'06-12-23,'0','Auburn University Professor Thomas Petee, who had been the focus of an investigation into academic irregularities involving athletes in the school’s sociology department, has been suspended with pay by the school because of a different academic matter.An Auburn spokeswoman, Deedie Dowdle, confirmed yesterday that Petee’s suspension came amid an investigation into grade changes in the sociology department that were recently revealed by an internal audit.The university’s director of public affairs, Brian Keeter, said Petee would be suspended “pending a due process hearing.” According to the university handbook, the expected next step for Petee would be going before a dismissal review board, which would include five of his peers. Keeter would not answer specific questions about the reasons for Petee’s suspension, saying the university did not comment on personnel matters.The New York Times reported on Dec. 10 that a student-athlete’s grade of “incomplete” was changed to an “A” without the consent of Professor Paul Starr, who taught the class. Starr said he never met or taught the athlete, but the grade change in his class allowed the athlete to graduate, putting the athlete over the school’s minimum 2.0 mark for graduation.Petee’s suspension came five months after he was forced to resign as a department head after a New York Times investigation revealed that he had taught an inordinate amount of directed readings, classes similar to independent study. He taught more than 150 in one semester alone and issued disproportionately high grades to at-risk athletes in the classes.In the wake of the findings, the university also overhauled its directed readings program.The report Auburn produced in its first investigation of Petee showed that he had given 55 grade changes between January 2003 and the spring of 2006, more than double the number of the average faculty member in his department. The report did not break down the percentage of those students who were athletes, unlike the data in the rest of the report.'"

"'06-12-24,'0','“Nobody has decided anything yet and they have not made a formal recommendation,” the official continued. “They are open to the idea of such an option and are weighing how best to execute it and what the traffic will bear with the Iraqis.”The possible increase in troops, officials said, ranges from fewer than 10,000 to as many as 30,000.Politically, winning the support of American generals for the additional troops is crucial to Mr. Bush if he hopes to make the increase part of the new strategy he is expected to announce in early January.Over the past two weeks, Mr. Bush has appeared at odds with the generals in some of his comments, as the White House veered toward strategies that involve a greater show of force and some members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff questioned whether a “surge” in forces would make a lasting difference.The Camp David meeting convened by President Bush included Mr. Gates, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and the national security adviser, Stephen J. Hadley, for what the White House called a chance for Mr. Gates, who took office this week, to report on his findings. Mr. Bush plans to convene a full meeting of the National Security Council on Thursday at his ranch in Crawford, Tex.The key to any new strategy, some officials said, would be a binding commitment by the Iraqi government that it would provide far more troops as well, and take other steps to try to slow the sectarian violence. The government of Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki has repeatedly stressed the desire to take charge of the security situation in Baghdad, but failed to send most of the reinforcements the Americans requested this summer during a beefed-up effort to quell the violence.It is unclear how Mr. Bush plans to enforce any commitments from Mr. Maliki, but Mr. Gates said in Baghdad before flying home that he sensed “a broad strategic agreement between the Iraqi military and Iraqi government and our military.”“There is still some work to be done,” he said. “But I do expect to give a report to the president on what I’ve learned and my perceptions.” Mr. Gates was joined on his Iraq tour by officials from the White House and other parts of the government.Administration officials, who spoke anonymously because they were not authorized to publicly discuss internal deliberations, said that General Casey had not yet submitted a formal recommendation to Mr. Gates and Mr. Bush. Mr. Gates, they said, asked General Casey to enter into final discussions with Iraqi officials on the specifics of their role.But officials said General Casey was coming closer to the position of General Odierno that a greater a show of force would be critical to the effort to contain the Sunni insurgency and tamp down the violence by Shiite militias. The shift in the general’s position was first reported in The Los Angeles Times on Saturday.General Casey has long argued that the principal emphasis of American policy should be on training Iraqi security forces, and handing over responsibility to the Iraqi military and police. In a plan General Casey presented in Washington in June, he anticipated reducing some American combat troops in September. But his plan was shelved after the surge in violence in Iraq.As the sectarian killings escalated, the White House began to explore the option of sending more troops as a broader strategy to secure Baghdad. The idea was raised in a November memo prepared by Mr. Hadley. Mr. Bush discussed the option during a recent meeting with the Joint Chiefs of Staff that was organized as part of the administration’s Iraq strategy review.Some generals appeared notably unenthusiastic. Some members of the Joint Chiefs appeared worried about the strain it would place on the Army and the Marines. Gen. John P. Abizaid, the top American commander for the Middle East, told Congress last month that adding 20,000 troops would improve security, but argued that the effect would only be temporary because the United States military was not large enough to sustain such an increase indefinitely.As for General Casey, he suggested Wednesday that he was neither the originator of the idea nor actively lobbying for it. At the same time, he indicated that he was not adamantly opposed to it. “Additional troops have to be for a purpose,” the general said. “I’m not necessarily opposed to the idea, but what I want to see happen is, if we do bring more American troops here, they help us progress toward our strategic objectives.”Should Mr. Bush decide to send more troops, General Casey’s backing for a such a step would help the president deal with Congressional critics, who have pressed the administration to begin a withdrawal. It would also aid him with Republicans, some of whom were taken aback this week when Colin L. Powell, the former secretary of state who also served as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said Mr. Bush had not yet clearly defined a role for additional troops that made it worth the projected casualties and deeper American involvement.Mr. Gates said during the trip that he did not believe that Iraqi leaders were deeply split on the question of an increase in the American presence. Mr. Maliki proposed a plan to Mr. Bush in their meeting last month in Amman, Jordan, under which the Iraqis would assume direct command of its 10 Army divisions and a National Police division by June.The Iraqi prime minister also proposed that his government assume the primary responsibility for security in Baghdad over the next several months while most American forces would move to the periphery of the city. The idea of moving American troops to the capital’s outskirts is consistent with General Casey’s long-term plan, but the Iraqi time frame is far more compressed. Some of Mr. Bush’s aides have expressed concern that the Iraqis’ desire for control outstrips their capacity.However, as a political matter, officials said, it is crucial that Mr. Bush be able to announce that any increase in American troops will be made in parallel with a similar commitment by the Iraqis, and that the eventual goal of the strategy is to put the Iraqis in the lead. The Iraqis promised to send two brigades of Iraqi Army troops this summer, but most of the troops never arrived.Lt. Gen. Martin Dempsey, who oversees the training of Iraq’s security forces, said this week that he was overhauling his training efforts so that Iraqi Army units would be easier to deploy, including providing more pay.“We’ve got two or three brigade headquarters and six additional battalions that are scheduled now over the next couple of months to come to Baghdad,” he said. An Iraqi battalion nominally has more than 700 soldiers, but the actual number is often far less, since many soldiers are on scheduled leaves or absent without leave.'"
"'06-12-24,'0','Knight and Smith spoke a few days ago and reminisced about when Smith passed Adolph Rupp for the top spot in 1997. Their vastly different styles were once summed up by Michael Jordan, who played for Smith at North Carolina and for Knight on the 1984 United States Olympic team.“He said that both Dean and I have always tried to reach the same end, and that we have different ways of doing it,” Knight said. “Coach Smith is the master of the four-corner offense and Coach Knight is master of the four-letter word. That’s a verbatim quote from Jordan.”In his 41st year of coaching, Knight has a career record of 879-353. Smith went 879-254 in 36 years, all at North Carolina. Knight and Smith are also the only men to have won national championships as players and coaches. They also share the record for coaching in the most N.C.A.A. tournaments (27).Pat Summitt, the Tennessee women’s coach, is the overall leader in major-college victories with 924 as of yesterday.Playing before 11,561 fans, the second-biggest crowd ever at the campus arena, Tech led for all but a couple of possessions in the opening minutes.Bucknell (5-6) pulled to 42-39 early in the second half, but missed 13 consecutive shots starting with a 3-pointer that could have tied the score.

"'06-12-24,'0','Before heading off for the Christmas holiday, many investors placed sell orders, pulling the stock market down for its worst week since the summer.Gloomy economic reports contributed to decidedly unfestive stock returns among traders who stayed at their desks: volume on the New York Stock Exchange on Friday was the lowest of the year. On Friday, the government said that durable goods orders, excluding transportation equipment, fell 1.1 percent. On Thursday, a Federal Reserve survey found that manufacturing in the Philadelphia area had declined last month. Concerns about the possibility of economic weakness in 2007 also helped to send stocks downward.Alcoa, the aluminum company, lost 5.8 percent, the worst weekly performance in the Dow Jones industrial average.For the week, the Dow fell 102.30 points, or 0.8 percent, to close at 12,343.22.

"'06-12-24,'0','Of course, that doesn’t mean investors should ignore a stock that pays a good yield. If investment income is important to you — and you plan to hold some equities in your portfolio — strategists recommend looking for large-cap stocks that still pay decent dividends and have a good track record of raising them over time.“We are pretty bullish on companies whose stocks can provide a nice income return, but also some earnings growth,” said Henry H. McVey, the chief investment strategist at Morgan Stanley.For now, Mr. McVey said, a good dividend yield is at least 3 percent, which is well above the average yield of 1.8 percent for the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock indexOf course, that’s still much less than the interest now paid on many bonds or bank deposits. Mr. McVey said that many American companies could afford to pay more dividends and might do so in the future. The companies in the S.& P. 500 now pay 29 percent of their profits to shareholders in the form of dividends, on average — a figure that Mr. McVey said was historically low. Since 1984, the average dividend payout ratio for the index has been 39 percent.But he said that as more baby boomers retired, many would demand higher dividends. Among the stocks that are typically popular with dividend-hungry investors, many have yields that are low by past standards. In particular, the shares of many unregulated utility companies and real estate investment trusts, or REITs, have risen so sharply this year that their yields have plummeted to little more than 2 percent.To be sure, REITs have trounced the rest of the stock market this year. Mutual funds that invest in real estate — which primarily own REITs — have been the best domestic fund category, with average gains of 31.5 percent through Thursday, according to Morningstar. By law, REITs must pay most of their income to investors as dividends, but the steep climb in their share prices has driven down their yields. Mr. Schweitzer cautioned REIT investors not to expect the huge capital gains of recent years to continue. But he said he wasn’t bearish on their share prices either, because he didn’t think the commercial real estate that most REITs own — like office buildings and hotels — had become as expensive as residential real estate has.Although utilities funds have also had great returns this year — an average of 25.5 percent through Thursday — a few large, well-known utility stocks still have high yields. Verizon, the telecommunications company based in New York, has a yield of 4.4 percent, while Con Edison — an old-school, regulated power company also in New York — yields 4.8 percent.Sam Stovall, the chief investment strategist at S.& P., says he likes financial stocks now, partly because many still have good yields. “A lot of companies within the financial sector have S.& P. quality rankings of A-minus or higher,” he said, “and above-average consistency in raising earnings and dividends.”Although their yields are typically not as high as those of the best-yielding utilities or telecommunications stocks, shares of J.P. Morgan Chase are yielding 2.8 percent now, while those of Citigroup are yielding 3.6 percent. Mr. Bernstein of Merrill has two more bits of advice for American investors who want to bolster the yield of their portfolios: shop for dividends abroad, and bulk up on high-grade bonds at home.Although the dollar has fallen 9.8 percent against the euro this year, Mr. Bernstein said the dollar could slide further in 2007. If it does, he said, Americans can benefit from owning foreign stocks that pay good dividends. “People always talk about diversification by geography, but they’re thinking of capital gains. They never think about diversification in terms of income,” he said. “But if you’re bearish on the dollar, why wouldn’t you want your dividends in Swiss francs?”By and large, Mr. Bernstein said, Americans can hunt for good dividend-paying European stocks in the same corners of the market where they would look at home — utilities, telecommunications and consumer staples. He said investors who preferred mutual funds could look for a global equity and income fund that owns a hefty stake of European dividend-paying stocks, or a European-focused fund with a good yield.If you want to bolster interest income on the fixed-income side of your portfolio, Mr. Bernstein strongly advises against riskier issues. The value of high-yield bonds and emerging-market debt has risen so much in recent years, he said, that investors simply aren’t being compensated for the extra risk.Mr. Bernstein now favors corporate bonds rated triple-A. While global financial markets now have few scarcities, he said, the market share of triple-A bonds in the global bond markets has shrunk to half its level of less than a decade ago. Triple-A bonds now make up a little more than 8 percent of the global bond markets, down from 15 percent in 1998.“There’s been such a flood of other issuance from emerging markets and high-yield,” Mr. Bernstein said. He predicted that this could create a shortage of the highest-rated corporate debt, especially if the spread between high-grade and high-yield bonds — which has become razor-thin in recent years — were to widen.FINALLY, Mr. Bernstein cautioned investors not to wait until they were facing retirement to focus on investment income — and to remember the lifelong benefits of compounding dividends and interest.He pointed to the technology-heavy Nasdaq composite, and its performance against utilities stocks, which traditionally pay big dividends. The Nasdaq returned 11.1 percent a year, on average, from its creation in February 1971 through November this year. The S.& P. utilities index, meanwhile, had average annual returns of 11.4 percent.“Classic mom-and-pop utilities beat tech stocks, because of the power of compounding dividends,” Mr. Bernstein said. “The tortoise beat the hare.”'"

Echoing the prayer of all his brethren, one media executive — who chimed in on condition that he not be named — suggested that this would be the year of equalization: that media companies would figure out ways to make money from new digital distribution formats and the Internet without cannibalizing their existing businesses. In other words, hallelujah, they will finally make up on volume what they are losing on price.Many media businesses — particularly AOL — reoriented themselves this year to grab a share of the growing online advertising honey pot. This led James Bedell of Queens to wonder whether we’ll see everyone run back to the other side of the room next year in pursuit of subscription dollars. “Banner ads are nice, membership fees are nicer,” Mr. Bedell wrote. “Look for the information superhighway to pick up a lot more tolls.”Tony Trippe, an associate professor at the Rochester Institute of Technology, predicted a year of consolidation.“We’re going to see organizations learn that their business model is not the end-all and be-all,” he wrote. “These organizations will try to salvage what they can from their pipe dreams, and that will lead to the buyouts, mergers and consolidations.”A similar less-cheery view — if you’re a media executive — came from Fred Bothwell of Georgetown, Tex., who predicted the “continuing diminished significance of profit-based mainstream media as information sources.” They will wither, he predicted, as more people turn to Web-based purpose-driven services like Craigslist that are not looking to maximize profits, but to make the world a smiley place.There were a few votes for Google to continue its rise and to extend its tentacles successfully into other forms of media, particularly video. That said, a couple of readers predicted that the Google juggernaut would run out of steam, possibly at the hands of a resurgent Yahoo.Interesting days lie ahead for the studios. Doomsday forecasts of declining movie attendance went away when the figures reversed slightly this year, but it will be interesting to see what happens if a studio (Walt Disney, anyone?) becomes the first to simultaneously release a major film on pay-per-view and at the multiplex.Richard Greenfield, an analyst at Pali Capital, issued a report last week arguing that 2007 would be the first year since the introduction of the DVD roughly a decade ago that consumer spending on the discs will decline, putting pressure on studios that rely heavily on them.One reader predicted that with the bonanza in DVD growth ending, and big media companies desperate for a new growth engine, 2007 would be the year when “traditional media make a big bet on online gaming: they will buy up, invest in or launch massively multiplayer online gaming companies.”Luke Luckett, a recent graduate of New York University, predicted that the digital divide between those who have ready access to broadband Internet and those who don’t would become more pronounced next year.For the haves, the Web could become a much more useful and vibrant place as Web and media companies start stitching together their various services to provide versatile and detailed local information. Those services include maps, listings, reviews, advertising, news, traffic reports and all kinds of content from users, like the growing practice of “tagging,” the online equivalent of Post-it notes.IN the column two weeks ago about “the year that wasn’t,” the inclusion of high-definition television attracted a chorus of viewers who, having their own personal Howard Beale moments, aren’t going to take it any more when it comes to their television viewing.Betty Morgan of Sumter, S.C., echoed a dozen others when she wrote: “Why would I want to pay more for the same crummy TV programs? I use it to watch my old DVDs while I wait for them to kill one of the new formats. There are too many things to fix before the year of digital happens.”As Rein Taul of Toronto put it: “I for one am sick and tired of hearing about the red herrings of piracy, lost ad revenue, new technology impacts, etc. The American auto industry is paying the piper for their lack of respect for their customers as manifest through poor product. How far behind can the entertainment industry be?”Although such views are subjective by their very nature, it is worth noting that people still care passionately about professionally produced media in this do-it-yourself world of exploding choice and control.'"
"'06-12-24,'0','Mr. Perrett, a native of Michigan whose family owned hotels there, has completed five rehabilitations of historic buildings into hotels, including the conversion of a Romanesque-style bank building in San Diego into a Courtyard by Marriott and the conversion of the Fulton Building in Pittsburgh into one of the most popular hotels in the Renaissance line.The resurrection of the Providence building has mirrored the gradual transformation of the city, whose economy had changed after the exodus of manufacturers after World War I.The building’s conversion, though, has been a complicated one.“The weird thing is, the building really never had a history,” said Edward F. Sanderson, a historian and executive director of the Rhode Island Historical Preservation and Heritage Commission.Construction began in 1926. But about two years later, “the Masons ran out of money, and they told the workers to quit work for the day, and somehow word got around that they shouldn’t come back,” Mr. Sanderson explained. “When I first came to work in the 1970s, you could go in there, and you could see the hand tools that were still sitting where they had been put down in 1928,” he said. “It was pretty amazing.”The building’s unfinished eight-story interior remained a large hull with rusted steel-platform staircases gripping its graffiti-covered walls.“The copper roof had been stolen in the 1970s — an entire copper roof — and the inside was rotted,” Mr. Perrett said.The temple had been part of a complex that included a narrow structure linking it to a large theater building. The state bought the entire complex in 1945 and finished the theater building, converting it into the popular Veterans Memorial Auditorium, according to Mr. Sanderson. The auditorium is used primarily as a symphony space.Despite the temple’s optimistic cornerstone, which is carved with a “1949” date, the state did nothing with the building.There it sat on a slope just below the Statehouse, Mr. Sanderson noted, “too big and too expensive to fix, and too big and too expensive to tear down, deteriorating outside the governor’s window.”“The idea that a building would stand empty and unused for 75 years in the center of a city is pretty extraordinary,” he said.The restoration project was extensive — and unusual. A $2 million metal brace was built to hold up three walls of the temple while developers tore down and rebuilt the interiors. A fourth wall was destroyed many years ago, along with the building linking it to the theater.To take advantage of a ballroom originally built by the Masons below what is now the Veterans Memorial Auditorium, developers excavated two stories below the temple to create an underground passage between the two structures. The narrow linking building was rebuilt, and the ballroom was reconstructed to make it soundproof, ensuring that the strains of a Beethoven fugue would never meld with the driving rhythms of “Hava Nagila” at a wedding in the hotel ballroom, and vice versa, Mr. Perrett said.For Renaissance, a brand under the Marriott International umbrella, the project offered the perfect opportunity to extend the brand, which appeals to business travelers who like to explore the cities they visit, said Rita Cuddihy, the senior vice president of Renaissance. The brand has about nine hotels in rehabilitated historic buildings throughout the country, with three more, including the Renaissance Providence, about to open.“A historic redo is the perfect way to give local authenticity,” Ms. Cuddihy said.Conversions of historic buildings — whether banks or department stores or Masonic temples — have become increasingly commonplace, according to John M. Tess, the president of the Heritage Consulting Group, which has worked on several hotel conversions over the last 25 years. Besides offering tax credits, the projects are also appealing because they enable developers to redevelop historic buildings exceeding the size allowed by existing zoning regulations, he said.Mr. Tess says he has seen an increase in hotel projects involving historic buildings over the last decade as more people have moved into the downtown areas of American cities.“A lot of hotel chains will consider historic rehabilitations,” Mr. Tess said. “With respect to historic hotels, they can act as almost a flagship. Every town has a hotel or historic building that everyone in town knows about.”The city of Providence, meanwhile, is also considering converting a portion of another historic structure into a hotel: the South Street Station complex, a former electrical power generating plant on the Providence River.Mr. Tess said that these types of projects, made feasible by state and federal tax credits, are limited only by the supply of buildings.“Back in the 1980s and early 1990s, you could go in and buy these buildings at reasonable cost,” he said.“That’s no longer true today, which is why it’s important to have in place government incentives that allow historic buildings to be saved and play an important part in the activities of cities.”'"

But the New Jersey Supreme Court this month ruled that eminent domain can also be used to spare a parcel of rapidly-disappearing countryside from a builder’s imminent plans to pave it over.The 6-1 decision, which allows the South Jersey suburb of Mount Laurel to seize one of its last remaining parcels of farmland, is a significant victory in the vital effort to prevent once rural parts of the Garden State from being overwhelmed with housing developments and strip malls. The 16-acre tract in question had already been prepped by the builder for 23 homes in the $400,000 and up price range.In rescuing the land, the court wrote that the state’s residents “have expressed a strong and sustained public interest” in acquiring open space and “have voted repeatedly” to spend taxpayer money to do so. We agree, and would add that in a congested state like New Jersey preservation of the few remaining pieces of open land is as much in the public interest as any highway or government building.The lawyer for the developer says he expects to appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court on grounds that the decision violates federal fair housing laws since the town is trying to stop residential development, rather than just preserve open space. The lawyer also said the ruling amounts to a “death knell” for developers and would have a “chilling effect” on new construction. But a simple glance at the proliferation of housing developments, corporate headquarters and big box stores in once rural parts of the state makes it hard to believe that there is much of a threat to additional development.By stipulating that municipalities must pay a fair market price that reflects the land’s development and zoning approvals, the Supreme Court imposed a safeguard against any town that might otherwise use its new power cavalierly. Michele Byers, executive director of the New Jersey Conservation Foundation, said that even stronger deterrents are the high cost of going through the eminent domain process itself and the political unpopularity of invoking eminent domain for anything except as a last resort.Interestingly, Mount Laurel, about 20 miles from Philadelphia, was the site of a series of earlier state Supreme Court decisions beginning in 1975 that became the basis for additional housing. The rulings, which became models for several states across the country, ultimately required many of New Jersey’s wealthy towns to provide for modest amounts of affordable housing, especially when they gave the go ahead for new expensive homes.Today, Mount Laurel is typical of many once sparsely-populated New Jersey towns that find themselves almost completely developed. The mayor, Peter McCaffrey, said the township instituted eminent domain proceedings as the only available way to save one of its two remaining tracts of farmland. He said the town of 43,000, which is home to three retirement communities, 22 hotels and numerous businesses and single family residences, is now about 90 percent developed.'"
"'06-12-24,'0','BUILDING affordable housing in New York has always been a challenge; rarely, if ever, has it been achieved without government subsidies. But with a new mixed-income condominium building going up in Clinton Hill in Brooklyn, that might be about to change.The Pratt Area Community Council, a nonprofit affordable-housing organization, bought a dilapidated Washington Avenue building from the city with the intention of renovating it into rental apartments, but it turned out to be beyond repair. The city declined to offer any subsidies for a new building, and the council had never done market-rate development before.So council members sought help from the developer Mark Alexander, who had worked in the affordable-housing market for the better part of 25 years before founding Urban Builders Collaborative, a for-profit company.The council and Mr. Alexander became partners in a joint venture to construct a mixed-income condo building, the DeWitt, now being built at 483 Washington Avenue. It is to have 16 one- and two-bedroom units, with eight being sold at market rate in order to subsidize the other eight — to be sold through a council-administered lottery system to households earning less than $88,625 for a family of four.Mr. Alexander said that while most nonprofit affordable-housing developers tend to do cookie-cutter buildings, to keep costs to a minimum, he sought to produce affordable units that were also well designed.To that end, he hired the architects Curtis & Ginsberg to design a building to befit its charming Clinton Hill neighborhood while also using newer finishes and modern technology.'"
"'06-12-24,'0','When federal investigators looked into manipulated stock-option grants this year, what emerged was a scandal entangling at least 120 companies, from Apple to the UnitedHealth Group. Next came a small glossary of new terms, so those without accounting or law degrees could wrap their brains around the concepts.There was “backdating,” which is retroactively setting a stock option’s grant price to a date when the stock price was lower, to “bake in” a profit. This led to dozens of financial restatements and abrupt departures of officials — including one chief executive, Jacob Alexander of Comverse Technologies, who fled to Namibia to escape fraud charges.There was also “bullet-dodging,” or delaying an options grant until just after the release of bad news to take advantage of an expected lower price. The practice is so hard to prosecute that many lawyers consider it bulletproof.And then there was something known as “spring-loading,” or awarding stock options ahead of positive news to reap an instant paper profit. Even the Securities and Exchange Commission seemed divided on this one. One commissioner called it smart business, suggesting it was a legal way for companies to get a bigger bang for each stock grant. Others called it flat-out securities fraud, raising the issue of insider trading.Federal regulators have yet to bring a spring-loading case, though a company called Cyberonics has drawn attention for making a large option grant to its chief executive just hours after a regulatory panel recommended approval of its implant to treat depression. Such a case could help reshape laws molded from a 40-year-old case involving a Texas oil company that awarded options before a big discovery.Officials have had fun with the wacky legal lexicon. “Spring-loading sounds like the type of thing you ask your kids not to do inside the house,” said Christopher Cox, the S.E.C. chairman. And “backdating sounds like something that you wouldn’t want your daughter to do anywhere.”'"

Walking and breathing problems limit the distance she can manage on her feet.The Long Island Rail Road is not an option for her because she could not make the walk from the platform in the bowels of Penn Station to the street.Our visits are possible because I drop her off at the venue entrance or at a nearby restaurant before parking the car, and then I pick her up at the end of the activity.Without this arrangement, she might find it impossible to continue visiting. This would be both sad and unjust. There is more than one kind of penalty.The residents of Rowayton concerned about increasing through truck traffic in their area (“Sounding an Alarm After an Idyll Is Broken,” by Joseph Berger, column, Dec. 3) are merely confronted with a single, and relatively minor, symptom of a systemic problem for Connecticut.Simply put, mobility is in crisis on the I-95 corridor. Getting from place to place has become an exercise in unpredictability, danger and frustration. The lack of capacity on the state’s highways has forced traffic onto arterial streets.I am quite confident that truck drivers don’t wish to traverse those streets any more than the local residents want them there. If the residents of Rowayton wish to keep their local streets safe and speedy, then they should push to add capacity to the state’s highways.It is obvious to anyone who traverses southern Connecticut that I-95 and the Merritt Parkway are no longer adequate to handle the traffic that they are forced to carry.When Power Goes Out, A Backup for the FishRe “In the Dark, and on Our Own,” by Akiko Busch (Home Work, Dec. 17): After enduring countless power outages, and with much debate, we finally caved in last year and put in a heavy-duty outdoor generator.My husband couldn’t stand the thought of his saltwater fish gasping for air as they had when the tank turned off during previous blackouts. Hooking up the refrigerator and freezer was truly an afterthought.The first time we lost power after the generator was installed, its loud hum when we switched it on was indeed music to our ears. But the second time? A 50-foot maple came crashing down and landed right on the generator. No hum for us.Fortunately, the company that installed it was able to get it up and working in two days, so we had use of it for the remaining three days we were without power.And the fish? They were fine.From Age 2 to 20, My Schedule Is Full!Re “But When Is There Time to Be a Kid?,” by Michael Winerip (Parenting, Dec. 10): Our three daughters, a freshman in high school and twins in sixth grade, rarely find time to relax after school during the week — what parents call “down time.”As a stay-at-home mom, I am definitely the champion organizer and controller of “the calendar” in our house, so that everyone makes it on time and where they should be for track, soccer, basketball, religious school and on and on.My husband, a child of the “Wonder Years” ’60s, recalls happily playing Jets versus Packers in the backyard of his family home in Marlboro, N.J. He didn’t play organized sports until high school, but easily made the school teams for track and basketball. Imagine, he didn’t even have a personal trainer!The increase in undergraduate tuition at the University of Connecticut should come as no surprise.Connecticut, with the nation’s highest per capita income ($47,819 in 2005), is tied with Rhode Island as 43rd among the 50 states in per capita expenditures for higher education.The good news? UConn has some terrific polo fields and about 20 polo ponies. After all, where else can some poor kid seeking an education learn to play polo?In “Energy Inefficiency” (Op-Ed, Nov. 26), Rob Sargent and Tony Dutzik joined the chorus blaming deregulation for Connecticut’s electricity woes. They have a point; deregulation has not worked in Connecticut, but not for the reasons they state.The Congressional Budget Office published a report in 2001 titled “Causes and Lessons of the California Electricity Crisis.” One of the key conclusions was that “deregulation itself did not fail; rather, it was never achieved.”The same holds true in Connecticut, and remarkably the state leadership is promoting the same course of action as California. No doubt it will achieve the same result, chaos.The causes of high energy prices lie far beyond Connecticut’s borders. The solution is to use less energy. Truly free markets will go a long way toward solving this challenge.'"
"'06-12-24,'0','Throughout the 18th and 19th centuries, the New York region produced metals like copper, silver, iron and gold from mines in the ground. (Above-ground mines, the most common in the region today, also produced bluestone, feldspar, brownstone, beryl and pegmatite.)Mr. DeGroat’s home is near a warren of former iron mines, which dot the Hudson Highlands along the New Jersey-New York border. Mr. Baker’s property, meanwhile, is on top of an old mine for barite, which was once used as a paint thickener.Even if the mines have been lost to history, the dangers they pose are real, say geologists and mine safety experts. Once all the valuable ore was extracted, they say, miners usually walked away, not properly filling or sealing the shafts. As a result, there is a high risk of collapse, especially because the century-old wood timbers propping up their roofs will eventually rot, the experts say.To make matters worse, they say, few maps survive, so few homebuyers, developers or zoning boards know the mines’ precise locations. And because side tunnels can radiate from the central shaft like branches from a tree, they can affect houses hundreds of yards from the entrance.“People are building homes these days in what they think are pristine wooded areas, not realizing that 100 years ago these were industrial areas,” said William Kelly, the geologist for the State of New York. “There might be a vague recollection about the mines among some locals, but for the most part, they’re forgotten.”Before federal money ran out two years ago, Mr. Kelly was compiling an inventory of all the New York mines, but he never finished. He identified 270 mines, and though most are far from the metropolitan area, he says, they still can be causes for concern.In western New York, between Rochester and Buffalo, former rock salt and gypsum mines carved out of soft rock have the potential to cave in. Already, cave-ins have delayed home construction in Amherst and Oakfield, Mr. Kelly said.Closer to New York City, in Kingston, caverns that measure 2,000 feet from entrance to back wall are left over from limestone excavation in the early 1800s. Though mushroom farmers later took over some of the caverns, developers built homes over others, adding considerable weight to their soft-rock roofs, Mr. Kelly said. Vibrations from cars on roads can also weaken the rock, he said.Collapses are not the only threats that mines present.Arsenic, for example, has also been detected in tailings, or residue, from an iron mine next to Mr. DeGroat’s property in northern New Jersey.The federal Environmental Protection Agency is cleaning up the site, although as part of a separate project, removing paint sludge from a former Ford plant.For its part, New Jersey is making good progress in pinpointing mines, said Karl Muessig, the state’s geologist.Using a global positioning system, Mr. Muessig said, his office has verified the whereabouts of about 440 of the 588 mines mapped out piecemeal over the years, including some long covered over by shopping centers. The idea is to tackle the most densely settled areas first because of the amount of housing developed there, he said.Compared with its neighbors, Connecticut remains a mining hotbed, sixth in the nation in terms of annual rock and mineral output, according to the United States Geological Survey, mostly because of the basalt it generates from above-ground mines.The state also once dug for copper, cobalt, beryl and lead, however, leaving about 600 mine sites, said Margaret Thomas, a geologist with the Connecticut Geological and Natural History Survey, a division of the State Department of Environmental Protection.The number is based on research completed in 1987. Since then, though, development has surged, especially in rural areas, so the research needs to be updated, state geologists say. And the dangers of old mines were never really assessed, they say.“The potential hazards of them have been by and large ignored,” said Gary Robbins, a geology professor at the University of Connecticut, who investigated Mr. Baker’s sinkhole at the governor’s request. “We need to ask, to what extent are these mines contributing contamination?”Of the few he has studied, Mr. Robbins said he had discovered dissolved arsenic in water dripping from abandoned gold mine tunnels in the Cobalt section of East Hampton.Mine shafts can also funnel radon gas, which at certain concentrations, and with long-term exposure, can lead to an increased risk of lung cancer, from the ground into homes. A Connecticut study conducted in the late 1990s at the Old New-Gate Prison in East Granby — a former copper mine, where years later ingenious Yankees locked up British soldiers during the Revolutionary War — found elevated traces of radon in the tunnels.Another risk of abandoned mines, Mr. Robbins said, comes from hazardous materials like gasoline that were dumped in the shafts over the years. “You have this big hole in the ground,” he said, “and it probably seemed like a good place to throw junk.”In the meantime, Mr. DeGroat waits for the $130,000 that the Borough of Ringwood has estimated it will cost to fill the hole in his yard, as well as a second, smaller one, which appeared in late November. Some preliminary work was performed in mid-December.In Connecticut, Mr. Baker, who paid $13,500 from his own pocket in March to fill the hole in his yard with large stones, weighs his legal options. They include, he says, suing the town or the home’s former owners. If they knew that mines were on his land, he says, they could be liable.“There has to be resolution, one way or the other,” Mr. Baker said. “I wouldn’t have bought anywhere near here if I knew.”'"

"'06-12-24,'0','In his review of Neal Gabler’s “Walt Disney: The Triumph of the American Imagination” (Dec. 3), Bruce Handy tells your readers that Walt was “a cold fish.”Cold fish? On Aug. 26, 1951, when I was 17, Walt’s daughter, Diane, who was my age, introduced me to her father at their home. Walt spent the next five hours talking to me alone, then insisted I swim in their pool while he got dressed for a dinner party, so he could introduce me to his wife, Lilly. During our afternoon together, Walt and I had harmonized on “I Want to Be Happy,” which my mother often sang, and which Walt told me was from “No, No, Nanette,” which he took Lilly to see on their first date. And he warmly advised me to “think of the happiest things; it’s the same as having wings.”The following Tuesday, at Walt’s invitation, I went to his studio for the first time, and met the nine key artists who would work for Walt for the rest of his life. I would know them for the rest of their lives, and none of them considered Walt a cold fish. By then, I had adopted “think of the happiest things” as my philosophy of life, but his artists told me that he was just trying out on me a line he was giving to Peter Pan.Gabler quotes me as saying that Mickey Mouse was the “perfect expression of what he symbolizes — survival,” but the fact that Handy finds Mickey “oddly personality-less” tells, I’m afraid, more about our survival than the Mouse. Many people can no longer understand Mickey or Walt. In personality, Mickey, like Walt, was genuine, cheerful, enthusiastic, humble, confident, versatile, adventurous, clever, charismatic and, above all, warm.My cousin, Shamus Culhane, who animated the Seven Dwarfs marching home singing “Heigh-Ho” in “Snow White,” left the Disney Studio because of illness. Shamus later asked Walt for a letter of recommendation for a Guggenheim. Gabler probably read that letter. Shamus didn’t get the Guggenheim, but the recommendation warmed the rest of his life. In fact, when I read Walt’s letter aloud at my cousin’s 80th birthday party, Shamus wept.The writer teaches the history of animation at New York University, the Fashion Institute of Technology and the Roy Disney School of Animation Studies at Mercy College.'"
"'06-12-24,'0','Among other data, R.T.S.S. provided the missing link in offensive statistical measure: ice time. Although the league has made little use of the stat other than to extol the stamina of a few 30-minute-a-game defensemen, several Web sites, most notably hockey-recap.com and hockeyrodent.com, have begun using the data to derive production assessments for scorers, revealing which players crank out the most offense per minute of ice time.At hockey-recap.com, the points-per-minute statistic is called offensive production. The stat is important, said Gary Cohen, the site’s creator and proprietor, “because it gives us a fair statistical analysis of a player as opposed to raw points.”He added: “In other sports, we base the best — batting average, quarterback rating, points per game in basketball — on averages which don’t take into account the number of games played by a player. Production can give analysts an idea as to which players are truly the most effective.”Those analysts include the legions of hockey hobbyists engaged in pools and fantasy leagues.“I get a lot of people telling me that they use the site for their own hockey pools,” Cohen said, “and they distribute the information to the members of their league. I think that ‘production stats’ and ‘shift reports’ telling you who a player is playing with are important for poolies to understand the scoring potential of a given player. If Jason Ward is suddenly playing with Jaromir Jagr, poolies will want to know this and act accordingly, no matter his talent level and past history.”The table shows Pittsburgh forward Sidney Crosby, the N.H.L.’s leading scorer, as by far the most effective on a per-minute basis. Big guns like Jagr, Teemu Selanne and Alexander Ovechkin also rank high on the chart. But it also reveals the effectiveness of other players much farther down the league scoring list.“The leading scorers are generally at the top,” Cohen said, “but those who have missed time due to injury will be able to rank higher since they are not penalized for missing time.”One example is Buffalo’s Maxim Afinogenov. His 38 points placed him only in the top 20 in N.H.L. scoring through Friday’s games. But he averaged about 17 minutes of playing time per game in 29 games: 498 minutes 19 seconds over all, or 13:07 per point. That ranked him as the second most dangerous offensive force in the league when on the ice.Another case is Islanders center Alexei Yashin, whose 31 points ranked him only in the top 50 in the league. But he missed a quarter of his team’s games because of a sprained knee. Although Yashin has endured an enormous amount of criticism from fans in recent years, on a minutes-per-point basis, he is actually one of the most potent scorers in the league this season.Then there is a player like Anaheim’s young right wing Corey Perry. Of the 19 skaters who have played in a substantial number of the Ducks’ games this season, 17 average more ice time than Perry. Yet he is seventh on the team in scoring.Perry is the perfect example of a player rescued from obscurity by the N.H.L.’s relatively new emphasis on statistics, and fans’ devotion to mining those statistics for ever more meaningful information.'"
"'06-12-24,'0','Mr. Cohen is a partisan. He was a co-author of the 1987 book “Manufacturing Matters,” one of the first to sound an alarm as imports began to displace domestic output. But even the National Association of Manufacturers, which is supportive of members like Whirlpool and General Electric who shift production abroad, agrees that sooner or later innovation and production must go hand in hand.Franklin J. Vargo, the association’s vice president for international economic affairs, sounds even more concerned than Mr. Cohen. “If manufacturing production declines in the United States,” he said, “at some point we will go below critical mass and then the center of innovation will shift outside the country and that will really begin a decline in our living standards.”As it is with global warming, the crisis is in the future. Manufacturing output is not likely to fall below critical mass, as Mr. Vargo puts it, in this generation — or perhaps for several generations. The United States is still a powerhouse in manufacturing, and the output of the nation’s factories continues to rise. The problem is that the craving for manufactured goods in this country is rising faster than output, and imports are filling the gap, particularly in crucial industries.Measuring this growing shortfall is imprecise. The government does not do the calculation, and outsiders must put together numbers from more than one federal database to make estimates. Mr. Zandi of Moody’s Economy.com calculates that 20.5 percent of the manufactured goods bought in America last year were imported. That was up from 11.7 percent in 1992 and 20 percent in 2004. Only once since 1992 did the penetration rate slip — by four-tenths of a percentage point in 2001, a recession year.The other big industrial nations — France, Germany, Japan, England, Canada — also find themselves importing more and more of what they consume. In this comparison, the United States is not even high on the list, reflecting its preglobalization starting point in the 1970s as a much more closed economy than the others.But the country-to-country comparisons hide a disturbing trend. Alan Tonelson, a research fellow at the United States Business and Industry Council, argues that in this country, import penetration is rising faster in core industries like machine-tool building than it is in other countries. And these are the industries that are, or should be, centers of innovation and invention.“If you keep some production here, that is O.K.,” Mr. Cohen said. “But a lot of companies are not doing that, or slowly ceasing to do so. It is a complicated mosaic.”Mr. Tonelson’s efforts to document the exodus are part of his job. His organization represents small manufacturers who keep production at home much more than a General Electric or a Whirlpool. They suffer from import penetration more than the multinationals. The Business and Industry Council even favors tariffs as a protective measure — a red flag for many mainstream Democrats and Republicans, who shun any suggestion that they might be protectionist.Still, Mr. Tonelson, using the same data and the same methodology as Mr. Zandi, but delving into individual industries, finds that the United States is importing more than 50 percent — and in some cases close to 90 percent — of the machine tools used in this country, the aircraft engines and engine parts, the parts that go into cars and trucks, the industrial valves, the printed circuits, the optical instruments and lenses, the telephone switching apparatus, the machines that mold plastics, the broadcasting equipment used for radio, television and wireless transmissions. The list goes on.“It is hard to imagine,” Mr. Tonelson said, “how an international economy can remain successful if it jettisons its most technologically advanced components.”HIS alarm is not widely shared. Most economists and policy analysts say America’s growing service sector and powerful financial sector will eventually offset deterioration in manufacturing. In the short run, these optimists count on a falling dollar, particularly vis-à-vis the Chinese yuan, to put a brake on imports by making them more expensive, and to encourage exports by making them less costly in foreign currency. Thus will America gradually reverse its still-ballooning trade deficit.But implicit in this solution is the belief that industries gone, or nearly gone, will come quickly back to life, and that skills given up can be quickly reacquired.“Economists assume that the factors of production respond very quickly,” Mr. Cohen said. “They don’t. If you were a chief executive, would you build an expensive factory here on the strength of a shift in the exchange rate?”'"

Eos (www.eosairlines.com) offers 48 pod suites on a Boeing 757 built for 220 passengers, with a lowest round-trip fare of $3,150.While MAXjet, with six flights a week each way between London and New York, asks passengers to arrive 90 minutes before a flight, and Eos requires a 45-minute check-in on its two daily flights, Silverset, which is starting with one flight a day nearly every day, is promising its passengers a 30-minute check-in process with no checked bags. “We want to be a sanctuary for the busy traveler who wants fast-check in, sleep and a low fare,” says Lawrence Hunt, Silverjet’s chief executive.Silverjet has its own terminal at Luton, and there and at Newark’s Terminal B a “concierge” will meet you, handle your luggage and offer you a drink. The company also plans a mandatory “carbon offset” contribution in its price — an increasingly popular offer in the travel industry — which passengers can direct to one of a number of climate friendly projects.'"
"'06-12-24,'0','Pegu Club The Pegu is like the Barcelona Bar’s sophisticated (and distant) cousin, and the menu is also dominated by concoctions equally creative but infinitely more classy. You’re also unlikely to see N.F.L. games on plasma screens. This dark upstairs lounge — (sort of) hidden on Houston Street — is named for the British Colonial Officers’ Club near the Gulf of Martaban in 19th-century Burma.The menu lists the ingredients, but little good that will do you unless you know the difference between yellow and green Chartreuse — the green was the original liqueur made by Chartreuse monks; it’s stronger and less sweet than the yellow — or you think Punt e Mes is a fourth-down option in the New York Giants playbook (it’s a vermouth). The Black Jack has bonded applejack, blackberries, Benedictine lemon juice, simple syrup and egg whites; the Jamaican Firefly uses house-made ginger beer, dark rum, simple syrup and lime juice. The drinks are never overly sweet, but if you’re worried, try something like the 19th Century: bourbon, Lillet Rouge, crème de cacao and lemon juice.Employees Only A restaurant by day and raucous bar by night, EO (as its sign reads) is in the West Village. You might have to ask for the drinks menu, and you might be discouraged by the amount of beer being passed around, but the seasonal cocktail menu is full of creative stuff. The Ginger Smash mixes gin and apple liqueur with muddled ginger root and cranberries in quantities that challenge, if not defy, most straws. On the other hand, some cocktails may be better left alone: the Mediterra is puréed fig and honey in vodka, sort of an Israeli picnic gone awry.Gin Lane This is another restaurant with plenty of bar space that takes its drinks seriously, much as its atmosphere, redolent of an old-school Fortune 500 boardroom, might lead you to expect. The Strawberry Nirvana does have litchi, which is forgivable when you add the Velvet Falernum and ginger root along with the Grey Goose le Citron. Gin Lane, in the meatpacking district, also serves a Tea Time Martini between 3 and 6 p.m., which is good for those who like their Hendrick’s gin with yuzu, maraschino liqueur, lime and grapefruit.Mas A French restaurant in the West Village that Frank Bruni, the restaurant critic for The Times, said in 2004 was “an earnest, tasteful restaurant” that “nicely splits the difference between fussy and unfussy,” has a seasonal cocktail menu that, for this winter at least, tends toward traditional drinks with quality though somewhat nontraditional ingredients. The Mas Manhattan uses rye with pricey Vya vermouth, house-made orange bitters and cherries steeped in brandy. An Old-Fashioned pops in some vanilla and orange zest; again, the bitters are house-made. Those who can stomach the stiff drinks, but not entrees that cost more than $30, can sit at one of the tables near the small bar.Counter Is the first thing that crosses your mind when you do a shot of vodka, “My, this doesn’t taste organic”? If so, or even if not, then the drinks made from entirely organic liquor (though tequila stops at “sustainable”) at this vegetarian East Village restaurant are still intriguing. The Up All Night, made with cocoa, vanilla-infused (organic) vodka and espresso beans might seem only moderately indulgent if it were not for the stripe of fudge rimming the glass. Married in a Fever has red wine, poached pear and (organic) vodka, this time infused with pear.O.K., so the names might sound cutesy enough to come from a once-hep martini menu, but it’s what’s in the glass that counts.Pegu Club, 77 West Houston Street (up the stairs) between West Broadway and Wooster Street, (212) 473-7348; www.peguclub.com.Employees Only, 510 Hudson Street between Christopher and West 10th Streets,(212) 242-3021; www.employeesonlynyc.com.Counter, 105 First Avenue between Sixth and Seventh Streets, (212) 982-5870; www.counternyc.com.'"

"'06-12-25,'0','In Spanish, the word bimbo has no specific meaning, similar to the way the Häagen-Dazs name was made up in order to sell ice cream. When Grupo Bimbo was founded in 1945, according to the company’s official history, it came up with the name through a combination of the words Bambi, the animated Disney movie released three years earlier, and bingo, a popular lottery in Mexico at the time. The company, whose logo is a small teddy bear, has marketed its products for more than 20 years in the United States, primarily in areas with large Hispanic populations.Confusion over marketing slogans has also traveled north to south. A maker of T-shirts in Miami was trying to capture the Hispanic market during a visit by Pope John Paul II in 1987. The shirts were supposed to read “I Saw the Pope” (el papa) but instead said “I Saw the Potato” (la papa), according to the Web site moronland.com. Coors also had a translation problem in 1983, when its slogan “Turn It Loose” ended up meaning “suffer from diarrhea.”“Chivas is the perfect fit for Bimbo, and honestly, I never really thought of it in that other connotation,” said Kathy Carter, an executive vice president for Soccer United Marketing, the league’s marketing arm, in New York. She added that Chivas had not yet made a decision on what its jersey sponsor would be. “The value will be driven by what teams create,” she said. “The reputation of the club — wins, losses, winning tournaments — will go a long way toward determining value.”She added: “What’s important is that this gets people talking about Chivas and people can go on all they want. This is a bread company. You can bet the next time Hispanic people hear Tony Kornheiser go on about it, they will turn off their televisions when he’s broadcasting a ‘Monday Night Football’ game.”The opinion is much the same in Southern California.“Our current and target fans will know what it means; there will be no miscommunication,” said Eddie Salcedo, the director of partnership development for the Anschutz Entertainment Group, which holds the marketing rights to Chivas USA. “We’re not afraid to partner with them. This is the ultimate brand-awareness tool.”Salcedo said that A.E.G. and Chivas expected its sponsor, whether it is Bimbo or another company, to pay more than $1 million a year. (Consider what the Los Angeles Galaxy can expect a sponsor to offer if the club signs the English star David Beckham.)In the United States, team jerseys in major pro leagues have been almost sacrosanct, but seemingly everything else has been for sale; stadium naming rights and signage at arenas are the most obvious examples. Television timeouts have been added. And baseball increased the time between innings to give sponsors more time to sell things like beer and drugs to fight erectile dysfunction.In Europe, advertising on team jerseys, in soccer and other sports, has been around for more than 30 years. Last year, Manchester United of England signed a four-year shirt sponsorship deal for $106 million with the American International Group, an insurance company. Chelsea, another English club, is receiving $18.7 million a season from a five-year deal with Samsung.In Spain, Barcelona, which had not had a sponsor’s name on its shirt, decided to take an altruistic tack. The club is paying Unicef, the United Nations Children’s Fund, $2 million a year for the next five years to use its logo in all competitions.Other United States companies put their names on the jerseys of European teams in an attempt to increase their presence overseas. Several years ago, Ty, the company that makes Beanie Babies, put its logo on the shirts of Portsmouth in England.During a recent sports industry conference in New York, N.F.L. Commissioner Roger Goodell said that the current model of sponsors’ buying advertising time on TV was enough, for now. Bud Selig, the commissioner of baseball, told Reuters that the game was “held to a different standard” and that “part of the lure of our game is the history and tradition.”Last month, Real Salt Lake became the first club to announce a sponsorship deal. “The aura of soccer is very different from other sports,” said Dave Checketts, the owner of Real Salt Lake. The team signed a four-year deal with XanGo, a Utah-based company that makes juices and other products from the mangosteen fruit. XanGo will pay Real Salt Lake more than $500,000 but less than $1 million a year.“For the other sports, there is a group of owners who would not let it happen,” Checketts said. “It means one thing to the Kansas City Royals and another thing to the New York Yankees. There is something about a city name on the jersey that seems sacred to them.”XanGo, Checketts said, was the sponsor of a game in August, when Real Madrid played in Utah.“They were incredibly pleased that their name was broadcast around the world to 130 countries and that they got their name out in Madrid in a big way,” he said. “The day after the league announced plans to sell the front of the jersey, they were in the door. They sold 7,000 jerseys to their distributors. That’s more than we’ve sold in two years.”M.L.S. is ready to join the rest of the soccer world and turn its players into walking billboards, and is willing to endure the snickers and barbs. Carter of Soccer United Marketing asserted that there was more at stake.“We are part of the global economy,” Carter said. “We are evolving as a country, and in the global economy we have a seat at the table — we no longer own the table. It is naïve for people not to understand that the United States is the largest Hispanic economy in the world. It’s not about excluding, it’s about including.”'"
"'06-12-25,'0','“President Abbas should have met with Prime Minister Ismail Haniya to form a national unity government,” Ismail Radwan, a spokesman for Hamas, said Sunday.Mr. Olmert, speaking at the beginning of the weekly cabinet meeting, said he expected to hold additional meetings with Mr. Abbas. “Our intention is to begin ongoing negotiations in order to advance the peace process that we want so much,” Mr. Olmert said.At the meeting Saturday, the Israeli leader also pledged to remove some West Bank checkpoints and to allow more trucks to travel to the main cargo crossing between the Gaza Strip and Israel.There was no agreement on the release of Palestinian prisoners, an issue the Palestinians consider very important. Israel’s position has been that Palestinian militants must release an Israeli soldier they captured in June before a significant number of Palestinian prisoners are freed.However, at the Israeli cabinet meeting, several ministers raised the possibility of releasing at least some Palestinian prisoners before the Muslim holiday of Id al-Adha, which begins Saturday. Israel has done so in the past, and Mr. Olmert said he was willing to consider the proposal in the coming days, an official who was at the meeting said.Since Hamas came to power in the spring, Israel has been withholding tax and customs revenue it collects on behalf of the Palestinians, and the money now totals about $500 million.Before Israel cut off the money, it was sent to the Palestinian Finance Ministry for general budget expenditures. Now it will be channeled through Mr. Abbas’s office.While the money could restock hospital supplies and meet other pressing Palestinian needs, it falls well short of the $150 million or more needed to cover a single month of the Palestinian Authority’s budget.“The money withheld by Israel is Palestinian money, and Israel has no right to control it,” said Ghazi Hamad, a spokesman for the Hamas-led government. “It’s ours, and they use this money to pressure the Palestinians.”Hamas has always refused to deal with Israel and has argued that negotiations with it have produced few gains for the Palestinians. Over all, Palestinians seemed less than impressed with the meeting’s outcome.“In the Palestinian view, the Israeli concessions to Mahmoud Abbas are very minor,” said Mkhaimar Abusada, a political science professor at Al Azhar University in Gaza City. “Also, this will definitely have a negative effect on his relations with Hamas.”In another development, the militant Palestinian faction Islamic Jihad claimed responsibility for firing rockets from the Gaza Strip into southern Israel. Israeli officials say the persistent rocket fire will lead to an Israeli response.'"
"'06-12-25,'0','Germany brushed aside the need to renegotiate the 16-year-old treaty signed by Berlin and Warsaw after the fall of Communism. The treaty confirmed the post-World War II borders between the countries and foreclosed any claims by the German state on territory lost to Poland after the war.The trouble is, the treaty did not deal with claims made by individuals. These new claims have reopened old wounds in Poland, where some people accuse Germans of trying to create a moral equivalence between the suffering of Germans and the suffering they inflicted on others.The German government said it did not support the claims of the group, known as the Prussian Trust, but it also did not plan to impede them, since displaced Germans are an influential constituency here.After the end of World War II, more than 12 million Germans were expelled from territories that are now part of Poland and other Eastern European countries. The Federation of Expellees, the main lobbying group for these people, has kept the issue alive in Germany, sponsoring an exhibit in Berlin last summer that also provoked outrage on the part of Polish leaders.But even the federation has kept its distance from the Prussian Trust, which filed 22 claims with the Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg, France. Critics here said the group — which is small and consists largely of people who were expelled from the former Silesia — had reactionary tendencies.Rudi Pawelka, a retired policeman who is the director of the Prussian Trust, said its goal was both symbolic and concrete. “We want the injustice of our expulsion to be recognized, and for there to be compensation,” he said in an interview. “And there the question of property ownership becomes relevant.”Mr. Pawelka said the Prussian Trust chose to file claims with the Court of Human Rights because other displaced groups had successfully pressed their cases there. Poland, as a member of the European Union, would also be subject to any decision handed down by the court, he said.German officials said the lawsuit was hopeless, and would only antagonize Polish officials — a point that seemed indisputable, given the statements by the foreign minister and the twin brothers who govern Poland, President Lech Kaczynski and Prime Minister Jaroslaw Kaczynski.Some analysts said there was little that Germany could do but try to stay above the fray. The Kaczynski brothers, they said, were exploiting anti-German sentiment to fuel a new wave of Polish nationalism.The government of Chancellor Angela Merkel has tried to support Poland in other ways, including its running conflict with Russia over Moscow’s ban on Polish meat products. That ban has led Poland to delay a broader partnership agreement between Russia and Europe.Some experts on German-Polish relations said the vitriol of Poland’s leaders masked what was a generally healthy relationship on other levels. Trade between Germany and Poland is busy, and there are many exchanges between academics, students, and legislative officials.'"
"'06-12-25,'0','Many residents and political experts say that the large number of potential candidates reflects how the area’s varied groups feel they should make a claim for the office. Further, such open seats come along only rarely, and no member of the well-known Clarke family is running this year.“I think there are as many reasons as there are people running,” Ms. Clarke said of the race to succeed her. “Each of them has a story. But I think the interest is largely because opportunities for people to serve in legislative bodies in an open race are few and far between. And if anyone has political aspirations, an open seat is attractive, and the opportunities are limited.”But the ethnic factor has magnified the dynamics of this free-for-all. For one thing, the 40th Council District, which is anchored in Crown Heights and Flatbush, covers an area of Brooklyn that is home to a large segment of New York City’s Caribbean residents. And many politically active residents are eager to see a native of their respective countries — whether Jamaica, Haiti, Trinidad or others — represent the district.“Many people feel that it’s their time, particularly in the Haitian community,” said Michael Gaspard, a political consultant who has worked for candidates in many races in central Brooklyn.“The other important factor is the fact that this is a politically active community that was very active and involved in the Congressional race and in supporting Yvette Clarke,” Mr. Gaspard said. “If you visit that district, you’ll find that politics is important to people, whether it’s politics in their home island or in New York.”Several of the potential candidates are Jamaican, and several are Haitian. And there have even been meetings among Haitian civic leaders about narrowing the field to give one candidate a better chance of victory.“There are three or four Haitian candidates who are thinking about running,” said Emmanuel Roi, a former prosecutor who is in private practice at a Brooklyn law firm. “But this is an attractive opportunity for many people,” said Mr. Roi, whose family is from Haiti. He said that he would decide soon whether he would officially enter the race. “There are meetings going on now to reduce the number. We’ll see what happens.”But the ethnicity of the candidates extends far beyond the Caribbean. One candidate, Moe Razvi, a Pakistan-born businessman, said he would open his campaign headquarters next week.“This is a highly diverse district, with a growing population of people from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka,” said Mr. Razvi, who runs a community center offering legal advice, computer classes and English instruction.Most of the candidates are black, and the district is 72 percent black, according to the 2000 census. At least one, Mr. Razvi, is Asian and at least one is white: Harry Shiffman, who is director of government and community relations with the Kingsbrook Jewish Medical Center.Some of the potential candidates have run for office before. In fact, one, Jesse Hamilton, ran this year for an Assembly seat in Brooklyn and lost to the incumbent, Karim Camara. Another is Zenobia McNally, who lost to Ms. Clarke in the 2005 City Council race. Another is Geoffrey A. Davis, whose brother, James E. Davis, represented the area in the City Council until he was killed in July 2003 in City Hall.Some have close ties to Ms. Clarke, such as Jennifer James, who was a fund-raiser for Ms. Clarke’s Congressional race.So far, no date has been set for a special election to succeed Ms. Clarke, although it will most likely take place in February. Under the City Charter, such special elections are nonpartisan races in which candidates are barred from running on the ballot lines of established political parties.Mr. Lopez, the Brooklyn Democratic leader, said he was meeting with the various candidates, but had not decided whether the party would support any one in the heavily Democratic district. Although candidates cannot run on the lines of established parties, party organizations can offer assistance to a candidate.For her part, Ms. Clarke said she likely would endorse a candidate, and that she had narrowed that field to two or three of those interested in running.'"
"'06-12-25,'0','Irma Cooper, a 92-year-old who joined the church decades ago, stood nearby in a bright blue suit. “I’m Hog Mountain,” she said.Pastor Williams has complained that the name made him the object of ridicule. “A lot of people in the community resent the word hog; they don’t like it,” he said. “In reference to the Bible, swine is associated with sin.”But for many people, Hog Mountain is nothing to be ashamed of. The name change, approved by a congregational vote, has raised an outcry among old-timers, current and former church members, and even the Gwinnett County Historical Society, which sent a chiding letter.Robin Rundbaken, 36, who moved to the Hamilton Mill subdivision three years ago, said she had not heard about the hubbub at the church but would prefer that places kept their historic names. “I’m old-fashioned that way,” she said. “I would rather they do that than try to appeal to the yuppie prestigious name thing. And I would think it’s a slap in the face to the members that have grown up here.”But Pastor Williams said he had no need to explain replacing such an ungainly moniker. “The general public knows why we changed the name,” he said. “I don’t think they’re interested in history.”Hog Mountain, 40 miles from Atlanta, was never an official town, but the community began in the early 1800s. There was a fort, a trading post and an inn called the Hog Mountain House. The church was founded in 1854 by 11 members, led by Elders David H. Moncrief and Amos Hadaway, according to a historical marker near the front door. The current building was constructed in 1905.Gwinnett County has changed drastically since then, especially in recent years, as farmland has been taken over by the spreading suburbs of Atlanta. Since 1990, the county has more than doubled in population, and traffic has become extremely heavy. “Some days it takes 10 minutes to get out of my driveway,” said Claudette Miller, a church member who opposed the name change.Ms. Miller said she always thought it was cool to be from a place called Hog Mountain: “People would say, ‘You must be a hick,’ and I would say, ‘Yep!’ ”She remembered the church’s recent celebration of its 150th anniversary. The women dressed in hoop skirts, the men in top hats. The children looked like little Pilgrims. “I thought we were so proud then,” Ms. Miller said. “What happened?”Betty Warbington, a longtime member of the church who left in 1995, about the time Pastor Williams returned, has written passionate letters and a newspaper column criticizing the change as a crime against history.She details how her husband’s father went to the church on wintry Sunday mornings and lighted the pot-bellied stove before the service. Ms. Warbington’s uncle was a chorister, and her aunt was the church pianist, a position Ms. Warbington herself held for more than two decades. She and her husband plan to be buried in the church’s cemetery.Ms. Warbington said she suspected that the name was changed in retaliation against those who blocked Pastor Williams’s plan to sell the church ball field, next to the oldest part of the cemetery, to a strip mall developer. Pastor Williams said he intended to use the money to build a gym for younger church members. “If young people don’t take over the church, it will die,” he said.Although the congregation voted 3 to 1 in favor of the name change, it was difficult to find proponents who would explain their reasons. Church members have tired of publicity and have been asked not to discuss the issue.But evidently, the name is no more likely to appeal to the young than the old. Traci Drinkwater, 15, a member, and her friend Elyse Young, 17, a frequent visitor, said they preferred the name Hog Mountain.“Everything’s changing to fit the Hamilton Mill folk,” Elyse said. “They’re snooty. Money’s what it’s all about.”Traci added: “If they weren’t coming here with the old name, then they wouldn’t be coming here for the right reasons. It’s not the name, it’s what’s on the inside.”'"
"'06-12-25,'0','But what was indisputably real was her eye for talent. Her clients, mostly lesser-known playwrights and directors when she first began working with them, included Douglas Carter Beane, Seth Zvi Rosenfeld, Matthew Penn, Brad Anderson, Alison Maclean, Mr. Brokaw and Mr. Silver, a group of artists she promoted with religious fervor.“She was sort of the picker of hothouse orchids,” said the writer Jon Robin Baitz, who knew her but was not represented by her.It was not her negotiating that set her apart; it was her conviction that her writers and directors, these artists on the periphery, deserved a place in the marketplace. She persuaded them of their as-yet-unrecognized gifts, and then made sure the recognition came. She was, as Mr. Beane, put it, “an enthusiast.” (Characters in several of Mr. Beane’s plays, including the agent in “The Little Dog Laughed,” now on Broadway, were partly inspired by Ms. Meagher.)But as tireless as Ms. Meagher was in convincing her artists of their worth, her friends said, she could never do so for herself. She drank with abandon. Her personal life, her health and her finances she treated with a reckless neglect, all along maintaining a wit and charisma that enthralled almost anyone who came in contact with her.Few people knew of Ms. Meagher’s past, which she never talked about. She was born in England, where her father was studying literature; after a few years hopping from college to college in America and Europe, the family settled in Toronto.In her youth she was precocious and impatient, said Ms. Meagher’s brother Sean, who lives in Toronto. But her sadness was also visible early on, noticeable in grade school pictures, the effect of experiences in her early childhood which would permanently mark her. “There was a legitimate cause to her sadness,” he said, declining to elaborate further.She left home and school at 17 to live with a group of literary bohemians in downtown Toronto, her brother said. Soon after, she met an up-and-coming actor, married and moved to New York. Her husband was determined to break into the theater scene but moved back to Toronto within a year.Ms. Meagher stayed, though it would be years before they actually divorced. She worked alongside aspiring actors and writers in a restaurant on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, learning about the life of the undiscovered artist and, until the other waiters found out, sleeping in the kitchen at night.When a few of the actors began working at a downtown theater, Ms. Meagher signed on to be a house manager. One night in 1982 she met David Guç, a vice president at Don Buchwald & Associates, the talent agency. She told him she wanted to be an agent; he hired her as a receptionist.Two years later, having worked her way up to the position of literary agent, Ms. Meagher helped Mr. Guç establish the Gersh Agency, and she began to build a reputation as a spirited advocate of budding talent.The William Morris Agency hired her in 1993, and most of her loyal clients followed. From her summers, which she spent at the New York Stage and Film workshops at Vassar College, she developed an even longer client list and moved on to independent film projects, taking on more clients like Mr. Anderson, the director of “Next Stop Wonderland,” and Ms. Maclean, the director of “Jesus’ Son.”Work was her entire life, friends said, morning to night at the theater and in the show business hot spots. Every conversation was about this marvelously gifted playwright whose work one simply must see or this sadly awful play from last night.Her friends and lovers were some of the theater and independent film industry’s most prominent names — actors, writers, producers — though her energies were not focused on domestic stability. The owner of the Jujamcyn theaters, Rocco Landesman, whom she dated, remembered taking her to an opening-night party. She left with someone else, but had the wit to send Mr. Landesman flowers the next day.“She lived her clients’ lives,” Mr. Landesman said. “She was totally dedicated to them, and she really didn’t have a life beyond that.”It was not a secret, those who knew her said, that by the mid-90s, the rest of her life was falling into disrepair. The tarantula lay dead in its cage for weeks in her apartment. Her wardrobe was becoming haphazard, careless.“People around her recognized that she was doomed if nothing happened,” the writer John Patrick Shanley said.Still, partly through sheer charisma, she was able to set up her budding New York playwrights with television and film projects, get Mr. Shanley’s screenplays published almost on a whim, negotiate a three-picture deal with Miramax for Mr. Anderson, sell Mr. Beane’s scripts to Hollywood and bring Hollywood money to the Drama Dept., an Off Broadway theater company. The whispering was growing, though, about her behavior at parties, the unpaid loans from friends, her tardiness or even absence from important meetings. William Morris quietly sponsored a stint in out-patient rehab, but she did not finish it, and she left the agency in 1998.Many of her clients were not ready to give up on her. Mr. Beane, newly well-off from the movie deals she had brokered, said he paid for her to stay at the Betty Ford Center. When she returned, Mr. Beane and Mr. Anderson created a management firm for her, Independent Artists.“As agents,” Ms. Meagher said in a 1998 article in Daily Variety about the firm, “we become so focused on the future, the things artists could attain but don’t yet have, that we often overlook servicing the present.”The firm did not last a year. She fell back into drinking; a boyfriend pulled her into hard drugs. The writers who had been as loyal to Ms. Meagher as they had been to anyone in the business had to tell her they were moving on.“My friends were doing interventions with me, saying, ‘You have to let go, this is not healthy,’ ” said Mr. Beane, who worked with her longer than almost anyone.About six years ago Ms. Meagher disappeared from most people’s lives for good. Her brother Sean, who stayed in contact with her, said that when she had lost hope of recovery she did not want to be around the people she knew.“If she couldn’t be that vibrant, vivacious asset that she’d always been to them,” he said, “she just wanted to step away.”She married a building superintendent, her brother said, who took care of her as her health deteriorated. Their last address was at Ninth Avenue and 50th Street, on the edge of the theater district.“As a representative,” said Raelle Koota, who worked with Ms. Meagher at Gersh, “you devote your life and energy to other people, giving esteem to other people, boosting other people. I think Mary was sort of someone who gave esteem to everybody else but didn’t want to accept any herself.”'"
"'06-12-25,'0','SHANGHAI, Dec. 24 (Reuters) — The China Life Insurance Company, China’s biggest life insurer, set the price range in its $3.6 billion initial public offering lower than expected on Sunday in a move that is likely to ensure huge demand for the offer.The range for the stock sale, the second-largest domestic offering in China, was set at 18.16 to 18.88 yuan a share ($2.33 to $2.42), China Life said in a statement to the Shanghai Stock Exchange.China Life, based in Beijing, plans to sell as many as 1.5 billion local currency A-shares, equivalent to 5.3 percent of its expanded share capital, meaning it could raise as much as 28.32 billion yuan, or $3.6 billion.The price range was well below the forecasts of many brokerage officials and analysts.

"'06-12-25,'0','On Friday, a Microsoft executive posted a comment on a company security information Web site stating the company was “closely monitoring” the vulnerability described by the Russian Web site. It permits the privileges of a standard user account in Vista and other versions of Windows to be increased, permitting control of all of the operations of the computer. In Unix and modern Windows systems, users are restricted in the functions they can perform, and complete power is restricted to certain administrative accounts.“Currently we have not observed any public exploitation or attack activity regarding this issue,” wrote Mike Reavey, operations manager of the Microsoft Security Response Center. “While I know this is a vulnerability that impacts Windows Vista, I still have every confidence that Windows Vista is our most secure platform to date.”On Saturday, Nicole Miller, a Microsoft spokeswoman, said the company was also investigating the reported browser flaw and that it was not aware of any attacks attempting to use the vulnerability.Microsoft has spent millions branding the Vista operating system as the most secure product it has produced, and it is counting on Vista to help turn the tide against a wave of software attacks now plaguing Windows-based computers.Vista is critical to Microsoft’s reputation. Despite an almost four-and-half-year campaign on the part of the company, and the best efforts of the computer security industry, the threat from harmful computer software continues to grow. Criminal attacks now range from programs that steal information from home and corporate PCs to growing armies of slave computers that are wreaking havoc on the commercial Internet.Although Vista, which will be available on consumer PCs early next year, has been extensively tested, it is only now being exposed to the challenges of the open Internet.“I don’t think people should become complacent,” said Nand Mulchandani, a vice president at Determina. “When vendors say a program has been completely rewritten, it doesn’t mean that it’s more secure from the get-go. My expectation is we will see a whole rash of Vista bugs show up in six months or a year.”The Determina executives said that by itself, the browser flaw that was reported to Microsoft could permit damage like the theft of password information and the attack of other computers.However, one of the principal security advances of Internet Explorer 7 is a software “sandbox” that is intended to limit damage even if a malicious program is able to subvert the operation of the browser. That should limit the ability of any attacker to reach other parts of the Vista operating system, or to overwrite files.However, when coupled with the ability of the first flaw that permits the change in account privileges, it might then be possible to circumvent the sandbox controls, said Alexander Sotirov, a Determina security researcher. In that case it would make it possible to alter files and potentially permanently infect a target computer. This kind of attack has yet to be proved, he acknowledged.The Determina researchers said they had notified Microsoft of four other flaws they had discovered, including a bug that would make it possible for an attacker to repeatedly disable a Microsoft Exchange mail server simply by sending the program an infected e-mail message.Last week, the chief technology officer of Trend Micro, a computer security firm in Tokyo, told several computer news Web sites that he had discovered an offer on an underground computer discussion forum to sell information about a security flaw in Windows Vista for $50,000. Over the weekend a spokesman for Trend Micro said that the company had not obtained the information, and as a result could not confirm the authenticity of the offer.Many computer security companies say that there is a lively underground market for information that would permit attackers to break in to systems via the Internet.'"

Gazprom, the world’s largest energy company by volume of reserves, is insisting that Belarus pay more than double its current price, though it would remain below what richer countries in Europe pay.Gazprom warned that Belarus was behaving “irresponsibly” in the talks over pricing and a Russian demand to surrender equity in a key export pipeline, saying such resistance was putting Belarus’s energy supply at risk.The threat came almost exactly a year after Gazprom cut off fuel supplies to Ukraine, another key transit country for Russian energy exports, causing intense supply jitters in Western Europe. After widespread criticism, Gazprom turned the gas back on after three days.'"

"'06-12-26,'1','In absolute terms, the amount of money spent on advertising on mobile phones has been small but it has been growing rapidly. In 2005, advertisers spent $45 million on such messages, and should spend around $150 million this year, according to Ovum Research, which projects that such spending will reach $1.3 billion by 2010.The interest of advertisers in the medium stems from a theory that ads placed on mobile phones could create a particularly intimate bond with consumers. The gadgets are ubiquitous, personal, and messages could theoretically be tailored to individuals based on demographics like age, gender and location.Numerous factors have limited the growth of cellphone advertising. Chief among those factors has been the reticence of carriers to allow ads to appear alongside news, sports and other information that is provided by their official content partners. These partners, from ESPN to USA Today and dozens of others, appear on the content menus that subscribers see when they use their phones to search for information over the Internet.Carriers have also been concerned about annoying cellphone users with obtrusive marketing messages.In October, Sprint became the first major carrier to allow advertisements to appear with content that is listed on its menus, or as they are known in the industry, their official content “decks.” Cingular, the nation’s largest wireless carrier, declined to comment on whether it would allow advertising on its decks.The participation of the carriers would greatly broaden the potential audience. Seventy to 80 percent of what people view on their cellphones derives from links on these decks. The rest of the content is viewed “off deck” — on innumerable content sites that wireless consumers are free to access over the Internet.Lack of access to these cellphone screens “is one of the biggest considerations right now,” and has limited growth, said Angela Steele, a mobile marketing expert at Starcom USA, a media buying and planning firm whose clients include Kellogg, Nintendo, Oracle and Allstate.Even without cooperation from carriers, advertisers have been able to reach consumers visiting off-deck sites, and such marketing has grown in size and in scope.The first advertisers drawn to mobile phones tended to be quick-serve restaurants and hotels — businesses that people might want access to on the go. But increasingly, there is traditional brand marketing, said Jeff Janer, chief marketing officer for Third Screen Media, a mobile ad management company that pairs advertisers and agencies with providers of mobile content, like USA Today and the Weather Channel.Mr. Janer said an example of the evolution took place over the last few months as Unilever ran an I Can’t Believe It’s Not Butter campaign on mobile phones. The campaign, which Mr. Janer said cost $75,000 to $100,000, placed small banner ads on sites like the Weather Channel that urged consumers to click on a link to visit the “Kitchen of Love.” The link took them to a site featuring Fabio, the romance heartthrob, who is spokesman for the ad campaign.“It’s the first consumer products group we’ve run on mobile,” Mr. Janer said.Mr. Janer, echoing the sentiment of executives from traditional ad agencies, said that mobile phone ad budgets were growing. He said that a year ago, advertisers typically committed $25,000 for a campaign of four to six weeks. That figure is now $150,000 to $200,000, he said.The ads have tended to involve simple banners or text messages, like those connected to the “American Idol” show, in which consumers are urged to send in a vote. Or they have offered digital coupons, like those that allow Dunkin’ Donut customers to show a coupon on their phone at the counter to get a 99 cent latte. Or they have involved sweepstakes offers.Increasingly, driven by the growing capability and speed of wireless networks, they involve more intensive graphics, and, to a much lesser degree, video clips.Despite these developments, advertisers continue to have serious questions about the effectiveness of mobile ads. While acknowledging there is potential for a particularly intimate relationship with phone users, advertisers say there is a dearth of data about whether the ads are motivating consumer behavior.“There’s still a question of cost and value,” said David Cohen, executive vice president and United States director of digital communications for Universal McCann, an ad agency, whose clients include Microsoft, Sony, Johnson & Johnson and Wendy’s. The agency last week said it had signed a deal to use ad management software provided by Third Screen Media to deliver mobile ads and try to track their effectiveness.Mr. Cohen said mobile advertising still appeared to be costly and inefficient. Because of a constrained supply of quality ad space, he said, the cost per thousand impressions is around $40, compared to $10 to $15 on the Internet.David Goodrich, director of digital for the West Coast region for OMD, an ad agency, said he did not believe mobile advertising could be particularly effective until marketers could regularly and easily buy space for video clips.Advertisers “are crazed to get information” onto the phones, Mr. Goodrich said. But the effectiveness “will be really limited until you’ve enabled site, sound and motion.”That will not be happening anytime soon on Verizon, according to Mr. Harrobin. He said that during extensive tests the company did in determining whether to run ads, and how to run them, it determined that consumers find short, stand-alone video advertisements to be intrusive.But Mr. Harrobin said that in the tests, consumers did seem to accept a single banner at the top of a page.“What we don’t want to do is repeat the mistakes of the Internet — spam, interstitials, pop-ups,” Mr. Harrobin said. Bored, offended or inconvenienced consumers could quickly blame Verizon and leave for another service, hurting the wireless carrier’s core business and reducing its monthly subscription fees.“We offer voice services,” he said of Verizon’s core business. Advertising “is tertiary on top of that.”'"
"'06-12-26,'1','Then there are medical factors, of which osteoarthritis — the wear-and-tear kind — is most prominent. Arthritis can make joints stiff and painful, resulting in a loss of flexibility and mobility. Some medications taken by older people can cause dizziness or sleepiness and impair balance. People who have suffered a stroke or other neurological disorder may be unable to move normally.Other predisposing factors common among older people include cardiovascular disease and accumulated injuries that weaken the musculoskeletal system. Diminished vision caused perhaps by cataracts, glaucoma, macular degeneration or lack of proper glasses is also a factor in falls among the elderly.And when older people fall, their weakened bones are more likely to break. As many as one woman in four and one man in 15 over the age of 50 can expect to suffer a fracture during their remaining years.So, the first step is to build muscle strength in the thighs and trunk to increase stability. Try this simple exercise: Lie on your back on the floor and raise one leg at a time a foot off the floor, holding it there for 10 seconds. Gradually build up to 10 repetitions with each leg and you’ll see how much stronger your thigh muscles can get.Likewise, there are easy exercises to improve balance: Gently holding the back of a sturdy chair, raise one foot off the floor, then try to let go of the chair. Once that is mastered, try it with your eyes closed, then try it standing on your toes. Tai chi is also an excellent activity proven to improve balance and reduce falls.Daily stretches, especially of the legs and hips, can slow the loss of flexibility that can result in a fall.People over 50 — and especially those over 65 — should have annual eye exams by an ophthalmologist and not postpone getting new glasses or undergoing cataract surgery. Corneal implants inserted when cataracts are removed can improve visual acuity better than your current glasses.If you take medications, ask your pharmacist whether any of them, alone or in combination, may cause dizziness or sleepiness. If so, ask your doctor if a reduced dosage or another medication would be just as effective and safer.Don’t forget “dem bones,” which need to be strong if they are to remain intact should you fall. In addition to consuming adequate amounts of calcium and vitamin D, you need to do weight-bearing exercise. Bone-benefiting exercises include walking, step and water aerobics, dancing, yoga, tai chi, hiking and resistance training. Cycling and swimming, while excellent activities especially for people with arthritis, are not as effective as walking for strengthening bones, Mr. Franklin said.For additional guidance, see “Fall Prevention” by Gail Davies and Fran Scully (Infinity Publishing, 2006).About half of falls occur at home, so that’s the best place to start to prevent them. To keep from slipping or tripping, the MetLife Foundation offers these tips:Keep walking paths clear of furniture and other obstacles. Don’t leave objects like books, papers, shoes or blankets on the floor. Make sure wires are securely tacked to the floor or wall. If you have loose rugs, remove them or secure them with double-sided tape. If you are visiting a home with loose rugs, ask that they be picked up while you are there.Keep objects off the stairs. Stairways should be well lighted, top and bottom, with overhead lights that can be switched on at either end. Stairs should be kept in good repair, with firmly attached carpeting or nonslip rubber treads on each step. Always use a handrail, and if possible install handrails on both sides of the stairway.Improve lighting in and around your home. Switch from incandescent to fluorescent bulbs, which are brighter, last longer and cost less to operate. Place easily reachable lamps on both sides of your bed and a night light between the bedroom and bathroom. Hang lightweight curtains or shades on windows to reduce glare.Store frequently used items in the kitchen, bedroom and bathroom on shelves that you can reach without climbing or reaching high over your head. Never stand on a chair. If you must use a stool, get one with a frame you can hold onto.Install grab bars inside the bathtub and next to the toilet. Use a nonslip rubber mat (one with many small suction cups is best) or self-stick safety strips on the floor of the tub or shower. Use a nonslip bath mat or bathroom carpeting — tile floors are very slippery when wet.Always wear shoes both inside and outside the house. Avoid going barefoot or walking around in socks or slippers that lack a firm nonslip sole. If you are visiting someone who frowns on shoes indoors, take along shoes that are reserved for indoor use. And if your stability is questionable, do not wear high heels.Finally, Mr. Franklin said, know your surroundings. Learn where the booby-traps like potholes, uneven surfaces and broken pavement are located and avoid them. And don’t be shy about using a walking aid if your stability or footing is insecure.'"
"'06-12-26,'1','Dr. Jordan’s wife, Dr. Monica Morrow, a breast cancer surgeon, is chairwoman of the surgical oncology department at Fox Chase. Their offices, he says, are across the hall from each other, “so we are together 24 hours a day.”Q. Prempro, the combination drug that many women took for menopause symptoms, contains both estrogen and progestins. And the findings from the Women’s Health Initiative study suggested that estrogen alone has only a tiny effect, if any, on breast cancer risk. So which is the bad actor, progestins or estrogen? Or is it both hormones combined?A. We’ve known for 30 years that estrogen can directly cause the growth of breast cells and of endometrial cells. Estrogen is fuel for the fire. But progesterone seems to do different things in different places in a woman’s body. In the uterus, it stops the growth of the endometrium and makes it ready for implanting a fertilized egg. In breast cancer, estrogen causes a doubling of cancer cells every 36 hours. Soon, the growing tumor ball needs to increase its blood supply because cells in the middle are not getting enough food and oxygen. Progesterone seems to cause other cells, stromal cells, to gather around the ball of cancer cells and play a supporting role. Stromal cells are the woman’s own cells that researchers now think may be specifically selected to build an architecture and send out signals for more blood supply, more fuel.Q. That seems to be an unusual arrangement. Why would progesterone act on stromal cells in the breast?A. When a woman is pregnant, her breasts are much larger and her estrogen and progesterone levels are huge. Progesterone is sending out signals that provide a skeleton to build the breasts.Q. Was it a surprise to learn that estrogen and progestins can cause breast cancer?A. We’ve known there is a cause and effect with hormones and breast cancer since 1896. If a woman is premenopausal and she has breast cancer and you take out her ovaries, the tumors decrease in size. Not all the tumors — if you took 100 women who were premenopausal and took their ovaries out, 35 percent would have a response. And you could get a dramatic response. A tumor that was the size of a walnut could shrink in six months to the size of a pinhead. It turned out that the tumors that responded contained estrogen receptors. This became cause and effect — the estrogen receptor was the mechanism that estrogen used to stimulate tumors to grow. If there was no estrogen receptor, taking away estrogen didn’t do anything at all.Q. Did taking away estrogen ever make a breast cancer go away completely?A. This is the basic difficulty. We were dealing with advanced breast cancer, and what we saw was that we could get complete remissions in 4 or 5 percent of the women. In the majority of women, the remission would last for one to two years. Taking away estrogen slowed things down, it reversed the process, but it did not cure.Q. Do you agree with the latest analysis indicating that breast cancer is declining because so many women stopped taking Prempro and other menopausal hormones?A. Throughout the 1990s, physicians were recommending that menopausal women take hormone replacement therapy. What happens is that you increased the rate of breast cancer in the whole country. And it shifted the epidemiology. We have seen an increase in the percentage of estrogen-receptor-positive tumors in the 1990s and in the beginning of the 2000s, so that now 70 percent of tumors are estrogen-receptor positive.This was, if you like, consistent. Everything was ticking in. The Women’s Health Initiative and the Million Women Study in Britain really said: “Here’s a controlled series of studies comparing taking nothing with taking hormone replacement therapy. How many cancers were there at the end of the day?”The Women’s Health Initiative found a 23 percent increase in breast cancer; the Million Women Study found a 100 percent increase. Those studies were highly publicized and women stopped taking hormones. Now the breast cancer rates are going down. Now tumors you would have detected are not being detected. There is no proof the tumors will ever go away, but you can’t detect them. And it is possible that many subclinical cancer cells may never grow inside a woman’s breast if she has no estrogen around to fuel that fire.Q. If a woman has a tumor that is undetectable because she did not take menopausal hormones, will it eventually grow anyway and turn into a cancer that can be seen on a mammogram?A. We don’t know. What we have learned from the tamoxifen clinical trial is that tamoxifen, which blocks estrogen, did a fantastic job. The cancer rate in the group taking tamoxifen dropped by 50 percent. Tamoxifen prevented the development of breast cancers that were early stage, and it also stopped cells from progressing to breast cancer.Q. Some people suggest that the real problem was that the hormones women were taking were artificial or were given in artificial ways. Prempro, for example, gets its estrogen from pregnant mares. Some say other hormone preparations, for example, so-called bioidentical hormones, would be safe. Do you agree?A. We’ve been talking about women’s ovaries producing estrogen and progesterone. When a woman enters menopause, hormone levels drop dramatically. The longer you bathe a woman’s breasts in these hormones, the more likely she will have cancer. If you start menstruating early, if you have two extra years of estrogen in your body, bathing your breasts in that fuel is a risk factor for breast cancer. If you start menopause late, if your periods go on for an extra four or five years, that is a risk. The longer you have menstrual cycles, the higher your probability of breast cancer. And that is with natural hormones, the ones in your body.Q. What about birth control pills? Do they increase the risk of breast cancer?A. We have had testing of birth control pills in huge groups of women since the 1950s, and there really is no evidence of a significant rise in breast cancer risk. What we do know is that oral contraceptives reproduce the messages in the brain to stop a woman from ovulating. You are bathing a woman’s body with artificial hormones, but normally she would be bathing her own body with estrogen and progesterone. You don’t have women getting endometrial cancer, and oral contraceptives reduce the risk of getting ovarian cancer by 50 percent. It is one of the few things we know of that reduces the risk of ovarian cancer.Q. What about chemicals in the environment, like DDT or chemicals in plastics, that can mimic estrogen. Could they be causing breast cancer?A. There are a group of compounds like DDT that are byproducts of industry and are in our environment. They can affect cells in the laboratory and can affect the reproduction of animals, but in really huge doses. There is an effect, but does it cause an increase in cancer? I personally don’t believe that is the case. I don’t think there is enough around to do that. A pinch of estrogen in the environment is very small compared to the gallons in a woman’s body.Q. What should women do now? Should they ever take menopausal hormones?A. The value of hormone therapy for women with extremely severe menopausal symptoms is well established, and women, in consultation with their doctors, should consider using it for only a few months to alleviate severe symptoms. The main concern is using the drugs for many years to prevent osteoporosis. They can reduce the risk of hip fractures, but there are now many different alternatives for women to maintain bone density, such as bisphosphonates or raloxifene. Hormone replacement therapy should only be considered after all other options have failed.'"

"'06-12-27,'1','“We are going to give people an honest and contemplative body they can be proud of once more,” said Representative Louise Slaughter, Democrat of New York and the incoming chairwoman of the Rules Committee.Veteran Democrats said they did not sense that their colleagues wanted to retaliate against Republicans for perceived slights over the last decade. “We know we won in part because they got so nasty and unlikable,” said Representative Barney Frank, Democrat of Massachusetts.Mr. Frank and Representative Edward J. Markey, a fellow Massachusetts Democrat, pointed to another difference between incoming Democrats and the Republicans who took control in 1995 and saw their mission as one of purging Democrats and hobbling government.“Democrats want government to work,” said Mr. Markey, who under the Republican majority was often frozen out despite his senior position on the Energy and Commerce Committee. “I have not had a conversation where Democrats sit around talking about who they want to get back at.”Yet pledges to engage Republicans legislatively carry risks. If Democrats do not follow through or revert to practices they have spent recent years condemning, they are certain to come under attack from watchdog groups and Republicans. Republicans are already accusing Democrats of backsliding by not guaranteeing them hearings and amendments on legislation to be considered in an initial 100-hour legislative program that Democrats view as a showcase for their new majority.But Republicans are hoping Democrats stick to their guns and allow the minority a stronger voice on legislation. The opposition leadership said it would take the opportunity to put forward initiatives that could be potentially troublesome for newly elected Democrats in Republican-leaning districts who within months will have to defend their hard-won seats.“There are going to be days when we will offer alternatives in ways that are going to be very appealing to Democrats in districts the president carried just two years ago,” said Representative Roy Blunt of Missouri, who will be the second-ranking House Republican in the 110th Congress.Republicans see the ability to force tough votes — which they avoided in the majority by stifling Democratic alternatives — as having two potential benefits: It can put vulnerable Democrats on record with positions that might not be popular at home, or it can fracture the untested Democratic majority. Mr. Blunt noted that even senior Democrats who served in Congress when Democrats held control had no experience dealing with a relatively thin, 16-seat majority that will not allow many lawmakers to avoid tough votes.Democratic leaders said that in the spirit of a new beginning, they have every intention of allowing Republicans the kind of legislative opportunities that Republicans regularly denied Democrats. “Democracy is a risk,” said Representative Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland, the incoming majority leader. “And democracy is about alternatives.”But Mr. Hoyer and other Democrats also said that they were not naïve. If Republicans take the Democratic offer and try to advance politically charged amendments, Democrats will tighten the reins.“We may well reject amendments which are designed solely for the purposes of creating a 30-second ad,” Mr. Hoyer said. “We are not going to be foolish or stupid.”Democrats have not guaranteed Republicans an equal say, and the party’s pledge to the minority states only that legislation should “generally” come to a vote under rules that allow “open, full and fair debate.”But to Congress watchers who grew increasingly outraged over Republican conduct of the House during the rule of Mr. Hastert and the majority leader Tom DeLay, the Democrats are definitely heading in the right direction.“The House has been so egregiously run for a number of years that it was seen as contributing both directly and indirectly to the election results,” said Thomas Mann, a Congressional scholar at the Brookings Institution. “There really is a strong political incentive to try to do business differently.”Democrats said explicitly that they would abandon some of the most disputed Republican practices. They point in particular to the vote on Medicare prescription drug legislation in 2003, when Republicans refused to shut off a House vote for three hours so they could twist arms and push the measure through just before sunrise. Democrats stipulate that votes should be completed within 15 minutes and not held open simply to manipulate the outcome.Democrats are developing a proposal to guarantee that lawmakers have at least 24 hours to examine legislation. They have also called for “an end to the two-day work week” and the beginning of a “predictable, professional, family-friendly schedule that allows the legislative process to proceed in a manner that ensures timely and deliberative dispensation of the work of Congress.”In the House and Senate, the leadership is vowing to conduct full and open conference committees that reconcile differing legislation passed by the two chambers and produce a final bill. In recent years, those sessions have all but disappeared, with senior Republicans hashing out final versions behind closed doors, occasionally adding provisions passed by neither the House nor the Senate. Some of the major legislation approved in the final hours of the past Congress was written in private by just a few lawmakers and aides and rushed to the floor.Democrats said the Republican majority typically refused to tell them even where the supposedly bicameral, bipartisan conference sessions were being held.“We are going to have conferences with the House,” said Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the incoming majority leader, “real conferences, public conferences, where public issues will be debated and voted upon.”Republicans said that Democrats exaggerated the degree to which they were excluded from legislative operations and that the Republican majority was less oppressive than House Democrats had been in the latter part of their 40-year majority before losing power in 1994. And they said that Democrats did not want to work with them but were more interested in scoring political points.Democrats disputed those accusations. But even if there is some truth in them, they said, their years in the minority have made them newly sensitive to the need for a more democratic democracy.“They really had disenfranchised about half of the American citizens,” Ms. Slaughter said, referring to her Republican colleagues. “I felt my country was going down the drain. We are going to have a much more open process.”'"

Even if they do succeed in protesting an award, they say, and prove that federal agencies are intentionally awarding small-business contracts to big companies, there are almost no penalties. Often, the large companies get to keep the contacts.“It’s a hollow victory,” said Raul Espinosa, a small-business owner in Florida who has won several protests. “You might win the size protest, but you can’t claim the contract because the agency allowed delivery to take place and what’s worse, the penalties for the violations aren’t enforced.”Mr. Espinosa is leading a coalition of six small-business associations seeking to change the process.Congress may be more receptive to their calls for change next year, when two longtime critics of the practice assume leadership positions for the committees overseeing small business.Senator John F. Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts and the incoming chairman of the Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, has proposed giving the S.B.A. more time to complete size determinations and to help prevent big businesses from slipping under the radar of a bureaucratic contracting process.The S.B.A. recently required businesses to report their size every five years. Mr. Kerry’s proposal would make the reports annual.“The protest process is supposed to keep the system honest, but what’s the point of protesting a contract if nothing happens?” Senator Kerry saidNydia M. Velázquez, Democrat of New York and the incoming chairwoman of the House Small Business Committee, said she would work to rectify the problems faced by Mr. Cooper and other small businesses by ensuring that there is an effective protest system in place. She also wants to make sure that penalties are enforced.“The fact that large businesses are being awarded with small-business contracts, and that there is no system in place with penalties or consequences for this, is extremely concerning,” Ms. Velázquez said.If a small-business owner believes that a company has been illegally awarded a small-business contract the owner has several options in protesting the award.The first is to file a so-called size protest with the S.B.A., asserting that the competitor is too big.Under this process, a company has five days after being notified of a winning bidder to initiate the protest. If the agency decides that the winning company is not small, it can recommend that the contract be rescinded.But that almost never happens, Mr. Espinosa says.Last year, Mr. Espinosa protested an Air Force contract, offering documentation showing that the winning company was actually a subsidiary of a larger concern, and thus ineligible.At first, the S.B.A. ruled that the company was a small business, but Mr. Espinosa appealed the decision to the agency’s Office of Hearings and Appeals and an administrative law judge ruled in his favor. Despite the ruling, the winner kept the contract.“There needs to be some reform in the size protest system,” Mr. Espinosa said. “Otherwise, why should small-business owners bother and why would large companies worry about getting caught?”The S.B.A. said it could only recommend that contracts be rescinded and could not compel other agencies to follow the recommendation.Albert B. Krachman, a lawyer at the firm of Blank Rome in Washington, who has represented small businesses, said, “The system is basically set up in such a way that the policing is left up to the businesses themselves.”What’s more, he said, “There is no incentive from the contracting officers or other government officials to see if the companies they are giving small business set-asides to are indeed small-business concerns.”Gary M. Jackson, assistant administrator for size standards at the S.B.A., agrees that the policing of the small-business contracting system is left up to competitors, but asserts that they are in a better position than contracting officers to know which is a small business and which is not.Another remedy for small businesses is through the courts.As Mr. Cooper did, small-business owners can file lawsuits asserting that fraud was committed in the awarding of set-aside contracts to large businesses. But legal specialists say the filing false-claims lawsuits can be a costly undertaking. The law also contains several legal hurdles that make it almost impossible to win, they say.Mr. Cooper said that he was convinced that a lawsuit was his only hope.At first, Mr. Cooper and his lawyer argued in the Court of Federal Claims that the I.N.S. had not operated in good faith when it stopped giving him work on the contract.The I.N.S. said it was not satisfied with Mr. Cooper’s work and the cost associated with it. But in a deposition, a contacting officer at the agency said no evidence was ever offered to him questioning the quality of Mr. Cooper’s work. A government audit found that the cost was actually reasonable.Still, the court sided with the I.N.S. and said that because the agency had given Mr. Cooper the minimum amount on the contract there was no evidence the agency had not operated in good faith. Mr. Cooper appealed the ruling, but an appeals court upheld the lower court ruling.Mr. Cooper and his lawyer then filed a lawsuit in the Federal District Court for the District of Columbia. They argued that the two companies that had been awarded contracts to complete the work that Mr. Cooper’s firm had originally been awarded had committed fraud when they said that they were disadvantaged businesses.A lawyer for the companies, Bruce M. Ginsberg of the law firm of Davis and Gilbert in New York, denies that they ever misstated their size to the I.N.S. “These are multimillion-dollar companies,” Mr. Ginsberg said. “They would not represent themselves as small businesses. We have no idea how they came to be marked that way in the I.N.S. documents.”Among the evidence offered by Mr. Cooper were contract documents in which the companies were described as disadvantaged and a Justice Department investigative report showing that the companies had verbally confirmed their disadvantaged status with an officer at the I.N.S., though both companies were two of the largest advertising firms in the country.“We thought we had a slam-dunk,” said Cyrus Phillips, a lawyer doing pro bono work for Mr. Cooper.But when the judge ruled otherwise, he not only dismissed the case but also ordered Mr. Cooper to pay legal fees and other expenses to the companies he had sued.Mr. Cooper said the ruling was a fatal blow to his personal and professional life. The legal bills he incurred have left him bankrupt and out of work.“I did nothing wrong and tried to point out that the government was intentionally giving set-asides to large companies, and I’m the one who pays for it,” Mr. Cooper said. “I wish I’d never done business with the federal government.”'"
"'06-12-27,'1','But Mr. Plumeri, who refuses to discuss any potential acquisition plans, has not discouraged the speculation. He flashed a copy of a newspaper article about Willis and Marsh & McLennan on a big screen as he addressed his employees here, and he recently told analysts “it would be silly for me to tell you” that a major acquisition was out of the question.People who have been briefed on Mr. Plumeri’s plans say that he has outlined merging the two companies in several letters to Marsh and that he has not given up on the idea. Moreover, they say, he has the backing of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, the leveraged buyout firm in New York with a record of major deals. A spokesman for Marsh would not comment on the letters or other aspects of the reported proposal. A spokesman for Kohlberg Kravis did not return a reporter’s call.With $10 billion in revenue last year and 55,000 employees, Marsh is nearly five times larger than Willis. But some analysts say a merger could work. The companies have complementary strengths in different sectors of the market, administrative costs would be reduced and analysts say that Mr. Plumeri, who spent more than 30 years as a top executive at Citigroup and its predecessors, could command a much bigger operation.“Joe could pull it off,” said Cliff H. Gallant, an analyst at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods. “He’s got a lot of leadership skills and a lot of credibility with the Street.”Mr. Plumeri, who favors two-tone shirts and flashy ties, was chosen as chief executive of Willis six years ago by Henry R. Kravis, one of the founding members of Kohlberg Kravis. He and Mr. Kravis remain close and Kohlberg Kravis, which briefly owned Willis, still has one of its executives on the Willis board.Mr. Plumeri’s visit to Nashville was the first stop on a tour of Willis’s operations in the United States and England to lay out expansion plans for the next four years. He warmed up his audience in a two-hour talk with stories about growing up Italian-American in a working-class section of Trenton, N.J., and said Willis planned to expand its business in coverage for airlines, cargo and cruise ships and armored car companies.He also said it would expand beyond its traditional base of midsize companies to more small and large customers, and that Willis would extend its reach in China and India.Mr. Plumeri said he was shooting to double the company’s stock price to $80 in the next four years. The stock closed yesterday at $40.39 in regular trading, up 10 percent for the year and about 9 percent from its price in late 2004, before Eliot Spitzer, the New York attorney general and governor-elect, accused the industry of taking kickbacks and steering business. In a lawsuit, he also accused Marsh of rigging bids.The brokers denied that they had acted improperly. But they agreed to stop receiving undisclosed payments from insurance companies and to pay hundreds of millions to settle the cases. In addition, 20 executives at insurance companies and at Marsh pleaded guilty to criminal charges relating to bid-rigging.Marsh’s stock closed yesterday at $30.56, up from a low for the year in August of $26.16, but still down 34 percent from immediately before the accusations. The stock of Aon, a Chicago company that by most measures is the second-largest broker, closed at $35.50, up less than 1 percent for the year, but about 30 percent higher than before the scandal.For the first nine months of this year, Willis has reported revenue growth of 8 percent, compared with 5 percent for Aon and 2 percent for Marsh. Willis’s credit rating at Standard & Poor’s has also risen a notch while the ratings of Marsh and Aon have declined — though Aon’s rating remains a notch higher than Willis’s.Willis began winning business from rivals as the claims of misconduct upended decades-long relationships. And Mr. Plumeri moved in to recruit brokers that analysts say are bringing many of their old customers along to their new firm.“There is a general shift in how large clients perceive the brokers,” said Meyer Shields, an analyst at Stifel, Nicolaus & Company.Marsh, the hardest hit by the scandal, has laid off more than 5,000 employees and eliminated perks like limousines and executive dining rooms that had made the brokerage business one of the clubbiest in the world.Now the big brokers are operating along lines that Willis adopted when Mr. Plumeri became chief executive. “More on the Charles Schwab model; no frills,” said Chris O’Kane, the chief executive of Aspen Insurance Holdings, a recent start-up insurer that specializes in catastrophe coverage.Mr. Plumeri played halfback and second base at the College of William and Mary and likes to say that “Willis is a team sport.” He insists that employees wear lapel pins with the Willis name superimposed on a rippling flag. To encourage chatter and cooperation, he has chopped down the walls of office cubicles to half-size and said that when Willis moves shortly into new space in New York and London, the executive offices will have no doors.At the end of Mr. Plumeri’s day in Nashville, Willis threw a party for everyone, from the mailroom staff to the top regional executives.The music was loud and the dance floor was crowded. Mr. Plumeri tossed off his suit jacket and jumped into a long conga line. Then he moved onto the dance floor as the music shifted to disco, raised an arm in a pumping motion and began gyrating with a handful of employees.For Mr. Plumeri, it was all part of the job. “This is about feeling good,” he said. “I want people to feel good about themselves and about the company. And I want them to know somebody human is running the place.”'"
"'06-12-27,'1','Founded in 1985, Maryland’s program is one of the oldest in the nation. Dr. Alan Sherman, the program’s director since 1991, said university officials supported the scholarships not only to attract good students but also to raise the profile of the institution. Dr. Sherman estimated that the program cost about $250,000 a year.For that investment, the university has one of the most successful chess teams in the country. It has won the Pan American Intercollegiate Team Chess Championships, the elite event in college chess, many times, including in 2005. The other big winner nationwide is the University of Texas at Dallas.Dr. Sherman said having a successful chess team benefited the university. “I see the competitive team as a means towards a more important end, which is bringing smart people to campus who will do things in math and science and other fields,” he said.Usually, Dr. Sherman said, there are eight students on chess scholarships. The best scholarships cover tuition, room and board, and are worth $69,400 over four years. For that package, Dr. Sherman said, a student must meet several requirements, including maintaining a grade point average of at least 3.0 and achieving nearly a grandmaster rank in chess.Katerina Rohonyan and Bruci Raul Lopez have such scholarships this year. Ms. Rohonyan, 22, a junior originally from Ukraine, is a computer science major. After she graduates, she said, “I think I will probably work, but I will try to play chess more often.”Mr. Lopez, 22, a senior born in Cuba who is an information systems major, said he wanted to get a job in his field of study. “I can always play chess,” he said.Mr. Stallings, the director of the University of Texas at Dallas program, founded in 1996, said it was intended to attract better students, and “was publicity because we don’t have a large football team.”The university now awards about 25 chess scholarships, Mr. Stallings said, but he added that not every member of the chess team had one.Nelson M. Lopez II, a freshman from North Carolina who won the 2006 national high school championship, said he applied to the university because of the strong team. “It was a real big deal,” said Mr. Lopez, who does not have a chess scholarship but instead has a full academic scholarship.The financial value of a chess scholarship is often substantial. At Texas Tech, for example, for out-of-state or foreign residents, the scholarship covers about 75 percent of tuition; for in-state students, it covers 25 percent.Scholarship winners generally come to the notice of universities by playing in chess tournaments nationwide or even worldwide. The University of Connecticut’s engineering school in Storrs, for example, awarded its scholarships, which are for four years, to the top three finishers in a tournament on campus in September. The institution plans to hold another tournament in October to offer three more scholarships.But chess scholarships have not met with success at every institution. Morehead State University in Kentucky offered such scholarships for two or three years but discontinued them this year, said Carol Becker, director of financial aid. She said officials decided that having a separate scholarship for chess players made no sense.“We don’t have a chess team or a chess club, and we concluded that someone who played chess would probably have the analytical skills to qualify for our institutional scholarships,” Ms. Becker said.In the end, she said, “We weren’t really getting a lot of bang for the buck.”'"
"'06-12-27,'1','Tyson Foods has cut the pay of its chairman, John Tyson, and chief executive, Richard L. Bond, by withholding bonuses after the company suffered its first yearly loss since 1994.John Tyson, 53, who stepped down as chief executive in May after serving in that position since 2001, was paid $2.13 million for the year ended Sept. 30. That is a decrease of 62 percent from the previous year when the company had net income of $372 million and Mr. Tyson received a $3.24 million bonus.The pay of Mr. Bond was cut 68 percent, to $1.88 million, according to a company filing yesterday with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Mr. Bond received a $1.38 million bonus in fiscal 2005.A Tyson spokesman, Gary Mickelson, was not available to comment.Tyson Foods, a meat-packing company based in Springdale, Ark., reported a net loss of $196 million for the fiscal year ended Sept. 30, its first annual loss in 12 years. The company cited lower chicken and beef prices stemming from a glut of meat caused by concerns about avian flu and export bans related to mad cow disease.Mr. Bond, 59, said in November that Tyson would be profitable in fiscal 2007.The pay of Mr. Tyson for fiscal 2006 included $1.17 million in salary, $323,659 worth of personal use of company aircraft, $203,536 in taxes paid by the company, and $57,359 in insurance premium reimbursements.The salary of Mr. Bond was $1.14 million and his compensation included $244,587 worth of company aircraft time and $169,072 in compensation from the company for payment of taxes.Mr. Tyson was also granted options to buy 500,000 shares of Tyson Foods at an exercise price of $16.35 a share. Bloomberg values the options at $2.83 million as of the grant date of Nov. 16, 2005, using the Black-Scholes pricing formula, a 10-year term and a stock-volatility rate of 35.8 percent. Mr. Bond was granted options to buy 280,000 shares of Tyson, which Bloomberg values at $1.59 million.'"
"'06-12-27,'1','In short order, Mr. Booth opened commission meetings, subpoenaed data on the racial composition of corporations, unions, and restaurant and hotel chains, and went after the taxi industry as well as landlords who redlined members of minority groups in the sale or rental of housing. He also established commission field offices around the city to take complaints and begin investigations.He found no black principals in the city’s 90 high schools, and only four among 830 other public schools. He discovered that retailers with progressive attitudes and those openly hostile to hiring blacks had virtually the same number of black workers, mostly in the lowest, poorest-paid jobs. He charged that the police routinely assigned demoted officers to beats in Harlem, and he insisted that officers who belonged to the right-wing John Birch Society not be assigned to civil rights demonstrations.Backed by the mayor, Mr. Booth held hearings, filed lawsuits, issued cease-and-desist orders and threatened to cut off the city contracts of companies that violated discrimination laws.Mr. Booth — tall, trim, and a rapid talker with graying hair and a suit often soaked with sweat from his whirlwind pace — also made nocturnal forays to check on, and order the arrest of, cabbies who refused to pick up black people. And he accompanied Mayor Lindsay into tense black communities, talking to the people and calming crowds after racial clashes and volatile incidents, like the sniper shooting of an 11-year-old black boy in East New York, Brooklyn, in July 1966.His support for Stokely Carmichael of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee and other advocates of black power drew sharp criticism, and a rabbi resigned as a member of the rights commission, accusing the chairman of ignoring bias against Jews, a charge Mr. Booth denied.Critics generally gave Mr. Booth high marks for setting an ambitious agenda during his tenure and for putting some punch into what had been a phlegmatic agency, although biases against women and gay people had not yet become a major focus of the commission, and its progress against the mountain of racial discrimination was, at best, incremental.In 1969, Mr. Lindsay named Mr. Booth to a Criminal Court judgeship, which he held for seven years, and from 1976 to 1982 he was an acting justice of State Supreme Court in Brooklyn. In 1987, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo named Mr. Booth to a task force on bias-related violence. In 1991, Mayor David N. Dinkins appointed him chairman of the watchdog Board of Correction, and he later clashed with the Giuliani administration over budget cuts and conditions in city jails.“He exemplified the best of the human spirit,” said Helen Marshall, the Queens borough president. “His passion for justice marked his long career of public service.”William Henry Booth was born in Queens on Aug. 13, 1922. He became president of the Jamaica youth chapter of the N.A.A.C.P. at 16, graduated from Jamaica High School and enrolled in Queens College. After World War II service as an Army Air Force master sergeant in Italy, he resumed his studies and graduated from Queens in 1946. He earned a law degree and a master’s in law from New York University.While practicing criminal law for many years, he continued his civil rights work with the N.A.A.C.P., rising to leadership of the state’s 61 chapters and 55,000 members. He traveled to Mississippi, Alabama and elsewhere in the South to investigate discrimination cases, and joined the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., Bayard Rustin and other black leaders in marches and other civil rights activities.Mr. Booth also joined New York demonstrations, and in 1963 he was one of 24 pickets arrested at Rochdale Village, a Queens cooperative, for blocking trucks at a construction site to demand the hiring of black workers. The charges of disorderly conduct were later dismissed.Besides his daughter, of Sag Harbor, N.Y., Mr. Booth is survived by his second wife, the former Suzanne Bishop, whom he married in 1981; two stepsons, Jeffrey Booth of Kissimmee and Ronald Booth of New York City; a brother, Dr. Clayburn Carter Booth, of Niagara Falls, N.Y.; two grandchildren; and one great-grandchild. His first wife, Harriet Walker Booth, whom he married in 1946, died in 1998.'"
"'06-12-27,'1','BOSTON, Dec. 26 (Reuters) — Telik, a biotechnology company, said Tuesday that a cancer treatment in the experimental stage failed to improve survival in patients with advanced lung cancer or in patients with ovarian cancer, setting off a 70 percent decline in its share price.The company said a late-stage trial of the drug, Telcyta, did not significantly improve survival in patients with advanced lung cancer who had failed other treatments, which was the main goal of the trial.Telcyta, which was in the third and final stage of testing needed for federal approval, was the most advanced of Telik’s drugs.The company, which is based in Palo Alto, Calif., said a Phase III trial of patients with resistant ovarian cancer also failed the trial’s main goal of demonstrating significant improvement in survival.“These results are extremely disappointing,” Michael M.

"'06-12-27,'1','Refco Inc., the onetime futures and commodities broker, said yesterday that it had emerged from bankruptcy protection, a move that will allow the company to wind up its businesses.Refco and 23 affiliates filed for court protection on Oct. 17, 2005, a week after revealing that the former chief executive, Phillip R. Bennett, had hidden $430 million of debt, and two months after raising $583 million in an initial public offering.Mr. Bennett has pleaded not guilty to fraud charges and is scheduled to stand trial in March.The expected payouts represent a small fraction of the $16.8 billion that creditors claimed they were owed. Judge Robert D. Drain of Federal Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan approved Refco’s reorganization plan on Dec. 15.Under the plan, secured lenders who were owed $717.7 million were paid in full, while bondholders were expected to receive 83.4 cents on the dollar, Refco said.Customers of the Refco Capital Markets broker-dealer unit would receive 85.6 cents on the dollar, and the unit’s unsecured creditors would receive 37.6 cents on the dollar, Refco said.Unsecured creditors of other units would receive 23 cents to 37.6 cents on the dollar, the company said. A litigation trust set up to sue individuals who may have contributed to any fraud could also obtain recoveries for stockholders and some creditors.Marc Kirschner, the court-appointed trustee for Refco Capital Markets, expects to make substantial payouts to the unit’s creditors by year’s end, Refco said.'"
"'06-12-27,'1','LOUISVILLE, Ky., Dec. 26 (AP) — Galen Martin, a civil rights activist and human rights official in Kentucky, died Dec. 19. He was 79.The cause was complications of injuries suffered in a cycling accident three years ago, a daughter-in-law, Rhonda Martin, said.Mr. Martin, executive director of the Kentucky Commission on Human Rights from 1963 to 1989, was instrumental in the drafting and passage of a state civil rights law in 1966. The law prohibits discrimination in employment and public places because of race, color, religion or national origin.In 1972, Mr. Martin was a lawyer for plaintiffs who sued the Louisville and Jefferson County school systems to desegregate. He also helped draft the desegregation plan that resulted from the lawsuit.He was executive director of the Fair Housing Council in Louisville in 2003, when he hit his head while riding a mountain bike on a forest trail near Damascus, Va.'"
"'06-12-27,'1','MOSCOW, Dec. 26 — Gazprom, the Russian energy monopoly, threatened Tuesday to halt natural gas supplies to Belarus if that country did not agree to a large price increase by the first of the year.The strong Russian position suggests that Moscow is becoming aggressive in energy pricing even with countries that have been close allies.Belarus now has the cheapest gas in the former Soviet Union, other than Russia. Gazprom, the world’s largest energy company by volume of reserves, is insisting that Belarus pay more than double its current price, though it would still pay less than richer countries in Europe.Gazprom warned that Belarus was behaving “irresponsibly” in the talks over pricing and a Russian demand to surrender equity in an important export pipeline, and said that such resistance was putting Belarus’s energy supply at risk.The threat was issued almost a year after Gazprom cut off fuel supplies to Ukraine, another important transit country for Russian energy exports, causing intense concern over supply in Western Europe. After three days and a din of criticism, Gazprom turned the gas back on.'"
"'06-12-27,'1','Evan Julber admits that his first home swap was a leap of faith. He traded his house in Bend, Ore., for a stay at a home in Guadeloupe, a French island in the Caribbean. “They didn’t speak much English and we didn’t speak any French,” he said. “And it was all done with a handshake, an email handshake.”The trip turned out to be problem-free. Mr. Julber was hooked on the concept. Subsequently, when he and his wife, Patricia, thought about buying a second home, they had one aim: Buy something swappable.Home exchanges are hardly a new concept, but swapping vacation homes is gaining momentum. Services like Digsville Home Exchange Club (www.digsville.com) and HomeExchange.com report that about 20 percent of their listings are now second homes, with HomeExchange.com posting 5,500 listings in the United States and 1,400 in France alone. Another site, HomeLink International (www.homelink.org) has a database of homes in 68 countries, from apartments in Budapest to an ocean-view house in Tahiti. And unlike swapping a primary home, owners do not have to trade at the same time. Additionally, second homes are usually set up with fewer personal items and valuables than a primary home, especially if they also serve as rentals.The key to a successful vacation-home swap lies in the way owners promote their homes to potential swappers. “You are marketing your home, your neighborhood, and you are marketing yourself,” said Ed Kushins, the president of HomeExcange.com. A listing should describe not only the house or condo, but also the neighborhood and nearby amenities, as well as the basic house rules, including any rooms or items that may be off limits to visitors. The listing should also include multiple photos, Mr. Kushins said.“It’s personal,” he said. “It’s not only what the house is like but what you are like.”Home descriptions at Digsville, which charges $44.95 to list a house, say not only whether there is a stroller or high chair available but also if there is a home office and wireless Internet access. Owners can also list their favorite local restaurants and coffee houses and describe their level of housekeeping standards.'"

"'06-12-28,'0','“At the end of the day, F.D.A. is looking out for a few cloning companies and not for consumers or the dairy industry,” said Joseph Mendelson, legal director for the Center for Food Safety, an advocacy group. He also said the agency had announced its policy during the holiday week to minimize consumer backlash.Opponents hope to derail the policy before it becomes final, in part through congressional pressure.Along with six other senators, Patrick Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, had written a Dec. 11 letter to the Health and Human Services Secretary Michael Leavitt, who oversees the F.D.A., calling for a more rigorous and public approval process before cloned animals are allowed into the food supply.Today, Mr. Leahy again called for a “careful, deliberative and open process.”The F.D.A.’s finding comes more than three years after the agency first gave a tentative approval to cloned animals for food but retreated after its own advisory panel found there was insufficient scientific backing for that conclusion.This time, F.D.A. officials said they had substantial new data, which they presented in a nearly 700-page “draft risk assessment” that was made public today.The assessment concluded that milk and meat from cloned cows, pigs and goats is virtually indistinguishable from conventional milk and meat and is “as safe to eat as the food we eat every day,” Stephen F. Sundlof, the F.D.A.’s chief of veterinary medicine, said in a telephone news conference with reporters.He said it was not likely that food from cloned animals would have to be labeled as such, though a final decision has not been made.While animal cloning has always been legal, since 2001 there has been a voluntary moratorium on the selling of milk or meat from such animals. The F.D.A. had requested that moratorium to give it time to study the issue.The moratorium will stay in place until the new policy is finalized, following a 90-day period for public comment and additional time for the F.D.A. to review the comments. Mr. Sundlof said he could not say when the final policy would be ready, though it might be by the end of 2007. Even then, the moratorium would remain for products from sheep, the F.D.A. said, because there was not enough evidence of their safety.The finding was hailed by cloning companies, which have been struggling to build a business, and by some farmers and breeders who have already made clones of their prized livestock but have had to pour milk down the drain and keep their meat off the market.A poll earlier this month from the Pew Initiative for Food and Biotechnology found that while most consumers know little about animal cloning, 64 percent said they were uncomfortable with it, with 46 percent saying they were “strongly uncomfortable.”The F.D.A. said that by law it could consider only the scientific aspects, not consumer demand or the ethics of cloning.The dairy industry has also expressed concern. A survey conducted last summer by the International Dairy Foods Association, an industry trade group, found that 14 percent of women would turn away from all dairy products if milk from clones was introduced into the food supply.F.D.A. officials said no other country had yet approved food from cloned livestock, though some are considering it. That raised the prospect that American exports of milk or meat could be blocked by certain countries if they contain products from cloned animals.Carol Tucker Foreman, director for food policy at the Consumer Federation of America, said consumer groups would also ask food companies, retailers and restaurant chains to disavow use of products from cloned livestock.That raises the possibility that some food companies will label their products as “clone-free,” just as some now label milk as not being from cows injected with growth hormone. George Siemon, chief executive of Organic Valley, a Wisconsin-based cooperative that primarily sells organic dairy products, said he believed the federal government’s organic rules would preclude use of milk from cloned cows but that in any event, organic producers would shun it.Cloning involves putting an animal’s DNA into an egg that has had its own DNA removed. The resulting embryo, after being implanted into a surrogate mother, makes a genetically identical copy of the original animal.Since Dolly the sheep was cloned in 1996, scientists have successfully cloned horses, cows, pigs, goats and a variety of other animals, though not chickens or other poultry.But even if two animals have identical genes, they can turn out differently if those genes are turned on or off at different times. And studies have shown that embryos created by cloning are different from embryos created by the fusing of sperm and egg in their patterns of gene activity.These differences are presumed to account in large measure for the low success rate of cloning. Fetuses can grow unusually large, posing a risk to the surrogate mother. Many clones die during gestation or shortly after birth. Some are born with deformed heads or limbs or problems with their hearts, lungs or other organs.But the agency concluded that such differences in genetic activity would not pose a risk to consumers, provided obviously sick and deformed animals were kept out of the food supply, as is now done anyway. It said that clones that survive past the first few days “appear to grow and develop normally” and that healthy adult clones are “virtually indistinguishable” from non-cloned livestock.The draft assessment based its conclusions in part on studies, some done by cloning companies, comparing the composition of the milk, meat and blood of cloned animals and conventional animals.Mr. Sundlof said the agency also found that cloning “poses no unique risks to the health of animals” beyond those seen with other forms of assisted reproduction such as in vitro fertilization. The frequency of problems is higher with cloning, however, perhaps because it is a newer technology.The F.D.A. announcement, by paving the way for the end of the moratorium, could make it easier to convince farmers and breeders to pay up to $15,000 to have a prized bull or dairy cow copied.“I think that this draft is going to provide the industry the comfort it needs,” said Mark Walton, president of ViaGen, a cloning company based in Austin, Tex., that has yet to turn a profit after five years.Because cloning is expensive, the food in question would primarily come from the offspring of the cloned animals, which would not be produced by cloning. The F.D.A. said milk and meat from such offspring is safe, and that any abnormalities in clones do not carry into the next generation.Bob Schauf, a Holstein breeder and dairy farmer in Barron, Wis., said the F.D.A. finding “just sort of lifts the stigma of the clones.”Mr. Schauf had two of his prized dairy cows cloned in order to sell their offspring. Unable to sell the milk from those clones, his family and the families of his employees have been drinking it themselves.“It’s kind of a shame to have to dump the milk, knowing the milk is fine,” he said.Donald P. Coover, a veterinarian and rancher in Galesburg, Kan., said products from clones and their offspring have already entered the food supply despite the voluntary moratorium. He said he had sold thousands of straws of semen from cloned bulls to other farmers to use in artificial insemination.“I think it would be incredibly naïve to suggest that all these animals that have been produced are standing around someplace waiting for a green light from the F.D.A.” he said.The F.D.A.’s assessment did not include genetically modified animals, in which a new gene is introduced. The F.D.A. is still considering whether to allow such animals into the food supply and will decide on those on a case by case basis.'"
"'06-12-28,'0','Apple Computer shares rebounded yesterday as investors discounted the possibility that its chief executive, Steven P. Jobs, might be implicated in an investigation of the company’s stock option grants.Shares of Apple, based in Cupertino, Calif., closed 1 cent higher at $81.52 in Nasdaq trading, after plunging earlier by as much as 5.8 percent.The shares fell after a legal newspaper reported that federal prosecutors were examining whether company officials falsified documents to inflate the value of options. Several analysts issued reports yesterday saying the news would have no impact on Apple or Mr. Jobs. A report of a 413 percent rise in Christmas traffic at Apple’s iTunes store may also have helped the stock.“There was a realization that it will take an awful lot to remove Steve Jobs from office and people saw the drop as a buying opportunity,” said Rob Enderle, an analyst with the research firm Enderle Group in San Jose, Calif.The falsified documents were uncovered by Apple during an internal inquiry that concluded in October, The Recorder newspaper said on its Web site yesterday, citing unnamed sources. The information was passed on to the United States attorney’s office, according to The Recorder, which is based in San Francisco.'"
"'06-12-28,'0','These illnesses are the tragic consequences of the national penchant in Japan for turning things cute and cuddly into social status symbols. But they also reflect the fondness for piling onto fads in Japan, a nation that always seems caught in the grip of some trend or other.“Japanese are maniacs for booms,” said Toshiaki Kageyama, a professor of veterinary medicine specializing in genetic defects at Azabu University in Sagamihara. “But people forget here that dogs aren’t just status symbols. They are living things.”Dogs are just one current rage. Less consequential is the big boom in the color pink: pink digital cameras, pink portable game consoles and, yes, pink laptop computers have become must-haves for young women. Last year, it was “bug king,” a computer game with battling beetles.A number of the booms in Japan, including Tamagotchi — basically a virtual pet that grew on a computer screen — and the fanciful cartoon characters of Pokémon, have made their way across the Pacific and swept up American children, too.The affection for fads in Japan reflects its group-oriented culture, a product of the conformity taught in its grueling education system. But booms also take off because they are fueled by big business. Companies like Sony and Nintendo are constantly looking to create the next adorable hit, churning out cute new characters and devices. Booms help sustain an entire industrial complex, from software makers to marketers and distributors, that thrives off the pack mentality of consumers in Japan.The same thing is happening in Japan’s fast-growing pet industry, estimated at more than $10 billion a year. Chihuahuas are the current hot breed, after one starred in the television ads of a finance company. In the early 1990s, a TV drama featuring a Siberian husky helped send annual sales rocketing from just a few hundred dogs to 60,000; sales fell when the fad cooled, according to the Japan Kennel Club. The breed took off despite being inappropriately large for cramped homes in Japan.The United States also experiences surges in sales of certain breeds, and some states have confronted “puppy mills” that churn out popular breeds by enacting “puppy lemon laws” that prevent breeders from selling diseased animals.But in Japan, the sales spikes are far more extreme, statistics show. The kennel club says unethical breeders try to cash in on the booms, churning out large volumes of puppies from a small number of parents. While many breeders have stuck to healthy mating practices, the lure of profits has attracted less scrupulous breeders and led to proliferation of puppy mills.Some veterinarians and other experts cite another, less obvious factor behind widespread risky inbreeding in Japan’s dog industry — the nation’s declining birthrate.As the number of childless women and couples in Japan has increased, so has the number of dogs, which are being coddled and doted upon in place of children, experts say. In the last decade, the number of pet dogs in Japan has doubled to 13 million last year — outnumbering children under 12 — according to Takashi Harada, president of Yaseisha, a publisher of pet industry magazines.“Households with few or no children are turning to dogs to fill the void,” he said. “For a dog to be part of the family, it has to be unique and have character, like a person.”Indeed, many of these buyers want dogs they can show off like proud parents. They are willing to pay top yen, with rarer dogs fetching higher prices. Coveted traits like a blue-tinged coat are often the result of recessive genes, which can determine appearance only when combined with another recessive gene.Inbreeding is a quick way to bring out recessive traits, as dogs carrying the gene are repeatedly mated with their own offspring, enhancing the trait over successive generations.When done carefully, some types of inbreeding are safe. But in Japan, all too many breeders throw aside caution in search of a quick profit, experts in the business say. In these cases, for every dog born with prized colors, many more appear with defects, also the product of recessive genes.“The demand is intense, and so is the temptation,” said Hidekazu Kawanabe, one of the country’s top Chihuahua breeders. “There are a lot of bad breeders out there who see dogs as nothing more than an industrial product to make quick money.”Awareness is so recent that the only comprehensive survey of genetic defects came out two years ago, looking at malformed hips in Labrador retrievers. The results showed that nearly half of all Labradors suffered from the deformity — four times more than the United States, according to Professor Kageyama at Azabu University, who conducted the survey.Hirofumi Sasaki, a pet store owner in the western city of Hiroshima, has seen so many defective dogs that last year he converted an old bar into a hospice to care for them. So far he has taken in 32 dogs, though only 12 have survived.One is Keika, a deaf 1-year-old female dachshund with eyes that wander aimlessly. Her breeder was originally selling her for about $7,500 because she is half-white, a rare trait in dachshunds.“That is an unnatural color, like a person with blue skin,” Mr. Sasaki said.The breeder told Mr. Sasaki that he had bred a dog with three generations of offspring — in human terms, first with its daughter, then a granddaughter and then a great-granddaughter — until Keika was born. The other four puppies in the litter were so hideously deformed that they were killed right after birth.Ms. Miyauchi, the Boston terrier owner and a resident of the western city of Kobe, said she was appalled to learn how common inbreeding was in Japan. After the death of her second Boston terrier, she said she went looking for the breeder, but the phone number she got from the pet shop was invalid.“No one’s really monitoring the industry,” she said.The government concedes that oversight is poor, and passed a law in June to revoke the licenses of breeders who use dogs with genetic defects for breeding. But the Environment Ministry, which has jurisdiction over pets, says it has just four officials to monitor all of 25,000 pet shops, kennels and breeders in Japan.The Japan Kennel Club began adding results of DNA screening onto pedigree certificates in April. But that falls short of the American Kennel Club, which discourages risky inbreeding by listing acceptable colors for each breed.“Japan is about 30 or 40 years behind in dealing with genetic defects,” said Takemi Nagamura, president of the Japan Kennel Club.Ultimately, animal care professionals say, the solution is educating not just breeders but potential dog owners.“If consumers didn’t buy these unnatural dogs,” said Chizuko Yamaguchi, a veterinarian at the Japan Animal Welfare Society, “breeders wouldn’t breed them.”'"
"'06-12-28,'0','Carbon trading is common in Europe and parts of Asia, where many countries operate under the Kyoto Protocol, the international pact regulating greenhouse gas emissions, which is set to expire in 2012. The United States has refused to join.Most of the countries operate under a “cap and trade” system in which nations allot companies the right to emit a set amount of greenhouse gases. Companies that emit less than allowed, or that build new clean-burning plants, get credits they can then sell to companies that need them to meet the standard because they are emitting more than their allowable amount.For now, trading in the United States is voluntary: 225 companies that have made promises to reduce greenhouse gases by 6 percent by 2010 are trading carbon credits on the Chicago Climate Exchange. Prices for the credits started around 90 cents per ton of carbon when the exchange was established in 2002; they now trade around $4.Most experts said trading would pick up in California, which has passed greenhouse gas rules (they are being challenged in court), and in the Northeast, where a coalition of states are following California’s lead. But once national rules pass, as many experts predict, the market is expected to explode.“This cottage industry has the potential to become one of the largest commodity markets in the world,” said Emma Stewart, director of research and development at Business for Social Responsibility, a nonprofit consulting and research organization.For utilities and manufacturers, the ability to trade credits could take some of the sting out of regulation. “There is more certainty that we will be living in a carbon-constrained world through some sort of legislative activity, and that helps carbon take on a value,” said Sara S. Kendall, vice president for environment, health and safety for Weyerhaeuser, the forest products company.That value, in turn, makes it easier to persuade shareholders and directors that it makes sense to invest in research on ways to cut emissions even beyond a mandatory level.“A market-based trading approach fosters innovation,” said Edwin L. Mongan III, director of energy and environment at DuPont, one of the exchange’s 14 founders. “It gives an incentive to use your best technology to get well below the mandatory targets.”But while utilities and manufacturers worry about abating the costs of new rules, financial firms are already figuring out the best ways to profit from them.Natsource, a green-oriented investment firm, has begun hiring environmental economists and regulatory experts to help “figure out what the regulatory regime will look like, and what sort of abatement projects will make sense from an investment standpoint,” said Jack D. Cogen, its chief executive.GE Energy Financial Services is already negotiating to invest in projects that keep methane from escaping from landfills and coal mines, and it will take ownership of many of the resulting carbon credits. There are only a few deals in the pipeline now, said Kevin Walsh, the unit’s managing director, “but we want to get in, learn and have a few deals under our belt when regulation comes to the U.S.”Insurance companies and consulting firms see the potential for profit, too. Marsh, which is in both those businesses, is helping clients assess the risks and potential rewards of carbon abatement projects. Marsh, a unit of Marsh & McLennan, is also creating new insurance products that mitigate the risk of a project going awry — say, a forest that burns down, or a carbon leak at a coal-burning plant.“The U.S. market for carbon credits will be huge,” said Gary S. Guzy, a senior vice president at Marsh, “and we want to be leading the risk management and services side of it.”For many companies, though, the motivation has less to do with the potential for profit. American Electric Power, one of the climate exchange’s 14 founders, joined partly to influence national policy and partly to “get carbon prices embedded in our own people’s thought processes,” said Bruce H. Braine, vice president of strategic policy analysis.Once emissions rules are in place, he said, it may make more economic sense to earn carbon credits by planting a forest or capturing methane from agricultural holding ponds than to cut emissions by switching a carbon-spewing coal plant to natural gas. Conversely, carbon credits can add to the economic viability of converting coal to gas, efficient turbine components and other clean technologies with high upfront costs.The Chicago exchange is being watched for early signs of glitches in its trading systems so those glitches can be ironed out before mandatory emissions rules make trading more a matter of profit and loss than of choice.“If you shut down an obsolete plant, should you automatically get carbon credits?” asked Matt Cheney, chief executive of MMA Renewable Ventures, which invests in clean energy projects and is a member of the exchange. “And if I put up a wind-powered plant, should you get the carbon credit for buying my clean electricity, or should I for providing it? It is all still very complicated, because we just don’t know what the final U.S. law will say.”In particular, companies are already worrying about how Congress will establish baselines, the emission levels from which mandated reductions will be calculated. In Europe, prices for credits plunged this year because too many credits were issued, producing a glut.“They should have auctioned off emissions allowances in Europe, not just given them away,” said Dan Bakal, director of electric power programs at Ceres, a coalition of environmentalists and investors. He predicts that an auction system will be built into any American regulatory scheme.Nor is there any certainty that the Chicago exchange will end up as the primary trading vehicle for carbon credits. Some experts predict that the Intercontinental Exchange, usually called Ice, will take over. Others suspect that the New York Mercantile Exchange, where energy futures now trade, will be dominant.But for now, Chicago is the only game in town.“I would say within the next year or so we’ll start trading on this market,” said Simon Greenshields, managing director of the Morgan Stanley Capital Group. “We want to gain the experience.”'"

"'06-12-28,'0','In 2004, the most recent year tracked, Americans spent $2.95 billion on yoga classes, yoga-related products like clothing, books and mats, and on yoga retreats and vacations, according to a survey of nearly 4,800 people conducted for Yoga Journal.Yoga has stretched far beyond its meditative, baggy-sweats roots to become a fashionable lifestyle pursuit appealing as much to competitive marathon runners and college students as is does to om-chanting meditators. Curve-hugging styles in Lycra, cotton and microfibers come from a variety of yoga-inspired brands, including Prana, Be Present, Inner Waves, and Lululemon Athletica, as well as Nike and Fila.In a sign of how this niche is gaining mainstream appeal, last year Liz Claiborne bought Prana. Beaver Theodosakis and his wife, Pam, founded Prana 13 years ago in their garage in Carlsbad, Calif. They said they wanted to design flexible and stylish clothes for yoga practitioners and rock climbers. Prana’s sales had reached $30 million by the time Liz Claiborne bought it, according to Mr. Theodosakis. Neither company disclosed the purchase price.“No doubt yoga for us is the biggest part of the visibility of our brand,” Mr. Theodosakis said in a phone interview from the company’s headquarters in Vista, Calif.Little has changed since Liz Claiborne bought Prana, except that Prana now can reach more shoppers and suppliers worldwide. At 2:45 p.m. every day, a Chinese gong still reverberates through the 40,000-square-foot office building, jolting employees into a “mandatory one-minute meditation.” At the end of every day, employees gather (voluntarily) on the roof overlooking the Pacific for a yoga class taught by Mr. Theodosakis.Lululemon Athletica, a professed “yoga-inspired athletic apparel company” based in Vancouver, British Columbia, this year hired a former chief executive of Reebok, Robert Meers, to run the company. Lululemon is expanding in Japan and especially in the United States, where the company operates 10 stores and plans to open 30 next year and eventually 200, Mr. Meers said.The global reach of yoga is also reflected in the recent outcropping of new yoga studios and studio chains like Pure Yoga in Hong Kong. Riding that momentum is Yoga Journal magazine, which is now published in Russia, Spain, Italy and Thailand, and next year will add Hong Kong and Brazil.“Yoga has moved into a much broader marketplace,” said Bill Harper, publisher of Yoga Journal. “So many people are introducing products for the space, and they’re all rising with the tide.”Increasingly, major corporations outside the athletics and mind-body arenas are aiming their advertisements at this lucrative market. Prudential Financial, for instance, is running a “Live Long Live Well” campaign. A svelte woman in her 60s stretches in a triangle pose in the ads. “Yoga personifies the idea of health, and we’ve been making a concerted effort to tie well-being into finances,” said Maria Umbach, a vice president for marketing in Prudential’s life insurance unit.Ford Motor sought young and fit career women this year in its “Live and Drive” ad campaign for its $18,000 Fusion car. The ads featured a woman in her 20s taking a yoga class in which she is straining to lift her body vertically into an arm-stand pose that other students around her are holding perfectly.“This woman is in the target audience. Yoga is very popular for that age group,” said Elizabeth Boone, group account director at JWT, the unit of WPP Group that created the ads for Ford. Ms. Boone has not overlooked that yoga is growing fastest within the 18-to-24-year-old group.Jewelry designers are also tailoring their products to serve this burgeoning niche. Sonja Picard, a Canadian designer, for instance, inscribes ancient Vedic sutras in some of her silver necklaces and bracelets. Price tags for these added touches can be heaven-high.“We do charge more for the research,” said Heather Askinose, a co-founder of Energy Muse Jewelry, whose tagline is “activating jewelry through intention.” Ms. Askinose and her business partner, Timmi Jandro, promise their customers that each jewelry piece is strung by a Vietnamese family in Los Angeles. It is also “cleansed” of all human contact and energy for 48 hours in a room where it is “vibrationally aligned with music” before being wrapped in a cotton pouch. Each necklace comes with a message, or “intention” — confidence, tranquillity, happiness, performance, and so on.Energy Muse Jewelry, which is based in Torrance, Calif., also attracts celebrity endorsers, including Hollywood’s favorite guru, Deepak Chopra; the inspirational speaker and author Anthony Robbins; and the Los Angeles Lakers coach Phil Jackson.Back at the yoga conference, Angie Amburgey selected a carnelian and turquoise necklace at the crowded Energy Muse kiosk. She said she was drawn to its “voice” message and its elegance.“I can’t believe I paid $100 for this necklace,” said Ms. Amburgey, 32, a marketing professional from Columbus, Ohio, while rubbing the Chinese coin pendant on her necklace. “It’s brilliant marketing, isn’t it? I should know. But they said it’ll help me with expression issues. Besides, I’m on vacation.”'"
"'06-12-28,'0','The administration says two dozen utility plants and three chemical plants have switched to technology that reduces or eliminates the use of the most dangerous chemicals.These are results that Mr. Corzine calls encouraging, especially given the state’s limited ability to regulate railways. He has also proposed more training programs and background checks for chemical employees, as well as terror preparation drills. And he said that he might double the number of companies subject to the strictest regulations, which now includes 45 plants.“We’ve taken a whole series of steps,” Mr. Corzine said in a recent interview, “from simplistic things like walls and perimeter security in the places of highest concentration of chemicals, to a greater understanding of what’s in parked rail cars and greater cooperation in storing and moving of the rail cars. What we’re doing is very close to what we wanted to do right from the beginning.”Mr. Corzine’s approach to domestic security illustrates a basic reality of government: sweeping changes are sometimes easier to propose as a legislator in the minority party than to carry out as an executive in power.As the nation scrambled to fend off possible terrorist attacks in the wake of the 9/11 attacks, Mr. Corzine quickly emerged as a leading advocate on chemical security. Coming from a state with so many chemical plants — the F.B.I. called one stretch in New Jersey “the most dangerous two miles in America” — Mr. Corzine argued that voluntary efforts by industry and stronger perimeter security at plants were not enough. He wanted government to push manufacturers to switch to “inherently safer technology” and to eliminate the use of toxic chemicals wherever feasible.That aggressive stance won him praise in Washington, even though legislation championed by Mr. Corzine, a Democrat, stood little chance of becoming law at a time when Republicans controlled Congress and the White House. In his state, the chemical lobby posted billboards along the New Jersey Turnpike reminding residents of the jobs in the industry, conservative editorials called Mr. Corzine a radical environmentalist, and some business groups questioned his patriotism.Hal Bozarth, executive director of the Chemical Industry Council of New Jersey, said that when Mr. Corzine was sworn in as governor last January, industry officials greeted him with a reminder that companies across the state had already spent more than $100 million on security — and with a promise of cooperation.During much of Mr. Corzine’s first year in office, that cooperation has centered on following up on an initiative started by his predecessor, Acting Gov. Richard J. Codey, who mandated that all chemical companies identify what safer processes might be available in their industry.Elaine Makatura, a spokeswoman for the State Department of Environmental Protection, said inspectors have found that virtually every company has completed its safety plan. She said the state expected to issue its report on the issue early next year, several months after initially promised.But those rules do not require the companies to adopt the safer processes if they deem them too expensive. And chemical safety advocates, like Rick Engler of the Work Environment Council, say it is often hard to know how much progress has been made because the state has been unwilling to release much information.State environmental officials have acknowledged that many of the state’s most dangerous plants continue to use and store stockpiles of toxic chemicals near major population centers. That would include the chlorine plant in Kearny, in Hudson County, only about 10 miles from Midtown Manhattan, which Mr. Corzine toured with the “60 Minutes” crew.Richard Cañas, director of the New Jersey Office of Homeland Security and Preparedness, said the Corzine administration has had difficulty convincing businesses that switching to safer technology is worth the price, which can run into tens of millions of dollars at a single plant. “To the extent that replacing technology is going to break the bank, they’re not willing to go that far,” Mr. Cañas said. “It’s always money that impedes what you’d like to do.”Dealing with the railroads has been an even trickier challenge for the administration because the railways are regulated by the federal government. Mr. Corzine said state regulators have had discussions with railroad executives, who have agreed to use more decoy cars, store fewer toxic chemicals on unguarded railway sidings and keep closer track of chemicals throughout the shipping process.The state is also considering building a 10-foot fence along a 2.6-mile stretch of the turnpike to shield the railway siding from autos and potential terrorists on the roadway. But Mr. Cañas said that the $6 million fence might not be necessary if the railroads follow through on their pledge not to store the tanker cars full of potentially dangerous gases near the highway.Though Governor Corzine is now entrenched in Trenton, he once again finds himself lobbying Congress for stricter regulations on the rail shipment of toxic chemicals. He has also urged the federal government not to override New Jersey’s tougher chemical security measures if Congress enacts a new law on the issue.But the governor said that he did not believe it was necessary to further strengthen state laws by mandating a switch to safer technology.“I think people in the industry are worried that if we don’t get results we may use the super hammer,” he said, referring to such a mandate. “So we’ve gotten much better response because we’ve done this in a sensible, realistic manner.”'"

"'06-12-28,'0','Even more baffling than why Mr. Todd would not play to one of his strengths is who his intended customer is. (The store was practically empty on the three occasions I visited before the holidays.)The ladies who lunch would be shocked — shocked! — at the X-rated coffee-table book by the photographer Terry Richardson on display in the front room and confused by the lack of hostess suggestions (a pair of $800 silver salad servers notwithstanding). And a decorator on a budget would blanch at the prices. You know you’re in trouble when there are no price tags in sight.While the prices are not as steep as at nearby Maison Gerard or Karl Kemp, neither is the choice as impressive. There is a little too much B.B.F. (boring brown furniture) and not enough substance for decorators or serious furniture buyers, certainly not when Mr. Todd is charging prices similar to those for collectibles.Which suggests that he intends the store to function as a stockroom for private clients and for anyone with deep pockets looking to buy an off-the-shelf lifestyle. He could do worse. There is no shortage of rich people in Manhattan with either no time or no clue.HARD-CORE collectors may sniff at remodeled antiques, but given the price of fabrics and the hassle involved in having something reupholstered, somebody may as well do the work tastefully and be paid for it. That said, $15,000 is too much for a pair of 18th-century French bergères reworked in turquoise linen.And not even the most style-challenged bonus baby would buy an oversize Lucite lantern for $6,000. (Add $1,000 more if you prefer an electrical version to jumbo candles.)Mr. Todd rolls with a well-heeled crowd, including socialites in training wheels, and presumably some of them will become his customers. But does anyone, even the most whimsical It Girl who has everything, really need a seashell-encrusted crucifix ($2,000)?Much more desirable were enormous steel and glass bookcases ($22,500 each) by the Paris-based designer Renaud Vuaillat and an 18th-century sofa reupholstered in red Jansen fabric ($11,000).Also impressive were an elegant 19th-century French cherry-wood desk ($15,000) and a bronze coffee table made from connecting disks, which can be customized (from $8,800, depending on whether you opt for lacquered wood or bronze disks).Except for a handsome pair of 1940s British reading lamps ($8,000 for the two), the lighting for sale looked not unlike what you could find at Simon Pearce and was not the store’s strong point.Unless he wants to appeal only to the rich and clueless and to grandes dames whose idea of slumming it is to buy $8,000 candlestick holders below 14th Street, Mr. Todd would do well to offer some more affordable merchandise.In fact, the cheapest items in the store were mercury glass votive candles at $45. Not ridiculously priced by any means, but similar styles are to be found at Target for under $15.The ikat-print cushions scattered around the store looked appealing enough, but on closer inspection they turned out to be from ABC Carpet & Home and were only for show. Pity, as they are exactly the kind of well-priced accessories Mr. Todd should also be offering the party faithful.'"

In October 2005, she sought a transfer from the boiler mechanic’s job to a position that did not require working in harsh places. She was told she could apply for such jobs when they came open, but could not be automatically transferred.Feeling her situation was an emergency, she approached her union representative to intervene. She also wrote letters to her councilman and to the mayor. All of her inquiries received a similar response.She had no choice but return to her position, and by December 2005, she had a relapse.“I couldn’t breathe,” she said. “I was very sick dealing with the soot.”She went back on medical leave for five months, receiving $250 a month in disability payments from her union. When that stopped, she continued to survive on her income tax refund, close to $7,000 for each of the last two years. When that ran out, she went on on public assistance, which was less than $300 a month.“I wanted to work, but all I knew was boilers,” she said. Without other skills, she felt crippled. By the end of September, her bills were mounting and she was four months behind on the rent, owing close to $2,300, plus a cable and phone bill of about $475.With the stress, she lost sleep. One late night in August, she was searching the Internet and found an ad for training at the Grace Institute, which offers tuition-free business training to disadvantaged women. “It had everything I was looking for,” she said. “My eyes began to well up.”The institute is an affiliate of the Catholic Charities Archdiocese of New York, one of the seven agencies supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund. In September, she began taking classes five days a week, learning administrative skills, including how to type and how to use office software.But she continued to have financial problems. In September, she was 72 hours away from being evicted when she confided in Anne Yackee, a social worker at the institute. “I had no one else to turn to,” Ms. Green said.Ms. Yackee advised Ms. Green to go immediately to housing court. There, Ms. Green informed the judge that $1,874 would be paid from Jiggets, a rent subsidy, and that public assistance was paying the $426 balance. Ms. Yackee also spoke with Elizabeth Savage, the student affairs coordinator, who approached Catholic Charities on Ms. Green’s behalf. With money from the Neediest Cases, Ms. Green was able to pay $475 for the phone.For the past four months, Ms. Green has excelled at the institute. After graduation in February, she hopes to work in an office while continuing her studies to be a respiratory therapist. To keep her focused on her goal, the Neediest Cases money was used to pay $70 for the application fee at Borough of Manhattan Community College. She has applied for a grant that she hopes will cover the tuition.“I am so blessed, I am so blessed, ” she said, referring to all the help she has received.“Everything is changing. I am going to school; I am going to get a great job. I feel so good.”'"

"'06-12-29,'0','The probe revealed curious irregularities in the way Apple granted stock options. For example, there was supposedly a special board meeting in 2001 to approve options grants, but auditors now say that meeting never took place. The S.E.C. filing said that no current members of Apple’s management were aware of the falsified meeting, however.The special committee Apple commissioned to investigate its options awards issued a statement today that was signed by two Apple board members: former vice president Al Gore, who chaired the special committee, and Jerome York, who heads the board’s Audit and Finance Committee. “The board of directors is confident that the company has corrected the problems that led to the restatement, and it has complete confidence in Steve Jobs and the senior management team,” the statement said.Apple, which is known for obsessively guarding information about new products, appears to have applied the same secrecy to its handling of the stock option issues. Before today’s filing, it had confined its public response to a few terse statements. This week it continued to maintain its silence as reports about possible falsified documents rattled shareholders.“What we want a company to do is to get good information in the marketplace as soon as it has that information,” said Patrick McGurn, executive vice president of Institutional Shareholder Services, which advises its clients on corporate governance issues, before Apple made today’s announcement. “Obviously the information has dribbled in fits and starts out of Apple. It has been more of a piecemeal approach.”“Apple is in a much more difficult position than other companies in the backdating morass, because a significant portion of its market valuation is based on Steve Jobs staying at his job,” he said.The company had said previously said that Mr. Jobs knew of some backdated grants, but that he did not knowingly receive any of them and had not benefited from the practice.Apple’s auditor, KPMG, has been trying to avoid controversy since it reached a deferred-prosecution agreement with the Justice Department last year in a case involving illegal tax shelters. Analysts said that would lead the firm to be particularly vigilant in its auditing of options cases.The options issues at Apple, which the company first disclosed in June, came back into the spotlight this week when The Recorder, a San Francisco newspaper owned by American Lawyer Media, reported that the investigation conducted by a law firm on Apple’s behalf had found that options documents had been falsified to increase the value of grants to Apple executives.On Thursday, The Financial Times reported that investigators had discovered an options grant to Mr. Jobs that had not been properly authorized by the company’s board.After the review of its options accounting practices, Apple said in October that while there had been 15 instances of backdating, the review had found no misconduct by any member of Apple’s current management team.The language of Apple’s statement, coupled with the simultaneous resignation from the board of Fred D. Anderson, the company’s former chief financial officer, led analysts to believe that Apple and Mr. Jobs were attempting to distance themselves from any blame in the case.Analysts have also focused on the possible role of Nancy Heinen, Apple’s former general counsel, in the options grants. Ms. Heinen left the company without a public announcement in May and declined to comment on the reason for her departure.Today’s filing revealed that Apple’s investigation “raised serious concerns” about two former company officers, but it did not name names.Both Ms. Heinen and Mr. Anderson have retained their own lawyers.“Nancy Heinen has a well-earned reputation over 20 years for honesty and integrity, and any rumors to the contrary are without foundation,” said Cristina C. Arguedas, Ms. Heinen’s lawyer.Mr. Anderson’s lawyer did not return calls on Thursday, but an associate of Mr. Anderson’s who declined to be identified because of the complexity of the legal situation said that because of the way the options granting process worked at Apple, it was unlikely that Mr. Anderson would have been in a position to alter option dates.Although he resigned from the job of chief financial officer in 2004 and went on to help found Elevation Partners, a private equity firm, Mr. Anderson spent time at Apple this year reviewing the options matters before resigning from the board.Gene Munster, an analyst with Piper Jaffray who follows Apple, said he did not expect the investigations into Apple’s options practices to implicate Mr. Jobs, who he said had not historically been involved in compensation issues.“Everything we know about Apple is that the compensation side is not something Jobs has ever been involved in,” Mr. Munster said. “The key thing, and the only thing Wall Street cares about, is whether Jobs will be impacted, and we don’t believe he will be.” Piper Jaffray has an outperform rating on Apple stock.'"

"'06-12-29,'0','St. John’s will face Hofstra in tonight’s championship game. The Pride, which has won its last three against St. John’s, advanced with a 65-63 victory over St. Joseph’s.St. John’s could have won the game in regulation, but Lamont Hamilton missed two free throws with 2.2 seconds left. Given another chance, Hamilton made one of two free throws with 1 minute 5 seconds left in overtime to give St. John’s a 45-44 lead. After a Daryll Hill turnover with 17 seconds left, the Terriers had a chance to win, but a hook shot by Omary Peterkin with time running out hit off the front rim.Avery Patterson was the leading scorer for St. John’s with 16 points. The Red Storm shot just 31.9 percent from the floor.There is something about the Holiday Festival that brings out the best in Hofstra. With his team aiming for its fourth trip to the tournament’s championship game in its past four tries, Hofstra’s Loren Stokes made an 18-foot jumper with two seconds left last night to give Hofstra the win over St. Joseph’s.Hofstra (7-4) trailed by as many as 11 points in the second half, but kept chipping away at St. Joseph’s lead. Hofstra took its first lead since early in the game when a pair of Antoine Aguido free throws with 5:15 left put the Pride in front, 60-58. After the Hawks’ Jawan Carter tied the score at 63-63 with 31.3 seconds left, Hofstra Coach Tom Pecora did not have to think twice about his plan.“Everybody in the building knew what we were going to do at the end of the game,” he said. “I’m not that smart a coach. I knew what to do — get the ball to Loren.”Stokes, a senior who is Hofstra’s leading scorer, launched his winning shot from near the top of the key, just inside the 3-point line. A desperation shot at the buzzer by Carter bounced off the backboard.“It’s a great feeling,” Stokes said. “It’s something that will stick with me the rest of my life. I’ll tell my kids about it later on in life.”It has been a mildly disappointing season for Hofstra, which was coming off an 85-60 loss to Syracuse that snapped a six-game winning streak. Hofstra is a guard-oriented team that lacks a strong inside presence, and that has hurt the Pride against bigger teams.Hofstra won the Holiday Festival in 1998 and 1999 and lost in the championship game to Penn State in 2000. The Pride had not appeared in the tournament again until this season.Hofstra is 8-2 in its last 10 games at Madison Square Garden.“We’re a New York team and it’s an honor to play here,” Pecora said of Hofstra’s Holiday Festival success. “The kids get fired up. The magnitude of the Garden is such that even when our European players start to think about Madison Square Garden their eyes light up. You’re not coaching effort when you come to the Garden, you’re coaching basketball. It’s a great showcase for these guys and we all get excited about it.”'"

"'06-12-29,'0','After producing a 20-page report in December 2005, the group dissolved this year amid infighting, with many of its top directors and staff members joining a consortium that is now vying for the state’s lucrative horseracing franchise.In recent months, the advocacy group and one of its founding directors, Jared E. Abbruzzese, have emerged as central elements of separate investigations by the state lobbying commission and a federal grand jury.The lobbying commission is examining whether Mr. Abbruzzese, a businessman and longtime friend of Senator Bruno’s, violated state law by giving free or discounted flights to the senator.Federal authorities are examining, among other things, whether substantial payments by Mr. Abbruzzese to Mr. Bruno’s private consulting firm were part of an effort to influence the senator, who is likely to have a major say over who gets the racing franchise.The authorities have also issued a subpoena to Wayne R. Barr Jr., a lawyer and business associate of Mr. Abbruzzese’s, who helped arrange Mr. Bruno’s trip to Kentucky.The person behind the Friends of New York Racing was Timothy G. Smith, a former executive at the P.G.A. of America, the golf association, and at the National Thoroughbred Racing Association.The new group was formed in late 2004 in response to the economic threat that video lottery terminals and casinos run by Indian tribes posed to the New York and national horse racing industries.“In the current political climate, there is a real risk that the needs of the racing, breeding and pari-mutuel industries simply will be ignored in favor of other revenue-raising options,” the group said in a mission statement on its Web site.In a June deposition to the state lobbying commission, Mr. Smith said he was “very alarmed” when Gov. George E. Pataki raised the idea of expanding legalized gambling in a budget address in January 2005.“I concluded that horse racing had made itself largely irrelevant to the state,” Mr. Smith said, adding that racing needed to demonstrate that “we’re important, we have a lot of jobs, we’re politically relevant.”Mr. Smith, a lifelong Democrat, said he met Mr. Bruno in 1970 when they worked on the re-election campaign of Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller, a Republican.Mr. Smith enlisted 10 organizations — a mixture of businesses and nonprofit groups — to each contribute $100,000 to create the Friends of New York Racing. All 10 organizations worked in racing or gambling except one: Capital & Technology Advisors, a consulting firm founded by Mr. Abbruzzese, Mr. Bruno’s longtime friend.The Friends of New York Racing worked to curry favor with Mr. Bruno, playing host to a fund-raiser in Saratoga Springs, N.Y., on Aug. 12, 2005, and the Kentucky reception less than two months later.Mr. Abbruzzese and Mr. Barr arranged Mr. Bruno’s flight to Kentucky, according to the deposition and flight records.Mr. Smith, who was on the Kentucky trip but did not travel with Mr. Bruno, did not respond to requests for comment. Lawyers for Mr. Abbruzzese and Mr. Barr declined to comment.In its final report in December 2005, the Friends of New York Racing said that the industry was in financial jeopardy under the nonprofit New York Racing Association and that the state should “permit any form of business or venture” to compete for the franchise.The report was the group’s final public act. Within two months, its board voted to dissolve. Two consortiums of horse racing and gambling interests quickly formed, each competing to bid for the work.The first consortium, Empire Racing Associates, included Mr. Abbruzzese and Mr. Smith, as well as Churchill Downs and the Magna Entertainment Corporation, which are leading owners of racetracks and founding members of the Friends of New York Racing. The former vice president of the Friends and two former members of its board of advisers are involved with Empire.The second consortium, Excelsior Racing Associates, includes Steve Swindal, a managing general partner of the Yankees; Richard Fields, a casino developer; Tishman Speyer Properties, a developer; Bill Mulrow, a former candidate for state comptroller close to Governor-elect Eliot Spitzer; and Jerry Bilinski, the veterinarian who accompanied Mr. Bruno to Kentucky. R. Wayne Diesel, a former state budget director who was on the board of the Friends, is advising Excelsior.Several of the founders of the Friends of New York Racing said they were startled by how quickly the group disbanded.“When we entered into this arrangement, we assumed this body was going to be a completely neutral body to design the best method of making N.Y.R.A. effective,” said Sherwood C. Chillingworth of the nonprofit Oak Tree Racing Association in Arcadia, Calif., which was one of the 10 groups that contributed $100,000 to the Friends of New York Racing.“We’re surprised to see so many people associated with that group spin off these into these competing organizations.”In November, a state advisory committee recommended that the franchise be awarded to Excelsior, but the decision is really up to Mr. Spitzer, Mr. Bruno and the Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver.Records of Mr. Bruno’s trip to Kentucky, among other flights, have been turned over to federal prosecutors, according to an official with knowledge of the investigation.With so much scrutiny on Mr. Bruno, ties to the senator may be more of a liability than an asset. This week, Empire announced it was severing all ties with Mr. Abbruzzese and buying out his 6 percent share, citing the “distraction” created by the inquiries.'"
"'06-12-29,'0','“Apple is in a much more difficult position than other companies in the backdating morass, because a significant portion of its market valuation is based on Steve Jobs staying at his job,” he said.The company has said that Mr. Jobs knew of some backdated grants, but that he did not knowingly receive any of them and had not benefited from the practice.As part of its annual report, the company will most likely say more about the findings of a three-month investigation it commissioned to look into its accounting for stock options. One former Securities and Exchange Commission official said that if Mr. Jobs signs the document, as he is required to do under Sarbanes-Oxley, and Apple’s auditors endorse that signature, it would indicate that the auditors feel he is not in jeopardy.“The fact that the auditors would accept the Jobs certification reflects that they were satisfied that the internal investigation had been thorough and that the results of the internal report could be relied upon,” said Michael D. Mann, a partner at the New York law firm of Richards Kibbe & Orbe and a former director of the Office of International Affairs at the S.E.C.Apple’s auditor, KPMG, has been trying to avoid controversy since it reached a deferred-prosecution agreement with the Justice Department last year in a case involving illegal tax shelters. Analysts said that would lead the firm to be particularly vigilant in its auditing of options cases.James D. Cox, a professor of corporate and securities law at Duke University, said the report could still contain some unpleasant surprises. “The mere fact that he is producing a report with his signature doesn’t mean the report doesn’t contain damning information,” Professor Cox said. “Assuming the report identifies false documents, does it make clear statements as to who is responsible and, equally, as to who is not responsible, and why?”The options issues at Apple, which the company first disclosed in June, came back into the spotlight this week when The Recorder, a San Francisco newspaper owned by American Lawyer Media, reported that the investigation conducted by a law firm on Apple’s behalf had found that options documents had been falsified to increase the value of grants to Apple executives.On Thursday, The Financial Times reported that investigators had discovered an options grant to Mr. Jobs that had not been properly authorized by the company’s board.The two reports, which did not name sources, sent shares of Apple on a roller-coaster ride. The shares declined 65 cents, to $80.87 on Thursday, and are down 1.6 percent for the week after falling as low as $76.77 on Wednesday.A spokesman for Apple, Steve Dowling, said the company planned to meet its target for filing the report, and declined to comment further. “We’re providing all details to the S.E.C. and not commenting,” Mr. Dowling said.In an e-mail message, a spokesman for the United States attorney’s office in San Francisco, which in July created a special joint task force with the Federal Bureau of Investigation to investigate stock option backdating, declined to comment.After the review of its options accounting practices, Apple said in October that while there had been 15 instances of backdating, the review had found no misconduct by any member of Apple’s current management team.The language of Apple’s statement, coupled with the simultaneous resignation from the board of Fred D.

"'06-12-29,'0','The reluctance of farmers is only one part of the problem. Monsanto and its competitors have not been able to create new varieties of trans-fat-free soybeans fast enough to meet the demand for more varied uses. And the situation is only going to get worse: in the three weeks since New York City announced it would ban trans fat from its restaurants, several major cities and some states, including California, have begun considering similar measures.“Everybody knows the situation; you just can’t pull this stuff out of a sock,” said Kelly Brintle, senior vice president of Ventura Foods, a California company that processes and sells edible oils and is also trying to persuade farmers to produce a lot more of the special soybeans. “Our phones are ringing off the wall.”Trans fat, which is in foods as diverse as cookies and French fries, is created when food manufacturers add hydrogen to vegetable oil, a process called hydrogenation, to increase the shelf life of food and stabilize flavors. For several decades, it was considered a healthier alternative to butter and tropical oils, which contain saturated fats.But in the 1990s, scientists became convinced that trans fat was more dangerous than the fats it replaced. Not only does it raise the level of unhealthy cholesterol, it lowers the level of the kind of cholesterol that is considered desirable.A strange twist to the current supply squeeze for trans-fat-free soybean oil is that the seeds were created more than a decade ago, but for years, there were no buyers. One seed company, Pioneer Hi-Bred International, finally stopped research on new varieties in 1999 because of the dismal prospects.“We waited and waited,” said Russ Sanders, marketing director at Pioneer, which is now part of DuPont. “Now the market is expanding faster than we can keep up.”As a result, seed companies and oil manufacturers are offering farmers 21 cents to 80 cents a bushel extra to grow the low-linolenic soybeans.Monsanto has made arrangements with 14 processing plants across the Midwestern corn belt to process the beans next year, and it has held several meetings with neighboring farmers at each plant to make their sales pitch.“Our guys are working really hard to sign up as many growers as possible, but obviously there are challenges,” said Christopher R. Horner, a Monsanto spokesman.This year, farmers planted about three-quarters of a million acres of low-linolenic soybeans, about a third to a half of what is needed to meet the demand, said Steven W. Poole, a spokesman for Qualisoy, an association that researches and promotes soybeans with enhanced traits.Ultimately, Mr. Poole anticipates that as many as five million acres of low-linolenic soybeans could be planted in the United States as more partially hydrogenated oils are replaced.The soybeans are not the only alternative to partially hydrogenated vegetable oil. Some food companies have already switched to palm oil, canola oil or sunflower oil, all products that are growing rapidly. Given the difference between supply and demand, prices have risen for many of these oils as well.But palm oil is high in saturated fats, so health advocates argue that using it substitutes one problem for another. The other oils have their supporters — Frito-Lay uses corn oil and sunflower oil, for example, while Wendy’s uses a soybean-corn blend and Taco Bell recently switched to trans-fat-free canola oil.But many of the alternatives are more expensive than soybean oil, which accounts for two-thirds of the edible oils consumed in the United States.KFC decided to move away from partially hydrogenated soybean oil about three years ago. After testing a variety of oils and getting its food purchasing cooperative to line up farmers to grow low-lin soybeans, the fried chicken chain finally announced the switch in October.“The soybean oils were the best fit for us because the flavor profile was closest to our original recipe,” said Laurie Schalow, a spokeswoman for the company, which is a division of Yum Brands.McDonald’s is still trying to figure out how to reduce trans fat in its cooking oil, even as pressure mounts from critics and governments intent on banning it. The company announced in 2002 that it was reducing trans fat in its frying oil, but it has struggled to find an adequate substitute that does not change the taste of its French fries.The trick for creating alternatives to partially hydrogenated vegetable oils is maintaining the ability to be heated — or in the case of frying, reheated — without ruining the taste or texture of foods. Low-lin soybeans are popular because their oil can be repeatedly reheated without changing the flavor of foods much, if at all. But while it often works in fast-food restaurants, where the fried food is served promptly, the oil is not as successful in products that require a longer shelf life.A much larger market depends on several soybean seeds that are not yet available in large quantities: increased-oleic soybeans for processed foods like cookies and chips and increased-oleic, high-stearate soybeans for baked goods like cakes and pies.The holy grail remains finding a trans-fat-free soybean shortening for baked goods with just enough saturated fat to remain solid.“To make a nice biscuit or a nice cake, you have to have a solid fat,” said Bill Hitz, director of food and feed research at Pioneer. “You need some saturates.”All of this, of course, is good news for Iowa’s farmers, who should benefit from new varieties of soybeans that offer premiums. Those fortunate enough to live close to both an ethanol plant and a soybean plant that processes low-linolenic beans find themselves in a relatively rare circumstance: choosing between high-priced soybeans or higher-priced corn, at least as long as the ethanol boom continues.“It’s going to be a real hard decision for farmers,” said Paul Bruett, a sales representative for BB& P Feed and Grain in Winterset, Iowa. “Right now, the economic return is better for corn. So it’s going to be a real tug of war as we get closer to planting season.”He estimated that corn would return $60 to $100 more an acre than low-linolenic soybeans.But not every farmer in Iowa has that choice.James Devin, 35, of Knoxville, Iowa, said farmers south of Interstate 80, where he lives, generally have to rotate growing corn and soybeans because the land is rolling and prone to erosion, so it cannot support corn year after year. Mr. Devin said a 50-cent a bushel premium was easy money, since all he had to do was keep the low-linolenic beans separate from his conventional soybeans.“Here’s your chance to increase your revenue by 50 cents without really doing anything,” he said. “The yields are about the same or better. I’d say they are my best bean.”But he acknowledged that most of his neighbors had not planted low-linolenic soybeans because of the inconvenience of keeping the beans separate and transporting them separately for processing.While Mr. Tilstra, from Steen, Minn., used to grow half soybeans and half corn, he now plants two-thirds of his land with corn. For soybeans, he said, “the premium is 21 cents. We’re not going to do a lot of work for that. You’ll always go corn unless that premium is outlandish, $1 or $1.25.”Kenneth Fawcett, 57, of West Branch, Iowa, said he, too, is the exception in his part of eastern Iowa. He has planted low-lin soybeans for three years and collected premiums as high as 80 cents a bushel because his soybeans are not genetically modified to be herbicide-resistant, and thus can be sold at a higher price.But he said most of his neighbors are more likely to plant corn or regular soybeans because low-linolenic soybeans are too much work. In addition to the need to keep them separate, he said, the processing plant accepts them only a couple of days each month.“I think a lot of people want to grow the beans because it’s the right thing,” Mr. Fawcett said, but, “the economics have to be there to reward them.”'"

On top of that, chief executives are made whole on lucrative pension benefits, often being credited at the new company for years of service elsewhere — a perk rarely available to nonexecutive employees.These days, though, some executives are demanding that companies make up losses they may face from the sale of a home if they relocate, or that they receive price protection on losses they might incur in stock they own in the company they are leaving.The problem with make-whole payments, critics say, is that they have become so common and widespread that lesser-known chief executives from smaller companies can demand multimillion-dollar foundations on which other benefits and perks are layered.The existence of the golden hello undermines the very reason stock options and executive pensions are offered in the first place — to encourage executives to hit performance targets and then to stick around to receive the full value of their compensation package.“The whole rationale for giving larger bonuses and larger payouts to executives is that their total pay package is supposed to be riskier than that of the average worker,” says Eleanor Bloxham, president of the Value Alliance, a group that advises companies on corporate governance. “What’s happening with these make-whole packages is that they have no relationship with performance at the new company. You’re paying people, really, a guaranteed bonus or, in fact, a guaranteed everything.”At most companies, the stock options and restricted stock typically awarded to executives are tied to performance targets or, at the very least, require many years of service to vest. They are not sure things, particularly stock options, as they may take years to vest and could be worthless if the company’s stock falls or the chief executive fails to hit major performance targets.Yet, an executive who jumps ship can virtually guarantee a multimillion-dollar payout by the new company. While new chief executives these days are typically not given huge cash payouts as soon as they walk through the door, they usually are awarded the value of the pay package they left behind simply by sticking around for three to five years, executive pay watchdogs note.Furthermore, the huge pension benefit packages and other retirement perks that chief executives are demanding come at a time when many corporations are severely reducing pension benefits for employees. While top executives are credited for years of service they did not work in order to more rapidly vest their supplemental executive retirement plans, or SERPs, employees of several large corporations have seen their traditional defined-benefit plans frozen or sharply reduced this year in favor of less-generous 401(k) plans that do not offer the same guaranteed payouts.At Boeing, efforts are under way to move more employees out of defined-benefit plans and into defined-contribution plans, says Charles Bofferding, the executive director at the Society of Professional Engineering Employees in Aerospace, the union that represents 21,000 Boeing employees.“They’re doing that to everyone but the big dogs, who continue to get defined-benefit plans,” Mr. Bofferding said. “When you have a different set of principles for the top people versus the rest of the employees, it undermines the top people’s moral authority to lead.”Executive recruiters, compensation lawyers and analysts argue, however, that even companies that are reducing benefits to their work forces must offer golden hellos and other perks simply to compete for the limited pool of top-tier chief executive talent in the marketplace. For instance, Boeing, like so many companies that wind up paying big price tags for chief executives, was in desperate need of an outsider with a stellar reputation to earn back the trust of shareholders and Wall Street. In addition, Boeing was concerned about government investigators.In 2003, the chief executive, Philip M. Condit, resigned in the wake of an investigation into Pentagon contracts. His successor, Harry C. Stonecipher, was forced out in March 2005 for having an affair with a female executive.At 3M, Mr. McNerney was turning in a stellar performance. After he left 3M, Mr. McNerney exercised more than 2.1 million stock options for gains of more than $32.3 million, according to Equilar. Also, about 40 percent of Mr. McNerney’s restricted stock had vested, as well as about half of his $22 million pension.To match what Mr. McNerney was leaving behind at 3M, Boeing’s board offered him $25.2 million worth of restricted shares that vest in three-, five- and six-year increments, as well as the equivalent of full funding of his entire 3M pension, although he needs to remain at Boeing for five years to be eligible for it.But McNerney’s pension could grow even bigger. A clause in his contract says that his pension will be based on the three consecutive years within the 10 years before leaving Boeing when he received the highest pay, whether that occurred at Boeing, at 3M or even General Electric.“Boeing has gone further into territory that even I have not seen before,” says Paul Hodgson, a senior research associate at the Corporate Library, an institutional advisory firm in Portland, Me. “Boeing shareholders are being asked to fund a pension potentially based on what 3M and G.E. paid McNerney, rather than what they themselves paid him. Such an arrangement would seem to take inappropriate to a new level.”John Dern, a spokesman for Boeing, said: “Jim McNerney’s compensation is generally equivalent to what he was receiving at his previous company and in keeping with compensation practices at other large companies. It recognizes the value that he brings to Boeing and the company’s performance has borne that out.”For shareholders, the high price Boeing paid to lure Mr. McNerney has yielded results. He has moved to put many of Boeing’s ethical lapses behind it: the company agreed this summer with federal prosecutors in California and Virginia to pay $615 million to settle allegations concerning use of competitors’ information to bid on government contracts, and improper conduct in the hiring of a former government procurement officer.Operationally, the company is beating its archrival, Airbus, in airplane orders this year. Its stock has soared 44 percent since Mr. McNerney got the job, compared with an 18 percent gain by the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index.“I’m fine with McNerney’s pay from a shareholder perspective,” said Don Delves, a Chicago-based corporate governance and executive pay consultant. “I’m a shareholder at Boeing and we’ve been through a tumultuous time. Yeah, McNerney is expensive, but we’re getting one of the top three people in the horse race to replace Jack Welch at G.E.”Yet even less-well-known chief executives are getting perks to make up for what they had in their previous jobs.For instance, after ousting Carleton S. Fiorina as chief executive in 2005, Hewlett-Packard’s board turned to Mark V. Hurd, a little-known executive at NCR, to replace her.Mr. Hurd, who had already exercised stock options at NCR in 2005 worth $14.7 million, received a $2 million signing bonus; relocation benefits worth $2.7 million; 450,000 stock option shares worth $2.4 million; and 400,000 restricted shares worth about $8.1 million, according to Equilar.But Mr. Hurd’s employment agreement included an interesting twist. If NCR’s stock fell by any amount up to 20 percent within 90 days of Mr. Hurd’s leaving the company, Hewlett-Packard agreed to reimburse him for the losses he would have incurred on the 850,000 shares of NCR stock he still held. Hewlett-Packard said it paid Mr. Hurd a little more than $5 million for his losses in NCR stock.“This isn’t inside the norm,” said Jack Dolmat-Connell, a compensation adviser in Waltham, Mass. “But because he knew he was leaving, that was probably considered inside information, so he actually could not do anything with those shares.”Executives are not only getting price protection on stock, but they are also demanding price protection on the sale of homes if they have to relocate.Take Robert H. Swan, who joined eBay in March as its chief financial officer. Several months after leaving his post as finance chief of Electronic Data Systems, Mr. Swan was granted a supplemental relocation benefit by eBay’s board “in light of the condition of the Plano, Texas, residential real estate market,” according to a regulatory filing.If Mr. Swan’s Texas home sold for less than $3 million, the company would pay the difference, up to $700,000. (While Texas records indicate the home was sold in late August, the state does not make residential price information public.)A spokeswoman for eBay said details of any payment made to Mr. Swan for his home would be made public when the company files its proxy next year.'"
"'06-12-29,'0','Opponents hope to bring Congressional pressure to bear to derail the policy before it becomes final or at least to require that such foods be labeled so consumers can choose to avoid them. F.D.A. officials said that it was unlikely that labeling would be required because food from cloned animals is indistinguishable from other food, although a final decision about labeling has not been made.Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, yesterday called for a “careful, deliberative and open process” before cloned animals are approved for food.The F.D.A.’s finding comes more than six years after the agency first decided to study the matter, after recognizing that the advent of cloned farm animals raised a food safety issue. After that study, the agency in 2003 gave a tentative approval to cloned animals for food. But the F.D.A. retreated after its own advisory panel found there was insufficient scientific backing for that conclusion.This time, F.D.A. officials said they had substantial new data, which they presented yesterday in a nearly 700-page “draft risk assessment.”The officials denied the contention from some critics that the policy was announced during a holiday week in order to reduce publicity, saying it had taken until now to analyze the data and obtain comment from other government agencies.The assessment concluded that milk and meat from cloned cows, pigs and goats, and from their offspring, were “as safe to eat as the food we eat every day,” Stephen F. Sundlof, the F.D.A.’s chief of veterinary medicine, said in a telephone call with reporters.Mr. Sundlof said that by law the agency could consider only the scientific issues, not consumer demand or the ethics of cloning.While animal cloning has always been legal, since 2001 there has been a voluntary moratorium on the sales of milk or meat from such animals to give the F.D.A. time to study the matter. Some experts say that some products from clones or their offspring have probably nonetheless made their way into the food supply.The moratorium will stay in place until the new policy is completed, after a 90-day period for public comment and additional time for the F.D.A. to review the comments. Mr. Sundlof said he could not say when the final policy would be ready, though it might be by the end of 2007.Even then, the moratorium would remain for products from sheep, the F.D.A. said, because there was not enough evidence of their safety. No one has yet succeeded in cloning chickens or other poultry.The finding was hailed by cloning companies, which have been struggling to build a business. It also drew praise from some farmers and breeders who have already made clones of their prized livestock but have had to pour milk down the drain and keep their meat off the market.They say that cloning is just another breeding technique, like artificial insemination or in-vitro fertilization.“This just sort of lifts the stigma of the clones,” said Bob Schauf, a Holstein breeder and dairy farmer in Barron, Wis., who had two of his prized cows cloned. He said his family and the families of his employees have been drinking the milk from those clones rather than see it go to waste. But dairy marketers have expressed concern.A survey conducted last summer by the International Dairy Foods Association, an industry trade group, found that 14 percent of women would turn away from all dairy products if milk from clones were introduced into the food supply. The association surveyed women because its research has found them to be the main household decision makers on dairy products.The American Meat Institute, while saying yesterday that cloning was safe, also urged the F.D.A. to be cautious about approval “if most consumers are unwilling to accept the technology.”A poll this month from the nonprofit Pew Initiative on Food and Biotechnology found that while most consumers knew little about animal cloning, 64 percent said they were uncomfortable with it, with 46 percent saying they were “strongly uncomfortable.”F.D.A. officials said no other country had yet approved food from cloned livestock, although some are considering it. That raised the prospect that American exports of milk or meat could be blocked by certain countries if they contain products from cloned animals. An official in the Washington delegation of the European Union said politicians and consumers in Europe would no doubt debate the issue.Carol Tucker Foreman, director for food policy at the Consumer Federation of America, said consumer groups would ask food companies, retailers and restaurant chains to shun products from cloned livestock.That raises the possibility that some food companies will label their products “clone free,” just as some now label milk as not coming from cows injected with growth hormone.Cloning involves putting an animal’s DNA into an egg thats own DNA has been removed. The resulting embryo, after being implanted into a surrogate mother, makes a genetically identical copy of the original animal.But even if two animals have identical genes, they can turn out differently if those genes are turned on or off at different times. And studies have shown that patterns of gene activity are different in embryos created by cloning compared with embryos created by the fusing of sperm and egg.These differences are presumed to account in large measure for the low success rate of cloning. Fetuses can grow unusually large, posing a risk to the surrogate mother. Many clones die during gestation or shortly after birth. Some are born with deformed heads or limbs or problems with their hearts, lungs or other organs.But the F.D.A. said that obviously sick and deformed animals were already barred from the food supply. It added that clones that survived past the first few days “appear to grow and develop normally” and that healthy adult clones were “virtually indistinguishable” from noncloned livestock, making their meat or milk safe.The draft assessment based its conclusions on an extensive review of scientific literature on cloning as well as on studies, some done by cloning companies, comparing the composition of the milk, meat and blood of cloned animals and conventional animals.Mr. Sundlof said the agency also found that cloning “poses no unique risks to the health of animals” beyond those seen with other forms of assisted reproduction such as in-vitro fertilization. The frequency of problems is higher with cloning, however, perhaps because it is a newer technology. The first cloned mammal, Dolly the sheep, was born in 1996.The F.D.A.’s announcement, by paving the way for the end of the moratorium, could make it easier to persuade farmers and breeders to pay $15,000 to copy a prized bull or dairy cow.“I think that this draft is going to provide the industry the comfort it needs,” said Mark Walton, president of ViaGen, a cloning company based in Austin, Tex., that has yet to turn a profit after five years.Industry officials estimate there are now only about 500 or 600 cloned cows in the United States, out of tens of millions of beef and dairy cows. There are roughly 200 cloned pigs.Experts say that cloning is too expensive to be used to make animals only to then grind them into hamburger or even to milk them. Rather, farmers and breeders are cloning prized livestock so they can then be used for breeding using more conventional means of reproduction.That means that most food from cloning would come from the sexually produced offspring of the cloned animals. The F.D.A. said milk and meat from such offspring were safe, because any abnormalities in clones do not carry into the next generation.The agency’s assessment did not include genetically modified animals, in which a foreign gene is introduced. The agency is still deciding whether to allow the first of those, a fast-growing fish, into the food supply.'"
"'06-12-29,'0','Edwin David Edwards, whose accusations of improper currency transactions at Citibank mired it in scandal, died Dec. 21 at a hospice care center near his home in Wichita Falls, Tex. He was 62.The cause was cancer, his brother, Mark Edwards said.Mr. Edwards, known as David, was the Citibank employee at the center of the so-called Edwards Affair in the late 1970s to early 1980s that raised questions about the bank’s foreign exchange trading practices and eventually entangled the company under the watch of its chairman, Walter Wriston.In 1975, Mr. Edwards, then a junior executive, accused a senior trader of taking kickbacks and suggested that Citibank was improperly shifting, or “parking,” profits from European currency transactions to countries like the Bahamas where they would be taxed at lower rates. He also accused Citibank of booking false transactions through its Bahamas branch.Though Citibank brushed off his concerns and eventually fired Mr. Edwards, his suspicions triggered eight years of investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission, Congress and six European regulators. The S.E.C. ultimately declined to take action, and other investigations cleared the trader of the kickback charges and caused Citibank to pay back taxes and minor fines.But the author, Phillip L. Zweig, noted in his 1995 biography of Mr. Wriston that the episode was the wake-up call or more accurately, the bomb blast, that signaled that the bank’s size had far outpaced its ability to manage itself.'"
"'06-12-29,'0','The house outside which he spoke belongs to a quality-assurance inspector at Luzianne, a local coffee and tea maker. The homeowner, Orelia Tyler, had floodwater up to her roof and has been living in a FEMA trailer. Dazzled by the senator’s attention, Ms. Tyler said, “I’m hoping and praying he’s doing it to help me get back in my house, and not for publicity.”As Mr. Edwards spoke, limbs from the dead tree in back of him, which were pushed down by the storm, still rested on the chain-link fence at the yard’s edge; in the distance was a toppled basketball goal; a giant rusting ventilator fan lay on the ground.“We need to call on Americans to be patriotic for something other than war,” Mr. Edwards said.Implicit in his brief remarks was criticism of the Bush administration’s handling of New Orleans’s foundering recovery. In Mr. Edwards’s telling, the city was exemplary in both positive and negative senses, as a symbol of citizen action and government inaction. This was his fourth visit since the storm, and he spent part of the well-photographed previous day shoveling mud outside the same house.Thursday, the ex-senator praised the army of volunteers that has gutted hundreds of houses and removed debris, but he pointedly omitted any recognition of the patchy official efforts.He saved his criticism of Mr. Bush’s New Orleans role for a question-and-answer session afterwards, telling reporters, “This is a place where presidential leadership would have been critical.”Asked how he would have handled New Orleans, Mr. Edwards responded: “I would have had somebody coming into my office every morning, and I would say to him, ‘What did you do in New Orleans yesterday?’ And then the next day, ‘What did you do yesterday? What steps do we need to take? What are we not doing? What are the people in New Orleans telling us that we’re not doing?’ ”He said the next president would “need to re-establish America’s leadership role in the world,” called for quick withdrawal of 40,000 to 50,000 troops from Iraq, and said it “would be a mistake for America to escalate its role in Iraq.”Roundly denouncing the administration’s approach, he said, “You can’t lead through raw power.”He expressed regret for his Senate vote to authorize force in Iraq. “My vote was a mistake,” he said. “I should never have voted for the war.”Afterward, Mr. Edwards headed for Iowa and a town-hall-style meeting in Des Moines. He has assiduously courted the electorate in Iowa, the first state to hold a presidential vote; this visit will be his 16th since the 2004 election. Several recent local polls have shown him in a leading position in Iowa, where he finished second in the 2004 caucuses.WASHINGTON, Dec. 28 (AP) — Mr. Edwards has sold his house in the city’s Georgetown section for $5.2 million, said W. Ted Gossett, the real estate agent who confirmed the sale.Mr. Edwards bought the house, on P Street, for $3.8 million in 2002 and extensively renovated it. After his two younger children finished the 2004-5 school year, the family returned to North Carolina, where Mr. Edwards built a home on a 100-acre tract in Chapel Hill. The Georgetown house, which has six bedrooms, had been on the market since the spring of 2005. As of last week, the advertised price was $5.6 million. It was sold Tuesday, Mr. Gossett said.'"
"'06-12-29,'0','The Nasdaq stock market will be closed on Tuesday to mark the death of former President Gerald R. Ford after the date was deemed a national day of mourning, the market said yesterday.President Bush declared Jan. 2 a national day of mourning for Mr. Ford, who died this week, effectively closing federal offices on Tuesday.Mr. Ford’s body will be flown to Washington tomorrow and his casket will lie in state at the Capitol.President Bush will speak at a service in his memory on Tuesday, a White House spokesman said.Mr. Ford, the 38th president, had served on the NASD board from 1999 to 2000. “His leadership and invaluable service during his time on the NASD board contributed to what the Nasdaq is today,” said Robert Greifeld, chief executive of Nasdaq.The exchanges have historically closed on a United States president’s national day of mourning, as they did in June 2004 in observance of the death of President Ronald W. Reagan.The New York Stock Exchange said that it was waiting for an executive order to declare Tuesday a federal holiday, and was expected to announce its plans later.Because New Year’s Day is on Monday, the exchanges will be commemorating President Ford on a holiday-shortened week, causing some speculation that there would be reluctance to close for a second full day.'"
"'06-12-29,'0','“I like to say that this is a 134-year-old institution that just found itself over the past year,” Mr. Schaeffer said.So far, it has also found success. Nymex’s initial public offering on Nov. 17 was the among the most successful of 2006. The exchange’s share price more than doubled on its first day of trading, jumping to $132.99 from its $59 opening price. (The stock closed yesterday at $122.40.)Now, Mr. Schaeffer and Mr. Newsome are looking for further growth, though both men were silent about whether Nymex might seek a merger partner. In April, Nymex signed a deal to list its energy futures and options contracts on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange’s Globex electronic exchange, supplanting its own smaller system. And two weeks ago, Nymex announced the introduction of its new reinsurance contracts, which will allow for the trading of property damage risk exposures.The exchange will also continue work on the start of the Oman crude oil futures contract, a project with the Dubai government. Mr. Newsome said the contract was three years in the making and one that could play a significant role in Asian markets.“That will be our crown jewel,” he said. “It’s something no one’s ever done before.”Staying competitive will be the challenge as electronic trading, consolidation and new products transform the world’s exchanges. Nymex had long been the leader in energy trading, but earlier this year, its younger rival, the InterContinental Exchange, or ICE, introduced an all-electronic trading operation for energy contracts and quickly swiped a big share of that market from Nymex.With the introduction of its own electronic-trading system via the Globex network, Nymex regained much of that. But as ICE prepares to acquire the New York Board of Trade, it remains a fierce rival for Nymex’s business.Mr. Schaeffer and Mr. Newsome first came together over how to fight off ICE. The two men had taken different roads to Nymex.For Mr. Schaeffer, the chairmanship was the culmination of more than two decades working at the exchange: he first joined in 1981, buying a seat at the behest of a friend who taught him how to trade commodities. The former accountant worked at trading companies like the Chicago Corporation and the energy trading operation of ABN Amro. He became Nymex’s treasurer in 1993 and vice chairman in 2004.Mr. Newsome took a more circuitous route. After growing up in Plant City, Fla., he studied food and resource economics, eventually becoming a professor at Mississippi State University and then a cattle trade executive. But it was not until 1998, when he joined the Commodity Futures TradingCommission, the federal regulator of futures exchanges like Nymex, that Mr. Newsome seriously entered the world of commodities trading.He then began serving as director in 2000, just as Congress broadened the mandate of the commission and just before the Enron scandal exploded. Mr. Newsome said he then began working with Nymex both to put in place the agency’s new rules and to investigate the nature of Enron’s energy-trading operation.After his term was up in 2004, he was approached by Vincent Viola, then Nymex’s chairman, who told the commissioner that he could do some good at the exchange.“I was in such shock that I didn’t tell my wife at first when I got home,” he said.When he arrived, Mr. Newsome said he did not know Mr. Schaeffer particularly well. But the two found that they had a similar idea of how to shore up Nymex’s position against the ICE.Supported by the private-equity firm General Atlantic, which took a 10 percent stake in Nymex last year, the two began talking with members to gain support for their plan, intended to provide the exchange with the freedom and the capital to compete against its nimbler competitors.But other Nymex members saw things differently. The shift to a public company demanded a smaller board. Mr. Schaeffer and Mr. Newsome also sought to push for more electronic trading, alongside the open-outcry system of specialists’ shouting orders that had long characterized the exchange’s operations. Combined, the moves represented a sea change for the exchange.“Culturally, some people were very dug into the current process,” Mr. Newsome said. “There was some pushback every step of the way.”One longtime Nymex trader, Daniel Dicker, spoke out this year about his concerns over the exchange’s future. Today, he says that he is fine with the progress Mr. Schaeffer and Mr. Newsome have made.“They’ve taken on some very difficult decisions,” he said.'"
"'06-12-29,'0','The I.R.S. does not break down its data on state-to-state migration by tax bracket, so it is unclear how many people earning more than $500,000 a year moved to or from New Jersey last year.Regardless of what is happening with the very rich, James W. Hughes, dean of the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers, said New Jersey was losing too many middle-income people because of high property taxes and housing costs.The number of residents going to other states has been increasing for years, Mr. Hughes said, and the most recent annual loss reported by the Census Bureau was 72,547 — “probably the highest net out-migration we’ve ever had.”Overall, with immigration and births factored in, the state’s population actually grew by about 21,000 people in the last year, bringing it to more than 8.7 million people.“For companies that try to transfer people into New Jersey, there’s always the issue of sticker shock and higher housing costs,” Mr. Hughes said. “So one way of looking at this is that the only people who can move here are the higher-income ones.”The 2005 tax data did not include the 54,000 immigrants who settled in New Jersey last year. If they are on the lower end of the income scale, Mr. Hughes pointed out, that could offset the increased median income from the interstate moves.“It may well be that some of the people moving in are high-income New Yorkers moving to the Hudson County waterfront or to Montclair,” he said, “but given a 54,000 gap, do we still have a net gain?”New York is by far the biggest contributor to New Jersey’s population, as it has been for decades. Pennsylvania, which lost 12,774 households to New Jersey last year, is second, and Florida, with 6,065, is third.New Jersey residents who left last year were moving to New York most often, but almost as many went to Pennsylvania (18,806 households) and Florida (17,369 households).Most of them were retirees or younger families in search of bigger houses, said Mr. Evans of New Jersey Future, who has traced migration in and out of New Jersey in detail. He documents a continuing westward flow across the northern tier of the state and into Pennsylvania while Philadelphia sends people to South Jersey.As for who is moving to New York State, with less income than the New Yorkers moving to New Jersey, Mr. Evans said one big destination might be Orange County, which is still less expensive than the northern New Jersey counties across the border. “If anyone is moving to New York City,” he said, “it has to be to Manhattan or the hip parts of Brooklyn.”And those would be primarily young people, he said, “the ones who can live in a shoebox.”'"
"'06-12-29,'0','Institutional or not, hedge funds are still more colorful, more outrageous, more impressive and more bizarre than other asset managers. They are the new, new money thing. And they deserve special recognitions of their own.So let’s hand out the hedge fund awards for 2006.THE HOUDINI AWARD To Amaranth Advisors and its founder, Nicholas Maounis, for overseeing the evaporation of $6 billion in less than one week at the hands of a 32-year-old Ferrari-driving energy trader. Amaranth had been a respectable fund; investors loved it for its high returns and energy exposure, until the high returns turned into epic losses and its energy “exposure” turned out to be a bunch of concentrated bets on the direction of natural-gas prices (bets that did not work out well).Soon after $6 billion went poof, Mr. Maounis tried to pull a rabbit out of his hat. On a brief, carefully lawyered phone call with investors, Mr. Maounis suggested that he intended to win back the trust and faith of his investors. “We have every intention of continuing in business generating for our investors the same consistently high risk-adjusted returns which have been our hallmark.” Right.THE BETTER-THAN-BARINGS BLOW-UP AWARD Amaranth’s energy trader, Brian Hunter, blew through more cash in less time at Amaranth than, well, than anyone I can think of. When Nicholas Leeson, a young trader at Barings Bank in Singapore, blew up Barings, he burned through $1.3 billion. When Long Term Capital Management imploded in 1998, its $4.8 billion quickly shrank to $600 million (although enormous leverage magnified the losses and brought the financial system to its knees). Bayou lost $460 million, $100 million less than Amaranth lost on Sept. 14.THE BRAVEHEART AWARD Phillip Goldstein was an unknown hedge fund manager at an unremarkable hedge fund, Bulldog Investors, until he sued the Securities and Exchange Commission, contending that the agency did not have the authority to regulate hedge funds, and won. As a result, the court vacated the controversial registration requirement and left the S.E.C. with little authority over hedge funds.The S.E.C. is now contemplating a rule that will prohibit all but 1.3 percent of Americans from investing in hedge funds. It also rewrote a fraud provision that at least allows it to go after, well, fraud.THE DEBUTANTES AWARD The Citadel Investment Group filed a prospectus to raise as much as $2 billion in bonds, a creative financing strategy that when accomplished, makes Citadel slightly less dependent on Wall Street and slightly more similar to a normal company that has various forms of debt. The Fortress Investment Group also announced its intention to sell shares to the public. The upshot from its offering documents? The people running alternative investment groups make boatloads of money.THE GRETA GARBO AWARD She just wanted to be left alone. So did Christopher Hohn, the founder and brainpower behind the Children’s Investment Fund, a $9 billion activist fund based in London that donates a portion of its fees to a foundation run by Jamie Cooper Hohn, Mr. Hohn’s wife. When provided an opportunity to talk about the fund’s charitable work, neither Hohn returned any calls — those who did answer phones would not acknowledge that a foundation existed; yet, in June, former President Bill Clinton spoke at a fund gathering and praised the foundation.THE BUYER BEWARE AWARD Shakespeare questioned the power of a name and so should investors. Viper Capital Management, a fund in San Francisco, has been sued by the Securities and Exchange Commission for fleecing investors out of $5 million. Pirate Capital, whose letters to investors discuss “treasures” and “shipwrecks” accompanied by matching pictures, suffered a mutiny of talent and disappointing returns (5 percent through November for the flagship Jolly Roger fund). Investors not tipped off by the name perhaps should have been warned by a New York magazine article that featured one of the fund’s 27-year-old analysts, a former snowboarding champion, yelling at a chief executive that he was the boss. Capt. Jack Sparrow take heed.THE $100 MILLION WEEKEND AWARD On a Friday in November, a $13 billion fund, Atticus Management, owned or controlled through options 9.9 percent of Phelps Dodge. Two days later, when Freeport-McMoRan Copper and Gold announced that it would acquire Phelps, Atticus made over $510 million. That number understates the fund’s real return, which is based on its previously acquired stake, done when the stock was cheaper. Since hedge fund managers take 20 percent of the profits, Timothy Barakett, Atticus’s founder and lead manager, made more than $100 million. New television series: Who Wants to Be a Decamillionaire?THE HYPOCRITE’S AWARD For all the talk about wanting to be more open, a lot of you are still secretive.

"'06-12-29,'0','While recent signs have led some economists to speculate that the worst of the housing slump has passed, many, including those at the Realtors association, are taking a wait-and-see approach.“Maybe we’ve hit bottom,” Mr. Lereah said. “I’ll need another month before I can get comfortable with that statement.”Still, the back-to-back monthly increases in sales of previously owned homes, coupled with a report Wednesday showing a rise in sales of new homes in November, suggests to some economists that the housing decline is starting to stabilize.Gary Bigg, an economist with Bank of America, said in a research note that the housing reports from this week suggest “that housing demand has firmed, albeit at a lower level than in 2005.”The upturn last month in sales of previously owned homes was largely a result of a 6 percent rise in the Northeast that offset flat sales in the Midwest and a 1.6 percent decline in the South. Sales in the West rose 0.8 percent.Median prices declined in each region of the country, led by the Midwest, where it fell 3.5 percent, to $165,000, from a year earlier. Prices in the South fell 3.2 percent, to $179,000. In the Northeast, they were down 2.2 percent, at $269,000, and the West was down 0.8 percent, at $351,000.In the months ahead, selling off the huge supply of unsold homes will be crucial to determining whether the housing market will rebound, analysts said.In November, the time it would take to sell all the existing homes on the market fell to 7.3 months, down from 7.4 months in October. The October number represented the biggest backlog of single-family homes since May 1993.“We still need to clear a huge amount of inventory,” said David Kelly, an economist with Putnam Investments.While a decline in residential construction lopped more than one percentage point off the nation’s gross domestic product in the third quarter, strength in other areas of the economy has prevented the housing slowdown from becoming too much of a drag.“The encouraging sign is that the rest of the economy is O.K.,” Mr. Kelly said. “And we’re really running out of time for housing to hurt the rest of the economy.”Yesterday, a pair of economic reports suggested that the economy outside of housing is on sturdy footing.The Conference Board’s index of consumer confidence rose this month to the highest level since April. And a report on business activity in the Midwest showed an increase this month, according to the National Association of Purchasing Management-Chicago. Last month, the report showed a contraction in business activity for the region.'"
"'06-12-29,'0','THE basic question of whether it’s better to rent or buy your second home is one whose answer can always prove elusive, even in a healthy market. And that’s because it’s never solely a financial decision, but an emotional one, too.“I’ve been in this business for over 30 years and I still can’t answer that question,” said Kelsey Maréchal, an agent with Sotheby’s International Real Estate in Bridgehampton, N.Y. “It’s a function both of the market and, more important, people’s perceptions of the market. It’s pretty much up to the individual and their needs — which are either based on what their accountant told them, or on a lifelong desire.”Gregg Russo, owner of Atlantic Bay Sotheby’s International Realty in Provincetown and Truro, Mass., says much of it comes down to personality type.“The people who can afford to buy into these homes are buying into an idea and a feeling,” he said. “They want a place that’s familiar, year after year, and know their things are there. They are not renters.”These are the types of ideas potential renters and buyers should think about before making a decision, said David C. Hehman, chief executive of the second-home resource Escapehomes.com. Other big questions should revolve around potential use patterns for the home, and how realistic they may be.'"

The message urged the Taliban to “sacrifice” their lives and “never submit or accept defeat.” The statement, written in Pashto with an accompanying English translation, was received by The Associated Press in Pakistan in an e-mail message from the Taliban spokesman Muhammad Hanif.

"'06-12-30,'0','“I don’t think it has anything to do with his playing,” Thomas said. “It has everything to do with him fighting for himself — not accepting sympathy, but wanting to fight and prove and continue to play. Not giving in to feeling sorry for yourself.”Self-pity was a plague that afflicted the entire roster in November, Thomas said. They lost 11 of their first 16 games. They went 1-6 at Madison Square Garden. Everyone was booed at home, but especially Marbury.“We were all getting hammered pretty good,” Thomas said. “And every now and then, we’re still getting hammered pretty good. It depends on which day it is. You can either fight or you can be sympathetic towards yourself.”It may well be that Marbury chucked self-pity in favor of self-actualization. But Marbury is not prone to psychoanalysis, so he offered a more basic explanation for his re-emergence.“The game’s just coming to me more, that’s all,” he said after Friday’s morning shoot-around. “I’ve got the ball more, I’m more in a comfort zone of playing the style that I normally play.”The ball is in Marbury’s hands more in part because Steve Francis — his co-point guard — has been out nursing a sore knee. And the reserve guard Nate Robinson, who was averaging 20 minutes a game, has been serving a suspension for his part in the brawl.“I think now, by there not being that many guards, I’m able to stay in the game longer and have the ball more,” Marbury said.But Thomas has also quietly adjusted his offense, calling more pick-and-roll plays for Marbury while still retaining Curry as the first option on most possessions.“After everything had happened, it’s pretty much a different situation,” Marbury said, referring to his November struggles.At his low point, Marbury was benched for most of the second half in home losses to Houston and Chicago, on Nov. 20 and 25. In the Chicago loss, he failed to attempt a field goal, for the first time in his career. Postgame comments by Marbury and Thomas that night seemed to imply a rift, but since then there has been no apparent tension.Circumstances have helped push them back together. With a depleted roster, Thomas has been forced to play Marbury for longer stretches, which has apparently helped his rhythm and his mood.The Knicks spent November trying to establish Curry as their go-to scorer and trying to adjust to Thomas’s pass-and-cut offense. Marbury accepted the change, as uncomfortable as it was to give up the ball so soon in each possession. His turnovers were low and his playmaking was solid. But his scoring plunged, feeding the notion that Marbury, at 29 and in his 11th N.B.A. season, might be on the decline.Marbury scoffs at the notion, saying, “I just laugh, really.”If the past two weeks are any indication, the Knicks have found a way to get Curry and Marbury rolling simultaneously, which should bode well for their winning percentage.“It’s a balance now,” Marbury said. “I had to figure that out. But I think for myself, I was willing. I never really got caught up in not playing the way that I knew I was capable of playing, because I knew what we were trying to do, as far as trying to establish Eddy.”He added: “I felt like I was playing a different style, as far as not getting any turnovers, being able to run the offense and still be able to make plays — not scoring plays but just making basketball plays. I think now I’m able to do both.”Quentin Richardson, who spent the 2004-5 season with the Phoenix Suns, was not expected to play against his former team Friday night. Richardson has been coping with back spasms since Dec. 15, when he fell awkwardly in a game at Indiana. ... Mardy Collins completed his six-game suspension Friday night and is eligible to play Sunday afternoon against the Los Angeles Clippers. It was a flagrant foul by Collins, a rookie guard, that set off the brawl with Denver on Dec. 16. ... Nate Robinson is with the team but will not play on this five-game trip. His 10-game suspension stemming from the brawl runs through next Friday’s game at Seattle.'"
"'06-12-30,'0','After being sworn in, Mr. Spitzer will keep to a nearly unbroken schedule of public events. He and his wife, Silda Wall Spitzer, will hold a two-hour public reception at the governor’s mansion, while the concourse under Empire State Plaza will be the site of a culinary festival, as it was during Mr. Pataki’s inauguration. The day will end with a star-studded free concert at the Times Union Center, with the actor and comedian Jimmy Fallon as host.“We want the emphasis to be on celebrating this important day for the state, but doing so in a way that is slightly more subdued than in years past, and a greater emphasis on opening it to all New Yorkers and their families,” said Christine Anderson, a spokeswoman for Mr. Spitzer.Where Mr. Pataki’s inauguration was led by his top campaign fund-raiser, Mr. Spitzer’s will be run by Ms. Wall Spitzer and Michelle Paige Paterson, the wife of David A. Paterson, the lieutenant governor-elect.The money to pay for it will come from the roughly $5.5 million left over from Mr. Spitzer’s campaign for governor. (Other statewide elected officials may also contribute leftover campaign money to share the expense.) Mr. Spitzer pledged this month that he would conduct “absolutely no fund-raising” for the inaugural.The contrast between Mr. Pataki’s and Mr. Spitzer’s inauguration plans owes much to the contrasting political circumstances under which each man came to office.Mr. Pataki’s 1994 victory over Mario M. Cuomo, the three-term incumbent, was a major political upset, elevating Mr. Pataki, a formerly obscure state legislator from Westchester, into a hero of that year’s Republican revolution.“It was kind of Moses leading the Republicans out of the wilderness,” said Blair Horner, legislative director of the New York Public Interest Research Group. State Republicans were euphoric, and wanted a celebration to match their triumph.By contrast, Mr. Spitzer was being widely trumpeted as a future presidential contender even before his landslide victory in November. He enters office with a mandate for reforming the ethics of Albany, and is under considerable pressure to practice what he preaches.“I think that the administration is well aware that it is first impressions that count,” said George Arzt, a lobbyist and consultant who worked on Mr. Spitzer’s 1998 campaign for attorney general.“A lot of people are going to come up in order to feel out the administration, to figure out who they can meet, to see if they can set up a relationship with them,” he added. “But at the same time, there is a feeling of change — and you want to measure what that change is.”Several Albany lobbyists said they thought that the private receptions sometimes held by the city’s interest groups and trade associations, usually in Albany’s better hotels and restaurants, would be fewer and more restrained this year.“In terms of the way they are carrying themselves and dealing with the governor, everybody got the message that he is very serious about the appearances,” said Robert J. Bellafiore, a lobbyist who was press secretary to Mr. Pataki during and after the 1995 inauguration. (He described the fallout from Mr. Pataki’s inauguration as a “major headache.”) He added, “You’re not going to want to do anything that you think that the new governor might think is something he wouldn’t want to be a part of.”At any rate, neither Mr. Spitzer nor his senior staff will be attending any such parties during the inauguration, said Ms. Anderson, the spokeswoman. But the incoming administration will be slipping in at least one exclusive event before taking office: On New Year’s Eve, shortly before being sworn in, Mr. Paterson will be the host at an invitation-only reception at the Crowne Plaza Hotel in Albany for three new Democratic members of New York’s Congressional delegation. Campaign contributors will be among the invited guests, along with Democratic county leaders and elected officials.'"
"'06-12-30,'0','Some accounting experts questioned the company’s explanation of the part Mr. Jobs played in the grants.“It appears as if Jobs is playing the role of a monkey: See no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil,” said Lynn E. Turner, a former chief accountant at the Securities and Exchange Commission. “If he truly were fulfilling his role as C.E.O., it is highly questionable as to why he didn’t know about such poor management and oversight of the option granting process.”An Apple spokesman, Steve Dowling, said the company would have no comment beyond the report. Apple still faces investigations by the Justice Department and the S.E.C.Apple is perhaps the most high-profile company to be entangled in backdating problems, which became the year’s biggest financial scandal, and Mr. Jobs is the best-known business leader to be pulled into it to date. So far, the S.E.C. is looking at the practices of more than 120 companies, and the Justice Department and Internal Revenue Service are conducting separate investigations. Dozens of chief executives have been fired or forced out.Backdating involves retroactively setting a stock option’s grant price to a date when the stock price was lower in order to build in a profit. It is not necessarily illegal, but it can have serious accounting, tax and disclosure consequences and is generally frowned upon by corporate governance experts.The discussion of stock option practices in Apple’s report was mostly focused on the accounting implications, and it offered few details on the potential tax and disclosure issues. It also did not address what appear to have been lax controls at the company.Mr. Turner said it appeared that Apple had practiced “pick a date, any date” accounting. He added: “Their disclosures provide less than transparent reasons for why certain dates were picked.”The special committee that looked into the options practices included an outside director who was responsible for handing out some of the options during the period in question. Jerome B. York, an I.B.M. and Chrysler executive who served on Apple’s compensation committee from August 2001 through November 2002, was joined on the committee by Eric E. Schmidt, the chief executive of Google, and Al Gore, the former vice president, who served as chair of the group. Mr. York recused himself from the committee at times when he felt that his own actions were under scrutiny.The report points the finger at two former officers who are not named, but they are believed to be Nancy R. Heinen, Apple’s former general counsel who left the company in May, and Fred D. Anderson, the former chief financial officer and a former member of Apple’s board. Mr. Anderson left the company in 2004 to join an investment firm and left the board in October, the same day Apple released some details about its options investigation.Jerome Roth, a lawyer representing Mr. Anderson, said in a statement that his client was “disappointed to learn” that during part of his tenure at Apple, the company “was not strictly complying” with its option granting processes.Mr. Roth added that as chief financial officer, “Fred did not play any day-to-day role in the granting, reporting and accounting of stock options, and he was not involved in any knowing manipulation of the process.”Ms. Heinen and her lawyer, Cristina C. Arguedas, did not return phone calls seeking comment. Ms. Arguedas said earlier this week that Ms. Heinen had “a well-earned reputation over 20 years for honesty and integrity, and any rumors to the contrary are without foundation.”The Apple report focused new attention on two large option grants made to Mr. Jobs in 2000 and 2001. Mr. Jobs canceled all of those options in March 2003 after a steep decline in Apple’s stock.That same month, however, the company’s board awarded Mr. Jobs five million shares of restricted stock, worth almost $75 million, that would not fully vest until 2006. Apple has said that Mr. Jobs never financially benefited from the option awards, which potentially alleviates many of the tax issues surrounding any grants, but not the potential accounting and disclosure consequences.Apple investigators said a grant of options to buy 7.5 million shares was inaccurately recorded as having been approved at a special meeting of the Apple board on Oct. 19, 2001. The investigation revealed that there had been no meeting on that date. The terms of the grant were not finalized until Dec. 18, 2001, when Apple shares were trading $2.71 higher. Apple did not explain the discrepancy.The company said on Friday that it had taken a $20 million charge related to the improper grant, but investigators found there was no evidence that any current Apple executive was aware of the irregularity.Apple’s investigators did not find any problems with another 10 million options that Mr. Jobs received in January 2000, but that award, one of the biggest grants of all time, was somewhat unusual.Typically a board or compensation committee approves a chief executive’s stock option grant immediately after coming to an agreement on its terms. In this case, Apple’s investigators found that the board authorized granting Mr. Jobs up to 15 million stock options on Dec. 2, 1999, when the shares were trading at $110.19.The chief executive compensation committee “finalized the terms of the grant” on Jan. 12, 2000, the report said — when the stock was trading at $87.19, a six-week low. Then the committee waited six days before formally approving that price, even though the stock was trading at $103.94 at that time.“Normally the delay is about six minutes, not six days,” said Brian Foley, an independent compensation consultant in White Plains. “And if the formal committee vote or consent is delayed to a later date, the grant date is that later date.”The report, he added, “appears to attempt to skate around the critical issue of when the committee approved the grant, rather than face it head on.”An Apple news release dated Jan. 19, 2000, and filed with regulators provides a little more clarity. “Steve’s stock options were granted a week ago at the then-price, and will gain value only as Apple’s stock price rises,” noted an Apple board member at the time. The board member was Jerome B. York.'"
"'06-12-30,'0','BEIJING, Dec. 29 (AP) — A Beijing court has ordered the popular Chinese Web portal Sohu.com to pay $140,000 in damages for distributing Hollywood movies online without permission, the movie industry’s trade group said Friday.A subsidiary of Sohu.com must also publish an acknowledgment of wrongdoing, the Motion Picture Association said.A Sohu spokeswoman, Zhang Xin, said the company was aware of the ruling but had no comment.China is regarded as the world’s leading source of illegally copied movies, software and other goods, despite repeated government promises to stamp out the underground industry. The Motion Picture Association blames piracy in China for costing studios in the United States $244 million in lost box office revenues last year.The group says Chinese regulators are encouraging a market for pirated movies by allowing only a few dozen foreign titles a year for theatrical release. It said 5 of the 10 movies cited in its lawsuit against Sohu were not released theatrically in China.In a statement, the Motion Picture Association said it had 35 other lawsuits pending in Chinese courts charging movie piracy.The Motion Picture Association, based in Los Angeles, is the international arm of the Motion Picture Association of America.'"
"'06-12-30,'0','She has only recently started to walk without a cane. She is in pain if she sits for a while, and it also hurts to climb the stairs to her third-floor walk-up.Ms. Armstrong received workers’ compensation and disability pay, but her income dwindled by more then half and she fell behind on rent. In the middle of eviction proceedings, Ms. Armstrong applied for help from the Federation of Protestant Welfare Agencies, one of seven organizations supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund. In late 2003, shortly after she fell and started having immediate financial problems, she received $644 in Neediest Cases money for the back rent.Ms. Armstrong’s injury has left her unable to do the physical work required of a traffic enforcement agent. During her first year on disability, she applied to return to work in a desk job, but according to Ms. Armstrong, “The N.Y.P.D. didn’t want me back in a different capacity.”The family lives on $1,222 a month from workers’ compensation and Social Security disability. She receives $200 a month in food stamps. Rent on the three-bedroom apartment is $731, car insurance is $400 and the girls’ tutor is $280 a month.“I still worry about the rent,” she said. “I can manage with everything else. I sacrifice the money that I give the tutor.”Last December, Ms. Armstrong again approached the federation for help to pay back rent. The federation usually provides one-time emergency assistance, but made an exception for Ms. Armstrong.“She had struggled to keep things up,” said Laura DeMaio, a social worker at the federation. Ms. Armstrong received $1,500 of Neediest Cases money for rent she owed.“It really makes a difference,” Ms. Armstrong said. “That is the worst thing that a person could really be in fear of. Not even homeless, just not being able to make ends meet.”A year later, Ms. Armstrong again has fallen behind on her rent and owes $1,000. However, she recently started receiving a housing subsidy from the Administration for Children’s Services for $300 a month. With that help, she was able to pay her November rent and $300 toward her owed balance last month.In the fall, Ms. Armstrong began studying mental health case management at Kingsborough Community College. She hopes that more skills will enable her to find work she can do.“I don’t know if I could physically,” she said, “but I know that I’m going to be trying. At least I’ll be productive.”She also wants to set an example for her daughters, saying that she will show them “if nothing else, that you’ve got to be productive.”The twins returned to the living room and reported that they had practiced their spelling words. Each girl read aloud an essay written with the tutor.Medina repeated fifth grade, but is more confident in the sixth grade. “Now I understand more things,” Medina said. “My fifth-grade teacher, she helped me a lot to make me understand how to do sixth-grade work.”Last summer, Ms. Armstrong, who also has a 21-year-old daughter who has two children of her own, started taking Medina, Nailah and Nabilah to family counseling at Catholic Charities, Diocese of Brooklyn and Queens, an agency that is also supported by Neediest Cases. She wants her children to stay in school. She wants “to break the cycle of promiscuity, teenage pregnancy. It’s a whole cycle that happens in economic situations such as these.”Ms. Armstrong wants her girls to know what she reminds herself of every day. “You are not your situation,” she said. “You are not your circumstances. It feels like forever, but it doesn’t last always.”'"
"'06-12-30,'0','Lalin said the dangerous nature of the competition might not deter sponsors who are more interested in the potential news media coverage than any return on investment. But he cautioned that those priorities could change if a representative was injured or killed.For the first time in 20 years, a sailor died during the Volvo Ocean Race in June. The Dutch bank ABN Amro, which sponsored the winning boat and the one that lost the sailor overboard, announced this fall that it would not have an entry in the next race.Despite the dwindling fleet, gear failures and storms that have added weeks to the first leg of the Velux 5 Oceans race, event sponsors said they were receiving a positive return on their investment.“This is not a race where everyone will finish,” Michael Rasmussen, the chief marketing officer of the Velux Group, the lead sponsor of the event, said in a telephone interview from Denmark this week. “We asked ourselves, ‘What if nobody finished?’ There is that risk. But this is something we had expected. This is really the ultimate solo challenge.”Velux, a manufacturer of skylights that is based in Denmark, forged a partnership with the solo ocean race after searching for a sporting event that could garner global exposure and fit with its core values.Rasmussen said his company initially had concerns about the extreme nature of the event, but he said he believed that Clipper Ventures, the company that operates the race, “has a crisis operation that makes this as safe as it could be.”In the 25-year history of the event, two sailors have died.The first leg of the Velux race has been more dramatic than Rasmussen and even the most seasoned sailors had expected. Only days after the start in Bilbao in October, hurricane-strength winds forced more than half the fleet to seek cover and repair damaged boats and sails.Further into the race, in the wind-whipped Southern Ocean, the second- and third-place boats were forced from the race by the conditions. Mike Golding and Alex Thomson of Britain pulled out in November when Thomson abandoned his vessel — adorned with the Hugo Boss logo — after the ballast keel broke. Golding completed a daring rescue before his carbon-fiber mast buckled, forcing the men to seek refuge in Cape Town.“It’s a yacht race, but it’s a battle with nature and yourself to survive this race,” said David Adams, the race’s organizer, in a telephone interview from Australia. “Now we’ve got the slower guys that have one-third the budgets still doing the mental battle every day. This human endeavor is magnified when it’s just one person.”Some sailors, like Golding, have fixed sponsorships, meaning the sponsor pays the yachtsman a set amount and is not responsible for any additional expenses. In a telephone interview from Australia, Golding said his eight-year contract with Ecover, an environmental cleaning product company, had an annual budget of about $2 million.“The breakage of my mast only affects publicity; it doesn’t cost them more,” said Golding, who chose to drop out of the race rather than have the mast repaired. “It has more effect on my business. It’s all about budgeting and forecasting.”Golding said sponsors who pay for everything might be disgruntled when problems arise. If a mast breaks on every leg of the race, the sponsor must keep writing the checks, he said.The mishaps of the first leg of the Velux competition have helped give the race leader, Bernard Stamm of Switzerland, a comfortable lead of two days over Kojiro Shiraishi of Japan. The problems have also made Stamm, who reached Fremantle on Dec. 4, more cautious. The next leg, to Norfolk, Va., is even longer than the last, at about 14,000 nautical miles.“You can’t only sail safe,” Stamm said in a telephone interview from Australia. “Otherwise you’ll be left behind. I have to find a balance between racing and safety.”'"
"'06-12-30,'0','In 2001, after Mr. Kerik moved on to the Police Department, the Correction Department bought 20 more doors without realizing, a spokesman later said, that a dwindling inmate population throughout the late 1990s had resulted in a dwindling number of visitors. Fifteen of the doors were never put into service.That same year, Mr. Kerik’s team at the Police Department bought four more doors to stop anyone who might try to smuggle a weapon into Police Headquarters. But again, police officials later said, something was overlooked before the check was written: The large doors, they contend, were too heavy for the floor at 1 Police Plaza.And so 19 of the fire engine red doors, at a cost of $50,300 each, were mothballed on Rikers Island.Mr. Kerik left public office at the end of 2001 enjoying national attention from his conduct after the Sept. 11 attack and his best-selling memoir, “The Lost Son.” In May 2003 President Bush dispatched him to Iraq to help form a new national police force. Mr. Kerik returned four months later.Soon after, Mr. Kerik joined an advisory board of DataWorld Solutions Inc., a Long Island-based company that sold electronic cables and security products and was renamed Defense Technologies Systems Inc. before going dormant in 2005. Mr. Kerik was to be granted stock options and receive a commission on sales he generated, according to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing.The year after Mr. Kerik joined the advisory board, DataWorld announced it had obtained rights to distribute Georal doors. Mr. Kerik has previously said he had nothing to do with the arrangement. His lawyer, Joseph Tacopina, said yesterday, “There was a thorough investigation into the circumstances surrounding the purchase of these doors, and there was never any allegation of wrongdoing brought against Mr. Kerik. Furthermore, he didn’t have anything to do with authorizing the purchase of any of the doors.”During the summer of 2004, The Chief Leader, a weekly newspaper in the city that covers municipal labor issues, first revealed that the city had bought doors it did not need and could not use, at prices that seemed too high. The paper reported that John Picciano, Mr. Kerik’s chief of staff at both departments and by then a colleague at Rudolph W. Giuliani’s consulting firm, had authorized the purchase of the first 10 doors at the Correction Department.Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly launched an internal investigation into what his spokesman called the Kerik administration’s “warp speed” purchase of the doors.In response, Mr. Picciano suggested that Mr. Kelly could have used the doors to prevent the fatal shooting of a councilman at City Hall, Newsday reported.Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg weighed in, characterizing Mr. Picciano’s comment as “drivel,” according to Newsday.The quarrel did not dim Mr. Kerik’s star. He appeared that summer in campaign events with President Bush. And in late 2004, Mr. Kerik became, briefly, the president’s nominee to Homeland Security, but he withdrew his nomination as questions arose about his background in a number of news reports.Several agencies began investigating Mr. Kerik’s relationship with Interstate Industrial, a New Jersey construction company that investigators said was connected to organized crime, a charge the company has always denied. He pleaded guilty last summer to two misdemeanors, including accepting $165,000 in renovation work at his former Bronx apartment from “the Interstate companies or a subsidiary.”Meanwhile, the city tried to auction off the doors. One auction brought a high bid of $21,600 for all 19. But that bidder backed out, as did the winner of another auction. A third auction again failed to generate a final sale. But it did produce two arrests.The winner, the Integrated Security Corporation, bid $35,000 for all 19 doors. But authorities say that bid was secretly backed by Alan J. Risi, the owner of Georal, which charged the city about $950,000 when it made them.Both Integrated and Georal submitted bids from the same Queens address and asserted that the companies were not connected, according to the city’s Department of Investigation. Mr. Risi and Joanne Ruscillo, under whose name the Integrated bid was filed, were charged in October with offering a false instrument for filing, a felony. The two are awaiting trial.City investigators alleged that Mr. Risi and Ms. Ruscillo went to great lengths to hide Mr. Risi’s involvement, including having her cash checks from him to buy money orders she submitted as a deposit with the bid. But Mr. Risi’s lawyer, John J. Budnick, denied that any fraud had taken place, saying Georal had gone out of business after submitting its bid and that “Integrated is basically now running the show.”In an interview, Mr. Risi accused the city of conducting “a sad witch hunt,” saying the doors have an encrypted computer system that allows only him to service them. He suggested that the accusations against him were a result of a mistaken perception that a special relationship among himself and Mr. Kerik and Mr. Picciano led to the purchases, which he called “stupid.”He added that the doors have been installed at government and corporate buildings around the world without their weight ever being an issue.After the failed auctions, the Department of Investigation asked other law enforcement agencies whether they might have a need for 19 free security doors.The State Department’s Bureau of Diplomatic Security accepted the offer for its Antiterrorism Assistance program, which helps civilian and government security forces in friendly nations combat terrorism. The doors were recently trucked to a warehouse in Virginia, where they are being prepared for shipment to locations abroad, said Brian Leventhal, a State Department spokesman. Due to the nature of the war on terror, he said, he could not reveal their final destinations.'"
"'06-12-30,'0','Ranchers in Dawson, Garfield and McCone Counties who saw the animal say they have no doubt it was a wolf, and they suspect it migrated hundreds of miles from large wolf populations in the Yellowstone region or in Canada.It is not just a question of taxonomy. If the animal is a wolf, the ranchers could be paid tens of thousands of dollars by conservationists for their losses. If it is a dog or a hybrid, they are probably not eligible for reimbursement.Federal trappers first assumed the animal was a feral dog because a wolf has not been seen in this area since the early 1920s. The animal also attacked and wounded the sheep in many places, which is characteristic of dogs, not wolves.“Wolves are like trained martial arts experts — they kill big animals for a living and know how to do it very quickly,” Mr. Bangs said. “A dog doesn’t have a clue but wants to try, and they attack all over.”At 105 pounds, however, the animal was much larger than a dog, closer to the size of the gray wolves that inhabit the Northern Rockies. Yet the feet were small, and the face pointed, uncharacteristic of wolves. The gray-and-cream-colored fur, with flecks of orange, was also unusual. Western wolves are usually gray or white, but never brown.Tests have shown some similarity to coyote DNA but have been inconclusive. State officials say they are waiting for more DNA testing before making a determination. It could be a number of things: a wolf-dog cross; a very unusual hybrid of a gray wolf and a coyote; a coydog, a coyote-dog cross; or a wolf from Minnesota or Wisconsin.A state biologist who picked up the carcass of the animal said he believed it was a pet because of its teeth.“The teeth were perfect,” said the biologist, Jon Trapp, a wolf management specialist for the Montana Department of Fish, Wildlife and Parks. “Not even a chip. And there was tartar buildup.” Wolves often have broken teeth and no tartar because they chew up bones.Ranchers who experienced losses are skeptical of the talk of hybrids. “There’s no doubt it was a wolf,” said Jim Whiteside, a rancher near Jordan, Mont. “It’s a matter of trying to evade the burden of damage.”Mr. Whiteside said the animal attacked 60 or so of his sheep and killed 21 ewes. “I doctored the 40 that survived,” he said. “The pattern was similar. They were all bitten in the right side of the rear end.”Ranchers believe as many as 200 sheep were killed. Mr. Steuber, of the Wildlife Services, said his agency had verified 58 killed. “But it’s possible a lot more sheep were killed or injured,” he said.There is a chance that all tests may be inconclusive.“There might not be closure there,” said Carolyn Sime, the statewide wolf coordinator for Montana. “That’s unfortunate.”'"
"'06-12-30,'0','LA GRAVE, France, Dec. 29 — The Col du Lautaret, a mountain pass that reaches 6,752 feet, is an hour’s drive from Grenoble and sits in the heart of the Southern Alps under the imposing shadow of big peaks and vertical glaciers. It is home to an annual early-winter festival, the Snowkite Masters, which brings together hundreds to participate in this emerging sport, which mixes skiing, snowboarding, kiting and kiteboarding, with a bit of skateboarding, wakeboarding and parasailing thrown in.Using lightweight foil-type kites that have bellows that inflate with the wind and give impressive lift and power, snowkiters are pulled across, up and over snow-covered hills, mountains, fields and frozen lakes.Upon my arrival at the mountain pass, known locally as the Col, I walked in knee-deep snow toward a distant, shimmering flotilla of colorful snowkites flying against a deep winter sky. The kites, some as large as a motor home, zipped about the sky in graceful arcs. When hit by sudden gusts, the kites slashed furiously back and forth through the air. Then, without warning, a snowkiter passed silently 30 feet above me, connected to his kite by 100-foot strings.He looked like an oversized marionette, except for the dreadlocks coming from under his helmet and the hand-rolled cigarette dangling from his grinning mouth.Snowkiting became popular in Europe in the mid-1990s, and the Col quickly gained cult status.“Here we have consistent wind, varied terrain and easy road access,” Xavier Petit, a local snowkiter, said in French. “And the Col is next door to big resorts, where many good skiers and snowboarders live. It’s not the easiest place to kite, but it’s popular because of media attention and all the crazy riders who live near here.”This year’s Snowkite Masters included participants from around the world. The staging area included a teepee and a sports-drink company’s promotional tent, with a D.J. spinning reggae music for a crowd that was huddling around a snow-pit barbecue and drinking beer.“We are an anticontest, with no fees, rules, competitions or prizes,” said Guillaume Chastagnol, one of the event’s organizers and perhaps the sport’s best-known professional. “Yet we still attract the world’s top snowkiters who travel here from far away to meet friends, test new equipment and show off new tricks. And, yes, we have very good fiestas.”Pascal Joubert earned his nickname, Big Air, because of his huge jumps, which last as long as five minutes at heights of more than 300 feet. Jumps are measured in time, not distance. He said he converted to snowkiting 10 years ago when he grew tired of fighting for fresh powder at nearby resorts.'"
"'06-12-30,'0','“Charitable giving over all has become increasingly sophisticated, so more has to be done than just pass the plate,” said Mr. Stone, whose group advocates calculating tithes on the basis of not only income but also total assets like home equity and investment portfolios.The changes in how tithing is done, some experts say, have been abetted by Americans’ growing familiarity with handling their own financial assets. New Covenant Funds, a family of mutual funds that invest with Presbyterian principles as a guide, has a systematic withdrawal plan so that tithes can be automatically wired to a shareholder’s church or to the church’s own New Covenant mutual fund account, if it has one.Mr. Norwood, his days placing dimes in the collection plate long behind him, was ordained a Presbyterian minister but now works as a principal at Capstone Advancement Partners, where he offers consultation to churches on how to increase giving by their congregants.He urges those churches to move toward creating tithing capabilities on Web sites that previously featured little more than schedules and devotionals. After working with Mr. Norwood, Sardis Presbyterian Church in Charlotte, N.C., now receives tithes through weekly online bank drafts from more than 15 percent of its congregants, said the Rev. Dr. Thomas Kort, senior pastor.“The notion that tithing is growing up,” said Eric Kessler, founding principal of Arabella Philanthropic Investment Advisors, “is exactly what is happening to philanthropy across the board.”One specialty of Mr. Kessler’s firm is working with clients to determine how much they should tithe, using an online survey as a starting point. In asking for goals and appraising financial suitability, the survey acts in much the same way as might an initial consultation with a financial adviser about college education savings.But beyond that, Mr. Kessler helps givers oversee specifically how the money is to be used, working with the donor and the church to reach agreement on whether it goes to religious education, for instance, or perhaps to building upkeep. He then tries to set benchmarks in order to measure how efficiently the donated money is being spent.“It doesn’t matter if they are giving $100 or $100 million,” he said. “People now want to make sure that their money is used well.”Such expertise is in demand, Mr. Kessler said, not only because of a variety of past financial scandals among churches and other charitable organizations, but also because of a sense among givers, particularly younger ones, that more influence and oversight garner better results.“They are applying their skills in business to their giving,” Mr. Kessler said. “They are treating tithing to the church in the same way as their financial investments.”Another reason to point the donation to specific objectives is that decisions on charitable giving are most often made by more than one member of a family. With different opinions to consider, blind contributions — like that dime for general purposes — do not always work.A number of church officials, including Dr. Kort, say that in giving up some of the traditional control to congregants and consultants, they gain increased interest — and donations — in exchange.For all of that, however, some age-old challenges remain.Deciding within a family what should be done with the money can be problematic, even for the consultants themselves.Mr. Kessler said he knew that all too well.“I am Jewish,” he said, “and my wife is Muslim. So you can imagine the talks we have when we sit down to figure out where we’d like our money to go.”'"
"'06-12-30,'0','Active-duty officers could not take a stand on such a controversial issue, but Mr. Cannon, prompted by Mr. Ford, sought out the next best thing: retired military officers. In time, the University of Michigan defense team recruited Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf, Gen. John M. Shalikashvili, Gen. Hugh Shelton, Adm. William J. Crowe Jr. and two dozen others eminences to sign a friend-of-the-court brief in support of affirmative action written by a Washington lawyer, Carter G. Phillips.The first case was argued at the court on April 1, 2003, less than two weeks after American and allied forces launched their invasion of Iraq. In this initial period, the war looked like a tremendous success; as a result, the military was held in especially high regard in the nation and at the court, and that attitude was reflected in the justices’ many questions about the brief by the military retirees.To the lawyer representing the plaintiff, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said, “May I call your attention in that regard to the brief that was filed on behalf of some retired military officers who said that to have an officer corps that includes minority members in any number, there is no way to do it other than to give not an overriding preference but a plus for race.”Justices Stevens, Anthony M. Kennedy, David H. Souter and Sandra Day O’Connor followed up with similar queries. When Theodore B. Olson, the solicitor general, who was expressing the Bush administration’s opposition to the Michigan program, rose to speak, Justice Stevens quickly interrupted: “Just let me get a question out, and you answer it at your convenience. I’d like you to comment on Carter Phillips’s brief. What is your view of the strength of that argument?”In the end, the court voted to uphold the affirmative action program at Michigan’s law school. Justice O’Connor’s opinion quoted Mr. Phillips’s brief at length and then, in an extraordinarily rare tribute, adopted its words as part of the court’s opinion: “To fulfill its mission, the military ‘must be selective in admissions for training and education for the officer corps, and it must train and educate a highly qualified, racially diverse officer corps in a racially diverse setting.’ ”The court, Justice O’Connor said, agreed with Mr. Phillips that “ ‘it requires only a small step from this analysis to conclude that our country’s other most selective institutions must remain both diverse and selective.’ ”In all, considering the statements at the oral argument and Justice O’Connor’s opinion, the submission from the retired officers, as set in motion by Mr. Ford, may have been the most influential amicus brief in the history of the Supreme Court.By Mr. Ford’s later years, as the Michigan affirmative action controversy illustrated, the former president had fallen out of step with the strong conservative drift of the Republican Party. But more important, the Michigan case, and Mr. Ford’s role in it, suggest that his views remained where they had long been — in the center of the country, politically and geographically — and by staying true to his beliefs, he left a quiet and powerful legacy for the university and the country that he loved.'"

Membership in the Ethics and Compliance Officer Association has more than doubled in the last three years.UNDERPAID C.E.O.’S? He is quick to acknowledge that the average chief executive of a large publicly traded company makes $10.5 million a year, about 300 times more than the average worker. Still, Dominic Basulto argues that C.E.O.’s are underpaid compared with top athletes, entertainers and, more to the point, the people who run hedge funds, private equity firms and investment banks.“Should we care? Yes. If other positions pay far more, then the best and the brightest minds will be drawn away from running major businesses to pursuits that may not be as socially useful — if not to the basketball court, then to money management,” he writes in The American, successor to The American Enterprise magazine. Mr. Basulto concedes that some corporate C.E.O. pay packages are “outrageous,” but adds, “even more outrageous is a system where Dr. Phil makes more than twice as much as Jeffrey Immelt, C.E.O. of G.E., the world’s most valuable company,” and continues, “ and where hedge fund managers who make the right bet on the yen-dollar relationship can take home 10 times as much as the head of the nation’s largest exporter.”It will be interesting to see how many shareholder resolutions are introduced next year to raise the chief executive’s pay.FINAL TAKE As if your pending credit card statement for all that holiday spending wasn’t awful enough, now consider the possible link between shopping and sin.A study by Daniel Hungerman of Notre Dame and Jonathan Gruber of M.I.T. found that “when states drop blue laws,” which ban Sunday commerce, “church attendance dipped by 15 percent among those who were going weekly,” Readers Digest reports.Churchgoers became as likely as nonattendees to use drugs and their rate of heavy drinking increased markedly.Mr. Hungerman’s take: “What you do Sunday morning could make a big difference in how you spend Saturday night.” PAUL B.

"'06-12-31,'0','Texas quarterback Colt McCoy threw two touchdown passes to tie a single-season record for freshmen and Texas rallied to defeat Iowa, 26-24, yesterday in the Alamo Bowl in San Antonio.McCoy had been cleared to play just a week earlier after sustaining a pinched nerve in his neck in each of the Longhorns’ past two games — both losses. He also ran 8 yards on fourth down to set up a 2-yard scoring run by Selvin Young early in the fourth quarter that proved to be the game winner.McCoy, a redshirt freshman, finished 26 for 40 for 308 yards. His 29 touchdown passes this season tied the N.C.A.A. freshman record set by Nevada’s David Neill in 1998.“I was just glad to be back,” McCoy said. “I had my confidence back.”Texas, the 2005 national champion, won at least 10 games for the sixth consecutive season.Drew Tate passed for 274 yards and 2 touchdowns, both to Andy Brodell, for the Hawkeyes.The Longhorns (10-3) were heavy favorites in front of an Alamo Bowl record crowd of 65,875 that was mostly a sea of burnt orange.

"'06-12-31,'0','Rights groups and some international lawyers have deplored the execution as hasty. Some said the execution, based on a comparatively small case involving the killing of 148 civilians, cut short Mr. Hussein’s second and far weightier trial for genocide, the gravest charge.“Such a rapid execution before the conclusion of the genocide trial is a serious legal setback and harms the credibility of the court,” said Antoine Garapon, director of the Institute for Advanced Legal Studies in Paris. He and some other lawyers argued that even if others were to stand trial for genocide against the Kurds in 1988, the person deemed most responsible would never face judgment.Many Kurds, in fact, say they have mixed feelings about his execution because it denies them the satisfaction of seeing Mr. Hussein face further evidence of genocide presented at the Kurdish trial, which was only a few weeks away from a conclusion.“To execute such a criminal, a man who reveled in his atrocities, is an act of justice,” Najmaldin Karim, president of the Washington Kurdish Institute and a former refugee from Mr. Hussein’s repression, wrote in an Op-Ed article published Saturday in The New York Times. “Sadly, however, we have not had full justice. Saddam Hussein did not confront the full horror of his crimes.”Mr. Hussein is the second notorious dictator to escape a verdict on genocide charges. The other is Slobodan Milosevic, the former president of Serbia, who died of a heart attack in March in a United Nations cell during his trial at the war crimes tribunal in The Hague.The best-known precedents for Mr. Hussein’s execution are the post-World War II trials carried out by the victorious Allied powers: the hangings of the military and political leaders of Nazi Germany and the war crimes trials in Tokyo of Japan’s wartime leadership.At that time, as now, debates raged over whether the trials conducted by victorious forces were morally wrong or whether they were politically and psychologically indispensable. Some argued that those trials of the late 1940s did more harm than good and should never have taken place. Winston Churchill, Britain’s wartime leader, had always urged that the Nazi leaders be executed, without trial.But since then, the Nuremberg trials, more so than the widely criticized Tokyo trials, have come to be regarded as the crucial precedents for trials involving grave human rights violations, specifically for the creation in 1993 of the first international tribunal, dealing with war crimes in the former Yugoslavia. “The Yugoslavia tribunal brought alive and gave meaning to criminal offenses that had been on the books for years, and led eventually to charges of crimes against humanity against Saddam Hussein,” Mr. Dicker said.Benjamin B. Ferencz, a former prosecutor at Nuremberg, said on his Web site on Saturday: “Whether a remorseless mass killer should be sentenced to death is a difficult question. There can never be a balance between the lives of a few mass murderers and the lives of their countless victims. Humanitarian law has moved away from imposing death as a penalty. It should be left to Iraqi judges to decide what is most appropriate to bring peace and reconciliation to their war-ravaged country.”In only a few other cases in the past half century has a political leader been tried and put to death under his country’s own laws. In 1979, the former Pakistani prime minister, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, overthrown in a military coup, was executed for the murder of a political opponent after a much-criticized trial.In December 1989, the ousted Romanian dictator, Nicolae Ceausescu, was executed after an anti-Communist uprising. But the rushed and secret trial preceding his killing by firing squad was widely seen as summary justice. Benito Mussolini was simply shot by Italian partisans in 1945 while trying to flee to Switzerland. Anastasio Somoza of Nicaragua was blown up in his car by Argentine guerrillas in 1980 while in exile in Paraguay. Laurent Kabila, the former Congo leader, was shot and killed by a palace guard.Only occasionally have former dictators been brought to trial in circumstances widely recognized as fair. During trials of former members of Argentine military juntas in 1985, five of the nine defendants were given long sentences in a civilian court but were pardoned a few years later. The former Rwandan prime minister, Jean Kambanda, pleaded guilty to genocide and was sentenced to life in prison by the United Nations war-crimes tribunal for Rwanda.Manuel Noriega of Panama was sentenced to 40 years in prison for drug trafficking by an American court but was never judged for human rights or other abuses.More often, political leaders have escaped into exile and resisted extradition attempts. Jean-Claude Duvalier, the former president of Haiti, fled to France. Idi Amin of Uganda died in peace in Saudi Arabia. Pol Pot died in bed before the new Cambodian war crimes tribunal began its work. Fulgencio Batista fled Cuba and lived the rest of his life in Portugal, and Mobutu Sese Seko fled Zaire, now Congo, and died in Morocco.But it may become more difficult to hide for people responsible for atrocities, because more countries are willing to apply international law and to call for or execute international arrest warrants.Augusto Pinochet was arrested in Britain, although he was finally allowed to return to Chile for health reasons, where he died this month. Attempts to prosecute him followed him to his deathbed. Some aging leaders of the Khmer Rouge may finally be judged for the mass murder they inflicted on Cambodia.Efrain Rios Montt and several other former military leaders of Guatemala are wanted by a Spanish court on charges of genocide of the Indian population. Ethiopia's former ruler, Mengistu Haile Mariam, was found guilty of genocide this month after a trial in absentia. He is in Zimbabwe, protected by its government. These men are not expected to be brought before a court.Meanwhile, Charles Taylor, the former dictator of Liberia, is waiting in a cell in The Hague, where judges of the Special Court for Sierra Leone plan to start his war crimes trial in 2007.'"
"'06-12-31,'0','In August 2004, Niskayuna Development, a company controlled by Mr. Abbruzzese, was granted a warrant “in connection with its assistance in securing funding from the New York State Urban Development Corporation,” the private stock offering plan said. A copy of the 48-page memo, dated December 2005, was obtained by The New York Times.A stock warrant is a security that gives the holder the right to buy a company’s common stock at a set price for a certain period of time. In this instance, Mr. Abbruzzese paid $10,000 for the right to buy 85,423 shares at $4.80 a share, according to the plan. A warrant is valuable when a company’s stock is publicly traded and exceeds the share price stated in the warrant. Evident, founded in 2000, is not publicly traded.A lawyer for Evident said Saturday that there was nothing unusual about the stock warrant. “As with all start-up ventures, some people receive stock options commensurate with their risk and their willingness to actively seek and raise capital from additional sources,” said the lawyer, Daniel J. French.Mr. French, who is a former United States attorney for the Northern District of New York, which includes Syracuse and Albany, said, “Evident is actively cooperating with the government and has received assurances that it is neither a target nor the subject of an investigation and that the government does not wish to see Evident’s viability endangered or the jobs of its employees lost.”The Urban Development Corporation, also known as the Empire State Development Corporation, invested $400,000 in Evident on May 3, 2002, and $125,000 on Feb. 4, 2003, and owns shares in the company.Charles A. Gargano, the chairman of the corporation, said he did not know of any role Mr. Bruno may have played in its decision to invest in Evident. “I never received any calls or anything from Senator Bruno regarding that,” he said.A spokesman for Mr. Bruno, John E. McArdle, said on Saturday that the senator had “no involvement with or knowledge of” the stock warrant given to Mr. Abbruzzese.Using money that lawmakers set aside for pet projects, called member items, Mr. Bruno directed $500,000 in state money to Evident in 2002 and 2004. He was also instrumental in obtaining $2.5 million in state aid for a joint development project involving Evident and Russell Sage College in Troy.The offering plan does not mention the member items, but it does note that the company conditioned the vesting of the final part of the warrant on Evident’s signing a lease agreement for laboratory space at Russell Sage College. Officials broke ground on the $5 million project, to create an incubator at the college for nanotechnology businesses, in December 2005. Mr. McArdle said Evident first came to the senator’s attention through Alain E. Kaloyeros, who leads a nanotechnology center at the State University of New York at Albany, and then through the development corporation. He noted Evident had received state aid through Gov. George E. Pataki as well.“They have gotten hundreds of thousands of dollars from the State of New York, independent of what Senator Bruno did,” Mr. McArdle said.Stephen R. Coffey, a lawyer for Mr. Abbruzzese, did not respond to phone messages seeking comment.The document shows that Evident’s private stock offering was administered by Tejas Inc., a small publicly traded brokerage firm in Austin, Tex. Mr. Bruno personally invested in Tejas in 2005 and lost money on the investment. He has said he bought his Tejas shares after discussing it with Mr. Abbruzzese, whose financial advisory firm merged with Tejas months later.Mr. McArdle attributed Mr. Bruno’s support for Evident to fear that the company might leave New York for the Southwest. Mr. McArdle said the senator’s assistance to Evident was “no different from what we’ve done over and over again and will continue to do in the future.”'"
"'06-12-31,'0','How close did New York City come to bankruptcy in 1975 after the Ford administration rebuffed its appeals for help? The margin between solvency and default may have been paper-thin.A statement by Mayor Abraham D. Beame was drafted and typed and ready to be released on Oct. 17, 1975, if the teachers’ union did not invest $150 million from its pension funds in city securities.“I have been advised by the comptroller that the City of New York has insufficient cash on hand to meet debt obligations due today,” the statement said. “This constitutes the default that we have struggled to avoid.”The statement, which pointedly invoked the comptroller, Harrison J. Goldin, a sometime Beame adversary, went on to say that the city had applied for and obtained a court order to preserve its assets from creditors.It said that “rational and humane” priorities had been approved to make payments in this order: police, fire, sanitation and public health services; food and shelter for people dependent on the city; hospital and emergency medical care for those with no other resources; bills from vendors of essential goods and services; school maintenance; interest on city debt; and payments due the retired and aged, beyond those from pension funds.'"
"'06-12-31,'0','For those Arabs who celebrated America’s embrace of the rule of law, the quick execution, coming before the conclusion of other trials against Mr. Hussein for crimes against humanity, left a bitter taste of stolen justice. Even Mr. Hussein’s staunchest enemies expressed a sense of bitterness at the end.“It is evident that they were not after justice,” said Hilal Khashan, a political science professor at the American University of Beirut. “It was a political decision, because as soon as they got a sentence on him they executed him. What mattered was his death rather than finding justice.”For those distrustful or disdainful of American intentions, the notion that the execution fell on Id al-Adha, one of the most sacred holidays of the year, seemed to symbolize the triumph of vengeance over justice.“It looks like they just wanted to take revenge in a vulgar way; that was their gift to the Shia for the feast,” said Khalid al-Dakhil, assistant professor of political sociology at King Saud University in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, referring to Shiites, who were oppressed under Mr. Hussein and now control Iraq.“Bush and al-Maliki thought they could benefit from this, but this is going to backfire,” he added, referring to President Bush and Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki of Iraq. “Saddam’s execution is going to feed sectarianism and contribute to more bloodshed.”Id al-Adha, the feast of the sacrifice, is ultimately a commemoration of the Prophet Abraham’s willingness to sacrifice his son Ishmael for God; instead he slaughtered a goat, and Muslims today slaughter goats, sheep and even camels to re-enact the event. As the blood of slaughtered sheep stained the streets of many Arab cities on Saturday, however, many found it hard to ignore the analogy of Mr. Hussein himself as a sacrificial lamb.“Executing the martyr Saddam Hussein on the first day of Adha in one of the holiest months of the year is meant to defy the feeling of Muslims, to invoke sectarian strife and to confirm that Bush’s policy as vindictive and aggressive,” said a statement by the union of the Islamist-dominated professional associations union in Amman, Jordan.“The phony slogans about freedom and democracy are fake,” the statement continued. “The professional associations mourn the death of the hero, the martyr Saddam Hussein, and stress that the day of liberating Iraq is near.”Even those who believed Mr. Hussein was guilty expressed doubts about his trial, and about whether Iraq’s rebuilt justice system was really the kind of civil institution that could support a true democracy.“Saddam Hussein was guilty a thousand times over, but still the Americans and the Iraqi government managed to run a shabby trial,” said Jihad al-Khazen, a columnist and former editor of the pan-Arab newspapers Al Hayat and Asharq al Awsat. “If they organized a fair trial with international observers that could have served as a model for other countries. Instead they messed it up, and I think Saddam in the eyes of many people will now be seen as another martyr.”Many in the region seemed to view the execution as a harbinger of further sectarian conflict. This was the first time in modern history that a Sunni dictator had been executed by a Shiite, some analysts noted, a symbolic step that was widely expected to incur Sunni retribution throughout the region. American embassies throughout the region warned citizens on Saturday to avoid protests and be prepared for unrest.'"
"'06-12-31,'0','ALTA, Utah, Dec. 30 (AP) — Every January when dog licenses come up for renewal in this ski town, dog lovers go wild with anticipation. They start counting the dogs that have died or moved away with their owners, hoping a few licenses will be available.To protect the alpine watershed, an ordinance here limits the number of dogs to 12 percent of the human population, with few exceptions. No canine visitors are allowed, even inside cars, and violators can go to jail.Alta occupies four square miles inside a national forest where an act of Congress left Salt Lake City in charge of the water supply. City and county officers police the canyons, keeping out nonresident and unlicensed dogs to curb bacterial contamination of streams and protect Salt Lake’s drinking water.For now, the town council keeps the lid at 42 licenses, even though it could add two more dogs under the formula tied to Alta’s population of 370.“It’s the worst issue I deal with,” said Mayor Tom Pollard, who can issue additional temporary licenses for good cause. “The day after I was elected I got my first call — I hadn’t even gotten to the job. They disguised it as a question about garbage service, then finished with, ‘Can I have a dog?’ ”'"

No bodies had been found, leaving more than 500 passengers unaccounted for.“We all just prayed as the waves got higher,” said Cholid, a passenger who had survived by clinging to wooden planks but had lost his 18-year-old daughter.People fought over life jackets as the boat capsized, sending cars crashing into one another in the cargo hold, he said.“I was going upstairs to try to help my daughter, but the ship suddenly broke up, and I was thrown out,” said Cholid, who like many Indonesians uses only one name. “I lost her.”'"
"'06-12-31,'0','Most vexing, especially for the government, is that the preliminary findings of the national survey, conducted in 2005-6, suggest that India’s share of malnourished children seems to have declined only modestly since the last national survey seven years ago.In Delhi, for instance, the share of underweight children dipped to 33 percent from 35 percent in that period. In perhaps the most damning indictment of the public health system, the share of Delhi children who were fully immunized actually fell to 63 percent from a level of 70 percent.During that period, the Indian economy soared.“I just want to assure you, government is very aware,” Montek Singh Ahluwalia, the deputy chairman of the Planning Commission said at a meeting of children’s rights advocates this month. “We must really judge our success in terms of these indicators, not in terms of growth.”Amartya Sen, the Nobel Prize-winning economist, said bluntly at the same gathering, “Our failure here is very extraordinary.”The rampant malnutrition occurs even though India has long had a surplus of food grains, and one of the largest child health and nutrition programs in the world. Public health experts say social practice and government neglect are more to blame.Deprivation starts with mothers: poor women, who are likely to be malnourished to begin with, tend to get insufficient food and rest during pregnancy. They give birth to underweight babies and often cannot produce enough breast milk.Millions of families, including their babies, survive on little more than rice, wheat and lentils. Poor sanitation, irregular immunization and a lack of access to primary health care can make already fragile children even more prone to falling ill and losing more weight.The child nutrition program, which is supposed to provide food rations and health counseling to mothers and children, has a checkered record, delivering high-quality meals in some places but dogged elsewhere by charges of corruption and mismanagement.A government panel this year recommended sweeping changes to the program, including serving cooked food to children and delivering rations at home for pregnant women and babies.In a rare rebuke, the Supreme Court of India this month ordered the government to expand swiftly the number of nutrition programs in the country. The programs now serve around 46 million children, at least on paper.The repercussions of child malnutrition, particularly in a country where 40 percent of the people are younger than 18, are obvious and far-reaching. It stunts mental and physical development and makes children additionally susceptible to illness.The World Bank this year put a price on malnutrition, saying that India lost up to $2.5 billion annually because of reduced productivity.The government has so far released data from the latest National Family Health Survey for 22 of the country’s 29 states, and it reveals, like most everything else here, a mixed picture. In India’s largest state, Uttar Pradesh in the north, 47 percent of children younger than 3 are clinically underweight. In central Madhya Pradesh, home to many of India’s indigenous tribes, the portion is a staggering 60 percent. In southern Tamil Nadu, the share has steadily dipped over the past decade to 33 percent.Because not all state information is released, no official figure is available yet on the latest nationwide malnutrition figure.An independent analysis by Jean Dreze, an economist and advocate for the expansion of the national child nutrition program, estimated that the national malnutrition rate was 42 percent, based on the population-weighted average of the 22 states where figures are available.That represents a slight decline from seven years ago when nearly 47 percent of children nationwide were found to be underweight.One morning in a destitute rural district called Barabanki about 300 miles northwest of here, a dozen small children, most of them barefoot, some of them barely clothed, lined up for help at a program known as Integrated Child Development Services.On this morning, every child received a scoop of dry cereal, a bland mixture of wheat, sugar and soy that is called panjiri in Hindi.Some brought a plastic bag to hold their gift. Others made a bowl with the dirty end of whatever they wore. They sat on the ground and shoveled the food into their mouths.Mothers in this village said the dry ration cereal sometimes made their children sick. No cooked food was available at this center. The center was also supposed to dispense vitamin-fortified oil to the villagers, but they said it rarely came.Child health workers assigned to the centers in Barabanki were infrequent visitors. One parent said she had not seen a health worker in her village in months, since the last distribution of polio vaccine. Immunization rates in this state are among the lowest anywhere in India. Fewer than one in four children are fully immunized, according to the latest health survey.An independent survey by Mr. Dreze and his team across six states in India concluded that, like the centers in Barabanki, most of the feeding programs had neither kitchens nor toilets. A third of them were described as being in “poor” or “very poor” shape.The best ones, the survey found, like those in southern Tamil Nadu state, served a variety of hot, freshly cooked food. Stubborn social divides in some parts of India meant that low-caste children or those from Muslim families were not served at all.Around the corner from one center in Barabanki, at the home of a toddler named Asma, who is almost 3, was a typical portrait of want.Asma’s mother, Alia Bano, said she had never had enough breast milk to feed Asma, the youngest of six children. She barely had money to buy milk, and with it, she made a pot of milky tea for the family each morning.The family’s daily meals consisted of lentils, with rice or whole wheat bread, and sometimes a vegetable. Fruit was too expensive. Asma’s mother could not recall when she last bought meat or eggs. The family lived off the earnings of Asma’s father, a day laborer. They owned no land.Asma waddled with a distended belly, a hallmark of malnutrition. Her mother said she frequently suffered from diarrhea and fever.A portrait of India’s afflictions of plenty is almost equally commonplace.Here in the nation’s capital, on a Saturday afternoon several months ago a teenager named Mansi Arya sat in a nutritionist’s clinic, recalling just how much she had eaten during her last round of school examinations.She would come home from class, persuade her mother to fry spiced bread known as parathas or open a packet of namkeen, the deep-fried spicy snacks that are the Indian equivalent of potato chips. She would plunk down with her books and study until dinner, eat and return to the books.At school, the canteen served all manner of hot fried delicacies, all of which Mansi ate with abandon. At birthday parties, there was the usual array of junk food and cakes. That year, when she was in the 10th grade, Mansi said she had gained close to 22 pounds.For nearly five months, with the help of nutrition counseling, Mansi dropped pounds. She gave up junk food. Her mother kept fruit on the dinner table. Her parents bought her a treadmill. The family gave up eating white bread and switched to healthful grains.Then, a few months ago, she entered the crunch of college entrance exams, the most serious in an Indian youngster’s life.Mansi confessed last week that her discipline had melted in the face of stress. She said she craves chocolates and spiced potato cutlets. She said she couldn’t remember when she was last on that treadmill.“With this tight schedule and so much of stress, I don’t like all that diet food,” she said. “I feel hungry when I eat that diet food, and I can’t study when I’m hungry.”A continuing study among Delhi teenagers by Anoop Misra, a doctor at the privately run Fortis Hospital here, found that the ranks of the obese had jumped sharply in the last two years alone, from 16 percent to nearly 29 percent.Mansi, now 16, swears she will get back on the diet after her exams next March. She says she wants to look good when she starts college next year.'"
"'06-12-31,'0','Robert Boehm, the chairman of the Center for Constitutional Rights, a Manhattan-based nonprofit group most recently in the forefront of an effort to secure legal rights for military prisoners held by the United States at Guantánamo and elsewhere, died on Tuesday at his home on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. He was 92.The death was announced by his family and by the center, of which he was a mainstay since its founding in 1966.The Center for Constitutional Rights, prompted by the civil-rights struggle, gained support after the assassination of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. in 1968. It was started by four lawyers — William M. Kunstler, Arthur Kinoy, Morton Stavis and Benjamin E. Smith — who maintained their private practices while volunteering their time for cases taken on by the center.Mr. Boehm helped rally financial backing for the organization as the center built its legal support network for the civil-rights movement. He also helped the center branch out to challenge American policies in Central America and assist victims of Gen. Augusto Pinochet in Chile and Ferdinand E. Marcos in the Philippines.He led the center’s legal team in litigation arising from the deadly Attica prison rioting in 1971. He also played an active role in many other organizations with liberal and leftist leanings.'"
"'06-12-31,'0','Art values have been escalating rapidly, particularly for contemporary works. And two high-profile accidents this year have called attention to the possibility that art and collectibles can be damaged. Stephen A. Wynn, the casino developer, accidentally put his elbow through a Picasso he had just sold for $139 million (killing the deal), and a guard dog in England mauled a valuable collection of teddy bears, including one that had been owned by Elvis Presley.The situation is further complicated by newcomers to collecting — and changes in the way collections are used.“Art is being looked at as the newest asset class,” said Elizabeth von Habsburg, president of Gurr Johns Masterson, appraisers and fine-art consultants. “Everyone seems to be collecting these days and different people seem to collect different things. Hedge funders are collecting primarily contemporary art and photographs. Russians are repatriating Russian works of art. Chinese are buying contemporary Chinese art and anything Imperial.”An increasing number of art owners are viewing their purchases as investments — and are putting them to work by lending them to galleries or museums with an eye toward enhancing their value.The value of some art has surged as much as 500 percent in the last two years, according to insurance brokers, so owners should consider whether their works are adequately covered.“Unfortunately, that’s kind of a full-time occupation these days, given the fact that prices are increasing so rapidly,” said William S. Ehrlich, a Manhattan real estate developer who has been collecting art for more than four decades. “We use an inventory system that allows us to keep track of things. When prices seem to ratchet up we will ask for updated appraisals from dealers or auction houses or such.”Mr. Ehrlich said he was finding greater scrutiny by insurance companies in documenting their exposure.“I just had an experience where something had gone up dramatically and we had to have it reinsured,” he said. “I submitted something from a dealer and they immediately questioned whether the dealer was a certified appraiser.”While those in the art world may be on top of what’s happening, owners of just a few pieces may not be checking whether they have enough insurance coverage.Brian Frasca, an insurance broker at the New England Brokerage Corporation in Greenwich, Conn., told of a new client who bought a work of art for a million dollars in 1991. The piece had been insured under a homeowner’s policy, which seemed adequate — providing about $2.5 million of property coverage. But the work was recently appraised at $10 million.Insurance companies typically request appraisals every one to three years on pieces valued at more than $75,000, but some collectors get appraisals every six months because of the market’s volatility, he said.There are many approaches to insuring fine art and collections, but a typical policy may now provide 150 percent of the insured value, to provide an inflation guard. The typical rate for such insurance is about $1.20 per $1,000 in value, according to several insurance brokers.Some owners balk, however, at keeping appraisals updated.“One of the most difficult things I have to deal with is trying to convince collectors they should get updated valuations,” said Dorit Straus, worldwide fine art manager for the Chubb Group of Insurance Companies.She said the reasons vary from not wanting to pay for the cost of appraisals, which can run $200 to $300 an hour or higher, to potentially increasing the amount of the premium. Insurers are also working with art owners to ensure that they are handling collections in a way that minimizes risk. A company, for example, may ask that professionals hang the art and double-check that it is placed in an area not subjected to smoke from a fireplace or light from a window.“We recently had one of our clients remove a washing machine from a third floor because it was above a $12 million painting,” Mr. Frasca said. “They didn’t even think about it.”One of the biggest risks involves art in transit. “As soon as it starts to move there’s a possibility it could be damaged,” said Jim Kane, president of Hub Personal Insurance in Philadelphia, which specializes in personal lines of insurance for high-net-worth individuals. “If you’re moving it around, you better let us know.”He said it was not uncommon for companies to require the use of professional packers when moving items, and he stressed the importance of insuring the art throughout shipment. If the work is being taken to a gallery for a show, for example, the owner needs to know at what point the gallery is assuming the risk.In some cases, owners have a hard time finding insurance coverage for shipment of their art. Jeff Lotman, chief executive of Global Icons, a brand licensing company in Los Angeles, once bought a collection of hundreds of key cels, plastic sheets containing images of characters used in the making of cartoons, from old Disney productions. He needed to move the cels from upstate New York to his home in Philadelphia during the winter.While his insurance company was willing to cover ground transit, he was afraid that changes in temperature would damage the cels. He decided to fly them back in a private plane, even though he could not get insurance coverage. “I just had to bite the bullet,” Mr. Lotman said.A much greater problem, insurance specialists said, is underinsurance on the part of collectors. “The problem is convincing people that anything is going to happen,” said Claire Marmion, director of art collection management at the AIG Private Client Group. “They don’t think the teddy bear will be eaten by the guard dog or that the elbow will go through the Picasso.”BUT anything can happen — sometimes where it may be least expected.Mr. Ehrlich, the collector, said he had lent a painting by Tim Rollins and K.O.S. (Kids of Survival), a New York-based arts program for disadvantaged youth, for a show at a major museum, which he declined to identify. The painting was destroyed when it was splashed with red wine during the opening, he said.“Why they would serve red wine at the opening and allow it to be served so close to the art defies explanation,” he said, adding that the work was insured and the claim pending.Mr. Ehrlich, who often lends out items in his collection, said he keeps his own policies in place when a work is out on loan and asks the borrowing institution to be the primary insurer while it is in its possession.Mr. Reed said that the damage to the Alex Haley documents had made him more attentive to the details of how they will be handled while they are out of his care in the future. The documents are actually owned by the Keeper of the Word Foundation, a nonprofit group that was formed by Mr. Reed. In the complaint that initiated the lawsuit, Francois Nabwangu, a lawyer for the foundation, accused museum officials of refusing to file an insurance claim for $168,000 worth of damage to the documents.According to the complaint, Mr. Reed had been named as a third-party beneficiary under the museum’s insurance policy, but the museum remained the named insured and was responsible for reimbursing the lender for loss or damage to the papers.Mr. Shreve, the lawyer for the museum, said: “The argument is there was some sunlight fading, and the papers can be enhanced fairly easily by a very reputable organization out of Chicago. Mr. Reed refuses to agree to that.”Mr. Reed maintains that “the restoration won’t correct the loss in value.” He said: “It’s like repairing a cavity. You get rid of the decay and fill the hole, but the tooth is never the same.”'"
"'06-12-31,'0','FULL disclosure: I have a serious soft spot for big American cars. No matter how much I revel in a nimble tango with an Audi TT or a Honda Fit, a well-done sedan in XXL always elicits a smile. Trouble is, there are few remaining objects for my affection; Ford’s Crown Victoria is the lone true-to-tradition holdout in the class.The revival of the rear-drive American sedan by DaimlerChrysler, first with the Chrysler 300 and later with the Dodge Charger, gave hope to full-size partisans. But for me it was the police package that elevated the Charger from good to great.A hunkered-down stance, backed by law-enforcement-only options like hefty 18-inch tires on painted steel wheels, commanding four-wheel disc brakes and a three-stage stability control system gave the car road prowess commensurate with its aggressive looks.Some of my affection for the police-ready Charger was a result of its piercing horn and brilliant light show; the Hemi engine didn’t hurt. either. (Oh, the prisoner barrier and hose-out interior — features that would have been useful when my daughters were younger — were neat, too.)While I don’t find the Charger’s styling especially attractive, I am grateful the car had enough attitude to distance it from the universe of generic four-doors. I doubt it was the best car I drove in ’06, but it was surely the most fun.Among a year’s worth of flings in vehicles of every description, the Charger was one car I could settle down with. If only civilians could buy all those police package treats.'"
"'06-12-31,'0','I applaud the fact that Verizon and AT&T are moving into the television business. Few companies have been able to create monopolies in their industries, but unfortunately the cable companies have been able to do just that.Research shows that less competition, in any industry, equals less incentive to have lower prices and better service.I hope that the arrival of the phone companies in the television business means that the competition will ease the burden of our cable bills and that more choices will lead to better service.It’s My Pension, and I Earned ItThe pensions of state workers are part of the social contract between the government and the people. It is not fair to renege on this obligation, especially when many New Jersey workers are making huge salaries.The fair way to fix the tax revenue shortfall is to raise the state income tax on those most able to pay. Public-sector workers are not the problem. Do not make them the scapegoat for legislators and governors who took the easy way in the past by under-funding the pension fund.'"
"'06-12-31,'0','The idea behind the future New Jersey Hall of Fame is well-meaning enough: to gather some positive recognition for a state whose attributes are too often overlooked. After all, a state where Albert Einstein, Toni Morrison and Bruce Springsteen lived a good portion of their lives has a lot going for it.But a New Jersey Hall of Fame without Paul Robeson, an early civil rights hero, is ignoring a major figure. What are people expected to believe of a state that ranks Frank Sinatra, a celebrity remembered for his general orneriness as much as for any contributions to the Garden State, as a leading resident but fails to honor Mr. Robeson?Mr. Robeson, the first black to play football at Rutgers and a two-time all American, graduated as valedictorian of his class in 1919. He received a law degree from Columbia but resigned from a prominent law firm after a white stenographer refused to take dictation from him. He went on to a career in theater and music promoting African-American culture, and was known for his rendition of “Old Man River” that moved listeners to tears.Later, he traveled the world to better the plight of the poor, no matter their color, and successfully resisted efforts during the McCarthy era to malign and silence him because of his civil rights activities.Earlier this month, a panel of authors, editors, professors and others nominated 25 notables with New Jersey ties who include Thomas Edison, Meryl Streep, Yogi Berra, Althea Gibson and F. Scott Fitzgerald. A spokesman said Mr. Robeson did not make the cut because he was nominated for too many categories and did not receive enough votes in any one of them.Inadvertent though it might be, that’s another injustice to Mr. Robeson.'"

"'06-12-31,'0','Thank you to James Schembari for his column about what to call people from Connecticut (“And Don’t Call Me a Connecticuter, Either,” Dec. 17). Being practical New Englanders, we have never acquiesced to being called anything at all by outsiders.In private we call each other many things, but never Connecticuters (especially with one T at the end, since that would imply the word was pronounced “cute” — and would really be rejectable). The prefix “Connecti- ” lends itself to many endings, not the least of which are “Connectikite,” “Connectiquois” and “Connectikook.”The change to a K is of course necessary, as it’s not easy to get a hard-C sound otherwise, economically. And we are nothing if not economical. In fact, since no one pronounces the second C anyhow, there is a movement afoot to expunge it.If people from Massachusetts can be called Bay Staters, how about us being called Sound Bounders?Or, how about Charter Oakers?My friends and I have used the Connetian term for years. It’s easy on the ears and has a hint of snobbishness to it.'"
"'06-12-31,'0','Once more, Artspace, a plucky alternative to traditional galleries and museums, presents us with what seems like a perversely irreverent exhibition. The show, “Don’t Know Much About History,” pokes gentle fun at the American public’s lack of general historical knowledge, aiming to set things right, sort of.Apparently, the 16 mostly young, contemporary artists included in the exhibition do know about history. Their works invite us to look, think and learn about the past and the ways it can teach us to live responsibly in the present.Those ignorant of history may be more than a touch mystified by the displays, so the thoughtful catalog written by the exhibition curator, Denise Markonish, is probably a good place for viewers to start. The artworks can be divided into categories, she explains: those that look at the relationship of art to history; that link historical events in various ways to the present; or that chart the way artworks reflect on time passing.The artists examining the relationship of art to history include Charles Browning, Titus Kaphar, Mary Dwyer and Lalla A. Essaydi. Mr. Browning and Mr. Kaphar quote from and reconfigure historical paintings by European and American artists to comment on the marginalization of people of African descent. Similarly, Ms. Essaydi looks at the ways in which Orientalism in art has affected the portrayal of non-Western people. Her paintings concoct pastiches of imagery of the exotic, erotic Far East from art history, a common Orientalist trope.More literally, Ms. Dwyer examines artwork as a means of documenting the lives of famous people, sharing details otherwise unknown or lost. Here she focuses on Paul Revere, with a series of delicate portrait paintings that trace his life from his early career as a silversmith to his fabled midnight ride of 1775, announcing the start of the Revolutionary War.'"
"'06-12-31,'0','It was with a sense of sadness that I read “How Do You Outgrow a 13-Foot Tree?,” by Michael Winerip (Parenting, Dec. 24). It was disconcerting to see the ease with which he abandoned his Jewish heritage (as he put it, “Before long Hanukkah disappeared. It was my doing”). He is equally unconcerned about the lack of any religious content to his family’s celebration of Christmas.From his descriptions, it appears that Christmas consists of the trappings and the wrappings — the tree, the decorations, the food and of course the presents. In fact it is the loss of these superficialities that Mr. Winerip bemoans. As an orthodox Jew I am saddened by the loss of Mr. Winerip from our mutual heritage and tradition, but I am equally saddened by the loss for his children from their own religious Christian legacy.Perhaps it’s not so odd but ironic that Mr. Winerip, the only Jewish member of his family, is the one to insist they still have a tree, while they celebrate Christmas break in the tropics. It would appear that even this small tradition is being abandoned. Children learn by example, and while tradition begets tradition its abandonment begets the same.Thank you for your editorial about New York State’s sexual violent predator legislation (“Rush to Judgment on Sex Offenders,” Dec. 10). The Senate’s bill was a “lock-’em-up and throw away the key” plan and the Assembly’s a defensive reaction to this. Either bill would have resulted in a financial disaster that would have had no impact on most sexual violence.The New York State Association for the Treatment of Sexual Abusers and the Alliance, representing professionals who manage sex offenders, for a year have suggested that the governor form a commission to thoroughly evaluate the experience of other states and countries with this legislation.'"
"'06-12-31,'0','Afterward, initiatives were undertaken to strengthen and diversify the economy, and in 2001 the Economic Development Commission was created.The commission offers companies a number of inducements, including a 90 percent exemption on local income taxes; a 90 percent exemption on dividends; a 100 percent exemption on gross receipts taxes; a 100 percent exemption on property taxes; a 100 percent exemption on excise taxes; and 1 percent customs duties. The creation of the commission was accompanied by an aggressive marketing campaign, which resulted in about 100 companies’ moving to or expanding on the islands between 2002 and 2004, employing nearly 3,100 people.“Of course there’s a trade-off,” said Nadine Marchena, the commission’s assistant chief executive. “In exchange for the benefits, we expect our companies to invest in the community. We ask them to buy locally, support regional charities and establish residency — anything that demonstrates an intention to stay.”The commission does not require the companies or their employees to buy real estate. But it did not take long for most of the newly imported chief executives to realize the tax benefits of buying.“They made it their business to know everything there was to know about the agency and its benefits,” Ms. Marchena said, “to the point where they were functioning as ambassadors for the E.D.C., telling their clients why it would be beneficial for them to buy this or that property.”The Virgin Islands housing market has changed dramatically since 2002. On St. Thomas, there are now 110 homes for sale, 44 of them listed for more than a $1 million. In 2006, 17 homes have sold for over $1 million, compared with one home that sold for $1.01 million in 2002.The St. John market has risen, too, because of a severely limited supply of housing: two-thirds of the island is a national park. And in St. Croix property values have also increased, though much less dramatically, because of its distance from the economic and tourism hub of St. Thomas and its less densely populated area.While the commission’s efforts attracted wealthy professionals, they also gained the attention of federal officials. In 2004, the United States Treasury Department concluded that the commission’s efforts were costing the federal government more than $1 billion a year in lost tax revenue. An investigation revealed a smattering of financial abuses coupled with lax residency requirements. The findings resulted in new residency rules, requiring all employees to be physically on the island for 183 days a year.“Enrollment in the E.D.C. program has been adversely affected,” said Nick Bailey, co-owner of John Foster Real Estate. “Several of the E.D.C. companies were audited or couldn’t meet the residency requirements, so they left. That put the brakes on the rapid, artificial inflation of the real estate market.”Those people who bought or built expensive luxury homes were not in a hurry to sell for less than what they considered these homes to be worth, which resulted in a glut of high-end properties.“The market has leveled off, but it isn’t going down,” said Dawn Wheatley, a broker with John Foster Real Estate, “and the reason is a limited supply of inventory. Almost no new housing has been built in more than 20 years, and we’re back to our original client base of second-home buyers from the U.S. The downside is that there are very few homes available in the under-$300,000 range.”“Even the average two-bedroom, two-bath condominium is going for between $400,000 and $700,000 now,” she added.Prospective home buyers with limited resources might hope for some break in the market. For now, though, the market is strong, and residents breathed a sigh of relief this year when a gentle hurricane season left all three islands intact.More than eight months after her relocation, Colleen Wilson has put house-hunting on the back burner. “We’re still ready to buy the right property for the right price,” she said. “But I don’t want a damaged place. Neither of us are particularly hands-on people.”Yet not everyone is complaining about the market here. Aaron Black, a developer with a company called Labal, says he is not concerned about the flat property values. Labal was founded by Mr. Black’s father, Gordon, who fashioned a viable business from a hobby of transforming hurricane-damaged properties into luxury homes and villas, then flipping them for a handsome profit.“Fortunately for us,” the younger Mr. Black said, “a key factor beyond the E.D.C. that sustained real estate values here was and continues to be an abundance of baby boomer wealth. Don’t forget, this is a generation that has been driven by their dreams and desires, and the kinds of properties we’ve been developing are compatible with that common fantasy of escaping to a tropical paradise.”Neither of the men expressed concern about finding buyers for their two luxury properties on Frenchman’s Bay and Magens Bay, listed at $4.2 million and $2.5 million, respectively.“It’ll probably sell to someone from the States,” said Gordon Black, standing beside a new infinity pool on the deck of his recently finished 4,250-square-foot property, Villa Cote Sud, on Frenchman’s Bay. From there, a long staircase pauses at an outdoor shower before leading directly into some of the finest snorkeling grounds on the island. “It might not go as quickly as it would have a couple of years ago,” he said, “but we can always rent it out in the meantime.”'"
"'06-12-31,'0','And although that type of agency is common, it can also be confusing for clients. That is because while one broker in a firm may take a listing from a seller, other brokers — both in that firm and in others — will be working with buyers and showing them that listing and others. While the brokers working with the buyers might appear to be working on the buyers’ behalf, in reality — and legally — those brokers may still owe their undivided loyalty to the seller, even if the brokers or sales agents have never even met the seller.Mr. Garfinkle, the lawyer, said that with a buyer’s agency, the agent owes his or her undivided loyalty to the buyer. In fact, he said, for members of the Real Estate Board of New York, when a member broker or agent is representing a buyer who is interested in another member broker’s listing, that broker will act as a buyer’s agent and the seller’s broker will act as a seller’s agent.The third category is a dual agency. In this role, Mr. Garfinkle said, the broker or sales agent is explicitly representing both the buyer and seller, but just as explicitly cannot provide undivided loyalty to either. In fact, he said, an agent acting as a dual agent has an obligation to explain to both the buyer and the seller that he is acting on behalf of the other party as well.Another improvement on the new forms, Mr. Garfinkle said, is that they describe in detail a fairly common, but potentially confusing, type of agency known as dual agency with designated sales associates.“This occurs when you have a broker with a listing who has a buyer interested in that listing or other listings held by the company,” he said. In that case, if both the seller and buyer consent, the broker can designate one sales associate to represent the seller and another to represent the buyer.In this situation, he said, as with a dual agency, neither the seller’s nor buyer’s agent owes undivided loyalty to his or her client. At the same time, he said, each has an obligation to his or her client to exercise reasonable skill, act fairly and honestly and in good faith, and disclose any fact known to the agent that materially affects the value or desirability of the listing.Since many large firms have scores of offices and hundreds of sales associates, if not thousands, a dual agency with designated sales associates offers a reasonable amount of protection to both the buyer and the seller because each has a different agent in the negotiations.Mr. Garfinkle said that the fifth type of agency — broker’s agency — is, at present, somewhat poorly defined on the forms.“The forms allow a client to authorize an agent to engage other agents to work on the client’s behalf without the client being liable for the second agent’s conduct,” Mr. Garfinkle said. “If that sounds confusing, it is. We’re waiting for the Department of State to explain to us what that means.”'"
"'06-12-31,'0','Jonathan Friedan, Betty Friedan’s middle child (and my third cousin), spent much of August 1970 fighting forest fires in Washington State. When his backpack was stolen, the 17-year-old hitchhiked back to New York City. His mother divorced the year before and moved to an apartment on West 93rd Street. Jonathan happened to come home while she was in the final stage of planning a march down Fifth Avenue. “I had no idea what was going on,” he told me recently.The previous spring, Friedan decided she wanted to mark Aug. 26, 1970, the 50th anniversary of the constitutional ratification of women’s right to vote, with a major event to show that the promise of equality had not been achieved. She floated the idea at the fourth annual meeting of the National Organization for Women, which she had helped found. Her audience cringed, fearful of a flop.Friedan was determined to come up with a plan that would prove the doubters wrong. It wasn’t easy. In June, about 30 women showed up for the first strategy session for what they called the Women’s Strike for Equality. (To boost participation, the “strike” would take place at the end of the working day.) The planners sat in a circle, and the meeting was conducted without a leader — in other words, chaotically. Throughout the summer, factions sniped. “A younger band of radicals,” The New York Times Magazine reported three days before the event, “found Miss Friedan’s way of doing things ‘hopelessly bourgeois.’ And Miss Friedan’s older, more conservative faction countered by calling the younger women ‘crazies.’ ” Natalie Gittelson Lachman, a writer and Friedan’s close friend for more than 40 years, recalls “how afraid Betty was that the whole thing would fizzle.” But Friedan worked relentlessly to prevent that from happening.A day or two before the strike, family friends of the Friedans arrived from out of town for a visit to New York. Jonathan’s mother hadn’t asked him to go to the march. But the friends wanted him to take them. He agreed out of pity. “I’d seen the Charlie Chaplin movie where he marches down the street waving a flag with no one marching after him. I thought at least there’d be four of us,” he says.But once Jonathan got to Fifth Avenue, he couldn’t get anywhere near his mother. The street was teeming with people. When the march ended at Bryant Park, Jonathan climbed up on a wall so he could glimpse Friedan standing on a podium. She spoke to an audience in the tens of thousands. “This was the moment I realized who she was,” he says.'"
"'06-12-31,'0','The last thing you expect to find tucked into an 1882 government-sponsored geological study is stunning artwork. But there it is, in the “Atlas to Accompany the Tertiary History of the Grand Canyon District,” a lovingly rendered illustration of that landmark of the American West. Stretching two and a half feet wide and 18 inches high, the drawing depicts a small band of horsemen, barely discernible against the canyon’s vast depths.It is no coincidence that the work is currently enshrined in an exhibition honoring the Newark Public Library’s centennial as a depository of federal government documents. It happens to be a favorite of Laura Saurs, the regional depository librarian and the exhibition’s curator.“It’s just so spectacular — and unexpected,” Ms. Saurs said.The free exhibition, arranged in a series of glass cases amid 15-foot-high marble columns, is full of government-issue surprises. Since 1906, the library has accumulated more than two million documents, which must be maintained in perpetuity. The burden of stewardship intensified in 1963, when the library became a regional federal depository — one of 52 nationwide and the only one in New Jersey — mandated to store every book, pamphlet, report, brochure and, more recently, every floppy disk and CD-ROM distributed through the depository program. (Up to half the documents produced by the government are not distributed for various reasons, Ms. Saurs said.)“A Window to Your Government: An Exhibition Celebrating the Centennial of the Federal Documents Depository,” which runs through Jan. 13, just hints at the library’s government holdings. Yet it presents a wide-ranging and occasionally whimsical history of the United States, with New Jersey well represented.A 1942 text, “Winter Encampments of the Revolution,” displays an article, “A Soldier’s Christmas at Morristown in 1779,” recalling the Continental Army’s stay at Jockey Hollow in that brutal winter. A photo in a book about Thomas Edison, holder of 1,093 patents, shows him at his West Orange laboratory with perhaps his most famous invention, the projecting kinetoscope, also known as the movie projector.The exhibition recalls developments both high-minded and, well, not. There is a pamphlet from the February 1882 memorial service for President James Garfield, an invitation to the dedication of the Washington Monument in February 1885, and a 1913 report containing plans for the Lincoln Memorial. On the other hand, a display case labeled “Just for Fun” includes the booklet “Gobbledygook Has Gotta Go” (Interior Department, 1966), the “Military Publications Index of Blank Forms” (Department of the Army, 1971), and a printout of the cover of “Distinguishing Bolts from Screws” (Department of Homeland Security, 2006).'"
"'06-12-31,'0','This summer he published “This Is Your Brain on Music” (Dutton), a layperson’s guide to the emerging neuroscience of music. Dr. Levitin is an unusually deft interpreter, full of striking scientific trivia. For example we learn that babies begin life with synesthesia, the trippy confusion that makes people experience sounds as smells or tastes as colors. Or that the cerebellum, a part of the brain that helps govern movement, is also wired to the ears and produces some of our emotional responses to music. His experiments have even suggested that watching a musician perform affects brain chemistry differently from listening to a recording.Dr. Levitin is singular among music scientists for actually having come out of the music industry. Before getting his Ph.D. he spent 15 years as a record producer, working with artists ranging from the Blue Öyster Cult to Chris Isaak. While still in graduate school he helped Stevie Wonder assemble a best-of collection; in 1992 Dr. Levitin’s sensitive ears detected that MCA Records had accidentally used third-generation backup tapes to produce seven Steely Dan CDs, and he embarrassed the label by disclosing it in Billboard magazine. He has earned nine gold and platinum albums, which he tucks in corners of his lab, office and basement at home. “They look a little scary when you put them all in one place, so I spread them around,” he said.Martin Grant, the dean of science at McGill, compares Dr. Levitin’s split professional personality to that of Brian Greene, the pioneering string-theory scientist who also writes mass-market books. “Some people are good popularizers, and some are good scientists, but not usually both at once,” Dr. Grant said. “Dan’s actually cutting edge in his field.”Scientifically, Dr. Levitin’s colleagues credit him for focusing attention on how music affects our emotions, turf that wasn’t often covered by previous generations of psychoacousticians, who studied narrower questions about how the brain perceives musical sounds. “The questions he asks are very very musical, very concerned with the fact that music is an art that we interact with, not just a bunch of noises,” said Rita Aiello, an adjunct professor in the department of psychology at New York University.Ultimately, scientists say, his work offers a new way to unlock the mysteries of the brain: how memory works, how people with autism think, why our ancestors first picked up instruments and began to play, tens of thousands of years ago.DR. LEVITIN originally became interested in producing in 1981, when his band — a punk outfit called the Mortals — went into the recording studio. None of the other members were interested in the process, so he made all the decisions behind the board. “I actually became a producer because I saw the producers getting all the babes,” he said. “They were stealing them from the guitarists.” He dropped out of college to work with alternative bands.Producers, he noted, were able to notice impossibly fine gradations of quality in music. Many could identify by ear the type of amplifiers and recording tape used on an album.“So I started wondering: How was the brain able to do this?” Dr. Levitin said. “What’s going on there, and why are some people better than others? And why is music such an emotional experience?” He began sitting in on neuroscience classes at Stanford University.“Even back then, Dan was never satisfied with the simple answer,” said Howie Klein, a former president of Reprise and Sire Records. “He was always poking and prodding.”By the ’90s Dr. Levitin was disenchanted with the music industry. “When they’re dropping Van Morrison and Elvis Costello because they don’t sell enough records,” he said, “I knew it was time to move on.” Academic friends persuaded him to pursue a science degree. They bet that he would have good intuitions on how to design music experiments.They were right. Traditionally music psychologists relied on “simple melodies they’d written themselves,” Dr. Levitin said. What could that tell anyone about the true impact of powerful music?For his first experiment he came up with an elegant concept: He stopped people on the street and asked them to sing, entirely from memory, one of their favorite hit songs. The results were astonishingly accurate. Most people could hit the tempo of the original song within a four-percent margin of error, and two-thirds sang within a semitone of the original pitch, a level of accuracy that wouldn’t embarrass a pro.“When you played the recording of them singing alongside the actual recording of the original song, it sounded like they were singing along,” Dr. Levitin said.It was a remarkable feat. Most memories degrade and distort with time; why would pop music memories be so sharply encoded? Perhaps because music triggers the reward centers in our brains. In a study published last year Dr. Levitin and group of neuroscientists mapped out precisely how.Observing 13 subjects who listened to classical music while in an M.R.I. machine, the scientists found a cascade of brain-chemical activity. First the music triggered the forebrain, as it analyzed the structure and meaning of the tune. Then the nucleus accumbus and ventral tegmental area activated to release dopamine, a chemical that triggers the brain’s sense of reward.The cerebellum, an area normally associated with physical movement, reacted too, responding to what Dr. Levitin suspected was the brain’s predictions of where the song was going to go. As the brain internalizes the tempo, rhythm and emotional peaks of a song, the cerebellum begins reacting every time the song produces tension (that is, subtle deviations from its normal melody or tempo).“When we saw all this activity going on precisely in sync, in this order, we knew we had the smoking gun,” he said. “We’ve always known that music is good for improving your mood. But this showed precisely how it happens.”The subtlest reason that pop music is so flavorful to our brains is that it relies so strongly on timbre. Timbre is a peculiar blend of tones in any sound; it is why a tuba sounds so different from a flute even when they are playing the same melody in the same key. Popular performers or groups, Dr. Levitin argued, are pleasing not because of any particular virtuosity, but because they create an overall timbre that remains consistent from song to song. That quality explains why, for example, I could identify even a single note of Elton John’s “Benny and the Jets.”“Nobody else’s piano sounds quite like that,” he said, referring to Mr. John. “Pop musicians compose with timbre. Pitch and harmony are becoming less important.”Dr. Levitin dragged me over to a lab computer to show me what he was talking about. “Listen to this,” he said, and played an MP3. It was pretty awful: a poorly recorded, nasal-sounding British band performing, for some reason, a Spanish-themed ballad.Dr. Levitin grinned. “That,” he said, “is the original demo tape of the Beatles. It was rejected by every record company. And you can see why. To you and me it sounds terrible. But George Martin heard this and thought, ‘Oh yeah, I can imagine a multibillion-dollar industry built on this.’THE largest audience that Dr. Levitin has performed in front of was 1,000 people, when he played backup saxophone for Mel Tormé. Years of being onstage piqued Dr. Levitin’s interest in another aspect of musical experience: watching bands perform. Does the brain experience a live performance differently from a recorded one?To find out, he and Bradley Vines, a graduate student, devised an interesting experiment. They took two clarinet performances and played them for three groups of listeners: one that heard audio only; one that saw a video only; and one that had audio and video. As each group listened, participants used a slider to indicate how their level of tension was rising or falling.One rapid, complex passage caused tension in all groups, but less in the one watching and listening simultaneously. Why? Possibly, Dr. Levitin said, because of the performer’s body language: the clarinetist appeared to be relaxed even during that rapid-fire passage, and the audience picked up on his visual cues. The reverse was also true: when the clarinetist played in a subdued way but appeared animated, the people with only video felt more tension than those with only audio.In another, similar experiment the clarinetist fell silent for a few bars. This time the viewers watching the video maintained a higher level of excitement because they could see that he was gearing up to launch into a new passage. The audio-only listeners had no such visual cues, and they regarded the silence as much less exciting.This spring Dr. Levitin began an even more involved experiment to determine how much emotion is conveyed by live performers. In April he took participants in a Boston Symphony Orchestra concert — the conductor Keith Lockhart, five of the musicians and 15 audience members — and wired them with sensors to measure their state of arousal, including heart rate, body movements and muscle tension.At one point during the performance Mr. Lockhart swung his wrist with such force that a sensor attached to his cuff went flying off. Dr. Levitin’s team tried to reattach it with duct tape, until the conductor objected — “Did you just put duct tape on an Armani?” he asked — and lighter surgical tape was used instead.The point of the experiment is to determine whether the conductor creates noticeable changes in the emotional tenor of the performance. Dr. Levitin says he suspects there’s a domino effect: the conductor becomes particularly animated, transmits this to the orchestra and then to the audience, in a matter of seconds. Mr. Lockhart is skeptical. “As a conductor,” he said, “I’m a causatory force for music, but I’m not a causatory force for emotion.” But Dr. Levitin is still crunching the data.“It might not turn out to be like that,” he said, “But wouldn’t it be cool if it did?”Dr. Levitin’s work has occasionally undermined some cherished beliefs about music. For example recent years have seen an explosion of “Baby Mozart” videos and toys, based on the idea — popular since the ’80s — that musical and mathematical ability are inherently linked.But Dr. Levitin argued that this could not be true, based on his study of people with Williams syndrome, a genetic disorder that leaves people with low intelligence. Their peak mental capacities are typically those of young child, with no ability to calculate quantities. Dr. Levitin once asked a woman with Williams to hold up her hand for five seconds; she left it in the air for a minute and a half. “No concept of time at all,” he said, “and definitely no math.”Yet people with Williams possess unusually high levels of musical ability. One Williams boy Dr. Levitin met was so poorly coordinated he could not open the case to his clarinet. But once he was holding the instrument, his coordination problems vanished, and he could play fluidly. Music cannot be indispensably correlated with math, Dr. Levitin noted, if Williams people can play music. He is now working on a study that compares autistics — some of whom have excellent mathematical ability, but little musical ability — to people with Williams; in the long run, he said, he thinks it could help shed light on why autistic brains develop so differently.Not all of Dr. Levitin’s idea have been easily accepted. He argues, for example, that music is an evolutionary adaptation: something that men developed as a way to demonstrate reproductive fitness. (Before you laugh, consider the sex lives of today’s male rock stars.) Music also helped social groups cohere. “Music has got to be useful for survival, or we would have gotten rid of it years ago,” he said.But Steven Pinker, a cognitive scientist at Harvard known for his defense of evolutionary psychology, has publicly disparaged this idea. Dr. Pinker has called music “auditory cheesecake,” something pleasant but not evolutionarily nutritious. If it is a sexual signal for reproduction, then why, Dr. Pinker asked, does “a 60-year-old woman enjoy listening to classical music when she’s alone at home?” Dr. Levitin wrote an entire chapter refuting Dr. Pinker’s arguments; when I asked Dr. Pinker about Dr. Levitin’s book he said he hadn’t read it.Nonetheless Dr. Levitin plugs on, and sometimes still plugs in. He continues to perform music, doing several gigs a year with Diminished Faculties, a ragtag band composed entirely of professors and students at McGill. On a recent December afternoon members assembled in a campus ballroom to do a sound check for their performance that evening at a holiday party. Playing a blue Stratocaster, Dr. Levitin crooned the Chris Isaak song “Wicked Game.” “I’m not a great guitarist, and I’m not a great singer,” he said.But he is not bad, either, and still has those producer’s ears. When “Wicked Game” ended, the bass player began noodling idly, playing the first few notes of a song that seemed instantly familiar to all the younger students gathered. “That’s Nirvana, right?” Dr. Levitin said, cocking his head and squinting. “ ‘Come As You Are.’ I love that song.”'"
"'06-12-31,'0','Two more easyHotels, in the Earls Court and Victoria neighborhoods of London, will begin taking reservations as soon as February. Over the next five years, three more are planned in London, one in Budapest and another in Switzerland.For travelers who want a larger room and a restaurant, there is Premier Travel Inn, Britain’s biggest hotel chain, created in July 2004 when Whitbread P.L.C., owner of the Travel Inn chain, acquired Premier Lodge. Now, the company has more than 475 locations including roughly 30 hotels in London, more than 30 in Scotland, 8 in and around Cardiff and more than 40 in Greater Manchester. It has plans to open eight new hotels next year from Belfast, Ireland, to Bracknell, England.Each Premier Travel Inn (www.premiertravelinn.com) has a restaurant and bar, either as part of the hotel or adjacent to it. Rooms, most of which have king-sized beds, full bathrooms, and tea and coffee makers, start at £47 a night.Working with Hypnos, the British bedmaker that designs Queen Elizabeth’s beds, Premier Travel Inns overhauled its beds over the summer to offer new mattresses, a choice of pillows and white bed linens with purple throws. The chain promises to refund the cost of the room if a guest doesn’t get a good night’s sleep. An independent audit of each hotel is conducted at least twice a year to check for consistency and involves a “mystery sleeper” who tests for cleanliness, friendliness and comfort.Don’t expect these options to bring you any closer to the local culture. Rooms are typically cookie-cutter affairs. But as Tom Meyers, editor of Eurocheapo.com says, “Sometimes you just want a nice, clean, air-conditioned, reasonably priced room.”Eurocheapo recommends Ibis hotels (www.ibishotel.com), in several cities including Amsterdam, Copenhagen, Berlin, Munich and London. Ibis, one of the economy brands of Accor, the giant French hotel company, has 651 hotels in Europe, most of them in France and Germany. Rooms typically cost around 100 euros, $134, at $1.34 to the euro, a night, or less and are no-frills affairs. But the chain promises to solve any problem with a room in 15 minutes or let the customer stay free.For the style-conscious traveler willing to pay a bit more for a hotel with a cool bar scene and trendy rooms, two chains worth considering are Malmaison (www.malmaison.co.uk) and Hotel du Vin (www.hotelduvin.com), which are both owned and operated by Marylebone Warwick Balfour Group P.L.C.The chains were created separately in the 1990s from landmark buildings like churches and warehouses that were gutted and given new, stylish interiors behind the original facades. With average prices of £100 to £145, they offer high style at a reasonable cost.Malmaison, named after the Empress Josephine’s chateau on the outskirts of Paris, is now found in nine British cities. Its newest hotel, opening in Liverpool on Jan. 29, will have 128 rooms with high-speed Internet access and two suites with teak bathtubs, large flat-screen televisions and table-top soccer. Opening rate: £99 a night.Hotel du Vin puts more emphasis on the sybaritic. Food is cooked with local ingredients, and extensive wine lists include bottles at reasonable prices. Each of the chain’s eight hotels has suites with “party showers” that can fit up to 12 people. There is also bathside waiter service and walk-in humidors.DAKOTA (www.dakotahotels.co.uk) is a two-year old boutique hotel chain created by Ken McCulloch, the Scottish hotelier who also started Malmaison and is often credited with setting off the boutique hotel craze in Britain. The hub of a Dakota hotel is its restaurant, called the Bar & Grill, and these dining spots usually fill up so quickly with locals on weekends that guests are advised to make reservations well in advance.“Essentially, Dakota is a Bar & Grill with bedrooms, not a 92-bedroom hotel with a Bar & Grill,” said Kevin Farey, a spokesman.Rates range from £86 pounds a night at the Dakota Nottingham to £249 pounds for the top rooms at the Dakota in Farnborough, England. There are no discounts. The rate you see is the rate you get.The growth in affordable options is particularly welcome relief for American travelers who have watched the value of their money plunge against European currencies. In mid-December, the dollar reached a 20-month low against the euro and was at a 14-year low against the pound.“I was in London just last week, and I paid $2.13 to convert to pounds,” said Jeff Max, chief executive of an e-commerce company, who travels there frequently. “It’s not unusual to go out and have a mediocre Indian or Chinese meal in London now and spend $120. It’s shocking, shocking, shocking.”Lately, he has taken to staying at Malmaison because it offers “the quality and the style of a much more expensive line and brand at something more affordable.”'"
"'06-12-31,'0','Q. When I see big trucks caught in an intersection in a brownstone neighborhood with narrow streets, I wonder: Is there a limit on how big a truck is allowed in a residential neighborhood?A. There is, and it’s a complicated subject. The City Department of Transportation’s rules state that a single truck unit can be no longer than 35 feet, and tractor-trailers 55 feet. But that doesn’t mean that trucks of those lengths are allowed everywhere. In parts of Manhattan, for example, trucks longer than 33 feet must stay off certain streets at various times.The 23-page list of rules for trucks includes detailed requirements for each borough, like height limits and routes that must be used by trucks that are not picking up or delivering in the borough.In addition, even if a truck meets the length requirements, it must follow certain designated routes in each borough. In general, if a truck’s local stop is not on one of those designated truck routes, a driver must take the shortest path to and from his destination.The Killer Who Kept WatchQ. I was reading about the area known as the Deuce — the stretch of 42nd Street between Broadway and Eighth Avenue — and I came across a startling piece of information. Did the city really hire a convicted murderer to crack down on sleaze there during the 1970s and ’80s?'"
"'06-12-31,'0','Just to be on the safe side, Barber carried Manning and the Giants into the playoffs, shredding the Redskins for a franchise-record 234 yards rushing and 3 touchdowns, including a decisive 50-yard run after the Redskins had crept within 27-21, creating ominous visions of the fourth-quarter collapse in Tennessee.“Thank you, thank you,” Manning told him when they passed in the interview room.“Obviously he was not going down,” Coughlin said appreciatively of Barber, one of his most vocal critics the past two years.While the Giants appear good to go next week to Philadelphia or Dallas, it’s also fair to ask what a second straight one-game postseason would mean for the future? Do they take it on faith that Accorsi’s 2004 draft machinations to land Manning, brother of Peyton, son of Archie, will eventually be worth the price that was paid?Manning managed last night’s game well enough, and threw a 6-yard touchdown pass to Tim Carter in the third quarter, but how many visions of a quarterback confused and overwhelmed will be endured before even the tiniest crack appears in the organizational Big Blueprint for success? How long does the quarterback of the future receive the present-day benefit of the doubt, with no viable reserve to give boy wonder a healthy, competitive push?That is the first question the Giants’ owners, John Mara and Steve Tisch, should ask their prospective replacements for Accorsi. Would the top in-house candidate, said to be Jerry Reese, the director of player personnel, be capable of cutting ties with the outgoing boss’s signature career move?In the grand Mara tradition, the Giants have generally done business in their own clannish way, and without much scrutiny, compared with the way other sports organizations are covered and criticized in the New York area. But there is a strong case to be made for them to go outside the organization now, to ensure a cool-headed, detached assessment of Coughlin (a favorite of the late Wellington Mara) now and perhaps Manning later.Manning turns 26 on Wednesday and will apparently make the playoffs in both full seasons as a starter. He’s had his days, his triumphant two-minute drills. But the wide-ranging optimism has been deflated, if not defeated, by too many poor reads, by a blur of bad throws.This season began for Manning with the faceoff against his brother and the Colts, with 247 passing yards and 2 touchdowns and with Peyton declaring that Eli is “going to be a great player in this league for a long time.” The Giants won six of seven, but then came the reverse, the run of horror shows in Jacksonville and Tennessee, and at home against the Eagles and Saints.The collapse of more serious Super Bowl aspirations wasn’t all about Manning. Far from it. But he is the quarterback, the heralded savior and, as Barber said earlier this week, “This is a cold, callous business.”Barber had enough left in the tank last night to remind the Giants of what they’ll be losing when he’s gone, and probably too much pride to go out with a whimper, especially after chilly questions about his focus and commitment. Now Barber can wish for an improbable run, the kind the Knicks embarked on after narrowly qualifying for the playoffs in 1999 before beating their blood rivals in Miami on the way to the N.B.A. finals.Can the Giants survive in Philadelphia or Dallas — two places where they have already won this season — and save Coughlin’s job the way the Knicks spared Jeff Van Gundy’s seven years ago?Do they want to? That’s besides the point, given the circumstances they are all operating under, especially Barber, who wanted to know why the Giants, injuries notwithstanding, weren’t capable of getting on a roll in the conference of dreamers?“If you don’t believe, that’s halfway to failure,” he said.Barber has also been around long enough to appreciate the odds of a long run to retirement. He had to know that so many of these Giants needed to win last night for their future beyond next week or even the week after.Only next year, Manning and company will face the unenviable task of surviving without him.'"
"'06-12-31,'0','Seller financing is similar to a conventional mortgage, though sellers can finance part or all of the sale price, and the interest charged can be lower than the market rate, as is typical when a seller is conveying the house to a family member, or higher than the market rate, for buyers who cannot qualify for conventional financing.With partial financing, buyers arrange for a first mortgage as they would with any conventional purchase.Whatever the amount the sellers finance, they assume the role of a bank, checking credit history, determining the interest rate and drafting a mortgage agreement. The sellers bear responsibility for monthly bill collections, and must also take legal action if buyers are delinquent.But if the seller is in the second lien position, meaning behind the conventional lender, the risks can be greater. “You’re taking the chance that you’re going to get your money out of the buyer,” said James Rice, a mortgage broker in Janesville, Wis. “It’s a risk, but in some areas where you might have problems selling properties, you either do that, or you won’t be able to sell at all.”Sellers who offer 100 percent of the financing can spare themselves the trouble of servicing the loan by contracting with an outside company to help. For example, CircleLending, based in Boston, services loans for $9 a month, which includes levying late-payment penalties and arranging for loan restructuring for delinquent borrowers.Asheesh Advani, CircleLending’s chief executive, said that half of the company’s deals involve one relative lending to another. “They’ll typically charge 2 percent below the market rate,” Mr. Advani said.There are also tax benefits, he said. In the sale of a vacation home, for instance, rather than realizing a one-time profit with a large capital-gain tax, the owner could finance the sale himself and thereby spread out the profit over the lifetime of the loan.Last year, Kay Sullivan, a retired executive search consultant in Tucson, lent a buyer nearly all of the $25,000 needed to buy her small vacation cabin in West Virginia, charging 10 percent interest over 10 years.She uses CircleLending “as insulation,” she said, so she does not have to become too involved with collecting payments.But the financial risk with this deal is small, Ms. Sullivan noted. “If it were my primary residence, I don’t know if I’d have done it,” she said. “I’d have to do a pretty good reference check.”'"
"'06-12-31,'0','Schools and hospitals like Beth Israel Medical Center and the Hospital for Joint Diseases dominate the landscape east of Second Avenue and dwarf some of the town houses along surrounding blocks. But the residential, educational and medical communities seem to coexist harmoniously, according to Lyle Frank, chairman of Community Board Six.“Having so many hospitals in the area brings challenges,” Mr. Frank said. (In fact, Stuyvesant Square is adjacent to a stretch of First Avenue sometimes referred to as Bedpan Alley.) “But we work with them to balance the needs of those hospitals with the needs of the residential community,” he said.As for the park itself, it has an eclecticism that used to be more pronounced when drug treatment clinics were part of the landscape, according to Carol Schachter, president of the Stuyvesant Park Neighborhood Association. She described a period in the 1980s in which “vagrants and angry, hostile people” were often found on its benches.But Mr. Diamante, who is originally from Brooklyn, likes seeing the men in three-piece suits sharing benches with people in more eclectic dress, surrounded by bags of stuff.“Walking through there is a snapshot of New York City,” he said.Mark Millhone, a writer, says he and his family will be moving in February to a three-bedroom, three-and-a-half bath condo overlooking the park. They look forward to the quiet of the new location, but also chose it for its convenience to Mr. Millhone’s office, and to Union Square and the East Village.“It’s at the nexus of so many great neighborhoods,” he said. “It’s close to everything, yet there is a sense of peace to it.”Rutherford Place, the nine-story building at 305 Second Avenue, was converted to a rental building from a hospital in the 1980s and is now being converted to condos. According to Richard Cantor, principal in Cantor Pecorella Inc., which is marketing the 122 units, prices start at just under $1 million and no two apartments are alike. Available units include a three-bedroom, three-bath with park views for $2.5 million, and a one-bedroom, one-bath for $1.195 million.Landmark 17, which is not far away at 233 East 17th, has only four condo units still available, according to Tamir Shemesh, executive vice president with Prudential Douglas Elliman. The Victorian Gothic building, a former convent, also served for a time as a Salvation Army shelter and the New York outpost of Hazelden, a rehabilitation facility based in Minnesota.One unit, offered at $4.95 million, has three bedrooms and three baths spread over four levels. The 3,500-square-foot apartment has one room with 23-foot-high stenciled ceilings. In the original building the room was a chapel; during the rehabilitation years, it was restored by the musician Eric Clapton.Some brokers see area town houses as a relative bargain. Barbara Godson, senior vice president at Halstead Property, has a renovated 6,600-square-foot house listed at $5.995 million that she says would be much pricier nearby. “A few blocks west,” she said, “it would be worth $5 million more.”Tim Desmond, senior vice president at Stribling and Associates, noted that some area town houses were lingering, but ascribed that to overpricing. “They are priced like the rest of the market,” he said, adding that buyers now expect to pay a little less for properties that far east. “I think the owners in the neighborhood have gotten a little carried away with their expectations,” he said.As for rentals, a two-bedroom in one of the small tenement-style buildings between First and Second Avenues will run about $1,800 a month. Mr. Shemesh says studios in doorman buildings start at $2,000 a month, while two-bedroom, two-bath units in doorman buildings start at $4,000. “There is a very low turnover,” he said.What to DoThe dog run, on the south side of the eastern half of Stuyvesant Square Park, bustles daily with unleashed animals and their owners. Hours run from about 7 a.m. to 9 a.m., when the area is reopened to the public, and again from 9 p.m. to 11 p.m., when the park shuts for the night. According to Andrew Kner, an art director who is a founder of the Stuyvesant Park Dog Owners Group, hours go a little later on Saturdays and Sundays, prime time for socializing among a very diverse group. “It is racially, socially and financially mixed — New York at its best,” said Mr. Kner, who has lived in the area since the 1960s. “People come from all over but the one thing we have in common is that we all have dogs.”On Second Avenue between 19th and 20th Streets, the 0.64-acre Augustus St. Gaudens playground is dog-free and reserved for children.Three blocks away on Union Square are the Farmer’s Market, stores like Trader Joe’s and Whole Foods, and major discounters like Circuit City, as well as a multiplex theater. Hipster haunts in the East Village are just across 14th Street, while Third Avenue has small retail shops and services. There are many attractions within walking distance of the area, said Mr. Diamante, who described it as “loaded with great restaurants and funky little shops.”The park was named for Peter (Petrus) Stuyvesant, the last director general of the Dutch colony of New Netherland, and was originally part of his 120-acre farm, or “bouwerie.” A great-grandson, Petrus S. Stuyvesant, began carving the area into buildable lots in 1789, but it was a great-great-grandson, Peter Gerard Stuyvesant, and his wife, Helen Rutherford Stuyvesant (hence the name Rutherford Place), who created the square and in 1836 sold it to the city for $5. The namesake of Nathan D. Perlman Place was a 20th-century legislator, judge and philanthropist. The street used to be called Livingston Place, after Margaret Livingston, a Stuyvesant by marriage.Area schools like the Friends Seminary on Rutherford Place are an important part of the equation for parents like Mark Millhone, who chose his new Stuyvesant Park apartment in part because of them.“For a certain kind of downtown parent,” he said, “we couldn’t imagine a better situation.”Connected to the historic Meeting House, Friends was founded in 1786 and teaches kindergarten through Grade 12. It has about 650 students, and tuition is about $26,500 a year.Public School 40 on 19th Street, which offers kindergarten through Grade 5, has an enrollment of about 530. Of fourth graders there in 2005, 83.5 percent read at or above grade level in English, compared with 60.4 percent of fourth graders citywide, and 94.9 percent did so in math, compared with 78.3 percent citywide.For Grades 6 through 8, there is Middle School 104, also known as the Simon Baruch Middle School, on East 21st Street, and the Salk School of Science Middle School, on East 19th, which is affiliated with the New York University School of Medicine.The High School for Health Professions and Human Services on East 15th Street offers Grades 9 through 12 and has about 1,500 enrollees. Average SAT scores in 2004-2005 were 433 on the verbal section, compared with 497 statewide, and 451 on the math, compared with 511 statewide.On Second Avenue between 14th and 15th Streets is the public Manhattan Comprehensive Night and Day High School. It is open from 9 a.m. to 11 p.m. Monday through Thursday, 9 a.m. to 8 p.m. on Friday and 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. on Sunday.Three blocks away, Union Square is a subway hub. The lines include the N, Q, R, W, 4, 5, 6 and L, which parallels 14th Street. Buses run on First, Second and Third Avenues, and crosstown on 14th Street.What We LikeThe conversion of larger, formerly institutional buildings like Rutherford Place and Landmark 17 is helping to recapture the original elegance of this enclave.Maybe some newcomers to the area will bring the additional energy, enthusiasm and funds necessary to burnish the already considerable beauties of Stuyvesant Square Park.'"
