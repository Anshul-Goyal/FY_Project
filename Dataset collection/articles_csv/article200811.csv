"'08-11-01,'0','John the Contender and Sarah the Subverter limped into these last days hoping against hope. All else had failed, even McCain’s complete apostasy. Their flagging ticket had fallen in the polls, and they were preying for an upset for which there was no precedent.According to a report released Monday, there have been only two upsets since 1952: Reagan vs. Carter in 1980 and Bush vs. Gore in 2000. Neither is particularly analogous to the current race.In 1980, the candidates’ one and only debate was a week before Election Day. Reagan won the debate, and that turned the election. This year, McCain was drubbed in all three . In 2000, the lead in the polls flip-flopped constantly. Gore eked out a popular vote win, but didn’t win the Electoral College. This year, McCain hasn’t held the lead in the polls since mid-September. And Obama already has enough states leaning his way to handily win the Electoral College, plus he’s either tied or leading in the toss-up states.So McCain’s final volley was to brand a socialist, assail his associations and rile up the rurals. For that to work, everything else would have to fall in McCain’s favor. To say that it hasn’t is a gross understatement.Oct. 22: gets smacked down for dressing up. (You know it’s hard out here when you primp.)Oct. 23: The candidates personally reach out to a campaign volunteer who claimed that a black man had carved a backward on her face during a mugging to punish her for not supporting Obama. The volunteer later confesses to fabricating the story. Scars all around.'"
"'08-11-01,'0','In “Ceding the Center” (column, Oct. 26), David Brooks says that John McCain has “a good health care plan that was never fully explained.”Mr. McCain has proposed a disastrous plan that most experts agree would destroy the tax-exempt employment-based insurance system and leave employees on their own to shop for whatever private insurance they could afford, supported by a tax credit of only $2,500 for an individual or $5,000 for a family.The average current cost of decent private plans is more than double those amounts and is very likely to increase rapidly over the next four years.Mr. McCain claims that individuals should be able to shop for insurance bargains, which would bring the cost of premiums down. Anyone who understands how the private health insurance industry operates would know that this is not a workable idea. Individuals have little or no consumer bargaining power, and insurers have no incentive to sell insurance to those most likely to need coverage.The McCain plan would very probably increase, not decrease, the ranks of the uninsured and the underinsured.The writer, a medical doctor, is a senior lecturer in social medicine at Harvard Medical School and a former editor of The New England Journal of Medicine.'"
"'08-11-01,'0','Mr. McCain grinned merrily at a rally at United High School in Hanoverton, where he declared, “It’s Halloween, so what do the Democrats do? Every four years they run out and they try to scare seniors by saying that Republicans are going to take away their Social Security or we’re going to take away Medicare.”In the same rally, Mr. McCain said Mr. Obama was presumptively measuring for curtains at the White House and assembling advisers. “And this week he settled on a chief of staff,” Mr. McCain added, referring to news reports that Representative Rahm Emanuel, Democrat of Illinois, might have that job in an Obama White House.And at a rally on the edge of the Ohio River in Steubenville, Mr. McCain called out to people with handheld signs that identified them, he said, as “Eric the Lawyer” and “Doug the Undertaker.” Both were offspring of “Joe the Plumber,” a.k.a. Samuel J. Wurzelbacher, who has come to embody the small-business everyman at the center of Mr. McCain’s late-October campaign asserting Mr. Obama is a tax-and-spend redistributor of wealth.Mr. McCain’s campaign manager, Rick Davis, sounded an upbeat theme when he asserted in a lengthy conference call with reporters on Friday morning that the campaign’s polls showed that another state, Iowa, was “dead even” — public polls show Mr. Obama ahead by double digits — and that the race was tightening.“We’re pretty jazzed up about what we’re seeing as movement in this election,” Mr. Davis said, adding that “we are witnessing, I believe, probably one of the greatest comebacks that you’ve seen since John McCain won the primary.”As Mr. Davis spun it out, the McCain campaign plans to outspend Mr. Obama on television by $10 million in the final days of the race.“The fact that we have enough resources to punch our message through in the final days of this campaign indicates to us a great potential to be able to compete in the air against Obama in a way we have not been able to do since this campaign,” Mr. Davis said.Despite the campaign’s public cheer, Republicans across the board said Mr. McCain faced a highly difficult task. “I know it is going to be a very tough uphill battle for him,” Mr. Schwarzenegger told reporters in California before leaving for Ohio.And Representative Tom Davis, the Virginia Republican who led House Republican re-election efforts from 1998 through 2002, in a television interview on Friday shied from calling Mr. McCain the victor.“I’m not going to predict a McCain victory because I’ve got my reputation on the line,” Mr. Davis told Al Hunt on Bloomberg Television.This weekend, Mr. McCain is to appear on “Saturday Night Live,” indicating that as the Republican nominee he is willing to accept the inherent risks in a comedy spot only three days before the election, and on a show that has regularly mocked the Republican ticket.The campaign did not say what Mr. McCain would do on the show, but he is almost certain to make only a brief appearance in the middle of what will be a marathon final push to Nov. 4. Mr. McCain, who on Friday was on a daylong bus tour in Ohio, will be in Virginia, Pennsylvania and New York on Saturday, in New Hampshire on Sunday, and on a seven-state swing, ending very late in Arizona, on Monday.'"
"'08-11-01,'0','Dwyane Wade had 20 points and 8 assists, Michael Beasley finished with 17 points and the Miami Heat scored a whopping 41 points off turnovers in its home opener to easily beat the Sacramento Kings, 103-77, on Friday night.It was the biggest victory margin for Miami (1-1) since it beat Chicago by 33 points on March 7, 2007, and it matched the largest in a Miami home opener.“We played like a team,” Beasley said. “We were relentless on defense. We had so much intensity, we played with energy, we played together the whole game. That’s what felt the best.”A 39-13 run over the middle two quarters turned it into a rout. Sacramento, which had five turnovers on its first six possessions, did not hit the 60-point mark until 6 minutes 35 seconds remained.CELTICS 96, BULLS 80 Kevin Garnett, who became the youngest player to play 1,000 games, scored 18 points for host Boston. The Celtics led by at least 10 points throughout the final three quarters. The Bulls made only 10 of 45 shots (22.2 percent) in the first half and went 25 for 84 (29.8 percent) for the game. Garnett reached the 1,000-game mark at the age of 32 years 165 days. He broke the record of 33 years 24 days set by Shawn Kemp in 2002.GRIZZLIES 86, MAGIC 84 Rudy Gay made an 18-foot jumper as time expired for host Memphis.

"'08-11-01,'0','The Qaeda member said to have been killed Friday was identified as Abu Kasha, the intelligence officials said. He had been living in Pakistan’s tribal region for about three years and had been organizing attacks on foreign troops in Afghanistan, the officials said.They spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk to the news media.The purported Qaeda figure was among 20 people killed when two missiles hit a house and a car in the village of Mir Ali in North Waziristan, the intelligence officials said, citing reports from agents and informers in the area.About two hours later, two more missiles hit a village in South Waziristan, killing seven people, including a number of foreign militants, the officials said.Pakistan’s government has insisted that the missile strikes — along with a highly unusual ground raid by United States commandos in September — violated its sovereignty. It insists the Pakistani military is confronting the militants, pointing to the current offensive just north of Waziristan that has killed 1,500 insurgents.Pakistan’s alliance with the United States is deeply unpopular among lawmakers and many other civilians, who say it fuels violence by the extremists and who complain that the raids prompt retaliatory terrorist attacks within Pakistan by militant groups entrenched in the tribal areas.In a sign of the extremists’ resilience, a suicide bomber attacked a police chief outside his house on Friday in the northwestern city of Mardan, missing the official but killing three other officers and five civilians, the authorities said.The suicide bomber set off the explosion as the first vehicle in a convoy emerged from the police chief’s residence, but the officer was in a different car behind the gate.“I was the target, but such attacks cannot stop us from doing our duty,” said the police chief, Akhtar Ali Shah.Television images showed a badly damaged police pickup truck just outside the house and rescue workers loading bloodied survivors into ambulances.There have been more than 90 suicide attacks on civilian, military and Western targets since July 2007, killing nearly 1,200 people, according to military statistics.'"
"'08-11-01,'0','LOS ANGELES — On Tuesday, California voters will consider three ballot measures that propose wide-ranging changes to the state’s criminal justice system but also pit law enforcement officials against civil rights advocates.One initiative, Proposition 5, would increase financing for drug rehabilitation programs and reduce penalties for some drug- and addiction-related crimes. Another, Proposition 6, would increase financing for law enforcement and increase penalties for drug- and gang-related offenses. And a third, Proposition 9, would expand victims’ roles in criminal and parole proceedings, prioritize restitution payments to victims and reduce the frequency of parole hearings for offenders.By financing alternatives for drug treatment, Proposition 5 would supplement a 2000 measure, Proposition 36, which mandated drug courts and rehabilitation for most people convicted of drug possession. The initiative would expand the kinds of offenders eligible for drug treatment to include those who committed non-drug-related crimes because of addiction. For example, someone convicted of burglary could claim he was trying to feed his drug habit and so would be eligible for treatment instead of jail.Proposition 5 would dismiss certain felony drug violations and seal the records of some drug offenders after probation. The initiative would also shorten parole for most drug offenses, reduce penalties for marijuana possession and limit judges’ discretion to imprison certain parole and probation violators.Ethan Nadelmann, executive director of the Drug Policy Alliance Network, a nonprofit organization that works to ease drug penalties and has contributed $400,000 to push Proposition 5, said the measure would help reduce overcrowding in California prisons, which are facing a federal takeover.'"
"'08-11-01,'0','“His goal was that every district would have a 100 percent graduation rate, and I think, by and large, you see improvements across the board,” said Henry L. Grishman, superintendent of the Jericho district on Long Island and former president of the New York State Council of School Superintendents. Jericho’s graduation rate has averaged between 98 percent and 100 percent in each of the last three years, up from about 85 percent in the mid-1990s.With the Regents’ backing, Mr. Mills in 1999 began holding districts accountable for student performance on state achievement tests, a practice that later became mandatory under the 2001 federal law called No Child Left Behind. The state also established a system of state report cards to help parents and community members evaluate their local schools.In particular, Mr. Mills and state education officials made it a priority to close the achievement gap for poor and minority students by advocating for more financial resources for districts with large numbers of poor and disadvantaged students, and by eventually developing a new school aid formula that allocated more money for high-needs districts, including New York City’s.“What we’ve learned is that the direction set by a state leader matters a lot in terms of whether kids learn or don’t,” said Kati Haycock, president of the Education Trust, an advocacy group based in Washington. “If you judge this man by the improvement in achievement, especially among minority and poor students, you would have to say that he helped bring about some of the biggest gains in the country.”But some educators and parents have said that Mr. Mills placed too much emphasis on standardized testing — with the result that many schools focused on drilling students on basic skills in English and math that were covered on tests at the expense of more creative forms of instruction in poetry and writing as well as in enrichment activities like art, music and even field trips.Mr. Mills has also been criticized for his oversight of the 2,800-student Roosevelt school district on Long Island, which struggled with financial problems and weak student performance for years after it was taken over by the Education Department in 2002. In January, the State Legislature approved an $8 million bailout for the district to settle an accumulated debt that had threatened to cripple its daily operations.Mr. Mills said he wished that he had known about Roosevelt’s recent financial problems sooner, but moved quickly to address them once he did. He pointed out that the state had built new buildings in the district and sent in some of the state’s top administrators to oversee improvements.He said that while standardized testing was necessary as a way to gauge student achievement fairly and consistently, he had also emphasized the need for art and music and other creative pursuits.Mr. Mills got his start in education as a history teacher at the Dalton School on the Upper East Side of Manhattan from 1967 to 1971, after earning bachelor’s and master’s degrees in history from Middlebury College and Columbia University. He subsequently helped establish and run the Elizabeth Seeger School, an alternative public high school, on West 12th Street.Mr. Mills said that he planned to continue working in the education field and would be considering his options after stepping down as commissioner.“It will be hard to leave in June, but there’s time to get a lot of work done between now and then,” he said. “This experience has been exhilarating — even the hardest day has had a clear purpose. I’ve never tired of it.”'"

A panel of doctors and researchers said the F.D.A. had failed to provide enough evidence that the chemical, bisphenol-A, or BPA, was not a risk to the public. The panel said more research was needed. BPA, used to stiffen plastic and line metal cans, has been linked in some research to diabetes and developmental changes in children.The F.D.A. issued a draft finding in August saying the chemical was safe as currently used. The F.D.A. commissioner, Andrew C. von Eschenbach, told reporters on Friday that the August report was the first step in a scientific process and that the final version might incorporate the panel’s suggestions.'"
"'08-11-01,'0','That would make the bear market almost, but not quite, as bad as the 1973-74 bear market, which ended with the index down 48 percent.In the 2000-2 bear market, the fall was 49 percent.The hectic market action in October spread across most of the globe. Remarkably, the American market was one of the calmer markets during the month. Several had more volatility and larger swings in prices.Nor was the volatility limited to stock prices. Oil prices fell 33 percent during October, making this the worst month for that market since oil futures began trading in 1983. Oil is down to just under $68 a barrel, from a peak over $145 in July.One volatility measure, shown in the accompanying charts, is the number of days in which an index closes up or down at least 4 percent.In normal times, the market goes years without having even one such day. There were none, for instance, from 2003 through 2007. There were three such days throughout the 1950s and two in the 1960s.In October, there were nine such days.The accompanying chart shows the months, from 1928 through the present, when the S.& P. 500 had at least five days with 4 percent moves. Most of them were during the 1929 crash and the Great Depression.Until now, September 1932 held the record for the most days with big moves, at eight.Two days during October ended with the index leaping more than 9 percent, something that had happened only nine times in the previous 80 years.For the week, the S.& P. 500 was up 10.5 percent, the best weekly gain since a 14.1 percent rise in the week that ended Oct. 11, 1974.If the rebound this week indicated that the bear market of 2007-8 had ended, it lasted just over a year and hit bottom on Monday, at 848.92. It recovered to 968.75 by week’s end.There were similar moves in most major indexes. The Dow Jones industrial average ended the week up 11.3 percent, at 9,325.01, and the Nasdaq composite climbed 10.9 percent, to 1,720.95.For the month, the S.& P. 500 was still down 16.9 percent, the worst showing for the index since it fell 21.8 percent in October 1987. The Dow fell 14.1 percent, and the Nasdaq index lost 17.7 percent.Both moves — weekly and monthly — affected every sector and nearly every stock. Only seven of the stocks in the S.& P. 100 fell this week, while just nine were up for the month.Of the 30 stocks in the Dow industrials, only one fell this week. General Motors dropped 16 cents to $5.79 amid talks on a possible merger with Chrysler and additional government aid.For the month, all 30 were down, with Alcoa turning in the worst performance with a decline of 49 percent. But in the final week, it rose 22 percent, ending at $11.50 after trading as low as $9 and as high as $22.35 during the month. It traded at more than $47 last year.During the bear market, financial stocks led the way down. The S.& P. financial index fell 65 percent from the high it reached in early 2007 to the low close on Monday. By Friday, the index had recovered 17 percent.Internationally, Russia led the volatility parade, with an astonishing 17 days with 4 percent moves in the Micex index. It might have had more if Russia had not closed the market on Oct. 10, fearful of the selling panic that was sweeping the world.That index ended the week up 42.5 percent. For the month, it was still down 28.8 percent,Many countries, among them Britain, Japan, India and Brazil, also showed more volatility than the United States.That volatility was so high everywhere was an indication of how linked markets have become in the age of globalization. It is not just that most industrial countries appear to be in recession, or close to it. Another factor is that investors now own portfolios of shares from around the globe, and in times of stress may sell what they can, instead of just what they want to unload.The period from 2003 through 2007 — when there were no daily moves of at least 4 percent in the United States — became known as the “Great Moderation” to some economists. That very lack of volatility encouraged investors to take more risks by borrowing money, and encouraged others to lend it.All of the big days in September and October came after Lehman Brothers was allowed to fail. That Lehman was not deemed important enough to save signaled to investors that there was risk where they thought there was none and caused a sharp tightening of credit for many borrowers, despite efforts by central banks to push interest rates down.The big advances, on Oct. 13 and again on Tuesday, came as hope grew that the financial system would be protected. The first came on the Monday after the Group of 7 finance ministers promised to take steps to protect banks. This week’s big move came amid indications that central banks would aggressively cut interest rates.Such wild volatility may be an indication that a bottom was reached. The biggest week since World War II did come at the end of the 1973-74 bear market, and the biggest week in the 1980s, a gain of 8.8 percent, came just after prices hit bottom on Aug. 12, 1982.Or the wild moves could just show how baffled investors are by a series of events unlike any they can remember.'"
"'08-11-01,'0','Hexion Specialty Chemicals suffered a serious legal blow on Friday when a New York State court judge refused to extend the lending commitments from the company’s banks for its proposed merger with Huntsman.The decision throws the fate of the $6.5 billion deal into doubt, and could leave Hexion and its parent, the private equity firm Apollo Management, on the hook for billions of dollars in legal damages.The financing commitments of the banks, Credit Suisse and Deutsche Bank, are scheduled to expire on Saturday.In her court ruling on Friday, Justice Eileen C. Bransten of the State Supreme Court ruled that the banks were entitled to their original contract.Friday’s decision is the latest blow to Hexion, which was found by a Delaware court judge to have intentionally breached its agreement with Huntsman.In its Delaware lawsuit, the company argued that forcing the deal’s completion would leave the combined Hexion-Huntsman insolvent. But the Delaware judge ordered Hexion to make its “reasonable best efforts” to obtain the necessary financing to close the transaction.'"
"'08-11-01,'0','The new worry is that in the worst case, the end of inflation may be the beginning of something malevolent: a long, slow retrenchment in which consumers and businesses worldwide lose the wherewithal to buy, sending prices down for many goods. Though still considered unlikely, that would prompt businesses to slow production and accelerate layoffs, taking more paychecks out of the economy and further weakening demand.The danger of this is the difficulty of a cure. Policy makers can generally choke off inflation by raising interest rates, dampening economic activity and reducing demand for goods. But as Japan discovered, an economy may remain ensnared by deflation for many years, even when interest rates are dropped to zero: falling prices make companies reluctant to invest even when credit is free.Through much of the 1990s, prices for property and many goods kept falling in Japan. As layoffs increased and purchasing power declined, prices fell lower still, in a downward spiral of diminishing fortunes. Some fear the American economy could be sinking toward a similar fate, if a recession is deep and prolonged, as consumers lose spending power just as much of Europe, Asia and Latin America succumb to a slowdown.“That’s a meaningful risk at this point,” said Nouriel Roubini, an economist at New York University’s Stern School of Business, who forecast the financial crisis well in advance and has been warning of deflation for months. “We could get into a vicious circle of deepening malaise.”Most economists — Mr. Roubini and Mr. Barbera included — say American policy makers have tools to avert the sort of deflationary black hole that captured Japan. Deflation fears last broke out in the United States in 2003, but the Federal Reserve defeated the menace with low interest rates that kept the economy growing. This time, the Fed is again being aggressive, dropping its target rate to 1 percent this week. And the government’s various bailout plans have also pumped money into the economy.“If you print enough money, you can create inflation,” said Kenneth S. Rogoff, a former chief economist at the International Monetary Fund and now a professor at Harvard.But even as American authorities unleash credit, the threat has intensified. Not since the Depression have so many countries faced so much trouble at once. The financial crisis has gone global, like a virus mutating in the face of every experimental cure. From South Korea to Iceland to Brazil, the pandemic has spread, bringing with it a tightening of credit that has starved even healthy companies of finance.“We’re entering a really fierce global recession,” Mr. Rogoff said. “A significant financial crisis has been allowed to morph into a full-fledged global panic. It’s a very dangerous situation. The danger is that instead of having a few bad years, we’ll have another lost decade.”Global economic growth has flourished in recent years, much of it fertilized with borrowed investment. This raised kingdoms of houses in Florida and California, steel mills in Ukraine, slaughterhouses in Brazil and shopping malls in Turkey.That tide is now moving in reverse. Banks and other financial institutions are reckoning with hundreds of billions of dollars worth of disastrous investments. As they struggle to rebuild their capital, they are halting loans to many customers, demanding swift repayment from others and dumping assets — homes sold out of foreclosure, investments linked to mortgages and corporate loans. Selling is pushing prices down further, making the assets left on balance sheets worth less, in some cases prompting another round of sales.“You get this adverse feedback loop where assets keep falling in value,” Mr. Barbera said. “You’re essentially putting big downward pressure on the global economy.”In past crises, like those that devastated Mexico in 1994 and much of Asia in 1997 and 1998, weak economies managed to recover by exporting aggressively, not least to the United States. But American consumers are battered this time. After years of borrowing against homes and tapping credit cards, consumers are pulling back.From Asia to Latin America, exports are slowing and should continue to do so as the global appetite shrinks. This is spawning fears that major producers like China and India — which vastly expanded production capacity in recent years — will have to dump products on world markets to keep factories running and stave off unemployment, pressing prices lower.Earlier this year, some analysts suggested that American businesses might continue to prosper, even as consumers pulled back at home, by selling into foreign markets. Caterpillar, the construction equipment manufacturer, might suffer declining sales in the United States, the argument went, but huge projects from Russia to Dubai required front-end loaders. Australia and Brazil needed earth-movers to expand mining operations as they sent iron ore toward smelters in Northeast Asia.But as much of the planet now struggles, Caterpillar is worried. “Next year, no doubt, will be a challenge,” Caterpillar’s chief executive, James W. Owens, recently warned.China has long been at the center of claims that the world could keep growing regardless of American troubles. China has been importing cotton from India and the United States; electronics components from South Korea, Malaysia and Taiwan; timber from Russia and Africa; and oil from the Middle East.But many of the finished goods China produces with these materials have ultimately landed in the United States, Europe and Japan. When consumers pull back in those countries, Chinese factories feel the impact, along with their suppliers around the globe.Fewer laptop computers shipped from China spells less demand for chips. Last week, Toshiba — Japan’s largest chip maker — said it lost $275 million from July to September, blaming its troubles on a world glut.Lower demand for flat-screen televisions means less need for flat-panel glass displays. This month, Samsung, the Korean electronics giant, said a global oversupply in that item caused its biggest dip in quarterly profits in three years.Now, a glut of products may be building in the United States. Orders for trucks used by business have plummeted. Investments in industrial equipment are declining. Yet inventories have grown.“I worry about an economy that looks like Japan,” said Barry P. Bosworth, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. “We’re going to be struggling with how to put this back together again for several more years.”'"
"'08-11-01,'0','But that would be too bad, because theirs is a story of guts and grit, of five women who leaned on one another to rein in individual money habits that were fairly destructive.Their example ought to be enough to inspire others to form or join money clubs, though this isn’t the first time that people have suggested it. An organization called the Women’s Institute for Financial Education already holds a trademark on the term “money club” and has helped people form them in the past.So why hasn’t the movement taken hold? Many people are afraid of admitting their financial cluelessness to others, or they’re ashamed of their bad decisions. Plenty of others are simply uncomfortable talking about the topic. Money is the last taboo, even when sex or your shrink is fair game for polite conversation.But now should be the time when we all get over our hang-ups and join the emerging national conversation about our borrowing and spending habits.The five women in Vancouver started their own conversation in March 2006. Andrea Baxter, who worked in marketing, had run up $18,000 in debt beyond her mortgage. (One of her creditors eventually turned her account over to a collection agency.)Ms. Baxter happened to see an episode of “The Show” about going on a debt and she recruited others to slim down with her. Four others eventually signed on, including two colleagues from work. “It was scary to go and tell them what my financial situation was at the time,” she said. “I thought they would think less of me.”Indeed, a younger colleague who joined the group, Sandra Hanna, was taken aback. “I’d been blown away at how put together these girls were, with their designer sunglasses and the right purse,” said Ms. Hanna, who was relatively new at the company at the time. “That was the biggest eye opener for me at the first money club meeting. Andrea presented this image of perfection, but she was a disaster.”Ms. Hanna had actually saved $8,000 by living at home after graduating from college, but she blew through all of it once she moved out and had run up $2,000 in credit card debt. “I was on track to be in Andrea’s position,” she said. Besides scaring Ms. Hanna into living within her means, the money group paid other dividends fairly quickly for her. She was the most junior of the three women from her company in the group, and knowing how much money the other two made gave her leverage when it came time to talk with her boss about a promotion. Once they shared the information with Ms. Hanna, however, they expected her to use it to stand up for herself.“It makes my heart pound just to think about it now, but I knew I had to come back and tell the girls in the money group how that conversation went,” she said. “Having that support, even sending me e-mails that morning, and then having someone to congratulate you when you’ve actually accomplished something is something you really look forward to.”There’s something wonderfully subversive about this approach to salary negotiation, though it could have led to resentment had Ms. Hanna’s boss not given her what she wanted. So if this seems dangerous, there is certainly no rule saying you need to form your money club with co-workers.Here are a few other issues to consider before starting a club:MEMBERS Even if you decide to keep colleagues out, it’s best to have people in your group who share the same sets of concerns. Usually this will mean being in the same stage of life, like retirement or new parenthood, and in the same general band of household income.COMMITMENT As with anything difficult, from exercise to psychotherapy, it’s hard to accomplish much if you don’t do it regularly. The Smart Cookies met weekly for the first two years. “We needed a lot of help,” Ms. Baxter said. “I had the most debt and needed someone to keep me on track.”DISCLOSURE The point of the process is to rid yourself of all destructive habits, so hiding things is self-defeating. “You come to the meeting and you come clean,” said Angela Self, another member.CONFIDENTIALITY The first rule of money club is that you do not talk about money club. What’s said in the meeting stays in the meeting. But the hardest part of starting a club, especially if participants know nonmembers in common, is having faith that no one will gossip to outsiders about the others.“It was super-intimidating at first,” said Robyn Gunn, another Smart Cookies member. As a social worker, she knew the group could accomplish much more through open communication than if everyone tried to sort out their problems on their own. But the first step still wasn’t easy. “At the first meeting, we had a bit of wine, and once you start with something so disarming, like sharing bank statements, you build trust pretty quickly.”AGENDA It’s best to have an agenda, so the meetings stay focused. The women in Vancouver follow the same general format each session: Good news from every member, a spending check-in, individual debt reports, brainstorming about how to make more money, a discussion topic that someone has researched, and goal setting.None of this has to be boring. During the Smart Cookies meeting I listened in on, the spending portion of the program was especially rollicking. It was a study in working the angles, touching on bartering professional services for personal training sessions, consignment shops, tamping down lust (but giving in to the call of Costco) and the fine art of mooching wine off your parents.If all this sounds like oversharing, there are certainly other ways to get in shape financially. Plenty of people use financial planners as financial baby sitters — enforcers who keep them in line. This can be a fine thing, though you’ll pay by the hour or turn over 1 percent of your assets or so each year in exchange for the discipline.For people who prefer to go it alone, you can simply fine yourself for not meeting savings goals or reallocating your assets regularly. A site called stickk.com lets you state your intent, identify a referee who can verify whether you hit your mark and pay penalties if you don’t succeed. The fine can go to an anticharity if you wish, say the Clinton Presidential Library for those who find the man distasteful, or the athletic fund of your alma mater’s archrival.I registered this week and put up $500. The goal? Goad myself into doing something I have long thought about but never managed to do: form a money club of my own by the end of the year.In last week’s column, I compared the 10-year performance of $100,000 in a typical index annuity with the return of a Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index fund. The final balance of $81,890 did not include reinvested dividends. According to Vanguard, if you had reinvested the dividends in its fund, you would have ended up with $95,870, still nowhere near the $176,478 that the annuity would have delivered.'"
"'08-11-01,'0','It is possible for a traveler to go farther in one direction on earth — but not much. When all their expenses are counted, their trip will have cost them about $5,000, Ms. Scott-Ker said.Experts say Americans are showing more interest and passion about this election than they have in nearly 50 years. But it is still likely that one-third of the eligible voters will not take part — much less spend two full days traveling around the world to do so.For Ms. Scott-Ker, 45, a native of New Zealand, and her husband, who was born in Morocco, the votes they intend to cast on Tuesday in the Washington Heights section of Manhattan will be their first, ever. They became American citizens on Nov. 30, 2007.“We became citizens so we could vote,” Ms. Scott-Ker said. “We’d lived here 13 years on green cards, paid lots of tax money, but you have no voice within the system.”A few months after they were sworn in as citizens, Ms. Scott-Ker was transferred to Bangalore by her employer, Accenture, a management consulting, technology and outsourcing company, as its marketing director for India. She kept her eye on the election, filing the voter registration forms in August and getting the confirmation in early October. Then she discovered that an absentee ballot would require a separate application to the city Board of Elections.“In this highly technological age and city, do we need to be mailing applications halfway around the world, just so you can get a piece of mail sent back to the same place?” Ms. Scott-Ker wondered aloud.In a word, yes. So, she said, she followed the requirements “to the letter. I even provided an addressed envelope for the ballot to be sent back to us so it would be absolutely perfect, as it would have to have been for the India postal service.”Still, no ballots came. The Board of Elections in Manhattan — its funding cut this year in a dispute with the mayor — has been laggard in sending out absentee ballots, officials say. Ms. Scott-Ker and her husband, a university instructor, knew nothing of that squabble.“We realized we’re not going to get to vote, and we were all geared up to do this,” she said. “We thought, maybe a friend could get the ballots for us in Manhattan and have them couriered to India, and we could courier them back. There were so many ifs and buts. I didn’t want a bureaucratic process to get in the way of casting a ballot.”Her determination is clear. Even so, was it really necessary to go to all that trouble to cast votes in New York State, where most polls give the Democratic ticket a lead of 30 percent or more?“Then you’re relying on other people to do your job,” she said. “Apathy doesn’t work in a democracy.”Soon after she got home, she heard on the news that people in some states said an incorrect vote was registered when they used a touch screen in early voting. She fretted that they might lose their votes in one final foul-up.Not to worry, she was told, the voting machines in New York have been around since at least the early 1960s, and are in no immediate danger of being transformed into digital touch screens.“I was looking online,” she said, “and as far as I could see, there’s no information about the actual mechanics of voting.”She thought for a minute. She and her husband were determined to vote for Barack Obama and Joe Biden. “Is there a test we can take beforehand?” she asked. “We don’t want to squander our vote.”My column last Saturday discussed the troubles encountered by New Yorkers who tried to register to vote using a form supplied by Rock the Vote, which was printed with the address of the State Board of Elections in Albany. That agency does not register voters; under the State Constitution, only the county boards of elections can register voters.After the column appeared, Heather Smith, the executive director of Rock the Vote, contacted me to say that the state address was on a list provided by the federal Election Assistance Commission, and that her group had twice received written confirmation from state officials that they could receive the applications in Albany.In a mass e-mail message sent on Friday afternoon, Ms. Smith said she was optimistic “that everyone who filled out, downloaded, signed and mailed a form by the Oct. 10 registration deadline will be eligible to vote — no matter where you sent it.” She urged people who registered but can’t find their names on the online list at https://voterlookup.elections.state.ny.us/ to contact 1-866-OUR-VOTE (1-866-687-8683).'"
"'08-11-01,'0','The first film’s budget of about $130 million is not exceptionally large by contemporary standards. But Mr. Spielberg and Mr. Jackson, as two of the industry’s most prestigious directors, were demanding nearly a third of the movie’s gross receipts — terms that proved difficult at a time when studios were tightening belts.Paramount later offered to make the movie on terms it found more favorable, but the directors’ representatives pressed for alternatives. Sony offered to take the movie under a deal more to the filmmakers’ liking, but Paramount was reluctant to let go entirely and began discussing a partnership, according to one of the people briefed on the discussions.Under the deal now being discussed, Paramount would distribute the “Tintin” movies in North America and some English-speaking territories, while Sony would distribute the pictures in various foreign territories, including Europe and Latin America, according to a person briefed on the talks. In recent years, studios have routinely split some of their more expensive movies, usually by leaving one studio with foreign distribution rights, and another with domestic.Thus, “The Curious Case of Benjamin Button,” a coming film directed by David Fincher and starring Brad Pitt, will be distributed by Paramount in the United States and by Warner Brothers abroad.For Sony, a deal would be the first time Mr. Spielberg has worked with the studio as a director since 1991, when he made “Hook” for the company’s TriStar Pictures unit. In 1977, Mr. Spielberg made “Close Encounters of the Third Kind,” one of his biggest hits, for Columbia, long before the studio was acquired by Sony.The first “Tintin” movie is expected to be ready for release in 2010. Mr. Jackson’s installment would come some time after, but does not yet have a completed script.For Paramount, a deal would be one more step in the readjustment of its relations with Mr. Spielberg and his new DreamWorks company. The studio had acquired DreamWorks in 2006, but Mr. Spielberg and his associates left to form a new venture under the same name last month.Mr. Spielberg is expected to remain involved with a number of Paramount projects in coming months. He has a producing role, for instance, on “Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen,” a sequel set for release in June.Meanwhile, his new company remains entangled with Paramount through their mutual interest in dozens of development projects that are owned by the big studio, but may be produced and distributed through collaborative arrangements between them over the coming years.'"
"'08-11-01,'0','On a list by the of products that may be tainted with melamine, White Rabbit Candies were the only item that might be handed out on Halloween. Earlier this month, the Canadian Food Inspection Agency recalled 30-ounce containers of Sherwood Brands Pirate’s Gold Milk Chocolate Coins.A spokeswoman for the F.D.A. said that the agency was constantly adjusting a nationwide sampling of products being tested for melamine as new potential threats were brought to its attention. The F.D.A. and state and local authorities have been sampling products in Asian food markets across the United States since mid-September for traces of melamine.“Thus far, most of F.D.A.’s testing of milk and milk-derived ingredients and products from China focused on human foods, but have included animal feeds as well,” said the spokeswoman, Stephanie Kwisnek. “The F.D.A. is currently re-evaluating its overall approach to keeping these products out of the U.S. market.”Asian food safety experts warned consumers not to grow too alarmed over the finding of tainted eggs because they contained much lower concentrations of melamine than the powdered baby formula that caused such widespread problems in China.Hong Kong food safety officials said a child would have to eat about two dozen of the eggs in a single day to become ill.Still, if eggs, milk and animal feed are tainted, there is the specter of an even wider array of foods that could come under scrutiny, including pork, chicken, bread, cakes, seafood and candy.China is also one of the world’s largest exporters of food and food ingredients, including meats, seafood, beverages and .Melamine was banned as an animal feed additive in China in July 2007. And last year, United States regulators put tough restrictions on the amount of melamine allowed in food products.But interviews on Friday and over the past year with several Chinese chemical dealers who sell melamine suggested that melamine scrap, the substantially cheaper waste left over after producing melamine, continued to be added to animal and fish feed.“I heard some melamine dealers still sell to animal feed producers,” said Qin Huaizhen, manager at the Gaocheng Kaishun Chemical Company in the city of Shijiazhuang, though he insisted that he had never done so. “In Shandong Province, many animal feed manufacturers buy melamine scrap.”Two other melamine dealers in eastern and southern China said that only after the recent dairy scandal did government regulators begin to closely monitor the sale of melamine to animal feed producers.Kidney experts said there had been very little research into how melamine disrupts kidney function. Dr. Fredric L. Coe, a professor of medicine at the , said that melamine is likely to be concentrated in the kidneys in the form of crystals that the body cannot dissolve. Those crystals clog many of the kidney’s nearly one million nephrons, which are tiny filtering units, Dr. Coe said. Urination slows or ceases, and patients suffer acute kidney failure, he said.Some food safety experts are perplexed as to how melamine was allowed to seep into China’s food supplies after melamine-tainted pet-food exports from China were blamed last year for sickening dogs and cats in the United States, touching off international trade and food safety disputes between the countries.“A year ago, everybody should have been in a complete panic about it and done something then,” said Marion Nestle, a professor of food studies and public health at and the author of “Pet Food Politics: The Chihuahua in the Coal Mine. Someone should have required that melamine not be in any food product.”The pet food case led to a vast recall in the United States and in other parts of the world, and it also incited a lengthy food safety crackdown in China, with regulators boasting that they had closed down thousands of illegal or substandard food factories and slaughterhouses.Still, the Chinese government never made clear last year or even this year how extensively it had tested its own food and feed supply for melamine, even though melamine dealers acknowledged that it was common to sell melamine scrap to food and feed producers.In the case of the tainted dairy, Chinese investigators have arrested dozens of suspects and have accused a group of rogue milk and melamine dealers of intentionally adding melamine to milk supplies as cheap filler in order to save money.High-ranking government officials, including the head of the nation’s quality watchdog, have been fired in the wake of the recalls, and has acknowledged that “lax regulation” contributed to the scandal.Similarly, last year, regulators in Beijing largely blamed a pair of small exporters for the pet food debacle. Regulators said the exporters had shipped feed or feed ingredients contaminated with melamine in order to save money and to cheat the buyers.Beijing also insisted its food safety problems were exaggerated, perhaps partly as a protectionist ploy to slow the boom in Chinese imports.But several farmers and melamine scrap dealers said in interviews last year that melamine had been used for years in animal feed, particularly fish feed. Many melamine producers said they believed that melamine scrap was nontoxic and would not be harmful to animals or humans.Melamine dealers say the government crackdown on the sale to feed producers occurred only this year, after Sanlu Group announced that its powdered infant milk formula was tainted with melamine. That announcement, which came in September, set off a nationwide recall and government announcements that other major dairy brands were also selling melamine-contaminated milk.“Before the Sanlu scandal, we were not banned from selling melamine to anyone” Niu Qinglin, manager of the Hebei Jinglong Fengli Chemical Company, said in a telephone interview on Friday. “I had heard melamine dealers sell melamine to animal feed companies and food companies. It was common before the Sanlu scandal.”Mr. Niu said, however, that he never sold melamine or melamine scrap to food or feed producers. And he noted that regulators had moved in on the trade. “Now,” he said, “the government regulates that melamine cannot be sold to any animal feed manufacturers or food processing companies.”'"
"'08-11-01,'0','HOUSTON — The Chevron Corporation, the oil company, said Friday that its third-quarter profit more than doubled on the back of record crude prices this summer.Chevron capped off a string of robust quarterly profit reports from oil companies, including another American corporate profit record for the Exxon Mobil Corporation.Altogether, Chevron, Exxon Mobil and their rivals BP, Royal Dutch Shell and ConocoPhillips posted earnings of $44.4 billion for the quarter, up 58 percent from the same time a year ago.But this period of astounding, sometimes record profits may be coming to an end.Crude prices peaked at about $145 near the start of the quarter in mid-July before embarking on a steep slide that has continued into the fourth quarter. When the third quarter ended Sept. 30, benchmark crude prices were still around $100 a barrel. In early trading Friday, they slipped below $64 a barrel.Chevron, based in San Ramon, Calif., said it earned $7.89 billion, or $3.85 a share, in the three months ended Sept. 30, compared with $3.72 billion, or $1.75 a share, at the period a year ago.'"
"'08-11-01,'0','Investors also shook off a report from the Commerce Department that showed inflation running at 4.2 percent in September compared with a year ago, down slightly from the 4.5 percent annual gain in August.At the close, the S.& P. was at 968.75, up 1.54 percent, or 14.66 points. The Nasdaq composite index rose 1.3 percent, or 22.43 points, to 1,720.95.The Commerce Department report showed salaries running far behind the rising cost of living — effectively a pay cut. Income rose 0.2 percent in September compared with August, and consumer spending declined 0.3 percent. The savings rate jumped to 1.3 percent, from 0.8 percent in August.Those numbers did not bode well for consumer spending, which in recent years made up more than two-thirds of American economic growth. And anxieties have led many Americans to spend less.“Conditions for consumer spending in the fourth quarter are not expected to improve, with further downward pressure on employment, consumer confidence and net household worth,” Brian Bethune, an economist at IHS Global Insight, wrote in a note. “As a result, we expect another sharp quarterly decline in real consumer spending.”The Commerce Department reported on Thursday that American consumer spending fell last quarter by the most in three decades. With layoffs on the rise and a retrenchment in consumer credit, economists expect Americans to cut back on their spending habits well into next year.Outside of food and fuel products, prices climbed 2.4 percent, above the Federal Reserve’s preferred ceiling of 2 percent.Those figures, based on the personal consumption expenditures price index, were about in line with expectations, and reflected the falling cost of energy stemming from a 30 percent slide in oil prices.European shares closed higher. The FTSE-100 index in London gained 2 percent; the CAC-40 index in Paris was up 2.3 percent; and the DAX in Frankfurt rose 2.4 percent.In London, Barclays bank said it planned to raise £7.3 billion ($11.8 billion) by selling shares to Abu Dhabi and Qatar to meet new capital requirements for banks. Shares of Barclays fell 12.8 percent.The BT Group, a telecommunications company based in Britain, declined 20 percent after a profit warning.Shares in the consumer cosmetics giant L’Oréal, based in France, dropped 2.9 percent after the company ratcheted back its sales outlook through the end of the year. The warning underscored concerns among consumer-oriented businesses, which are bracing for one of the worst holiday shopping seasons in years.The Bank of Japan cut its benchmark interest rate for the first time in more than seven years, a move intended to stimulate the slumping Japanese economy. The recent surge in the yen has caused problems for Japanese exporters dependent on foreign demand. The Nikkei, Japan’s major stock index, is trading at a 26-year low.Stocks in Japan fell again, by 5 percent, after the decision, because investors apparently were seeking an even sharper cut.Other Asian markets had a more positive session on the coattails of steps by global central banks to put more liquidity into the financial system. The Korean stock index gained 2.6 percent and Taiwan’s index gained 4 percent. The Hang Seng in Hong Kong lost 2.5 percent, falling back slightly from a remarkable 30 percent rise this week alone.The 10-year Treasury note was unchanged at 100 9/32 with the yield unchanged at 3.96 percent.'"

Of those who cast a ballot, about 74 percent voted in favor of the proposal.Workers are expected to return to Boeing’s commercial airplane factories, which have been closed since the walkout on Sept. 6, starting Sunday night.The union has said the new contract protects more than 5,000 factory jobs, prevents the outsourcing of certain positions and preserves health care benefits. It also promises pay increases over four years rather than three, as outlined in previous offers.The union members, including electricians, painters, mechanics and other production workers, have lost an average of about $7,000 in base pay since the strike began.

"'08-11-02,'0','Ever since Sept. 11, 2001, the world has shuddered at the possibility of loose nuclear weapons or radioactive material falling into the hands of terrorists. Shuddered and done too little to stop it.Mohamed ElBaradei, the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, warned last week that there has been a “disturbingly high” number of reports of missing or illegally trafficked nuclear material. According to agency figures, there were 243 incidents between June 2007 and June of this year. Fortunately, the amounts reported missing have been small. Some experts say that if all the material were lumped together it would not be enough for one nuclear weapon. That is no consolation in a world where so many countries are eager to build their own nuclear reactors and possibly nuclear weapons.That means that in coming years there will be even more states with nuclear materials, more scientists with nuclear knowledge and more opportunities for terrorists to get their hands on the material for a bomb.It is the atomic agency’s job to keep tabs on civilian nuclear programs, to ensure that states do not misplace fuel or divert it to clandestine weapons programs. One way to guard against such a perilous future is to ensure that the agency is fully staffed with the best people available and has the money and support it needs.Member states must be willing to increase their budget contributions so the agency can refurbish its testing laboratory, invest in new technology and hire additional nuclear experts. The agency must also be ready to take on new tasks, like administering a nuclear fuel bank to be the supplier of last resort for countries that choose not to get into the risky reactor fuel business. (Producing nuclear fuel is the hardest part of building a nuclear weapon.)Mr. ElBaradei completes his term at the end of 2009. His successor must be knowledgeable, politically skilled — but less likely to give Iran the benefit of the doubt at crucial moments — and ready to help lead a global campaign to secure dangerous nuclear materials and constrain the world’s nuclear appetites.'"

"'08-11-02,'0','Roger Lowenstein (Oct.19) concedes the reckless role of speculators in driving up gasoline prices to over $4 a gallon. But he does not condemn that drive. He, too, wants high gas prices: not for exploitative gains, of course, but to support the development of alternative fuels within the U.S. at higher costs than gasoline. His “contrarian” proposal is a floor-type tax, to kick in only if oil prices fall below a set level of support.Unfortunately, Lowenstein’s proposal dooms the consumers again to bear the high prices, while the oil-company executives still get overcompensation and the foreign suppliers get big gains. Perhaps the floor tax should be rebated to low-income consumers, and an excess-profits tax applied to the oil companies.The chief alternative is substantial government subsidies to the various alternative fuels, together with government intervention (especially by imposing steep “transaction” fees) against speculative pricing that is just pure profiteering.I take strong exception to Lowenstein’s comment that there is no reason to rule out any energy source — oil included. There is a very good reason, and it is global warming. We need to phase out oil, not burn it just because we can. The only mechanisms that work are strong incentives to wind, solar and perhaps nuclear and strong disincentives for burning oil and coal.'"
"'08-11-02,'0','When the vault of the 43rd presidency is sealed, it will include, among many things, evidence of President Bush’s virtue.— ROBERT DRAPER, a correspondent for GQ and the author of “Dead Certain: The Presidency of George W. Bush”I’ll miss President Bush’s moral clarity. The president’s critics hated his willingness to label things right or wrong, and the press used to bang me around for it, but history will show how right he was.Shortly after 9/11, the president gave a speech in which he talked about the fight between good and evil, and that good would win. Afterward, I told him I thought he was being simplistic: “There are a lot of shades of gray in this war. I think it’s more nuanced.”He looked at me and said, “If this isn’t good versus evil, what is?”Then he reminded me that when Ronald Reagan went to Berlin, he called on Mikhail Gorbachev to “tear down this wall” — not to put a gate in it or to remove some bricks. Mr. Reagan said to tear it all down.Mr. Bush saw the presidency as the place to call the American people to big challenges — in morally clear terms. As his spokesman, I knew that many people would be uncomfortable with how easily he made such moral judgments. I also knew that many Americans welcomed his tough, direct and unambiguous moral clarity.I’ll miss that direct talk. In the age of terrorism, the one thing we have to fear more than anything is moral relativism.When Israel was attacked during the Bush years, the president always stated that Israel had a right to defend itself. After 9/11, he never referred to Israel’s counterattacks as a “cycle of violence.” He understood that when a democracy strikes back against terrorists, it’s not a “cycle.” It’s self-defense.We haven’t been attacked since 9/11, Libya no longer has nuclear weapons, Syria was stopped from acquiring them, Saddam Hussein is gone, and Iraq is on its way to being a nation that fights terrorism — all on President Bush’s watch. His job approval may now be low, but he should leave office with his head held high. I hope his successors recognize the strength that moral clarity can provide.— ARI FLEISCHER, the White House press secretary from 2001 to 2003During the last eight years, when I’ve mentioned to people that I’m completely fascinated by Laura Bush, most think I’m kidding. They see her as a traditional wife and mother, a gracious and well-mannered conservative. And while this might, depending upon whom you ask, be an admirable description, it doesn’t tend to prompt fascination. Oh, I say, but there’s so much more to her!Among my favorite facts: She spent her 20s working at ethnically diverse, low-income schools and was a Democrat until she married George Bush at the age of 31 — after knowing him just 12 weeks. As first lady of Texas, she’d eat at hole-in-the-wall Mexican restaurants, shop at Wal-Mart and fly Southwest Airlines to visit friends. In the White House, in addition to organizing literary events that featured writers who have publicly disagreed with her husband’s policies, she has been far more politically involved than people realize — traveling to Africa and the Middle East to raise awareness for, respectively, AIDS and breast cancer, and advocating for the opposition leader of Myanmar, who has long been under house arrest.Of course, what’s most intriguing to Democrats like me are the suggestions that Mrs. Bush might still be considerably less conservative than her husband: She has said that she does not think Roe v. Wade should be overturned. Asked in 2004 whether she and the president have gay friends, she told a reporter, “Sure, of course. Everyone does.” And earlier this year, Mrs. Bush spoke publicly of her admiration for Hillary Clinton’s “grit and strength.”I will miss Mrs. Bush not only for keeping me guessing but also for seeming like an intelligent and compassionate presence in a White House not widely recognized for its intelligence or compassion — for being the one person in there whom I’m pretty sure a lot of us would like even more if only we knew her better.— CURTIS SITTENFELD, the author of the novel “American Wife”I was listening to George W. Bush speak at a rally in New Hampshire, in January 2000, when he came up with what remains my favorite of his miscues: “I know how hard it is to put food on your family.” This could be an amusing few months, I remember thinking.The only slow period for Bushisms was right after Sept. 11, when the president’s inadequacies no longer seemed very funny. Then Mr. Bush declared that normality was returning: “I am here to make an announcement that this Thursday, ticket counters and airplanes will fly out of Ronald Reagan Airport.”The president’s critics see such flubs as proof of his idiocy. His defenders believe that calling attention to them is hostile. But the president’s verbal stumbles have only made me like him better. It’s hard to despise someone who just wants “to make the pie higher” or who says he won’t answer your question, “Neither in French nor in English. Nor in Mexican.”Maybe the greatest expression of his befuddlement was something he said when asked to respond to an article by the writer Gail Sheehy claiming he was an undiagnosed dyslexic. “The woman who knew that I had dyslexia — I never interviewed her,” he sputtered.Mr. Bush’s battle with English has enriched our political language. It is no longer possible to say a person or a factor has been underestimated. Thanks to him, that word is now misunderestimated. In trade negotiations, tariffs and barriers have become bariffs and terriers. Kosovo is the land of the Kosovians, Greece the ancient homeland of the Grecians, a Reagan-loving people with no gray hair. There is no strategy, only “strategery,” a term coined by the comedian Will Ferrell and adopted inside the administration.Most politicians don’t care about language and abuse it through euphemism, vagueness and cliché. Mr. Bush is not so indifferent. When words won’t do what he wants, he tries to wrestle them into submission. His memorable coinages — Hispanically, arbo-treeist — express the frustration we all feel at those moments when language won’t go our way. In the face of defeat, Mr. Bush remains unbowed by grammar. You’ve got to admire that, kind of.— JACOB WEISBERG, the editor in chief of the Slate Group and the author of “The Bush Tragedy”What I will miss most about George W. Bush as president is his sincere concern for promoting human dignity.I was at his side when he met with defectors from North Korean forced-labor camps, listened to firsthand accounts of the unconscionable atrocities Saddam Hussein committed, shared the elation of women freed from the injustices of the Taliban, worked to dramatically increase government funding to combat AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria in Africa, and pressed other world leaders to stop genocide in Darfur. The compassion President Bush showed for the oppressed and suffering in these moments was inspiring.It also helped obscure his flaws to those of us who worked for him, making it difficult for us to realize that his presidency was veering off course.While he did not always choose wisely in his efforts to advance human dignity, his motives were genuine. And in those somber moments when he visited wounded troops or families of those who’d made the ultimate sacrifice, I saw — ever so briefly — a glimmer of self-doubt.President Bush bears responsibility for the consequences of the war he chose to wage in Iraq. But alongside his profound flaws and the mistakes he made, I can also see and respect his inner decency. Let’s hope the next president will share his passion for human dignity — and also find ways to express it with greater wisdom and judgment.— SCOTT McCLELLAN, the White House press secretary from 2003 to 2006 and the author of “What Happened: Inside the Bush White House and Washington’s Culture of Deception”I feel nostalgic about the person I knew as Gov. George W. Bush. I miss that guy. He was the best politician I ever saw. He really was “a uniter, not a divider.” He refused to kowtow to the far right. He worked with Democrats to strengthen public education, while Republicans were pushing vouchers. He had four vacancies on the Texas Supreme Court and he filled them all with centrist judges. The extreme right wing of the Republican Party was his enemy, not his ally. His administration was untainted by scandal. Karl Rove remained an outside consultant rather than a gubernatorial staffer.But when he reached the White House, Governor Bush vanished, to be replaced by President George W. Bush — a person I didn’t recognize. He was never to return.'"
"'08-11-02,'0','“I don’t like those guys; I know they don’t like us,” Wright said of the Phillies.He added: “I’m not a big fan of the teams in our division just because we play them so much. I would hope as a competitor that you have that edge where you have a genuine interest in going out there and beating them as badly as you possibly can. I think that we can get better in that category. I think that we can get better as far as having that killer instinct, that killer attitude.”Implicit in those remarks was his dissatisfaction with his own performance over the final two weeks. By hitting .397 during the Mets’ final 17 games in 2007, Wright was largely immune from blame. This season, he hit nearly as well during the same stretch (.354) but seemed to lock up with runners in scoring position, hitting .200. He acknowledged at the time that he was putting too much pressure on himself.The prime example came Sept. 24, in the ninth inning of an eventual loss to the Chicago Cubs. With the potential winning run on third base and no outs, Wright drew a 3-0 count but eventually struck out swinging on a pitch that was high and outside. Over all, Wright hit .243 with runners in scoring position despite having the most at-bats (189) of anyone in that situation, according to Stats LLC. Wright hit .302 over all in 2008.“I can look back on the season and say I went out there and I prepared the way I should have,” Wright said. “Did I always get the job done? Absolutely not.”He continued: “But as far as preparation, as far as the desire to win, I have that. Put it this way: I’d rather take the brunt of the heat and place it on my shoulders — people place it on my shoulders because I put a lot of pressure on myself to begin with — than to place it on other people’s shoulders.”Because he is candid and talented and plays hard, Wright is perhaps the most admired player on the Mets. He loves playing and living in New York and is signed through 2012, with a team option for 2013. With a smile, he said that he did not listen to talk radio and, thus, had only heard from friends of the scattered cries by fans to break up the team’s core — Wright, José Reyes and Carlos Beltrán.Perhaps not surprisingly, Wright is opposed to a shake-up. Instead, he challenged himself and his teammates to increased leadership roles and, as Manager Jerry Manuel said after he was officially hired, to take a more unselfish approach at the plate.Maybe, he said, that will send the Mets into the Phillies’ stratosphere. Then, at this time next year, they can mock the Phillies all they want.'"
"'08-11-02,'0','Supporters of Senator John McCain held a similar drive at the campaign’s regional headquarters in Woodbridge, N.J., a 40-minute drive from Midtown.About a dozen New Yorkers, most of them from Staten Island, made the trip last weekend, according to Stephanie Fila, the volunteer coordinator. On Monday night, supporters of Senator McCain filled the phone room in Woodbridge, pounding out Pennsylvania and New Jersey area codes on 18 black office phones. They sat close together at folding tables. Photographs of the senator, snapshots of volunteers and a large banner — “Small Business Leaders for McCain” — decorated the walls.“On Tuesday nights, it’s Veterans Calling Veterans, and I come to that, too,” said Jim Bellina, 55, of Skillman, N.J., who served in the Navy. He said he was confident despite polls showing his candidate trailing. “Let me put it this way: This is the fourth quarter in a football game, and we’re having a tough time. But if you know Senator McCain, you know he ain’t got no quit.”If history, voting registration and polls are any indication, New York City will vote Democratic in Tuesday’s presidential election, as it has every time since 1924, when Calvin Coolidge, a Republican, pulled out a victory in a three-way race that saw Democratic voters siphoned off by the Progressive Party.As of March 1, there were 2.8 million registered Democrats in the city, compared with a little more than half a million Republicans, according to the most recent numbers from the Board of Elections. The goal for strategists of both parties is to marshal strong supporters here to change minds and get out the vote in swing states.“We’re seeking to harness the enthusiasm in New York to help out in other states,” said Blake Zeff, the director of communications for the Obama campaign in New York. More than 3,000 volunteers made roughly 180,000 calls last weekend, according to statistics provided by the campaign.For this final weekend, the Obama campaign said it would be ramping up its “Last Call for Change” effort, creating a handful of supersize phone banks to accommodate hundreds of callers, in addition to more than 20 smaller sites.In Woodbridge, where more than 200,000 calls have been made for Senator McCain, they will be hammering away until Election Day, according to the campaign. New York supporters of Senator McCain, however, will not find any official phone banks in the city, though they might happen upon the candidate himself on his way from Rockefeller Center to New Hampshire on Sunday morning after his scheduled appearance on “Saturday Night Live.”The campaign is likewise encouraging supporters to head to the battleground state of Pennsylvania to knock on doors.With the end nearing, the emotions of voters on both sides seemed to be gathering strength. Some described having troubled sleep and even more troubling dreams.“I had a dream the other night that Obama won, and I woke up so happy,” said Melissa Gluck, 30, of Forest Hills, Queens, who came with a friend to Ms. Sibblies’s house to make calls. “But then, I felt a sense of panic.”At a much larger phone event for Senator Obama, at the Bowery Hotel, Ralph Stern, 83, also said he had lost sleep over the impending election.“I get a little shaky,” he said, making calls with his wife, Arlene, at a wicker table in the lobby. “I get panicky.”Jamie Lynn, 27, a waitress and college student who lives in Woodbridge, was making calls on behalf of Senator McCain. She said that for three nights she had been “having trouble sleeping, nightmares” about what would happen if Senator Obama was elected. In her dream, there were riots, she said. She had been making calls every weekday for two weeks and would continue until the election.No one seemed nervous about making dozens of cold calls to strangers in faraway towns. “What’s the worst that could happen?” said Edward Bishop, 63, of Monroe Township, N.J. “They hang up on you.”“Or,” he added, “I guess they could say they’re voting for Obama.”'"
"'08-11-02,'0','For the third year in a row — and despite not coming close to breaking a 41-year Stanley Cup championship drought — the Toronto Maple Leafs topped Forbes Magazine’s list of most valuable N.H.L. franchises for 2008.Forbes released its annual list on Wednesday, which valued the Maple Leafs at $448 million. The Rangers came in at No. 2, also for the third straight year, with a value of $411 million.Montreal’s value jumped 18 percent in the past year to move into third place at $334 million, hopping over last year’s No. 3 Detroit ($303 million).One of the most notable movers on the list from a year ago is the Devils, who improved to 10th from 13th and are valued at $222 million. That is largely because they moved into their own arena, Prudential Center, in Newark last season.Franchise values, according to Forbes, are based largely on the value of the arenas — which is why the top teams own or control the arena they play in — as well as local television revenue.Nashville made a big jump, pulling itself up from last place a year ago to 23rd now under new ownership. That is a curious development considering that just three weeks ago, Forbes included the Predators on its top 10 list of sports franchises most likely to move. The other N.H.L. teams on that list were the Islanders (ranked 29th in value at $154 million) and Phoenix (30th at $142 million).Toronto’s spectacular financial performance belies its on-ice failures. The Maple Leafs have not won the Stanley Cup since 1967 and have not made the playoff field in the three seasons since the N.H.L. lockout. They do, however, have the best revenue-producing arena, the Air Canada Centre, and best local television revenues. They also have the league’s most unusual ownership, the Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan.Forbes said that value of the Canadian teams had improved largely because of the strength of the Canadian dollar, which has increased 15 percent relative to the United States dollar over the past year. Those gains, however, may be fleeting because the Canadian dollar has begun to suffer in the recent global financial crisis. Forbes said the valuations were made as of Oct. 19.It started innocently enough. One of the Florida football players stumbled upon “Luke and Skip’s Football Fundamentals” while cruising around on YouTube. Luke and Skip are really two Furman football players, the fifth-year senior Chris Rogers and the recent graduate Patrick Sprague. They have a series of YouTube videos spoofing the accents and techniques of a few of the Furman coaches.And after one Florida player showed it to another and to another, soon enough, the assistants were cracking up while watching it.Florida quarterback Tim Tebow brought the videos up on Sunday when I was watching film with him and the offensive coordinator Dan Mullen. While Mullen played dumb, Tebow wouldn’t let him get away with it.“Don’t let him act like he doesn’t know it,” Tebow said. “He quotes it all the time. He quotes it all the time.”Tebow used Luke and Skip to show how Mullen toggles the fine line between serious film study and still being able to laugh with his quarterbacks.In 2005, with the home fans going crazy in Houston, Brad Lidge was one out from clinching the National League pennant. You know what happened next: Albert Pujols, and the homer that landed near Oklahoma.Lidge answered all the questions, accepted all the blame. And when the Astros reached the World Series anyway, and he lost two games, he again took responsibility. His manager, Phil Garner, pulled him from the closer’s role at various points the next two years.How much did his Astros’ experience sit with Lidge? “Honestly, it was never a part of this,” he said on Wednesday, in the delirious Phillies’ clubhouse, after striking out Tampa Bay’s Eric Hinske to win the World Series.“It was never part of the year for me. Other people have trouble turning the page, but I didn’t. This year was always about the Phillies and these guys on my team, and the surroundings here, the fans. It was an incredible blessing for me in my life to be traded here. I actually wouldn’t change anything in my career, absolutely, because it’s all leading right here, right now.”The trade will go down as one of the finest in Phillies history: Lidge and outfielder Eric Bruntlett from Houston for outfielder Michael Bourn, pitcher Geoff Geary and third baseman Mike Costanzo. It was the greatest gift from Houston to the Phillies since Harry Kalas jumped from the Astros’ broadcast booth to Philadelphia in 1971.Ed Wade, the Houston general manager, had overseen the building of the Phillies’ core, and wanted Bourn. He acquired a closer of his own, José Valverde, and the Astros made a nice late-season run. But the Phillies, and Lidge, won it all.'"
"'08-11-02,'0','NASHUA, N.H. — New Hampshire propelled Senator John McCain toward his party’s nomination this year, and his campaign hoped that his nonconformist brand of Republicanism would be an easy sell for the general election. In recent weeks, however, Senator Barack Obama, the Democratic presidential nominee, has taken a commanding lead in polls here.Still, New Hampshire voters are a capricious bunch, as Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton’s surprise victory over Mr. Obama in the Democratic primary proved. Mr. Obama had a double-digit lead in some polls going into the primary, in January, and his startling defeat is reason for some to believe that Mr. McCain still has a shot. To that end, he is returning to the state this weekend. “New Hampshire has given him life support twice,” said Jennifer Donahue, political director of the New Hampshire Institute of Politics at St. Anselm College.Despite New Hampshire’s longtime affection for Mr. McCain, the state has been trending Democratic for years.Research by the University of New Hampshire Survey Center suggests that a third of the state’s electorate is new since 2000, when George W. Bush defeated Al Gore here. The research found that more than half of these new voters are Democrats.So why should Mr. McCain bother returning to the state? “His theme of Obama meaning higher taxes really resonates here,” Ms. Donahue said. “No matter what the polls say the week before the election, New Hampshire voters make their final decision in the last three days. McCain knows it, and that’s why he’s coming back.”Democrats, too, think the race is closer than it seems. One of Mr. Obama’s highest-profile surrogates, former President Bill Clinton, is to campaign here Sunday. And in a separate visit last week, Mrs. Clinton warned Democrats not to get complacent.'"
"'08-11-02,'0','Senator John McCain has opted for the tried and true for his election night party: the Arizona Biltmore Resort and Spa, a semi-secluded, exquisitely manicured spot that is to Phoenix what the Waldorf-Astoria is to New York.The Biltmore, whose architecture was inspired by Frank Lloyd Wright and is noted for its gilded lobby ceiling and geometric concrete blocks, splays out in one of the city’s most expensive neighborhoods.It has played host to political functions since it opened in 1929 during the Hoover administration, and every president since then has stayed there. Irving Berlin wrote “White Christmas” by one of its eight pools, according to hotel lore.Like many couples before and after them, John and Cindy McCain had their wedding reception there.Mr. McCain held his Super Tuesday victory party there in February, swelling a ballroom to the brim.But the campaign said Tuesday will be different. While the typical large ballroom crowd is planned, Mr. McCain will head outdoors for his principal address, before an anticipated 2,000 supporters on a lawn framed by Camelback Mountain.'"

"'08-11-02,'0','In tough economic times, having a satisfying meal out is a pleasure that many people forgo, but it need not be so. With this column, Good Eating begins an occasional series focusing on affordable restaurants in some of the city’s popular dining destinations. The first is the West 80s.Formerly Rain, a pan-Asian spot, Bar Bao has been made over with a sweeping bar in the lounge and another, for food, in the dining room. Michael Bao Huynh, the executive chef, offers an interpretive Vietnamese menu that moves from small bites in rolls and on skewers to clay pot and noodle dishes.Bloomingdale Road inhabits the multilevel space Aix vacated, which has been given an airy, warm look. The menu emphasizes small and larger plates to be shared, and finger food. There are creamy smoked deviled eggs, and country ham splashed with Coca-Cola. Main courses include pan-roasted chicken with sweet potato purée and a grilled pork chop with cheese grits.Celeste is that rare bird: a true neighborhood restaurant. The atmosphere is convivial. The staff is pleasant and efficient. And the food is sublime. Start with a pizza, ideally the bracing and authentic Napoletana, which builds upon its crust with layers of flavor: sweet tomato, acidic caper, salty anchovy.Eighty One takes its name from its street and is opposite the American Museum of Natural History, off the lobby of the Excelsior Hotel. Ed Brown’s contemporary American menu now includes an affordable two-course dinner for $42 with options like French lentil soup with foie gras royale, and organic Scottish salmon.Land Thai Kitchen serves Thai food that is accessible, never greasy and on occasion interesting. Spring rolls, stuffed with an unorthodox mélange of root vegetables like beets and parsnips, are served with plum sauce. An order of classic satay — grilled skewers of chicken, beef and lamb with peanut sauce — with a Singha beer is a good way to shake off the workday.'"
"'08-11-02,'0','“In its day in the ’50s and ’60s, the Fontainebleau was state of the art in glamour,” said Jeffrey Beers, the New York architect responsible for an extensive update of the interior. “We would like to restore that in spirit.”When the refurbished resort is officially unveiled on Nov. 14 with a series of parties and a taping for television of a Victoria’s Secret fashion show — perfect! — visitors will be able to judge for themselves if the mission succeeded. Even recently, as the hotel was still a construction site, it was clear that the old duchess had flounced out her skirts.“How many places like this can you go in America that are not in the desert?” said Jeffrey Soffer, executive chairman and majority partner of Fontainebleau Resorts, which is building a Fontainebleau in Las Vegas. Indeed, as he strolled the raised oceanfront walkway that overlooks the property, it was obvious the resort had much in common with over-the-top hotels on the Strip.Visible from the walkway is a pool complex fanning out across the lawns, and a new 40,000-square-foot glass-walled spa, its steam rooms and reflecting pools worthy of the emperor Hadrian. Crescent-shaped rows of cabanas edge the pools and echo the undulating outlines of the Chateau, the hotel’s original building.Several towers, two of them new, flank the Chateau, for a combined 1,500 guest rooms, twice the number of the Fontainebleau’s largest competitor, Loews in South Beach. There are also shops, 11 restaurants and lounges, and about 200,000 square feet of meeting and convention space — all sprawling over 22 acres.The three-year renovation was conceived, in part, to lure back fashionable crowds, which have drifted down to South Beach.With renovated rooms from $399 and suites from $509, the Fontainebleau is reopening at a challenging time for tourism. Hotel occupancy rates in Miami-Dade County were down by 6 percent in September from a year earlier, and room revenues fell by 4 percent, said John Lancet, a senior executive in Miami for HVS, a national hotel consulting company.But Mr. Lancet viewed the Fontainebleau development as only mildly risky. “It is my impression that the owners went through adequate planning so that the risk could be mitigated,” he said.THE hotel has some $30 million in bookings through early next year, said Howard C. Karawan, the chief operating officer of Fontainebleau Resorts, who was brought in by the new owners to oversee renovations and operations for the company.Rumors are widespread that the $500 million face-lift was made in anticipation that the city would legalize casino gambling. The developers deny this, and gambling has yet to win acceptance with local lawmakers.At the hub of the resort is the Chateau’s 45,000-square-foot lobby, an elaboration on the original free-form elliptical shape completed by Lapidus in 1954.Its original curvaceous outlines were accentuated by three enormous chandeliers, striated Greek-style columns, swirling carpets and a mural of a Piranesi print. The lobby’s famous focal point was a “staircase to nowhere,” which actually led from a discreet cloakroom, where ladies could shed their wraps before descending divalike down the white marble steps.The new lobby, like its predecessor, is a chambered nautilus, all undulating walls and recesses. Mr. Beers stripped away ’70s-era carpeting to expose the original marble floor with its signature bow tie design. He covered the wall at the staircase in gold tile and added a light installation by the artist James Turrell and a lounge with a blue reflective floor. The staircase to nowhere is back, the jewel in a set piece expected to draw crowds who want to see and be seen.And perhaps to retrace the footsteps of previous guests. Those who stayed at the hotel in Miami Beach’s golden age recall a resort that Lapidus, who died in 2001 at 98, had envisioned as a laboratory. It was a place, he wrote, “where I could enlarge upon all the theories I had been developing about human nature and the emotional hunger that the average man had for visual excitement.”At bars and supper clubs — the Gigi Room, the Poodle Lounge — “women would sit with their little fur stoles and white gloves on to eat,” recalled Deborah Desilets, a Miami architect and former associate of Lapidus. Sheathed in slinky gowns, “they would stop at the mezzanine, put on their jewelry and wave at their husbands in the lobby below,” she said.Michele Oka Doner, an artist and a frequent guest as a girl — her father, Kenneth Oka, was mayor of Miami Beach in the late ’50s and early ’60s — remembers the resort, where she had a prom and her wedding, “as my stage and my launching pad.”The Fontainebleau was a decadent paradise of “flashy diamonds, illicit sex and overflowing ice cream sodas,” she said. To get to her family’s cabana, “you had to walk through the downstairs shops and past a dance studio where they had all these gorgeous guys giving cha-cha lessons to all these overdressed matrons from Scarsdale.”“People came for the half-naked girls and the revues,” she said. And, of course, for trysts. “I knew something illicit was going on, but I couldn’t put my finger on what it was.”The lobby was a hub for celebrity spotting, the hotel itself a backdrop against which the Rat Pack played poker and James Bond received a massage at a poolside cabana in “Goldfinger.”“The floor was like a mirror, so shiny you could see yourself,” said Levi Forte, a bellman at the Fontainebleau since the ’60s. “Danny Thomas couldn’t keep his eyes off that floor. He’d sit there and comb his hair and ask, ‘Levi, how do I look?’ ”Mel Dick, who moved to Miami from Brooklyn in the ’60s, visited on his honeymoon. He recalled being drawn to a sign outside the hotel barbershop that beckoned, “Come and have your shoes shined by the former lightweight champion of the world.” It was Sidney Walker, known as Beau Jack, recalled Mr. Dick, a wine company executive. “I sat down in the seat and I gave him five dollars. I told him: ‘I don’t want you to shine my shoes. I just want to look at you.’ ”Mrs. Rubinson was just as enthralled by her frequent star sightings. “How many times driving up to the Fontainebleau I would see Frank Sinatra walking up the drive with a glass in his hand,” she said.“We had a more glamorous lifestyle in those days,” she added wistfully. “But then, of course, things changed.”In succeeding decades the resort lost its sparkle. Like other supersize hotels lining Collins Avenue north of 44th Street, including the neighboring Eden Roc, another shiny Lapidus edifice, it became as dated as Grandma’s minaudière.Fast forward to the current renovation. “We kept asking ourselves, ‘What would Morris do?’ ” Mr. Karawan said.John Nichols, a Miami architect responsible for the adjacent Fontainebleau residential towers, the second of which has just been completed, was hired to gut and redesign the hotel. He preserved Lapidus embellishments like the perforated “Swiss cheese” outer walls. “We had to get down into a very high level of detail,” Mr. Nichols said. “You don’t just go in there and take off the eyebrows.”Ms. Oka Doner admires the renovation, to a point. “The property is kind of post-postmodern,” she said. “Morris Lapidus had real passion,” but in its current incarnation, “irony has trumped passion.”But Ms. Desilets, the former Lapidus associate, who visited the site last month, was over the moon. “They used incredible engineering to laser trace what was there and rebuilt it with accuracy,” she said. “It’s going to be like a Ravenna mosaic. It’s a wow type of extravagance.”The exuberant aesthetic of the original has been resurrected in three ballrooms, lavish restaurants and five swimming and reflecting pools.The pool cabanas have wraparound sofas and flat-panel televisions. Perched on the property’s topmost tier is a V.I.P. pool deck with six additional teak cabanas, a bar and a D.J. booth.Mr. Forte, the bellman, recently viewed the improvements. “The place is so pretty, the first time I saw it I thought I was in the wrong hotel,” he said. “I said to my wife, ‘Just take a look at what money can do.’ ”'"
"'08-11-02,'0','The local races on Tuesday’s ballot provide an opportunity to choose government leaders who determine everything from tax policies to government spending to road repairs. But the local elections may have an impact beyond Westchester, with control of the State Senate at stake. The Republicans have a slim edge there.The 35th District race is one of two in Westchester that the Republican Party is pouring money into as part of its bid to retain a Senate majority. In the past three weeks, the Republican Campaign Committee spent $3.2 million on Senate races, according to campaign filings.Elizabeth N. Feld, 47, a Republican who is the mayor of Larchmont, had received $184,942 from the state party in her 37th District Senate race against the 12-term incumbent, Suzi Oppenheimer, 73, whose campaign received $123,776 in Democratic financial support.Republicans had also spent $269,527 on Mr. Murtagh’s campaign, said Joseph E. Conway, a Republican campaign spokesman, far more than the Democrats’ infusion of $10,320 for Ms. Stewart-Cousins.“This is a critically important election,” Mr. Conway said. “John Murtagh is a powerful leader who works hard and knows how to connect with voters.”Two years ago Ms. Stewart-Cousins, 58, won a Senate seat long held by the Republicans. Her campaign this time has the support of Gov. David A. Paterson, whom she described as a friend and ally. “He is very involved and paid close attention to this district,” she said. She said successes in her two-year term include the continued operation of the Dobbs Ferry Community Hospital; she fought its scheduled closing. “That was huge,” she said. “That facility stayed open and saved hundreds of jobs.”The tax burden remains a core theme, Ms. Stewart-Cousins said. She said she did not support the property tax cap favored by Mr. Murtagh but would consider a tax linked to income instead of property value.Like Ms. Stewart-Cousins, Mr. Murtagh, 48, said belt-tightening was essential for state government. “The reality is that there is no sense of control on state spending in Albany at all,” he said.Mr. Murtagh, who also practices law and teaches law and public policy at the Fordham University College of Liberal Studies, described himself as “an equal opportunity finger pointer” when it came to state spending. “I hold both sides responsible,” he said.He said the elimination of government waste and fraud was a priority, including in areas like Medicaid. Spending on member items, known as earmarks, should be curtailed, he said. “It’s a massive amount of money that is handed out without oversight,” he said.In two terms as a Yonkers councilman, Mr. Murtagh wrote a stringent ethics code for the city. As a citizen, he lobbied successfully for term limits for the city administration, including for members of the City Council and mayor’s office.She lost her first Senate race, in 2004, by just 18 votes and then defeated the incumbent, Nicholas A. Spano, by 2,200 votes in 2006. “When I ran in 2004, I ran against all odds,” she said. “I always understood it was not going to be easy.”Mr. Murtagh has a tie to Senator John McCain campaign’s strategy of linking Senator Barack Obama to William Ayers, a founder of the radical Weather Underground, which claimed responsibility for bombing the Pentagon, the Capitol and several other buildings — including Mr. Murtagh’s childhood home. He described awakening to flames early one morning when he was 9 after three gasoline-filled firebombs exploded at his home. The intended target, he said, was his father, John Murtagh Sr., a New York State Supreme Court justice who was presiding over a trial involving members of the Black Panther Party.That incident was cited in a press release issued last month by the McCain campaign. “I quickly learned what Andy Warhol meant about 15 minutes of fame,” Mr. Murtagh said.The economy has been at the forefront of Congressional races as well.Nita M. Lowey, 71, a Democrat who represents the 18th Congressional District, which includes portions of Westchester and Rockland Counties, told the crowd at the Yonkers library that “the most important thing we need to do is stabilize the economy.”She is being challenged by the Republican Jim Russell, 54, a computer consultant from Hawthorne. His main campaign themes include fiscal control and immigration control. He said he is opposed to military aid to any foreign country.John Hall, 60, the first-term Democrat representing the 19th District, which includes parts of Westchester, is being challenged by Kieran Lalor, 32, a Republican from Peekskill who is a former marine and served in Kuwait and Iraq. Mr. Hall, chairman of the Veterans’ Subcommittee on Disability Assistance and Memorial Affairs, has sponsored legislation related to veterans’ disability benefits, including a bill signed into law by President Bush last month aimed at overhauling the disability claims bureaucracy.Adelaide DiGiorgi, vice president of the League of Women Voters of Westchester, said turnout at local political events had been higher than ever. But high turnout does not necessarily translate into voting in local races, said Steven Greenberg, a spokesman for the Siena New York Poll. He said there can be a 5 to 15 percent falloff, particularly in a presidential year when first-time voters ride a wave of participatory excitement over the top names, but do not vote in local races that are farther down the ballot.“There is definitely a category of voters that come in and vote for the president and then leave the booth,” Mr. Greenberg said.'"
"'08-11-02,'0','“There’s ample parking on the street — I had no problem at all,” said Chris Kunstadter, 53, of Bloomfield. Mr. Kunstadter received e-mail notification of the postponement in time to avoid heading out on Monday, but when he made it inside on Tuesday, he had a different concern.“They should have seating on the lower level,” he said, referring to the capacious open space near the main stage, where clumps of concertgoers convened. For this concert, seats were available only on the Wellmont’s upper tier.“On the Web site, it shows a seating plan” for the lower level, Mr. Kunstadter said. The theater’s managers say they will be bringing in seats for certain shows.Shawn Savage, 26, of Wanaque, complained that the Wellmont’s three bars were charging “Manhattan prices” for beer: “They could bring it down a buck or two,” he said. Nancy Livingston, 39, of Bloomfield, called the theater’s interior “industrial and unfinished-looking.” Most recently a movie triplex, the Wellmont dates to 1922. In comments on the Web site Baristanet, some other concertgoers complained that it was chilly inside.The theater, which accommodates up to 2,500, secured 800 parking spots in three lots several days before the opening. The deal was struck by Andy Feltz, 50, of Montclair Entertainment LLC, a new concert promotion company in partnership with the Bowery Presents, a New York-based group that owns the Bowery Ballroom and Mercury Lounge. Mr. Feltz ran the Beacon Theater in Manhattan from 1986 to 2006 and is currently presiding over shows at the United Palace Theater, also in Manhattan.“My kids go to school here,” he said. “I’m not going to do anything to upset the town.”The Wellmont’s lineup of boldface names on the way already includes Al Green, Steely Dan, Brian Wilson and John Legend.“I think it’s unreal that we’re getting this kind of venue in Montclair, which is mostly just a town of restaurants and stores,” said Chris Castellani, 33, a Montclair resident and operator of the blog MusicSnobbery. “Probably a lot of people are going to discover that Montclair is a cool place to come and hang out.”The Wellmont’s booker, Anthony Makes, 40, who used to secure bands for the Kodak Theater in Los Angeles, said anyone who thinks that he will be bringing in staid acts for an audience of stiff suburbanites should reconsider the surroundings.“It’s pretty hip around here,” Mr. Makes said, noting that ticket sales for more under-the-radar bands like the Decemberists were already brisk. “This is an audience that knows music.”'"
"'08-11-02,'0','“I categorize this as liquidity protection,” said Oded Ben-Ami, a senior loan officer with the Sterling National Mortgage Company, based in Great Neck, N.Y.Mr. Ben-Ami said he had suggested to mortgage clients that they consider drawing down the maximum amount possible from their home equity credit lines.Which leads to a question: where to put the money?Home equity credit lines usually carry interest rates equal to or slightly lower than the prime lending rate, which banks charge their best customers. Last week, that rate fell to 4 percent as the government looked to stimulate the economy.Those who withdraw their home equity should consider putting the cash into a certificate of deposit, a savings account or a money-market account, Mr. Ben-Ami said.These financial instruments are typically insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. Borrowers can withdraw the money on short notice and pay no penalties in the case of savings or money market accounts, or marginal penalties for early withdrawals from C.D.’s. (Unlike money market accounts, money market funds are not protected if the depository fails.)Short-term liquidity is a key advantage, as borrowers may well be using their credit lines for college tuition bills or as emergency funds if they lose a job or face a major home repair.Interest rates paid by C.D.’s were at least 3 percent last month, Mr. Ben-Ami said. “So on an equity line of $100,000, the annual cost of this strategy is approximately $1,000” — the difference between a cost of 4 percent and income of 3 percent, he said.“The question then is, is it worth it to you to pay $1,000 a year to ensure $100,000 worth of liquidity against the worst of circumstances? For many people, the answer is yes.”There are some risks for borrowers who follow this approach. First, if the value of a home drops significantly and the borrowers have spent the cash from their equity line, they can end up owing more money than their property is worth. (In industry parlance, the borrower is then “under water” or “upside down.”)The prospect of easy money is also a temptation that some borrowers will find difficult to resist. But for those with enough self-restraint not to spend more than they need, withdrawing the full credit line may be easier than having a credit line rescinded and then finding another bank.'"
"'08-11-02,'0','With “A Christmas Tale,” which had its premiere in May at the Cannes Film Festival and is scheduled to open on Nov. 14, Mr. Desplechin transposes this American recipe for seasonal dysfunction into a quintessentially French context. In practice this means cutting out the boring parts and peeling away the veneer of civility. These holiday-reunion movies, he noted, are premised on simmering grudges and secrets, and they reach their dramatic peak with the clatter of skeletons tumbling out of closets.“The confession is supposed to be the climax, but it’s always disappointing,” he said. “The son waits to tell everyone he’s gay, but come on, we’ve already figured that out. I thought it would be nice to have a family where everyone is so harsh that all the forbidden things are said at the beginning, and then we can see where it goes from there.”Accordingly, “A Christmas Tale” abounds with brusque and even baffling declarations. The film opens with the Vuillard patriarch, Abel (Jean-Paul Roussillon), announcing that he “felt no grief” at losing his first-born son, Joseph, who died at 6 of lymphoma. The oldest of the three surviving children, Elizabeth (Anne Consigny), now a depressed, angry playwright, has banished her brother Henri (Mathieu Amalric) from the family. Henri, conceived in the vain hope of finding a compatible marrow donor for Joseph, is the black sheep whose very existence is a reminder of his dead brother. When Henri returns for a Christmas visit after a years-long absence, prompted by the cancer diagnosis of the matriarch, Junon (Catherine Deneuve), mother and son are soon amiably trading cruel insults. (“Still don’t love me?” “I never did.”)With “A Christmas Tale,” Mr. Desplechin revisits many of the themes he laid out in his first film, a 54-minute ensemble drama called “La Vie des Morts” (1991) in which an extended family gathers in the wake of a young man’s suicide attempt. That film was aptly titled. Mr. Desplechin’s movies have often dealt with the life of the dead, whether contemplating the forgotten casualties of the cold war in the paranoid espionage thriller “La Sentinelle” (1992) or the wrenching contents of a hate letter bequeathed by a late father to his daughter in “Kings and Queen.” In “A Christmas Tale,” which takes a particularly literal approach to the Desplechin theme of blood ties, the Vuillards can never escape the specter of mortality. Their children — Elizabeth, Henri and the easygoing Ivan (Melvil Poupaud) — grew up in the shadow of a dead brother and now face the task of saving their mother, who needs a marrow transfusion.Some of the film’s motifs can also be found in Mr. Desplechin’s personal documentary “L’Aimée” (2007), about the selling of his ancestral home in Roubaix, his hometown in the north of France, where “A Christmas Tale” is also set. The film traces the spectral presence of his grandmother, Thérèse, who died when his father, Robert, was 2, and in ways both playful and profound links this relationship between a son and a mother he barely knew to a famous cinematic meditation on memory and loss, Alfred Hitchcock’s “Vertigo” (also invoked in “A Christmas Tale”).Mr. Desplechin acknowledged that there are similarities between “L’Aimée” and “A Christmas Tale,” which he worked on at the same time, but he added: “ ‘L’Aimée’ is about melancholy and mourning, and I could say that ‘A Christmas Tale’ is absolutely the reverse. It’s only brutality. That could be a slogan for this film: No melancholy.”Perhaps so, but almost every other sentiment is accounted for. Mr. Desplechin’s is a cinema of emotional extremes, filled with wild mood swings between love and hate, comedy and savagery. (It’s telling that in describing his own work he has several times brought up jazz and roller coasters.) He prizes density over subtlety, surprise over coherence. While writing he adheres to a principle borrowed from François Truffaut: four ideas per minute. This explains the multiple and sometimes competing layers of meaning in his films, which are routinely described — by critics unaccustomed to this much detail and texture in cinema — as “novelistic.” (His movies are being screened at retrospectives at the IFC Center in New York and the Los Angeles County Museum of Art this week.) He amplifies the moment-to-moment unpredictability with almost free-associative editing, and by directing his actors to abandon stage directions and reinterpret their lines on the spot.“Arnaud gets special things from actors, because he makes the set feel so alive,” said Ms. Deneuve, who first worked with Mr. Desplechin on “Kings and Queen.” “We’re encouraged to be as spontaneous as possible. Sometimes the lines are so heavy that you feel you should say them in a very light way, or the other way around.”Eric Gautier, the cinematographer of “A Christmas Tale” and a regular collaborator of Mr. Desplechin’s since “La Vie des Morts,” also emphasized the importance of alertness. “On Arnaud’s films you never feel you’re in complete control,” said Mr. Gautier, who has become known for the fleet, ultra-responsive style he developed in his movies with Mr. Desplechin, Olivier Assayas and Patrice Chéreau, and is increasingly popular with American auteurs (he shot Sean Penn’s “Into the Wild” and has just finished Ang Lee’s “Taking Woodstock”). “On this film, every time we went back into a room we would light it differently,” Mr. Gautier continued. “It’s always an experiment. You cannot imagine what’s next; you’re always searching.”Artists who believe in the mystique of originality are often reluctant to reveal their inspirations. But the magpielike Mr. Desplechin revels in what the writer Jonathan Lethem has called the ecstasy of influence. “I didn’t invent anything,” he said. “Being a director is not such a grand thing. My job is just to show the audience what I love.”To judge from the tangle of associations in “A Christmas Tale,” there is plenty Mr. Desplechin loves. The bit of raga music, nestled in a score that darts from classical to jazz to hip-hop, is a nod to “The River,” Jean Renoir’s lyrical portrait of family life in colonial India. The puppet play that sketches the Vuillards’ back story was inspired by Kara Walker’s cutout silhouettes. There are also more direct quotes sprinkled throughout: a passage from Nietzsche’s “On the Genealogy of Morals,” a clip of “The Ten Commandments” on television and repeated allusions to Shakespeare’s “Midsummer Night’s Dream” (the 1935 film version and the Mendelssohn overture).Given his giddy grab-bag method, it’s fitting that Mr. Desplechin’s production company is named Why Not (it’s also a phrase he uses often in conversation). Listening to him riff on his approach, you realize that expansive gestures lie behind the smallest details. He gave the most troubled character, Elizabeth’s teenage son, Paul, the Joycean last name Dedalus, which was also the name of the roguish hero, played by Mr. Amalric, in “My Sex Life.” “It was a promise to the character,” Mr. Desplechin said. “A way to say: ‘I’ve already filmed your future. You’re having a hard time now, but one day you will have a life.’ ”Glimpsed in the background, a poster of Terrence Malick’s transcendentalist epic, “The New World,” pays tribute to the influence of Ralph Waldo Emerson. The father Abel’s opening lines are adapted from Emerson’s writings about the death of his firstborn. In a letter to a friend, the poet wrote, “I chiefly grieve that I cannot grieve.”“I’m not sure I understood what he was saying intellectually,” Mr. Desplechin said, “but it sounded poetic. They’re good lines, so I thought the best thing would be to give them to an actor.” Emerson’s inability to mourn became a key to understanding the Vuillards: “It’s a family that contests the idea of sorrow,” he said.All of this might suggest that Mr. Desplechin’s densely allusive films should come with Cliffs Notes. But he contends that they don’t have to be decoded to be understood. He often talks about trying to watch movies as he did when he was 12 — an ideal viewer, more intuitive and open to enchantment than his adult self. “When you are a kid you don’t have to think,” he said. “You can understand it even if you don’t get it.”The sensation of being swept along like a wide-eyed adolescent, lost in an empire of signs, comes across vividly in a letter that Mr. Amalric’s Henri writes to Elizabeth in “A Christmas Tale.” “We’re in the midst of a myth,” he says, “and I don’t know what myth it is,” evoking the bewildering and pleasurable flux not just of an Arnaud Desplechin movie but of life itself.'"
"'08-11-02,'0','BEFORE the latest round of celebrated luxury developments — at 15 Central Park West at West 62nd Street, or the Plaza on Fifth Avenue and Central Park — there were other trophy condominiums, now more or less out of the limelight. With the marketers long gone, prices are lagging.One such project was the Metropolitan, a 32-story building at 181 East 90th Street, at Third Avenue, designed by Philip Johnson in the twilight of his career.The soaring tower provided 360-degree views of Central Park and the surrounding rivers and bridges. The most luxurious apartment, the 32-floor penthouse, was bought by Carol O. McFadden, a frequent name in the society pages, and her husband, George, an investor, soon after the development opened in 2004.They paid $7.9 million for the full-floor apartment and its large terrace. They also bought a separate half-floor apartment, one floor down, for about $4.9 million.But markets winds shift, and tragedy sometimes steps in. In April of this year, Mr. McFadden, a brother of Mary McFadden, the fashion designer, was killed in the crash of a small plane in Texas, and now his wife has put the penthouse up for sale. The smaller apartment was already on the market.While recent buyers at 15 Central Park West have been able to flip their apartments for huge gains, property records show that Ms. McFadden just sold the smaller apartment on the 31st floor for $5.1 million last month, about $200,000, or only 4 percent, more than the couple paid for it.'"
"'08-11-02,'0','WHEN the great market meltdown of 2008 is long over, and our profligate ways return, the sale of the duplex apartment owned by the late Brooke Astor at 778 Park Avenue may be remembered as the great co-op deal of the age.Facing an uncertain and deteriorating real estate market, the bankers, accountants and family members controlling Mrs. Astor’s estate have just slashed the asking price of her apartment, which has 14 rooms, six terraces and five fireplaces, by 26 percent, from the $46 million it was listed at last spring to $34 million.The price reduction, even deeper than the cut rumored only a few days earlier, turned the elegant, if dated, apartment of the grande dame of New York City society, with its links to a more genteel New York, into another kind of real estate product: a co-op priced to sell.Leighton Candler, the broker at the Corcoran Group who has the listing, said the price was marked down to address the lack of confidence and uncertainty in the marketplace. “We didn’t want buyers to say, ‘Let’s wait until it goes down more,’ ” she said. “We didn’t want them to guess how low we can go.”Instead, she said the price cut amounted to “a double discount,” including both the smaller price cut the sellers would normally make about now, and the larger one they might make next spring if the apartment had not sold.'"
"'08-11-02,'0','“Battle stations, people!” Lexi yells. She’s wearing pink pants, a pink cap, pink gloves and a pink-and-white Minnesota Wild hockey jersey that dangles to her knees. Her dark blond hair spills out from under a black helmet.Lexi’s board is about three and a half feet long, and it’s custom made; if it had wheels you would swear it was a skateboard. She and her dad decided that the regular kids’ board provided by Burton Snowboards (her primary sponsor) wasn’t light or flexible enough, so the company designed something better suited to Lexi’s frame.“Dum-da-da-dum,” she cries. Then: “Three, two, one — blast off!” The pink figure slides down the hill, pops off the jump and sails into the air. Hanging over the frozen beach, Lexi makes a precise 180-degree spin while grabbing her board with one hand, then lands with a crash in the snow.“Dad, I’m getting kinda sore,” she says, as Shawn — a burly and affable 34-year-old with a goatee who wears baggy shorts in all weather, “as long as it’s over 30 degrees” — picks her up and lifts her over the fence, depositing her on the snowy hill. “One more and then we eat,” she continues. “Aren’t you guys hungry?”Lexi repeats the trick and slides to a smooth and flawless stop. “You can’t end on a bad note!” she says.A photographer shows her the back of his camera, where an image of her, frozen midjump, is on the screen. Her form is perfect; if you didn’t know who it was in the frame, you’d think you were looking at a fully grown professional.“Sometimes I get scared,” she says, tromping toward the car. “Even pros get scared, you know?” She pauses at a long wooden stair rail that leads from the parking lot down to the beach — Lexi sliding down rails is one of the things the crew would like to capture on film.“I’ll do this one later.”BACK HOME OUTSIDE MINNEAPOLIS, Lexi Roland has her own terrain park, built by her dad. Its features include boxes, rails and a streetlight laid on its side that, in Shawn’s estimation, is “pretty sweet.” Shawn makes his own snow, using a machine provided by one of Lexi’s sponsors. This year, he used so much water that an inspector stopped by. “Dude wanted to know if we had a leak,” Shawn says. When it’s not cold enough to make snow, he drives his trailer over to the local hockey rink and collects the ice shavings. Before he got the snow machine, he made snow with a homemade cannon that combined compressed air and pressurized water, and he hopes someday soon to make a cryogenic snowmaker that uses liquid nitrogen and carbon dioxide. That way, he says cheerfully, “you can make snow at 90 degrees.”Lexi shares the yard with Ethan, her brother, and Poco, the Chihuahua, who hates snow. “That’s his worst enemy,” Lexi says. “His second-worst enemy is the flashlight.” (There are also two ferrets in the family, but they stay inside.) Ethan is 7 and has a mohawk. He snowboards but isn’t as keen on it as Lexi, and Shawn and his wife, Erika, don’t want to pressure him. Instead, the Rolands bought him a drum set. “Maybe that can be his thing,” says Shawn, who works as a freelance marketing consultant. Mama Roland is the primary breadwinner; she does corporate fundraising and pretty much leaves the snowboard coaching to her husband.“I miss Poco and the ferrets,” Lexi says, as we drive around Lake Tahoe scouting terrain. “But my brother, he’s annoying sometimes.” She elbows me in the ribs and jabs at my notebook. “Write another thing here: my dad thinks I talk a lot.”In Minnesota, the Rolands frequent the Hyland Ski and Snowboard Area, a bruise on the landscape with a whopping 175 feet of vertical drop. It’s about 3 minutes away by car or 20 minutes on foot, and Shawn and Lexi go almost every day after school. At Hyland, she runs with what Shawn calls “her posse,” a gaggle of preteen boys that includes Lexi’s closest friend, Willie Borm, a 10-year-old freestyle skier who can land 1080’s (three complete rotations) and took seventh in the under-18 division at the 2008 Junior Olympics. “It’s cool to have another kid on the same level,” Shawn says. “And to have another family to hang around with.”Shawn never set out to raise a snowboarding phenom, he says; it was a total accident. A native of Washington State, he grew so bored during the endless, frigid Minnesota winters that he decided the family needed something they could all do together. The solution: snowboarding.It was almost immediately clear that Lexi had a gift for riding, and by the time she was 6, Shawn was posting videos of her on YouTube. He edited her greatest hits into a highlight reel that he sent to potential sponsors, including Burton. Today she’s the top girl on Burton’s team of junior snowboarders (the only such team in the industry), a collection of 13 miniprodigies known as the Smalls who also serve as technical advisers and models for Burton’s burgeoning line of kids’ clothing and gear.At this stage, there’s almost no money to be made by the Rolands. Burton pays its riders a small stipend for travel, but the Smalls — beholden as they are to schools and parents — are barely a blip on the radar and are known mostly as a novelty. Other than the Olympic gold medalist Shaun White, first noticed at about the same age, there is little precedent for a preteen snowboarder. And given that the sport is still dominated by males at the professional level, a preadolescent female pro is virtually unheard of. “When I put her videos up three years go I couldn’t find another kid on snow under 12,” Shawn says. Today, there are several, but none approaching Lexi’s level of development.It’s tempting to imagine Shawn as a Sports Dad, one of those overbearing parents willing to sacrifice his child’s youth for fame, and I’d be lying if I said I didn’t half-expect to find that. In reality, though, he’s a sweet and mellow guy, an overgrown boarder bum who just happened to raise a girl who loves snowboarding more than he does.René Hansen, a Norwegian who oversees Burton’s team of pros and who has worked with White since he was not much bigger than Lexi (and “would sometimes cry when he crashed”), told me that he has “never seen a girl at that stage be that good. . . . Right now, if she continues on her path, she will be the best women’s snowboarder who has ever lived.” You could dismiss that as marketing hype, but at this point there’s not much for Burton to market. Lexi is a long way from being famous enough to move product. And Hansen is one of the industry’s most esteemed talent evaluators. When, at a party, I ran into a representative of Target, a company that invests heavily in action sports and is based in the Rolands’ hometown, I asked him if they were thinking about Lexi. He sort of dismissed her as too small-time, but in a way that suggested he wasn’t yet paying attention. When I mentioned what Hansen had said, he perked up. “Really? René said that?”At the moment, Lexi faces two obstacles. One is physics. At a little over four feet tall and 55 pounds, she just doesn’t have the mass to generate enough speed to get big air, or what snowboarders call amplitude. The other is her skill: it’s not just that she’s too good for her age group; she’s also too good for almost every age group below the “open” class (though her rapid improvement has Shawn reconsidering her competitive options). “There are very few girls 12 to 13 who are even close to her,” he says. They might do 180’s, or occasionally 360’s. Lexi, he says, is already “spinning 5’s” — referring to a 540, or making one and a half rotations — and is comfortable “riding switch,” with her weaker leg forward, a requisite of top riding that typically takes years to master. Young boarders also tend to hold their bodies too erect and raise their arms up in the air for balance. Lexi just looks relaxed, like someone who has been at it for a decade. Nick Hamilton, the director of photography at Transworld Snowboarding, a major industry magazine, has seen just about every pro perform. He recently ran into Lexi in California. On the day’s first run — normally a mellow one, he says — “she was hitting rails and bombing down the mountain full speed, riding switch.”On the rare occasions when Lexi does compete, she tends to win. Last winter she entered two regional competitions in the open class — against riders as old as 25 — and won them both. How does this make her competition feel? “Some of them say, ‘Oh, you’re so good! I’m jealous!’ ” Lexi says, giggling.“The limits for Lexi are the superpipe and jump lines,” Shawn says, referring to the fact that she’s still too light to get amplitude. The nearest superpipe is two and a half hours north of Minneapolis, in Duluth. “I joke with my wife that all I need is a bigger piece of property. I’ll blow my own superpipe.”“Superpipe? Superpipe!” she yells, and thrusts her arms in the air like a referee signaling touchdown.LEXI IS STANDING AROUND IN THE parking lot of South Lake Tahoe’s Block Hotel one morning wearing a hot pink snowsuit. Her hand is hidden in a pocket, as if she’s about to produce a rabbit. “You know how much money I found just in one day at Hyland?” she asks, in lieu of “hello.” She pulls out a handful of change and puts it in my palm. “I might buy some Pokémon toys for Ethan,” she says. She begins to apply Skittles lip balm to her lips in the way that Van Gogh applied paint. “You can count it.”Today’s plan is to film some jumps in the backcountry to supplement what Shawn considers an excess of “urban” footage. We pile into the rental car and make a stop for critical supplies like bubble gum and blueberry bagels at Lira’s Supermarket, which a bronze plaque notes was once a Pony Express stop known as Yank’s Station.“Why do they call it Pony Express and not Horse Express?” Lexi asks. “And what is the difference between a pony and a horse, anyway? I think it would be tiring to ride a horse that far.”One of Lexi’s favorite verbal devices is the rhetorical question, and a second party is not necessarily essential to her ability to carry on a conversation. Her preferred transition is “And you know what?” and her monologues tend to come out of left field: “If I could buy three things other than candy, I would buy mango, kiwi and cucumber. Or, if I could buy five things, I would buy mango, kiwi, cucumber, broccoli and milk.”In the car, she shares a story: “Once I saw this spider as big as a quarter. I was scared of it, so I got Mom. My uncle said it could be a barn spider, but how could a barn spider be in Minnesota?”We find suitable backcountry at Meiss Meadow, a local hike-in area just west of Carson Pass, famous for its role in facilitating the passage of gold prospectors to and from California. Most of the snow has melted, but enough lingers on the north-facing slopes for a snowboarder to pick a line between the trees and ride to the bottom without scraping dirt.“I think that we should limit ourselves to 15 minutes of hiking,” Anthony Cupaiuolo says, as the group sets off up the hill. “We gotta keep in mind she’s 8.”Sure enough, approximately five minutes later, Lexi announces, “This is the most I’ve ever hiked. We don’t have these kinds of hills back home.”“Well, this is a real backcountry experience,” Cupaiuolo says. “You’re hiking at 8,600 feet.”She looks at him, cocking her head like a dog sizing up an unfamiliar object. “I don’t understand what you mean.”It is one of those moments when you realize just how young this person is, possessing talents that have far outgrown her mind. In the 8-year-old’s universe, the concept of altitude does not yet exist.Then again, Lexi can surprise you. During a lull the day prior, she was killing time, building a small castle in the snow while Shawn and the crew set up a shot. She sighed — sometimes, it takes dads so long to build jumps. “We should make a movie and call it ‘Snow Bored,’ ” she said, and collapsed dramatically onto her back.LEXI HAS A FEW NICKNAMES, some of which have begun to stick.“That’s dumb! It’s a princess name! Get that out of there!” she howls.“I think that’s a compliment,” he tells her. “It’s after Shaun White.”The group has reassembled at a junkyard just outside the boundary of Heavenly ski resort. At the base of a hill, we set up a ramp and a large corrugated pipe, creating a long and precarious-looking rail that’s taller than Lexi. Two older riders are along for today’s shoot. One is a 23-year-old South African named Kat Maponyane, whom Lexi immediately decides to call Pussycat — and if you had wondered if there’s anything more unusual than snowboarding with an 8-year-old, it would be snowboarding with an 8-year-old and a South African. The other rider is Chase Harriman, a 22-year-old beanpole of a local known for his ability to backflip on his board over just about anything.The three take turns sliding along the corrugated rail. Lexi is battling physics again; she’s having trouble getting enough speed to make it across the pipe. She advances a little further with each run before tumbling off the end. She then collects herself and trudges back up the hill. When she gets tired, Shawn carries her. (“I stay in shape so I can do that,” he says.)At the top, she rests alongside the two older riders.“You gotta go faster, no matter how scared you get, O.K.?” Harriman says. “Promise?”“I’m gonna push you, just like you push us,” he says.“Well, not push you push you. Encourage you.”Lexi considers this for a moment. “So, when you hit this, you have no fear?” she asks.“I just don’t think about it. I visualize it. If I visualize falling, I’ll fall. So I don’t. Can you do it?”“Why wouldn’t I be? It’s over my head!”Lexi yells, “Three, two, one — attack!” and then rides switch onto the pipe, sliding to the end and throwing in a 180 on the landing, every bit as smooth as Harriman.“That’s what her movie should be called,” Harriman says. “Three, two, one — ATTACK!”As the group celebrates her success at the bottom of the hill, Dan Moses turns the camera back to Lexi.“Root beer,” she says. “Root beer gives me energy.”Harriman does yet another backflip, this one over a pile of wood chips, and Lexi cheers. She and Shawn are already discussing when she might begin to integrate flips into her repertory. “We were thinking about it this year, maybe,” Shawn says. “But she’s not quite ready.” They’ve been working on the backyard trampoline to sharpen her spatial perception. “That’s the most important thing,” he says, “her awareness, so she’s spotting the landing at all times.” (During a trip to Whistler in British Columbia shortly after her 9th birthday, in June, she would clear 40 feet or more off of jumps and make a breakthrough on the superpipe. As a reward, Shawn would capitulate to her longtime desire to dye her hair purple.)What do you want to be, in the end? I ask her. What’s your goal?“Good enough so that I can beat Shaun White at the Olympics,” she says. “And I wanna do a 9” — a 900, or two and a half rotations — “when I’m 9.“Pretty soon I think I’ll be all over,” she continues. “Like everyone knows Shaun White, they’ll know me.”'"
"'08-11-02,'0','“It was amazing how much was right there and sort of felt like I had just been there with it, even though it’s been three-plus years,” she said. “When something has such detail and also is so fragmented, the pieces become very distinct and memorable and have very strong impressions. The moods, the flavor of the music, the difference from one fragment to another is so striking, and that makes it all a little more distinctive an experience.”The reason so much time passed between the first performances of “Kafka Fragments” and its return, Ms. Upshaw said, had largely to do with Mr. Sellars’s busy schedule. “There are so many elements, and it was very important to Peter that wherever we take it, he be familiar enough with the people and the theater to know that it was going to work,” she added. After the New York performances, the production will travel to Los Angeles and Berkeley, Calif.Still, for Mr. Sellars the revival feels timely in light of the economic crisis. “Kafka wrote these pieces in that strange Weimar twilight, this impossibly high standard of living with absolutely nothing underneath,” Mr. Sellars said by telephone from Los Angeles. “We’re living right now in this bizarre double world, in which half of us have lost our life’s savings and meanwhile the opulence continues. The particular temperature of America at this moment truly returns us to the meaning of the term ‘Kafkaesque.’ ”Nor is that the only reason Mr. Sellars looks forward to dipping back into a ritualistic production he laughingly calls “a gigantic concerto for detergent and human being.” Two years ago, Ms. Upshaw was found to have early-stage breast cancer. She immediately put her engagements on hold to begin treatment, and successfully completed chemotherapy early last year.“After what Dawn’s been through these past couple of years, she comes to this with even more incredible life force and conviction,” Mr. Sellars said. “Those small miracles of one more day on this earth bloom in her mind now in a very new way.”Ms. Upshaw takes a less beatific view. “I think at first I wanted to have this epiphany, and have this be the most beautiful, life-changing experience or something,” she said. “And you know, it’s just not,” she added with a resounding laugh. “It is what it is, a disease that needs to be treated. And it does make me look differently at some of the choices in my life, how I want to live my life. So in that way, it’s been interesting and great and rotten and all of the above.”Ms. Upshaw has hardly been idle since her first dip back into Mr. Kurtag’s music in August. For a Los Angeles Philharmonic gala in early October, she sang works by Stravinsky and John Adams. The next day she was back in New York alongside the composer Osvaldo Golijov, one of her closest artistic collaborators of late, in a series of workshops for young singers and composers, jointly presented by Carnegie Hall’s Weill Music Institute and the Bard College Conservatory of Music, where Ms. Upshaw is the artistic director of the vocal program.Those workshops are among the offerings that make Ms. Upshaw’s work at Bard a source of pride. Her vocal program brings in eight students per class for a two-year curriculum that includes far more than voice lessons. “I want the program to spark their imagination,” she said, “and I want them to learn about themselves as they are receiving good training.”Students are exposed to a steady stream of new music, including the work of singers of other backgrounds and in other genres. “I’m a huge Bjork fan, so I want to make sure that they’ve heard Bjork sing,” Ms. Upshaw said. Self-sufficiency is also part of the curriculum: students don’t just plan recital programs but also book their own halls and publicize their own events. “It’s not something I was ever taught,” Ms. Upshaw said, “but it’s something I wish I had known.”Ms. Upshaw continues to break new ground for herself as well. With the St. Paul Chamber Orchestra, where she is an artistic partner and helps to plan programming, she presented the premiere of “Carlos Drummond de Andrade Stories” by the jazz composer Maria Schneider in late October. Ms. Schneider, a classically trained Minnesota native whose big-band work has earned two Grammy awards, was initially reluctant to take on her first orchestral composition under conditions that would attract so much scrutiny.“I was thinking, ‘She’s hearing potential here, and I have no idea what it is,’ ” Ms. Schneider said by telephone from St. Paul the day after the premiere, which earned glowing reviews. “She had more faith in me than I had in myself with this thing. I thought it was really amazing that she’d put her trust in that, because as a singer, that’s a vulnerable position to be in. Even more than for an instrumentalist, when you’re a singer, you’re becoming the piece somehow. You don’t want to give that to just anybody.”Another new work, “Treny,” is on Ms. Upshaw’s program at Zankel Hall on Sunday. Commissioned for her by the Terezin Chamber Music Foundation, it is based on verse by the 16th-century Polish poet Jan Kochanowski. Michael Ward-Bergeman, the composer and “hyper-accordion” player, is among the expanding circle of collaborators Ms. Upshaw has met through Mr. Golijov.Beyond “Kafka Fragments,” Ms. Upshaw shows no signs of slowing down. She will sing in Mr. Golijov’s “Ainadamar” at Carnegie Hall in December, then head to Los Angeles for “La Passion de Simone” in January. An Australian tour is in the offing, as are European performances with Christina Courtin, a distinctive New York singer and songwriter, and the Knights, a young chamber orchestra from Brooklyn.If anything binds all those myriad stylistic strands and activities together, it is simply that Ms. Upshaw is choosing them all herself. She claims to want a simpler life, if not necessarily a slower one.“It’s fascinating to work with someone like Peter, who is thinking very much in terms of what he can bring to the world,” she said. “I hope someday I will travel toward that kind of ideology. But for now, I feel I’m doing the world — or my audience — the most good by bringing things to them that I either feel have an important message or bring perspective or beauty to their lives, and do it as honestly as I can. That’s the goal at the moment.”'"

"'08-11-03,'0','Microsoft executives said they were pleased with the progress made since the company was shaken by a series of destructive programs that spread rapidly around the world over the Internet beginning in 2003. But they said that unless software development practices change throughout the industry, any improvements in the security of Windows would be meaningless.“This story is real,” said George Stathakopoulos, general manager for Microsoft’s Security Engineering and Communications group, referring to the improvement in the company’s engineering practices. “Now we have a third-party problem and it’s something we have to go solve.”Security researchers said they were sympathetic to Microsoft’s plight.“The only thing that Microsoft can patch is their own software,” said Patrik Runald, chief security adviser for F-Secure, a computer security firm in Finland. “That’s not what the bad guys are using to get into computers these days. It’s certainly a challenge.”Microsoft and the computer industry have also been unable to solve the so-called dancing pony problem. That refers to the propensity of many computer users to click on enticing links in their e-mail or to visit seductive but malicious Web sites, leaving them vulnerable to Trojan horse downloads and other infections.Over the last three years the computer security industry has been fighting a losing battle, as the ability of computer criminals to profit from identity theft and a variety of other scams has led to the development of a robust underground industry generating viruses and other so-called malware.Microsoft has tried to combat the problem by building a variety of safeguards into its operating systems and its Internet Explorer browser, with mixed success. The User Account Control feature of Windows Vista, which popped up an endless stream of warnings that irritated users, proved to be one of the key factors in the poor reception for Vista. Last week in Los Angeles, the company said it had entirely reworked the user interface of its new Windows 7 operating system to minimize user frustration.In comparing Web browser vulnerabilities in Windows XP and Windows Vista in the first half of the year, the new report found that while Microsoft could be blamed for half of the top 10 vulnerabilities in Windows XP, the top 10 browser vulnerabilities under Vista all came from third-party add-on software from companies like Apple and RealNetworks.A companion report published by Jeffrey R. Jones, a Microsoft security director, claims that Microsoft is fixing security-related bugs about three times as fast as three of its rivals: Apple, Ubuntu and Red Hat.An Apple spokesman, Bill Evans, said Microsoft had previously issued similar reports and declined to comment beyond saying that the data was not supported by users’ experience of infections.Microsoft has a unique vantage point from which to monitor the world of malware and other threats because it receives automated data both from free software it has given to users, like the Malicious Software Removal Tool, and from specialized Internet reporting systems that monitor threats. It also receives data about crashes on more than a half-billion personal computers.The current report indicates that malware infection rates are generally higher in developing countries and regions than in developed ones. Infection rates range from 1.8 for every 1,000 computers in Japan to above 76.4 for every 1,000 in Afghanistan. The United States had an infection rate of 11.2 infected computers for every 1,000 scanned, an increase of 25.5 percent in the last six months.'"
"'08-11-03,'0','Devils goaltender Martin Brodeur will miss at least one game with a bruised elbow, ending a career-high 51 consecutive regular-season starts. The team said Brodeur would not start Monday against the Buffalo Sabres after being injured Saturday in a 6-1 victory against Atlanta. He was set to have an X-ray and a magnetic resonance imaging test Sunday.Brodeur’s streak began Jan. 8 of last season. Goalie Jeff Frazee, the Devils’ second draft choice in 2005, has been called up from Trenton of the ECHL under emergency conditions to serve as the backup to Kevin Weekes.Brodeur, a four-time Vezina Trophy winner, made five saves before leaving Saturday’s game 6 minutes 38 seconds into the second period. He was relieved by Weekes, who posted 14 stops as Brodeur picked up career win No. 544. He needs seven victories to tie Patrick Roy’s career mark of 551.Sharks 5, Avalanche 3 Devin Setoguchi and Milan Michalek each scored two goals, goaltender Evgeni Nabokov had 33 saves and visiting San Jose claimed its fourth consecutive victory.The Pacific Division-leading Sharks improved their conference-best mark to 10-2, including a 4-2 record on the road. Colorado lost its third in a row after winning the previous five.'"
"'08-11-03,'0','“We’re working the Northeast,” he said, referring to a largely white part of the city. “We’ve got values voters up there, Catholics. My people up there say they can carry four to six wards this year, and four years ago, they carried none.”While wealthier whites in Philadelphia, especially in Center City, overwhelmingly support Mr. Obama, some urban blue-collar Democrats — like their counterparts in western and northeastern Pennsylvania — never made the transition from Mrs. Clinton. In South Philadelphia, McCain signs have cropped up in the windows of the low brick houses and on the postage-stamp front yards.“Hillary won some of those white wards by 10 to 1,” said Shanin Specter, son of Senator Arlen Specter, Republican of Pennsylvania, and a lawyer who is steeped in local politics. “Obama is likely to significantly underperform Kerry and Gore in those white row-house wards.”The state Republican Party has begun running advertisements highlighting Mr. Obama’s ties to the Rev. Jeremiah A. Wright Jr., his former pastor, which could tap into concerns among white voters.The Obama campaign is fully aware of the challenge.“This is a tough ward,” said Paul Rossi, 61, a data processor who lives in the neighborhood and is helping out at an Obama office that opened Saturday not far from Marconi Park. “It’s a matter of convincing people culturally that they won’t be harmed by Obama.”It is no accident that Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr., Mr. Obama’s running mate, is being dispatched to speak in Marconi Park on Monday night for his final rally of the campaign. The white, blue-collar Catholics here are just the kind of voters whom Mr. Biden, also Catholic, was chosen to help win over. Mr. Biden is to be joined by members of the Philadelphia Phillies, who just won the World Series.Susan Streicher, 59, a retired secretary and registered Democrat, acknowledged that Mr. Biden’s Catholicism was appealing to her but said she preferred Mr. McCain and Gov. Sarah Palin, Mr. McCain’s running mate, because they oppose abortion rights. Her husband, John, 63, a postal worker, dismissed Mr. McCain, saying that he was a “warmonger” and that Alaska, Ms. Palin’s home state, “is all wilderness.” Both said they thought Mr. Obama would win.Several other people interviewed who said they preferred Mr. McCain declined to give their names.There is no doubt that Mr. Obama, who won Philadelphia in the primary, will again sweep the city, where about 52 percent of voters are black. But while it is a major part of the statewide puzzle, it is still only a piece.In 2004, Senator John Kerry, the Democrat, won about 80 percent of the vote in Philadelphia, beating President Bush by 412,000 votes here. But Mr. Kerry won the state by only 144,000 votes.Gov. Edward G. Rendell of Pennsylvania said Sunday that although he still expected Mr. Obama to win the state, he was “nervous” and had been on the phone “screaming at Chicago,” meaning the Obama headquarters, to send reinforcements. Mrs. Clinton is due in Pittsburgh on Monday; former President Bill Clinton is to stump for Mr. Obama across the state the same day.Mr. McCain continues to devote his most precious resource, his time, to Pennsylvania. He made three in-person pleas to voters in the eastern part of the state over the weekend and has planned a short rally for Monday at the Pittsburgh airport.Although Mr. McCain has paid scant attention to Philadelphia, Mr. Gleason, the Republican state chairman, said Mr. McCain hoped to do better in the city than Mr. Bush did.“In South Philadelphia,” Mr. Gleason said, “with the battle between the African-Americans and all the other wards, we can keep Obama under a 400,000 margin in Philadelphia.” (He added with a laugh, “I get a big salary to be positive.”)Mr. Rendell agreed that because of the white wards, Mr. Obama might get a smaller percentage of the Philadelphia vote than Mr. Kerry did, perhaps 75 percent instead of Mr. Kerry’s 80 percent. But with additional Democratic registrations, he said, and a bigger turnout, Mr. Obama would exceed Mr. Kerry’s numbers.In addition, Mr. Rendell said, Mr. McCain could not rely on the Republicans’ deepest well in the state, which, until 1992, had been the four suburban counties around Philadelphia. Mr. Rendell and Mr. Gleason agreed that Montgomery County, the most affluent and liberal of the four, would vote for Mr. Obama, and that Bucks and Delaware Counties were also likely to swing for him. The fourth, Chester County, is closely contested.Elsewhere in the state, Mr. McCain needs a big turnout in Central Pennsylvania and is making an incursion into the Scranton area.As part of the Obama campaign’s get-out-the-vote operation, scores of volunteers were hustling in and out of the new branch office here on Sunday.Many were from out of state, including two women from New York who said they had expected to be sent to more rural environs and were surprised when they were sent to Philadelphia.“We thought, oh, it’s an urban area, it’s done,” said Marian Masone, 57, a film curator who lives in Brooklyn.They said they were also surprised by the negative reaction to them in South Philadelphia. Ms. Masone and her friend, Eileen Newman, 62, who works in film management and lives in Manhattan, said that some people said “no way” to them about Mr. Obama and that one told them, “Get off this block.”As for Mr. Klemash, the South Philadelphia resident, he said he was ambivalent about Mr. McCain, too. “McCain is too close to Bush,” he said, yet he admires Mr. McCain’s military service. Then again, he said, Ms. Palin was a bad choice as Mr. McCain’s running mate because she does not have enough experience. But then again, he said, Mr. Obama does not have enough experience, either.His conclusion: “This is a really hard election.”'"
"'08-11-03,'0','His aides say he is relieved that the race is almost over and for the most part out of his hands. He is also buoyed — and obsessed, his staff says — with polls that show the race tightening in some battleground states and allow him hope that he might still have a shot.He is also now in the role that he finds at least familiar, if not comfortable — the scruffy underdog barking at Washington. It was not for nothing that his first stop Thursday was in Defiance, Ohio.“If we were 10 points up, we’d all be a little bit happier,” said Mark Salter, one of Mr. McCain’s closest aides. “But you throw a lot of stuff at the guy, and he fights all the harder.”Mr. Graham and Mr. McCain’s other traveling buddy, Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, independent of Connecticut, are a frequent part of the road show and will fly home with him to Arizona in the small hours of Tuesday morning. Aides say they are essential to improving the candidate’s mood, Mr. Graham in particular. Mr. McCain’s wife, Cindy, who is now constantly at his side, introduces Mr. Graham at each stop as “my husband’s best friend.”“He’s like campaign Prozac,” said Nicolle Wallace, a top adviser to Mr. McCain. “They just sit there and laugh.”Mr. McCain has also been moved these last few days, his aides say, by the panorama of America that has unfolded before him. He has made appearances at high school football fields, town squares and lumberyards, and he held a nostalgic final town hall meeting on Sunday night here in Peterborough, N.H., one of the earliest stops of his first presidential campaign in 2000.On Friday Mr. McCain marveled to aides about the beauty of the rolling Appalachian foothills on Ohio’s border with West Virginia. On Saturday his motorcade sped through a tunnel of gold leaves in Bucks County, Pa.Two hours later, the caravan was navigating Midtown Manhattan so Mr. McCain could open “Saturday Night Live” with Tina Fey.There he good-naturedly mocked his circumstances in a faux QVC segment by saying he could only afford the shopping channel and not a half-hour of prime-time television time for an infomercial like Mr. Obama. “Look, would I rather be on three major networks?” Mr. McCain asked viewers. “Of course. But I’m a true maverick – a Republican without money.”Whatever happens on Tuesday, Mr. McCain’s aides say he is too much a student of history not to be astonished and humbled by his own place in it.As a prisoner of war in Vietnam, Mr. McCain mused to his cellmates about becoming president one day. Now he is amazed that a candidate who was left for politically dead a year ago has managed to “lurch” — his own choice of verb from a recent interview — toward the finish line at all. That is not to say that he is about to ease up on his decade-long pursuit of the White House.“He wants this very badly,” Mr. Graham said.Mr. McCain’s days now begin earlier than they used to, around 6 a.m., for morning interviews that he races through in 5- and 10- minute bites. Afterward the drill is the same as it has been from the start. He and his aides assemble with coffee in his hotel suite, go over the plan for the day, check out the newspapers and, lately, pore over the campaign’s overnight polls.Mr. McCain tracks every move, particularly anything from his own pollster, Bill McInturff. He avidly listens to campaign aides who say that if the unexcitable Mr. McInturff says he is gaining, it must be so. “We do not have a happy-numbers pollster,” Mr. Salter said. “We’ve got Mr. Buzz Killer.”By the middle of the day, Mr. McCain likes to have news of the latest tracking polls. “We all kind of know when Rasmussen comes out, and Zogby,” Ms. Wallace said. “So we all watch for it.”Mr. McCain, in the meantime, is on the phone a half-dozen times each with his campaign manager, Rick Davis, and his top strategist, Steve Schmidt, wanting to know everything they are doing and anything they have heard. “He is an information sponge,” Mr. Salter said.His low point, his aides say, was the suspension of his campaign in September to make his way to Washington to help negotiate a $700 billion bailout of Wall Street, only to have the House Republicans blow the deal up in his face. His slight edge in the polls evaporated, and he was described by friends as mad at himself, his campaign and the world.Two and a half weeks later he was devastated, aides said, when Representative John Lewis, a Georgia Democrat and civil rights leader, invoked the segregationist George Wallace to rebuke Mr. McCain for tolerating insults and threats hurled at Mr. Obama at his rallies.Mr. McCain took the edge off some of his rhetoric and has in the last few days loosened up in his speeches, although he still lustily attacks Mr. Obama as the tax-and-spend “redistributionist in chief” who can not be trusted to lead the nation in crisis.But the “get off my lawn” tone of the angry guy across the street has at times become a more neighborly “give me a break.”“He’s measuring the drapes!” Mr. McCain shouted on a chilly Saturday morning at Christopher Newport University in Newport News, Va. The line was a well-worn one from his stump speech about what he calls Mr. Obama’s White House presumptions, but he delivered it laughing, as if he was amusing no one more than himself.During the day he gets almost no exercise, eats the candy and junk food strewn all over his bus, and naps slumped in his seat in the curtained-off front section of his plane. The national reporters he once called his “base” remain banished in the back; aides say he is convinced that they are all rooting for Mr. Obama.There would in any case be little time for the rolling seminars he once conducted on the bus. He has local reporters aboard for short hops, but he and Mrs. McCain spend far more time entertaining a shifting cast of Republican governors and members of Congress. Last week on the campaign plane, the group included Gov. Charlie Crist and Senator Mel Martinez of Florida.Mr. Martinez came through the curtain long enough to spin about what might have been. If Lehman Brothers and the insurance giant A.I.G. had not foundered, he said, “we would still be up seven.”In the evenings, Mr. Graham and Mr. McCain’s top campaign advisers — almost all are now traveling with him — walk the candidate to his hotel room, where they go over the plan for the next day and then leave him alone. Mr. McCain turns on ESPN and relaxes after rallies that blast out “Life Is a Highway” and other campaign anthems.“It’s like being in a rock band,” Mr. Graham said. “You do your gig, and you’ve got to wind down a little bit.”Mr. McCain takes an Ambien if he needs one, but in these last days there is scant sleep on the schedule. He planned to end Sunday with a three-hour flight from New Hampshire to a post-midnight rally in Miami, then rest briefly and head to the airport for an 8 a.m. departure for Tampa.From there he was to embark on a seven-state, 18-hour odyssey across America: north to Tennessee, northeast to Pennsylvania, then west to Indiana, New Mexico, Nevada and finally home to Arizona, where he will hold a midnight rally on the courthouse steps of the old territorial capital of Prescott, the town where he has ended all his Senate campaigns. He was set to arrive at his condominium in Phoenix sometime after 2 a.m. on Election Day.Before Monday’s marathon, Mr. McCain said goodbye to New Hampshire, the state that gave him two primary wins and twice resurrected his candidacy. Polls show Mr. Obama with a double-digit lead for the state’s four electoral votes, and it was an odd place to devote five hours just a day and a half before the election.But Mr. McCain loves the state. In Peterborough’s 90-year-old town hall, he jettisoned his stump speech to answer questions on politically dangerous topics that he has avoided for months. He even had praise for Mr. Obama. “I admire and respect my opponent,” he said.It was a message tailored to his audience of independent-minded voters, but it was also a display of the old John McCain, or perhaps the new one of the last few days.“I come to the people of New Hampshire — Republicans, independents, Democrats, libertarians, vegetarians,” Mr. McCain said quietly, to laughter, “and ask again to let me go on one more mission.”'"
"'08-11-03,'0','SEATTLE (AP) — Workers at Boeing began returning to work on Sunday after members of the machinists union voted to end a costly eight-week strike that clipped profits and stalled deliveries by the company, the world’s second-largest commercial airplane maker.Employees were going back to work at Boeing’s commercial airplane factories, which have been closed since the Sept. 6 walkout. The strike cost an estimated $100 million a day in deferred revenue and production delays on the company’s highly anticipated next-generation passenger jet.Members of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers ended their walkout on Saturday by ratifying a new contract with Boeing. Members of the union, which represents about 27,000 workers at plants in Washington State, Oregon and Kansas, voted about 74 percent in favor of the proposal five days after the two sides tentatively agreed to the deal and union leaders recommended its approval.“This contract gives the workers at Boeing an opportunity to share in the extraordinary success this company has achieved over the past several years,” Mark Blondin, the union’s aerospace coordinator and chief negotiator, said in a statement.“It also recognizes the need to act with foresight to protect the next generation of aerospace jobs. These members helped make Boeing the company it is today, and they have every right to be a part of its future,” he said.'"
"'08-11-03,'0','Mr. Trimble, 41, works at the edge of the exchange’s main floor, shoulder to shoulder with six other men in a booth the size of an elevator car. Not everyone graduated from college, but all are resident scholars of the hurly-burly floor, educated in reading markets, hunting for matches and executing buy-and-sell orders. They are worth their commissions, they say, because they provide things a computer cannot, things like experience, intuition — a “feel.”Crammed into this booth with no place to sit are Mike Ackerman, Paul Davis, Billy Johnson and Nick Stratakis, of B and B Securities; Mr. Trimble and Chris Martin, of Greywolf Equity Partners; and Ralph Roiland, a clerk. Scrappy independents, all; no one works for Goldman Sachs.Still, when they step onto Broad and Exchange Streets to breathe the autumn air, they sometimes get blamed for the world’s economic crisis. “You walk out there and people think you’re what’s wrong with this country,” says Mr. Martin, father of three, of Morristown, N.J.With the opening of the market imminent, the men in the booth send instant messages to clients, asking, hoping, for interest in trading stock. But the volatile activity in recent weeks has unnerved many investors; some respond with noncommittal “Thanks” and “I’m away from my desk.”At 9:30 on the dime the opening bell rings, clanging off the century-old walls of white marble, the ornate ceiling of gold. Brokers rush to the center of the floor, where specialists in individual stocks track the last best data. Shouts of “Buy off 10,000, pair off 10,000,” and “How’s Marathon?” feed the low roar of business.After a while, though, quiet returns. Brokers study computer screens in their booths, some to monitor stocks, some to play virtual games. In one corner, a man is deciphering a crossword puzzle, while three beside him play cards. The stock exchange has a different rhythm now, its denizens say, because of technological advances and the shrinking of the once-dominant house firms. It’s not like before.Many of the men, and it’s still almost all men, remember the days when they stood several deep around the specialists, nudging, pushing, staying put for several straight hours, shouting “Squad!” for pages to hustle handwritten notes to clerks on the wings, jockeying at the banks of phones now hanging from hooks like relics.Those were the days when black humor and practical jokes helped to blow off steam and show affection for comrades. The one-liners would fly minutes after, say, the space shuttle Challenger went down. A trader would return to work, disfigured, after a serious car accident to find at his station a toy car, burned and crushed. And he would laugh.Billy Johnson, 48, a burly former firefighter from Oceanport, N.J., recalls how his floor colleagues helped him to toast his approaching marriage: by ripping his jacket and covering him with shaving cream, perfume and potato chips.The jokes and put-downs still go on, and lately someone has been beeping a horn concealed in his jacket. But the humor is not quite as black.“A lot of that stopped after 9/11,” says Doreen Mogavero, 53, an experienced floor broker who points out that ground zero is a couple of blocks away. “It wasn’t that funny anymore.”Gone too is the loud physicality. Headsets and hand-held computerized pads mean less running around, fewer clerks, softer voices, a smaller chance for error. Those technological advances have opened the market to just about anyone with a computer, making floor trading seem almost quaint. Many traders retired rather than change their ways; others were laid off, including one now walking through the exchange. Selling insurance, someone says.Of the 1,366 broker’s licenses available for an annual fee of $40,000, only 553 are being used. In 2006 there were 3,534 people working on the floor; today there are 1,273.“The stress now is the lack of business,” says Benedict Willis III, 48, a senior broker who started here in 1982. Moments later he is interrupted by applause. It is the sound of a lost job: a floor broker of 20 years has just been laid off from a major firm, and now his colleagues are showing their respect.“They’re clapping him off,” Mr. Willis says. “It’s the second one this week.”One of the brokers in that small booth, Mike Ackerman, leads a Scandinavian delegation on a brief tour of the exchange, past computer screens flashing red and green, past taped-up photographs of family members, closed baseball stadiums and the Lower Manhattan skyline when it was intact. As he takes them to the balcony, a delegate asks a question in halting English: Does Mr. Ackerman feel personally responsible for the collapsing economy?Good question, answers Mr. Ackerman, 39, father of three, from Basking Ridge, N.J. Good question. But — no.He and all the people down on that floor are executing trades on behalf of others, using a hybrid method that combines a computer’s technology with a human’s gut instinct. They do not deal in subprime mortgages; they do not get golden parachutes. But hey: Good question.These brokers make money whether the market goes up or down; their earnings depend on the volume of trades, and the floor averages 117 million orders received a day. Still, they prefer north to south. “It’s political economics,” Mr. Willis explains. “We want to reassure investors that it’s O.K. to come back.”Tomorrow the market will plummet in the very last minutes. Beaten brokers will repair to bars like Bobby Van’s across the street, where the bartenders know their drinks before they’ve ordered.But right now the market climbs with every tick toward the 4 p.m. closing, as though willed to rise by all the Lennys now eyeing the electronic board. Up, up, up.“Two minutes to go,” someone says at 3:58. “A lifetime.”'"
"'08-11-03,'0','But in creating those alliances, the mayor may have hurt his chances for re-election. A large part of Mr. Bloomberg’s popularity rests on his image as a nonpartisan billionaire not beholden to special interests or fellow elected leaders.After the bruising term limits battle, however, many are wondering what kind of offers — and compromises — the Bloomberg administration may have made. Several members of the Council who opposed revising term limits have openly accused the administration of strong-arming their colleagues, without naming the lawmakers.Mr. Lopez’s role underscores those concerns. Mr. Bloomberg has long railed against partisan, machine politics. But his aides appear to have worked, at times, closely with Mr. Lopez, a state assemblyman, during the term limits fight, despite his ties to a Democratic Party organization long criticized for cronyism.On Oct. 22, the day before the Council voted to amend the term limits law, the mayor’s top political operative, Kevin Sheekey, set up a meeting at City Hall with Mr. Lopez and Vincent Gentile, a Brooklyn councilman who was leaning against extending term limits.During the meeting, Mr. Sheekey explained that if Mr. Gentile voted to allow Mr. Bloomberg to seek a third term, the mayor would most likely support the councilman’s tough re-election race in a swing district of Brooklyn, according to two people briefed on the meeting.The mayor, Mr. Sheekey told both men, “would be present with you in the district,” according to these people.When asked about the meeting, Stu Loeser, a spokesman for the mayor, said that “we made our case on the merits.” Mr. Sheekey, a deputy mayor, declined comment.Mr. Gentile ultimately voted against the term limits legislation, arguing that the law should be changed by a voter referendum, the same method by which it was created. “The administration did not allay my concerns,” he said in an interview.But the apparent offer of political support by a deputy mayor in exchange for a vote strikes many as the kind of back-room political deal-making that Mr. Bloomberg would denounce, said Douglas A. Muzzio, a professor of public affairs at Baruch College.It was not, however, the only one during the term limits fight. To win the support of a potential critic, the cosmetics heir Ronald S. Lauder, Mr. Bloomberg promised to appoint him to a charter revision commission in 2010. Mr. Lauder bankrolled the successful 1993 campaign to create term limits in New York City and had vowed to fight the mayor’s campaign to revise the law.Mr. Muzzio said the mayor “used carrots and sticks to build a coalition,” even though such tactics may be at odds with the mayor’s reputation. “The myth of Bloomberg as the nonpartisan philosopher king is belied by the fact that they played political hardball here,” he said.Many council members who voted with the mayor needed no incentive; the revision will also allow them to seek a third term next year.Aides to Mr. Bloomberg said that the mayor and his deputies always reach out to allies and foes to build support for legislation, and did so appropriately in the case of the term limits bill.Many of those who rallied behind the term limits legislation, the aides said, did so without any prompting, because they want the option of re-electing a mayor with a proven track record and a sterling résumé from the financial world at a time when the city faces an economic crisis.Mr. Rattner, who helps manage the mayor’s fortune, and the developer Jerry I. Speyer, who called council members and urged them to extend term limits, had prodded the mayor to remain in office long before Mr. Bloomberg decided to challenge the term limits law.“I think it’s hard to not give him credit for having run a good administration,” said Stephen Berger, a founder of Odyssey Investment Partners, a private equity firm, who signed a public letter endorsing the term limits extension. “He is the most sophisticated and the most skilled person available.”Mr. Lopez, the Brooklyn Democratic leader, said that his support stemmed from longstanding opposition to term limits and a belief that members of the Council should change the law, rather than just voters. “I don’t believe in a referendum form of government,” he said.And the Bloomberg administration says that it was not alone in blurring traditional political boundaries. A major opponent of the term limits change, the Working Families Party, reached out to unions that are closely linked to the Democratic Party, like the large health care workers union, 1199 S.E.I.U.The Working Families Party also contacted Democratic leaders, like Representative Anthony D. Weiner and Comptroller William C. Thompson, who both opposed the term limits legislation and plan to run against him in the 2009 mayoral race. Mr. Thompson organized members of the clergy to speak out against Mr. Bloomberg’s legislation, just as the rabbi at Mr. Bloomberg’s synagogue, Congregation Emanu-el, advocated for it. The rabbi, David M. Posner, did not return calls and e-mail messages during the last week.Mr. Lopez said he would not recognize some supporters of Mr. Bloomberg’s legislation, especially those in the business world. In the past, he clashed with many of those executives on issues like congestion pricing, which he opposed. “If I saw them, I would not know who they are,” he said.'"
"'08-11-03,'0','The answer probably can’t be calculated precisely, but any gains have to be set against three sorts of harm.First, a distressingly large portion of activity in the financial world is little more than gambling. When shares and bonds, or derivatives based on them, are bought and sold, the gains and losses almost cancel each other out. Such trading may be fun — portfolio management is a common hobby — but it does almost nothing for the nonfinancial economy.As in organized gambling, the losses in financial trading are actually a bit greater than the gains because the house takes its share. In recent years, the financial house — brokers, exchanges, fund managers — has augmented its gains by playing from the inside. Until the crisis came along, such trading often paid off handsomely.The second problem is not with the financiers but with the financial economy itself. Finance works primarily with credit rather than cash, and credit has been expanding greatly. The ratio of debt outstanding to gross domestic product in the United States has increased from 161 percent in 1974 to 354 percent in mid-2008. Half of that growth has been within the financial sector itself — from 17 percent to 114 percent of G.D.P.Loans are promises to pay, which are much easier to make than to keep. The more credit-laden the economy, the greater the potential damage from broken promises. To see how a trickle of credit losses can turn into a cascade, just look around.Finally, there is a psychological, even a moral, problem with finance. A country gets rich by making stuff, not by seeming to make money from money. But when people see huge financial profits — on Wall Street or just from owning a house — they tend to want more of them. The economically illusory gains of finance distract people from more valuable tasks.So will the United States, and the world, decide that it has had too much of this not particularly good thing? Not necessarily, since a four-decade trend has the momentum of a speeding train. But the current hurricane of financial destruction might just be strong enough to derail it.A durable reversal of finance’s fortunes would be tough on Wall Street, the City of London and all whose livelihoods depend on keeping the industry running. But less finance need not cause any broader economic damage.There’s more than money involved. For at least a generation, finance has been taken up as a career by a disproportionately large proportion of the world’s most talented people. If more of the best and the brightest were to take up careers in industry, education or the arts, everyone would be better off. EDWARD HADAS'"
"'08-11-03,'0','NASHVILLE (AP) — Rob Bironas kicked a 41-yard field goal with 9 minutes 36 seconds to go in overtime to keep the Tennessee Titans perfect with a 19-16 victory against the Green Bay Packers on Sunday.Bironas had a chance to win the game in regulation, but he banged a 47-yarder off the upright.“I was hoping for exactly what happened,” Bironas said. “We’d win the toss and get another shot at it. I don’t miss many, so I definitely wanted another shot at it to put us in the lead and go home with the victory, 8-0.”The Titans (8-0) won the toss before overtime, then drove 55 yards in 10 plays to give Bironas his second chance. On third-and-2, Bironas made his fourth field goal of the day and started a celebration as the Titans matched a franchise record by winning their 11th straight regular-season game.“When you win eight games, you’re going to on occasion need to win some like this, and that is just what we did,” Titans Coach Jeff Fisher said. “We hung in there.”The Packers (4-4) tied the game, 16-16, with 5:30 left on Mason Crosby’s third field goal, a 38-yarder. After the Titans went three and out, Aaron Rodgers drove Green Bay to the Tennessee 45, but the Titans forced the Packers to punt with 1:49 left. The Packers, who outgained the Titans by 390-347 in total offense, never got the ball back.'"
"'08-11-03,'0','SHANGHAI — Chinese regulators said over the weekend that they had confiscated and destroyed more than 3,600 tons of animal feed tainted with melamine, an industrial chemical that has contaminated food supplies in China and led to global recalls of Chinese dairy products.In what appeared to be China’s biggest food safety crackdown in years, the government also said Saturday that it had closed 238 feed makers in a series of nationwide sweeps that involved more than 369,000 government inspectors.The aggressive moves come amid growing worries that the animal feed industry could be contaminated by melamine, endangering the national food supply and posing a health threat to consumers.In the past week and a half, eggs produced in three provinces were found to be tainted with high levels of melamine. And in September, melamine-tainted infant formula was blamed for sickening more than 50,000 children and causing at least four deaths.Regulators in the southern province of Guangdong, which has about 80 million people and is a major manufacturing center near Hong Kong, said they had discovered six tons of melamine-tainted animal feed.'"
"'08-11-03,'0','“We probably will need more resources,” Dominique Strauss-Kahn, the fund’s managing director, said last week. “There is no way the fund can solve the problem on its own.”Mr. Brown’s call came on the type of weekend that has become common as the credit crisis intensified, with governments scrambling to bolster growth and back up troubled institutions.On Monday, the South Korean government unveiled a 14 trillion won ($10.8 billion) stimulus plan aimed at preventing a recession.In Berlin, Chancellor Angela Merkel’s government was working on an economic stimulus plan for Germany that media reports said would be valued at about $64 billion. In a podcast, Mrs. Merkel said the cabinet would approve the measures on Wednesday.She also called on banks to make use of a larger fund the government has made available for troubled lenders.In Lisbon, the authorities said they were setting up a credit line for Portugal’s banks and were moving to nationalize one of the smaller lenders in the country, Banco Português de Negócios.In Russia, where the benchmark Micex stock index has fallen nearly 60 percent this year, officials announced new measures to halt capital flight. Igor Shuvalov, a first deputy prime minister, told state television on Sunday that the government would limit the sale of rubles by banks that receive government aid.That came a day after the Russian Finance Ministry said it had injected more than $6 billion from a government fund into Vnesheconombank, a state-run bank, which will use the money to provide loans to banks and to buy stocks and bonds.In Beijing, the Chinese prime minister, Wen Jiabao, warned that the economic crisis was raising the risk of social unrest, and he called for more focus on domestic spending, the China News Service reported.Mr. Wen said the government’s need to promote growth was beginning to override its mandate to keep inflation in check. The monetary authorities in Beijing cut interest rates on Wednesday for the third time in two months.In Mumbai, the Reserve Bank of India, the central bank, said Saturday that it would “employ both conventional and unconventional measures” to respond to the crisis, and cut its benchmark interest rate a half-point.'"

"'08-11-04,'1','I've always believed that America offers opportunities to all who have the industry and will to seize it. Senator Obama believes that, too. But we both recognize that though we have come a long way from the old injustices that once stained our nation's reputation and denied some Americans the full blessings of American citizenship, the memory of them still had the power to wound.A century ago, President Theodore Roosevelt's invitation of Booker T. Washington to visit -- to dine at the White House was taken as an outrage in many quarters. America today is a world away from the cruel and prideful bigotry of that time. There is no better evidence of this than the election of an African American to the presidency of the United States. Let there be no reason now -- (cheers, applause) -- let there be no reason now for any American to fail to cherish their citizenship in this, the greatest nation on Earth. (Cheers, applause.)Senator Obama has achieved a great thing for himself and for his country. I applaud him for it, and offer in my sincere sympathy that his beloved grandmother did not live to see this day, though our faith assures us she is at rest in the presence of her creator and so very proud of the good man she helped raise.Senator Obama and I have had and argued our differences, and he has prevailed. No doubt many of those differences remain. These are difficult times for our country, and I pledge to him tonight to do all in my power to help him lead us through the many challenges we face.I urge all Americans -- (applause) -- I urge all Americans who supported me to join me in not just congratulating him, but offering our next president our good will and earnest effort to find ways to come together, to find the necessary compromises, to bridge our differences, and help restore our prosperity, defend our security in a dangerous world, and leave our children and grandchildren a stronger, better country than we inherited.Whatever our differences, we are fellow Americans. And please believe me when I say no association has ever meant more to me than that. (Cheers, applause.)It is natural -- it's natural tonight to feel some disappointment, but tomorrow we must move beyond it and work together to get our country moving again. We fought -- we fought as hard as we could.And though we fell short, the failure is mine, not yours.SEN. MCCAIN: I am so deeply grateful to all of you for the great honor of your support and for all you have done for me. I wish the outcome had been different, my friends. The road was a difficult one from the outset. But your support and friendship never wavered. I cannot adequately express how deeply indebted I am to you.I am especially grateful to my wife, Cindy, my children, my dear mother -- (cheers, applause) -- my dear mother and all my family and to the many old and dear friends who have stood by my side through the many ups and downs of this long campaign. I have always been a fortunate man, and never more so for the love and encouragement you have given me.You know, campaigns are often harder on a candidate's family than on the candidate, and that's been true in this campaign. All I can offer in compensation is my love and gratitude, and the promise of more peaceful years ahead. (Laughter.)I am also -- I am also, of course, very thankful to Governor Sarah Palin, one of the best campaigners I have ever seen. (Cheers, applause.) One of the best campaigners I have ever seen --MR. MCCAIN: -- and an impressive new voice in our party for reform and the principles that have always been our greatest strength. (Cheers, applause.) Her husband Todd and their five beautiful children -- (cheers, applause) -- with their tireless dedication to our cause, and the courage and grace they showed in the rough-and- tumble of a presidential campaign. We can all look forward with great interest to her future service to Alaska, the Republican Party and our country. (Cheers, applause.)To all my campaign comrades, from Rick Davis and Steve Schmidt and Mark Salter, to every last volunteer who fought so hard and valiantly month after month in what at times seemed to be the most challenged campaign in modern times, thank you so much. A lost election will never mean more to me than the privilege of your faith and friendship.I don't know -- I don't know what more we could have done to try to win this election. I'll leave that to others to determine. Every candidate makes mistakes, and I'm sure I made my share of them. But I won't spend a moment of the future regretting what might have been.This campaign was and will remain the great honor of my life. And my heart is filled with nothing but gratitude for the experience and to the American people for giving me a fair hearing before deciding that Senator Obama and my old friend Senator Joe Biden should have the honor of leading us for the next four years.I would not -- I would not be an -- an American worthy of the name, should I regret a fate that has allowed me the extraordinary privilege of serving this country for a half a century. Today, I was a candidate for the highest office in the country I love so much. And tonight, I remain her servant. That is blessing enough for anyone and I thank the people of Arizona for it. (Cheers, applause.)SEN. MCCAIN: Tonight -- tonight, more than any night, I hold in my heart nothing but love for this country and for all its citizens, whether they supported me or Senator Obama -- whether they supported me or Senator Obama, I wish Godspeed to the man who was my former opponent and will be my president.And I call on all Americans, as I have often in this campaign, to not despair of our present difficulties but to believe always in the promise and greatness of America, because nothing is inevitable here.Americans never quit. We never surrender. (Cheers, applause.) We never hide from history, we make history. (Cheers, applause.)Thank you, and God bless you, and God bless America. (Cheers, applause.) Thank you all very much. (Cheers, applause.)'"

"'08-11-04,'1','On Monday, however, he did precisely that. As expected, he signed legislation that he had birthed and hustled through the City Council to give him and other officials a shot at a third term next November. Thus was the expressed will of the people declared null and void.Before he reached for his pen, the Great Nullifier listened to scores of New Yorkers who went to City Hall to bear witness. Most times, few people show up for bill-signing ceremonies. But emotions over term limits and the subversion of the two referendums have run high. The City Hall rotunda was filled with New Yorkers who waited hours in some cases to give the mayor a piece of their mind.Some praised him. Some denounced him. Some did both, applauding his performance as mayor but condemning this attempt at what they called “a power grab.” All arguments had pretty much been heard many times before.Certainly, the Great Nullifier advanced no new ideas. As in the past, he said that his grasp at a third term had nothing to do with the clock that is running out on his second term, but had everything to do with the financial crisis that, to his mind, requires continuity in leadership.“Crisis has a way of forcing us to put pragmatism first,” he said. He applauded the Council’s 29-to-22 vote extending term limits as “choosing substance over process and pragmatism over ideology.”Ignored was the fact that the process he referred to dismissively is known to most people as the democratic process. As for ideology, a Quinnipiac University poll shows that 9 out of 10 New Yorkers want any change in the term limits law to come through a new referendum, not legislation. That’s not ideology. That’s the people speaking with crystal clarity.If you want self-interest, consider that 29-to-22 Council vote. Of the 51 lawmakers, 35 would have been forced out of office at the end of next year. Nearly two-thirds of them, 23 of 35, voted to reward themselves with a possible extra term. Of those who do not have a 2009 expiration date, 63 percent — 10 of 16 members — voted against the change. Funny how that worked.Of course, to hear lawmakers talk on Monday, self-interest had nothing to do with it. It was all about government continuity during a crisis. Times are so hard, you see, that New York cannot survive without the foresight, the high-mindedness and the command of municipal finances that this batch of council members provides. Besides, if New Yorkers feel differently, they can always vote them all out of office next November.“This is democracy at its best,” said Councilman Kendall Stewart of Brooklyn.That’s how the borough presidents saw it as well — four of the five who showed up, anyway. “We need all the experience we can count on to get us through this crisis,” said Helen M. Marshall, who represents Queens.Got it. Without these borough presidents hanging on beyond next year, New York might not make it.Hardly everyone accepted that premise. Many speakers cautioned Mr. Bloomberg that nothing less than the public’s faith in government and his own legacy were on the line. Among them was Councilwoman Letitia James of Brooklyn, a leading opponent of extending term limits.“With a stroke of the pen, Mr. Mayor, you will pre-empt democracy,” she said in a voice tinged with sadness.Soon enough, the Great Nullifier picked up his pen and used it.'"
"'08-11-04,'1','HOUSTON — A judge in Houston heard arguments Monday on the legality of the defamation case brought by Roger Clemens against his former trainer, Brian McNamee. At issue is whether McNamee was immune from such actions, and, if he was not, whether the case should be tried in Texas.U.S. District Court Judge Keith Ellison, who has been considering these points for several months, called the hearing to discuss with the lawyers their motions for and against dismissing the case. The judge said he was “agonizing over these claims” and realized the repercussions of his decision would be felt beyond his courtroom.McNamee’s lawyer, Richard Emery, argued that under terms of an immunity agreement, his client was compelled by the Department of Justice and the Federal Bureau of Investigation to disclose to former Senator George J. Mitchell that he had injected Clemens with performance-enhancing drugs.“F.B.I. agents requested that he meet with Mitchell and tell him the same things he had told them,” Emery said. “He did that under clear threat of further proceedings against him.”Mitchell was commissioned by Major League Baseball to investigate the use of performance-enhancing substances in the sport. He released a widely distributed report last December in which Clemens was identified, along with numerous other current and former players, as having used steroids and human growth hormone, a charge Clemens denies.'"
"'08-11-04,'1','Most of the works that did sell went for prices far below their estimates, which were set in the summer before the financial crisis. Sotheby’s spent the past few weeks persuading consigners to lower their expectations. On those works that the auction house had given a guarantee — an undisclosed sum promised to a seller regardless of a sale’s outcome — it was clear that Sotheby’s was prepared to sell something and lose money rather than risk having to flog it later.Market jitters have been the talk of the art world for a while now, but aside from dealers’ grumbling about how bad business has become, there had been few concrete indications until last week. That’s when a 1909 Picasso that was estimated at more than $30 million was abruptly withdrawn from Monday’s auction. The sellers, heirs of the Surrealist painter Enrico Donati, who died in April, said they were pulling the work “for private reasons,” but others said it was because of fears that the painting would be seen later as secondhand goods if it failed to sell.In rosier times, the painting would have been snapped up by one of the newly rich from the former Soviet Union, Asia or the Middle East who have been fueling the market in the last few years. But as the wealth of these collectors has diminished, the appetite for paying millions of dollars for art has seemed to diminish as well. Sotheby’s said the buyers on Monday were predominantly Americans, although it was clear that Russians also took home several works.Many in the audience were watching to see what new levels would be set. “People were nervous,” said Susan Seidel, a Manhattan dealer, after the sale. “The mood seemed very tentative.”A Degas gouache, “Dancer in Repose,” that was being sold by the financier Henry Kravis and his wife, Marie-Josée Kravis, was sought by two telephone bidders. From around 1879, it depicts a dancer sitting on a bench massaging her foot. The Kravises bought the work at Sotheby’s in London in 1999 for $27.9 million, and in the summer the auction house gave the Kravises a guarantee that experts said was more than $40 million. On Monday Yasuaki Ishizaka, head of Sotheby’s Tokyo, took the winning bid by phone: $33 million, or $37 million including Sotheby’s fees.One of the evening’s brightest moments came when “Vampire,” an 1894 Munch canvas of a man locked in a tortured embrace, arrived on the block. Four bidders tried for the painting, and it brought $34 million ($38.1 million with Sotheby’s commission).The evening did see some big casualties. “Seated Man (Leaning on a Cane),” a 1918 painting by Modigliani that the Nahmad family, dealers with galleries in New York and London, bought at Christie’s in London in 1996 for $3.2 million, was estimated at $18 million to $25 million. There wasn’t a bid in sight, and Tobias Meyer, the evening’s auctioneer, gave up trying to sell the work.The Nahmads weren’t the only disappointed dealers offering works last night. Another was William Acquavella, a Manhattan dealer who purchased Giacometti’s “Diego’s Head,” a 1958 painting, at Christie’s just three years ago for $1.1 million. On Monday, it was estimated to bring $6 million to $8 million. But again, not a hand went in the air. Sotheby’s had given Mr. Acquavella a guarantee that was said to be about $6 million, making it an expensive mistake for the auction house.A year ago, a group of paintings by the Russian artist Boris Dmitrievich Grigoriev being sold by the Berkshire Museum in Pittsfield, Mass., would have been snapped up. But on Monday the results were mixed. Among the best was “Pipe Players,” a 1924 painting that depicts a pair of peasant musicians.One telephone bidder wanted the painting, and it sold for $2.8 million ($3.2 million including Sotheby’s commission), well under its $4 million to $6 million estimate. But “Shepherd of the Hills,” another Grigoriev, this one from 1920, brought $3.2 million ($3.7 million with commission). It was the only work fetching more than its high estimate, in this case $3.5 million.'"
"'08-11-04,'1','Their last-minute efforts were amplified by their muscular ground organizations and unprecedented advertising barrages in all forms. The Obama campaign tested its text-messaging program to remind voters, particularly young ones, to go to the polls. The McCain campaign activated its automated phone system to check with any voter who had shown an interest in the Republican ticket.In their pitches to voters, each candidate struck an optimistic chord, delivering a few gracious words about his opponent and offering a vow to change Washington. Yet neither refrained from reprising the piercing criticisms that have become the soundtrack for the five-month general election fight.“At the end of this long race, I want to congratulate him on the tough race that he has fought,” Mr. Obama said of Mr. McCain in a morning speech here at Veterans Memorial Auditorium. “He can point to a few items where he has broken with President Bush, but when it comes from the central issue of this election, the plain truth is John McCain has stood with George Bush.”Mr. McCain delivered a truncated version of his stump speech at each stop but grew hoarser as the day progressed. His aides said he appeared to be catching the bad cold that had waylaid many others in the petri dish of his campaign plane. By late afternoon in Indiana, he was sucking on throat lozenges to try to finish the marathon.“My friends, you know that I’ve been fighting for this country since I was 17 years old, and I have the scars to prove it,” he said at a rally in Indianapolis as he battled to prevent Mr. Obama from taking a state that has not backed a Democratic presidential candidate since 1964.Four hours later, Mr. McCain dropped out of the sky into the supposed home of space aliens, Roswell, N.M. “I am pleased to announce that I have received the alien endorsement,” he told the crowd, to a roar of laughter.As the contest headed to its finish, an air of normalcy surrounded Mr. Obama. There was no rush of friends or advisers on the plane for the final flights. His demeanor, at least from his public appearances, seemed the same as it has for months. His schedule of rallies was no different than at any point in the general election.Only a few close advisers knew that at 8 a.m. he had received word from his sister that his 86-year-old grandmother, Madelyn Dunham, had died. When he arrived at a rally, he spoke briefly about his grandmother, whom he visited last month in Honolulu.“She has gone home,” Mr. Obama said, his voice tinged with emotion. “She died peacefully in her sleep with my sister at her side, so there’s great joy instead of tears.”Mr. McCain, as he sprinted through seven states, warned voters at every stop of the differences between the outlooks and policies of the two tickets. He did not dally, spending 30 minutes at each stop, with his argument boiled down to fit the frenzied moment.“Senator Obama’s running to punish the successful,” Mr. McCain said at his opening stop in Tampa, Fla. “I’m running to make everyone successful.”The mood on the McCain campaign plane was upbeat and punchy throughout the day as Mr. McCain’s advisers continued to hammer their belief that the polls were tightening and that Mr. McCain’s chances of winning the presidency were difficult but not impossible.“Winning 270 is right in the cards,” Rick Davis, the campaign manager, insisted around midnight Sunday, as Mr. McCain’s plane headed from New Hampshire to Florida.Mr. McCain drew stirring applause from his crowds — as well as jeers directed at the Democratic rival — when he said Mr. Obama wanted to “spread the wealth around,” Adding,“He’s in the far left lane of American politics.”The barnstorming rallies, the dawn-to-dusk television commercials and the armies of volunteers flooding neighborhoods disguised how the United States now elects its president: with millions of ballots already having been cast in early voting.In Ohio, voting lines looped in and out of doors, upstairs and around corners at the registrar’s office in Columbus, with a record number of voters adding their ballots to those that have been collected for nearly a month. Democrats outnumbered Republicans by more than two to one.In Florida, about 37 percent of registered voters have already cast ballots, state officials said, setting the stage for potentially record-breaking turnout.In Virginia, where more restrictions are placed on early voting, the state has processed 465,962 absentee ballots. And more than 300,000 Virginians voted in person by an absentee ballot. In 2004, a total of 222,059 absentee ballots were cast.Worried about the outlook in Virginia, where a Democrat has not won the presidential race in more than four decades, Mr. McCain’s campaign sued the state’s election board on Monday. The campaign asserted that the absentee ballots had not been mailed on time to members of the military serving overseas.Mr. Obama held his final rally in Virginia, a sign Democrats were waging an all-out push for the state, which is seen as a barometer for the fight with Mr. McCain. In Virginia and around the country, both sides are keeping a close eye on the weather .“I think if it rained mud, it won’t make a difference,” said L. Douglas Wilder, the former governor of Virginia, who was the state’s first black chief executive. “They’re coming out. Trust me, they’re coming out.”The First Results Are InDIXVILLE NOTCH, N.H. (AP) — Mr. Obama easily won early Tuesday in Dixville Notch, N.H., where tradition of having the first Election Day ballots tallied lives on. Mr. Obama defeated Mr. McCain 15 to 6.'"
"'08-11-04,'1','Mr. Monegan has said he believes he was fired because he would not bend to pressure from Ms. Palin; her husband, Todd; and her subordinates to fire Trooper Wooten, who had been through a bitter divorce with the governor’s sister. He said that he had received many complaints about Mr. Wooten from the Palins and several members of the administration and that he felt they wanted him to dismiss Mr. Wooten, who is still on the force.Mr. Petumenos said the governor and other state employees had testified firmly that several conversations Mr. Monegan described had not happened. No witnesses confirmed Mr. Monegan’s account of the discussions, he said.“Unless someone can be proved to abuse their power,” Mr. Petumenos added, “it seems to me they haven’t done it.”Mr. Monegan said Monday in an interview: “The conversations absolutely did take place. I’ve been a police officer for some 35 years. Aren’t I supposed to tell the truth? And in this case I did, under oath to both investigators.”“It’s not only me,” Mr. Monegan said. “There were senior members of the Department of Public Safety who got the calls, felt the pressure and knew exactly what was going on. I will always feel that there were conversations and e-mails that were intended to inappropriately use an official government position to settle a family matter.”He added, “Obviously I’m disappointed with the outcome and the contradictory nature of this investigation, compared to the first one.”The governor of Alaska appoints the members of the Alaska Personnel Board, though all three of the board’s current members were appointed by Ms. Palin’s predecessor. Ms. Palin reappointed one member to a new term, said a spokesman for the governor, Bill McAllister.“This is obviously the correct outcome,” Mr. McAllister said. “We knew all along that Governor Palin did not abuse her power.”John Cyr, the executive director of the Alaska Public Safety Employees Association, said it was not surprising that a board appointed by the governor’s office would reach the conclusion.“We all knew that the governor’s office was putting pressure on” the Department of Public Safety “to take action against Michael Wooten,” Mr. Cyr said.In late July, several weeks after Mr. Monegan was fired, the state’s bipartisan Legislative Council ordered an inquiry into his dismissal. The controversy undercut Ms. Palin’s image as a reformer, but it did not become prominent nationally until late August, when she was chosen as the running mate for Senator John McCain, the Republican presidential nominee.Ms. Palin had said earlier in the summer that she would cooperate with the legislative inquiry but after she was nominated she refused to testify. The McCain-Palin campaign said the inquiry had become politically driven and sent lawyers and staff members to Alaska to help with the governor’s legal strategy and to hold “Palin truth squad” news conferences almost daily.In September, Ms. Palin took the unusual step of filing an ethics complaint against herself to the Personnel Board, which she said was the proper forum for dealing with the matter. The board’s report said it was based on “substantially more evidence” than the legislative inquiry, including a three-hour deposition from Ms. Palin.Mr. Petumenos said the legislative inquiry had determined that Ms. Palin violated the scope of state ethics laws by “inaction,” because she supposedly did not stop her staff and her husband from pressuring Mr. Monegan. But Mr. Petumenos said the legislative inquiry had not met requirements for finding a violation because it did not cite violations under specific sections of the ethics code.In the legislative report, the investigator, Stephen E. Branchflower, a former prosecutor in Anchorage, said Ms. Palin had herself applied pressure to get Trooper Wooten dismissed and also let her husband and subordinates press for his firing. The report concluded that she had violated the Alaska Executive Branch Ethics Act.State Senator Kim Elton, a Democrat who is the chairman of the Legislative Council, said of the Personnel Board’s findings: “I’m surprised. I think the ethics act is very clear and that Mr. Branchflower strung together a series of events that made it clear there was not only smoke but fire.”'"

The sale in Harare was one in a series of ivory auctions being held for the first time in a decade. Last year, the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species ruled that Botswana, Namibia, South Africa and Zimbabwe could sell 108 tons of stockpiled ivory to approved Japanese and Chinese buyers.

"'08-11-04,'1','Re “Loans? Did We Say We’d Do Loans?” (editorial, Oct. 29):See, I thought the “bailout money” would be earmarked for whatever the government thought would do some good. So, for example, if buying up troubled banks was the point, then the money should have been directly tied to those purchases, as in you buy X bank and we will put public money into the deal. If the money was for making loans, then I thought they would create a fund from which such loans would be made or backed up by government guarantees.Investing money into banks that retain full discretion as to what they would do with it doesn’t seem right. Then, again, I believed them when they said they would find weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. Bruce NeumanSag Harbor N.Y., Oct.29, 2008'"
"'08-11-04,'1','“Maybe in the past, there was a desire to keep the election separate and not turn ‘Monday Night’ political,” said Norby Williamson, an executive vice president of ESPN, which is in its first presidential election cycle with “Monday Night.”Two members of ABC Sports’ former “Monday Night” team said that in their time it would have been the place of ABC News to do presidential interviews.“ABC News obviously would have had first dibs on presidential politics,” said Fred Gaudelli, the former producer, who now produces NBC’s “Sunday Night Football” games. Al Michaels, who called ABC’s games from 1986 to 2005 before heading to NBC, said, “ABC News had election eve specials, and I’m sure they would have wanted to ride herd on something like this.”Williamson said that ABC News was supportive of ESPN’s monthslong pursuit of the Obama and McCain interviews and offered to promote them on “World News Tonight.”McCain and Obama were not in the ESPN booth, unlike the celebrities the network paraded in front of viewers in 2006 and 2007 before realizing that the game was more important than Christian Slater. Instead, Chris Berman, working from ESPN’s studios in Bristol, Conn., interviewed Obama first Monday afternoon, from Jacksonville, Fla.Berman spoke next with McCain, who was in Indianapolis.The order that they ran, at about 10:10 p.m. Eastern, was determined during a coin flip by Kordell Stewart, the former Steeler who is an ESPN analyst.“He said, ‘Heads, Obama; tails, McCain,’ “ Williamson said. It came up heads.The interviews were cut into three-minute segments separated by a 30-second commercial. Berman did not give either man a Bermanian nickname, so there was no need to worry about its presidential respectability.ESPN, of course, promoted the interviews thusly: “Obama! McCain! Boomer!” Imagine a 1960 equivalent, CBS-style: “Kennedy! Nixon! Uncle Walter!”McCain played ESPN’s game, using a Berman phrase to answer the question about what he wanted people to think about him as they voted.“He. Could. Go. All. The. Way to the White House,” McCain said, moving Berman to abandon the sober demeanor he had adopted.Both candidates talked about high school coaches, one who taught Obama that “this isn’t about you, it’s about the team,” and one who guided McCain to appreciate literature and to “do the honorable thing even when nobody’s looking.”Obama said he advocated a college football playoff (he told Gray, jokingly, that it would be “one of my legislative priorities”); McCain wants to take “significant action” against performance-enhancing drugs.This was not Obama’s first appearance on “Monday Night.” He was the star of its opening segment two years ago before a Chicago Bears-St. Louis Rams game, when he was still teasing the public about a run for the White House. He spoke somberly to the camera about critical questions facing America, as if ready to announce his candidacy. “I am ready,” he said, putting a Bears cap on his head, “for the Bears to go all the way, baby.” Then he loudly hummed the first four notes of the “Monday Night” theme.Only one man who has become president, Ronald Reagan, visited the “Monday Night” booth. Reagan was the governor of California in 1973 when he was spotted in the back of ABC’s booth talking football fundamentals to John Lennon, an incongruous sight to any sensate human aware of the men’s politics. Grasping the moment, Howard Cosell told Frank Gifford to talk to Reagan, and, “I’ll take the Beatle.”'"
"'08-11-04,'1','Indeed, the conservatives did rate the traditional golf and marriage jokes as significantly funnier than the liberals did. But they also gave higher ratings to the absurdist “Deep Thoughts.” In fact, they enjoyed all kinds of humor more.“I was surprised,” said Dan Ariely, a psychologist at Duke University, who collaborated on the study with Elisabeth Malin, a student at Mount Holyoke College. “Conservatives are supposed to be more rigid and less sophisticated, but they liked even the more complex humor.”Do conservatives have more fun? Should liberals start describing themselves as humor-challenged? To investigate these questions, we need to delve into the science of humor (not a funny enterprise), starting with two basic kinds of humor identified in the 1980s by Willibald Ruch, a psychologist who now teaches at the University of Zurich.The first category is incongruity-resolution humor, or INC-RES in humor jargon. It covers traditional jokes and cartoons in which the incongruity of the punch line (the husband who misses his wife’s funeral) can be resolved by other information (he’s playing golf). You can clearly get the joke, and it often reinforces stereotypes (the golf-obsessed husband).Dr. Ruch and other researchers reported that this humor, with its orderly structure and reinforcement of stereotypes, appealed most to conservatives who shunned ambiguity and complicated new ideas, and who were more repressed and conformist than liberals.The second category, nonsense humor, covers many “Far Side” cartoons, Monty Python sketches and “Deep Thoughts.” The punch line’s incongruity isn’t neatly resolved — you’re left to enjoy the ambiguity and absurdity of the reindeer effect or Hambone’s affection for dolphins. This humor was reported to appeal to liberals because of their “openness to ideas” and their tendency to “seek new experiences.”But then why didn’t the liberals in the Boston experiment like the nonsense humor of “Deep Thoughts” as much as the conservatives did? One possible explanation is that conservatives’ rigidity mattered less than another aspect of their personality. Rod Martin, the author of “The Psychology of Humor,” said the results of the Boston study might reflect another trait that has been shown to correlate with a taste for jokes: cheerfulness.“Conservatives tend to be happier than liberals in general,” said Dr. Martin, a psychologist at the University of Western Ontario. “A conservative outlook rationalizes social inequality, accepting the world as it is, and making it less of a threat to one’s well-being, whereas a liberal outlook leads to dissatisfaction with the world as it is, and a sense that things need to change before one can be really happy.”Another possible explanation is that conservatives, or at least the ones in Boston, really aren’t the stiffs they’re made out to be by social scientists. When these scientists analyze conservatives, they can sound like Victorians describing headhunters in Borneo. They try to be objective, but it’s an alien culture.The studies hailing liberals’ nonconformity and “openness to ideas” have been done by social scientists working in a culture that’s remarkably homogenous politically. Democrats outnumber Republicans by at least seven to one on social science and humanities faculties, according to studies by Daniel Klein, an economist at George Mason University. If you’re a professor who truly “seeks new experiences,” try going into a faculty club today and passing out McCain-Palin buttons.Could it be that the image of conservatives as humorless, dogmatic neurotics is based more on political bias than sound social science? Philip Tetlock, a psychologist at the University of California, Berkeley, who reviews the evidence of cognitive differences in his 2005 book, “Expert Political Judgment,” said that while there were valid differences, “liberals and conservatives are roughly equally closed-minded in dealing with dissonant real-world evidence.”So perhaps conservatives don’t have a monopoly on humorless dogmatism. Maybe the stereotype of the dour, rigid conservative has more to do with social scientists’ groupthink and wariness of outsiders — which, come to think of it, resembles the herding behavior of certain hoofed animals. Ladies and gentlemen, what we have here is a terrifying example of the reindeer effect.'"
"'08-11-04,'1','BRUSSELS (Bloomberg) — European finance ministers on Monday ruled out a joint stimulus package to revive the region’s economy and vowed instead to coordinate national policies as they try to limit the fallout from a recession on consumers and companies.“We do not believe that in the euro area we need a general revival package, a sort of traditional program designed to stimulate the economy,” Finance Minister Jean-Claude Juncker of Luxembourg said at a news conference after meeting with his European counterparts in Brussels.Finance chiefs of countries using the euro met hours after the European Commission slashed its growth forecasts and predicted that the economy would stagnate next year. While President Nicolas Sarkozy of France has called for a joint package to help the region combat the economic slump, the ministers indicated that they favored a looser system of “coordinated” measures.European Union countries have already begun planning measures to jump-start their own economies, with Germany preparing a two-year program of investments and incentives to provide a $64 billion stimulus. The European monetary affairs commissioner, Joaquín Almunia, said such plans were not at odds with the organization’s approach.“I don’t think adopting measures at the national level is inconsistent with the need to coordinate actions, provided the national decisions are integrated in an adequate framework,” he said at the news conference in Brussels. “What I want to avoid is the negative spillover of some decisions that can create problems for the good functioning of the internal market.”Mr. Sarkozy and Prime Minister Gordon Brown of Britain have called for redrawing global financial rules under a “new Bretton Woods,” referring to the 1944 conference that created the modern global economic system and institutions like the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.'"
"'08-11-04,'1','Even the name of the Web site created for the campaign is combative: dunkinbeatstarbucks.com. Visitors to the site can send friends e-cards bearing statements like “Friends don’t let friends drink Starbucks” and similarly puckish greetings.“All we’re trying to do is a little bit of disruptive marketing,” Ms. Allen said. The campaign promoting the taste test is created by Hill, Holliday, Connors, Cosmopulos in Boston, part of the Interpublic Group of Companies.Other examples of negative product pitches include a long-running campaign from Apple that mercilessly mocks the PC operating systems sold by Microsoft; a campaign from the Fox Business Channel cable network, which derides Jim Cramer of CNBC; ads for Burger King that take on other fast-food chains like McDonald’s and Wendy’s; and a campaign for a new variety of Campbell’s soup, Select Harvest, that berates Progresso for selling soups with ingredients like monosodium glutamate.“We’re pleased with what we’re seeing” since the Select Harvest campaign began, said John Faulkner, a spokesman for the Campbell Soup Company in Camden, N.J. “The early interest from consumers has been terrific.”The campaign, created by BBDO Worldwide in New York, part of the Omnicom Group, includes print ads that show a variety of Progresso chicken noodle soup under the headline “Made with MSG” next to a similar variety of Select Harvest under the headline “Made with TLC.”Some negative ads, like the Select Harvest campaign, generate response ads from the targets in which they defend themselves or even counterattack. The point and counterpoint takes on a tit-for-tat quality reminiscent of a presidential campaign — or a playground fight.“We take our brand equity very seriously,” said Mark Addicks, senior vice president and chief marketing officer at General Mills in Minneapolis, the parent of Progresso, which has replied to the attack ads from Campbell with two sets of ads.One set is focused on how Progresso plans to remove monosodium glutamate from its recipes. The other set describes a taste test between the varieties of Progresso and Select Harvest chicken noodle soups that are featured in the Select Harvest campaign. Progresso, needless to say, comes out ahead this time.Both sets of Progresso ads are created by Saatchi & Saatchi in New York, part of the Publicis Groupe.After more than two years of pounding from Apple, with a campaign that portrays the PC as geeky and the Macintosh as cool, the Microsoft Corporation responded in September with $300 million worth of ads that embrace the Apple phrase “I’m a PC.” The Microsoft riposte, by Crispin Porter & Bogusky in Miami and Boulder, Colo., part of MDC Partners, seeks to turn the Apple negatives into positives.“They’ve made a caricature out of the PC,” said David Webster, general manager for brand marketing at Microsoft in Redmond, Wash. “If they want to have a conversation about the fake PC, we want to have a conversation about the real PC.”“When they start making claims about our products, that’s frustrating,” he added. “But you don’t start advertising campaigns out of frustration.”Campaigns that take such a tack run the risk of being perceived as overly negative, a judgment that can hurt a brand as much as it can a political candidate.A report called the Consumer Pulse Check, released last month by Mullen in Wenham, Mass., another agency owned by Interpublic, found that shoppers “are tired of feeling downbeat” and “want brands that make them feel good.”In other words, brands that attack other brands run the risk of tarnishing their images.“If I define my brand by my competitor’s brand, I had better get out some information about my brand at the same time,” Mr. Melançon at Ito Partnership said, or the campaign can be deemed unfair or pejorative.One way to avoid that is by leavening a negative ad with humor.“It was very much a question of how do you do this without turning people off,” said Tim Cawley, a senior vice president and group creative director at Hill, Holliday who worked on the Dunkin’ Donuts campaign.The answer, he said, was to present a scientist who improbably follows coffee drinkers to their work places to administer the taste test so they “can cram it into their busy day.”Of course, to a marketer being attacked by name by a competitor, ads softened with humor are still no laughing matter.“At this time, given what the country is going through, people are looking for great experiences and good value,” said a spokesman for Starbucks in Seattle, Vivek Varma.“Lots of companies run comparative campaigns, but the effective ones need to be credible and authentic,” he added. “If the data is wrong or your tone is off, or if you are pitching a message out of touch with what consumers generally regard, you may be creating opportunity for your intended competitor.”In other words, an ad from Dunkin’ Donuts that challenges Starbucks in a way consumers consider inappropriate could redound to the benefit of Starbucks.To followers of political advertising — particularly presidential ads in 2008 — that may be a suggestion to wake up and smell the coffee.'"
"'08-11-04,'1','Backed by a strong business lobby, the opposition Conservative Party and the nation’s two biggest tabloid newspapers, small businesses are demanding cheaper credit and tax breaks after a multibillion-pound government bank bailout failed to immediately free up credit.Though small businesses account for more than half of Britain’s gross domestic product and employ more than 13 million, their plea is controversial. They face, arguably, the same problems of higher borrowing costs and declining consumer spending that afflict larger rivals.Some analysts said smaller businesses were more vulnerable to a downturn because they depended more on financing. “A large company has more options to raise money,” said Philip Shaw, chief economist at Investec Securities in London. But others said smaller firms were actually at an advantage because they were more flexible and could adapt better to slowing demand.That may be true, but small businesses say they are feeling the pinch as banks introduce charges for processing overdraft applications, increase their fees for managing accounts or request additional collateral for loans, according to the British Chambers of Commerce.The changes are a result of higher interbank lending rates, a deteriorating economic outlook and the banks’ more conservative attitude toward risk.The British government tried to free up credit by making its bailout of Royal Bank of Scotland, Lloyds TSB and HBOS this month dependent on the banks’ returning to “2007 levels” of lending to small businesses.The chancellor of the Exchequer, Alistair Darling, met with executives of other mayor British banks last week to persuade them to reduce borrowing costs for smaller businesses. Instead of freeing up lending, the entreaties led to criticism by some investors that the government was repeating the mistake it made during the boom: encouraging borrowing.“Businesses are anticipating banks will be supportive, reflecting the support they have received themselves,” Neill Thomas, head of debt advisory at KPMG in London, said. But “the reality for companies is the tap remains blocked. We expect only a trickle of liquidity to return to debt markets in the period through to Christmas.”That would be bad news for many of Britain’s 4.7 million small businesses, and it would infuriate those that helped turn small businesses from net borrowers to net depositors over the last 17 years. Smaller companies now keep £1.48 billion with their banks, making them one of the biggest group of depositors.One of them is William N. Mullings, who runs a small jewelry store in London founded by his family in 1798. He is upset that the government bailed out the banks, which are now still reluctant to lend. “If you are running a business, any business, you should be able to do so without the help of the government,” Mr. Mullings said.Higher borrowing costs are not the only problem for smaller businesses. They also struggle as customers increasingly fall behind with payments, sometimes up to several months. Late payments can be a matter of life and death for smaller businesses.The issue has started to threaten the Labor Party’s traditionally cozy relationship with small business and has moved small businesses into the center of a lively political debate about economic competence between Britain’s two major parties.The government is keen to be seen as a supporter of small businesses because they are perceived as “struggling, small and hard-working,” said Robert A. Blackburn, professor of small-business studies at Kingston University in London. “There are a lot of votes in small businesses and there is a realization that this is quite a powerful group of people,” said Mr. Blackburn.It is also widely believed that it will be small businesses that will lead Britain out of recession. “People running Britain’s small businesses are the lifeblood of our economy,” the government’s secretary for business, Peter Mandelson, said.The popularity of Prime Minister Gordon Brown has already taken a hit because many voters blame him for creating the borrowing-and-spending boom during his time as chancellor of the Exchequer that is now pushing the economy into recession.The government pledged to pay its own bills to smaller businesses in no more than 10 days but David Cameron, the leader of the opposition Conservative Party, called for more drastic steps. In a letter to The Sun newspaper, Mr. Cameron suggested that small businesses be allowed to delay their value-added tax payments to the authorities, and be given a cut in some tax rates, to help them cope with “the economic downturn made in Britain and designed by Gordon Brown.”Demands by the Federation of Small Businesses went even further, including a £1 billion rescue fund for small businesses backed by the European Investment Bank, and a policy of publicly naming customers who pay late.At his cleaning shop in the south of England, Mr. Banwell seemed to take a pragmatic approach: “I have no problem with having to tighten the belt and don’t think banks should be forced to lend more — they are businesses too — but the belt-tightening needs to be evenly spread.”'"
"'08-11-04,'1','Other officials said it was premature to condemn the program, given that the first capital injections were made only last week. The Treasury’s overriding goal, they said, is to stabilize the nation’s financial system after its worst crisis since the 1930s.Among the problems, critics say, is that despite earlier promises of transparency, the process is shrouded in secrecy, its precise goals opaque. Treasury officials have refused to disclose their criteria for deciding which banks are healthy enough to get money — and which are too sick.And officials have yet to say they even have a broader strategy, though banking executives are convinced the government wants to encourage acquisitions of sick banks by healthy ones.Industry sources said that banks, after filing a two-page application, are assigned a ranking from 1 to 5 — with 1 or 2 essentially guaranteeing that they are eligible, and 5 insuring they are not — by their regulator. The five officials then make what can be a life-or-death decision, with a thumbs-down generally interpreted to mean that a bank was not healthy enough to survive on its own.The work is complex, far-reaching and telescoped into an impossibly tight timetable. And it is being done against the backdrop of a change of power in Washington, which will throw many of these people out of their jobs on Inauguration Day.“There is a real urgency to deploy this money quickly and effectively,” said James H. Lambright, who took a leave three weeks ago as the president of the Export-Import Bank of the United States to become the interim chief investment officer of the rescue effort.A trim, self-confident former investment banker, Mr. Lambright, 38, is the chairman of a committee of relatively young officials — all are in their 30s or 40s — with backgrounds in law, banking or regulation. None of them could have expected this kind of responsibility; Mr. Lambright himself was a last-minute substitute after a previous appointee was kept in his old job.On Friday evening, Mr. Lambright was lugging a six-inch-thick pile of folders — plus a pair of BlackBerrys and a cellphone — as he prepared for a Sunday afternoon meeting of the committee to select the next banks to receive capital infusions.With more than $80 billion left to spend, and hundreds of banks in line for it, the days, nights and weekends of the overworked, sleep-deprived Treasury staff members are a blur of meetings and conference calls, and constant pressure.“This is a four-ring circus,” said Tim Ryan, a former director of the Office of Thrift Supervision, who helped run the savings and loan cleanup in the 1980s and 1990s.Already, critics from Capitol Hill to Wall Street are lashing out at the program, saying the banks are misusing the capital infusions by hoarding the money rather than lending it, as the Treasury Secretary, Henry M. Paulson Jr., urged in order to unclog the credit markets.The government, the critics say, is wrongly steering funds to banks to take over weaker rivals. The rescue program prodded one such merger last week, when Treasury agreed to inject $7.7 billion into PNC Financial Services and rejected an application for cash from the National City Corporation, an ailing bank in Cleveland. The two announced a merger the same day that PNC was approved.“Where we are headed is credit allocation by the federal government,” said William Poole, a former president of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. “It really reminds me of the morass we got into with wage-price controls in the 1970s.”Critics also say that, by not barring banks from paying dividends or hefty bonuses, the Treasury is leading taxpayers to think their money is being spent frivolously.All this comes after Mr. Paulson abruptly shifted the focus of the program to injecting capital rather than buying distressed mortgage-related assets from the banks. This meant that Congress had never debated the details of how the government ought to carry out a recapitalization.The absence of that debate comes with a price. Treasury officials have been pressured by industry lobbyists to stretch the program to include insurance companies, transit agencies and even automakers.Indeed, the helter-skelter nature of the program is drawing so much criticism that even some of the bailout bill’s biggest proponents on Capitol Hill are complaining that its legitimacy is being thrown into question. “What the Treasury doesn’t understand is the anger in the country about this,” said Barney Frank of Massachusetts, the chairman of the House Financial Services Committee.Mr. Frank, who has scheduled oversight hearings later in November, warned that he might try to block the Treasury from getting the second $350 billion approved by Congress.Inside the Treasury — where officials shuttle between each other’s offices on the building’s southwest corner, facing the White House and the Washington monument — the view, not surprisingly, is different.They say the critics have not offered solutions about how to compel banks to lend money. The Treasury has to walk a fine line, officials add, since using brute force could lead to the banks making more bad loans, which is how they got into this mess.Treasury officials acknowledge their actions might speed a shakeout in the industry, even if that is not the main motivation.“The primary goal is not consolidation; the primary goal is to strengthen the system,” said Michele A. Davis, the chief spokeswoman. “If consolidation strengthens the system, it’s a positive.”Bank executives say that increased lending depends on attracting more capital from private investors. To do that, it may be essential for a bank to strengthen its market position by making acquisitions. Suspending dividends could send investors running for the exits.Besides, they add, the bailout law only allows the government to stop banks from increasing dividends, not banning them outright.The committee — which also includes Neel Kashkari, interim head of the rescue program, and two other senior Treasury officials, Anthony Ryan and Phillip L. Swagel — acts on a recommendation from the primary regulator of the financial institution. That could be the Federal Reserve, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Comptroller of the Currency, or the Office of Thrift Supervision.What happens next, when the application and recommendation go to the Treasury, is largely a mystery. The criteria by which the Treasury decides which banks get money and which do not are secret.Mr. Nason said the process had to be confidential so that rejected banks did not suffer damage in the markets. Even to disclose the selection criteria could quickly destabilize banks perceived to have the wrong profile, he said.The committee members study financial statements and sometimes kick back applications to the regulators for more information. They also analyze the market in which a bank operates, looking for the mix of strong and weak banks. As the number of applications increases, Mr. Lambright said he was recruiting a team of banking analysts to help with the process.“When we move from a dozen banks to hundreds of banks, we’ll need a system,” Mr. Lambright said.He said his work at the Export-Import Bank, where he selected American exporters to receive trade financing, was good preparation for this job, even if he will hand out more money in a few weeks at the Treasury than his bank’s entire $60 billion credit portfolio.Though Treasury officials are loath to require banks to lend, they do seem to be jawboning. “They must meet their responsibility to lend, and support the American people and the U.S. economy,” Mr. Ryan told a securities industry conference last week.Mr. Frank said they should do more by requiring banks to show a dollar-for-dollar relationship between the government funds and increased lending.“If they lend out all the money they got from the government,” he said, “they can do whatever they want with the rest. If they don’t feel this is going to encourage lending, then don’t take the money.”It is the regulators, more than the Treasury Department, who are doing the coaxing by suggesting, for example, that a desired merger by a bank would be more likely to win approval if a bank participated in the capital injection program, industry executives said.The Treasury’s approach has its defenders, among them a former senior Treasury official, Edwin M. Truman, who said he believed the people running the bailout were technocrats trying to shore up the system, not ideologues.Donald V. Hammond, a longtime Treasury official who is the interim chief compliance officer of the program, said that, in any event, Congress had put in place layers of oversight. Mr. Hammond began his government career working on the bailout of the Chrysler Corporation.“This is more intense,” he said.'"
"'08-11-04,'1','Mr. Braulio and his wife, recently married, have put off talk of having children for now and to save money they are eating meals and watching movies at home rather than going out.Zaragoza’s fate echoes the pattern now unfolding across Spain and the rest of Europe.On Monday, the European Commission said the 15-nation euro zone appeared to have entered a recession in the third quarter, and predicted the economy would barely recover next year, growing by just 0.1 percent.In Madrid, the government announced an economic stimulus program after a report Friday that Spain’s gross domestic product fell 0.2 percent last summer, the nation’s first quarterly economic contraction in 15 years.Despite highly publicized interest rate cuts and more than a trillion euros in loan guarantees and capital injections by governments from London to Frankfurt, the situation is expected to only get worse. European consumer confidence plunged in October, hitting its lowest point in 15 years.“It’s come very suddenly,” said José Mendizábal, chief executive of Pikolin, Spain’s biggest mattress maker and one of the largest private employers in this area. “People are frightened of spending money.”Pikolin has already eliminated temporary positions, bringing its work force down to 1,200 from 1,400. But the slowdown has intensified in recent weeks, with sales now off 15 percent from a year earlier, and more job cuts are likely if sales do not improve.Mr. Mendizábal said his customers are a barometer of the broader economy. First-time home buyers are in the market for lots of new furnishings while homeowners with discretionary income buy when they feel flush. Now, he said, the former have nearly disappeared and the latter “are hanging on to their old mattresses.”With consumers pulling back, governments that just finished bailing out the financial system are now looking to help the broader business sector. There is little doubt that both the European Central Bank and the Bank of England will cut rates again this week.In Germany, the Continent’s biggest economy, cabinet approval for a 50 billion euro, or $63.1 billion, plan to help industry and consumers, which includes a tax credit for first-time auto purchases, could come as early as Wednesday. Meanwhile, Nicolas Sarkozy, the French president, has proposed support for job creation and a government fund to protect local companies with beaten-down share prices from “foreign predators.”The pain did not hit home in Zaragoza until General Motors announced just a few weeks ago that it planned to lay off 600 of its 7,000 workers for up to a year and that it would suspend production for at least two weeks to work off inventories.Zaragoza, which at peak capacity is capable of churning out more than 2,000 subcompacts, small minivans and delivery trucks a day, was one of seven G.M. plants in Europe to go on hiatus in October.As recently as this past spring, demand was still so strong that Romuald Rytwinski, the director of the plant, had to rely on overtime to produce enough cars.The overtime disappeared in the summer, but there was little warning that auto sales would plunge so abruptly.Indeed, Europe’s entire auto sector is now suffering, with Daimler cutting its 2008 earnings forecast by 1 billion euros in late October, while Renault and Fiat have also issued profit warnings.“In the past, you could forecast demand for a quarter,” Mr. Rytwinski said. “Then in the summer, for about a month. Now, we’re talking about weeks.”The arrival of G.M. here 26 years ago was the beginning of something of an economic miracle for this region, which had been agricultural traditionally and sparsely populated.Drawn by Zaragoza’s historic location as a crossroads between Spanish cities, as well as Toulouse in France, G.M.’s arrival spurred the opening of additional component manufacturers.The area received another shot in the arm four years ago when Zaragoza was chosen to host the 2008 International Exposition.With roughly 1 billion euros provided by the Spanish government and other sources to build everything from a glistening new bridge designed by Zaha Hadid to sprawling pavilions and new parkland along the Ebro river, the future looked bright even as troubles were growing elsewhere. “People in their 20s and early 30s have never known anything but prosperity,” said Amado Franco, president of Aragón’s biggest savings bank, Ibercaja.At 62, Mr. Franco has watched Zaragoza, along with the rest of Spain, transformed by prosperity. “People have changed,” he said. “In my generation, we said, ‘One city, one wife, one company.’ My children’s generation is quite different.”Ibercaja, with its fairly conservative lending practices, remains one of Spain’s strongest savings banks. But Mr. Franco is surprised at how much attitudes toward debt shifted during the boom.Aragón was “a very hard land, with very hard people,” he said. But in recent years, he said shaking of the head, people even “borrowed to go on holiday. That’s American.”Roque Gistau, the president of the 2008 Expo, now finds himself trying to fill the 1.8 million square feet of office space constructed for the exhibition. He claims about 60 percent has been sold, but confessed it is taking a long time to find buyers for the rest.“In the last three months, sales have come to a complete standstill,” he said. “A year ago, I was sure we’d sell 100 percent.”With the expansion, joblessness in Zaragoza and the surrounding Aragón region fell well below Spain’s traditionally high unemployment rate, which now stands at more than 11 percent.But Alberto Larraz, Aragón’s economic minister, said he expected the local jobless rate to rise from its current 6.2 percent to near 8 percent by the end of the year, with no improvement in 2009.While younger workers like Mr. Braulio say they are pessimistic about the future, older Spaniards like Mr. Gistau say they remain hopeful that it will be only a matter of time before the good days return.Citing an old Spanish proverb, Mr. Gistau said, “There is no evil that lasts for 100 years.”'"

"'08-11-04,'1','To the connoisseur of fine food, chicken may seem depressingly monotonous no matter how it’s prepared. But scientists worry about a more basic degree of sameness — a lack of genetic diversity in the birds that are raised for meat and eggs.An analysis of commercial chicken populations around the world by William M. Muir of Purdue University and colleagues has revealed the extent of the problem. Fifty percent or more of the diversity of ancestral breeds has been lost, they report in The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. That could make chicken production more susceptible to disease outbreaks for which resistant genes have disappeared.Sampling about 2,500 birds, the researchers looked at several thousand instances of genetic variation and used that to estimate what a hypothetical ancestral population looked like genetically. “Then we were able to say what is missing” in commercial birds, Dr. Muir said.Their findings indicate that most of the diversity was lost with the advent of wide-scale commercial production in the 1950s. Only a handful of hundreds of breeds have been crossed to produce broilers and layers.Dr. Muir said restoring some diversity was not simple a matter of crossing with more breeds — producers would lose the improvements they have made in existing lines. Instead, one approach would be to use genetic markers to aid in cross-breeding, “to select for the parts that are good,” he said.'"
"'08-11-04,'1','Women who gain more than 40 pounds during pregnancy are about twice as likely to give birth to a heavy baby as those who gain less, according to a large new study.Mothers of babies who weigh more than about nine pounds at birth are at greater risk for birth complications, and heavy babies are more likely to be overweight or obese later in life.It is well known that mothers with gestational diabetes are more likely to have large babies, but this study showed a strong effect of weight gain even in mothers who were not diabetic.The study, published in the November issue of Obstetrics and Gynecology, used data from 41,540 births from 1995 to 2003 at a large health plan in the Northwest and Hawaii.Among women who were not diabetic, 19 percent of those who gained more than 40 pounds had large babies, compared with 11 percent of those who gained less. Nondiabetic women who put on more than 40 pounds were more likely to have a large baby than women treated for diabetes who gained less.“Our study provides one more good reason for women to gain the ideal amount of weight during pregnancy,” said the lead author, Dr. Teresa A. Hillier, an endocrinologist at the Kaiser Permanente Center for Health Research in Portland, Ore., “and for physicians to do a better job counseling women about weight gain.”'"
"'08-11-04,'1','Pregnant women with symptoms of depression are at increased risk for premature delivery, a new study has found.The report, published online Oct. 23 in Human Reproduction, used a 20-question depression scale to interview 791 women early in their pregnancies. Scores on the questionnaire range from 0 to 60, with higher scores indicating more, and more frequent, depressive symptoms.After controlling for previous preterm births and miscarriages, socioeconomic status, education and other variables, the scientists found that compared with those who scored below 16, those with a score of 16 to 21 had a 60 percent increased risk of delivering prematurely. Women who scored 22 or higher had more than twice the risk.“Depression during pregnancy is frequently dismissed or underdiagnosed,” said Dr. De-Kun Li, the lead author. “I hope our study will raise a red flag.”Dr. Li, who is an epidemiologist at Kaiser Permanente’s research division in Oakland, Calif., said that the safety of antidepressant use during pregnancy was not known, but that treatment did not have to involve drugs. “Support from peers, family and friends can help,” he said. “If you do have to use medication, you have to weigh the risks and benefits with your doctor.”'"
"'08-11-04,'1','It helps that he now has the rookie running back Matt Forte behind him. Forte is the league’s seventh-leading rusher, with 641 yards. He had 101 yards in the second half Sunday, when the Bears needed him most.Maybe the Bears can copy the formula the Titans have used with Kerry Collins, who has demonstrated the value of a competent backup (pay attention, Cowboys): Pound opponents with defense and a running game, and make the quarterback win games only when necessary.We may soon get a look at the ultimate backup quarterback quandary — or is it a starting quarterback quandary? The Browns were 37-27 losers on Sunday to the Ravens and their rookie quarterback Joe Flacco. Cleveland Coach Romeo Crennel said Monday that a change was coming.“We didn’t do enough in the passing game,” Crennel said.That has been a theme this year for quarterback Derek Anderson, whose completion rate is below 50 percent and who was foiled by a confounding Braylon Edwards drop — confounding because Edwards didn’t talk to the news media to explain what happened — and a Terrell Suggs interception that was returned for a touchdown. Last year, Anderson was the N.F.L.’s Cinderella story at quarterback as the Browns made a playoff push. But he faded late in the season.Cleveland’s defense is largely to blame for Sunday’s collapse — 37 points to the Ravens?On Monday, Crennel said Anderson was his quarterback “as of right now.” By Monday night Anderson wasn’t his quarterback, after all. The former first-round pick Brady Quinn will start Thursday against the Broncos.But it’s clear this is not the Browns’ year. The Steelers and the Ravens are ahead of them and figure to battle for the American Football Conference North the rest of the way, and it will soon be time to see if they have the right quarterback in waiting.A scene in the Cowboys’ locker room just about summed up one of their biggest problems. After Dallas’s 35-14 loss to the Giants on Sunday, reporters approached receiver Terrell Owens, who had fumbled.“There’s no question I’m a capable receiver,” he said, according to The Fort Worth Star-Telegram. What he did not have to say was that he did not think the current Cowboys quarterbacks were quite as capable, and certainly not capable enough to get the wide receivers the ball. Brad Johnson and Brooks Bollinger have been dreadful; the Cowboys have had only three passes of more than 20 yards in the past two games.The team’s owner, Jerry Jones, spent most of his postgame session with reporters trying to explain why the Cowboys, who spent more than $80 million in bonuses this year, thought they could exist with no safety net behind Romo. But it was not Romo or Johnson or Bollinger who was stripped of the ball. And it certainly was not one of them waving Giants running back Brandon Jacobs through the defense.But really, while Owens thought he was talking about his talent, he was actually revealing something about the Cowboys’ foundation. Isn’t one of the syrupy clichés of sports that teams win together and lose together? Nobody should have expected that from a Cowboys team that was assembled, appropriately considering they are new business partners, from the outdated playbook of the early 1990s Yankees: overpay for big names and watch the team descend into a quagmire of personal interest.Earlier this season, Owens complained about not being thrown to enough, and that was after the Cowboys’ first loss. Romo, by the way, was the quarterback.Coach Wade Phillips seems likely to survive the bye week, a traditionally dangerous time for coaches of troubled teams, because the Cowboys have few options. What would they do, turn the team over to Jason Garrett, who was the offense’s boy wonder back in the good old days of September? Instead, Phillips will probably be gone after this season if the Cowboys do not reach the playoffs and make a run.Dallas is a spectacularly talented team with possibly the best roster in the game. But no team has ever needed its bye week more. They will probably get Romo, running back Felix Jones and maybe cornerback Terence Newman back in two weeks. That will certainly help, but the Cowboys lost two games with Romo. The Cowboys need to win five of their last seven just to get to 10 victories, and even Jerry Jones, an eternal optimist who assembled this dysfunctional group, admitted he would gladly take a playoff spot right now. He knows how fragile his team is.But maybe team chemistry is finally taking hold. After all, the latest big name to join the roster, receiver Roy Williams, told reporters he was “fine” after the game, the same word Owens used. “It’s frustrating for me, because I’m on the sidelines,” Williams said. “You can’t do nothing on the sidelines.” He added: “I’m on the sideline waiting. I feel like I’m in high school.”Sounds as if he’s fitting right in.'"
"'08-11-04,'1','His visit comes as the Pentagon and the White House are completing reviews on policies toward Afghanistan, and as Barack Obama, the Democratic presidential nominee, has made clear that Pakistan and Afghanistan would be more of a foreign policy focus if he were to win the election. In an interview on CNN broadcast this past weekend, Mr. Obama said he believed it was necessary to convince Pakistan that the main threat to its security came from the militants, and not India, its historical enemy.During his round of calls on Monday, General Petraeus met with the commander of the Pakistani military, Gen. Ashfaq Parvez Kayani, and the defense minister, Ahmad Mukhtar.The American missile attacks in the tribal areas were generating “anti-American sentiments” and creating “outrage and uproar among the people,” Mr. Mukhtar said in a statement.A senior Pakistani military official said the army wanted to “bring home the point that the missile strikes are counterproductive, and that this is driving a wedge between the government and the tribal people.”Pakistani officials have consistently complained about the airstrikes that have been aimed at Arab fighters and Pakistani militants connected to Al Qaeda.But the statements against the airstrikes have been couched in less dramatic language than General Kayani’s declaration after an American ground raid in September in which he said Pakistan would defend its borders at “all costs.” There have been no known ground raids in the tribal areas since.On a more positive note, the senior Pakistani military official, who declined to be identified because of the sensitivity of the subject, said the United States had started “listening to us” and had moved toward sealing the border between Afghanistan and Pakistan in the Bajaur area.The Pakistani Army is fighting Taliban militants in Bajaur and has criticized the United States for what it says is the failure of American troops in Afghanistan to stop Afghan militants from crossing into Bajaur and joining the battle.The Americans moved some of their forces to the east of the Kunar River last week, and this helped curb the flow of militants into Bajaur, the Pakistani military official said. “It is bearing positive results,” he said.In an effort to show General Petraeus the hard terrain that the Pakistani forces face against the insurgents in the tribal areas, the military planned to fly him over some of the terrain on Tuesday, the military official said.That way, the general would get an idea of the long, porous border between Afghanistan and Pakistan. “We will let him see where the roads end and where the mountains start,” the official said.“It will be a glimpse of the Tora Bora from the other side,” he said, referring to the area in Afghanistan near the Pakistani border from where Osama bin Laden is believed to have escaped from American troops in late 2001.In a visit Tuesday to Peshawar, in the North-West Frontier Province, General Petraeus planned to meet with Maj. Gen. Tariq Khan, the new leader of the Frontier Corps, the paramilitary force that is fighting in Bajaur.After a long delay, American and British trainers began instructing Pakistani officers last month, who in turn will train the Frontier Corps in an effort to turn the paramilitary force into a more effective group of indigenous counterinsurgency fighters.The Pakistani military officials planned to ask General Petraeus for help in increasing the army’s “operational capabilities,” meaning equipment. But the army was reluctant to accept training. “Why should they get into our areas?” the senior military official asked.'"
"'08-11-04,'1','Markets worldwide were buffeted in the third quarter, when the investment bank Lehman Brothers collapsed and the insurance giant American International Group received a bailout. Interbank lending largely ground to a halt in the quarter.After factoring out the turmoil, Mr. Tazi said, the effect of the slowing global economy is evident in terms of declining asset quality. “This is going to continue for a number of quarters,” he said.The Commerzbank chief executive, Martin Blessing, said the government’s aid would be in the form of “silent participation” — meaning there would be little dilution to shareholders’ interest. The state’s infusion of cash will raise the bank’s core capital ratio, a crucial measure of financial strength, to 11.2 percent, Commerzbank said. The bank will pay no dividend in 2009 or 2010, and will limit Mr. Blessing’s pay to 500,000 euros a year.Commerzbank said in August that it would pay 9.8 billion euros to buy Dresdner Bank from the insurance company, Allianz. The government cash will allow that deal to go ahead without requiring Commerzbank to raise more capital from private investors.The German government agreed to guarantee 15 billion euros of new Commerzbank debt as part of the bailout. Mr. Blessing said the bank had no immediate need for the guarantee, but that it offered “additional and attractive refinancing options, in case markets should deteriorate again.”Commerzbank also posted a third-quarter net loss of 285 million euros, compared with year-earlier profit of 339 million euros, and wrote down 952 million euros in investments.Last week, Hypo Real Estate, a mortgage lender, said it would seek 500 billion euros from the government and BayernLB, a regional state-owned lender, said it would seek 5.4 billion euros. Deutsche Bank, the biggest German lender, reiterated Sunday that it had no plans to seek government funds.In Edinburgh, HBOS, the British mortgage lender that is selling itself to Lloyds TSB with government help, said Monday that its losses grew sharply in the first nine months. It said it had booked impairment charges of £1.7 billion, or $2.8 billion, for soured loans in its corporate division, and had lost £1.8 billion on its treasury portfolio. It said further losses of £150 million were likely in relation to losses on Icelandic bank investments.Lloyds TSB is planning to buy HBOS in a deal worth more than £6 billion. A deal is contingent on the banks raising £17 billion through a government-backed share offering that would leave the British Treasury the biggest investor. The banks said the deal remained on track.For its part, Lloyds said Monday that it expected to write off £300 million in corporate loans in the second half, and that it would most likely book an additional £120 million charge related to declining real estate prices.Shares of Commerzbank rose 1.6 percent in Frankfurt afternoon trading, while Société Générale rose 0.2 percent in Paris. In London, shares of HBOS rose 3.2 percent, and Lloyds TSB fell 2.2 percent.'"

Governor Minner was prevented by a term limits law from running again.Mr. Markell, who defeated Bill Lee, a Republican and former judge, will become the first Jewish governor in Delaware history.Two Republican incumbents, Gov. Jon M. Huntsman Jr. of Utah and Gov. John Hoeven of North Dakota, also won re-election, as did Gov. Brian Schweitzer, a Democrat, in Montana. All three are popular, and they highlighted their state’s economic performances, which compared favorably with their neighbors.Mr. Hoeven, in winning a third four-year term, became the first governor in North Dakota history to push past eight years in office. He defeated Tim Mathern, a Democrat and 22-year veteran of the State Senate, who has a classic North Dakota pedigree as the great-grandson of homesteaders and who grew up on a dairy farm with 12 brothers and sisters.Mr. Schweitzer, who narrowly won his first term in 2004, has become a spokesman for the Western Democrats who have made inroads from Wyoming to Colorado. He defeated Roy Brown, a Republican state senator from Billings. Mr. Brown, a petroleum engineer, campaigned on a pledge to reduce the role of government in people’s lives.Mr. Huntsman, a former United States trade representative who is fluent in Mandarin Chinese — partly from his experience as a missionary for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints — coasted to re-election in Utah over Bob Springmeyer, a Democrat and management consultant.All the incoming governors will have to deal with tough economic challenges. New Hampshire, for example, faces a budget deficit of $160 million, almost 10 percent of the general revenue budget.In Indiana, the economy was a major issue. Mr. Daniels argued that the state was suffering less than its neighbors, and that he deserved credit. Ms. Thompson pointed to the state’s housing foreclosures, which were higher than the national average.In Missouri, Mr. Nixon benefited from having a much longer lead time in his campaign. He was the favorite to win his party’s nomination even before Governor Blunt’s surprise announcement earlier this year that he would not seek re-election, which left the Republicans scrambling to find a candidate.Mr. Nixon, who was the longest-serving attorney general in state history, cast Mr. Hulshof as a Washington insider who had been tainted by his time in Congress.“Jay was well known and thought of; he jumped out early, and worked hard over last year, year and a half,” said Mr. Manchin, who is the chairman of the Democratic Governors Association.In his own race, Mr. Manchin portrayed himself as a local boy — an avid outdoorsman and motorcyclist, and a native of a coal mining town whose grandparents had immigrated from Italy — who knew his state, but who also had a vision beyond it, in energy and education policy.In Delaware, Mr. Markell campaigned heavily on health care. He highlighted his work as state treasurer in reducing health insurance costs by encouraging healthier behavior and lifestyles for state employees. He also portrayed himself as something of an efficiency expert, touting his success in saving money for the state through bulk purchases.'"
"'08-11-05,'0','“We had a feeling this would happen,” Ricciardi said at the hotel where general managers are holding their annual meetings this week. “He may explore other things, but we think we are a good fit for him.”Even as Burnett was cutting ties with the Blue Jays, the Yankees were doing the same with Jason Giambi and Carl Pavano. Instead of picking up Giambi’s $22 million option for next season, the Yankees, as expected, gave him a $5 million buyout. The Yankees also held an option to pay the injury-plagued Pavano $13 million next season, but the team instead bought him out for $1.95 million.“Given the circumstances and the money that was involved, I don’t think it’s surprising to anyone that we didn’t pick the options up,” Cashman said.The free agent Mark Teixeira, who may or may not sign with the Los Angeles Angels, the club he was traded to last summer, is probably the Yankees’ top choice to play first base next season. It is possible the Yankees will have to battle the Red Sox to sign him.If the Red Sox sign Teixeira, a 28-year-old switch hitter, it would force them to move first baseman Kevin Youkilis to third base or perhaps left field. Youkilis played a good deal of third in 2008 after Mike Lowell sustained a hip injury that required an operation.Teixeira’s agent, Scott Boras, said that there were teams willing to move players around to sign his client.Boras was also asked about one of his other clients, the free agent Manny Ramírez, whose second-half surge after he joined the Los Angeles Dodgers reaffirmed his status as one of the game’s best hitters. But Ramírez is also 36, with an unmatched reputation for unpredictability. Boras would only say that he has had discussions with Dodgers officials, who would like to keep Ramírez but probably not for the number of years Boras is seeking.Because Cashman is seeking to make the Yankees younger and more athletic, it is unlikely he will be interested in bringing back Giambi, 37, who can barely run or throw and always seems in danger of being injured. But it is not out of the question that the Yankees could offer Giambi a one-year deal with incentives if they fail to sign Teixeira. Giambi’s seven years with the Yankees did not produce a World Series title and did generate many unhappy headlines about performance-enhancing drugs, but he can still hit.Cashman said that “all options are on the table” about re-signing Giambi and Pavano, although Pavano would probably only be brought back as insurance, not as a starter.The A’s, with whom Giambi spent the first seven years of his career, said on Tuesday that Bob Alejo, who had been Giambi’s personal trainer and was the A’s strength and conditioning coach from 1993 to 2001, was returning for another stint as the team’s director of strength and conditioning. That gives Oakland one more link to Giambi, and could help to lure him back to the West Coast.'"
"'08-11-05,'0','New York City’s antiquated voting system buckled, groaned and occasionally even gave way on Tuesday as millions of people thronged the polls to cast votes in the presidential election. Persistent problems from past elections — broken machines, long waits and confusion among poll workers — were made even worse, voters and election observers said, by an exceptionally heavy turnout.The city’s mechanical-lever voting machines, in use since 1962, broke down in neighborhoods from Washington Heights, Harlem and the Upper West Side in Manhattan to Cobble Hill and Crown Heights in Brooklyn and Long Island City, Queens. While the Board of Elections dispatched teams of technicians around the city, voters who had already waited for hours had to wait even longer to fill out emergency paper ballots.“It’s a mess,” said Marjorie Press Lindblom, a partner at the law firm of Kirkland & Ellis, who ran one of the New York emergency phone lines for Election Protection, a nonpartisan national voter protection program. “People have had to wait hours. Machines are breaking down. There’s confusion about the use of emergency versus affidavit ballots. Voters are not showing up on registration lists. And poll workers haven’t all been trained properly.”By the late afternoon, Election Protection had received roughly 3,000 complaints from voters across the five boroughs, with Brooklyn and Manhattan accounting for about two-thirds of the total.Despite the troubles, there were no complaints of widespread disenfranchisement or fraud.Valerie Vazquez-Rivera, a spokeswoman for the Board of Elections, acknowledged the complaints, which she attributed in part to “an unprecedented number of voters at the polls.” The city’s 34,000 poll workers, who are paid $200 to $300 for a day’s work, tried their best to help voters at 1,351 polling sites, she said.'"
"'08-11-05,'0','These swaps are contracts between two investors — typically banks, hedge funds and other institutions — and they are not traded on exchanges. The face value of the credit-default market has soared to an estimated $55 trillion.Credit-default swaps, though intended to spread risk, have magnified the financial crisis because the market is unregulated, obscure and brimming with counterparty risk (that is, the risk that one embattled bank or firm will not be able to meet its payment obligations, and that trading with it will seize up).The market for credit-default swaps has been at the center of the recent Wall Street banking failures and rescues, and these instruments embody the kinds of risks not easily captured in math formulas.“Complexity, transparency, liquidity and leverage have all played a huge role in this crisis,” said Leslie Rahl, president of Capital Market Risk Advisors, a risk-management consulting firm. “And these are things that are not generally modeled as a quantifiable risk.”Math, statistics and computer modeling, it seems, also fell short in calibrating the lending risk on individual mortgage loans. In recent years, the securitization of the mortgage market, with loans sold off and mixed into large pools of mortgage securities, has prompted lenders to move increasingly to automated underwriting systems, relying mainly on computerized credit-scoring models instead of human judgment.So lenders had scant incentive to spend much time scrutinizing the creditworthiness of individual borrowers. “If the incentives and the systems change, the hard data can mean less than it did or something else than it did,” said Raghuram G. Rajan, a professor at the University of Chicago. “The danger is that the modeling becomes too mechanical.”Mr. Rajan, a former chief economist at the International Monetary Fund, points to a new paper co-authored by a University of Chicago colleague, Amit Seru, “The Failure of Models That Predict Failure,” which looked at securitized subprime loans issued from 1997-2006. Their research concluded that the quantitative methods underestimated defaults for subprime borrowers in what the paper called “a systematic failure of default models.”A recent paper by four Federal Reserve economists, “Making Sense of the Subprime Crisis,” found another cause. They surveyed the published research reports by Wall Street analysts and economists, and asked why the Wall Street experts failed to foresee the surge in subprime foreclosures in 2007 and 2008. The Fed economists concluded that the risk models used by Wall Street analysts correctly predicted that a drop in real estate prices of 10 or 20 percent would imperil the market for subprime mortgage-backed securities. But the analysts themselves assigned a very low probability to that happening.The miss by Wall Street analysts shows how models can be precise out to several decimal places, and yet be totally off base. The analysts, according to the Fed paper, doggedly clung to the optimists’ mantra that nominal housing prices in the United States had not declined in decades — even though house prices did fall nationally, adjusted for inflation, in the 1970s, and there are many sizable regional declines over the years.Besides, the formation of a housing bubble was well under way. Until 2003, prices moved in line with employment, incomes and migration patterns, but then they departed from the economic fundamentals.The Wall Street models, said Paul S. Willen, an economist at the Federal Reserve in Boston, included a lot of wishful thinking about house prices. But, he added, it is also true that asset price trends are difficult to predict. “The price of an asset, like a house or a stock, reflects not only your beliefs about the future, but you’re also betting on other people’s beliefs,” he observed. “It’s these hierarchies of beliefs — these behavioral factors — that are so hard to model.”Indeed, the behavioral uncertainty added to the escalating complexity of financial markets help explain the failure in risk management. The quantitative models typically have their origins in academia and often the physical sciences. In academia, the focus is on problems that can be solved, proved and published — not messy, intractable challenges. In science, the models derive from particle flows in a liquid or a gas, which conform to the neat, crisp laws of physics.Not so in financial modeling. Emanuel Derman is a physicist who became a managing director at Goldman Sachs, a quant whose name is on a few financial models and author of “My Life as a Quant — Reflections on Physics and Finance” (Wiley, 2004). In a paper that will be published next year in a professional journal, Mr. Derman writes, “To confuse the model with the world is to embrace a future disaster driven by the belief that humans obey mathematical rules.”Yet blaming the models for their shortcomings, he said in an interview, seems misguided. “The models were more a tool of enthusiasm than a cause of the crisis,” said Mr. Derman, who is a professor at Columbia University.In boom times, new markets tend to outpace the human and technical systems to support them, said Richard R. Lindsey, president of the Callcott Group, a quantitative consulting group. Those support systems, he said, include pricing and risk models, back-office clearing and management’s understanding of the financial instruments. That is what happened in the mortgage-backed securities and credit derivatives markets.Better modeling, more wisely applied, would have helped, Mr. Lindsey said, but so would have common sense in senior management. The mortgage securities markets, he noted, grew rapidly and generated high profits for a decade. “If you are making a high return, I guarantee you there is a high risk there, even if you can’t see it,” said Mr. Lindsey, a former chief economist of the Securities and Exchange Commission.Among quants, some recognized the gathering storm. Mr. Lo, the director of M.I.T. Laboratory for Financial Engineering, co-wrote a paper that he presented in October 2004 at a National Bureau of Economic Research conference. The research paper warned of the rising systemic risk to financial markets and particularly focused on the potential liquidity, leverage and counterparty risk from hedge funds.Over the next two years, Mr. Lo also made presentations to Federal Reserve officials in New York and Washington, and before the European Central Bank in Brussels. Among economists and academics, he said, the research was well received. “On the industry side, it was dismissed,” he recalled.The dismissive response, Mr. Lo said, was not really surprising because Wall Street was going to chase profits in the good times. The path to sensible restraint, he said, will include not only better risk models, but also more regulation. Like others, Mr. Lo recommends higher capital requirements for banks and the use of exchanges or clearinghouses for the trade of exotic securities, so that prices and risks are more visible. Any hedge fund with more than $1 billion in assets, he added, should be compelled to report its holdings to regulators.Financial regulation, Mr. Lo said, should be seen as similar to fire safety rules in building codes. The chances of any building burning down are slight, but ceiling sprinklers, fire extinguishers and fire escapes are mandated by law.“We’ve learned the hard way that the consequences can be catastrophic, even if statistically improbable,” he said.'"
"'08-11-05,'0','The heated debate dividing neighbors is likely to repeat itself across town later this month, when city education officials begin discussing the rezoning of parts of District 2, which encompasses the Upper East Side and much of Lower Manhattan. District 2 is plagued by some of the city’s worst overcrowding, particularly in TriBeCa and on the Upper East Side.In the debate over the fate of P.S. 199 and the Center School, there have been accusations of racism, and a flier calling one school administrator who opposed a move a dictator. Parents — and prospective parents — of P.S. 199 have set up an elaborate campaign against changing the school boundaries, using the Internet and old-fashioned petitions on clipboards to protest.“You move to a neighborhood in no small part because you are attracted to the school — it’s a core decision you are making,” said Eric Shuffler, who is among the parents of 4-year-olds fighting for kindergarten spots in 2009 at P.S. 199. “Something that you had planned on is now being taken and it’s compounded by the fact that you don’t know what happens to your children once the decision is made.”As Education Department officials and local community boards grapple with pockets of overcrowding in parts of Manhattan where real estate has boomed, they are trying to balance competing ideals.Do young children who live within blocks of a school have inherent rights to enroll there? What about the middle school that has been housed in the building for more than two decades? Should school choice trump geography? Or should schools reflect precisely the neighborhoods that surround them, even if that means aligning with segregated housing patterns?“What they need to do is look at how schools actually function,” said Jennifer Freeman, a member of the Community Education Council in District 3. “We’re trying to make as big of an improvement as possible with the least amount of disruption as possible.”For many parents and their advocates, the only acceptable answer to the overcrowding is to build more schools. But the city’s capital plan, expected to be released on Wednesday, is unlikely to appease them. Facing a bleak economic picture and austere budget, the Education Department is scaling back its ambitions for new buildings or even modest additions. And city officials have been loath to devote scant capital resources to neighborhoods that it believes can and should address overcrowding within existing buildings.“These are constant, ongoing reassessments: where the population is dynamic, where the population growth has been rapid, and where that is not the case,” said John White, the Education Department official with the task of addressing enrollment issues. “In some cases, by changing the specific manner that students choose a school we can address the issue.”In District 3, education officials initially proposed changing zones to reassign residents of West 67th, 68th, 69th, 70th and 71st Streets, between Central Park West and Broadway, to Public School 87, a few blocks north, rather than P.S. 199. Mr. White said the city also suggested changing a districtwide policy that sets aside some seats at each school for people who live outside its boundaries. Many parents in the district bristled at both ideas, saying that they prized the diversity that the current policies create.Several of the neighborhood’s schools attract students from surrounding areas because of gifted and talented, special education or dual-language classrooms.The department also floated a plan to move schools that shared buildings, placing the Center School at Public School 9, and moving the Anderson School, a citywide gifted program, from its current location at P.S. 9 to Middle School 44 on 77th Street.But the principal, teachers and parents of the Center School have protested, saying that it is unfair and damaging to move them from the building they have occupied since the school opened in 1983.“We have no interest in changing, because the kids who have gone here come back here all the time,” said Elaine Schwartz, who has been the principal since the school opened. “For them it was a community that they recognize.” The school capped its enrollment at just under 300 years ago, Ms. Schwartz added, and the slightly crowded space is what they now “thrive” in.“Moving would be very destructive,” she said with frustration. “Can I worry about the real estate situation in New York?” Of the P.S. 199 parents wary of P.S. 191, Ms. Schwartz said: “There’s a school right nearby — if they were being offered some trashy place, or no place at all, maybe I would understand better.”At its core, the battle over rezoning is also about where parents are eager — or even willing — to send their children. Schools, for better or worse, have built up reputations over a number of years. At times, such reputations can change significantly with a new principal or new program. This year, for example, Public School 84, on 92nd Street, experienced a surge in popularity after a French dual-language program was introduced.Parents who are delighted to send their children to Public School 75 — a school on West End Avenue and 95th Street whose dual-language Spanish program helped it reach capacity several years ago — are often wary of Public School 145 on 105th Street, which has less than half the students it can take. Similarly, parents of future students at P.S. 199 are skeptical that they would be as happy at P.S. 191 on 61st Street, where 64 percent of the students are in poverty, according to the Education Department, and 8 percent of the students are white (compared with 10 percent in poverty and 66 percent white at P.S. 199).Privately, the parents confide in one another about their fears: They do not know anyone who goes to P.S. 191. They worry their children will feel out of place, or not be challenged academically (last year, 52 percent of P.S. 191 students met state standards in reading, and 70 percent did so in math, compared with more than 90 percent in both subjects at P.S. 199). Some see these fears as a kind of quiet racism, but the parents argue that they simply do not want to send their children to a low-performing school.“Part of the reason you pay a premium is to be able to go to a local school,” said Nicole Auerbach, who chose to renovate her apartment and stay within P.S. 199’s zone, rather than follow many of her friends to the suburbs as the children reached school age. “Maybe if all of the folks I know who are upset about 199 were also going to go to 191, I might feel better.“The problem is that they’ve caused sufficient panic that everyone is scrambling,” Ms. Auerbach added. “Some people might move, and some people might try to put their kids in private schools.”'"
"'08-11-05,'0','SPRINGFIELD, Mass. — Opening statements took place Tuesday in the trial of a man accused of beating his stepdaughter into a coma in 2005 in a case that spurred an unusual end-of-life battle and led Massachusetts to overhaul its child welfare laws.The case drew national attention because the state moved, against the stepfather’s wishes, to terminate life support after doctors declared the child, Haleigh Poutre, then 11, gravely brain damaged.The Massachusetts Supreme Court backed the decision, but soon after, the state announced that Haleigh was breathing on her own and responding to stimuli. She now lives in a rehabilitation center and communicates by way of an alphabet board.Laurel Brandt, an assistant district attorney in Hampden County, said witnesses for the prosecution would include Haleigh’s younger sister, who she said would testify that she saw the stepfather, Jason D. Strickland, push Haleigh down a flight of stairs on the day she sustained her injuries. In addition, she said, doctors would testify that Haleigh’s injuries could not have been self-inflicted, as the Strickland family had originally claimed.Ms. Brandt said that after throwing Haleigh down the basement stairs, Mr. Strickland carried her unresponsive, bloody body to the bathtub and left her to “sleep” for over a day.She said Mr. Strickland committed the crime with his wife, Holli, who was Haleigh’s biological aunt but had taken custody of her in 1998. Mrs. Strickland died in an apparent murder-suicide with her grandmother shortly after being charged with the crime in 2005.'"
"'08-11-05,'0','“They didn’t give us our mule and our acre, but things are better,” Miss Harris, 67, said with a gratified smile. “It’s time to reap some of the harvest.”When Miss Harris arrived at the city gymnasium where she votes, her 80-year-old friend Mamie L. Nelson greeted her with a hug. “We marched, we sang and now it’s happening,” Ms. Nelson said. “It’s really a feeling I cannot describe.”Many, like the Rev. Horace C. Boyd, who was then and is now pastor of Shiloh Baptist Church, viewed the moment through the prism of biblical prophecy. If Dr. King was the movement’s Moses, doomed to die without crossing the Jordan, it would fall to Mr. Obama to be its Joshua, they said.“King made the statement that he viewed the Promised Land, won’t get there, but somebody will get there, and that day has dawned,” said Mr. Boyd, 81, who pushed his wife in a wheelchair to the polls late Tuesday morning. “I’m glad that it has.”It was a day most never imagined that they would live to see. From their vantage point amid the cotton fields and pecan groves of Dougherty County, where the movement for voting rights faced some of its most determined resistance, the country simply did not seem ready.Yes, the world had changed in 47 years. At City Hall, the offices once occupied by the segregationist mayor, Asa D. Kelley Jr., and the police chief, Laurie Pritchett, are now filled by Mayor Willie Adams and Chief James Younger, both of whom are black. But much in this black-majority city of 75,000 also seems the same: neighborhoods remain starkly delineated by race, blacks are still five times more likely than whites to live in poverty and the public schools have so resegregated that 9 of every 10 students are black.Miss Harris, a retired special education teacher who was jailed three times in 1961 and 1962, was so convinced that Mr. Obama could not win white support that she backed Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton in the primaries. “I just didn’t feel it was time for a black man, to be honest,” she said. “But the Lord has revealed to me that it is time for a change.”Late Tuesday night, when the networks declared Mr. Obama the winner, Miss Harris could not hold back the tears, the emotions of a lifetime released in a flood. She shared a lengthy embrace with friends gathered at the Obama headquarters, and then led the exultant crowd in song.“Glory, glory, hallelujah,” she sang. After a prayer, she joined the crowd in chanting, “Yes, we did!”Among the things Miss Harris appreciates about Mr. Obama is that even though he was in diapers while she was in jail, he seems to respect what came before. “He’s of a different time and place, but he knows whose shoulders he’s standing on,” she said.When the movement came to Albany in 1961, fewer than 100 of Dougherty County’s 20,000 black residents were registered to vote, said the Rev. Charles M. Sherrod, one of the first field workers sent here by the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee. Literacy tests made a mockery of due process — Mr. Boyd remembers being asked by a registrar how many bubbles were in a bar of soap — and bosses made it clear to black workers that registration might be incompatible with continued employment.Lucius Holloway Sr., 76, said he lost his job as a post office custodian after he began registering voters in neighboring Terrell County. He said he was shunned by other blacks who hated him for the trouble he incited.Now Mr. Holloway is a member of the county commission, and when he voted for Mr. Obama last week he said his pride was overwhelming. “Thank you, Jesus, I lived to see the fruit of my labor,” he said.The Albany movement spread with frenzied abandon after the arrival of Mr. Sherrod and other voting-rights organizers, and Dr. King devoted nearly a year to the effort. The protests became known for the exuberant songs that Miss Harris and others adapted from Negro spirituals. (She would go on to become one of the Freedom Singers, a group that traveled the country as heralds for the civil rights movement.) In the jails, the music helped wile away time and soothe the soul, just as they had in the fields a century before.But the movement met its match in Albany’s recalcitrant white leaders, who filled the jails with demonstrators while avoiding the kind of violence that drew media outrage and federal intervention in other civil rights battlegrounds. The energy gradually drained from the protests, and Dr. King moved on to Birmingham, counting Albany as a tactical failure.Mr. Sherrod, 71, who settled in Albany and continues to lead a civil rights group here, argues that the movement succeeded; it simply took time. He said he felt the weight of that history when he voted last Thursday morning, after receiving radiation treatment for his prostate cancer. He thought of the hundreds of mass meetings, of the songs of hope and the sermons of deliverance. “This is what we prayed for, this is what we worked for,” he said. “We have a legitimate chance to be a democracy.”Over and again, the civil rights veterans drew direct lines between their work and the colorblindness of Mr. Obama’s candidacy. But they emphasized that they did not vote for him simply because of his race.“I think he would make just as good a president as any one of those whites ever made, that’s what I think about it,” said 103-year-old Daisy Newsome, who knocked on doors to register voters “until my hand was sore,” and was jailed in 1961 during a march that started at Mount Zion Baptist. “It ain’t because he’s black, because I’ve voted for the whites.” She added, “I know he can’t be no worse than what there’s done been.”Mount Zion has now been preserved as a landmark, attached to a new $4 million civil rights museum that was financed through a voter-approved sales tax increase. Across the street, Shiloh Baptist, founded in 1888, still holds services in the sanctuary where Dr. King preached at mass meetings.Among those leading Sunday’s worship was the associate pastor, Henry L. Mathis, 53, a former city commissioner whose grandmother was a movement stalwart. He could not let the moment pass without looking back.“We are standing on Jordan’s stony banks, and we’re casting a wishful eye to Canaan’s fair and happy land,” Mr. Mathis preached. “We sang through the years that we shall overcome, but our Father, our God, we pray now that you show that we have overcome.”'"
"'08-11-05,'0','A window into the vast, murky world of credit-default swaps opened on Tuesday — and the view was a bit surprising.The market for the instruments, which have played a significant role in the financial crisis, seems to be smaller than many analysts believed. And countries, not just companies, are often the subject of contracts that are used to protect investors against losses from defaults or simply to make bearish bets.That, anyway, is the impression given by a report released by the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation that ostensibly provides the most data yet on this market. But the report does not shed any new light on which entities have sold protection through swaps and whether they have enough capital to meet their obligations, a crucial concern for policy makers.The depository corporation, which clears swaps and other financial transactions, said that it had cleared swaps providing coverage on $33.6 trillion in debt. In other words, investors have bought (or sold) protection on bonds and other debt totaling that much, an amount that is slightly greater than the $30.8 trillion of American bonds outstanding.Last month, the International Swaps and Derivatives Association estimated that nearly $47 trillion in swaps were outstanding as of June. That number might include transactions not cleared by the depository corporation.The most default swaps have been written on the countries of Turkey, Italy, Brazil and Russia, according to the new data. They were followed by GMAC, the auto finance company that is partly owned by General Motors. Others in the top 10 include Merrill Lynch, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, General Electric Capital and Countrywide Home Loans. But that ranking does not account for contracts written on multiple units of the same companies.'"
"'08-11-05,'0','Alabama, with its heavy reliance on sales and income tax revenues to finance schools, may be even more vulnerable than most states. Revenues in the main state school fund in October were down more than 13 percent from the previous year, though some money had not been deposited by the end of the month. Still, the state finance director, Jim Main, acknowledged that sales taxes were down 5 to 6 percent in October.Pink slips may be coming, as payrolls are threatened. The 63,000-student Mobile County school district had to draw $18 million from its line of credit to make a recent payroll, said Lori Zirlott, the district comptroller.The state superintendent of education, Joe Morton, said late last week, referring to school payrolls, “I think everybody met it today.”“Some had to move things around and make arrangements,” Dr. Morton said. “I think it’s the beginning of a trend.”Mr. Main called the temporary 25 percent cut to local school districts a “cash flow issue” caused by the lack of leftover money from the previous fiscal year, and pointed out that the state schools budget had grown by about $2 billion over four years, to $6.4 billion.Officials are having to dip into November revenues to make the October state payment of about $339 million to the districts. “The trend is not looking good,” Mr. Morton said. Spending cuts are possible, officials said — a prospect that the struggling small school districts in a rural state dread.“We have some real successful programs that are in the initial stages, that if we have to do cuts it will be devastating,” said Ginger East, superintendent of the 3,200-student Tallapoosa County school system, mentioning a handful of special reading and math courses. “All of those will take large cuts if the state can’t provide us with funding.” Ms. East said the district had met its payroll thanks to a carefully tended surplus of $2.5 million built up over four years.But these surpluses will not last long, officials warn. “Fortunately some of the local districts have saved up reserve funds that they can now use in times like these,” said Paul Hubbert, executive secretary of the Alabama Education Association, the state’s influential teacher lobby. But “it’s a very short time that they can go to their own reserves,” said Dr. Hubbert — a matter of a few months, in some cases.In the poorest sections of a poor state, the so-called Black Belt or old plantation-country counties across its midsection, margins are even tighter. “We were able to make payroll because we’ve done drastic cutbacks in staffing and supplies over the last few years,” said Rosie Shamburger, superintendent of the Wilcox County schools, pointing out that over half of her 2,100-student district’s support personnel had been cut. Those cuts went to help build “a little reserve,” about $1.5 million, “to meet the payroll, but I don’t know how long we’ll be able to do so,” she said.“We’re holding back funding in a lot of areas,” Dr. Shamburger said. “We’re going to have to put off buying computers,” and an automobile-service training course planned for next year would probably be cut as well.Meanwhile, Dr. Morton, the state superintendent, was hoping that Alabama voters would pass a special measure on Tuesday’s ballot that would allow the state to borrow nearly $200 million more — up to $435 million — for schools, against the state’s multibillion-dollar natural gas trust fund. Some traditional conservative forces in the state, the Alabama Farmers Federation, for instance, have lined up against the measure. But the governor, education leaders and major newspapers are for it.The declining tax revenues and possible spending cuts, Dr. Morton said, “just points to the need to pass this.”'"
"'08-11-05,'0','ZURICH (AP) — The Swiss Reinsurance Company posted an unexpected third-quarter loss on Tuesday as a result of hurricane damage, losses at its life and health business and markdowns on assets from the global financial turmoil.The company said it lost 304 million Swiss francs ($258 million), or 0.93 francs (79 cents) a share, in the period, reversing a profit of $1.47 billion, or 4.20 francs ($3.62) a share, a year earlier. Analysts had expected the company to record a profit of about 340 million francs ($289 million).Swiss Re said it would suspend its share buyback program, but said it believed it could still complete the repurchase at a cost of 7.75 billion francs by April 2010 if global financial conditions improved.The company, based here, said it lost 76 million francs ($65 million) on bad investments during the quarter. That is in contrast to a profit of 1.75 billion francs ($1.5 billion) during the third quarter of 2007.In its core businesses, Swiss Re took in 3.61 billion francs ($3.07 billion) in premiums from property and casualty insurance, and 2.92 billion francs ($2.49 billion) from life and health insurance, down from 4.78 billion francs ($4.1 billion) and 3.04 billion francs ($2.6 billion).Operating income from property and casualty was 99 million francs ($84 million), while the life and health business recorded an operating loss of 614 million francs ($524 million).'"
"'08-11-05,'0','The Libertine by Todd English would be a fine name for a designer cologne, but it’s an unwieldy handle for a restaurant. Let’s hope this style of nomenclature doesn’t spread, or we’ll be in for mouthfuls like Jean Georges by Jean-Georges Vongerichten and Per Se: A Thomas Keller Joint.The Libertine is the restaurant of Gild Hall, a new hotel in the financial district that tries to put out a youthful vibe. Its Web site drops brand names faster than a “Gossip Girl” novel: this place wants you to know that it offers minibars stocked by Dean & DeLuca, Frette robes and Sferra linens.A chef for more than two decades, Mr. English may be gratified to know that his name carries the cultural cachet of a particularly soft duvet cover. Diners, though, might well ask if the Libertine is more than an exercise in product placement.It is. In fact, it’s a pretty good place to eat. In his homage to English pub food, Mr. English piles salt on top of fat on top of meat on top of starch. Root vegetables rule. Butter infiltrates everything. And almost everything is undeniably tasty.The bubble and squeak with a fried egg ($9) may be a rather free interpretation of the standard English hash — it’s loaded with sausage, for one thing — but it’s hard to quibble when your mouth is full. The cod half of a fish and chips appetizer ($14) is wrapped in a malty batter that would be the definition of crisp — except that the fish is upstaged by even crisper chips. Together, they make an airtight case for deep frying (if a case even needs to be made).'"

"'08-11-05,'0','She also would not say when the plane would make its first flight, which had been set to take place before the end of 2008.Ms. Leach blamed the delay on a 58-day strike by members of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace workers, which ended when the third shift of workers at Boeing’s plants returned to their jobs Sunday night.Some 27,000 Boeing workers in Washington State, Oregon and Kansas walked off the job on Sept. 6 in a dispute over job security. They voted on Saturday to end the strike after a deal was reached last week on a new contract.The walkout halted production of airplanes at Boeing and interrupted development work on the Dreamliner.Last month, Boeing executives told analysts that the company would need time to get its factories up to speed after the strike concluded.At that time, Boeing’s chief executive, W. James McNerney Jr., estimated there would be at least a “day for day impact” on Boeing’s production schedules. Given that estimate, the Dreamliner’s first test flight could take place early next year.Ms. Leach said, however, that Boeing was in the middle of an assessment of how long it would need to return to full production. She said Boeing was also mapping out a new schedule for the Dreamliner, including the new date of its first flight and when it might be shipped to customers.Those dates “will be part of the assessment, because there are so many factors involved,” Ms. Leach said.Several analysts have predicted the Dreamliner would not be delivered to customers until 2010.Meanwhile, Ms. Leach said Boeing had discovered that fasteners used throughout the Dreamliner had been incorrectly installed, and was taking steps to reinstall them properly.The problem occurred on the four test versions of the Dreamliner that have been assembled at Boeing’s factory in Everett, Wash., as well as on parts of the plane that are still at Boeing’s suppliers, Ms. Leach said.'"
"'08-11-05,'0','WASHINGTON (AP) — Factory orders dropped for a second consecutive month in September as businesses cut back on buying steel, computers and other equipment amid the economic downturn, the government said Tuesday.The Commerce Department said factory orders fell 2.5 percent from August. Analysts had expected a drop of 0.7 percent. That was on top of a revised 4.3 percent decline in August.Excluding autos and aircraft, orders fell 3.7 percent, the steepest drop since 1992, when the department began tracking sector-specific changes.Orders for nonmilitary capital goods excluding aircraft, considered a good indication of business investment plans, fell 1.5 percent. That comes after a 2.3 percent drop in August and indicates companies are cutting back on investments, probably because of the economic downturn and difficulty getting credit.The Commerce Department said last week that the economy contracted at an annual rate of 0.3 percent in the third quarter. Consumer spending fell 3.1 percent in the quarter, its first decline in 17 years and the steepest fall since 1980.Businesses also cut back, reducing their spending on equipment at a 5.5 percent pace. Orders for autos and auto parts recovered somewhat, increasing 2.7 percent, after plummeting 10.6 percent in August, the department said.'"
"'08-11-05,'0','Apple Inc. said Tuesday that it planned to hire a high-ranking I.B.M. technology executive to run its iPod and iPhone hardware engineering groups.I.B.M., the giant computer maker, filed suit last week against the executive, Mark Papermaster, the manager in charge of the company’s blade server business. I.B.M said Mr. Papermaster had signed an agreement that would prevent him from accepting a job with a competitor until one year after leaving the company.The executive whom Mr. Papermaster is replacing, Tony Fadell, senior vice president for the company’s iPod division, will stay at Apple in an advisory role to Steven P. Jobs, the chief executive.Mr. Fadell played an important role in building the company’s dominant iPod business and more recently the iPhone. Apple said last month that it had sold more than 6.9 million iPhones in the most recent quarter, surpassing Research in Motion, the dominant maker of smartphones.Because Mr. Papermaster will have a more limited role as senior vice president for devices hardware engineering, Apple may believe that it will be able to defeat the I.B.M. lawsuit easily. Apple also has a small business selling a server version of its computer systems that is aimed at corporate applications.But Apple may also be interested in Mr. Papermaster’s processor design expertise. This year Apple bought PA Semi Inc., a small microprocessor design firm that was developing microprocessors based on the I.B.M. Power design. At the time Mr. Jobs said Apple would use that expertise to design hardware for its iPhones and iPods.'"
"'08-11-05,'0','NEW YORK (AP) — The Archer Daniels Midland Company said on Tuesday that its quarterly earnings more than doubled, beating Wall Street estimates as it benefited from lower commodity prices and higher selling prices.The company, which processes foods and produces ethanol, said profit in the period rose to $1.05 billion, or $1.63 a share, from $441 million, or 68 cents a share, a year earlier.The result beat the 69 cents a share expected by analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters.Sales in the period, which ended Sept. 30 and was the first quarter of the company’s fiscal year, rose 65 percent, to $21.16 billion, from $12.83 billion, easily surpassing Wall Street’s estimate of $15.98 billion. The gain came mostly from higher average selling prices, which Archer Daniels said arose from increases in underlying commodity costs.Operating profit at the company’s corn-processing unit fell by more than half because of higher corn prices and energy costs. That was more than offset by the oilseeds-processing unit, where the company realized higher selling prices because it was one of the few suppliers of soybean crush when the harvest was delayed.'"
"'08-11-05,'0','“Calling the Ph.D. degree a piece of torn paper was insulting,” Mr. Ahmadi added. “It looks like Mr. Ahmadinejad could become lonely and lose his supporters as we move closer to the elections.”The dismissal was broadcast live on radio, as lawmakers accused Mr. Kordan of lying and dishonesty. Mr. Kordan, who became interior minister in August, defended himself by saying that he believed his 30-year record of service to Iran was more valuable than a degree. In an impassioned speech, he said the accusations had sickened his wife, made his son too embarrassed to go to a university and forced his daughter to leave town. One of Mr. Kordan’s opponents in Parliament, Dariush Ghanbari, said the impeachment vote was a sign of Parliament’s will to oppose deception.After Parliament approved Mr. Kordan’s appointment as interior minister, a member posted on his Web site a letter from Oxford saying that it had never given an honorary doctorate to Mr. KordanA parliamentary investigation found not only that Mr. Kordan’s Ph.D. was a fake, but also that he did not have the bachelor’s and master’s degrees from an Iranian university he had claimed. “Dismissing Mr. Kordan is not dismissing an individual, but is opposing the kind of deceptive mentality that pretends to be moral and religious but deep inside is involved in all sorts of corruption,” Mr. Ghanbari said.The developments are a further setback for Mr. Ahmadinejad because he will have to get a vote of confidence on his entire 21-member cabinet if one more minister is fired. According to the Constitution, if more than half of the cabinet members are dismissed, all members must face a confidence vote. Mr. Ahmadinejad has dismissed nine ministers in the past three years because they disagreed with his policies.The removal of the interior minister, who is responsible for holding the presidential election, comes at a difficult time for Mr. Ahmadinejad.The former interior minister, Mostafa Pourmohammadi, who was dismissed in April, told Parliament that Mr. Ahmadinejad had withdrawn money illegally from the foreign exchange reserve fund. He said more money should be in the fund than the $25 billion that the president had announced, the daily newspaper Etemad Melli reported Tuesday.Parliament also plans to investigate Mr. Ahmadinejad’s provincial trips, newspapers reported Monday. He visited all of Iran’s 30 provinces and started a second round of trips. His opponents say that the trips have cost a huge amount of money and that he has not delivered on any of his promises. They accuse him of using the trips to increase his popularity for the election.'"
"'08-11-05,'0','“We don’t know if it’s the end of the bear market yet, but it looks as though the bear has taken a nap,” said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at Standard & Poor’s equity research. “So investors are thinking, let’s enjoy a bit of a relief, both from the market’s lows and from the endless pre-election rhetoric.”Other analysts said they believed the election had only a peripheral effect on the market, as there had been no major surprises. More important to the rally, they said, was a continuing round of coordinated interest rate cuts worldwide, a further thaw in the credit markets and the increasing resiliency of the markets to the daily drumbeat of bad economic news. The extreme volatility of recent weeks has calmed, though trading volume remained light.The Chicago Board Options Exchange’s volatility index dipped below 50 for the first time since Oct. 14. The Dow Jones industrial average has rallied 18 percent since the close on Oct. 27, including the 10.9 percent gain on Oct. 28.“Investors are starting to look ahead of some of these numbers to 2009, and they are starting to see a bit of recovery,” said Ryan Larson, head equity trader at Voyageur Asset Management. “Some of the volatility is coming out of the marketplace.”The markets showed little reaction as the government reported that new orders for manufactured goods in September dropped $11.2 billion, or 2.5 percent, to $432 billion, a larger-than-expected decline. That came after a 4.3 percent decrease in August.It was the second negative manufacturing report in two days. On Monday, the Institute for Supply Management’s index of manufacturing activity in the United States fell to 38.9 in October, from 43.5 in September, the worst reading since September 1982. The markets also seemed to take that news in stride, spending the day trading in a narrow range before eventually ending the day flat.The rally that unfolded on Wall Street was broad-based. All industry sectors in the S.& P. index rose, led by energy stocks. Among the 30 blue-chip stocks that make up the Dow, General Electric, Verizon Communications and Caterpillar were among the strongest performers.The stock exchange first opened for trading on Election Day in 1984. That year, the Dow rose 1.2 percent, a gain not topped since, as Ronald Reagan was re-elected.Shares of MasterCard, the world’s second-biggest credit card company after Visa, jumped 18 percent, to $170.24, after the company said that higher overseas revenue had helped bolster profit.Still, the company warned that the economic slowdown would affect profit in the near term.Building on a trend from the last several days, the credit markets eased further on Tuesday, with interbank and corporate borrowing rates declining significantly. The London interbank offered rate, or Libor, a benchmark that banks charge one another, fell to 0.375 percent.The Treasury’s 10-year bill rose 1 17/32, to 102 7/32. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, was 3.72 percent, down from 3.91 percent late Monday.Stock markets were also higher in Europe and Asia. The Dow Jones Euro Stoxx 50 index, a barometer of euro zone blue chips, rose 5.56 percent, while the FTSE 100 index in London jumped 4.42 percent. The CAC 40 in Paris gained 4.62 percent, and the DAX in Frankfurt was up 5 percent.In Tokyo, the Nikkei 225 stock index rose 2.8 percent on Wednesday morning, buoyed by a softer yen and the rally in the American markets.In Sydney, the S.& P./ASX 200 index was 1.9 percent higher on Wednesday morning. The Australian central bank surprised the markets on Tuesday with a larger-than-expected interest rate cut. The bank cut its main interest rate target by three-quarters of a percentage point, to 5.25 percent, rather than by the half-point that had been widely expected.Following are the results of Tuesday’s Treasury auction of 238-day cash management bills and four-week bills:'"
"'08-11-05,'0','BARLEY has always been the one-trick pony of my pantry. I’d trot it out whenever the urge for mushroom-barley soup struck, then neglect it for months. Sometimes, I’d contemplate barley risotto or barley salad as I dusted off the package, vowing to make more frequent use of it. But when all the soup was gone, I’d forget about barley, choosing sexier fare like arborio rice and farro.Recently, though, memories of my grandmother’s kosher cooking and a dearth of “exotic” mushrooms at the farmers’ market made me branch out.My current recipe for mushroom-barley soup is loaded with unusual mushrooms, like oysters and maitakes, which gives it a meatier, richer flavor than the white button mushroom-barley soup of my childhood.But when I arrived at the market, the mushroom man was packing up his stand, not even a tiny enoki left. Without fancy mushrooms, my soup-making urge dwindled to zero, even though I’d already unearthed the barley from the back of the cupboard.It was exactly the kick-start I needed to try something new.I thought back to the first mushroom-barley soup I ever had, at a dairy restaurant in Brooklyn with my grandmother Ella. It was as thick as oatmeal and filled with plump nuggets of salty barley as slippery as tapioca; I loved the starchy texture even more than the flavor.'"

"'08-11-06,'0','And here in the United States, an 8-year-old boy announced on Wednesday morning his new career goal: He will be America’s first Latino president.The outpouring suggests that the United States will enjoy an Obama dividend of global good will in the coming months, a chance to hammer out progress on common threats. “Barack” means blessing in Swahili, and this election feels like America’s great chance to rejoin the world after eight years of self-exile.Mr. Obama’s election may also be a political milestone, ending an era in which Republicans succeeded at winning votes from the working poor to cut taxes for billionaires. That was the ’s great success over the last 40 years. Blue-collar Americans regularly voted like stockbrokers because they felt more at home with Republican traditional values.Mr. Obama chipped away at this values divide, and that’s why the United States will have its first Democratic president since John Kennedy who isn’t from the South. Mr. Obama just may be able to stitch together a Democratic majority for years to come.Still, Mr. Obama will soon have to prove himself. Remember that when became the British prime minister last year, he was beloved for his reserve and cool competence — a demeanor a bit like Mr. Obama’s, though without the eloquence. Within a few months, voters were calling for Mr. Brown’s head.One of Mr. Obama’s challenges will be to harness the extraordinary idealism that he inspired in his campaign to a larger, national cause. My 11-year-old daughter toiled with her friends this fall to sell lemonade and to raise money for Mr. Obama’s campaign, all on their own initiative. On Election Day, my daughter was still selling Obama buttons in the street, and on election night, she flagrantly defied her bedtime rules to celebrate as history unfolded. Now she’s ready to drop out of school — who needs algebra? — and become a community organizer.The obvious way to institutionalize that kind of excitement is a national service program, not only for young people but also for graying baby boomers considering “encore careers.”Whatever the next step, it’s worth savoring this historic vista. First, look backward at a long-forgotten horror. In 1958, a little white girl in innocently kissed a 9-year-old black friend named Hanover on the cheek. The police arrested the boy, along with his 7-year-old companion, and a court sentenced him to 12 years imprisonment for attempted . (After publicity, the boy was eventually released.)Considering that past, perhaps the most incisive comment on Mr. Obama’s election actually came long ago. The Rev. Dr. addressed the Legislature in 1959, two years before Mr. Obama was born in , and declared that the civil rights movement aimed not just to free blacks but “to free the soul of America.”Mr. King ended his Hawaii speech by quoting a prayer from a preacher who had once been a slave, and it’s an apt description of the idea of America today: “Lord, we ain’t what we want to be; we ain’t what we ought to be; we ain’t what we gonna be, but, thank God, we ain’t what we was.”'"
"'08-11-06,'0','Domenico Leccisi, a right-wing Italian politician who became known as “the Body Snatcher” in 1946 when he and two followers stole the corpse of the fascist dictator Mussolini from a pauper’s grave, died Sunday at a retirement home in Milan. He was 88.The cause was heart and respiratory disease, his son, Gabrielle, told The Associated Press.As German forces retreated from Italy in the closing days of the European campaign of World War II, Mussolini and his mistress, Claretta Petacci, fled north with them, only to be captured and, on April 28, 1945, executed by Communist partisans near Lake Como. The next day their bodies were taken to Milan and hanged, heads downward, at a gas station on Piazza Loreto. That night, at the insistence of the Allied authorities, the bodies were removed and buried in an unmarked grave at the Musocco Cemetery in Milan.In early 1946, Mr. Leccisi and his followers entered the cemetery one night and stole Mussolini’s body. Somehow during the enterprise, they lost one of the dictator’s legs. Several months later the police traced the body to a Franciscan monastery in Pavia and began a nationwide hunt for the thieves.Mr. Leccisi was arrested and sentenced to six years in prison for stealing the body, but he was soon released under an amnesty for certain Fascist-era crimes.Mussolini’s remains were taken to a Capuchin monastery 15 miles northwest of Milan and kept there, in secret, for 11 years. The authorities feared that die-hard fascists would come to commemorate Mussolini if they knew where he was buried.'"
"'08-11-06,'0','The tensions and their increasingly public airing provide a revealing coda to the ill-fated McCain-Palin ticket, hinting at the mounting turmoil of a campaign that was described even by many Republicans as incoherent, negative and badly run.For her part, Ms. Palin told reporters in Arizona on Wednesday morning that “there is absolutely no diva in me.”Later in the day, she refused to address the strife within the campaigns. “I have absolutely no intention of engaging in any of the negativity because this has been all positive for me,” she said, adding that it was time to savor President-elect Barack Obama’s victory and “not let the pettiness or maybe internal workings of a campaign erode any of the recognition of this historic moment.”As the ticketmate with a potentially brighter political future, Ms. Palin has more at stake going forward than Mr. McCain, whose aides now have an interest in blaming outside factors for their loss, making Ms. Palin a tempting target. And even as the votes from the election were still being counted, there were new recriminations, with Mr. McCain’s aides suggesting that a Palin aide had leaked damaging information about them to reporters.The tensions were described in interviews with top aides to the two campaigns who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they did not want to be seen as disloyal to Mr. McCain’s effort at a difficult time.Finger-pointing at the end of a losing campaign is traditional and to a large degree predictable, as Mr. McCain himself acknowledged in a prescient interview in July.“Every book I’ve read about a campaign is that the one that won, it was a perfect and beautifully run campaign with geniuses running it and incredible messaging, et cetera,” Mr. McCain said then. “And always the one that lost, ‘Oh, completely screwed up, too much infighting, bad people, etcetera.’ So if I win, I believe that historians will say, ‘Way to go, he fine-tuned that campaign, and he got the right people in the right place and as the campaign grew, he gave them more responsibility.’ If I lose,” people will say, “ ‘That campaign, always in disarray.’ ”The disputes between the campaigns centered in large part on the Republican National Committee’s $150,000 wardrobe for Ms. Palin and her family, but also on what McCain advisers considered Ms. Palin’s lack of preparation for her disastrous interview with Katie Couric of CBS News and her refusal to take advice from Mr. McCain’s campaign.But behind those episodes may be a greater subtext: anger within the McCain camp that Ms. Palin harbored political ambitions beyond 2008.As late as Tuesday night, a McCain adviser said, Ms. Palin was pushing to deliver her own speech just before Mr. McCain’s concession speech, even though vice-presidential nominees do not traditionally speak on election night. But Ms. Palin met up with Mr. McCain with text in hand. She was told no by Mark Salter, one of Mr. McCain’s closest advisers, and Steve Schmidt, Mr. McCain’s top strategist.On Wednesday, two top McCain campaign advisers said that the clothing purchases for Ms. Palin and her family were a particular source of outrage for them. As they portrayed it, Ms. Palin had been advised by Nicolle Wallace, a senior McCain aide, that she should buy three new suits for the Republican National Convention in St. Paul in September and three additional suits for the fall campaign. The budget for the clothes was anticipated to be from $20,000 to $25,000, the officials said.Instead, in a public relations debacle undermining Ms. Palin’s image as an everywoman “hockey mom,” bills came in to the Republican National Committee for about $150,000, including charges of $75,062 at Neiman Marcus and $49,425 at Saks Fifth Avenue. The bills included clothing for Ms. Palin’s family and purchases of shoes, luggage and jewelry, the advisers said.The advisers described the McCain campaign as incredulous about the shopping spree and said Republican National Committee lawyers were likely to go to Alaska to conduct an inventory and try to account for all that was spent.Ms. Palin has defended her wardrobe as the idea of the Republican National Committee and said that she would give it back.“Those clothes, they are not my property,” she said. “Just like the lighting and the staging and everything else that the R.N.C. purchased.”Advisers in the McCain campaign, in suggesting that Palin advisers had been leaking damaging information about the McCain campaign to the news media, said they were particularly suspicious of Randy Scheunemann, Mr. McCain’s top foreign policy aide who had a central role in preparing Ms. Palin for the vice-presidential debate.As a result, two senior members of the McCain campaign said on Wednesday that Mr. Scheunemann had been fired from the campaign in its final days. But Rick Davis, the McCain campaign manager, and Mr. Salter, one of Mr. McCain’s closest advisers, said Wednesday that Mr. Scheunemann had in fact not been dismissed. Mr. Scheunemann, who picked up the phone in his office at McCain campaign headquarters on Wednesday afternoon, responded that “anybody who says I was fired is either lying or delusional or a whack job.”Mr. Scheunemann was referring to widely disseminated criticism by Mr. McCain’s advisers in the final days of the campaign that Ms. Palin, as first reported in Politico, was a “whack job.”Whatever the permutations, the advisers said they strongly believed that Mr. Scheunemann was disclosing, as one put it, “a constant stream of poison” to William Kristol, the editor of the conservative Weekly Standard and a columnist for The New York Times.Mr. Kristol, who wrote a column on Oct. 13 calling on Mr. McCain to fire his campaign because it was “close to being out-and-out dysfunctional,” said in a telephone interview on Wednesday that the campaign advisers were paranoid. Mr. Kristol has been a strong supporter of Ms. Palin.“I wasn’t writing poison,” Mr. Kristol said. He added: “Randy Scheunemann is a friend of mine and I think he did a good job. I talked to him, but I talked to a lot of people at the campaign.”The McCain camp was further upset about Ms. Palin’s interview with Ms. Couric, which was broadcast at a time when Ms. Palin was meeting with foreign leaders at the United Nations and trying to establish some foreign policy credentials. Ms. Palin’s wobbly and tongue-tied performance was mocked in an iconic impersonation on “Saturday Night Live” by Tina Fey.Ms. Palin, who had prepared for and survived an initial interview with Charles Gibson of ABC News, did not have the time or focus to prepare for Ms. Couric, the McCain advisers said. “She did not say, ‘I will not prepare,’ ” a McCain adviser said. “She just didn’t have a bandwidth to do a mock interview session the way we had prepared before. She was just overloaded.”One of the last straws for the McCain advisers came just days before the election when news broke that Ms. Palin had taken a call made by Marc-Antoine Audette. Mr. Audette and his fellow comedian Sebastien Trudel are notorious for prank calls to celebrities and heads of state.Ms. Palin appeared to believe that she was talking to President Nicolas Sarkozy of France, even though the prankster had a flamboyant French accent and spoke to her in a more personal way than would be protocol in such a call. At one point, he told Ms. Palin that she would make a good president some day. “Maybe in eight years,” she replied.'"
"'08-11-06,'0','Out of 30 items for which prices were requested, 21 were not available at the stores at which they were listed.Two editors at different fashion publications, who would not speak publicly because they did not want to embarrass their employers, said “price upon request” was usually a misnomer. It has become a euphemism used to credit designs that were never produced for sale. It is appearing more commonly, they said, for a clear reason: less and less runway fashion is actually being produced.Retailers are now buying more heavily from designers’ preseason collections. Though preseason clothes are often less eye-catching and trendy than the runway collections, they arrive sooner and typically sell better. But magazine editors still want to show the sexier stuff. It is not surprising, then, that readers have noticed a disconnect between what is promoted in magazines and what appears in stores, and wonder if “price upon request” is out of control.“If you can’t say what it is, because it’s actually nonexistent, why bother showing it?” said Debi Greenberg, the owner and buyer for Louis Boston. “That is very alienating to me and, I’m sure, to a lot of people. They are showing a lot of buffoonery that is so over the top that readers are saying to themselves: ‘Are they actually telling me this is what I should be wearing? And they don’t even put a price on it?’ ”But magazines are not catalogs. Erin Kaplan, a spokeswoman for Elle, said that its editors often photograph collections within days of the runway shows and that the designers give the most accurate pricing information available at the time. That may include stores where a designer’s collection is carried, if not the featured item.“We say ‘price upon request’ when an item isn’t produced because the designer will make the item at cost, if they decide to, depending on interest,” she said.There were only a handful of items in recent issues of Vogue without clear prices, but that is because the magazine has a policy to always publish the price, with the exception of couture and some special items.It may seem strange that stores would want customers directed to merchandise they do not possess. Agatha Szczepaniak, a spokeswoman for Betsey Johnson, said that the full-page photograph of the red jacket in Bazaar had resulted in almost daily customer inquiries at the stores. “It’s very positive in that we get calls from people of all different sorts, from the affluent to the fashion forward,” she said. In that case, the price of the jacket wasn’t available before the magazine went to print.Some stores that were contacted had the magazines, and the answers, on hand. A salesman at Alexander McQueen knew that the price of a custom-made cape worn by the actress Emma Watson in Bazaar was $60,000 and that it could be made in other colors. A Fendi mink bag with a snowflake motif was ready and waiting at the store for $9,500. But others were more difficult: A customer-service representative at the number listed for the Dolce & Gabbana herringbone gown in the October issues of Vogue and Bazaar did not return calls, but a spokeswoman at the brand’s corporate headquarters (someone who would not be accessible to the public) said the dress was $35,165. To get the price of the Van Cleef & Arpels necklace, a caller had to give his full name and identify himself as either a news media member or a potential client before the details were revealed.Elle’s policy is especially confusing. Items from Chanel’s new fine-jewelry collection are listed as “price upon request” on the pages where they appear, but flip to a shopping guide in the back and there they are, like the answers to a crossword puzzle: $136,000 to $610,000.It is not entirely clear what readers are to make of other images, like one in the November Bazaar that shows a Giorgio Armani jacket for $6,195 with a barely visible skirt, and directs the reader to the Armani store in New York. A salesman there was at a loss to guess which skirt it could be. Or in the winter fashion issue of T: The New York Times Style Magazine, in which the “price on request” sweater worn by Carla Bruni is credited to MaxMara. The photograph is a head shot; Ms. Bruni could have been wearing a bikini.Perhaps the oddest example appears in the October Bazaar, which includes a page dedicated to a $1,345 coat, also from MaxMara, with detachable parts that are priced separately — a fur collar is $315, a cuff is $360, the magazine noted, but an extendable sleeve is “price upon request.”It turns out that if you buy the $1,345 coat, MaxMara will throw in the sleeves free.'"
"'08-11-06,'0','In the case of the Lawrence property, Christie’s had given the estate a guarantee — an undisclosed sum regardless of the outcome of the sale — so the auction house could set its own reserves (that is, the undisclosed minimum prices that bidders must meet for the art to be sold). Even after those reserves were lowered, the audience barely bit.The two collections brought a total of $47 million, less than half of its $104 million low estimate. Of the 58 lots, 17 failed to sell. (Final prices include the commission to Christie’s: 25 percent of the first $50,000, 20 percent of the next $50,000 to $1 million, and 12 percent of the rest. Estimates do not reflect commissions.)Of the 30 works from the Lawrence collection, the highlight was expected to be “No. 43 (Mauve),” a classic 1960 Rothko painting. The dark abstract canvas was estimated at $20 million to $30 million, far beyond the $1.5 million the couple paid for it at Sotheby’s in 1988. Mr. Burge opened the bidding at $10 million, but he had no takers. (Before the auction, experts grumbled that the painting had condition issues.)Other casualties were a 1970 abstract drawing by de Kooning, estimated at $500,000 to $700,000, and a 1964 crushed metal sculpture by John Chamberlain, estimated at $900,000 to $1.2 million.One of the few works that several people were willing to reach for was Magritte’s “Empire of the Lights” (1947), a gouache of one of the artist’s most famous images — a nocturnal street scene featuring a spookily shuttered house and a brilliant blue sky with puffy white clouds. David Benrimon, a New York dealer, bought the work for $3.1 million ($3.5 million including Christie’s fees), just above its high estimate of $3 million.Anything connected with Francis Bacon has been a hit at auction in recent years, and Christie’s was selling a portrait of George Dyer, Bacon’s companion, who committed suicide in 1971. The image was painted by Lucian Freud in 1966. The salesroom perked up when three bidders tried for the painting, which ended up bringing its low estimate of $1.8 million, or $2 million with Christie’s commission.The evening began with 28 paintings and works on paper from the Hillman collection. In the hope of warming up the audience, Christie’s had choreographed the sale so that several lower-priced drawings went on the block first. But that did not help. Early on, a Cézanne watercolor landscape from 1904-6, “The Cathedral at Aix From the Studio at Les Lauves,” was expected to bring $4 million to $6 million. It failed to sell. One bottom-feeder was willing to pay $2.8 million.One work that sold for about its low estimate was Léger’s “Study for a Nude Model in the Studio,” an oil and gouache on paper from 1912. It not only was a study for a painting he completed the following year but also prefigured his iconic series “Contrast of Forms.” The black-and-white work of curves and angles sold to a telephone bidder for $2.9 million, or $3.3 million with fees, right at its low estimate.The evening’s most expensive work turned out to be De Chirico’s “Metaphysical Composition,” from the Hillman collection, a 1914 oil on canvas in which a bizarre assemblage of objects like a foot and an egg form a still life in an outdoor setting. The painting has a particularly distinguished past: it initially belonged to the artist’s dealer, Paul Guillaume, and after his death was owned by a succession of writers and artists including Paul Éluard. The painting had three bidders, and it sold to an unidentified telephone bidder for $5.4 million, or $6.1 million with Christie’s fees, just above its $6 million low estimate.More expensive works had no takers, including Manet’s “Young Girl on a Bench,” an 1880 portrait of a girl with a wide-brim hat that was expected to bring $12 million to $18 million.There were bargains to be had. An 1897 portrait by Toulouse-Lautrec of Henri Nocq, a Belgian artist and craftsman, showing him in his studio in front of a painting, was priced at $6 million to $9 million. A lone telephone bidder was able to get it for $3.9 million, or $4.4 million with Christie’s commission.After the sale, many people criticized Christie’s for trying too hard to market what were not perceived as great collections. The auction house had printed separate hardbound catalogs for each collection and several promotional brochures trumpeting the sale. “It was all down to packaging,” Mr. Roundell said. “It was mutton dressed as lamb.”'"
"'08-11-06,'0','Three of the four holdouts are Latino legislators who feel Latinos have been underrepresented in leadership roles in city and state government and want to press the issue in the Senate.Mr. Díaz said the four men, who have formed an independent political caucus, may put off making a decision on whom to back for leader until the new legislative session begins in January.“There’s a concern that we have a black president, a black governor and we have a concern that we have to be sharing power,” said Mr. Díaz.The development was the latest dizzying spin in a year in which a Democratic governor resigned after being implicated in a prostitution scandal and a Republican Senate leader stepped down amid a continuing federal corruption investigation.In a sign of party leaders’ concern, Gov. David A. Paterson met with the four men Wednesday morning to urge them to back Mr. Smith, arguing that they were standing in the way of a historic opportunity for their party. The Democrats have not had control of the state Senate in nearly a half century and have not held both the governorship and the Legislature since the New Deal.A staff member for one of the four senators said the group’s “key concern was the absence of Latino leadership among the state’s key leadership posts” and said the group would go so far as push to install a Latino majority leader — a move that would be a heavy political lift for four senators to achieve.Other people who have spoken to members of the group downplayed the suggestion that one of the four would insist on the top leadership post but said they might seek other roles.Mr. Monserrate said in a statement that “we must continue to fight for representation for our diverse communities,” adding, “our community does not have a single state or citywide elected leader in any legislative body.”The Democrats that did show up for the meeting in Albany tried to present a unified front and downplayed the possibility of defections. Mr. Smith said he was “very proud” that some of his members had formed an independent caucus.“We have an upstate caucus, we have a women’s caucus, we have a council of black senators, we have a suburban caucus. Now we have an independent caucus,” he said.During the closed-door meeting, Senator Jeffrey D. Klein of the Bronx called for a vote of confidence for Mr. Smith; it passed unanimously. Mr. Klein had been widely seen as jockeying for the leadership job himself. When the Democrats emerged as a group from their meeting and reporters asked whether Mr. Smith would remain leader, several senators shouted “Yes!” and broke into applause.But Juda Engelmayer, a spokesman for the independent caucus, said Mr. Smith “will only have 28 votes and will not have the 32 he needs.”The leadership impasse comes as the state faces a dire fiscal outlook. The governor has called lawmakers back to Albany on Nov. 18 for a special session to close a $1.5 billion budget gap in the current budget. The governor will now have to negotiate amid leadership turmoil and with Republicans, still in control of the Senate for now, in no mood to compromise.Mr. Díaz said he might stay neutral in a leadership race, but the Republicans may not have a hard time swaying the dissident Democrats. Mr. Espada switched party affiliations and ran on the Republican line in 2002. Mr. Kruger has been so friendly with Senate Republicans that they appointed him a committee chairman.Mr. Díaz, a Pentecostal minister, has long been one of the most socially conservative voices in the Senate. He continued to say on Wednesday that he could not support as leader any lawmaker who would help make gay marriage become law, even if it were his own son, Assemblyman Ruben Díaz Jr.“I would not support anybody, Malcolm Smith, my son Ruben Díaz Jr., anybody who supports that,” he said.Mr. Smith has indicated he would allow a vote on same-sex marriage, but he and other senators attempted to downplay the issue Wednesday.Senator Thomas K. Duane, an openly gay Democrat from Manhattan who has been a major advocate for marriage legislation, said, “We’re putting everything on hold until we fix the economy.”It was not immediately clear how the Republicans, who are still regrouping after their electoral defeats, will bargain with the four renegade Democrats. The four do not appear to be considering switching their party registration to become Republicans, but could be open to supporting a Republican for majority leader.Senator Thomas W. Libous, a Binghamton Republican and deputy majority leader, said “The four of them are going to be a pretty powerful voice at this point.”But other Republicans were skeptical of a power-sharing arrangement.“Obviously I don’t want to lose all of our power, so I would welcome their support,” said Senator George H. Winner Jr., a Republican from Elmira. He added that keeping all four in line with Republicans could prove difficult.“It’s just a very radical type of governing that’s not something that’s ever happened in Albany, so I just don’t know how it works,” he added.In addition, if the four Democrats side with Republicans in a leadership battle, they could face intense political backlash. Olga A. Mendez, a former Harlem Democratic senator, lost in the 2004 election after she became a Republican.The uncertainty over Senate control rocked the state’s political establishment Wednesday. Many expected a newly energized Democratic party to pursue a more activist agenda in Albany. Now that agenda is less certain. . Barbara Bartoletti, legislative director of the League of Women Voters in New York State, said in an interview earlier this week that if the Democrats took control of the Senate, “A lot of bills that have been held up will certainly be on the fast track.”Besides gay marriage, those bills would likely include measures to strengthen abortion rights on the state level, should Roe v. Wade be overturned by the United States Supreme Court, and the so-called bottle bill, which would extend 5-cent deposits to plastic water bottles.'"
"'08-11-06,'0','OTTAWA — Jean Charest, the premier of Quebec, announced an early election for the province on Wednesday, less than a month after a federal election in Canada.But even before the campaign officially began, one issue was clear: Quebec’s separation from Canada will not be a major theme of any platform. After being pushed into third place during the last election, in March 2007, the separatist Parti Québécois and its new leader, Pauline Marois, have said that they are in no rush to introduce another referendum on the issue.Mr. Charest hopes the election, set for Dec. 8, will bring his Liberal Party a majority in the provincial legislature.Beginning a campaign during a period of global economic uncertainty might appear to be a political gamble. But Mr. Charest said the province’s best hope would be ending its minority government situation, which has required his party to alter bills to attract opposition votes.“We need political stability for economic prosperity,” Mr. Charest said at a news conference at a scenic outlook above the St. Lawrence River in Quebec City. “We can’t face an economic storm with three different pairs of hands on the rudder of our ship.”'"
"'08-11-06,'0','In documents filed in bankruptcy court in the Eastern District of New York, Agriprocessors, whose headquarters is in Brooklyn, reported annual earnings of $300 million before the raid, the first revenue figures made public for the privately owned company. It reported debt of $50 million to $100 million.Blaming “difficult circumstances involving a raid” for its financial woes, Agriprocessors, which filed under Chapter 11 of the bankruptcy code, said it was seeking new financing to restructure its business. It opted to declare bankruptcy after its major creditor, First Bank Business Capital of Missouri, foreclosed last week on a $35 million loan. The foreclosure is suspended while the bankruptcy proceeds.“We are filing this to reinvigorate the company,” said Agriprocessors’s lawyer in the bankruptcy, Kevin J. Nash.In Postville, a town of 2,200 in northeastern Iowa, residents said there was an unfamiliar calm on Wednesday as activity at the big plant at the edge of town fell to a low. Long before the raid, the Rubashkins had clashed with residents in Postville, where low pay, unpaid overtime and safety violations at the plant were a frequent subject of local gossip. But residents were deeply worried at the prospect that their largest employer by far would close.“I think that people would prefer a different owner,” said the Rev. Paul Ouderkirk, the priest at St. Bridget’s Catholic Church in Postville, which has been supporting the families of dozens of immigrants arrested in the raid. “But it would be very, very tragic if the plant shut down.”While Agriprocessors blamed the raid for its bankruptcy filing, Iowa labor experts said the company created many of its own troubles by hiring large numbers of illegal immigrants and paying them wages far below the industry standard, and by maintaining contentious relations with state labor authorities and fiercely resisting unions.“They left themselves exposed by their utter refusal to play by the rules,” said Mark Grey, a sociology professor at the University of Northern Iowa who studies recent immigration to Iowa.Union officials said the Postville plant stood out from other Iowa packinghouses for the frequency of its labor violations.“If there was a hall of shame for employers in this industry, Agriprocessors would have its own wing,” said Mark Lauritsen, international vice president of the United Food and Commercial Workers, a union that has long tried to gain a foothold at the plant.Demand for Agriprocessors’s brands began to decline after the company’s labor practices were criticized by a movement of Conservative and Reform Jews, who are seeking to add a new seal, known as Hekhsher Tzedek, to kosher-certified food. It would signify it was produced according to Jewish ethics.Religious authorities at the Orthodox Union, the country’s major certifier of kosher food, said they were working with the top manager at Agriprocessors, Bernard S. Feldman, to find new owners or managers for the company. Mr. Feldman took charge of the company in late September.If the Postville plant closes, it would leave “a significant void in the market that cannot easily be reproduced,” said Rabbi Menachem Genack, the chief executive of the kosher-certifying arm of the Orthodox Union.Sholom Rubashkin, the former chief executive of Agriprocessors, was arrested last week by federal authorities on charges of conspiracy to harbor illegal immigrants. Sholom and Aaron Rubashkin were also facing state criminal charges in Iowa for employing more than 30 under-age workers at the plant, and Iowa labor authorities have levied $10 million in fines for wage violations.In Postville, residents were dismayed by a report posted on a Jewish Web site, FailedMessiah.com, saying that Sholom Rubashkin held a celebration in Postville last week after he was released from detention on $1 million bail.About 300 illegal immigrant workers, most of them from Guatemala, were convicted on federal charges after the raid. Most served five months in prison and were deported.'"
"'08-11-06,'0','During a visit to the home of the photographer Julius Shulman a few years ago, Benedikt Taschen, the founder of the art book company Taschen, made a tremendous discovery: a nearly intact collection of Arts & Architecture magazines from the 1940s, ’50s and ’60s, championing the emerging Modernist architecture of Southern California. Today, design from the post World War II-period is legendary, but it was John Entenza, the magazine’s editor, who first published the likes of Frank Gehry and Richard Meier, and whose Case Study House Program raised awareness of how designers were using new technologies and materials. Now, Taschen has created a facsimile edition of 265 issues of the magazine published in its heyday. The first installment, a 10-box set covering 1945 through 1954, goes on sale for $700 this month. The second, 1955 through 1967, will be released next fall.'"
"'08-11-06,'0','Or you could wait for Washington. “I’ve had it with the high decibel sound of advertising. They just blow you out of the room,” says Anna Eshoo, a representative of California, who in June introduced the Commercial Advertisement Loudness Mitigation (CALM) Act, which aims to require the Federal Communications Commission to create a standard that would bar commercials from being broadcast at louder volumes than the accompanying program.“It is the second highest complaint the F.C.C. receives,” she said. The F.C.C. said it had received 186 such complaints this year. “It really bothers people. Is it up there with the war in Iraq or people losing their health care? No, but this is something I’m going to pursue.”Of course, the real trick is to eliminate commercials entirely. To do that, you’ll need a digital video recorder, like TiVo or one supplied by your cable company.According to the United States Postal Service, American households receive 100.5 billion pieces of junk mail, or 868 pieces for each household, each year. To stop the solicitors, get your name off their registries. Unfortunately, there is no single registry that will remove you from all unwanted mailers, but here are some places to start.The Direct Marketing Association, established in 1917, last month began an opt-out tool called DMA Choice (dmachoice.org). Instead of an all-or-nothing system, DMA Choice lets consumers opt out (or in) of four categories (magazines, catalogs, credit cards, other) or by individual business. DMA Choice lets consumers opt out of mailings for three years at a time.OptOutPrescreen.com is another opt-out service, but instead of multiple categories, it removes your name only from lists that are used to send preapproved or prescreened offers of credit or insurance. The service, run by the consumer credit reporting companies (Equifax, Experian, Innovis and TransUnion), lets you opt out for five years or permanently. You can also opt-out by phone: 1-888-5 OPT OUT.While the above services are free, you can also use paid mailer removal services like 41pounds.org. Named after the weight of junk mail the average adult receives yearly, 41pounds will contact 20 to 30 direct marketing agencies to get you off their lists. The service costs $41 for five years. GreenDimes (greendimes.com) is another paid service ($20 a year) that guarantees to stop up to 90 percent of your junk mail.Unlike with mailers, there is a national registry to block telemarketers. Managed by the Federal Trade Commission, the National Do Not Call Registry (donotcall.gov) lets you register your home and cellphones free. According to the group’s Web site, telemarketers should stop calling once your information has been on the registry for 31 days.In addition to using snail mail, e-mail has provided marketers with opportunities. Spammers will search the Internet for e-mail addresses, and they will then clog your in-box with ads for Viagra and other products.To prevent this, do not post your e-mail address online, or if you do, spell out the words “dot” and “at” instead of using their corresponding symbols so the spammers will have a more difficult time grabbing your address.Also, make sure your e-mail service has a good spam filter and that it is turned on. Some services like Gmail and Yahoo Mail have pre-enabled e-mail filtering. You can also download spam-filtering programs like MailWasher (www.mailwasher.net) and SpamAssassin (spamassassin.apache.org).If your spam filter misses a piece of spam, report it to your e-mail service so it can catch the spam if the company tries contacting you again.Of course, it’s best to avoid getting spam in the first place, so when signing up for an e-mail service, use an address that is an unusual mix of numbers and letters. For example, 63katherine63@gmail.com is more likely to avoid getting spam than katherine123@gmail.com. Alternatively, you can create a second e-mail account just for your subscriptions. You can also subscribe to an e-mail hiding service like akapost.com so recipients won’t have access to your real address.Unfortunately, Web telemarketers don’t take aim at just your e-mail account. In order to block pop-up and banner ads when surfing the Internet, download the Firefox browser from firefox.com, then download Mozilla AdBlock Plus (addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/1865). Also be sure to enable Firefox’s built-in pop-up blocker (also available on Apple’s Safari browser and Microsoft’s Internet Explorer 8) to take care of sneakier ads.And if all of the above fails, turn off your TV, shut down your desktop and pick up a book.

GoStudio from Belkin, for example, can record stereo audio directly to an iPod Classic, Nano or Video just as if the iPod were a memory card or thumb drive.The $120 device has two built-in microphones, a mono speaker and four external microphone inputs. When you insert an iPod, a recording menu appears. You can then record live audio as a voice memo, which can then be used in iTunes or any other audio-playback or editing program.The GoStudio has a few professional features including built-in gain and recording-level controls, as well as monitor controls for listening to what is being recorded live. It has two 3.5-millimeter input jacks as well as two combo jacks that support XLR and quarter-inch cables.The GoStudio, which will be available this month online and in stores, includes two AAA batteries, as well as inserts for both Classic and Nano iPods.

"'08-11-06,'0','Cisco Systems warned that a sharp drop in sales could push revenue down by as much as 10 percent.The computer networking giant, the first major technology company to report financial results that include October, when the credit crisis spread beyond financial companies, said Wednesday that its sales fell by 9 percent in the month, compared to a year earlier. Cisco expects sales for its current quarter to drop 5 to 10 percent from the $9.8 billion reported in the same period last year.“The environment has changed dramatically in the last two months,” John T. Chambers, Cisco’s chief executive, said in a conference with Wall Street analysts.At times, Mr. Chambers sounded flummoxed by the state of the economy and growing pessimism among customers. “I think we are in a little bit of uncharted waters,” he said, adding that “it is probably the second most difficult time in my career” to provide a comfortable forecast about where things are heading. Revenue dropped 15 percent in its fiscal 2002, compared with 2001 when technology spending on the Internet collapsed.The company’s executives stressed that Cisco’s experience with the boom-bust nature of technology have it well positioned to emerge from the downturn unscathed. More than 60 percent of Cisco’s top executives were around during the dot-com bust.“We have been through this four or five times,” Mr. Chambers said. “Each time we have done this we have come out in very strong financial shape.”'"
"'08-11-06,'0','One particularly useful part of the application is the “save to wish list” function. I trailed my children through a toy store this weekend and scanned the bar codes of items they liked. From here, I’ll just forward items on the list to the grandparents, or check around for better prices and shop accordingly.When I took the G1 into a Wal-Mart, I was somewhat concerned that the data signal might not reach into the store, but ShopSavvy sped along nicely. That’s not to say it worked fully as advertised, though. I scanned a bunch of electronics items, like Bluetooth headsets and iPhone docks, only to find ShopSavvy did not yet have these products in its database.ShopSavvy did help me with some bigger-ticket items, like a Canon PowerShot A640 and a Panasonic HDTV, and it scored on Jimmy Buffett’s “Scenes You Know by Heart,” a $10 music video that ShopSavvy told me I could get on Amazon for $7.98. I also read two positive reviews of the disc, which could come in handy when gift shopping.One caveat: the iPhone and other cellphones can’t run this service well, because most of the cameras embedded in cellphones have fixed focal points. The G1’s lens has an auto-focus, which allows it to discern tiny variations in the size of bar code lines. But take heart — other phones can run applications that, while less flashy, will still help you spend more wisely.In the parking lot of the same Wal-Mart shopping center, which also included a RadioShack and a Verizon Wireless store, I tried Slifter, a product-and-price database that Virgin Mobile began offering its users last month.My search for a Bluetooth headset yielded sometimes puzzling results. I tried Slifter on a Helio phone, which runs on Virgin Mobile’s network. As with AT&T and Sprint devices, the application is featured on the phone’s “deck,” a directory of Web sites chosen by the carrier. Since the carrier put them there, the implication is that they will work flawlessly on your phone.That’s the theory. I typed in my search, and the results promised a long list of available items in my vicinity. But when I selected an item and asked to view more details, the application said my “cookie settings” were wrong, and shut down. I searched vainly for the cookie settings, then gave up and tried Slifter on my iPhone.This time I got all the details, but the news was not good. The closest Bluetooth headset, Slifter said, was at a Target 9.5 miles away. No trace of Wal-Mart, RadioShack or Verizon. At least I knew what Target charged.I tried the same search using TheFind, another iPhone shopping application, with much better results. Although it missed the Verizon store, TheFind offered up the inventory of both Wal-Mart and RadioShack. TheFind also told me how much my shopping trip had cost me in gas — $1.83 — so I could compare that with the total cost of an Internet purchase. TheFind does not work on any other mobile phone yet, although the company says it’s working on it.I had no sense of the quality of these headsets, so I checked Buzzillions, which culls user reviews from online sources. Like TheFind, Buzzillions works only on the iPhone, for now.The big weakness of all these services is that they may not find items from small, independent merchants — many of which do not post inventories online for the services to search. But executives of the shopping services said even smaller merchants are increasingly moving online, so the mobile shopping experience should improve in the coming year.One future development in particular is worth watching. This month, NearbyNow, an online shopping company, will introduce Is It Me?, a mobile shopping service that formalizes what has become a widespread practice: sending text messages with photos of items you may want to buy.Is It Me? will have its debut on iPhones. It lets users send a photo of a product to a group of people and solicit “thumbs up” or “thumbs down” ratings and comments. The application collects the ratings and e-mails the results.It might not help you save money, but it could save you from sartorial disaster.Fertility help has gone mobile. BabyCenter, a parenting Web site, said it would introduce on Thursday the Booty Caller, a series of 18 ovulation alerts sent via text message. Sample message: “Your fertile window opens today and lasts 5 more days. Heat kills sperm so keep your mate away from the hot tub.” The service is free at babycenter.com. ... Sprint has joined the other three major wireless carriers in eliminating early termination fees, charged to those who cancel their contracts. After a customer’s sixth month in the contract, Sprint’s current $200 penalty decreases by $10 each month. Those who leave the carrier in the 15th month of their contract pay $100. ...

"'08-11-06,'0','In 2007, merchants paid $61.56 billion in electronic payment fees, up from $48.58 billion in 2005, according to the Nilson Report, a payment systems industry newsletter. The report estimated that lenders took in 82.5 percent of those dollars.“What merchants are getting for their money is convenience, risk management and guaranteed payment,” said Denise Dunckel, a spokeswoman for Visa Inc.Various factors make every interchange fee unique. If the magnetic strip on the consumer’s card does not work and a cashier has to enter its number manually, for example, a higher charge results. If the card “rewards” the consumer with cash back or airline miles, that, too, has a higher charge.Beyond setting fee schedules, card agreements also reach into merchants’ daily operations. Merchants who take cards are supposed to accept them for purchases of any size. But to protect profits from customers who use plastic for everything — a recent Visa television advertisement campaign humorously suggested that only social malcontents pay with cash — some small merchants break the rule and set minimum amounts for card purchases.“Why shouldn’t you be able to set a minimum?” asked William Dennis Jr., senior research fellow for the National Federation of Independent Business in Washington. “Some of these small guys may actually lose money on a $2 or $3 credit card charge.”Mitch Goldstone, who owns ScanMyPhotos.com, a photo-imaging venture in Irvine, Calif., and blogs about interchange fees at www.WayTooHigh.com, said he decided to challenge the fees in 2005 after learning that fees on reward cards were going up. “I can barely understand them and I’m a lead plaintiff in the merchant litigation,” he said.The credit card industry contends that merchants are getting good value for their contribution to the rewards card programs.“Merchants derive significant gain from the electronic payments system, which has evolved new features such as rewards programs,” said Trish Wexler, spokeswoman for the Electronic Payments Coalition, an advocacy group in Washington. “Ultimately, merchants benefit from rewards programs because people buy more when they use cards. Higher fees for rewards cards are justified because merchants and consumers both share in their expense — but merchants want to pass their fair share to consumers, who’d be hit with higher credit costs and reduced rewards if the merchants succeed.”Representative Peter Welch, a Vermont Democrat who has sponsored one of the measures in Congress, said he planned to reintroduce a “credit card bill of rights for merchants,” as he calls it. “Our American merchants are paying the world’s highest interchange fees, a fast-increasing cost of business for them, with literally no protections,” he said.The congressman said the merchants told him about their card problems when he set up tables at Vermont country stores. “Some Vermonters who owned multiple gas stations said that to deal with rising gas prices and interchange fees, they wanted to experiment with cash-only at some and the status quo at others, but were told this would violate their card agreements,” he said.In July, the House Judiciary Committee, with bipartisan support, narrowly passed legislation that requires banks and merchants to negotiate interchange fees. The measure is sponsored by Representatives John Conyers Jr., the Michigan Democrat who is chairman of the committee, and Chris Cannon, a Utah Republican who was defeated in the summer primaries. Small banks and credit unions testified that fee reductions would take away badly needed income.Kenneth J. Clayton, director of card policy for the American Bankers Association in Washington, called the bill “a dramatic proposal by big retailers to use political muscle to lower their costs.” Smaller retailers, he said, “are being put up as poster children to show how challenging it is for them. But behind the scenes are big-box stores that see an opportunity to lower their costs of participating in the electronic payments system that benefits them greatly.”Professor Carsrud said that while card fee reductions would save large merchants the most in terms of absolute dollars, small ones would gain, too, because they have few options to reduce costs. “They can’t easily raise prices now, and they may not survive if they slash payroll or marketing,” he said.The National Federation of Independent Business and the National Small Business Association, also based in Washington, remained neutral on the Conyers-Cannon bill and on a companion measure sponsored by Senator Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of Illinois.A spokeswoman for the National Small Business Association, Molly Brogan, explained in an e-mail message: “While we recognize the significant issues surrounding the inability of small businesses to properly negotiate interchange fees — especially with the nation’s top 10 banks controlling 88 percent of credit-card receivables — we are focused on broad credit card reform. Given our diverse membership, interchange fees impact our small businesses differently — some members rely on credit card rewards, offered at the cost of our other members who are forced to pay for them.”Ronald Mann, a law professor at Columbia University and a credit specialist, said he expected that there would be “a tremendous push in Congress in 2009 to adopt important credit card reforms” because of the increased sensitivity to banks’ lending practices.But, he added, “Merchants’ card problems — even though especially pressing for small ones — do not top most legislators’ agendas.”Not far from the Capitol in Washington, the owner of the Cleveland Park Valet dry cleaner, Robert Kotchenreuther, said he counted on customer relations, not legislation or litigation, to keep his card fees down. “I hate credit cards,” he added, “but I’d lose too much business not taking them.”Mr. Kotchenreuther said he had “quite a few customers who are very understanding and caring and pay by cash or check because they know it costs me each time I use the card machine.” He estimated that he paid $5,000 to $6,000 in card fees each year — money, he said, that could “help me upgrade my 1994 van with 125,000 miles.”Mr. Kotchenreuther carries two cards of his own: a small-business credit card and a Upromise credit card that rewards users with college tuition dollars.But Mr. Kotchenreuther said he could not remember the last time he used either card. “If I go to another small merchant, I know he has to pay a fee to use his machine, and I don’t like that — I pay cash.” Nor does he pay with cards at bigger businesses. “If I need a hotel room or rental car,” he said, “I’ll use a card to hold them and pay cash when I get there.”'"
"'08-11-06,'0','Delta Air Lines, the nation’s biggest carrier, said Wednesday that it would charge some passengers to check their first bag, but that it was eliminating the fuel surcharges to book tickets using frequent-flier miles.Delta, whose merger with Northwest Airlines took place last week, was the last holdout among major airlines in charging a first-bag fee.It said it was adopting the fee as it matched its policies with Northwest, which was among the airlines charging to check luggage.“Delta is adopting proven practices from both Delta and Northwest that have been broadly accepted in the marketplace,” said Stephen Gorman, a Delta executive vice president and the airline’s chief operating officer.The airline said it planned to charge $15 for checking the first bag, and $25 for a second bag, for passengers traveling within the United States. The new second-bag fee is half what Delta had charged.'"
"'08-11-06,'0','GMAC, the finance company partly owned by General Motors, lost $2.52 billion in the third quarter, hurt by the housing slump and write-downs on vehicle leases, and said Wednesday that its mortgage unit, one of the nation’s largest home loan providers, might not survive.The loss, GMAC’s fifth consecutive quarterly decline, compared with a loss of $1.6 billion in the period a year earlier and brought GMAC’s losses since the middle of 2007 to $7.9 billion.Its mortgage lending unit, Residential Capital, lost $1.91 billion in the quarter, its eighth consecutive quarterly loss. It has lost $9.1 billion in two years.“Economic and market conditions created an unrelenting environment for our business,” the chief executive of GMAC, Alvaro de Molina, said in a statement. “In this climate, our primary objective is to make prudent use of our resources and take the steps needed to address the reduced access to liquidity.”GMAC said the deteriorating housing market had made it tough for ResCap to maintain adequate capital and liquidity. “Absent economic support from GMAC, substantial doubt exists regarding ResCap’s ability to continue as a going concern,” GMAC said.The finance company’s results will hurt G.M., which still owns 49 percent of GMAC after selling the rest in 2006 to the private equity firm Cerberus Capital Management. G.M. will report its earnings on Friday.'"
"'08-11-06,'0','Mr. Medvedev also proposed new rules that would allow opposition parties marginally more representation in Parliament, challenging the consolidation of power that was the trademark of his predecessor, Vladimir V. Putin, who is now the prime minister. He also proposed granting slightly more self-determination in local administrations.“He showed that he wants to be a real president,” said Konstantin V. Remchukov, editor in chief of the Independent Newspaper, a respected Moscow daily.Sergei A. Karaganov, a prominent Russian political scientist, said he was “amazed” to hear Mr. Medvedev committing to liberalization at a time of crisis.“It went against the wind,” Mr. Karaganov said. “At this juncture, we just need to see whether he follows up on it.”As the speech approached, Mr. Medvedev faced intense pressure to calm nerves in Russia, crippled this fall by capital flight, a plunge in the stock market and a precipitous drop in oil prices. Mr. Putin typically gave the speech in the spring, using it to announce crowd-pleasing investments in infrastructure projects and social welfare programs.Mr. Medvedev, by contrast, had to address the two shocks that had befallen Russia since he became president, the financial crisis and the war in Georgia, while combating the impression that Mr. Putin retained control over major decisions.The speech he gave Wednesday, originally planned for Oct. 23, gave scant information about the government’s economic strategy going forward. It did, however, squarely lay blame for Russia’s troubles on the United States.Mr. Medvedev said that American regulators had inflated a financial bubble and that the ensuing collapse “carried in its downfall to the trajectory of recession all financial markets of the planet.” He also said Washington had started the war in Georgia, saying, “Tskhinvali’s tragedy is, among other things, the result of the arrogant course of the U.S. administration, which hates criticism and prefers unilateral decisions.”But it was the planned missile deployment, a possible early foreign policy test for Mr. Obama, that captured attention in the West on Wednesday.Mr. Medvedev described specific measures Moscow would take if Washington went ahead with a plan to station a missile defense system in Poland and the Czech Republic. He said Russia would post mobile Iskander missiles — tactical weapons designed for use against targets like long-range artillery and airfields, in addition to missile defense systems — around Kaliningrad, an enclave at Russia’s western border. He also said Russia would use radio equipment to jam the Western missile defense system.“These are forced measures,” he said. “We have told our partners more than once that we want positive cooperation, we want to act together to combat common threats. But they, unfortunately, don’t want to listen to us.”Geoff Morrell, the Pentagon press secretary, responded sharply in a telephone interview to Mr. Medvedev’s pledge on missiles, calling it “literally and figuratively misguided.”“The Russians know full well that our European missile defense system is not capable of defeating their enormous ballistic missile arsenal,” Mr. Morrell said with evident frustration. “Rather, it is meant to counter Iran’s growing missile threat. And we have bent over backwards to invite the Russians to partner with us to defeat this common threat.”Speaking more broadly, another senior Bush administration official said the tone of the address “follows a line of attributing blame for things to outsiders, to the U.S.”The second official, who would speak only on condition of anonymity because of the need to maintain relations with Moscow, said it was no accident that the speech was scheduled for the day after the presidential election.“The day the U.S. gets a new president, it’s more important for them to make sure Russians hear what the Russian president says in his State of the Federation speech,” this senior official said. “It’s because it’s all about them. They have to find an outside villain to offset the criticism they are starting to hear about their handling of the economy.”Other analysts agreed that the timing of the confrontational speech was not coincidental. Russian elites have staked their hopes on a victory by Mr. Obama, viewing him as a far friendlier negotiating partner than his Republican opponent, Senator John McCain.“This is a warning, this is a clear warning,” said Alexander Rahr, director of the Russian/Eurasian program at the German Council on Foreign Relations. “I think they want to show that Russia is important and we want a multipolar world.”Clifford Kupchan, a Russia expert at the Eurasia Group, a consultancy in Washington, said the chilly rhetoric was to be expected “in the context of a really bad relationship.”“When a relationship is this troubled, you wait for concrete steps from the new guy,” Mr. Kupchan said. “You wait to see if his policy will be any better than the old one.”In one of his biggest applause lines, Mr. Medvedev said Russia’s policy in Georgia expressed treasured values.“There are things which cannot be traded off, there are things for which it’s necessary to fight and triumph,” he said. “This is what is dear to you, which is dear to me, to all of us. Something we cannot imagine our country without. This is why we shall not retreat in the Caucasus.”For domestic audiences, among the biggest news was the proposed extension of the president’s term by two years. After Mr. Medvedev made his speech, Kremlin spokesmen told the Interfax news agency that the change to Russia’s Constitution would not require a vote, and that it would not apply to incumbent politicians.Political observers were left to puzzle it out: Why would Mr. Medvedev push for a reform that would have no relevance for another eight years? The obvious answer, Mr. Rahr said, is that Mr. Putin is planning a quick return to his old job.“Otherwise, it makes no sense,” he said. “A president in power for four months? This is not only foolish, this is completely impossible.”'"
"'08-11-06,'0','“In short, horrible,” Ian Shepherdson of High Frequency Economics said of the report. “But only to be expected in the wake of the equity plunge and the subsequent collapse in confidence. We don’t expect the headline to drop much more.”All 30 stocks in the Dow declined, with financial shares faring worst. Shares of Bank of America, Citigroup and Merrill Lynch all fell more than 11 percent. The big insurers Ambac and MBIA posted deep losses for last quarter and their shares lost 41 percent and 22 percent, respectively.“I think anytime you do see a rally like we’ve been having, there will always be a little bit of pullback when people wake up and see things like today’s headline number on nonmanufacturing activity, which was the lowest of all time,” Michael Feroli, an economist at JPMorgan Chase, said. “If there’s data out, there’s going to be bad news out. That will tend to keep market enthusiasm a little bit contained.”Earnings also disappointed at several major businesses, offering a bleak assessments of the current economy. GMAC, the finance company partly owned by General Motors, said that it lost $2.52 billion in the third quarter and that its mortgage unit, ResCap, was struggling to survive. Time Warner, the media and entertainment juggernaut, reported a higher-than-expected profit for the third quarter but lowered its outlook; its stock dropped 6.3 percent.The Treasury’s benchmark 10-year note rose 6/32, to 102 13/32. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, was at 3.70 percent, down from 3.72 percent late Tuesday.Wall Street will now turn to Friday’s employment report from the Labor Department, which economists expect will show that 200,000 jobs were lost last month. A separate report released on Wednesday by Automatic Data Processing, a private group, showed that private companies cut an estimated 157,000 jobs in October, the most in almost six years.The A.D.P. report is considered volatile by economists and has been a poor predictor of this year’s employment figures from the government. Still, investors can refer to it as a gauge for Friday’s more important data, and the news was not good. Layoffs spread from automakers, financial and housing-related companies to retailers and other services as the downturn deepened.For investors seeking a silver lining, Wednesday’s market downturn seemed to indicate that Wall Street was once again reacting in predictable ways to negative news. For weeks, traders were in crisis mode, obsessing about arcane credit gauges like Ted spreads and credit-default swaps, and wondering about the outcome of the election. On the top of the wish list for investors was a return to stability.“The market is starting to focus on normal things, like company fundamentals, earnings, macroeconomic data, employment, even market technicals like trend lines,” said Steve Sachs, director of trading at Rydex Investments. “After four or five weeks where none of that mattered, this is the first week we are thinking about that. Markets are moving in a more orderly way.”For those curious about the connection between stock markets and presidential elections, Wednesday’s declines fit in with historical precedent. Since 1888, on average, stocks fell 0.5 percent from Monday to Wednesday of a presidential election week when the Democrats took the White House, according to Jeremy J. Siegel, a professor at the Wharton School. (A Republican victory brought an average return of 0.7 percent.) This week, stocks fell about 1.5 percent over the same period.Over the full four-year term, stocks have historically fared better under Democratic administrations.Stocks in Frankfurt, London and Paris all fell about 2 percent.Following are the results of Wednesday’s Treasury auction of 77-day cash management bills:'"

"'08-11-07,'1','MILFORD, Conn. — The Rev. Jeremiah A. Wright Jr. warned Thursday that the individual successes of Barack Obama and other prominent African-Americans “shouldn’t lull us to sleep” in the effort to combat racism and poverty in America.But Mr. Wright, whose fiery sermons in his years as the pastor of Mr. Obama’s church drew harsh criticism in the presidential campaign, said he believed that racism in America would end as a hugely divisive issue “in our children’s lifetimes.”Speaking at a forum at Kingdom of Life Christian Church on “The Bible, Race, and American History,” Mr. Wright told the more than 400 people who attended that the next step for the country must be to find jobs “for people locked in poverty” and to end “every vestige of dehumanization” in America.In response to questions from the audience, Mr. Wright, who has made few public appearances since his controversial remarks prompted Mr. Obama to distance himself from him in the spring, said the news media had taken many statements from his sermons out of context in an effort to damage Mr. Obama. “Their intent was to use me as a weapon of mass destruction to destroy that man’s candidacy,” he said.But Mr. Wright kept his tone low-key, offering a scholarly dissertation on how he said the Bible had been used in America both to justify slavery and to abolish it.He said that too many people in the world today, both Christian and non-Christian, have the attitude that “if you do not believe what we believe, we will kill you.” He criticized the way Christianity had been taught for years in America. “Our Christian teachings, even in seminaries, are so narrow,” he said.'"
"'08-11-07,'1','Their case was the first to reach a factual hearing since the Supreme Court ruled in June that detainees at Guantánamo are entitled to seek their freedom through federal habeas corpus cases. The justices’ ruling, which was named for one of the six Algerians, Lakhdar Boumediene, opened the door for more than 200 habeas corpus claims.Judge Leon, who was appointed by President Bush, initially ruled in 2005 that the men had no habeas corpus rights.The six detainees had been scheduled to listen to opening statements from Guantánamo by way of a telephone hookup, but a technical problem left them with a silent line, court officials said. If they testify, it is to be with a video feed from Guantánamo.After they were detained in 2002, Mr. Bush said the six men had been planning a bomb attack on the United States Embassy in Sarajevo, Bosnia. But last month Department of Justice lawyers said they were no longer relying on those accusations to justify the men’s detention.In an opening statement before the courtroom was closed, Nicholas A. Oldham, a Department of Justice lawyer, said “the United States has reliable information” about the dangers posed by the men. But Mr. Oldham said, “I cannot talk about the evidence here,” in the open courtroom.Stephen H. Oleskey, one of the detainees’ lawyers, said the men were “victims of a terrible mistake that the government has refused even today to correct.”Mr. Oleskey said the government’s accusations were based on what he described as ethnic profiling of Muslim men. He said the government could not prove that the men considered going to Afghanistan. But he added, “Even loose talk about plans to travel to Afghanistan would be just that: loose talk.”Mr. Oleskey declined to discuss the plan to close the courtroom.But Ramzi Kassem, a lawyer who represents other detainees and who teaches at Yale Law School, said the use of classified evidence was an effort to keep the public from being able to assess the evidence the government has used to imprison hundreds of men.“I think what is happening here,” Mr. Kassem said, “is that the government lost its battle to avoid judicial scrutiny, so they have shifted strategy to avoid public scrutiny.”A Justice Department spokesman said lawyers in the case had no role in classifying evidence, adding that it had been classified by intelligence agencies “for valid national security reasons — well before preparation for this case even began.”Judge Leon, wearing a red and white bow tie set against a blue shirt that peeked through his robes, was the first federal judge to hold a full habeas corpus hearing on a Guantánamo case since the Supreme Court ruling in June.Another federal judge, Ricardo M. Urbina, last month ordered 17 ethnic Uighur detainees released. But in that case, no hearing was needed to establish the reason for their detention because the government conceded that the men were not enemy combatants. A federal appeals court stayed Judge Urbina’s ruling pending an appeal.In the case that began Thursday, government lawyers appear to be taking few chances that the men will be freed.They have filed a sealed envelope of evidence with Judge Leon, which the detainees’ lawyers have not been permitted to see. In court filings the government lawyers said that if the evidence in the closed hearings was not enough to justify the detention, then the judge should open the envelope.Judge Leon, the filing said, “may very well ultimately face the circumstance where the information justifying detention is too sensitive” to share not only with the detainees but also with their lawyers.'"
"'08-11-07,'1','“We were afraid that they would pass Proposition 8,” Mr. Cobos said, “and that’s exactly what happened.”In Palm Springs, another gay-friendly city, Mayor Steve Pougnet said he had performed 115 same-sex weddings since June, when such ceremonies began, some of which had as many as 180 guests. By contrast, this week the city has canceled eight planned ceremonies.“That’s a huge economic impact, which is gone in these difficult economic times,” said Mr. Pougnet, who is openly gay and married his partner in September.Another mayor, Gavin Newsom of San Francisco, was blunt.“It’s a great day for Massachusetts,” Mr. Newsom said, referring to one of only two remaining states to allow same-sex marriage. The other, Connecticut, legalized such unions in October.The approval of Proposition 8 comes even as the state is suffering through another bout of bad economic news. On Thursday, Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, who opposed Proposition 8, in part on economic grounds, announced that the state’s budget deficit had already swelled to $11.2 billion for the coming year, and called the Legislature back into session and proposed higher taxes to address the budget problems.David Paisley, a San Francisco-based marketing executive with a specialty in gay tourism, said California had four of the nation’s top 10 destinations for gay travelers: San Francisco, Palm Springs, Los Angeles and San Diego.Mr. Paisley said that it was too early to speculate on the exact economic impact of Proposition 8, but that some public relations damage might have already been done.“California has always been perceived on the vanguard of gay-friendly destinations,” he said. “Well, when a ballot measure passes says it’s not, it’s terrible publicity for gay and lesbian tourism.”Frank Schubert, the campaign manager for Protect Marriage, the leading group behind Proposition 8, said any potential impact, or the specter of bad press, was overstated.“This is an issue of restoring the institution of marriage as it always existed,” said Mr. Schubert, noting that same-sex marriage had only briefly been legal. “I can’t imagine that returning to the history of 4,000 years before that is going to cause an economic upheaval.”In June, the Williams Institute at the University of California, Los Angeles, which studies sexual orientation and the law, estimated that legalizing same-sex ceremonies in the state would result in about $63.8 million in government tax and fee revenue over three years.Several civil rights and gay rights groups said Thursday that they had asked the State Supreme Court, which legalized same-sex marriage in May, to bar the carrying out of Proposition 8, which went into effect as soon as the result of the referendum was known. San Francisco tourism officials, meanwhile, said they would continue to push the city as a destination for “commitment ceremonies and other celebrations of partnership.”All of which gave a small measure of hope to merchants like Mr. Burnett, who said he would miss the extra work. “Unless,” he said, “we get gay marriages back.”'"
"'08-11-07,'1','Grand jurors investigating a 24-year-old man’s claims that police officers beat and sodomized him with a hand-held object in a Brooklyn subway station last month heard from two key witnesses on Thursday: the man himself and a police officer present during the encounter.The testimony by the two men — Michael Mineo, who has accused four officers of brutalizing him on Oct. 15, and the 26-year-old officer whose account is said to bolster aspects of Mr. Mineo’s claims — came 10 days after the grand jury was impaneled.Mr. Mineo entered the court building where the grand jury is meeting at 12:30 p.m. and left at 2 p.m. The transit officer arrived later and left without being seen by reporters.Neither Mr. Mineo nor Paul Martin, a lawyer for the transit officer, would discuss the testimony in detail.Mr. Martin did say, however, that it had taken time for what his client saw that day to sink in.“I think he saw an incident take place, but the nature of exactly what took place he didn’t piece together until he read it in the newspapers,” Mr. Martin said. The transit officer’s account did not surface until two weeks after the encounter.'"
"'08-11-07,'1','If banks can get government capital that costs as little as 5 percent a year, why shouldn’t the automakers, retailers or even struggling media groups?Unlike banks, such companies weren’t responsible for the current mess.This argument is so seductive that governments across the world will be hard pressed to resist it. Indeed, one of Barack Obama’s first tasks as president may be to announce whether General Motors, Ford and Chrysler get federal aid.But Mr. Obama and leaders of other countries must do their best to stem the torrent of beggars. This is partly because federal aid will drain the public purse at a time when fiscal deficits are already high. Governments should save what little firepower they have left for really deserving cases, like the growing army of unemployed. Bailouts also distort markets: as weak companies are propped up, vibrant ones find it harder to grow.Ideally, governments would make the banking bailouts so unpleasant that other industries would hesitate to request the aid. Sadly, in most countries, that hasn’t happened. Henry M. Paulson Jr., the Treasury secretary, has been particularly lax, allowing banks to sell preference shares to the government with a dividend of only 5 percent. European governments have done a bit better. Only Britain has been adequately punitive, charging its banks 12 percent.It’s not too late to do better.In Europe, some governments like Italy haven’t completed their schemes. If they are too generous, the European Commission could send them back to the drawing board. Indeed, it is already questioning whether Germany’s bailout of Commerzbank, which includes a dollop of capital with a 5.5 percent coupon, is too generous.Meanwhile, in the United States, Mr. Obama has the opportunity to distance himself from Mr. Paulson’s bailout. He can say that Mr. Paulson, the former head of Goldman Sachs, was far too close to Wall Street and, in any case, he was part of the previous regime. It won’t be easy to say no to troubled industries. But doing so is an important test of leadership.'"
"'08-11-07,'1','The findings are part of the agency’s annual World Energy Outlook, which is scheduled to be released next week in full. An 18-page executive summary was made public on Thursday.Much of the growth in oil supplies will come from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, whose members hold the bulk of the world’s oil reserves.The agency said that big new investments would be required in coming decades to meet growing energy needs. Oil and gas investments of $8.4 trillion will be required through 2030, or about $350 billion a year on average.“Globally, oil resources are plentiful, but there can be no guarantee that they will be exploited quickly enough” to meet the expected consumption growth, the agency said.Falling prices are causing some producers to pare investments and delay projects.Saudi Arabia’s national oil company, Saudi Aramco, and ConocoPhillips said on Thursday that they would delay a major expansion at a refinery in Yanbu, on the kingdom’s Red Sea coast, for at least six months.The two companies said they halted the bidding process for the 400,000-barrel-a-day refinery because of “uncertainties in the financial and contracting markets.” Both companies said they were still committed to the project but wanted to take advantage of better contracting terms as prices fall.The energy agency’s experts have become increasingly alarmed in recent years at the slow pace of development of oil resources. The agency’s report includes an extensive analysis of the world’s 800 biggest oil fields. It found that producers would face a steep path just to keep production from declining.Part of the problem, the report found, was that decline rates at existing fields were accelerating, meaning that more oil needs to be found and produced to keep global production from falling.According to the report, in order to offset both natural field declines and meet the projected growth in demand by 2030, the world would need to increase production by 64 million barrels a day, or the equivalent of six times the current production of Saudi Arabia.The global agency also stressed that urgent action was required to curb carbon emissions, which are expected to double by the end of the century. That would push global temperatures up by as much as 11 degrees Fahrenheit, leading to catastrophic global warming, the agency said.“Current global trends in energy supply and consumption are patently unsustainable — environmentally, economically, and socially,” the energy agency said. “But that can — and must — be altered.”The agency said that reductions in the carbon dioxide output of the United States and China, the world’s top two emitters, would be critical to stabilizing global emissions. Carbon emissions from the use of fossil fuels are expected to rise by 45 percent by 2030. Even modest reductions will be difficult to achieve, and will be costly.“The future of human prosperity depends on how successfully we tackle the two central energy challenges facing us today: securing the supply of reliable and affordable energy; and effecting a rapid transformation to a low-carbon, efficient and environmentally benign system of energy supply,” the report said.'"
"'08-11-07,'1','WASHINGTON (AP) — The efficiency of American workers slowed sharply in the summer as a huge pullback by consumers threw the national economy into reverse.The Labor Department reported Thursday that productivity — the amount an employee produces for every hour on the job — grew at an annual pace of 1.1 percent in the third quarter, down from a 3.6 percent growth rate in the second quarter.With productivity growth slowing, labor costs picked up. Unit labor costs — a measure of how much companies pay workers for every unit of output they produce — increased at a 3.6 percent pace in the third quarter, compared with a 0.1 percent rate of decline in the previous period.Worker productivity growth slowed as overall production declined, reflecting the hit to consumers and the economy as a whole from the housing, credit and financial turmoil.In the latest sign of the ailing job market, the number of people continuing to draw unemployment benefits jumped by 122,000, to 3.84 million, in late October, a separate report from the department showed. It was the highest level since late February 1983, when the country was struggling to recover from a long and painful recession.New filings for jobless benefits last week dipped to 481,000, a still-elevated level that suggested companies were in a cost-cutting mode.'"
"'08-11-07,'1','BEIJING — Senior envoys of the Dalai Lama, the spiritual leader of Tibetans, announced Thursday that they had presented Chinese officials in Beijing with a memorandum on “genuine autonomy” for Tibetans living under Chinese rule.Two senior envoys of the Dalai Lama left Beijing on Wednesday. They had arrived in China on Oct. 30 for an eighth round of talks between Tibetan and Chinese officials.The envoys represent the Tibetan government in exile in Dharamsala in northern India. They returned to India on Thursday and released a statement.It did not elaborate on the talks or the memorandum, which seems likely to have set out details of the Dalai Lama’s longstanding call for autonomy in China, rather than independence, a stance that in the past has made Chinese authorities suspicious.The envoys’ statement said that Tibetan leaders had asked them not to discuss the China talks because a meeting of Tibetan exiles was planned for Nov. 17-22. The Dalai Lama called the meeting to discuss Tibet, one of the most volatile issues facing the Chinese government.'"
"'08-11-07,'1','Instead, investors appear to be betting that the worst is yet to come. Stocks that rallied after hitting a year-to-date low on Oct. 27 are heading south again, veering toward a new bottom. The trends suggest that investors remain remarkably skittish. Shares of banks fell on Thursday by 7 to 10 percent, single-day swings that would have been unthinkable a short time ago. These days, fleeting headlines can move the market just as much as interest rate cuts and major economic data.On Thursday, the bad news came in the form of slumping sales at the nation’s retailers, a harbinger of a holiday shopping season that could be the worst in years, according to industry analysts.Not helping matters: a bleak forecast from Cisco Systems, the networking giant, and comments from an executive at General Motors that suggested the company was struggling to survive.Investors may also have been selling ahead of Friday’s report on the job market, which economists say will be grim. The Labor Department is expected to report that employers cut hundreds of thousands more jobs in October, bringing the simmering problems in the labor market to a full boil.The Dow Jones industrial average closed at 8,695.79, down 4.9 percent, its lowest finish since Oct. 28, after swinging in a 518-point range. The S.& P. lost 47.89 points, or 5 percent, to 904.88, and the Nasdaq composite index fell 72.94 points, or 4.3 percent, to 1,608.70.“The market already knows the economy is pretty sick,” Meg Browne, a currency strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman, said. “But there is attention being paid to tomorrow’s jobs numbers. We think they’ll be much worse than the market forecast.”The declines on Wall Street came despite sharp reductions in foreign interest rates by central banks seeking to further ease the tight credit markets. The Bank of England lowered its benchmark rate by 1.5 percentage points, more than analysts had expected, and the European Central Bank cut rates by half a percentage point.Credit markets also showed some improvements. The amount of outstanding commercial paper — short-term i.o.u.’s used by businesses and banks for daily expenses — were up for a second week, rising $50.5 billion, to $1.6 trillion. That is down from the peak in July 2007, but a significant improvement from last month, when the market for such financing virtually froze up.The Treasury’s benchmark 10-year bill rose 4/32, to 102 17/32, and the yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, was at 3.69 percent, down from 3.70 percent late Wednesday.The South Korean central bank joined in the rate activity on Friday morning, cutting its benchmark rate by a quarter point, its third reduction in a month.Nevertheless, the Kospi stock index in South Korea was down more than 3 percent in early trading. Other Asian indexes also fell. The Nikkei in Japan was down 5 percent, and the S.& P./ASX index in Australia fell 3.8 percent.The Labor Department said on Thursday that new claims for unemployment benefits declined last week by 4,000, to 481,000; readings above 400,000 are considered recessionary. The agency also said that worker productivity grew at an annual rate of 1.1 percent in the third quarter, down from a 3.6 percent growth rate in the second quarter.'"

"'08-11-08,'0','“John is going to have to make a decision,” said Senator , Democrat of . “I think he will make the right choice and pitch in.”Many of his colleagues say they believe the same, that Mr. McCain will quickly reassert himself in the Senate and could, if he so chooses, be a valuable asset to Mr. Obama as the new administration seeks to move its agenda on the economy, national security, and , among other issues.“If President-elect Obama lives up to his rhetoric to reach across party lines, and I hope that he will, he is going to need John McCain,” said Senator , a Republican and longtime ally of Mr. McCain. “He is going to be a real player.”In his concession speech on Tuesday night, Mr. McCain said he was ready to do his part.“These are difficult times for our country, and I pledge to him tonight to do all in my power to help him lead us through the many challenges we face,” he said of Mr. Obama, in a speech that many Democrats hailed as promising for its conciliatory tone.Longtime associates of Mr. McCain say they expect him to play a constructive role in the Senate and not sulk in the aftermath of defeat, trying to undermine Mr. Obama. They expect him to rededicate himself to the legislative art in his remaining years in the Senate. “It is just not in his nature to stand still,” said one longtime adviser who would talk about the Senate return only if he was not quoted by name.But there is serious fence-mending to be done. Plenty of harsh words were expressed over the course of recent months, and many Senate Democrats were angered by what they interpreted as a lack of respect for Mr. Obama from the McCain campaign and the senator’s own warnings about the dire perils of liberal Democratic government.Some of the hatchets are quickly being buried. Senator , a Democrat and Senate majority leader, spoke by telephone with Mr. McCain on Friday; according to an aide, they agreed to put the attacks of the last few months behind them. Mr. Reid, who for months during the campaign had carried with him a set of negative quotes about Mr. McCain from fellow Republicans to have ready for recitation, plans on ripping up the quotes, said his spokesman, Jim Manley.Senator , a Democrat who returned to the Senate earlier this year after his own abbreviated presidential primary run, said Mr. McCain would no doubt have to decompress. But Mr. Dodd expects his colleague to get back on track.“He has been a here long time,” Mr. Dodd said, “and people have had their relationships with him, including good ones over the years. And ultimately that is what you remember, and that is what will prevail.”Republicans say it is unlikely that Mr. McCain will bear the blame for party losses in the House and Senate, with most attributing them to miserable economic conditions and President Bush’s lingering unpopularity.“He should come back OK,” said Senator , a retiring Republican whose seat went to a Democrat on Tuesday. “He did the best a Republican could do. The headwinds were just enormous.”Mr. McCain is simply the latest in a long line of senators turned presidential contenders who have had to sheepishly make their way home to the Senate, which until this year has been a political albatross for dozens of presidential hopefuls. Some pick up right where they left off, and some drop off the Senate map or make quick exits.When he last came back to the Senate after being defeated in 2000, Mr. McCain used his ire at Mr. Bush and other Republicans as a springboard for rebellion, starting his zealous pursuit of a campaign finance overhaul and other reform initiatives. He even toyed with the idea of switching parties — though he ultimately found more influence, and the foundations for this year’s presidential bid, in his status as a maverick Republican.Now the Senate waits to see how Mr. McCain will apply the lessons of his latest presidential quest. He has the experience and Senate seniority to make of it what he will.'"

"'08-11-08,'0','It would seem appropriate at this point to give credit to the politician who was perhaps the key enabler of what transpired in the election of 2008.Despite the terrible legacy of Vietnam, it was Lyndon B. Johnson who knew that the injustices of the past had to be rectified in order for our nation to become a true union. His Civil Rights Act and Voting Rights Act were perhaps the two most important pieces of legislation ever passed, and his speech urging passage of the Voting Rights Act was one of the finest presidential addresses in American history.Johnson knew that his stances would change the electoral map forever, but because of what he set in motion, Mr. Obama was able to capture the presidency — and in a time frame of less than two generations. Remarkable.As an African-American whose great-grandparents were slaves in Tallahatchie County, Mississippi, when the Civil War ended, I think that Barack Obama’s election helps me understand, in small measure, how they must have felt when they gained their freedom.They told my maternal grandmother how their whole universe changed, yet it barely changed at all. Freedom was much more complex than expected, with innumerable problems to solve before going to join God and the ancestors in heaven.During the following 30 or more years, two African-Americans, Frederick Douglass and Booker T. Washington (both interracial like Mr. Obama), inspired legions of former slaves, Northern philanthropists and missionaries as well as enlightened Southern whites to establish hundreds of schools and colleges to educate the former slaves.They knew that the plight of African-Americans was not a black problem, but an American problem. In so doing, they saved an economically fragile nation and left a shining example for our country today.Barack Obama’s election to the presidency is a momentous occasion and marks yet another milestone in the fight for full racial equality.But I question the assertion that it is truly the end of the Civil War. Not only does that shortchange the incremental change that has led to this moment, but it also doesn’t acknowledge the reality that the fight for real racial parity — in access to health care, education, employment and so on — is far from over.With his election, Mr. Obama has proved that the possibilities for brilliant, talented Americans can be limitless under the right circumstances. We need now to focus on ensuring that all people — regardless of color and background — have the opportunity to reach their full potential.After reading Thomas L. Friedman’s column, I was reminded of something I was told when I was a little girl.I asked my father, “What am I?” He told me I was an American.“But you came from Egypt, and Mom is from Poland,” I said.He told me that made no difference. I was just an American, and that was what made our country so wonderful.Over 50 years have passed, and I still remember what he said.Now we have elected a president based on his qualities of leadership. Isn’t it time to stop labeling our citizens as Asian-, Italian-, African- or any other kind of hyphenated American?The great strength of our country is in what we are, just American. When we realize that, the Civil War will truly be over.I agree with Thomas L. Friedman that the Civil War is finally over. But I think he misses the mark somewhat.The political strategy of pandering to the “solid South” is what is over. The Democrats pursued that strategy for 100 years and the Republicans for 40 years.Finally Dixie is buried, and the South can free itself from that burden and be truly part of the union.I hope that the military strategies that are most often prevalent in the South will also be buried with this historic election.'"
"'08-11-08,'0','Rich people also suffered in the Depression, and though they generally had more resources to fall back on, Mr. Terkel documented their woes with the same care he devoted to the hardest hit. Diana Morgan, a young woman from a wealthy Southern family, spoke of returning home from college and finding no cook or cleaning woman. The telephone had been disconnected. “And this was when I realized that the world was falling apart,” Ms. Morgan said.Mr. Terkel noted the heavy psychological toll the Depression took on Americans. “The suddenly idle hands blamed themselves, rather than society,” he recalled. “No matter that others suffered the same fate, the inner voice whispered, ‘I’m a failure.’ ”Radicalism swept the land, several of Mr. Terkel’s interview subjects recalled. “People were talkin’ revolution all over the place,” Joe Morrison, a steel worker, said. “You met guys ridin’ the freight trains and so forth, talkin’ about what they’d like to do with a machine gun.” In the Farm Belt, farmers frequently resorted to violence, including the near-lynching of an Iowa judge considered too willing to grant foreclosures.Mr. Terkel, who worked for the Work Progress Administration’s Federal Writers’ Project, was highly sympathetic to the New Deal. The book contains a whole section of New Dealers reminiscing, including the economist Joe Marcus, who recalled the satisfaction of being part of Roosevelt’s crusade. “Laws could be changed,” Mr. Marcus said. “So could the conditions of people.”Jane Yoder of Evanston, Ill., told Mr. Terkel how miraculous it was when her father, an unemployed blacksmith, found a W.P.A. job. “This was a godsend,” she said. “It meant food, you know. Survival, just survival.”“Hard Times” does not romanticize the Depression, but at least a few of Mr. Terkel’s subjects managed to find silver linings. E.Y. Harburg was a young businessman whose company went bust after the crash. His friend Ira Gershwin told him to get a pencil and a rhyming dictionary and get to work. “When I lost my possessions, I found my creativity,” Mr. Harburg said. “I felt I was being born for the first time.”He later wrote “Brother, Can You Spare a Dime?,” the Depression victim’s anthem, and the lyrics to songs in “The Wizard of Oz.”“Hard Times” ends with an interview with Virginia Durr, a grand old Alabama woman I knew years ago when I lived in the state. Mrs. Durr, who fought the poll tax and bailed out Rosa Parks when she was arrested before the Montgomery Bus Boycott, was raised in genteel, sheltered circumstances. The Depression transported her.“It was the first time I had seen the other side of the tracks,” Mrs. Durr told her good friend Mr. Terkel. “The rickets, the pellagra — it shook me up. I saw the world as it really was.”She seems to have been speaking for Mr. Terkel, who also came of age in the 1930s. His lifelong empathy for the disenfranchised was rooted in the troubled era recalled so vividly in “Hard Times.”'"

"'08-11-08,'0','The session was limited to about 20 minutes, and Mr. Obama took nine questions. His answers were purposefully crisp — and, at times, laced with humor — and his presentation stood in contrast to previous news conferences, where he would often devote much more time to a question.Mr. Obama fielded a variety of questions, including one about the kind of dog he would get for his two daughters in the White House. (“Obviously, a lot of shelter dogs are mutts like me,” he said.) He said that he was studying the writings of Abraham Lincoln and that he had spoken to previous presidents.“I’ve spoken to all of them that are living,” Mr. Obama said. “I didn’t want to get into a Nancy Reagan thing about, you know, doing any séances.”A few hours later, Mr. Obama was on the telephone with Mrs. Reagan to “apologize for the careless and offhanded remark.” A spokeswoman for Mr. Obama, Stephanie Cutter, said he and Mrs. Reagan had a warm conversation.But the overall tone of the news conference reflected the challenges Mr. Obama faces.Mr. Obama said he would defer to President Bush and his economic team on major decisions in the next 74 days, saying, “The United States has only one government and one president at a time.”He pledged to find ways to help the struggling automobile industry and invited Gov. Jennifer M. Granholm of Michigan to join his economic advisory board.Mr. Obama, who stood a few feet in front of an array of economic advisers as well as Vice President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Representative Rahm Emanuel, the new White House chief of staff, offered no new specifics about what he intended to do to curb the economic crisis. But the stagecraft of the news conference, held after a closed-door meeting of Mr. Obama’s economic advisers, was intended to show that he was hard at work in search of solutions.Mr. Obama offered little guidance on how he wanted the Treasury Department to carry out the $700 billion government plan to stabilize the financial markets, saying only that he would review any decisions made by the Bush administration. He suggested that he intended to move ahead with his campaign pledge to take away tax cuts for upper-income Americans, but seemed to leave a narrow window of room to adjust his proposal.“I think that the plan that we’ve put forward is the right one,” Mr. Obama said when asked if the wealthiest Americans would pay more taxes next year. “But obviously over the next several weeks and months, we’re going to be continuing to take a look at the data and see what’s taking place in the economy as a whole.”Mr. Obama’s imprecise campaign pledges have caused some confusion about when he would repeal the Bush tax cuts on Americans making more than $250,000 a year.The tax cuts, by law, are set to expire at the end of 2010, but Mr. Obama has said he will repeal them sooner and use the revenues to offset the costs of his health care plan. He left unclear whether a tax bill signed into law next year would make the repeal effective retroactively for all of 2009 as well as 2010.In the days before the election, Mr. Obama’s economic advisers said he would not propose retroactive repeal, but would make it effective Jan. 1, 2010. But Mr. Obama did not say that during the campaign, even as his Republican rival, Senator John McCain, repeatedly criticized him as proposing to raise taxes immediately, in an economic downturn. Mr. Obama did not clarify his intentions Friday.The news conference was held in a windowless ballroom of the Hilton Chicago, only steps from Grant Park, where Mr. Obama delivered his victory speech on election night. The session carried the trappings of an official event, with eight American flags lined against blue drapes, and a freshly made seal on the lectern: “The Office of the President Elect.”Asked how he would respond to the letter of congratulations from President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad of Iran, Mr. Obama said he would review the letter and respond in an appropriate fashion. He said any nuclear ambitions by Iran were “unacceptable.”Mr. Obama seemed at ease, smiling more than he did during many stretches of his presidential campaign. When Lynn Sweet of The Chicago Sun-Times rose to ask a question, Mr. Obama asked why her arm was in a sling.“I cracked my shoulder running to your speech on election night,” Ms. Sweet said.“Oh, no,” Mr. Obama replied with a smile. “I think that was the only major incident during the entire Grant Park celebration.”Mr. Obama is spending the weekend in Chicago, aides said, hoping to get a brief respite after a 22-month campaign. But his transition team was still working to put together a national security team in relatively short order.Two advisers said Friday that a possible candidate for secretary of state was former Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, a confidant of Mr. Obama.'"
"'08-11-08,'0','“I remember having a discussion with a couple of debate preppers,” she said. “So if it came from one of those debate preppers, you know, that’s curious. But having a discussion about Nafta — not, ‘Oh my goodness, I don’t know who is a part of Nafta.’ ”“So, no, I think that if there are allegations based on questions or comments that I made in debate prep about Nafta, and about the continent versus the country when we talk about Africa there, then those were taken out of context,” Ms. Palin said. “And that’s cruel and it’s mean-spirited, it’s immature, it’s unprofessional, and those guys are jerks, if they came away with it taking things out of context and then tried to spread something on national news. It is not fair and not right.”Ms. Palin fought back after the infighting had made its way up to Senator John McCain, who made it clear that that he was upset by the back and forth, and ordered his campaign workers to stop it, aides said. Some in the staff worried that questioning the qualifications of the woman Mr. McCain had chosen as his running mate was damaging his reputation.Ms. Palin said that her experience made her realize how brutal national politics could be. And she had some pungent criticism of the national news media, saying that there had been some bad apples in the bunch.“For the most part, absolutely, media persons, reporters, have been absolutely right on and there has been fairness and objectivity,” she said. “There have been some stinkers, though, who have kind of made the whole basket full of apples, once in a while, smell kind of bad.”Senior McCain aides had moved to quell the divisions earlier in the day. Nicolle Wallace, a senior McCain campaign aide who worked with Ms. Palin, defended her Friday on NBC’s “Today.”“She is perhaps the most un-diva politician I’ve ever seen,” Ms. Wallace said. “The only thing I’ve ever seen her ask for is a diet soda.”Randy Scheunemann — a foreign policy adviser to the campaign who some factions claimed was fired in the final week, but others said had not been — said that some of the claims about her were false, and ultimately damaging to Mr. McCain.“The people that are spreading these lies refuse to go on the record,” Mr. Scheunemann said. “They obviously have no loyalty to John McCain or to the person John McCain chose to be his vice president.”Ms. Palin initially brushed off the criticisms, but upon her return home decided to address them. She said that threats that the Republican National Committee would send lawyers to Alaska to audit the clothes they had bought her were false.“There is no clothes audit, except for when the belly of the plane got cleaned out, all the piles of the clothes that they had in there, they wanted me at my house to go through it and box things up and send it,” Ms. Palin said during a brief interview in her Anchorage office.“There’s no attorneys coming up, and there’s no need for it or anything else,” she said. “But that’ll be nice to have that chapter closed because, as I said from Day 1, I never have asked for anything. I’m not, I’m not keeping anything either.”Mr. McCain has planned his first post-election television interview for Tuesday, when he will appear on “The Tonight Show with Jay Leno.”When Ms. Palin was asked by an entertainment reporter if she would consider becoming a talk show host, she said, “I don’t have any idea of what the next chapter of life is going to open up into, and I look forward to just the surprises that life offers.”'"
"'08-11-08,'0','SYDNEY (Reuters) — Microsoft’s chief executive, Steven A.

I don’t know why they would be either, frankly,” Mr. Ballmer said.He added that he thought there were still opportunities for some kind of partnership around search engines.Shares of Yahoo surged earlier this week on speculation that it and Microsoft were in advanced talks after Google pulled out of the search ad deal with Yahoo.

"'08-11-08,'0','Philip Reed, a former elevator salesman who became a champion of housing and health issues as an openly H.I.V.-positive member of the New York City Council, died on Thursday. He was 59 and lived on the Upper West Side.The cause was complications of pneumonia resulting from leukemia, said Geoffrey E. Eaton, who was Mr. Reed’s chief of staff on the Council.Elected in 1997, Mr. Reed, a black, openly gay Democrat, represented a largely Latino district that encompassed parts of East Harlem, Manhattan Valley, the Upper West Side and the South Bronx. He left office in 2005 because of term limits.Mr. Reed fought for asthma-prevention legislation in a district that had one of the nation’s highest rates of the disorder. He promoted the development of housing for moderate- and low-income New Yorkers, and he fought a plan by the administration of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani to move the Museum of the City of New York from East Harlem to the old Tweed Courthouse, near City Hall. The relocation plan was reversed by Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg.Born in New York on Feb. 21, 1949, Mr. Reed attended Ohio Wesleyan University but dropped out and received conscientious objector status during the Vietnam War. He spent 10 years as a salesman for Otis Elevator in San Francisco, where he was an advocate for gay rights.'"
"'08-11-08,'0','Especially for older children, “you’re doing a disservice by not telling them,” said Jerilyn Ross, director of the Ross Center for Anxiety and Related Disorders in Washington.She described one client, a father, who did not tell his son that he was on the verge of being laid off. “The kid was being a typical teenager, ‘I want this, I want that,’ ” she said. “The father was lashing out telling him that he was spoiled,” instead of explaining his money worries.“Kids don’t want to feel guilty afterwards,” said Ms. Ross, a psychotherapist.And if children feel that they’re kept in the dark, a certain element of trust is lost, she added. She has seen cases, she said, of teenagers who were nervous about going away to college and couldn’t figure out why. After some discussion, they realized that they were afraid no one would tell them if something bad happened while they were away.The fact is, children, especially older ones, are generally much more aware of what is going on than we give them credit for.Michael Cohen, president of the Michael Cohen Group, a company that researches issues related to children, education and health, conducted an online poll on Sept. 29 through Oct. 1 regarding their feelings about the current economic situation. Through social networking and other Web sites, teenagers 13 to 17 were asked a series of questions, like whether they understood what was happening with the nation’s economy and what kind of short-term and long-term effect it might have on their family and communities.“The awareness was much higher than I expected,” said Mr. Cohen, who is also a psychologist and conducted a survey at the behest of the New York City Board of Education of 10,000 children to assess their feelings after the 2001 terrorist attacks.Of the current poll, “almost three-fourths of boys and two-thirds of girls knew that a core part of the problem was people buying homes that they couldn’t afford to pay for and knew that the homes were worth less than when they were bought,” Mr. Cohen said.The other surprising finding — 90 percent thought that the crisis would have a negative effect on the economy as a whole, and two-thirds of the sample thought it “is now having or will soon have a negative impact on my family.”“I thought it would be more opaque,” Mr. Cohen said. “I didn’t think they would see banks going under as an immediate threat to the near future. For the average 16-year-old, the near future is 6 p.m. tonight, and 8 p.m. is the far future.”So the best thing is to sit down and discuss the situation. How you present the news, of course, depends on the age of the children. For instance, Ms. Galinsky said, “little kids don’t have a real conception of money — you just go to the bank and get it. You may need to explain the connection between money and work.”She also has one practical suggestion when talking to young children: Don’t use the word “fired,” because “that conjures up images of guns, and many kids really worry that you’re going to get shot.”The husband of a friend of mine faces the possibility of being laid off from his job in the banking industry. So they sat their three children down — all 10 and younger — and told them, “Mom and Dad are going to be talking about this a lot and we don’t want you to worry,” my friend said. “We told them that ‘we’ve tried to be smart with our money and we have savings and we’ll be fine.’ ”Her 7-year-old daughter does tend to worry, she said, so when they went shopping at Target later in the week, the girl cast a critical eye at all the items going into the shopping cart.“She told me, ‘Mom, it’s going to be a lot of money,’ ” said my friend, who was worried about being identified because of the upheaval at her husband’s work. “Maybe we should put some back.”“I told her that that’s something Mom and Dad will worry about.”My friend handled it well, according to the advice of the experts whom I consulted.Explain the situation clearly but make them feel secure and that Mom and Dad have a plan — even if the only real plan is to bury yourself under the covers until next year.“Don’t hide information, but don’t terrify them,” Mr. Cohen said. If the situation is already so severe that you have to sell your house or downsize apartments, you can say something like, “we’re going to be fine, but we have to move from a four-bedroom to a two-bedroom. However hysterical you may feel, don’t transmit that hysteria.”But don’t paste on a smile and spew sunny platitudes. Be real and don’t be afraid to tell your children that you’re worried.“You can say, ‘It’s hard for me now, but I’m going to be O.K.,’ ” Ms. Galinsky said. Children will almost always take the lead from your attitude. My friend Stephen, who was laid off in 2001, was actually happy to work freelance after almost 20 years on staff.His three sons, then ranging in age from 17 to 5, “didn’t seem concerned,” Stephen said. “If anything, they saw I was much more excited about work.”Don’t make assumptions about what will frighten your children; ask them questions rather than lecture them. And let them offer to help.“It’s incredibly important for children to feel part of the solution, not part of the problem,” Ms. Ross said.In fact, that may be one of the upsides of the current economic situation. We all know — and sometimes are — those overprotective and hovering parents who don’t let their children handle their own problems. As families band together to face their economic woes, some parents may discover that their children are more resilient and more capable of coping with difficulties than they thought.And your teenager may actually understand the need to postpone buying that cool new iPod.If you do choose not to tell your children what is going on, examine your reasons, Mr. Cohen said. Is it because you’re afraid you will be diminished in your child’s eyes if you don’t have a job?Parents like that “are not protecting their kids, they’re protecting themselves,” he said.But don’t expect your children to grasp all the issues immediately. It’s a continuing conversation, Ms. Galinsky said, one that will need to be returned to again and again.Taking the advice I had learned, my husband and I talked with our sons, 13 and 9, over dinner. We laid out the issues as best we knew them, telling them that there would be less eating out and smaller holiday presents, that they have to be more aware of turning off lights and water faucets, but that we would all be fine.They asked some questions, fewer than I expected. They seemed to grasp the basics. Then it was on to something more important — the ballgame was on TV.'"
"'08-11-08,'0','ROME — Italians never quite know whether to laugh or cry at Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi. But many reacted with incredulity and outrage after the prime minister, visiting Moscow on Thursday, amiably called the first African-American president-elect in United States history “young, handsome and suntanned.”Mr. Berlusconi made the remark while meeting President Dmitri A. Medvedev of Russia, saying that Senator Barack Obama’s good looks, his youth and his so-called suntan were “all the qualities” for Mr. Medvedev and the future president to “develop a good working relationship.”Many Italian newspapers gave the comment nearly as much front-page attention as Mr. Obama’s victory itself. The journalist Curzio Maltese wrote in the center-left La Repubblica that “bookmakers wouldn’t even take bets” on how long it would take for Mr. Berlusconi to let slip another of his famous gaffes. “Mr. Berlusconi never fails to live up to our worst expectations.”Mr. Maltese added that just when Mr. Obama’s victory was “inspiring billions of people” to consider “democracy, the most extraordinary triumph of humanity after centuries of bloodshed and intolerance,” Mr. Berlusconi instead contributed “a miserable, vulgar and racist remark, for which he didn’t even have the courage to take responsibility or the dignity to apologize.”A billionaire populist, Mr. Berlusconi excels at deflating such lofty talk. He said that his remark had been “a compliment” and that his critics lacked irony. “If you want to get a degree in idiocy, I won’t stop you,” La Repubblica quoted him as saying. “I say whatever I think.”'"
"'08-11-08,'0','The Park Service is usually given one to three months to comment on leases, Mr. Snyder added.“This is the first time,” he said, “where we have not had sufficient opportunity to comment.”He said he had asked the Bureau of Land Management’s state director, Selma Sierra, to pull the new tracts from the December auction for more study. She refused.Kent Hoffman, a deputy director of the land management bureau’s Utah office, said the Park Service had ample opportunity to review the broad management plan under which the leases were developed, even if it was not given the usual notice of which leases were being offered for sale. Mr. Hoffman added that 37 days remained to air any protests and review the decision about which tracts to lease.If any leases are sold Dec. 19 and subsequently delivered to the buyers before Inauguration Day, however, it will be difficult for the new administration to reverse those decisions.The perennial struggle over the use of public lands in the West, which traditionally pits ranchers, miners and oil and gas interests against environmentalists and groups interested in historic preservation, has been particularly acute in Utah.Many in the state, where resentment of the federal government runs deep, remain angry about the Clinton administration’s decision in 1999 to set aside for protection three million acres deemed to have “wilderness qualities.” The state sued; in 2003, the Bush administration settled and removed protections from those acres.Before the new lands could be opened to leasing, the land management bureau had to revise its resource management plans designating which areas are appropriate for mining, drilling and motorized recreation and which should remain free of such activity. Last week, six such plans, covering the central and eastern parts of Utah, were approved. The Dec. 19 auction was expected to include energy leases of some land previously off limits, like Desolation Canyon. But not until Tuesday did the bureau release the final maps containing the new leases near park boundaries.Kathleen Sgamma, the government affairs director of the Independent Petroleum Association of the Mountain States, said of the new lease proposals, “If you can’t develop oil and natural gas in this part of rural Utah, we might as well concede the United States has lost all interest in energy security.”But David Nimkin, the southwest regional director of the National Parks Conservation Association, said, “It’s very clear that there’s a time clock, and they are anxious to move these out for sale, for obvious reasons.”The leases, Mr. Nimkin said, seem to be “profoundly in conflict with the direction of the new administration and the new Congress.”'"
"'08-11-08,'0','MOSCOW  Russia on Friday received new proposals from the United States to reduce nuclear arms and provide greater access to the Bush administration’s planned missile defense system, as leaders in Washington moved to calm tensions between the two nations.Russia has long protested the plans for a missile defense system, which would station radar equipment and 10 interceptors in Poland and the Czech Republic. American officials say the system in designed to counter an attack from Iran, and would not be used against Russian forcesBut the missile defense plan was a central topic of Russian President Dmitri A. Medvedev’s state of the nation speech this week. Mr. Medvedev announced that if Washington proceeded with the plan, Russia would respond by stationing short-range missiles and jamming equipment at its western border.The new American proposals, reported earlier in the Wall Street Journal, would allow Russian military officials to inspect the American installations. Washington has also proposed reducing stockpiles of nuclear warheads in both countries, as well as long-range nuclear weapons.“We have received them,” said Igor S. Lyakin-Frolov, a foreign ministry spokesman, of the American proposals. “We shall discuss the timing of a new round of talks on this subject.”The missile defense project accelerated during this summer’s war in Georgia, which aroused Polish fears of a newly aggressive Russia. The Bush administration has proposed spending $712 million in the next year to start digging silos in Poland and installing a radar system in the Czech Republic. Democrats in Congress have been more hesitant about moving forward, and Sen. Barack Obama, the president-elect, has criticized the system as unproven.'"
"'08-11-08,'0','ISLAMABAD, Pakistan — Missiles fired from a remotely piloted United States aircraft slammed into a village in the North Waziristan region of Pakistan along the Afghan border on Friday and killed 10 to 13 people, according to a local intelligence official, a Pakistani reporter and two Pakistani television channels.State television put the death toll at 10, and other news reports said the dead included eight local people and five foreigners. The deaths were the latest fatalities in a series of American missile attacks that have drawn increasingly irate protests from Pakistan to senior American officials, including the head of the United States Central Command, Gen. David H. Petraeus, and the American ambassador here, Anne W. Patterson.The Pakistani president, Asif Ali Zardari, and the prime minister, Yousaf Raza Gilani, both condemned Friday’s attack.Since an American commando raid on Pakistani soil in early September, there have been reports of more than 15 American strikes directed at militants hiding out in the Waziristan region.The authorities accuse militants of using Waziristan as a base for attacks both in Pakistan and against the American-led coalition fighting an intensifying war against the Taliban and Al Qaeda in Afghanistan. But Pakistan maintains that the American strikes undermine its own efforts to curb the violence.'"
"'08-11-08,'0','“I don’t take anything for granted any more,” said Stuart Schweitzer, a strategist at JPMorgan Private Bank. “I find it hard to make much of any single day’s trading activity.”Still, this week’s moves, loopy as they were, do offer some insight into what is happening among the investor class. The most conspicuous statistic on the market this week, analysts said, was what was absent: volume.“More and more people are stepping to the sidelines and saying, ‘I just don’t want to be a part of this right now,’ ” Mr. Cass said. “The risk to the downside is just too much. This is one of the reasons we’re seeing incredible volatility.”Indeed, the broader sentiment among investors remains incredibly bearish. Although stocks have swung wildly recently, the larger direction is down; on Thursday, the Dow neared its year-to-date low set on Oct. 27.That discouraged attitude has prompted many investors to simply take their money out of stocks and hold off placing bets until the waters have calmed. The result is a market with fewer players — trading volume on the New York Stock Exchange on Friday was unusually low — which means a handful of big moves can sway the overall direction of stocks.“As more and more people step to the sidelines, it takes fewer and fewer people to have a shift in sentiment to drive the market,” Mr. Cass said. With lower volume, stocks can move “to what we used to regard as extremes, and what we now regard as just another day.”Some of this could explain the gains on Friday. The broad Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index rose 2.9 percent to close at 930.99. The Nasdaq composite index gained 2.4 percent, and the Dow closed up 248.02 points, or 2.9 percent, at 8,943.81, after spending the day in positive territory and surging in late trading.This came despite a brutal report on the labor market that showed the economy lost 240,000 jobs last month and the unemployment rate rose to its highest level since 1994. And investors were faced with dismal earnings from the nation’s two largest automakers, General Motors and the Ford Motor Company, including a $4.2 billion loss from G.M. and a warning that the company might be running out of money. G.M. shares fell 9 percent to $4.36, and Ford’s shares rose 2 percent to $2.02.Some analysts said that the news was so bad, it encouraged investors that governments and central banks might be prompted to put more money into the financial system, which could help prop up businesses next year.“Today was a case of bad news on the economy leading to expectations of more support from policy makers,” Mr. Schweitzer said. “The stars are aligning in favor of a much more aggressive fiscal stimulus in response to a deteriorating economic picture.”But no one seemed willing to read much into the uptick at the end of the day.“You have very low volume and very high volatility. That to me is a sign of a lack of conviction,” Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at Standard & Poor’s, said. “That indicates that investors are not willing to commit capital for any prolonged period of time.”Shares on the major indexes ended the week down about 4 percent after suffering through the worst two-day stretch since 1987.Shares of companies that produce basic materials like metals and chemicals were among those that fared best on Friday, along with utilities and the energy sector. Oil prices rose 27 cents, to settle at $61.04 a barrel.The Treasury’s benchmark 10-year note fell 28/32, to 101 21/32, and the yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, was at 3.79 percent, up from 3.69 percent late Thursday.'"

"'08-11-09,'0','Voters in three states did the right thing last week by defeating dangerous anti-abortion measures on their ballots.In Colorado, an overwhelming vote of 73 percent to 27 percent rejected a wild initiative that would have amended the state’s Constitution to bestow on fertilized eggs, prior to implantation in the womb, the same legal rights and protections that apply to people once they are born. In addition to ending abortion rights, this doozy threatened to ban widely used forms of contraception, curtail medical research involving embryos, shutter fertility clinics, and criminalize necessary medical care.In South Dakota, 55 percent of voters said no to a sweeping abortion ban that its backers had hoped to use as vehicle for challenging Roe v. Wade, the 1973 Supreme Court decision that recognized a woman’s right to make her own childbearing decisions. The defeated measure was a near-twin of the abortion ban handily rejected by voters just two years ago.In California, meanwhile, voters turned back an attempt by abortion-rights opponents to mandate parental notification, the issue’s third ballot defeat in the state in four years.It would be wishful thinking to think these outcomes mean supporters of reproductive rights can now breathe easy. Proponents of the losing initiatives have already said they plan to try again, and no doubt the future of Roe v. Wade will continue to be slugged out in the courts, state legislatures, and in Congress.Yet, along with the election of a new president and at least five new senators supportive of reproductive rights, the fate of the three ballot initiatives is a powerful affirmation that this remains a nation that values women’s privacy and health.'"

"'08-11-09,'0','Winston Churchill’s life spanned the last decades of the British Empire, and to read Carlo D’Este’s enjoyable new biography is to recall the sequence of disasters that befell Britain between the final days of the Victorian era and its brush with extinction in World War II. American pundits these days speculate rather glibly about national decline and imagine that, if it comes, it is something that can be safely and intelligently managed. But genuine geopolitical decline is a serious and often deadly business. Churchill spent the better part of his life fending off increasingly dire threats to Britain’s place in the world, and then to its very existence as an independent nation. A biography of Churchill is in some ways a biography of the British people, with all their remarkable successes, devastating failures, occasional silliness, arrogance and insouciance, and finally their incredible bravery.Bravery was a constant throughout Churchill’s long, eventful life. D’Este notes that “long before he became a statesman,” he “was first a soldier.” The young Churchill, with his miserable childhood and miserable personality, chose military service as a way to make his name and prove himself worthy — especially to his cold and distant father. As a young man, he fought in India and was almost killed. In 1898 he fought under Kitchener at Omdurman and barely escaped death again. Then he fought in the Boer War, where he was captured and escaped. In World War I he served as first lord of the Admiralty, but after the failure of his plan to force open the Dardanelles, which led to the death of thousands of British and Allied soldiers at Gallipoli, he had himself assigned to fight alongside such men in the bloody trenches of Flanders.All of this was decades before he became prime minister and saved Britain, and perhaps the world, from the rule of Hitler and the Nazis. In that role, D’Este argues, Churchill was not merely a politician conducting a war in the manner of Woodrow Wilson, Lloyd George or Franklin Roosevelt. He was a soldier, a “warlord,” a warrior-statesman in the mold of Frederick the Great, Napoleon, Oliver Cromwell or his great ancestor the Duke of Marlborough.This is the main theme of “Warlord,” and it is perhaps a bit overstated. D’Este is a military historian, the author of fine biographies of Dwight Eisenhower and George Patton, so it is not surprising that he sees Churchill as soldier first and political leader second. But Churchill’s greatness as a national leader was as a politician and statesman, which was what he always aspired to be.He loved danger, and he was daring sometimes to the point of absurdity. But whenever the young Churchill threw himself into peril he calculated, even as the bullets flew and the swords cut the air, how the latest bit of derring-do would bring his name to attention back in England. And indeed, by 1900 his fame as a soldier, along with his best-selling books, catapulted him into Parliament. That year Mark Twain introduced him in New York as the “hero of five wars, author of six books and future prime minister of England.” Churchill was 26 years old.At that time, Churchill did not even believe a great military career was possible any longer. Like many of his contemporaries at the turn of the century, he thought large-scale war between great powers was obsolete. As D’Este describes his thinking, “surely civilization had progressed beyond that point in a new century, when nations were more and more dependent upon one another for commerce and common sense had made such nightmares ludicrous.”'"
"'08-11-09,'0','Omar Minaya, the general manager of the Mets, was asked on Wednesday about Willie Randolph, the team’s former manager, at a gathering of baseball officials in Dana Point, Calif. Minaya, who fired Randolph in June, said he would give Randolph a high recommendation to any team that was considering hiring him as a manager.“I hope Willie gets a job,” Minaya said. “Like anything else, the more you do something, the more you learn. You will be better the second time around.”Randolph landed a new job on Saturday, although the new position will not make him a manager. The Milwaukee Brewers announced that Randolph would become the team’s bench coach under the Brewers’ new manager, Ken Macha, who was hired Oct. 30. Randolph had been a finalist for the job.“Eventually, I do want to get back to managing,” Randolph said in a conference call with reporters, according to The Associated Press. “I didn’t really want to wait around. I thought it was best to make this move.”Randolph said that he called Macha to congratulate him after he got the job. Macha offered him the bench coach job about four hours later. “I was really shocked and flattered he called me back,” Randolph said.He is still in contention to become manager of the Seattle Mariners. Randolph said he has an agreement with the Brewers that would let him accept a managerial offer.Randolph experienced incredible highs and lows in his three and a half years as Mets manager. In 2006, Randolph brought the Mets within one win of the World Series. A year later, the Mets blew a seven-and-a-half-game lead with 17 games to play and missed the playoffs. The Mets played poorly through the first two months of the 2008 season. After weeks of speculation about whether Randolph would lose his job, Minaya fired Randolph on June 17 after the first game of a road trip in Anaheim, Calif.'"
"'08-11-09,'0','The job numbers for October, released by the government on Friday, leave no doubt that the nation is in a recession that will be deep and painful. As President-elect Barack Obama said on Friday, Congress cannot wait for a new administration to take action.Lawmakers, no matter how lame-duck they may be, have a duty to pass an extension of unemployment benefits and other measures that directly address surging joblessness and shrinking incomes. Mr. Obama was right to endorse this approach, but as he noted, there is already a sitting president. If President Bush and his team care at all about their legacy at this point, they should support a real stimulus plan, or at the very least get out of the way and not block or distort it.In addition to unemployment pay, the most effective forms of stimulus are bolstered food stamps and federal aid to states and cities so that they can continue to provide health care and other services. Of late, however, the administration has insisted that its bank bailout and inadequate anti-foreclosure plans are the solution to rising joblessness. If Mr. Bush sticks to that script, it will be difficult to enact a stimulus bill that is targeted and timely.Failure to do so, however, would be derelict. After 10 straight months of job losses, the ranks of the unemployed swelled to 10.1 million in October, for a jobless rate of 6.5 percent, the highest since 1994. Worse, the rate would be 11.8 percent if it included Americans who are working part time because they cannot find full-time work and jobless workers who have given up looking for work because their prospects are so dim. Worse still, well over one in five jobless Americans — some 2.3 million people — have been out of work for six months or more, a level of long-term joblessness not seen in the early stages of any recession since World War II.That is not the only way this recession is atypical. Mortgage defaults often rise in a downturn because losing a job makes it impossible for some borrowers to keep up. But this time around, unemployment-related defaults will come on top of millions that have already occurred — and are to come — because of spiking payments on adjustable-rate loans and falling home prices. Rising unemployment, combined with the fallout from junk lending, will prolong the financial crisis and the recession.The Bush administration has rightly thrown money at the financial crisis, and it must now throw more money at the economic downturn. But it must be smart money. Unemployment benefits, food stamps and federal aid to states and cities yield the biggest return for every dollar spent. They are also easy to pare when the economy recovers, thus posing little long-run danger to the federal budget. Tax rebates and other tax cuts, in contrast, pack relatively little bang for the buck. And tax cuts are difficult to take away once granted and so tend to add to the long-term deficit.A package of unemployment benefits and state aid is also easier to build upon in sensible ways. As they extend jobless benefits, lawmakers can also revamp the unemployment insurance system, along the lines of the modernization bill passed last year by the House. Fully paid for by reauthorizing an uncontroversial employer surtax, the bill would enable states to provide unemployment benefits to workers who are often ineligible, like part-timers. Similarly, aid to states could be expanded to include money for roads, bridges and other large projects, creating jobs and, at the same time, upgrading the neglected infrastructure of the nation.'"

But he also expressed gratitude to the transit officer, Kevin Maloney, who came forward, and said he believed that the officer’s testimony — or what he knew of it from news reports, since the grand jury proceedings were secret — supported his own account.“I’m happy,” he said. “I’m real happy he came out and said what he said, because he must have felt bad. I can’t speak for him, but he probably has a heart.”Interviews with Mr. Mineo’s friends and acquaintances depict a man who has had a rough-and-tumble life, who lost both his parents to drug overdoses while he was young, who more than once lost the roof over his head, who has had a longtime ambition to be a rap artist and who had a series of run-ins with the police.If Mr. Mineo’s account of abuse is true, these details, these brushes with the law, are expected to be of little consequence in a criminal case against the officers. Victims of crimes can, and do, have complicated pasts, even unflattering ones. But the courts still consider them victims. And the credibility of Mr. Mineo’s account seems only to have grown in the days since he came forward.Lawyers for the officers deny the most lurid aspects of his account, and it appears inevitable they will make his credibility and background an issue if their clients are charged.Unlike Mr. Louima, a Haitian immigrant who had no history of breaking the law, Mr. Mineo has had multiple arrests, mostly on minor drug possession charges, but also one on an assault charge. That sprang from an April case in which he is accused of hitting a teenager over the head with a wooden stool in the tattoo parlor where he works as a body piercer.That case is also being prosecuted by the Brooklyn district attorney, and the coincidence seems to sum up the duality of Mr. Mineo’s life, one that friends describe as a resilient, stoic struggle against a series of hard knocks and one that court records depict as punctuated by repeated missteps.Friends remember Mr. Mineo as a dutiful baby sitter, someone who could curl up on a futon with his 3-year-old charge, and an ambitious athlete on the track team who was teased when he shaved his legs to gain an aerodynamic edge.“When you’re in the ninth grade,” said Angel Sanchez, a friend from the team, “that’s just not done.”Friends also remember the time he traveled to New York, where he lived as a child, and came back to Pennsylvania with presents for people in his life, including the supervisor at a Burger King who had taken him in when an aunt and uncle tossed him out. She received a St. Louis Cardinals jacket.Pennsylvania authorities say that the money for those presents appears to have come from credit cards he is accused of stealing from the mother of a friend in Lancaster. He is facing two felony counts in that case and is considered a fugitive because he did not show up for his court dates.“People just don’t understand what he’s been through,” said Jessica Aviles, his former boss at Burger King. “He’s had a hard life. You can’t just say, ‘He’s a bad kid.’ ”Mr. Mineo declined through his lawyers to be interviewed for this article. But his lawyer Stephen C. Jackson said: “We’re talking about a very young man, a 24-year-old who lived an active life, and he no longer can do that. He walks with a cane. He’s physically not what he was, not to speak of his mental and psychological state.”The Rev. Al Sharpton, who visited Mr. Mineo when he was in the hospital, said on Saturday that Mr. Mineo never tried to hide his own wrongdoing.“That’s one of the reasons I said this story was compelling to me, is he never tried to sugarcoat himself,” Mr. Sharpton told members of his National Action Network in Harlem, where Mr. Mineo briefly appeared to thank them for their support. “He said, ‘Reverend, I was smoking a joint.’ He said, ‘I did what I did to the joint, and I ran for a minute, and then I turned around, said I’ll take the ticket, and they violated me.’ He didn’t try to say, ‘I’m an angel.’  ”It is unclear where Mr. Mineo was born. He told the police in Pennsylvania that he was born in Dallas. Friends here say he lived in New York City as a child before he transferred to Lancaster’s public schools in 1999.Ms. Aviles said that Mr. Mineo lived with her family and worked with her for five months, and that during that time, he told her much about his early life: that he was an only child, half Italian and half Puerto Rican, who lost his mother when he was 9 or 10 and living in Brooklyn, and his father shortly thereafter, both to drug overdoses.His mother’s parents helped raise him for a time, she said, but they both died by the time he was 14, forcing him to move in with an aunt by marriage and her husband. They lived here, in this city of 56,000 in the heart of Amish country, where they had an apartment at Lancaster Green, a cluster of two-story brick buildings in one of the tougher neighborhoods.At McCaskey, the city’s public high school, friends and teachers said Mr. Mineo was well liked because of his sense of humor. He ran track for a year or so and enjoyed rapping freestyle, or extemporaneously, each day in the lunchroom.“He was a funny guy, and because of that, he could hang out with jocks, cheerleaders, skaters, quiz bowlers,” said Marlon Malpica, a classmate who still works in town.In conversations, he seldom dwelled on his losses, more than a dozen friends and teachers recalled. Many people believed his aunt and her husband were his mother and father, because that was how he referred to them.During his high school years, Mr. Mineo held an assortment of jobs at a movie theater and fast-food outlets.He signed one yearbook as “Mike Meezy,” a play on the name of a rapper, Young Jeezy, and seemed to cherish his school ties.“Don’t forget about the little people and remember high school,” he wrote in Ms. Owens’s yearbook.As graduation neared, he talked about enlisting in the military, but he was held back at the conclusion of his senior year, and school records show he later dropped out.That summer, he moved in rent free with Ms. Aviles, her husband and their 3-year-old daughter when he said his relatives had kicked him out.“My husband and I fell in love with him because he was very well mannered,” she said.Mr. Mineo baby-sat for Ms. Aviles’s daughter, took the girl swimming and once bought her sneakers to match his own, she said. Ms. Aviles said that despite his hard life, Mr. Mineo seldom showed any sadness, though she remembered he once played a sad song for her and said he would give anything just to have two minutes with his mother.Ms. Aviles said she had not seen or heard from Mr. Mineo in five years. In the fall of 2003, he lost his job at the Burger King after missing a shift. A few weeks later, he vanished, she said. People here assumed he took off for New York.“That’s the whole problem with a lot of people in Lancaster: It’s such a small town,” said Ms. Owens, his classmate. “It’s not like New York, where there’s a lot of opportunity. If you’re not in school and don’t have a job or a trade, it’s every man for himself, and a lot of people can’t handle that.”Just before he disappeared, the police in nearby Manor Township accused Mr. Mineo of going on a binge with credit cards that belonged to a friend’s parents. According to court records, he rang up more than $6,100 on the cards, which he was carrying when he was arrested in Queens on a marijuana charge in the fall of 2003.Ms. Aviles said Mr. Mineo appeared at her door in late 2003 to ask that she give back the gifts, including her jacket. She was not home, she said, but he later told her in a phone call that he had done something stupid and needed to make restitution.Extradited to Pennsylvania in April 2004, he spent seven weeks behind bars before his public defender arranged for him to be released on his own recognizance. But he never returned to court, and a judge issued a bench warrant for his arrest on Oct. 29, 2004, that is still in force.Laron Johnson, a friend with whom Mr. Mineo promised to stay with when he was released in 2004, said that Mr. Mineo had talked about going back to New York, where he said he had a girlfriend. “He said, ‘When I get out, that’s where I’m going,’ ” Mr. Johnson said in an interview.In New York, Mr. Mineo has lived in several neighborhoods and pursued a career as a body piercer. As a high school student, Mr. Mineo had no visible tattoos. Now his body is decorated with large amounts of ink. Lady Liberty is on one arm, a leaf of some kind on the other.He never got a city license to give tattoos, though he registered for the training course. But he has earned his high school diploma, according to Mr. Jackson, his lawyer.Until his injuries, he spent most days in Downtown Brooklyn at the Jiggaman tattoo parlor, which is owned by a friend, Jason Amolsch. He shares a three-bedroom apartment in Prospect-Lefferts Gardens with female roommates who refer to him as their brother.One of them, Jilma Brown, said Mr. Mineo was too dutiful to get in much trouble.“He gets up every day, goes to do his piercing, and then comes home and goes to sleep,” she said.It was at the parlor, though, where Mr. Mineo was accused of being involved in the fight last April, in which two teenagers were hurt.Before this most recent encounter, Mr. Mineo twice filed complaints with the city’s Civilian Complaint Review Board, which investigates police misconduct. The board has not released details of those complaints, but neither of them vaulted him from obscurity to the front pages of newspapers, as the most recent one has.In that encounter, police officers chased and grappled with Mr. Mineo, whom they thought they had seen smoking a marijuana cigarette at the Prospect Park subway station. No drugs were found, though Mr. Mineo was given a summons for disorderly conduct.Mr. Mineo said on Saturday that after three weeks in which he felt most people did not believe him, he thought the tide was starting to turn, especially with the transit officer’s testimony.“I want these officers put away; that’s what I want,” Mr. Mineo said. “They don’t deserve to be on the street. Because if you have a badge and you’re here to protect us, and you did what you did to me, you don’t deserve to be on the street.”'"
"'08-11-09,'0','“John is going to have to make a decision,” said Senator Kent Conrad, Democrat of North Dakota. “I think he will make the right choice and pitch in.”Many of his colleagues say they believe the same, that Mr. McCain, of Arizona, will quickly reassert himself in the Senate and could, if he so chooses, be a valuable asset to Mr. Obama as the new administration seeks to move its agenda on the economy, national security, immigration and climate change, among other issues.“If President-elect Obama lives up to his rhetoric to reach across party lines, and I hope that he will, he is going to need John McCain,” said Senator Susan Collins, a Maine Republican and longtime ally of Mr. McCain. “He is going to be a real player.”In his concession speech on Tuesday night, Mr. McCain said he was ready to do his part.“These are difficult times for our country, and I pledge to him tonight to do all in my power to help him lead us through the many challenges we face,” he said of Mr. Obama, in a speech that many Democrats hailed as promising for its conciliatory tone.Longtime associates of Mr. McCain say they expect him to play a constructive role in the Senate and not sulk in the aftermath of defeat, trying to undermine Mr. Obama. They expect him to rededicate himself to the legislative art in his remaining years in the Senate.“It is just not in his nature to stand still,” said one longtime adviser who would talk about the Senate return only if he was not quoted by name.But there is serious fence-mending to be done. Plenty of harsh words were expressed over the course of recent months, and many Senate Democrats were angered by what they interpreted as a lack of respect for Mr. Obama from the McCain campaign and the senator’s own warnings about the dire perils of liberal Democratic government.Some of the hatchets are quickly being buried. The Senate majority leader, Harry Reid, Democrat of Nevada, spoke by telephone with Mr. McCain on Friday; according to an aide, they agreed to put the attacks of the last few months behind them. Mr. Reid, who for months during the campaign carried with him a set of negative quotes about Mr. McCain from fellow Republicans to have ready for recitation, plans on ripping up the quotes, said his spokesman, Jim Manley.Senator Christopher J. Dodd, a Connecticut Democrat who returned to the Senate this year after his own abbreviated presidential primary run, said Mr. McCain would no doubt have to decompress. But Mr. Dodd expects his colleague to get back on track.“He has been here a long time,” Mr. Dodd said, “and people have had their relationships with him, including good ones over the years. And ultimately that is what you remember, and that is what will prevail.”Republicans say it is unlikely that Mr. McCain will bear the blame for party losses in the House and Senate, with most attributing them to miserable economic conditions and President Bush’s lingering unpopularity.“He should come back O.K.,” said Senator Pete V. Domenici of New Mexico, a retiring Republican whose seat went to a Democrat on Tuesday. “He did the best a Republican could do. The headwinds were just enormous.”Mr. McCain is simply the latest in a long line of senators turned presidential contenders who have had to make their way sheepishly home to the Senate, which until this year had been a political albatross for dozens of presidential hopefuls. Some pick up right where they left off, and some drop off the Senate map or make quick exits.When he last came back to the Senate after being defeated in 2000, Mr. McCain used his ire at Mr. Bush and other Republicans as a springboard for rebellion, starting his zealous pursuit of a campaign finance overhaul and other reform-minded initiatives. He even toyed with the idea of switching parties — though he ultimately found more influence, and the foundations for this year’s presidential bid, in his status as a maverick Republican.Now the Senate waits to see how Mr. McCain will apply the lessons of his latest presidential quest. He has the experience and Senate seniority to make of it what he will.'"
"'08-11-09,'0','Recall that from the very start of this mess, major decisions have been made in a hurry, behind closed doors, with many of the participants unidentified. This has led to a natural suspicion among some analysts, financiers and politicians that special pleaders may be on the scene in these smoke-free rooms, securing special favors.The secrecy and opacity that have surrounded some of the trickier decisions — such as allowing Lehman Brothers to fail while saving Bear Stearns — do not engender trust. They create distrust.Because taxpayers are financing these exercises, it seems only right that they know who was in on the decisions, why the decisions were made and who the prime beneficiaries were. It’s been awfully frustrating to watch taxpayer money doled out to the same cast of characters — commercial banks and brokerage firms — that put the nation in such financial peril.The decision to recapitalize the banks was wise. It is a necessary evil, alas, because making sure that money is available to finance a small business, buy a home or send a child to college is the best way to mitigate a recession’s impact.But the fact that the Treasury seems to have attached no strings to the cash it handed to the big banks is inexplicably naïve and indulgent. Now we have the spectacle of banks hoarding the taxpayer cash or refusing to pass along to suffering consumers any of the savings reaped by the institutions’ reduced lending costs. This is both unfair and a recipe for a backlash.HERE is another way the Treasury should be tougher on the institutions that are holding their hands out: force them to raise additional capital in the markets — and swiftly. It may be bitter medicine to issue shares at depressed levels, but this may also be the best opportunity to do so.Think back to what happened earlier this year with Freddie Mac, the giant mortgage finance company now being run by the government. In May, when its stock was trading around $27, Freddie Mac said it would raise $5.5 billion by issuing common and preferred shares. The stock rallied on the news because investors recognized that the company’s capital needs were pressing.But Freddie Mac never did raise the money. And three months later, the government took it over. Had Freddie Mac secured that extra capital, taxpayers would be less vulnerable to the losses they might now face as part of the federal bailout of the company.Lastly, a discussion is needed of how and when taxpayers may be able to exit the bailout business. Although it is understandable that some of the financing programs instituted by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York are open-ended, setting no time limits on the cash spigot is unnerving.Consider the Fed’s new commercial paper facility. It was set up on Oct. 20 to free the stalled market for short-term funds on which so many companies rely for their daily operations. Some $243 billion had been lent as of last week. And by all accounts, the program has helped to reduce the costs of borrowing in that market and helped get it moving again.Clearly the program is necessary now. But it should have some type of maturity date. The problem with an open-ended program is that when interest rates rise, the costs to the taxpayer do, too.There is a lesson to be drawn from the difficulties that companies experienced before the Fed stepped in, when they couldn’t tap the short-term money market: A commercial economy as large as ours should not be built on a short-term funding apparatus.Indeed, it’s just as perilous as constructing an enormous mortgage market on adjustable-rate loans. The sooner that companies curtail their reliance on this market to finance their day-to-day operations, the better off they will be.Taxpayers and investors are paying dearly in this crisis. More transparency, tougher deal terms and clearer exit strategies would do a lot to ease our pain.'"
"'08-11-09,'0','This portrait of the 2008 election is drawn from the results of Election Day exit interviews by Edison Media Research and Mitofsky International with 17,836 voters at 300 polling places around the nation, and of 2,378 telephone interviews with absentee and early voters.Here are some of the details:Voters under 30 backed Mr. Obama over Mr. McCain by 34 percentage points. Only Ronald Reagan in 1984 and Bill Clinton in 1992, each with 19-point advantages among these voters, came close, if it can be called that.Older voters were the only age group to give Mr. McCain a majority. They supported Mr. Reagan in 1984 but switched to the Democrats during the Clinton years. Four years ago, they were President Bush’s strongest age group.Blacks gave Mr. Obama 95 percent of their votes, a record. Mr. Obama also won back gains with Hispanic voters made by Mr. Bush. White voters continued to back the Republican candidate. The exception was whites under 30. They backed Mr. Obama after voting for Mr. Bush in 2000 and 2004.Whites made up 74 percent of voters, the lowest share ever in a nationwide presidential exit poll. Blacks were 13 percent of voters, their largest share ever, but only a slight increase.Four years ago, Republicans and Democrats each represented 37 percent of the electorate. This year, 39 percent of voters said they were Democrats; 32 percent identified themselves as Republicans.Mr. Obama won a majority of independents, the first time a Democrat has done so since exit polling began in 1972.Mr. McCain won strong support among voters who said their family’s finances were better than four years ago. Mr. Obama won among those whose financial situation had deteriorated.Voters with lower incomes typically vote Democratic, and they did again this year. Mr. Obama won 60 percent of voters with annual household incomes under $50,000. Mr. Obama was also backed by a majority of those making over $200,000, a remarkable turn for a Democrat. Four years ago, Mr. Bush’s strongest showing was among wealthy voters.City dwellers sided with Mr. Obama. Voters in small towns and rural areas preferred Mr. McCain. Suburban voters were closely split. A majority of suburban women voted for Mr. Obama; most suburban men backed Mr. McCain.Mr. Obama won majorities in the Northeast, Midwest and West. Mr. McCain won in the South, which Republicans have won since 2000.'"
"'08-11-09,'0','But such lawsuits are just the most overt sign of the burdens that lead harried lawyers in Michigan to talk openly about “McJustice” and in New York to make dark jokes about the plea bargain “assembly line.”“In my opinion, there should be hundreds of such motions or lawsuits,” said Norman Lefstein, a professor at the Indiana University School of Law — Indianapolis, and an expert on criminal justice.“I think the quality of public defense around the country is absolutely deteriorating,” Mr. Lefstein said, asserting that unless states spent more on lawyers, the courts would force them to delay trials or, as has happened in a few cases, threaten to drop charges against unrepresented defendants.The most immediate impact of the rushed justice, Mr. Lefstein and Mr. Carroll said, is that innocent defendants may feel pressure to plead guilty or may be wrongfully convicted — which means the real offenders would be left untouched. Appeals claiming inadequate defense are very difficult to win, experts say.In a 1963 decision, Gideon v. Wainwright, and subsequent cases, the United States Supreme Court ruled that poor criminal defendants are entitled to government-paid representation.Here in the 11th Judicial Circuit of Florida, the defenders’ office has had its budget cut by 12.6 percent in the last two years, said the elected chief defender, Bennett H. Brummer, and the workload has climbed by 29 percent over the last four years.State Senator Victor D. Crist, chairman of the Criminal and Civil Justice Appropriations Committee, is a vocal critic of the Miami-Dade lawsuit, saying Mr. Brummer is “blowing things out of proportion.”Mr. Crist said the judicial system had faced smaller cuts than other parts of government. Although no defendant should be denied due process, he said, the courts, state’s attorneys and public defenders must all tighten their belts. He said defenders’ offices could increase efficiency by, for example, more carefully choosing which cases require depositions and other time-consuming actions. He said they should impose fees on clients, even if the sums were low or payment was delayed.Legal defense is a right, Mr. Crist said, but “quality education is a right as well, and proper policing and safety in the community and maintaining standards in our prisons.”Mr. Brummer countered: “There’s a race to the bottom here. As the loads worsen, the more experienced lawyers leave. But the cases continue to come in.”This puts defenders like Arthur J. Jones, 30, on a treadmill of frustration. In his Miami office on a recent morning, Mr. Jones looked over a printout listing 155 current clients. He spent a frantic morning in court, handling arraignments and plea bargains for 23 offenders, a majority of whom he had never met before. His cases involve lesser felonies like cocaine possession, burglary and grand theft.Mr. Jones, in between hushed conversations with clients in the hallway or the holding pen, said he wished he had more time to investigate cases and could go to trial more often, rather than accepting the police version of events and then, after a short discussion, helping his clients make a life-altering deal.“I’d love to have time to visit the crime scene and do more legal research,” Mr. Jones said.In Missouri, the system has not added staff members in eight years, while the annual number of cases has grown by 12,000, said J. Marty Robinson, the director of the state’s public defenders. “We’re on the verge of collapse,” he said.Mr. Robinson appealed to an oversight commission, and beginning last month, defenders in more and more counties are declining misdemeanor cases and others that are unlikely to result in incarceration.In Kentucky, the state public advocate, Ed Monahan, filed a lawsuit that would allow defenders to turn down cases they cannot ethically handle. “Since Gideon, I don’t remember a time when the challenges to adequate representation have been so great,” Mr. Monahan said. In Kentucky as elsewhere, though, some senior legislators say that public defenders must share the fiscal pain.Similar lawsuits are pending, or offices have turned down clients this year, in Tennessee, Minnesota, Maryland and Arizona.In New York City, financing from the city and state for criminal defense declined by $2.7 million this year, from a budget of just over $90 million. Meanwhile, the annual number of cases has climbed to 226,000, from 210,000 in 2006.The city’s Legal Aid Society is promoting a bill before the City Council that would set caps on the number of clients each lawyer could take on. But this would require a significant increase in funds at a time when both city and state face large budget shortfalls.The hurried processing of even misdemeanor pleas can have serious consequences for the accused, noted Deborah Wright, president of the Association of Legal Aid attorneys, the union for New York defenders. Even if they get no jail time, such defendants still get a criminal conviction, which can affect immigration status and some public benefits.Michigan requires counties to protect the indigent without providing state funds, resulting in large disparities. In some counties, those charged with misdemeanors are not even offered a lawyer; in others, the judge hires one for a flat fee, creating a conflict of interest and incentives to skimp on defense, according to a recent report by the National Legal Aid and Defender Association and the Michigan Bar Association. County and state officials acknowledge the problems, but counties say they cannot fix them without funds from a state government that is already reeling.On the positive side, Mr. Carroll of the defender association said that Nevada, Louisiana and Montana had recently acted to shore up public defenders.In Miami, as elsewhere, cases involving serious felony charges, potentially involving prison terms of decades or life, more often go to trial. Amy Weber, who has worked in the office for five years, handles about 50 serious felony cases at one time — too many, she said. “The stakes are a lot higher and the cases involve lots of witnesses, lots more discovery,” she said.On one day in April, Ms. Weber had 13 cases set for trial, so she had to arrange for delays in all but one. That same day, James A. Simons, 59, who was in jail on child pornography charges, was offered a plea: one year in prison. Ms. Weber said she simply had no time to discuss the offer with him, but that he would have accepted it and ended his case.Not receiving an immediate agreement, prosecutors gathered more evidence and rescinded the one-year offer. Mr. Simons ultimately had to accept a five-year sentence. “My client suffered and it makes me feel terrible,” Ms. Weber said. “You try to tell yourself you can only do what’s possible.”Her colleague, Mr. Jones, left his $44,000-a-year job on Monday for private practice, saying he could not support his children and pay off school loans on that salary. A few weeks earlier, he had to tell a 53-year-old man who was charged with grand theft, for stealing a few locks from a Home Depot, that the state was offering five years because earlier convictions made him a “habitual offender.” In a discussion in a holding pen, his client asked, “Won’t they take one year?” Mr. Jones went back to the prosecutors, who calculated that the minimum sentence, under a scoring system here, would be 2.6 years. But Mr. Jones had no time to check their math.The man was already resigned to taking that sentence when the prosecutors discovered their calculations were mistaken: the correct minimum was 366 days.“You see how easily accidents can happen?” Mr. Jones said. “He easily could have gotten three years instead of one.”'"

"'08-11-09,'0','The people Joseph Berger interviewed and the sentiment he captured for his article about the effects of the economy in Chappaqua (“Feeling the Wall Street Pinch at Home,” Nov. 2) are great examples of why we are in this economic mess in the first place. The value that they place on their extreme, inflated wealth and income has fed the greed and hubris that resulted in risky investments and the house of cards that has come down.To compare the loss of human life and the hideous tragedy on Sept. 11, 2001, with material wealth is absolutely disgraceful. These people should be ashamed of themselves and what has become of their value system. Am I to believe that the stress of having to buy overpriced take-out rather than eating out is comparable to knowing that your loved one suffered for hours in a burning building trapped on the 101st floor? The financial planner who can actually compare the death of a friend to the loss of a job... what does this say about our society? The overemphasis and reliance on exaggerated — and mostly borrowed — wealth is at the core of what got us all here in the first place.Regarding the Generations essay by Paula Span (“Hatless, and Aging on My Own Terms,” Oct. 26):Who in this world is too old, too set in their ways or too snooty to make new friends? Life changes as you grow older. People move to new locations where they know no one or are old enough to have friends die and slowly leave you by yourself in a self-centered society. We no longer meet fellow parents at school or we live in a new community where the women we meet have been there for years and have established groups of friends. The other change in a woman’s life is the death of a spouse, and slowly most of the couples you have been friends with stop inviting you to join them for an evening out. What then? No, it is never too late to meet new people.I hope none of the above happens to you, Paula, but everyone is entitled to enjoy themselves (as they are doing no harm to anyone) without being looked down on by you, me or anyone else. Open your eyes to new things and you will be surprised at what joy can be found in the world around you.“I’d read about such folks,” writes Paula Span, referring to women who are members of the Red Hat Society.'"
"'08-11-09,'0','THE Wall Street financial meltdown may have one bright spot for state and local officials and environmental groups that have worked for a decade to preserve as publicly owned open space a 1,000-acre swath of shoreline in Old Saybrook, Essex and Westbrook.The property, situated just north of Interstate 95 and west of the Connecticut River, is owned by a subsidiary of Lehman Brothers, which is now bankrupt. Before last month’s financial crisis, plans were to develop the parcel into a community called the Preserve that included 200 houses and a golf course.Many of those who favor the state’s acquisition of the property say they believe the Lehman collapse is nothing but good news for the long-standing efforts to keep the section of forest sprinkled with ponds, marshes and granite outcroppings in its natural state. Respected environmental groups like the Nature Conservancy, Connecticut Fund for the Environment and the Audubon Society all contend it is environmentally crucial to keep the Preserve from being developed because it is the largest unprotected coastal forest between the Connecticut River and New York City.Part of the parcel abuts some 500 acres of protected open space.“The state’s interest in purchasing and preserving it remains strong,” said Dennis Schain, communications director for the State Department of Environmental Protection. “We’ve continued to make our interests known to Lehman Brothers and their representatives.”Attorney General Richard Blumenthal, another vocal advocate of the state’s effort to buy the land, said he had what he characterized as recent meaningful discussions with Lehman representatives. But Mr. Blumenthal said that the financial giant’s bankruptcy did not mean such a purchase would be simple, or even imminent.'"
"'08-11-09,'0','Mrs. Oxendine is past president of the Long Island National Cemetery Memorial Organization and past national president of American Gold Star Mothers, which offers support to and represents mothers of those killed while in the military.Mrs. Oxendine, 82, wanted to create the memorial garden to help those who lost loved ones, she said. And she seemed a fitting choice.She was born on Memorial Street in Middle Village, Queens, and lost her son Pfc. Willie Oxendine III, a marine, on Memorial Day in 1968, when he was killed in Vietnam. Both Mrs. Oxendine’s son and husband, Willie Oxendine Jr., are buried here.It took three years for the memorial garden to become reality, with money coming from the American Legion, Veterans of Foreign Wars, the United States Submarine Veterans of WWII and Farmingdale’s Rotary Club, among others.The memorial at the 365-acre cemetery contains 118 shrubs, 1,228 bulbs, a Japanese maple tree and four stone benches in the center.Cheryl Anne Lombardo, 49, a horticulturist who lives in Bay Shore, designed the garden. “I came down here and it spoke to me,” she said at the event.Emily Toro, who was celebrating her 49th birthday, said she would use the garden when she visits the grave site of her son Isaac Cortes, an Army private buried nearby. Since he died at the age of 26 in Iraq last November, Ms. Toro said she had come only about four times. “It’s hard,” she said. “It’s hard to come, but I plan to come more often.”Jeanin Urbina, 21, came with her niece, Cydney, 9, and her father, Agustin, 56, to pay respects to her brother, Specialist Wilfredo Urbina, of the Long Island National Guard’s 69th Infantry unit, and to see the memorial garden. Specialist Urbina, of Baldwin, was 29 when he died four years ago in Baghdad.“I think it’s nice to have a place to sit,” Ms. Urbina said. “It gives you perspective.”Ms. Burlone and her family watched with others as the color guard marched around the memorial. They listened as the pledge of allegiance was said, prayers were led and the national anthem sung. American flags flapped in the breeze as a salute was fired by members of the American Legion in Babylon, and taps was played.“To me it’s the perfect setting,” Mr. Rhoades, the cemetery director, said after the event, pointing to rows of white marble headstones of soldiers killed in action, buried to the left and right of the garden memorial.Before she left, Ms. Burlone said she would return the next weekend to spend more than 10 minutes — maybe an hour — visiting her nephew, Corporal Ramon, who was a sniper in Iraq. She said he died at age 22 in 2006 on July 20 — Independence Day in Colombia, which he left when he was 5.He seemed certain he would not return after his second tour of duty, Ms. Burlone said. “But I know he’s around,” she said with swollen eyes. “He’s always around.”'"
"'08-11-09,'0','“I told him we weren’t in any position to make an offer,” Mr. Gandara said, explaining that they needed to sell their apartment before buying another one. After their conversation with Mr. Gross, their casual visit took on a tone of possibility. “He offered to look at our apartment and sell it for us very quickly.”Later that month, at the suggestion of Mr. Gross, they listed their 15th Street apartment at $1.15 million. They had the windows cleaned and packed away toys and clutter in a rented storage space to improve the apartment’s appearance.In nearly a decade, their family, as well as their apartment, had doubled in size. Originally, they had bought a one-bedroom one-bath unit for $145,000, but in 2000, after Alejandro was born, they learned that the one-bedroom one-bath apartment next door was on the market. They paid $210,000 for that, and a year later, the two were combined to form a two-bedroom two-bathroom home.Alejandro and Joaquin shared the small second bedroom. The master bedroom was one of those New York miracles of space management: a Murphy bed was folded up each morning to accommodate a baby grand piano belonging to Ms. Monge, a piano teacher.With a hopeful eye on the Hell’s Kitchen condo, the couple began holding open houses. “Right off the bat, we got an offer,” Mr. Gross said. “But after we accepted it, two or three days later, they got cold feet.”Among the visitors to subsequent open houses were Jack Miskell, a commercial photographer, and his wife, Anne Marie Landolfo, who manages his studio on 18th Street and Fifth Avenue.“I liked the layout,” Mr. Miskell said. “I liked everything about it.” Considering a move from their TriBeCa loft, the couple were tempted by the apartment’s proximity to their studio. But in the end, Mr. Miskell said, they were hesitant to buy in an uncertain market.And when their daughter was admitted to the Professional Performing Arts High School, on West 48th Street near Eighth Avenue, “that changed everything,” Mr. Miskell said. The family moved to a West 43rd Street rental.Other visitors included Alex Dinelaris and his wife, Nyla Mabro, who for two years had been renting a two-bedroom apartment in Stuyvesant Town. In that time their monthly rent had risen to $3,900 from $2,900, an increase that prompted Mr. Dinelaris and Ms. Mabro to consider making their first purchase.“We came to this one absolutely by accident,” said Mr. Dinelaris, 40, a playwright and screenwriter who was raised in Washington Heights. “We were in the neighborhood, coming to this building to see another apartment that was downstairs. There was some sort of mix-up, and they said, ‘Do you want to see another apartment, on the seventh floor?’ ”Mr. Dinelaris and Ms. Mabro had capped their price at $950,000, and knew the co-op, at $1.15 million, was out of their league. But, “it was the only one we went to that actually felt like a home,” said Ms. Mabro, 34, who is from England and works as a strategist for a trend-spotting company.Both Mr. Dinelaris and Ms. Mabro work mostly from home, and were quick to recognize the space they needed: an office for Ms. Mabro in the small second bedroom, and, for Mr. Dinelaris’s writing, a nook where Mr. Gandara practiced his French horn. They were discouraged at the apartment’s price, but seduced by its charms.When three more open houses yielded no offers, Mr. Gross suggested lowering the asking price to $995,000. The couple agreed. “I think the asking price was optimistic,” Mr. Gandara said.Encouraged by the price cut, Ms. Mabro called Mr. Gross to offer $995,000. But the new asking price had generated a bidding war. Ms. Mabro and Mr. Dinelaris offered $1.02 million. When Mr. Gross called with news of a higher bid, they went to $1.03 million and wondered how long and how high the bidding would go.When Mr. Gross asked for their final offer, Mr. Dinelaris was firm: “I said, ‘Look, our bid is one million fifty. We understand if we don’t get it. But don’t call me again telling me it’s more. I don’t want to know that anybody bid a million fifty and one dollar. Don’t call back unless it’s happening.’ ”Days later, Mr. Gross did call back. They had outbid their rivals, and were “solvent and solid,” he said, alluding to the guaranteed mortgage that Ms. Mabro had secured.After closing in late May, Mr. Dinelaris and Ms. Mabro moved into their new home in July.Meanwhile, Mr. Gandara and Ms. Monge and their sons moved to the Hell’s Kitchen condo, paying $1.14 million. Though the family miss the liveliness of Union Square and picnicking in Stuyvesant Square, they have settled in.Ms. Monge now teaches piano in the living room. And Mr. Gandara, who had lamented the hours spent on the subway, walks to work.“It gives me a lot more family time,” he said. “Now, in between a rehearsal and a concert, I can go home rather than staying uptown to avoid the subway ride.”'"
"'08-11-09,'0','Money talks, but in a good economy, it tends to do so using signs and symbols like cars and clothes and real estate. When times get hard, though, money loses its mouthpieces, and people must speak out loud about their finances, using actual words. “My 401(k) is in the toilet.” “I can’t believe I’m about to pay four bucks for a glorified cup of coffee.” “I used to dream about retiring, but now all I dream about is keeping my cable.” Talk may be cheap, but when the markets are falling, prices are rising and credit is tightening, it’s a uniquely affordable indulgence.My grandfather told me it would be this way. He was a child of the Depression. That fabled period, the way he talked about it, had a twofold effect on his family and friends: it laid them low financially while drawing them closer personally. The agent of this coziness was language. As he described it for me when I was small and had no interest in his reminiscences other than the present I might get for indulging them, the Depression caused people to huddle around the radio, listening to speeches by F.D.R., after which they’d sit out on the porch and chat with one another and the neighbors. During one of these chats, he reported, he warned his father not to sell his ragged stock portfolio because the economy would come back someday. As it happened, his father didn’t heed my grandfather, but the crux of the story wasn’t poor market strategy but the fact that, during the Depression, conversation among kinfolk flowed in a way that it no longer does.But would again someday, my grandfather predicted.For me that someday came a couple of weeks ago while I was shopping in a warehouse store, loading my cart with cases of Campbell’s soup, a couple of 12-packs of canned tuna and an alarmingly corpselike sack of rice that my son and daughter, 7 and 9, had to help me hoist off the shelf. I’d been listening to talk radio that morning and caught a warning from a frantic right-winger urging his audience to stockpile food. Though I didn’t usually heed such doom-and-gloomers, I decided to change my policy on panics, now that I’d seen one on Wall Street: get out in front of them.“What’s a depression, Daddy?” my daughter asked me as her little brother looked on. He was inside the shopping cart, exhausted, sitting in a narrow channel between the apocalyptic bag of rice and a three-pack of heart-healthy pomegranate juice in plastic gallon jugs. The juice was pricey and perhaps unsuited to a period of deprivation, but my plan was to consume it in tiny glassfuls and then reuse the containers to store water, or maybe even gas.“That’s for the grown-ups to worry about,” I answered, but a few minutes after I spoke, I changed my attitude, afraid that I’d missed a golden opportunity for just the sort of nostalgic discourse that my grandfather cherished.'"
"'08-11-09,'0','According to the International Air Transport Association, a trade association that represents and tracks roughly 230 airlines worldwide, traditionally big draws like the Bahamas will see drops in flights in coming months compared with last winter. For example, flights from the mainland United States to Freeport, on Grand Bahama Island, are expected to drop to 85 a week in December — peak holiday season — from 134 last December. Using the same parameters, flights to Nassau are expected to drop from 376 to 292; flights to Marsh Harbour, in the Abaco islands, will drop from 122 to 41.Hunter Keay, an airline industry analyst for Stifel Nicolaus, explained that air travel generally was shaping up to become a “mid-priced luxury good.” One reason, he said, is that airlines were already anticipating a passenger slowdown because of the weakening economy, and began cutting capacity accordingly, starting after Labor Day. “Airlines were already out ahead of the curve in terms of reacting to a challenge in demand,” he said. “Rather than reacting to the slower demand environment, they were sort of proactively cutting in advance of it. The capacity cuts are really just starting to get legs now.”However, the news for travelers isn’t totally bleak. Though industry analysts like Mr. Keay didn’t expect significant relief from major carriers, he noted that passengers could end up catching a break wherever low-cost carriers fly.In 2002, when airlines, still reeling from the effects of Sept. 11, made similar capacity cuts, JetBlue stepped in with new flights from New York’s Kennedy Airport to San Juan, effectively breaking American’s monopoly over the route. This year, the traditionally low-cost carrier looks to take advantage of major carrier cutbacks again, having announced a number of new routes to the Caribbean for this coming season.MOST important, perhaps, JetBlue said its daily flights to San Juan from Kennedy will increase from four to seven by December. The carrier is also adding several new flights to San Juan out of Boston and Orlando and Fort Lauderdale, Fla., throughout the season, and Air Tran is adding flights to San Juan from Orlando and Baltimore Washington International Airport starting Dec. 18. That’s in addition to its existing service out of Atlanta.On the whole, things will have just about evened out for San Juan by peak vacation season. According to the I.A.T.A., flights from the mainland to San Juan’s Luis Muñoz Marin International Airport are still expected to crest in December at 811 a week. That’s only about a 6 percent drop compared with 863 weekly flights last December. Meanwhile, flights to the smaller Isla Grande airport, also in San Juan, look to increase: up to 28 a week this December compared with 17 last December.Other discount airlines, like Spirit Airlines, have similarly added Caribbean routes for this season. And even major carriers that are making cuts in some areas, like Delta and American, are adding new routes elsewhere. As a result, some islands, like Grenada and Trinidad, are actually getting more service this season than they did last winter, I.A.T.A. figures show.American Airlines is adding new service this season to Grenada and Antigua from Miami, while Spirit Airlines has new direct service to Port-of-Spain, Trinidad, from Fort Lauderdale. Starting Jan. 31 American will offer a new route from Chicago to Montego Bay, Jamaica, five times a week.Starting Dec. 20, Delta will begin two new direct flights to the Caribbean: from Kennedy Airport to Bonaire, in the Netherlands Antilles; and from Atlanta to the Dominican Republic.And JetBlue will offer twice daily flights to Nassau from Fort Lauderdale, and new daily service from Orlando, starting Feb. 1, pending government approval. The carrier is also expanding its daily New York service to St. Maarten by adding a new weekly route from Boston, starting Feb. 14, also pending government approval.'"
"'08-11-09,'0','WHEN the 42-story J. P. Morgan building at 15 Broad Street was converted to condominiums in 2004, in a development known as Downtown by Philippe Starck, it was an instant success, with prices quickly rising. Since then, it spawned many imitators in the Financial District.Now, with the economy uncertain, even 15 Broad Street, with its panoply of amenities, including a bowling alley, a basketball court, a swimming pool, a yoga studio and a stylish terrace overlooking the New York Stock Exchange, may not be immune to the market downturn, as many owners, from investors to hedge-fund kingpins, head for the door.As of last week, 36 apartments were for sale in the building, more than 10 percent of the 326 apartments. In October, only two apartment sales there were filed with the city, but 13 apartments went on the market, according to listings on Streeteasy.com. Two-thirds of the apartments listed before last month had lowered prices.But with adversity comes opportunity. As Elizabeth Stribling, president of Stribling & Associates, noted in a recent report, the market is in a “state of pause not of standstill,” leading sellers who were planning to sell eventually to “seize the moment.”At 15 Broad Street, a hedge-fund manager has listed a six-bedroom duplex apartment for just under $11 million, although it is now three separate condos and the buyer would have to break down walls to combine them. If the seller gets his price, it will be one of the largest and most expensive apartments ever sold in the Financial District.'"
"'08-11-09,'0','While the rural interior of the country has changed little in the last 50 years, the huge, buffet-to-beach inclusive resorts and a blighted downtown Kingston, once high on the jet-setters’ dance cards, would now discourage Fleming. He lived in Jamaica when you could get there by banana boat, and he described Negril on the west coast as a “five-mile crescent of unbroken, soft, white gold sand, fringed for all its dazzling length with leaning palm trees.”In 1947 Fleming wrote a portrait of his adopted home in Horizon magazine, influential enough to fuel a postwar tourist boomlet among well-heeled Britons and Americans. “I have examined a large part of the world,” he wrote. “After looking at all these, I spent four days in Jamaica in July 1943. July is the beginning of the hot season and it rained in rods everyday at noon, yet I swore that if I survived the contest I would go back to Jamaica, buy a piece of land, build a house and live in it as much as my job would allow.” He did just that, as foreign manager for Kemsley Newspapers.The Palisadoes at night is still as Fleming described it in “Dr. No,” a “long cactus-fringed road” with “the steady zing of the crickets, the rush of warm, scented air ... the necklace of yellow lights shimmering across the harbour.” Not so Morgan’s Harbour Hotel, now an estranged and shabbily furnished cousin of the “romantic little hotel” from “Golden Gun.”Kingston, reached by the road used in the first car chase in “Dr. No,” sits beside bright blue waters and beaches littered with broken boats and the rusting remains of bygone industry. It feels like an early Bond film — vibrant, colorful and a bit disconcerting. What Kingston does not resemble, for the most part, is itself from the Fleming days. Justine Henzell, a Kingston native whose father, Perry, was a writer of the reggae-fueled movie “The Harder They Come,” was my guide to the city. As we wandered downtown, Ms. Henzell pointed out the urban shadows of former elegance, including an empty lot by the water where the Myrtle Bank Hotel, once one of the Caribbean’s most glamorous, had stood. The vacant space now borders a parking lot where hundreds of young people reveled to loud dancehall beats in the middle of a Sunday afternoon.When Fleming made his first visit to the island 65 years to the month when I was there, he chose to stay in the cooler climes of the Blue Mountains. I followed his lead that evening and took the B1 road, which curls itself up into the mountains. My destination was Strawberry Hill, an 18th-century coffee plantation turned resort owned by Chris Blackwell, the founder of Island Records. A Jamaican native, Mr. Blackwell is part of Fleming lore himself, thanks to his mother, Blanche Blackwell, who was, depending on your source, either the writer’s close friend or his mistress and muse. That connection helped Mr. Blackwell, at age 24, land a gig as a location manager for “Dr. No” (you can spot him dancing in a bar scene filmed at Morgan’s Harbour), and his resort franchise includes the Fleming home on the North Coast.Over a breakfast of scrambled eggs and Blue Mountain coffee (the same morning fare Fleming preferred and Bond nearly always enjoyed) on the balcony of a private bungalow, guests overlook the same vista Bond did in “Live and Let Die,” where he “had his breakfast on the veranda and gazed down on the sunlit panorama of Kingston and Port Royal.”Most of Fleming’s days in Jamaica, though, were spent on the northern coast, best reached by the A3, or Junction Road, “that runs across the thin waist of Jamaica.” Bond and his local sidekick Quarrel travel the same route in “Live and Let Die” to get to the secret island lair of the villainous genius Mr. Big.The mountainous interior of the island, “like the central ridges of a crocodile’s armour” as Fleming put it in “Live and Let Die,” is a constant pull on the steering wheel, back and forth, through little villages, past cliffside sundries shops and on numerous detours into rutted, gravel-spattered dirt roads. It’s a relief to reach the other side and spill into the ramshackle town of Port Maria, its pristine aquiline bay punctuated by the diminutive and uninhabited Cabarita Island, which inspired Surprise Island, the fictional hideout of Mr. Big.Fleming and his wife, Ann, were married in Port Maria’s town hall, which still stands. She didn’t share her husband’s love of Jamaica, never staying as long as he did. But his best man and local neighbor, Noël Coward, was equally smitten with the place. Coward was a year-round island resident and a tax exile who died there in 1973. The home he built, Blue Harbour, is a compound of seaside bungalows overlooking Port Maria’s bay. Guests can now stay there if they can find it. The only marker is a small, faded sign pointing down a heavily potholed road leading to a rusty white gate.Judging by the décor and electrical wiring, Blue Harbour has pretty much been left untouched. But despite its rough edges, provincial food and generally musty condition, it has three things going for it: a stunning perch over the sea, a cliffside saltwater pool and a rich history. You can imagine a rotating cast of celebrities like Errol Flynn (who also lived on the North Coast), Katharine Hepburn, Elizabeth Taylor, James Mason and Laurence Olivier, all lounging poolside. The living room is hung with pictures of celebrities like Sean Connery, Alec Guinness clowning in the pool in Arabian headdress and a group shot that included the Flemings.The scene became too much for Coward, who relocated to a higher perch above Blue Harbour. His retreat from his retreat, Firefly, is now a museum and his grave site. His friends gave their homes colorful names as well. Fleming’s haven, about 10 miles west, was Goldeneye, named for a wartime operation he was involved in, and now one of the most exclusive resorts on the island. Between the two writers lived Blanche Blackwell, at Bolt.Of his mother’s relationship with Fleming, Chris Blackwell simply told me that she was a good friend of his and was very fond of him. As a thank you gift for a stay at Goldeneye, Ms. Blackwell gave Fleming a small boat she had christened Octopussy. She may have also been an inspiration for Honeychile Rider, the Bond girl from “Dr. No,” who, like Ms. Blackwell, was the Jamaica-born child of an old island family and a passionate student of sea life.Situated in the small town of Oracabessa, once a banana port, Goldeneye is an unassuming patch of land with stone paths and trees planted by former famous guests. Handwritten signs mark the mango planted by Pierce Brosnan, the lime tree by Harrison Ford, the royal palms by the Clintons. Set among them are three villas that, with Fleming’s original house and a restaurant overlooking the ocean, make up the current property. Where the restaurant sits, a gazebo once stood. Fleming liked to take notes in it, and it once served as a command station when Prime Minister Anthony Eden of Britain visited Goldeneye in 1956 (another boon for Jamaican public relations).The Honeychile villa, just over a small fence from Fleming’s house, is nicely appointed with a plush bed draped in mosquito netting, a claw foot tub and an outdoor shower built into a large banyan tree. The bedroom is flanked by a second house with a patio overlooking the sea and a bookshelf housing a nearly complete set of the Bond stories (written a hundred feet away). It is hard to imagine the resort retaining that kind of casual intimacy when Goldeneye’s 100-acre residential development currently under construction is finished in the coming years.Establishing his life in Jamaica was a necessary precursor to Fleming’s pursuit of fiction. “One of the first essentials is to create a vacuum in my life which can only be satisfactorily filled by some form of creative work,” he wrote in the Evening Standard of London. His training as a Reuters correspondent was another ingredient in this equation, allowing him to write with a don’t-look-back, free-flow technique. Six weeks later you have a novel, he wrote, and “if you sell the serial rights and film rights, you do very well.” Indeed.Before mass-market guides like Frommer’s and Lonely Planet, travelogues were tourists’ main resources outside Europe. For the 1950s Caribbean, Patrick Leigh Fermor’s “The Traveler’s Tree” was the bible. Mr. Fermor visited Goldeneye and glowingly wrote that “it might serve as a model for new houses in the tropics ... great windows capture every breeze, to cool, even on the hottest day, the large white rooms.” His description is apt. The small house’s windows are still without glass. Past the sunken garden is the private beach to which Fleming often trod — fins, mask and spear in hand. The small rock pool Fleming built for his son, Casper, is still standing. Black crabs crawl along its walls, recalling the swarm of them that Dr. No uses to try to torture Honeychile to death. This perch out to the reef that shielded the snorkeling writer from sharks and barracuda directly inspired Fleming’s work.Of the entire 007 cannon, the short story “Octopussy,” written in 1962, best captures his island lifestyle. The story is about Major Dexter Smythe, a Briton “irretrievably tied to Jamaica,” attracted to the “paradise of sunshine, good food, cheap drink, a glorious haven from the gloom ... of postwar England” but later bored from consorting with the “international riffraff” of the north shore. His one joy is exploring the local sea life, including the eponymous octopus to which he feeds conch.Fleming’s gardener, Ramsey Dacosta, who still works at Goldeneye (now in guest relations) and invariably referred to Fleming as the Commander, told me that his old employer would bring conch to an octopus at the reef, and, as in the short story, “the octopus would return the shell.” Bond makes a brief appearance in “Octopussy” to arrest Smythe for a wartime theft, but Smythe takes his own life, with help from the octopus. Fleming died a much less dramatic death from a heart attack in 1964 in England, where he is buried.Goldeneye is the mecca of any Fleming pilgrimage, but not the heart of it. In Horizon, he wrote about the other elements that made his life in Jamaica fulfilling, from the food (“delicious and limitless”) to the weather, calypso and, most importantly, the people. Fleming wrote that the locals “will surprise and charm you,” which they often did during my time there.But even in Fleming’s lifetime, Jamaica was evolving. By the time he wrote his final Bond novel, “Golden Gun,” in 1964, the island had gained independence from Britain, and Fleming’s nostalgia for the colonial era is channeled into his spy. Waiting in the Kingston airport for a flight to Havana, the secret agent recalls his “many assignments in Jamaica and many adventures on the island ... the oldest and most romantic of former British possessions.” As he reflected on his escapades in “Dr. No” and his love affair with Honeychile Rider, “James Bond smiled to himself,” Fleming wrote, “as the dusty pictures clicked across his brain.”Air Jamaica flies from Kennedy Airport in New York to Kingston and Montego Bay. According to a recent online search, flights for travel next month start at about $500.Ashanti Oasis (Hope Gardens, Kingston; 876-970-2079) is an open-air vegetarian restaurant in the middle of the peaceful botanical gardens. The menu varies daily, but you can’t go wrong with a combination platter of the day’s tropically inspired dishes and a fresh juice. Lunch for two is around $1,300 Jamaican dollars, about $17 at 75.8 Jamaican dollars to the U.S. dollar.The Seaside Terrace at Round Hill Hotel and Villas (John Pringle Drive, Montego Bay; 876-956-7050; www.roundhill.com) feels as if you’ve gone back 50 years when Jamaica catered to the rich and famous. The enormous bar is lined with black-and-white photos of celebrities from that era, and you can enjoy hearty à la carte fare like escovich snapper sandwiches on coco bread ($18; American currency is widely accepted for payment) under umbrellas by the water.ON THE TRAIL OF THE MAN BEHIND 007Other than its proximity to the Kingston airport, the only reason to stay at the underfurnished Morgan’s Harbour Hotel & Marina (Palisadoes Road, Port Royal; 876-967-8040; www.morgansharbour.com; about $140 for a standard double room) is its association with James Bond lore. The famous secret agent stayed there in the novel “The Man With the Golden Gun” and the first 007 film, “Dr. No,” used the hotel’s grounds as a shooting location.A former coffee plantation turned luxury resort, Strawberry Hill (New Castle Road, Irish Town; 876-944-8400; www.islandoutpost.com; starting at $395) is high in the Blue Mountains outside Kingston. Some individual bungalows include private kitchens and four-poster beds.Goldeneye (Oracabessa; 876-975-3354; www.islandoutpost.com; the one-bedroom villa starts at $660), Ian Fleming’s former home, has been transformed into one of the most exclusive resorts in Jamaica, complete with private beach and a restaurant. Staying the night in the three-bedroom villa where Fleming wrote the James Bond novels can cost up to $3,400, but the three villas are a plush and intimate consolation.Judging by the condition of the rooms, Blue Harbour (Port Maria; 575-586-1244; www.blueharb.com; $200) has changed little since Noël Coward made his home there. The stunning views of the ocean and the cliffside saltwater pool help guests overlook the mustiness.'"

"'08-11-10,'0','Those were my thoughts when, a few minutes into his victory speech, just after midnight, Obama told his daughters, “And you have earned the new puppy that’s coming with us to the new White House.”Not out of my deep affection for dogs, fond of them though I am. But because while we’ve all known that Obama is a very skillful politician, he hasn’t until now been a particularly empathetic one. Competence plus warmth is a pretty potent combination. Suddenly visions of the two great modern realigning presidents — (with his Scottish terrier Fala) and Ronald Reagan (with his Cavalier King Charles spaniel Rex) — flashed before my eyes. Maybe a realignment could be coming.Obama was, naturally, asked about the promised-but-not-yet-purchased puppy at his press conference Friday. (If one were being churlish, one might say that it was typical of a liberal to promise the dog before delivering it. A results-oriented conservative would simply have shown up with the puppy without the advance hype.)Obama commented wryly that the canine question had “generated more interest on our Web site than just about anything.” He continued:“We have two criteria that have to be reconciled. One is that is allergic, so it has to be hypoallergenic. There are a number of breeds that are hypoallergenic. On the other hand, our preference would be to get a shelter dog, but, obviously, a lot of shelter dogs are mutts like me. So — so whether we’re going to be able to balance those two things, I think, is a pressing issue on the Obama household.”Here, in a few sentences, Obama did the following: He deepened his bond with every dog lover in America. He identified with every household that’s tried to figure out what kind of dog to get. He touched every parent with a kid allergic to pets. He showed compassion by preferring a dog from a shelter. And he demonstrated a dry and slightly politically incorrect wit by commenting that “a lot of shelter dogs are mutts like me.”Not bad. It could be a tough four or eight years for conservatives.It will be tougher yet if they underestimate Obama. His selection of as chief of staff suggests that Obama’s not going to be mindlessly leftist, and that he’s going to shape a legislative strategy that is attentive to Congressional realities while not deferring to a Congressional leadership whose interests may not be his own. Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton were both tripped up in their first two years by their Democratic Congresses. Obama intends for Emanuel to ensure that that doesn’t happen.And Obama has the further advantage of inheriting a recession that will give him a very tough first year or two (for which he won’t be blamed), but that should be followed by a recovery well timed for his re-election bid.So Obama will be formidable. But conservatives should welcome the challenge. It’s good for conservatism that conservatives will have to develop refreshed ideas and regenerated political skills to succeed in the age of Obama.And it wouldn’t hurt for Governors , , and the other possible 2012 G.O.P. nominees to begin bringing some puppies home for their kids.'"

"'08-11-10,'0','More New York City residents voted for Barack Obama on Tuesday than for John Kerry in 2004 and for Al Gore in 2000. But an analysis suggests that overall turnout increased only slightly from four years ago.The analysis helps to show how Mr. Obama, the Democrat, beat Senator John McCain, the Republican, by a ratio of nearly four to one, and reflects voting patterns seen elsewhere in the country. Mr. Obama received about 1.84 million machine votes in the city, and Mr. McCain’s total fell a little below 500,000.Voting was heavier this time than in 2004 in districts that strongly supported Mr. Obama, among them Park Slope and Bedford-Stuyvesant, both in Brooklyn, and the Upper West Side and Harlem. But turnout was depressed in other neighborhoods like Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, where Mr. Obama did less well and where Mr. McCain apparently did not generate much enthusiasm either. With polls predicting that Mr. Obama would easily win the state, some McCain supporters may have stayed home.The expectation about Mr. Obama’s performance and the resulting inactivity may have also reflected the McCain campaign’s efforts here: While about 15 percent of the people who voted for Mr. Obama said they had received some contact by his campaign, only about 2 percent of McCain voters said they were contacted by the Republican’s campaign, according to exit polls taken by a consortium of television networks.Both candidates recorded their highest shares of votes in Brooklyn. According to the preliminary machine count on Tuesday, Mr. Obama carried the predominantly black 55th Assembly District, which includes Brownsville, with 98 percent of the votes from the nearly 35,000 people who cast ballots. In 2004, fewer than 30,000 people there voted at the polls.'"

"'08-11-10,'0','The government’s original emergency line of credit, while saving A.I.G. from bankruptcy for a time, now appears to have accelerated the company’s problems. That short-term loan came with a high interest rate — about 14 percent — which forced the company into a fire sale of its assets and reduced its ability to pay back the loan, putting its future in jeopardy.The new deal would make the government a long-term investor in A.I.G., something that Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. had said he hoped to avoid. As part of the revamping, the government would lower the loan amount to $60 billion from $85 billion, lengthen the payment schedule to five years from two years, and lower the interest rate.At the same time, the government, using part of the $700 billion fund, would buy $40 billion in preferred shares in A.I.G. In return, A.I.G. would pay a 10 percent interest rate on those shares, similar to the interest rate that banks agreed to pay last month when they received cash injections.The government is also planning to spend an additional $30 billion to help A.I.G. buy up a type of securities called “collateralized debt obligations” that the company had agreed to insure against default. As the insurer of those securities, A.I.G. has been forced to put up large amounts of cash as collateral as the global economy has soured and the securities seemed increasingly likely to default.Indeed, these securities, worth hundreds of billions of dollars, are held by institutional investors around the world, a fact that government officials have cited to justify saving the company using taxpayer money.The new arrangement calls for A.I.G. to put the securities into a new entity, effectively removing them from the company’s balance sheet. A.I.G. would contribute $5 billion to the new entity, which would buy $70 billion of the securities at 50 cents on the dollar, or $35 billion. The remaining $30 billion of the purchase price would come from the government.Finally, the government would invest another $20 billion in A.I.G. to help the company buy residential mortgage-backed securities that it also insured, and similarly place them into another entity off the company’s balance sheet.The goal of both programs is to create separate entities to buy and hold the most toxic assets A.I.G. had promised to insure, so that if their value continues to fall A.I.G. would not have to account for those losses. The company has argued that the securities’ falling value does not necessarily mean it has suffered a financial loss.Once A.I.G. buys the securities back from its trading partners, it will no longer have to provide cash as collateral under the terms of its insurance contracts — and collateral has been eating up more of A.I.G.’s cash than anything else since the broad financial crisis began.A spokeswoman for the Fed declined to comment. A spokeswoman for the Treasury did not return a call for comment. A spokesman for A.I.G. declined to comment.A.I.G. negotiated the original $85 billion revolving credit line with the Federal Reserve after its efforts to raise money from private lenders failed in the panic of mid-September. The amount that it needed ballooned in just a few days, as counterparties to A.I.G.’s insurance on complex debt securities laid claim to whatever collateral they could get.People briefed on the negotiations said the $85 billion was thought at the time to be the maximum amount that A.I.G. would need, including a little extra for a cushion. The interest rate was set at the three-month Libor plus 8.5 percent, which currently works out to around 14 percent. (Libor, or London interbank offered rate, is a commonly used index that tracks the rates banks charge when they lend to each other.) In exchange for making the loan, the Fed was promised a 79.9 percent stake in A.I.G.The $40 billion of preferred shares will not change the size of the government’s stake in A.I.G., people briefed on the plans said.Edward Liddy, the insurance executive brought in to lead the company out of the crisis, initially said he believed the Fed money would be like water pouring into a bathtub — a lot might be needed at first, but eventually the tub would be filled and the faucet could be turned off.Since then, A.I.G. turned out to need more money than expected, and it has not been able to sell subsidiaries quickly enough to pay down the loan as required.Even as the government works to solidify A.I.G.’s finances, elected officials have been demanding a fuller accounting of the company’s business practices and executive pay structure. In October, the New York attorney general, Andrew M. Cuomo, reached an agreement forcing A.I.G. to freeze payments to former executives.“I find it hard to conceive of situation that you could justify a performance bonus for management that virtually bankrupted the company,” Mr. Cuomo said after the agreement was made.That agreement followed the revelation, in a hearing convened by Representative Henry A. Waxman, Democrat of California, that the former head of A.I.G.’s troubled financial products unit, Joseph J. Cassano, had been put on a retainer of $1 million a month after being dismissed in February.Mr. Waxman, as well as Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, have demanded that A.I.G. provide a more detailed accounting of its credit derivatives business.'"
"'08-11-10,'0','MOSCOW — From the department of silver linings comes this item from Russia: because of the financial crisis, plans for a controversial skyscraper that would have towered over St. Petersburg’s low-slung Baroque skyline have been delayed and — preservationists, architects and many residents fervently hope — may never be carried out.The mayor of St. Petersburg has submitted an amendment to next year’s budget to cut money for the city’s first skyscraper, which was to have been financed with Gazprom, the Russian oil and gas behemoth that has itself suffered financially with the spectacular decline in energy prices.With general revenues declining, city officials said they would instead use the money to build a soccer stadium. They did so after Gazprom reneged this fall on its pledge to finance the stadium, said Mikhail Amosov, an opposition politician and the former chairman of the city council’s planning committee.From the start, the proposed design for the tower by the London firm RMJM drew considerable criticism, the twisting facade alternately being described as evoking a flickering gas flame or a corncob. But the principal complaint from historical preservationists was its height.The building would soar 1,299 feet, shattering a czarist-era rule that no structure, other than a church spire, should exceed the height of the city’s centerpiece building, the former Winter Palace, now the Hermitage Museum. Before the law was changed specifically for the Gazprom project, the zoning restriction at the proposed site was 138 feet.So contentious was the proposed height that three of four foreign architects on the selection committee resigned rather than consider any design of that sort in downtown St. Petersburg. Critics took to calling it the “Gazoskryob,” or “gas scraper.”'"
"'08-11-10,'0','Indeed, gloomy talk of an industry shakeout is getting louder as returns at most funds sink lower. Over the last few months, some funds have been forced to dump stocks and bonds because their investors want their money back. Wall Street traders worry that another big wave of withdrawals in mid-November could further unsettle the markets.All of which makes the big winners stand out even more. Hedge fund returns, on average, are down 20 percent. But one in every 50 funds is up more than 30 percent — an astonishing performance, considering the broad stock market is down even more than that.Winners include trend-followers like Mr. Drury; market-spanning macro funds, which dart in and out of an array of markets and bet on everything from Apple Inc. to zinc; and niche players that are buying insurance policies or making loans to small companies.Some of this year’s stars are familiar names on Wall Street. For instance, a fund managed by John Paulson, who reportedly was paid $3.7 billion in 2007 after betting against the subprime mortgage market, has gained nearly 30 percent this year in his largest fund, investors say.But some of the other moneymakers are not well known, and could benefit as competitors close and investors look for new places to park their money. Hedge-fund traders who make a killing are often lionized within the industry. One good year can vault a small player to the big leagues.But with so many funds down — only one in three has made any money this year — the price of admission to the winner’s circle has fallen. A showing that would have been considered dismal only a year ago is now viewed as a standout success. Traders even joke that down 10 percent is the new break-even. Actually making money is all the more rare.“This year, anything north of 10 percent is spectacular,” said Pierre Villeneuve, managing director of the Mapleridge Capital Corporation, a $750 million hedge fund in Canada that is up 18 percent.Other funds with big winnings include R. G. Niederhoffer Capital Management; Conquest Capital Group; MKP Capital Management; the Tulip Trend Fund, run by Progressive Capital; and funds run by John W. Henry & Company.Never before have so many funds been down. In 5 of the last 10 years, fewer than 15 percent of hedge funds lost money. Even in the worst year, 2002, 31 percent finished down, according to estimates from HedgeFund.net, a unit of Channel Capital Group. This year, some 70 percent of hedge funds had lost money from Jan. 1 through the end of September.To a degree, hedge funds are hostage to their stated investment strategies, and investors judge them accordingly. Funds that specialize in convertible bonds and stocks, for example, are among the worst performers this year because those markets have been hard hit in the financial crisis.Losers include well-known traders like Kenneth C. Griffin, who runs the Citadel Investment Group; Lee S. Ainslie, head of Maverick Capital; and David Einhorn, the head of Greenlight Capital, who called attention to the troubles at Lehman Brothers before many others.Still, funds that specialize in investment strategies that have suffered could come out looking good if they manage to post even modest gains. For instance, Exis Capital, a $150 million fund that trades stocks, is up 9 percent this year, even after the fund’s manager took their 50 percent fee, according to investors. The average stock fund, by comparison, is down 22 percent, according to estimates from Hedge Fund Research. In commodities trading, Touradji Capital Management is up 11 percent even as its competitor, Ospraie Management, was forced to liquidate a large fund.At some hedge fund companies, this year’s performance is mixed. Trafalgar, a hedge fund in London, manages 10 funds. Three are down, but two — a volatility fund, and “special situations” fund — are up more than 20 percent, according to an investor.Trafalgar declined to say what special situations it had pounced on. Volatility funds, a category that is broadly doing well, focus on trading options and try to profit when the markets swing wildly as they have lately.Lee Robinson, co-founder of Trafalgar Asset Managers, said his firm’s success set it apart from competitors.“Every investor is going to say, ‘What did you do in September ’08, what did you do in October ’08?’ and if you were down significantly, you’re going to have trouble raising money,” Mr. Robinson said. “The most important question is not, ‘How much money am I getting back?’ it’s ‘Do I get my money back?’ ”Several managers who are doing well did not want to brag at a time when so many of their industry colleagues were struggling.“You don’t do victory laps,” said Adam Stern, a partner at AM Investment Partners, whose volatility fund is up 6.75 percent this year. “It’s a very sad time for a lot of people. People worked very hard, and they’re losing a lot of money and net worth.”Marek Fludzinski, one of this year’s winners, remembers what it was like to be a loser. Mr. Fludzinski, the chief executive of Thales Fund Management, was among the computer-loving quantitative fund managers who suffered in 2007, when his fund lost 8 percent. Investors immediately began asking for their money back, so Mr. Fludzinski shut the $1.6 billion fund and started anew.Now his computer-driven fund, created in May, has grown to $350 million from $80 million in assets and is up 14 percent.Mr. Fludzinski said the important factor in running a hedge fund these days was simply surviving.“Don’t do something that will kill you,” said Mr. Fludzinski, who uses a database with 14 years of prices on thousands of stocks to try to spot patterns like the forced selling of stocks.Marc H. Malek, a former UBS trader who manages $611 million, is up 44 percent in his macro fund. But even as new investors approach his company, Conquest Capital, the firm is also receiving redemption requests from investors who want their money back, Mr. Malek said. Investors are pulling cash from wherever they can.A growing number of troubled hedge funds are temporarily refusing to give investors their money back by freezing their funds, in industry parlance. But others are profiting from the waves of panic that have convulsed the markets this year.Roy Niederhoffer, founder of R. G. Niederhoffer Capital Management, whose more famous brother, Victor, made and then lost a fortune trading, is up more than 50 percent. To predict how investors will behave, Roy Niederhoffer, who majored in neuroscience at Harvard, delves into psychological research.But Mr. Niederhoffer does not need much research to tell him that some investors chase winners. With his fund soaring, investors are piling on. His assets under management have climbed to $2 billion, from $700 million earlier this year.Still, Mr. Niederhoffer is not planning any celebrations.“The greatest danger at a time like this is hubris,” he said. He has banned fist-pumping victory poses on his trading floor.'"

But, he added, “subtitles are marketing devices — I hate them. I’ve always hated them.”He said that for “White Guilt,” his book before “A Bound Man,” he tried not to have a subtitle, to no avail. In that case, Mr. Steele went with another provocative subtitle: “How Blacks and Whites Together Destroyed the Promise of the Civil Rights Era.”'"
"'08-11-10,'0','NRG Energy, a power generator based in Princeton, N.J., said Sunday it had rejected an unsolicited takeover bid by Exelon, saying the offer “manifestly undervalues” the company.The rejection forestalls, at least for now, the creation of what would be the largest power company in the nation, amid a wave of consolidation in the industry. NRG left the door open for Exelon to raise its price and said it was “agnostic” about being a buyer or seller.Exelon, one of the largest nuclear plant operators in the United States, unveiled its all-stock offer on Oct. 12, valuing NRG at $6.2 billion. Since then, Exelon’s share price has slipped to $53.82, making the bid worth roughly $6.08 billion.NRG’s shares have risen 31 percent since Exelon made its offer public. They closed at $23.86 on Friday.In rejecting the deal, NRG said its share price was undervalued and complained that its shareholders would own only 17 percent of the combined company even as NRG’s business would contribute about 30 percent of the new entity’s cash flow.'"

"'08-11-11,'0','The last communication came on Nov. 2. Mr. Goldstein said the orbiting spacecraft would continue to listen for a few more weeks on the faint chance that the Phoenix defies their expectations.The Phoenix landed in May to examine the northern arctic plains, and the $428 million mission, originally scheduled to last three months, was extended twice“I’m just thrilled to death what we’ve been able to do here,” said Peter H. Smith of the University of Arizona, the mission’s principal investigator. The spacecraft accomplished all of its main objectives, but some science remained unfinished. The Martian soil proved to be extremely clumpy, and the spacecraft had recurrent trouble getting the samples through gratings into the spacecraft’s laboratory apparatus.Dr. Smith admitted disappointment that a sample from one of the trenches that the Phoenix had dug was never successfully analyzed. “We got it all the way up to the instrument and even tried pressing it down,” Dr. Smith said. “But it wouldn’t go in.”But Dr. Smith highlighted what the Phoenix did discover. It confirmed a layer of ice not far below the surface. It found some carbonates and clays, which suggest that liquid water may have be present within the past few millennia. It found the arctic soil to be alkaline, not acidic as has been observed in other parts of Mars. It also discovered perchlorates, a class of chemicals that in high concentrations can be toxic to life, but which can also serve as a food source for some microbes.The spacecraft took 25,000 photographs, including panoramas of the landing and microscopic images of dust particles.“It’s really an Irish wake, not a funeral that we’re looking forward to,” said Douglas McCuiston, director of the Mars Exploration Program at NASA headquarters. “NASA got what it wanted out of this mission.”The data may yet reveal the presence of carbon-based molecules that could be building blocks for life, Dr. Smith said, and that the region might, at least occasionally, be suitable for life. The Phoenix was not designed to look directly for signs of life. Dr. Smith said the scientists had begun writing the scientific articles describing their findings.In the coming months, when sunlight disappears entirely in the northern plains, temperatures will fall to minus-240 to minus-300 degrees Fahrenheit, and the Phoenix will become encased within carbon dioxide ice. When spring returns, NASA plans to try reviving the Phoenix again, but the expectation is that the spacecraft’s electronics will not survive the long, deep freeze.'"
"'08-11-11,'0','In January 2006, 13 jurors from two of the sailors’ trials signed letters and affidavits saying they now believed the men were innocent.The sailors initially confessed to the crime after being threatened with the death penalty if they did not cooperate. But they quickly recanted. Three of the four — Derek Tice, Danial Williams and Joseph Dick Jr. — are serving life sentences in Virginia prisons for the rape and murder. A fourth man, Eric Wilson, was released in 2005 after serving eight and a half years for the rape conviction.After the sailors were arrested, another man, Omar Ballard, confessed that he committed the crimes. His DNA matched evidence from the scene, while none of the arrested sailors, who numbered seven at one point, had DNA that matched the evidence.Mr. Ballard had a history of violence against women in the Norfolk neighborhood where the victim, Michelle Moore-Bosko lived. Mr. Ballard was convicted in her rape and murder, along with two other sexual assaults in her neighborhood.The former agents, 26 of whom sent the governor a letter in July calling for a pardon for the sailors, said the forensic and crime scene evidence showed that only one person sexually assaulted and killed the victim. Mr. Ballard knew the victim and her husband because they had opened the door to their apartment and rescued him when he was being chased by a crowd of men in reaction to an assault on a woman about two weeks before Ms. Moore-Bosko was killed.“We are not bleeding hearts, and we don’t take this type of public action lightly,” said Mr. Cochran, who, like the other dozen agents gathered at a Richmond hotel for a news conference, was wearing a blue button that said “Free the Norfolk Four.” “However, we also believe that law enforcement has an obligation to protect the most innocent from wrongful conviction.”Ms. Moore-Bosko’s mother, Carol Moore of Pittsburgh, could not be reached for comment.But in a statement in January, she said: “Derek Tice and the Norfolk Four confessed to the rape and murder of our daughter. These men are guilty and we pray that our family will not have to suffer through any more appeals.”The governor’s office declined to comment on the case except to say that it was still reviewing the clemency petition.George H. Kendall, a lawyer helping with the pardon effort, said that in all likelihood police investigators elicited one false confession and used it and the threat of the death penalty to set off a “domino effect,” resulting in the others.Serious inconsistencies suggested the confessions were not legitimate, the agents said. The accounts did not mesh with the evidence. The tidy appearance of Ms. Moore-Bosko’s apartment and pattern of her wounds suggested a single assailant, not seven, as the police originally contended. The stories of the four men contradicted one another. Above all, the police found no physical evidence tying the four sailors, a least one of whom lived in Ms. Moore-Bosko’s neighborhood, to the murder scene.In early 1999, when seven men were in jail awaiting trial in the killing of Ms. Moore-Bosko, Mr. Ballard wrote a letter from prison bragging to a friend that he had committed the crime. He provided a detailed account of the killing and insisted that he had acted alone.By then, Mr. Williams had pleaded guilty, with an agreement that he would not receive the death penalty. He was not allowed to withdraw his plea. Mr. Dick had made a plea bargain in exchange for testimony against Mr. Tice. Mr. Tice had given a tape-recorded confession, although some details he provided about the crime were inaccurate. Mr. Wilson was charged only with rape.The other three sailors did not confess, and charges against them were eventually dismissed.“The governor is really the only person in a position to see the entirety of the evidence regarding these men,” Mr. Kendall said, noting that each defendant had been tried separately.Moreover, he said the jurors and judges during the trials never heard that the detective who had elicited the confessions had been reprimanded before for having elicited false ones. They also did not hear about Mr. Ballard’s history of sexual assaults in Ms. Moore-Bosko’s neighborhood.Shaking her head, Rhea Williams, the mother of Danial Williams, said she found it encouraging but emotionally exhausting to hear the F.B.I. agents present their views on the case. As she went to get coffee for her 14-hour drive back to Owosso, Mich., her eyes filled with tears.“The only problem with these things,” Ms. Williams said, “is that we still have to go home without our boys.”'"
"'08-11-11,'0','One of the few college presidents speaking publicly about making some adjustment is Douglas Bennett of Earlham College in Indiana. About 18 percent of its students are from families with less than $60,000 in income and receive financial aid.“If you are truly need-blind, you can go broke,” Mr. Bennett said bluntly during a telephone interview. “It is like writing a blank check to the world.”The relative share of financial aid that is picked up by the government is declining as well, he added. As the burden is shifted to families and institutions, Earlham is trying to figure out what to do. The college is particularly concerned about students that it accepts and enrolls but whose financial needs it may not be able to meet.Mr. Bennett said Earlham, which had a $350 million endowment at the end of June, was considering limiting its need-blind admissions policy to three-quarters of the class. The college would then know how much it had committed in financial aid and would be able to take that into account in admitting the remaining 25 percent.Endowment management at most colleges involves a “smoothing strategy” that tries to blend spending over good years and bad in the hope of avoiding abrupt layoffs or other cuts if the endowment falls precipitously.Though endowments generally pay out about 5 percent of their assets annually, they often calculate the amount on an average of the previous three years, or other formulas. So in a rising market, colleges appear to be giving away less than 5 percent of the current endowment value; in a falling market, they appear to be giving away more.A prolonged bear market would be likely to depress returns or even create more losses. Contributions from alumni might also decline, putting even more pressure on endowments just as the colleges need more financing from them.For the moment, colleges with heftier endowments say they can weather the storms. In late October, Anthony Marx, president of Amherst College, posted a letter on the college Web site that said the endowment had fallen 25 percent since June 30, the end of fiscal 2008, when it stood at $1.7 billion. Still, Mr. Marx wrote, the commitment to financial aid would not be scaled back, although Amherst would postpone a renovation project and would review plans for new hires more stringently.But the new financial realities mean that “every school is looking at what they can cut and what they can reallocate,” said Steven Rattner, a managing principal of the Quadrangle Group and acting chairman of Brown University’s investment committee.“Nobody thinks the market will turn around and go back to do what it did before,” he said. “That means everyone is having to plan for a more difficult and turbulent financial environment to bring our expenses in line with resources.”Everywhere, the goal is to keep entry to colleges accessible. “Just as schools have less money, the families need more,” Mr. Rattner said. “While they are all looking to trim fat, the needs-blind issue is seen as muscle.”As part of a $1.4 billion fund-raising campaign, Brown is seeking $400 million for financial aid. Ronald Vanden Dorpel, senior vice president for advancement, said the university tells potential donors that such gifts let Brown admit the best and most diverse students — “whomever we want without looking at their ability to pay.”During freshman weekend at Williams last month, Mr. Schapiro told families that if their financial circumstances had changed, the college wanted to know and would try to accommodate their needs.The college has 2,000 students, and “I got about 12 calls from families that told us they might need more help,” said Mr. Schapiro, who is also president of the 568 Presidents’ Group, 30 colleges that have agreed to admit all American students on a needs-blind basis.Mr. Schapiro has already alerted the Williams community about other cutbacks. In a letter several weeks ago, he said the endowment budget had been predicated on an annual increase over the long term of 8 percent; last year, Williams’s endowment was down one-tenth of 1 percent. He also warned that Williams would have to think about the impact of the roiling economy on giving.Williams has decided to delay the completion of a sports field and a library. That will save money, Mr. Schapiro said, and avoid the need to borrow. In the current credit crunch, he noted, “the preferential interest rates once afforded to schools are temporarily gone.”“We have invested in things such as housing and psychological services,” he said. “And we are going to have to allow attrition to give up some staff. The days of adding lots more staff for these purposes are over.”In California, Stanford University is looking at 5 percent cuts across the board, slashing $45 million from its $800 million basic operating budget, according to Lisa Lapin, a campus spokeswoman. She said that Stanford was planning on modest and selective salary increases next year but that its commitment to financial aid was firm, even as requests for it rise.Roughly half of Stanford’s $120 million in financial aid, which helps 77 percent of the undergraduate body, came from the endowment in fiscal 2007, Ms. Lapin said, and maintaining access to Stanford for top students, regardless of costs, remains a top priority.'"
"'08-11-11,'0','Food and Friends, a Washington-based group that delivers meals to local residents who are seriously ill, has 20 years’ experience with special-event fund-raising and last year used it to raise $1.6 million.Its events ranged from Chef’s Best — an auction and tasting menu featuring prominent regional chefs that took in $650,000 — to an exclusive evening of shopping at Crate and Barrel, which donated 10 percent of the proceeds. Another special event is Slice of Life, a Thanksgiving pie sale introduced last year that generated $100,000 for the organization.Among those who bought the pies, which cost the charity $6.32 each and sold for $25 or $35, were many people who had never donated to Food and Friends and who may initially have been more interested in the product than the cause, said Craig Shniderman, the group’s executive director. But by building awareness of the charity’s work and a connection with a large pool of potential new donors, the sale could generate much larger contributions, he said. The charity plans to expand its pie program by 75 percent this year.Neil Griffin, whose Washington-based marketing firm bought 60 pies to give to his clients as holiday gifts last year, has acquired through Food and Friends two Coton de Tuléar puppies for his mother. He won the first at the organization’s 2006 auction; the second dog he bought this year directly from the breeder, who gave the proceeds to Food and Friends.Mr. Griffin said he paid $4,000 for each dog, which he said would normally sell for less than half that amount, but he added that “it was money very well spent.”Advocates of special-events fund-raising like Bob Levey, a former Washington Post columnist who has been the auctioneer at about 2,000 charity auctions, say that even in a down economy people may continue to open their wallets for a unique item, a memorable experience or a rare chance to brush shoulders with a celebrity.One of the highlights of Mr. Levey’s sideline career was auctioning off a round of golf with Bill Clinton in 1996, which reportedly went for $76,000, to benefit Sidwell Friends School in Washington, where the Clintons’ daughter, Chelsea, was a student at the time.When bidding at the silent auction to benefit Public School 321 in Park Slope, Brooklyn, David Gmach, who has two children at the school, chooses gift certificates for restaurants that his family would like to try, or neighborhood stores that they frequent anyway. To benefit a good cause, he is willing to pay nominally more than the face value of the certificates, he said.In such cases, the charitable income-tax deduction is limited to the difference between what the buyer pays and what the item is worth, said Laura Peebles, a director in the national office at Deloitte Tax in Washington. “Most auction buyers aren’t entitled to a tax deduction because they’re getting a good deal,” she said.For example, Pam Zaragoza, a real estate agent in Burlingame, Calif., who recently bid $20,000 at a local school district auction for a luxury bathroom renovation, figures she bought goods and services worth double that amount. The package included an architect and contractor, a custom-made vanity and a stone slab to top it, most of the tile and a $1,500 store credit on a shower door.Ms. Zaragoza, who is paying extra for the fixtures and medicine cabinets, said she was “not in a financial position” to make a $20,000 donation to the school district without getting anything in return.To make sure she was the successful bidder, Ms. Zaragoza paid the “get it now price” at the school’s online auction. It was hosted by Bidding for Good, part of cMarket, a five-year-old company in Cambridge, Mass., that supplies charities with the technology to run auctions and other online sales, in exchange for 3 to 9 percent of the proceeds.Charities can choose to limit access to their own supporters or, as most do, open the auction to other bidders, who can shop by charity or by product category at biddingforgood.com.“The beauty of an auction is that it draws money out of the consumer-spending wallet,” which is larger than the pool of money families and individuals earmark for charity, said Jon Carson, chief executive of cMarket.Jeffrey M. Wallace, a graphic designer, art collector and patron of the Brooklyn Academy of Music, says he has found many buying opportunities at the academy’s annual online art auction, spending $40,000 during the past three years. His most recent acquisition was a Jasper Johns silk screen, which he said he bought last spring for $19,000.For this piece, and others acquired the same way, Mr. Wallace said the prices he paid were within the range of what the art might have commanded at a for-profit auction. But, he added, he had access to pieces that were donated by local galleries and might not have been for sale elsewhere.This holiday season, Jolyne Caruso, a financial adviser who helped organize Barnard’s gala and auction last spring, plans to shop though Charity Folks, another online auctioneer, which specializes in goods and services donated by celebrities. For example, instead of buying theater tickets for her parents at the box office, Ms. Caruso plans to bid for them at an auction on Charityfolks.com. Charity Folks charges nonprofits a 20 percent commission on all sales.Not everyone is enthusiastic about transaction-based giving, however. Generally speaking, the costs associated with publicizing and administering special events make them less cost effective for charities than “virtually any other fund-raising tactic,” said Patrick M. Rooney, director of research at the Center on Philanthropy at Indiana University.A recent survey by the center found that fund-raisers thought the effectiveness of special events declined “precipitously” with the softening economy, to 59.4 percent holding that view last summer, from 71.1 percent in December of last year, he said.And in contrast with in-person events that provide an opportunity to educate participants about a charity’s mission, strictly transactional fund-raising is “probably not a good way of cultivating donors” even if it raises money in the short run, Mr. Rooney said. “What’s the difference between this and Wal-Mart at that point?”'"
"'08-11-11,'0','“Good, constructive, relaxed and friendly,” said the White House press secretary, Dana Perino, summarizing Mr. Bush’s impressions.“It was bit of a momentous day,” Mr. Obama’s press secretary, Robert Gibbs, told reporters on the flight back to Chicago, adding that Mr. Obama found the president to be “gracious.”“I don’t know that I would characterize him as awestruck,” Mr. Gibbs said of Mr. Obama. “What he said to me is, ‘It’s a really nice office.’ ”The Obamas began their day in Chicago, traveling separately to Washington so Mrs. Obama could stay on and look at schools for the couple’s daughters, Malia, 10, and Sasha, 7. (After the White House visit, Mrs. Obama was spotted at the Georgetown Day School, one of Washington’s fanciest private schools.)The couple was due at the White House at 2 p.m., but arrived 10 minutes early, no doubt pleasing the always punctual Mr. Bush. The men were sartorially in sync in dark blue suits, white shirts and sky blue ties; after the couples posed for photographs at the South Portico, the two leaders could be seen strolling along the Colonnade, past the White House Rose Garden, pausing for a few moments before they walked through the glass doors of the Oval Office for the first of two private meetings.Mr. Bush relishes telling visitors about the office, and aides said the president gave Mr. Obama his standard tour, talking about the historic pieces — including the desk used by President John F. Kennedy, made famous when young John F. Kennedy Jr. was photographed peering out from under it — as well as the Texas-inspired artwork. The men joined their wives for a brief tour of the residence before returning to the Oval Office.Meanwhile, Mrs. Bush and Mrs. Obama, who had not met before, took a more extensive tour. For Mrs. Obama, the visit was a chance to begin working on the logistics of moving her family — including her mother, who helps look after the children. To that end, she met with one of the most important people at the White House, Adm. Stephen W. Rochon, the chief usher, who runs the mansion and oversees everything from state dinners to redecorating.Mrs. Bush showed Mrs. Obama all 33 rooms on the second and third floors, White House officials said, including the bedrooms where Malia and Sasha would most likely live, the same rooms used by the Kennedy children and Amy Carter, and by the Bush twins during weekend visits when their grandfather, the first President George Bush, occupied the White House.The affair carried the feeling of a political changing of the guard, with aides to Mr. Bush standing on the South Lawn introducing themselves to their counterparts in an Obama administration.Ms. Perino, the press secretary, took Mr. Gibbs, a longtime aide to Mr. Obama, into her office to discuss his coming role at her job. Reggie Love, the body man for Mr. Obama, received a tour of his own from Mr. Bush’s assistant, and several other young aides were shown around the West Wing.A sense of anticipation extended beyond 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. As the Obamas’ limousine made its way to the White House, hundreds of people lined the streets, craning their necks to see. When the door opened and the couple stepped out to greet the Bushes, there was an unfamiliar sound: cheering outside the White House gates.'"
"'08-11-11,'0','THE Bridgespan Group, which offers management consulting services to philanthropic and nonprofit organizations, has introduced a Web site that will make a broad array of its resources freely available online.The site, bridgespan.org, is organized into six interactive sections called learning centers. Each learning center focuses on an area of nonprofit organization and management like strategy, recruiting and hiring and financing. The material includes articles, videos, podcasts and question-and-answer series.There are what Bridgespan calls conversation starters — essays on broad policy questions facing the nonprofit sector. And there is a library of case studies, drawn from consulting work done by Bridgespan since its founding in 2000. At another site, Bridgestar.org, there is a jobs board for those seeking work in nonprofit management.Bridgespan aims to be a “trusted source of knowledge and best practices,” said Jeff Bradach, its managing partner. To that end, it includes not only its own materials, but also links to management-related content from other groups.The goal is “a one-stop shop for issues of management and leadership and strategy for organizations in the nonprofit sector and philanthropies,” Mr. Bradach said.'"
"'08-11-11,'0','At the finance meeting, the authority’s chief financial officer, Gary J. Dellaverson, said that the nation’s crippling economic crisis was quickly eroding the tax revenues that had once been a key factor in the authority’s financial well-being.In 2007, the authority took in nearly $1.6 billion from taxes on mortgages and other real estate transactions. This year, he said, the authority expects to receive slightly less than $1 billion from those taxes. Next year the number is projected to shrink to $895 million. Both of those forecasts represent significant reductions from what the authority expected when it made its initial budget proposal in July.Taxes on corporations are also slipping. A tax on corporate profits is expected to bring in $175 million less next year than originally predicted. That alone accounts for more than half of the growth in the authority’s deficit.The authority’s original budget plan called for a series of measures intended to close what it predicted then as a $900 million gap.Those included more than $200 million in additional aid from the state and the city, which Mr. Sander acknowledged on Monday would not be forthcoming because the state and the city were also facing deep budget cuts.The preliminary budget also called for an 8 percent increase in fare and toll revenues, starting in July, which would generate an additional $200 million.Each 1 percent increase in fare and toll revenues would generate slightly more than $4 million in income each month.The deepening crisis raised the stakes for a state panel created last spring by Gov. David A. Paterson to recommend a solution to the authority’s chronic financial woes. The commission, led by Richard Ravitch, a former authority chairman, is to make its recommendations in early December.The recommendations could include new taxes to help finance the authority’s day-to-day operations, as well as its long-term capital spending on things like new buses and subway and rail cars, subway station renovations and system expansion projects like the Second Avenue subway. The authority is due to begin a new five-year capital plan in 2010, but there is no clear financing mechanism for that plan, which could approach $30 billion.“The numbers that were discussed this morning demonstrate the gravity of the situation,” Mr. Ravitch said. “That is why we’re working very diligently to come up with a comprehensive capital and operating plan for the M.T.A., because not to deal with it, and deal with it as soon as possible, would create a lot of uncertainty and perhaps results that are very adverse to the public.”The panel has also considered a proposal to collect tolls on the free bridges over the East River as a way to raise money for the authority. Mr. Ravitch said the commission has not yet finalized its recommendations.Assemblyman Richard L. Brodsky, a Democrat from Westchester County who is the chairman of a commission that oversees the authority, said he was worried that the authority’s long-term spending needs would be forgotten in a discussion of its more immediate fiscal woes.“You look back at the generation of leaders in the ’60s and ’70s and say, ‘How could they let the subway system deteriorate as much as it did?’ ” Mr. Brodsky said. “We are going to be faced with precisely the choices that they faced.” He added, “The real question here is do we repeat those mistakes?”Governor Paterson, who is seeking to cut the state’s budget, issued a statement on Monday saying that meeting the authority’s fiscal challenges “will require shared sacrifice, difficult choices and cooperation from all funding partners.”'"
"'08-11-11,'0','Inside the pyramid, sitting on a comfortable white couch near a mummified Doberman named Butch, Ron Temu, a Summum counselor, said the two monuments would complement each other.“They’ve put a basically Judeo-Christian religious text in the park, which we think is great, because people should be exposed to it,” Mr. Temu said. “But our principles should be exposed as well.”Su Menu, the church’s president, agreed. “If you look at them side by side,” Ms. Menu said of the two monuments, “they really are saying similar things.”The Third Commandment: “Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain.”The Third Aphorism: “Nothing rests; everything moves; everything vibrates.”Michael W. Daniels, the mayor here, is not the vibrating sort.Sitting with the city attorney in a conference room in City Hall, Mr. Daniels deftly drew several fine lines in explaining why the city could treat the two monuments differently.Only donations concerning the city’s history are eligible for display in the park as a matter of longstanding policy, he said, and only when donated by groups with a long association with the city. The Fraternal Order of Eagles, a national civic organization, donated the Ten Commandments monument in 1971.The donations, Mr. Daniels went on, are transformed when the city accepts them. “Monuments on government property become government speech,” he said.Under the First Amendment, the government can generally say what it likes without giving equal time to opposing views; it has much less latitude to choose among private speakers.Asked what the government is saying when it displays the Ten Commandments, Mr. Daniels talked about law and history. He did not mention religion.“The fact that we own the monument doesn’t mean that what is on the monument is something we are espousing, promoting, establishing, embracing,” Mr. Daniels said. “We’re looking at, Does it fit with the heritage of the people of this area?”Brian M. Barnard, a lawyer for the Summum church, said the city’s distinctions were cooked up after the fact as a way to reject his client’s monument. The local chapter of the Eagles, Mr. Barnard added, had only been in town two years when it donated the Ten Commandments monument.“We have a city that will allow one organization to put up its religious ideals and principles,” Mr. Barnard said. “When the next group comes along, they won’t allow it to put up its religious ideals and principles.”Last year, the federal appeals court in sided with the Summum church and ordered Pleasant Grove City to erect its monument.Although the case appears to present questions under the First Amendment’s ban on government establishment of religion, the appeals court said the case was properly analyzed under the amendment’s free-speech protections. That distinguishes it from most cases concerning the display of nativity scenes and the like on government property.The city, supported by more than 20 cities and states, along with the federal government, has told the Supreme Court that the upshot of affirming the appeals court decision would be to clutter public parks across the nation with offensive nonsense.A town accepting a Sept. 11 memorial would also have to display a donated tribute to , the briefs said. “Accepting a Statue of Liberty,” the city’s brief said, should not “compel a government to accept a Statue of Tyranny.”The brief for the Summum church said the relevant dispute was much narrower. “The government,” it said, “may not take sides in a theological debate.”Governments seeking to avoid accepting donations they do not want have several options, the Summum brief contended. They can choose to display nothing. They can speak in their own voice by creating or commissioning their own monuments. And they can adopt the messages conveyed by donated monuments as their own, but only if they do so expressly and unequivocally.The Ten Commandments monument here stands in Pioneer Park, which pays tribute to the city’s frontier heritage, one that is mostly Mormon. The two sides differ about how best to honor that heritage.Mayor Daniels said the monument broadly reflected local history. Mr. Barnard, the Summum lawyer, said the Ten Commandments did not play a central role in the Mormon faith. “If they wanted to quote from the Book of Mormon,” he said, “that would, at least, relate to the pioneers.”“Mormons came to Utah because of religious persecution,” Mr. Barnard added. “The pioneer heritage in Utah has to be escape from persecution.”The Summum church was founded in 1975, and it contains elements of Egyptian faiths and Gnostic Christianity. “Summum,” derived from the Latin, refers to the sum of all creation.Followers of Summum believe that Moses received two sets of tablets on Mount Sinai and that the Ten Commandments were on the second set. The aphorisms were on the first one.“When Moses came down from the mountain the first time, he brought the principles of creation,” Mr. Temu said. “But he saw the people weren’t ready for them, so he threw them on the ground and destroyed them.”Summum’s founder, Corky Ra, says he learned the aphorisms during a series of telepathic encounters with divine beings he called Summa Individuals.Mr. Barnard has represented the Summum church for many years. “They’re odd,” he said of his clients, with an affectionate smile. “They’re strange. They’re different.”Bernie Aua, the church’s vice president, said the court case should not turn on how his religion was viewed.“We have this thing called the Constitution,” Mr. Aua said. “The fact is, it’s a public park. And public parks are public.”'"
"'08-11-11,'0','On the other hand, she writes, despite the talk that deflation — a period of declining prices — may occur sometime in the near future, most business are facing rising costs, especially if they purchase commodities. That, she says, gives them “every right to pass along these increases” to their customers.Given recessionary pressure on one hand, and rising operating expenses on the other, Ms. Murray says she chooses raising prices. “If people see the value in your product or service, they will keep buying.”MORE THAN HIGHER PRICES For small businesses worried that a price increase will drive away customers, Entrepreneur magazine says there is a way to gain the benefits of a price increase without actually charging more.“Prices don’t exist in a vacuum. Like the earth under your feet, a price is supported by the value the customer perceives in the product or service to which the price is attached. Thinking about price and value in this way makes it clear that this is at least a two-dimensional problem. That is, you can change the pricing and leave the value alone, or you can change the value and leave the pricing alone.”Food companies are the perfect example of this. They often leave the price unchanged, but give you less. Coffee used to be sold in 16-ounce containers but is now sold in 13-ounce cans at the price companies used to charge for a full pound.A similar business analogy may be to keep your prices the same, but have lower-priced people — senior associates, instead of partners — do the work.HEDGE YOUR BETS If you are going to raise your prices, set them higher than you have to, suggests Karen E. Klein, writing on businessweek.com.That way, if your customers balk, you can reduce the price increase a bit and still end up with the increase you need.Here’s an example — ours — of how that might work.Suppose you want to raise prices 8 percent. You would announce a price increase of 10 percent, knowing that if customers object, you could offer them “special terms” of some sort that reduces the actual increase to the 8 percent increase you want.And, of course, if no one objected, you would keep the full 10 percent.LAST CALL With his tongue only partly planted in his cheek, Hesh Reinfeld suggests that if you want to get more from your marketing spending, learn to hate your customers.Mr. Reinfeld, a small-business consultant who also writes a humor column, says that his “success is tied to being able to serve as many clients as possible.” But he adds, “There are only 24 hours in a day. By analyzing my work schedule and those of my employees, I found that we spent way too much time with clients we liked.”Mr. Reinfeld said he found that for every hour of billable work, he and his staff spent another, nonbillable hour talking to clients they liked about their children or playing golf.“These people made great potential friends but terrible clients,” he says. “I usually lost money on each one of those consulting contracts. On the other hand, when I despised a client, I’d do the work, and then get out of his office. I didn’t ask any questions about the boar head on the wall or the photo of him bicycling with the president at what looked like Camp David.”And he turned a profit as a result.'"
"'08-11-11,'0','In Dr. Lander’s view, the “kluges upon kluges” are an occupational hazard. “We’re trying to parse an incredibly complex system,” he said. “It’s like the U.S. economy. What are your functional units? Employees and employers? Consumers and producers? What if you’re a freelancer with multiple employers? Where do farmers’ markets and eBay map onto your taxonomy?”“You shouldn’t be worried about the fact that you have to layer on other things as you go along,” he said. “You can never capture something like an economy, a genome or an ecosystem with one model or one taxonomy — it all depends on the questions you want to ask.”Dr. Lander added: “You have to be able to say, this is Tuesday’s simplification; Wednesday’s may be different, because incredible progress has been made by those simplifications.”For other researchers, though, the parlance of molecular biology is desperately in need of an overhaul, starting with our folksy friend, gene. “The language is historical baggage,” said Evelyn Fox Keller, a science historian and professor emeritus at M.I.T. “It comes from the expectation that if we could find the fundamental units that make stuff happen, if we could find the atoms of biology, then we would understand the process.”“But the notion of the gene as the atom of biology is very mistaken,” said Dr. Keller, author of “The Century of the Gene” and other books. “DNA does not come equipped with genes. It comes with sequences that are acted on in certain ways by cells. Before you have cells you don’t have genes. We have to get away from the underlying assumption of the particulate units of inheritance that we seem so attached to.”Dr. Keller is a big fan of the double helix considered both in toto and in situ — in its native cellular setting. “DNA is an enormously powerful resource, the most brilliant invention in evolutionary history,” she said. “It is a far richer and more interesting molecule than we could have imagined when we first started studying it.”Still, she said, “it doesn’t do anything by itself.” It is a profoundly relational molecule, she said, and it has meaning only in the context of the cell. To focus endlessly on genes, she said, keeps us stuck in a linear, unidirectional and two-dimensional view of life, in which instructions are read out and dutifully followed.“What makes DNA a living molecule is the dynamics of it, and a dynamic vocabulary would be helpful,” she said. “I talk about trying to verb biology.” And to renoun it as well. Writing last year in the journal PloS One, Dr. Keller and David Harel of the Weizmann Institute of Science suggested as an alternative to gene the word dene, which they said could be used to connote any DNA sequence that plays a role in the cell. So far, Dr. Keller admits, it has yet to catch on.Complex as our genome is, it obviously can be comprehended: our cells do it every day. Yet as the physician and essayist Lewis Thomas once noted, his liver was much smarter than he was, and he would rather be asked to pilot a 747 jet 40,000 feet over Denver than to assume control of his liver. “Nothing would save me or my liver, if I were in charge,” he wrote.In a similar vein, we may never understand the workings of our cells and genomes as comfortably and cockily as we understand the artifacts of our own design. “We have evolved to solve problems,” Dr. Keller said. “Those do not include an understanding of the operation of our own systems — that doesn’t have much evolutionary advantage.” It’s quite possible, she said, that biology is “irreducibly complex,” and not entirely accessible to rational analysis. Which is not to say we’re anywhere near being stymied, she said: “Our biology is stretching our minds. It’s another loop in the evolutionary process.”And if canonical genes are too thin a gruel to explain yourself to yourself, you can always reach for the stalwart of scapegoats. Blame it all on your mother, who surely loved you too much or too little or in all the wrong ways.'"
"'08-11-11,'0','American Express, the nation’s last big independent credit card company, said late Monday that it would transform into a bank holding company to strengthen its position in the market turmoil.Federal Reserve banking regulators said they approved its application because of the “unusual and exigent circumstances” roiling financial markets and the company’s interest in tapping up to $3.8 billion in government money. As a full-fledged bank, American Express would gain greater access to the Treasury Department’s bailout plan for banks, a move that might allow it to lend more freely and perhaps acquire a larger deposit-taking institution.American Express customers are unlikely to notice the changes. But Monday’s announcement may also represent the end of financial companies operating a single line of business and depending on the capital markets for financing.Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley recently transformed themselves from investment banks to bank holding companies after being battered by the markets. Big lenders like GMAC, the finance company partly owned by General Motors, and General Electric’s financial subsidiary have similarly been considering becoming banks.American Express executives have publicly maintained they did not need to become a bank holding company, although they also never completely ruled out that option. But when their financing costs soared as the commercial paper markets froze , the company increasingly recognized it needed to diversify its sources of financing. The company applied for banking holding company status about two or three weeks ago, according to a person with direct knowledge of the situation.Federal Reserve regulators sped up American Express’s request because of the market turbulence and the company’s desire to apply for the government investment program, which had a Nov. 14 deadline. Typically, the process can take 45 days or more; American Express got its license in about half that time.'"
"'08-11-11,'0','People who survive a heart attack are at much higher risk of sudden cardiac death in the next 30 days, researchers have found.The findings, which appeared in the Nov. 5 Journal of the American Medical Association, suggest that doctors need to closely supervise patients in the month after a heart attack, and that patients also need to be alert to signs of trouble.“The first month after a heart attack can be envisioned as a period of healing with heart tissue remodeling, which conceptually is associated with a propensity to experience sudden death,” one of the authors, Dr. Véronique L. Roger of the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., said in an e-mail message.The researchers, led by Dr. A. Selcuk Adabag of the Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Minneapolis, followed the health of almost 3,000 people who had a heart attack from 1979 to 2005.In the first 30 days, they found, the rate of sudden cardiac death was 1.2 percent, about four times the risk that would have been expected in the general population, once age and sex were taken into account.But the rate improved greatly over the following 11 months, dropping to a level lower than that usually seen in the general population.'"
"'08-11-11,'0','Meanwhile, analysts said, its archrival, Best Buy, secured better real estate, offered better service and adapted more quickly to a difficult marketplace for electronic goods.Circuit City is still the nation’s second-largest dedicated consumer electronics retailer after Best Buy, with more than 700 stores. Last week it said it would close 155 of them, open fewer new ones, renegotiate some leases and cut staff members at its headquarters.The retailer had been limping along for months, its shares losing more than 90 percent of their value since the beginning of the year. Sales for the three months ending in August fell 13.3 percent.No liquidation of Circuit City is imminent; the company filed under provisions of the bankruptcy code that would allow it to keep operating while it revamped and sought fresh financing. James A. Marcum, vice chairman and acting president and chief executive of Circuit City Stores, said Monday that the company intended to live on beyond Christmas and to emerge stronger than before. He said the public could have confidence in doing business with the company.“The decision to restructure the business ... should provide us with the opportunity to strengthen our balance sheet, create a more efficient expense structure and ultimately position the company to compete more effectively,” he said.Most electronic products sold at Circuit City and other stores are backed by manufacturers’ warranties. Circuit City said it would continue to accept returns as before and to honor its add-on warranties, which were secured by third-party financial institutions, and its gift cards.While Circuit City’s troubles mean that Best Buy can gain additional market share, that company will face stiff competition. Discount stores like Wal-Mart and Costco and the online retailer Amazon.com have become significant players in electronics sales.Even in the best of economies, electronics is a difficult business. For one, the clock is ticking the moment a piece of technology hits the shelf. The more time passes, the more its value depreciates. Second, unlike a few years ago, it is not hard to sell a flat-panel television set anymore, said David A. Schick, an analyst at Stifel Nicolaus. Consumers are familiar with the features and many would rather sacrifice expert sales advice for a bargain at Wal-Mart or an Internet retailer.In a down economy, only the best electronics operators survive.“Every time the consumer has a hiccup or a slowdown, an electronics player goes bankrupt,” said Mr. Schick, ticking off bygone names like Crazy Eddie and CompUSA.David J. Urban, a professor of marketing at Virginia Commonwealth University’s business school in Richmond, where Circuit City has its headquarters, said that making job cuts just before Christmas indicated Circuit City’s dire financial situation.“The question is how much longer after that are they going to be able to survive?” he said. “If you have to do this to be able to ensure you’ll have adequate merchandise for the holiday season and its already the 10th of November, it’s not good.”Stephen Hoch, a professor of marketing and the director of the Jay H. Baker Retailing Initiative at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, said it had become hard for retailers “to shrink dramatically and gracefully.” Many that get into trouble, he said, end up disappearing.'"
"'08-11-11,'0','General Motors shares lost 23 percent of their value after a Deutsche Bank analyst downgraded the company’s stock to sell and said G.M. shares were basically worthless. Stock in G.M., which was trading at $24 a share at the beginning of the year, closed Monday at $3.36, its lowest close in decades.Large banks joined the decline, as Citigroup closed down 5.16 percent and Bank of America fell 4.93 percent.Shares of the insurance giant American International Group rose 17 cents, or 8 percent, after an announcement that the federal government was buying $40 billion in preferred stock and restructuring the company’s bailout. Neel T. Kashkari, interim assistant secretary of the Treasury, called the move “necessary to maintain the stability of our financial system.”Financial companies led the race to the bottom, with Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs taking two of the biggest hits. Shares of Morgan fell 8.8 percent to $14.58, and Goldman lost 8.5 percent to close at $71.21 a share after an analyst at Barclays Capital warned that Goldman could post its first quarterly loss this year.Twenty of the Dow’s 30 blue chips closed lower. The only major sectors to gain were transportation, energy and materials.“The negatives overwhelmed the positives more on a psychological basis than reality,” said David Katz, chief investment officer of Matrix Asset Advisors. “In this market, weakness begets weakness.”Analysts were divided on the effect of China’s pledge to pump a half a trillion dollars into infrastructure projects. Some said that China would have spent similar sums, crisis or no crisis, while others said the move could bump up China’s gross domestic product by 2 percent.“This is a fundamentally a good sign that shows that this government is trying to bring them out of the malaise the world’s found,” Ryan Detrick, an analyst at Schaeffer’s Investment Research, said. “It does show that there’s some confidence.”Financial markets in Asia and Europe seemed to welcome the news on Monday. The major European indexes all finished positive, though they gave up many of their early gains.But by Tuesday morning, the outlook was clouded as shares on Japan’s Nikkei index closed 3.4 percent lower.Barry Ritholtz, the chief executive of Fusion IQ, a research and investment firm, said that Wall Street’s response to the Chinese plan was true to form: an exuberant first glance, followed by a dubious second look.“The initial reaction was, ‘Whee, all this money,’ and then people thought, ‘Not so much,’ ” Mr. Ritholtz said. “That happens all the time, and very often the relief rally gives way, and you get a very different read on things.”Crude-oil prices briefly dipped below $60 a barrel in New York before rebounding to close up $1.37 to $62.41. Gold also closed higher in New York trading to end at $746.20 an ounce, up $9.55. The dollar lost minor ground to the euro and yen.The benchmark 10-year Treasury bill rose 13/32, to 102 2/32, and the yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, was 3.74 percent, down from 3.79 percent on Friday.'"

"'08-11-12,'0','“The cultural significance of the plate lunch is that it illustrates Hawaii as a special place where all of our mixed cultures share their foods with one another,” said Matthew Gray, who runs Hawaii Food Tours, which ferries tourists to Oahu’s plate lunch outlets and other lesser known haunts. “Instead of referring to Hawaii as a melting pot, I prefer to call us a salad bowl, where we all get to share and showcase the individual flavors, aromas and histories of our food.”The Hawaiian plate lunch traces its roots to the 1880s, when giant fruit and sugar companies controlled much of the local economy. Among other factors, the decimation of the local population by disease made the companies desperate for plantation workers, and they drew a labor pool from China, Japan, Portugal, the Philippines and other areas.For workers who toiled under harsh conditions, lunchtime was a respite, with hearty portions of rice matched with whatever meat was left over from dinner the night before.“The workers would take their bento in these little tins,” said Kaui Philpotts, the former food editor of The Honolulu Advertiser, who has written books about Hawaiian food.“They didn’t eat sandwiches or things like that,” Ms. Philpotts said, “it was leftover rice and a lot of things like canned meat or teriyaki or cold meat or maybe scrambled eggs or pickles, and almost no salad or vegetable.”Macaroni, a later addition, seemed to bridge many national tastes and, slick with mayonnaise and a dab of salt and pepper, mixes well with a gravy-covered slab of meat.After the plantation days ended, the plate lunch lived on. In the 1960s, it moved into lunch wagons, which took meals to workers putting up buildings and conducting other forms of day labor, with little time for lunch.Enter next the holes in the wall and other stand-alone plate lunch restaurants, followed by chains that eventually expanded into Los Angeles and other cities. More recently, the health-conscious plate lunch has surfaced, in which brown rice replaces white, salads are offered instead of macaroni and misoyaki butterfish is as common as fried pork cutlets.This summer, I enjoyed the kalua pork with sweet potato salad, and some macaroni salad made with grated onions, carrots and light mayo, at Luke’s Place, a restaurant in a plantation-style building in the tiny town of Hawi on the Big Island. “We are looking to go toward healthier but affordable,” said Mike Prine, the general manager.Kaka’ako Kitchen, a plate lunch spot in a busy Honolulu shopping center, rounds out brown rice and greens with chicken in honey-lime vinaigrette, calamari with spinach salad or wild salmon with lemon-ginger sauce. “We try to take it a little more upscale,” said Russell Siu, the owner. “We don’t want to be like every other drive-in in town.”Like, for instance, Rainbow Drive-In in Honolulu, popular among the flip-flop set and a destination on Barack Obama’s must-get-to list last summer. For less than $7 one can fill up on the teriyaki beef plate, which some like to top with chili, or the “mix, all over,” which is a plate of teriyaki beef, breaded mahi-mahi and fried chicken, smothered in brown gravy “all over.”Indeed it is the standard plate lunch that tends to draw local crowds, for its magical mix of portions (large) and price (cheap). The plate lunch is something that Americans from the mainland “sort of turn their noses up at,” Ms. Philpotts said. “Especially if they are foodies or health conscious. They look at all that cholesterol and white rice, and they just go nuts. But people here grow up eating that.”It all seems like odd fare for a man as bookmark-thin as Mr. Obama, who seems to treasure his treadmill. “I think it is really funny he still eats plate lunch,” Ms. Philpotts said. “Because he is so healthy.”But she strongly suggested — at least to my ears — that the plate lunch in part accounts for his strong showing in Hawaii. “I think it is because when he comes back here he is so cool, he just kind of slips back into local ways.”'"

"'08-11-12,'0','Among the most rattled are community bankers.“By the time they get to the community banks, there may not be enough money left,” said Edward L. Yingling, the president of the American Bankers Association. “The marketplace is looking at this so rapidly that those who have the money first may have some advantage.”Adding to the frenzy is the possibility that the next Congress and White House could change the rules further. President-elect Barack Obama has added his voice by proposing that the struggling automakers get federal aid, which could mean giving them access to the fund — something the Treasury secretary, Henry M. Paulson Jr., has resisted.Despite the line outside its door, the Treasury is not worried about running out of money, according to a senior official. It has no plans to ask lawmakers to free the second $350 billion of the rescue package during the special session of Congress that could begin next week.That could limit the pot of money available, at least until the next Congress is sworn in next January. Meanwhile, the list of candidates for a piece of the bailout keeps growing.On Monday, the Treasury announced it would inject an additional $40 billion into A.I.G., amid signs that the government’s original bailout plan was putting too much strain on the company. American Express won approval Monday to transform itself into a bank holding company, making the giant marketer of credit cards eligible for an infusion.Then there is the National Marine Manufacturers Association, which is asking whether boat financing companies might be eligible for aid to ensure that dealers have access to credit to stock their showrooms with boats — costs have gone up as the credit markets have calcified. Using much the same rationale, the National Automobile Dealers Association is pleading that car dealers get consideration, too.“Unfortunately, I don’t have a lot of good news for them individually,” said Jeb Mason, who as the Treasury’s liaison to the business community is the first port-of-call for lobbyists. “The government shouldn’t be in the business of picking winners and losers among industries.”Mr. Mason, 32, a lanky Texan in black cowboy boots who once worked in the White House for Karl Rove, shook his head over the dozens of phone calls and e-mail messages he gets every week. “I was telling a friend, ‘this must have been how the Politburo felt,’ ” he said.The Congressional bailout law gave the Treasury broad authority to decide how to spend the $700 billion. Under the terms of the $250 billion capital purchase program announced last month, cash infusions are available to “qualifying U.S. banks, savings associations, and certain bank and savings and loan holding companies, engaged only in financial activities.”That definition has grown to include private banks and insurers like Allstate and MetLife, which own savings and loans. It may also encompass industrial lenders like GE Capital and GMAC, the financing arm of General Motors, provided they win approval to reclassify themselves as a bank or savings and loan holding company.The Treasury set a deadline of Friday for institutions to apply for capital investments, which has meant a grueling few weeks for already overworked officials like Mr. Mason.“Jeb is like the customer service agent at Verizon when the power lines go down,” said Robert S. Nichols, president of the Financial Services Forum, a trade group for big institutions like Citigroup, Fidelity and Allstate Insurance, some of which have received federal money.The influential independent and community bankers group, which represents smaller institutions, won an extension of the deadline for privately held banks while the Treasury considers a way for them to participate in its program as well.The Treasury, several industry executives said, wants to avoid too strict a definition of eligible institutions, in case the Obama administration decides it wants to tweak the requirements for an investment, or even overhaul the rescue program.Several lobbyists said the Treasury’s model contract acknowledges the possibility that Congress could impose new requirements on recipients of the money, and some Democratic lawmakers have talked about further restricting executive compensation, shareholder dividends or other uses of the money as part of the deal.“We are like a tenant signing a lease contract with the landlord where the landlord can come back and change the terms after the fact, and in fact we are going to have a new landlord in a couple of weeks,” said Mr. Yingling of the bankers association.The first wave of lobbying came in early October when Mr. Paulson announced the plan to buy troubled mortgage-related assets from banks. The Treasury said it would hire several outside firms to handle the purchases, and would dispense with federal contracting rules.Law and lobbying firms that specialize in government contracting fired off dispatches to clients and potential clients explaining opportunities in the new program. Capitalizing on the surge of interest, several large firms, including Patton Boggs; Akin Gump; K&L Gates L.L.P.; Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver & Jacobson; and Alston & Bird, have set up financial rescue shops.Alston & Bird, for example, highlights its two biggest stars — former Senator Bob Dole and former Senator Tom Daschle. Mr. Dole “knows Hank Paulson very well” and has been “very helpful” with the financial rescue groups, said David E. Brown, an Alston & Bird partner involved in its effort.“And of course, Senator Daschle is national co-chair of the Obama campaign,” Mr. Brown added, noting that because Mr. Daschle is not a registered lobbyist, his involvement is limited to “high level advisory and strategic advice.”Ambac Financial Group, in the relatively obscure bond insurance business, never needed lobbyists before, said Diana Adams, a managing director. But its clients persuaded the company to hire two Washington veterans — Edward Kutler and John T. O’Rourke — who helped arrange a recent meeting with Phillip L. Swagel, an assistant Treasury secretary. “We haven’t really asked for much in the past,” Ms. Adams said.Initially, the banks reacted coolly to the prospect of the government taking direct stakes in them. They worried about restrictions on executive pay, and whether there would be a stigma attached. In conference calls with industry groups, Mr. Mason helped explain the Treasury proposal — a job he and his colleagues did well, judging by the change of heart among banks.“The biggest surprise was how quickly it went from ‘I don’t need this,’ to ‘How do I get in?’ ” said Michele A. Davis, the head of public affairs at the Treasury, who is Mr. Mason’s boss.Underscoring the many ways companies can take part in the rescue fund, the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce and other Hispanic business groups met with Mr. Paulson to push for minority contracts in asset management, legal, accounting, mortgage services and maintenance jobs, like plumbing and masonry.“They are going to need a lot of folks in minority communities that are able to service their own communities,” said David Ferreira, head of government relations for the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce.As the automakers have pushed for federal help, the trade groups for car dealerships and even boat dealerships are pressing their own cases. They argue that showrooms are feeling a squeeze between higher borrowing costs to finance their inventory and slowing consumer sales to move it out the door.“We have been encouraged by reports that Secretary Paulson is looking to broaden the program,” said Mathew Dunn, head of government relations for the National Marine Manufacturers Association.On Friday, the automobile dealers sent Mr. Paulson a letter urging him to keep them in mind.“A well-capitalized, financially sound dealer network is essential to the success of every automobile manufacturer,” wrote Annette Sykora, a car dealer in Slaton, Tex., and the chairwoman of the National Automobile Dealers Association. “Any government intervention should include provisions to preserve the viability of dealers.”Some lobbyists, Mr. Mason said, had called him even though they did not have any clients looking to get into the program or worried about its restrictions. They were merely seeking intelligence on which industries would be deemed eligible for assistance. He suspects they were representing hedge funds that wanted to trade on that information.'"
"'08-11-12,'0','On news broadcasts, Poles saw an angry Mr. Rakowski shaking his finger in the face of Lech Walesa, the Solidarity leader.Less than a year later, Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski, the de facto head of government, imposed martial law to crush Solidarity. Thousands were arrested without charge and more than 100 were killed.Mr. Rakowski defended the “state of war,” which lasted until July 1983, as necessary to forestall the Soviets from invading to re-establish order.Mr. Rakowski became prime minister in September 1988 and held the post until August 1989. In July 1989 he was appointed first secretary of the Polish Communist Party, succeeding General Jaruzelski, who stayed on as president.In his leadership posts, Mr. Rakowski presided over “round-table” negotiations that led to the legalization of Solidarity, the dissolution of the Communist Party and Poland’s becoming a pluralist democracy.For many years, Mr. Rakowski, with his superb connections, his facility in languages (German, Russian and English) and a flair for sartorial style then unusual in Eastern Europe, was a magnet for visiting foreigners, particularly politicians and journalists, who liked his candor. He steadfastly defended Communist governance as necessary to avoid a Russian invasion.Mr. Walesa — whom Mr. Rakowski used to call “Doctor,” a sarcastic reference to his lack of formal education — said in an interview with The Washington Post last year that he had understood Mr. Rakowski’s view. Polish Communists, he said, thought that the Russians “had directed missiles at every Polish city.”“I do not punish people for faith, and they believed in that,” Mr. Walesa added. “I’m leaving the judgments to God.”Mieczyslaw Franciszek Rakowski was born on Dec. 1, 1926, in the western Polish village of Kowalewko. His father, a farmer, was shot by a Nazi firing squad.The younger Mr. Rakowski worked in a railway repair shop and then earned a doctorate in history. He joined the Communist Party in 1946 and was assigned in 1949 to the Central Committee to write party documents and propaganda.In 1956, Wladyslaw Gomulka became party leader and pushed for a relaxation of some of the more repressive policies of Stalin. In this new atmosphere of de-Stalinization, Mr. Rakowski helped found Polityka, a weekly. He was editor in chief from 1958 to 1982 and developed a talent for criticizing officials in metaphors.In the mid-1960s, as repression returned, Mr. Rakowski refused to follow others in attacking the Roman Catholic Church and Jews. He ignored orders to fire Jews.“If I am prepared to give up one tooth, I’ll have to give up all of them,” he said of his refusal to compromise on such issues, The Wall Street Journal reported in 1982.Mr. Rakowski’s first marriage was to Wanda Wilkomirska, a gifted Polish violinist. She was Jewish, was active in dissident groups and helped shape his liberalism by introducing him to artists and intellectuals who resisted Communism. They divorced in 1977. His second wife was Elzbieta Kepinska, an actress who was barred from performing by the theatrical establishment in protest of her husband’s association with martial law. After the first multiparty elections in 1989, she was able to resume her career.Mr. Rakowski is survived by Ms. Kepinska and two sons.In 1987, Mr. Rakowski was appointed the Central Committee’s secretary for propaganda, one of several party jobs he held between being deputy prime minister and prime minister.As chief propagandist, he controlled the same press censorship he had fought for a quarter-century.After the Polish Communist Party dissolved itself in January 1990, The Washington Post sent a reporter to the office of the party’s last leader. Mr. Rakowski sat facing an empty wall. He had taken down the portrait of Lenin that had hung there for years.“The Communist Party should be relegated to history,” he said.'"
"'08-11-12,'0','As the G.M.’s crisis deepens, the pressure increases in Washington to pass a rescue package for up to $50 billion in assistance for Detroit’s troubled Big Three or risk the economic fallout of a bankruptcy that would affect hundreds of thousands of jobs that rely on the auto industry.Democratic Congressional leaders said Tuesday they would push next week for emergency legislation to help the automakers.Despite a recent plea from President-elect Barack Obama, the Bush administration has been unwilling to commit any funds to Detroit beyond a $25 billion loan program to assist the companies in developing more fuel-efficient cars.G.M.’s chairman, Rick Wagoner, says the company cannot wait for aid that may come when Mr. Obama takes office in January.“This is an issue that needs to be addressed urgently,” Mr. Wagoner said in an interview with Automotive News.Investors drove G.M.’s stock down for a fifth consecutive day Tuesday. The company’s market value fell to about $1.7 billion, a more than 90 percent decline from a year ago. A spokesman for G.M., Steve Harris, said Tuesday that Mr. Wagoner’s job was not in jeopardy and reaffirmed the G.M. board’s support for its embattled chairman.“Nothing has changed relative to the G.M. board’s support for the G.M. management team during this historically difficult economic period for the U.S. auto industry,” he said.The depths of G.M.’s problems came to light in its federal filing that painted a bleak picture of a company that has lost more than $20 billion this year and is in danger of not being able to pay its bills in a few weeks.“We do not currently expect our operations to generate sufficient cash flow to fund our obligations as they come due,” the company said. “And we do not have other traditional sources of liquidity available to fund these obligations.”G.M. ended the third quarter with $16.2 billion in available cash. The company estimates it needs a minimum of $11 billion at any time to pay its bills.At its current pace, G.M. will have less than $10 billion by the end of the year — and that is after cutting 30 percent of its white-collar work force, halting the development of new models and temporarily shutting down most of its North American assembly plants in a desperate bid to save money.The credit-rating agency Standard & Poor’s cut its ratings on G.M. debt further into junk status on Tuesday, and Fitch ratings is also considering another cut.Analysts said G.M.’s inability to raise cash, other than from federal loans, will force another, deeper round of restructuring — at a minimum — to keep it solvent.“We expect cash outflows to quickly reduce the company’s liquidity during the next few quarters, perhaps to levels that would force G.M. to consider a financial restructuring, even if it does not file for bankruptcy,” S. & P. said.By its own admission, G.M. cannot cut its costs fast enough to balance the sharp fall in revenue in what is the worst United States vehicle market in 15 years.“Looking into the first two quarters of 2009, even with our planned actions, our estimated liquidity will fall significantly short of the minimum required to operate our business,” the company said its third-quarter filing.G.M. said the deterioration in its balance sheet could make it difficult to pay its suppliers by the end of this year, and it has no other sources of cash to tap except federal funds.It also said it might not be in compliance with its credit agreements, including a $4.5 billion revolving credit line and a $1.5 billion term loan. “There is no assurance we could cure a default, secure a waiver or arrange substitute financing,” G.M. said.'"
"'08-11-12,'0','Senator John McCain announced that he would run for president in February 2007 on “The Late Show With David Letterman” on CBS. On Tuesday, in his first public appearance since he delivered his concession speech on Nov. 4, he provided a bookend to his campaign on “The Tonight Show With Jay Leno” on NBC.Aside from wryly indicting his own “personality,” Mr. McCain declined to speculate on why he lost the election.He defended his running mate, Gov. Sarah Palin of Alaska, who some of his own aides, speaking anonymously, have blamed for his defeat. “Did you expect mavericks to stay on message?” he asked, before saying he “couldn’t be happier with Sarah Palin” and identifying her as part of a group of young governors, including Bobby Jindal of Louisiana and Tim Pawlenty of Minnesota, who represent “the next generation of our party.”He added: “Our party has a lot of work to do. We just got back from the woodshed.”Mr. McCain also recycled a joke he repeatedly used on the trail to describe his state of mind after his loss in the 2000 Republican presidential primaries.“I’ve been sleeping like a baby,” he said. “Sleep two hours, wake up and cry.”Mr. McCain praised President-elect Barack Obama as inspiring “millions of young people” and echoed the call for unity from his concession speech: “Now it’s time for America to join together and support the man who was just elected president.”Saying that the “one thing Americans don’t want is a sore loser,” Mr. McCain spoke of returning to the Senate.He also discussed a Senate colleague, Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut, the independent who caucuses with the Democrats and whose committee chairmanship is in question after his endorsement of Mr. McCain. Of speculation that Mr. Lieberman could join the Republican Party, Mr. McCain said, “I think that Joe is going to probably remain as what he is: an independent who stands up for what he believes in.”'"
"'08-11-12,'0','HOUSTON — Tom Hunt, a former chairman of Hunt Petroleum and an adviser to the founder of the family dynasty, his uncle H. L. Hunt, died on Tuesday in Dallas. He was 85 and lived in University Park in Dallas County.Baylor University Medical Center confirmed his death but provided no details.Mr. Hunt never reached the notoriety of his cousins Nelson Bunker Hunt and William Herbert Hunt, who tried to corner the world silver market in the 1970s and lost fortunes. But he was a negotiator in some of the family’s most important transactions, including the recent acquisition of Hunt Petroleum by XTO Energy for nearly $4.2 billion.Mr. Hunt was known as a mild-mannered lifelong bachelor in a family of great egos. He worked out of a sparse office, answered his own phone and entertained himself by gardening and making nut candy.He shirked publicity, but he became embroiled near the end of his life in a lawsuit filed by H. L. Hunt’s great-grandson Albert G. Hill III, who sued him and other relatives for their handling of two family trusts.The suit accused family members of mismanaging up to $4 billion in assets, including Hunt Petroleum, which traced its roots back nearly a century to a time when H. L. Hunt invested poker winnings in one of the country’s first oil rushes.The suit became a soap opera for Dallas oil society, as charges of fraud and tax evasion spilled from one Hunt generation to another. But it did not stop the sale of Hunt Petroleum to XTO.'"
"'08-11-12,'0','Heart attack and heart failure patients have a higher risk of a second heart attack or death if they take painkillers, including the generic drug ibuprofen and Celebrex, made by Pfizer, a Danish study has found.Patients who had suffered a heart attack and were taking Vioxx, a painkiller that has been withdrawn from the market, had 2.7 times the risk of having another heart attack or dying compared with patients not taking painkillers, according to research presented Tuesday at the American Heart Association meeting in New Orleans. Patients taking Celebrex had double the risk; patients taking the generic diclofenac had 1.9 times the risk, and those taking ibuprofen had 1.3 times the risk, the study found.Based on the findings, doctors should avoid prescribing nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for these patients, or give them at low doses, a researcher said.Also Tuesday, researchers said that the risk of heart attacks and strokes for heart-stent patients taking the anti-clotting drug Plavix increased if they also took anti-ulcer medicines like Nexium.Doctors implant about two million stents a year and often prescribe blood thinners like Plavix, made by Bristol-Myers Squibb and Sanofi-Aventis, to avoid clots. But the drugs raise the risk of stomach bleeding, so they also prescribe Nexium, made by AstraZeneca, or a rival drug in a group known as proton pump inhibitors. About a third of these patients suffered complications within a year, the study said.'"
"'08-11-12,'0','The sudden cold snap in the economy, more than in societies in the West and the Far East, has forced a collective rethinking of the country’s direction. Perhaps the most difficult question is being asked by Emiratis themselves, who want to know where they fit into their own country. In an odd case of role reversal, the minority of nationals fear they are becoming like colonial lords in their own country.“I’m not just concerned about my future, I’m concerned about the future of my country,” said Rashid Ali, 24. He and his friend Fahd Muhammad, 25, were the only Emiratis seated in a crowded city mall last week. “I’m concerned about our national identity,” Mr. Ali said.He and Mr. Muhammad embody the challenges and contradictions that have roiled this country, forcing a top-to-bottom reassessment in the face of a financial crush that has cut off the easy money that was the lifeblood of the development boom.The local population has largely been pacified by the largess of a gilded welfare state. For Mr. Ali and Mr. Muhammad, that meant free tuition and expenses for their university studies in Britain, including a monthly stipend of $1,258 while abroad.Returning from school this year, they were given government jobs that pay $3,600 a month, which like all income here is tax free. When they plan to marry, they said, the government will give them each a piece of land free and about $200,000 to build a house, plus access to a 10- or 20-year interest-free loan.That generosity is a problem now, as the government faces the prospect of having to control spending, raise revenue and encourage its own citizens to move into industries like finance and banking, which are now controlled by foreigners. Locals make up only 3 percent of the private work force, experts here said, with Emiratis opting for the shorter workday and higher pay of guaranteed government jobs.The problem is that many like Mr. Ali and Mr. Muhammad say they enjoy what they get from the growth — the luxury villas and fancy cars — but not the costs in terms of social change. If the economy slows too much, however, the fear is that the costs may ultimately outweigh the benefits.“Most people worry now, where is the welfare government?” said Salah Al Halyan, a financial consultant in Dubai, who explained the concerns of Emiratis. “Where is all the comfort? Where is my country? Who are all these people coming? The problem is the attitude of the nationals. They want to live on food stamps.”As the two men walked amid a sea of foreigners in the mall, they alternated between pride in the development and anger about what they called a loss of control of their national identity.“We are Bedouins, developed Bedouins, but we still have our traditions,” Mr. Ali said. “It’s all changing and disappearing.”And then with deep sarcasm, he said, “What’s up, dude?” a phrase as alien to his culture as blue jeans and, now, as common in his city as blue jeans.Sultan al-Suwaidi, a banker and member of the National Council, which serves as a kind of parliament or advisory board, said that he was hoping that the country would rethink its development model over the next decade and substantially reduce the number of foreigners. “We have to bring our percentages up to 40 percent; then there will be good control in our society,” he said.The financial crisis has also forced Emiratis to confront another fundamental question: Would the United Arab Emirates respond to the problems as one country or as seven separate entities, with Dubai in particular taking a go-it-alone approach? The answer, so far, has been one country, financial analysts said.Dubai and the six other emirates that make up the United Arab Emirates form a loose federation that gained independence in 1971. While always a commercial crossroads, a hub for trade and a center of the pearl industry, Dubai did not have its first concrete building until 1956. It relied on the Indian rupee as its currency until the early 1960s. Abu Dhabi, with its hefty oil reserves and huge wealth, was the political center of the emirates, its leader was the president of the federation.At the highest levels, Dubai and Abu Dhabi worked together to transform Dubai into a global destination for investment and development. But there was also an undercurrent of competition, with Abu Dhabi taking a slower, more conservative, petro-fueled approach while Dubai moved so fast that, at times, it was compared to a theme park. But when the financial storms appeared, Dubai — with a debt of nearly $50 billion — turned to the federal government, which quickly agreed to inject billions of dollars.“There is this question in the market whether Dubai is on its own, or is there a one-country approach,” said Marios Maratheftis, regional director of research at Standard Chartered, a Dubai-based bank. “There are signs there is a one-country approach.”These are the kinds of issues that the founders of the Cultural and Scientific Association, a public-private group devoted to promoting Emirati culture, take up every Monday night, when they gather to debate and exchange ideas. The association’s new building was opened in January, but it usually stands empty.On a recent Monday, 12 men sat in the lobby, designed to resemble a courtyard in a traditional house. They ate only traditional food, mostly beans and flat breads, and spoke a lot about the city’s demographic composition and its cultural identity, and how to get more Emiratis into the private work force.“I hear this complaint over and over, but what is the solution?” said Abdul Ghaffar Hussain, a businessman and writer. “What should I do, go to the street with a stick and chase people out? You have to be reasonable.”Bilal al-Bodour, a deputy minister of culture for the United Arab Emirates, walked through the building, showing it off with pride, and hope.“You have to learn about yourself and where you are coming from, before you can know others,” he said. “Everybody is concerned about this. It’s just a matter of degrees.”'"
"'08-11-12,'0','Tyco International, the industrial conglomerate, warned Tuesday that its fiscal-year profit would be well below Wall Street forecasts because of the economic downturn and the impact of the stronger dollar, setting off a 14 percent decline in its share price.The company reported a higher-than-expected quarterly profit on strong pricing in its electrical and metal products segment and increased demand for its valves and temperature controls.Tyco said its fourth-quarter profit rose to $434 million, or 91 cents a share, from $181 million, or 36 cents a share, a year earlier. Sales in the period, which ended Sept. 26, rose 7 percent, to $5.28 billion.Shares of Tyco, which is based in Bermuda, fell $3.60, to $21.74.'"
"'08-11-12,'0','But because of the toll that the credit squeeze has taken on financial institutions, busy developers like Mr. Rose may be more the exception than the rule. Though the need for affordable housing is likely to grow as unemployment worsens, specialists in mixed-income rental housing say that many developers — especially outside of New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Chicago — are finding it difficult or even impossible to put their deals together.“We think there is an enormous slowdown in the production of affordable housing that’s happening right now,” said Richard Paul Richman, the chairman of the Richman Group, a company based in Greenwich, Conn., that develops affordable housing nationwide. “We believe that the shortage of equity is so severe that even qualified developers won’t get funded.”The Richman Group is also a leading syndicator of low-income housing tax credits, the principal engine of affordable-housing development since 1986. Tax credits usually account for half to three-quarters of the development capital in an affordable housing deal, said Charles R. Werhane, the chief operating officer of Enterprise Community Investment, a division of Enterprise Community Partners, a national nonprofit organization based in Columbia, Md., that serves as an intermediary between developers and lenders.Allocated to the states by the United States government, the credits against federal taxable income are awarded to projects that meet the housing program’s strict requirements. The developer then finds a syndicator to sell the credits so that the proceeds can be invested in the projects. In recent years, the buyers have usually been financial institutions, which use them to offset profits over a 10-year period while also fulfilling their obligations under the federal Community Reinvestment Act to invest in poorer neighborhoods.Until this year, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac acquired about 35 percent of the tax credits. But as the government-sponsored agencies’ losses mounted, they stopped buying credits, as did another key player, Citigroup.As demand has slackened, the price of the credits has dropped. Tax credits that used to go for more than 90 cents on the dollar often command no more than 78 cents, with the result that the project gets less money, and the developer has to find other funds to close the equity gap. (To make up some of the deficit, the federal government recently expanded the number of tax credits by 10 percent and offered other incentives to investors.)It is not known just how much the $8 billion tax credit industry business has shrunk, because developers who are awarded credits have two years to try to make a project work. “Returning credits is the last, final step,” said Garth Rieman, the director of housing advocacy for the National Council of State Housing Agencies. “It’s an admission of failure, an admission that they can’t get the deal done.”Michael Novogradac, the managing partner of Novoco, a national accounting firm based in San Francisco that has an extensive affordable housing practice, estimated that no more than $6 billion in tax credits would be sold this year. “We’re definitely seeing developers turn projects back to the state, and others with good-sized gaps trying to close them,” he said. Unused credits are pooled and reallocated to states with more demand, a practice that could eventually benefit New York.Enterprise, also a major syndicator that sells tax credits to investors, expects to close 95 projects this year, compared with 115 projects last year, Mr. Werhane said. “The industry in general is probably down about 30 percent,” he said. Nationwide, about 125,000 units of income-restricted rental housing are added each year.In New York, where the supply of affordable housing is considered unlikely ever to come close to meeting the need, the prospects for seasoned developers remain relatively good, industry specialists said. The Bloomberg administration is more than halfway toward a goal of developing 165,000 units of affordable housing by fiscal year 2013, but the program will probably require an extra year, said Seth Donlin, a spokesman for the city Department of Housing Preservation and Development.L&M Development Partners and the Dunn Development Corporation, two New York firms, recently transformed a former garbage transfer station in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn into Palmer’s Dock, where monthly rents range from $398 to $920. Martin Dunn, the president of Dunn Development, said the city had received 13,000 applications for 113 apartments. The residents were chosen by lottery.Investors in tax credits have become increasingly picky because credits are rescinded in the event of a foreclosure and cost overruns cannot be passed on to tenants. “The good deals are getting done, but others on the margins are not getting done,” said Robert D. Taylor, the president of the Wells Fargo Community Development Corporation, which does business in the West. “You want to pick a developer who can be on time and on budget.”Investors also wonder if market rents in many areas outside New York will decline to the point where there will be little need for subsidized apartments. But that would mean no new supply would be available when the market recovered, said Todd J. Crow, an executive vice president of PNC Multifamily Capital, the tax credit investor in the Tapestry.“We are being confronted with market conditions that are unprecedented for us in the life of this program,” Mr. Crow said, referring to the tax credit program. “We have just never seen market forces take such a toll on our business.”'"
"'08-11-12,'0','Delta blues, maybe more than any other genre of American music, is rooted in time and place. Although scholars and critics still bicker about the music’s precise parameters, nearly all agree it was conceived and realized in an almond-shaped wedge of northwest Mississippi during the first half of the 20th century. David (Honeyboy) Edwards, who was born in 1915 in Shaw, Miss., about 15 miles east of the Mississippi River, deep in the flood-prone, cotton-covered Delta, was a contemporary of Robert Johnson and Sonny Boy Williamson, and his show at the B. B. King Blues Club and Grill on Monday night was an uncommon opportunity to see an original Delta bluesman perform live.Mr. Edwards, 93, has a rutted face that reflects years of transience: for much of his life he was itinerant, riding freight trains and hitchhiking with a guitar slung over his shoulder. He did not commit his work to tape until 1942, when he was recorded by the folklorist Alan Lomax for the Library of Congress. Mr. Edwards moved to Chicago in the early 1950s, recorded a handful of songs for Chess Records and began performing in tiny blues clubs and on street corners. He has been releasing new material relatively consistently, for a variety of labels, since 1979.Mr. Edwards’s 11-song, half-electric, half-acoustic set was a mix of traditional covers and original compositions. He opened with Robert Petway’s “Catfish Blues,” which includes the daydream “If I were a catfish, swimmin’ in the deep blue sea, I’d have all you pretty women fishin’ after me.” Mr. Edwards, his guitar askew in his lap, sang the lyrics with mischievous aplomb.Blues music is known for its mesmeric 12-bar patterns, but early Mississippi blues, which was frequently performed solo, can be metrically unpredictable, driven by a sophisticated internal pulse.Mr. Edwards’s backing musicians — the harmonica player Michael Frank and the rhythm guitarist Rocky Lawrence — did their best to buoy his lead guitar work, although the strains of translating a one-man genre into an ensemble exercise occasionally showed. Mr. Lawrence kept close watch on Mr. Edwards’s hands (during “Standing on the Corner,” in particular), periodically releasing an incredulous chuckle as he did his best to keep time.'"
"'08-11-12,'0','So far, OPEC producers have announced cuts totaling about 1.1 million barrels a day, less than the 1.5 million barrels a day that the cartel agreed to last month. According to estimates by PFC Energy, a consulting firm, however, producers have actually trimmed their production by only about 800,000 barrels a day.Despite these efforts, slower consumption has continued to weigh on oil markets, pushing prices down on Tuesday to their lowest level since March 2007.Crude oil futures on the New York Mercantile Exchange settled at $59.33 a barrel, down 5 percent. Prices have plummeted since hitting a peak of $145.29 a barrel in July.Producers face the difficult task of seeking to balance oil supplies with slowing demand during one of the worst economic slowdowns in recent memory.The International Monetary Fund recently warned that the world faced the prospect of a simultaneous recession in the United States, Europe and Japan for the first time in more than 60 years. The Chinese economy, long the main engine of growth in oil demand, is also slowing.As a result, a growing number of oil specialists now expect global demand to drop this year, which would be the first annual decline since 1983.“In a falling demand environment, it is extremely difficult to stem a price drop,” said Francisco Blanch, a commodity strategist at Merrill Lynch. “Global economic growth is still trending down and it will be a few quarters before we see a trough for oil prices. Until then, OPEC will try to figure out what the right level of production is going to be. That’s a hard thing to do.”After gasoline prices soared above $4 a gallon earlier this year, oil demand in the United States dropped over the summer. Consumption fell by 1.8 million barrels a day, or 8 percent, to 19.3 million barrels a day in August, compared with the same period a year ago, according to the latest monthly estimates from the Energy Department.As a result, refineries ran at their slowest pace in 21 years in August, typically one of the busiest months of the year. At the same time, inventories of crude oil kept building at a steady clip, suggesting there was more oil in the market than needed.Since July 4, gasoline prices have dropped for 17 weeks, to a nationwide average of about $2.22 a gallon, according to AAA, the automobile club. That is about 90 cents less than at the same time last year.OPEC, whose members account for 40 percent of the world’s oil exports, is scheduled to meet in Algeria next month. An Iranian oil official said on Tuesday that the producers might be forced to meet before that if prices continued to slide.OPEC’s cohesion will probably be tested in coming months if prices keep falling. Some countries, like Saudi Arabia, can afford to see lower prices for a while, while the price drop is already hurting producers like Iran and Venezuela.Michael Wittner, the global head of oil research at the French bank Société Générale, in London, said it was probable that OPEC would reduce production by another million barrels a day next month.“OPEC appears to be taking this very seriously, and they are telling their customers they would be getting less crude,” Mr. Wittner said. “But prices keep falling because despite all that, the markets have been down-shifting to a lower economic growth and slower oil demand.”David Kirsch, an oil analyst at PFC Energy, said OPEC producers knew they could not alter the market’s short-term view. But by starting to trim their output, they were trying to set the stage for a rebound in prices next year.“What OPEC is looking for is managing the fundamentals so they can create the conditions for a price recovery at some point, when the global economy starts to recover,” he said.'"
"'08-11-12,'0','The revival of the bridge was more than symbolic. Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki’s government was eager to put cars and trucks back onto this major traffic artery, as part of its drive to open up Baghdad’s blocked roads, which create huge congestion for the estimated 1.3 million vehicles on the city’s roads.Iraqi armored vehicles lined the approach roads to the bridge, which run past two of the country’s most famous mosques: the golden Kadhimiya shrine, burial place of the eighth-century saint Imam Musa al-Kadhim, and the ornate Abu Hanifa Mosque, burial place of the Islamic religious scholar known as Imam Adham.Tensions between the communities run deep. Sunni Adhamiya, now walled off from other neighborhoods of overwhelmingly Shiite east Baghdad, was a stronghold of support for Saddam Hussein, whereas Kadhimiya’s shrine is the holiest in Baghdad for Shiites.However, speakers on Tuesday highlighted past efforts at cross-community cooperation. Some cited Othman Ali Obaidi, an 18-year-old Sunni high school student who drowned when he dived into the Tigris in 2005 to rescue Shiite pilgrims.Ahmed Abdel Ghafour al-Sammaraie, the head of the Sunni Endowment, which oversees Sunni mosques, said that Iraqis were “united as one body” and that if any part fell ill, all the other parts “will fall sick as well.” Saleh al-Haidari, his counterpart at the parallel Shiite Endowment, hailed a “glorious day.” He added, “It is the day of Iraqis who proved to the whole world that we are a united people.”In Adhamiya, Muhanned Saleh, 46, said he believed that the opening meant “a new and good stage of nonsectarianism.”But not all Iraqis in the two neighborhoods were convinced. Another man in Adhamiya, Nazar al-Azawi, 42, said he was not yet comfortable “because the security situation is not good, and maybe the opening of the bridge will be exploited to inflame troubles again.” He continued, “I wish that opening had been postponed for a year, until everything is settled.”Opinions were divided even among families. In Kadhimiya, Bashra Umm Ameer, 41, said that she would not use the bridge and that she was opposed to the reopening. “It is the connection between two different areas, one very much belonging to the Shiites and the other very much belonging to the Sunnis,” she said. “If the security gets worse, the sectarian war will return.”However her daughter Shahinaz, 16, rejoiced, saying, “I have many friends in Adhamiya, and I haven’t seen them for a long time.”Of the Americans present, Col. Bill Salter, a military adviser working with Iraq’s Baghdad Operations Command, said the Iraqi leaders “have been working extremely hard to balance both security and freedom of movement for the civilians, and that is a challenge.” As an Iraqi band played in the background, he added, “This is a great day.”'"
"'08-11-12,'0','There was no end in sight on Tuesday, analysts said, only more signs of weak corporate earnings, economic contraction and reduced consumer spending.The gloomy mood was driven by falling profits at retailers like the coffee chain Starbucks and the discount clothing chain TJX Companies, which owns T. J. Maxx and Marshall’s department stores. Adding to the woes was the bankruptcy filing of the electronics retailer Circuit City Stores.On the housing front, government-controlled mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac announced a program to stem the tide of home foreclosures while a major home builder reported sobering revenue.Shares in Toll Brothers, the builder of luxury homes, fell slightly after the company reported a sharp decline in sales through the end of October. Toll’s revenue from home building in the last three months fell 41 percent, to $691 million, from $1.17 billion over the same period in 2007.About 30 percent of Toll’s contracts from the current quarter have canceled. In a statement accompanying the numbers, the chief executive, Robert I. Toll, made a plea for more government intervention in the housing market.“We urge Congress to stimulate demand by reducing mortgage rates and fees and by providing incentives such as a buyer tax credit for the purchase of all types of homes,” he said in a statement. “We believe these initiatives would offer the greatest benefit for the taxpayer’s dollar.”Shares in Starbucks also declined, falling 2 percent, after the coffee chain reported Monday that its net income had fallen 97 percent as it closed down 600 stores and laid off 1,000 employees as part of a reorganization.G.M. had another rough day; its stock slipped below $3, to $2.92 a share, its lowest price in decades. On Monday, as politicians discussed a federal bailout for the American auto industry, an analyst downgraded G.M. shares to sell and set the company’s target stock price at $0. Shares in automakers including Toyota, the Ford Motor Company and Honda also slid. “Everyone agrees that we’re in a recession, so the markets have priced that in,” said Douglas M. Peta, an independent market strategist. “But I don’t think they’ve priced in what appears to be an increasingly sharp and increasingly protracted recession.”Shrinking portfolios, slumping earnings and corporate cutbacks have hobbled consumer spending and employment numbers, and those symptoms of a slowdown are washing back onto the markets.“All of these measures taken together suggest that the slowing is worse than investors had expected, and that it is occurring very, very abruptly,” Mr. Peta said.The slowdown continued to weigh on energy prices.Crude oil prices in New York dipped below $60, settling at $59.33 a barrel, down $3.08 for the day. As oil prices dwindled on worries of falling demand, shares in energy companies like Exxon Mobil, Chevron and Royal Dutch Shell declined. The Hess Corporation was down 9.1 percent.Prices for commodities like gold, sugar, coffee and cattle slid on Tuesday as traders worried that a worldwide slowdown would suppress demand. The falloff in raw-materials prices is hurting developing countries with economies built on exports, and on Tuesday, the World Bank trimmed its growth forecast for developing economies to 4.5 percent, from 6.4 percent.“I don’t think that anyone is trying to ascribe rational valuation to anything right now,” Mark Mathias, chief executive of Quantum Asset Management, said of the commodities sell-off. “They’re just selling it because they can sell it.”The bond markets were closed for Veterans Day.'"

"'08-11-13,'1','And it would cost a mere $10 billion a month to cover the country’s roughly 40 million mortgages! That’s not quite chump change, but it’s less than the $700 billion rescue plan.“When this started I thought this is what they’re going to do, because it’s the logical thing,” Mr. Peterffy said. “But, surprise, it’s not what they’re doing. I think the problem is that it’s so simple that people don’t even start thinking about it.”Yes, there’s the issue of the rich getting free money they don’t need, but he said you could exclude mortgage payments of more than $2,000. Still, what about the renters? Why throw free money at perfectly solvent homeowners? What about homeowners who just paid off their mortgages? Where does the $250 figure come from, and who says it would save enough homes from foreclosure? Well, nothing’s perfect.Despite full-page ads Mr. Peterffy placed in The New York Times, The Washington Post and The Wall Street Journal, it’s pretty clear his idea hasn’t reached critical mass. And with Mr. Paulson’s announcement on Wednesday and the line of bailout supplicants getting longer every day, the chances of his plan happening seem to be disappearing.At the very least, Mr. Peterffy gets points for being considerate of the rest of us, who don’t know much about Libor interest rate spreads and the VIX, the volatility index, but can figure out who’s going to shell out the $700 billion and not even get the T-shirt.MR. PETERFFY’S plan, whether the right one or not, is a creative proposal by a serious person. But for us dolts out here contemplating the new bailout era, perhaps it’s worth pondering other earmarks that might provide an effective homeowners’ rescue package.¶The X Chromosome Differential: Anyone with teenagers knows that once high school boys stop growing, you’re pretty much set with the same jeans, T-shirts and cargo pants until they’re ready to leave college and need a suit for interviews.

One dog of our acquaintance — we’ll call him Walter because that’s his name — is 12 and still going strong. But, man, you can hear some horror stories. Add $50 more per month for pills, added trips to the vet and treats.¶The Sinatra Proviso: If you can make it here, maybe you can make it anywhere, but one recent study of tax burdens, by the Tax Foundation, a nonpartisan group, had Connecticut, New Jersey and New York with the heaviest burdens.

"'08-11-13,'1','The Red Sox follow the Houston Astros and the Pittsburgh Pirates (for the seventh straight season at PNC Park) in freezing their ticket prices.The Milwaukee Brewers did not increase prices on 27 percent of their seats at Miller Park, but raised the average price for 2009 by 5 percent.“That’s historically low for a team that just reached the postseason after not making the playoffs for a while,” Rick Schlesinger, the Brewers’ executive vice president for business operations, said recently.Hours after the Red Sox announced their price freeze, the N.F.L. said that the average price paid by fans for 2009 playoff tickets, except the Super Bowl, would be 10 percent less than it was last January. The three rounds of postseason games this year cost an average of $121 a ticket.Pricing, done by the playoff teams for the games leading to the Super Bowl, will be set in conjunction with Commissioner Roger Goodell.The Red Sox’ business operation is considered one of the most sophisticated in baseball; the team is entering the eighth season of a plan to modernize Fenway Park, built in 1912, and increase its capacity from 36,108.Andrew Zimbalist, a professor of economics at Smith College and an expert on sports economics, said the Red Sox’ price-freeze was an admission of difficult times ahead by one of the elite teams in baseball.“It means that even with a wildly popular team, in a stadium with the smallest seating capacity, and in a large market with the most excess demand for tickets, the anticipated economic condition next spring and summer is so weak that it will not sustain further increases in ticket prices,” Zimbalist said.The Red Sox’ acknowledgment of the effects of the recession and the toll high prices have taken on fans comes as the Yankees are building a $1.3 billion stadium scheduled to open in April. Although the team has said that the prices for 25,000 seats would not be increased over 2008 levels, a considerable number of tickets, especially the premium ones, will cost much more. Some tickets, fans have said, have soared from $220 in the current stadium to $650 for the equivalent locations in the new one.The Yankees have seven unsold luxury suites at the new stadium, and the number of potential season-ticket and premium-seat buyers has slowed.“We can see that the economy is affecting the traffic,” Lonn Trost, the Yankees’ chief operating officer, said Tuesday. “Listen, nobody can avoid it. We recognize it. You wake up in the morning, and you see it.”In their state of perpetual rivalry, the Yankees, with a $209.1 million player payroll, failed to make the playoffs last season, while the Red Sox spent $133.4 million and lost to Tampa Bay in the American League Championship Series.Team Marketing Report said the Yankees’ average ticket price of $41.40 was third. But the Yankees’ average premium ticket price of $203.72 was higher than the $163.86 of the Red Sox, but ranked second to the Dodgers’ $223.38.The prices for Fenway’s premium seats, which fans have contracts for, were also frozen at $150 to $325 each, and fans buying them will get a year added to their contracts.The deepening recession is beginning to alter the pricing equation of a sport that usually only sees attendance and ticket costs rise. “I think baseball teams get it,” said Jon Greenberg, the executive editor of Team Marketing Report. “If they don’t, they will. When the Boston Red Sox aren’t raising prices, how can other teams justify it?”Lucchino said that Boston was feeling the impact of rising unemployment. “We’re still early in the display of real-world consequences,” he said.Meanwhile, the Tribune Co., which has been trying to sell the Chicago Cubs since April 2007, told potential buyers in a recent letter that it was seeking bids by Nov. 27. The company, which wants more than $1 billion for the team and Wrigley Field, is telling suitors it will be flexible in the stake it is willing to sell and in the length of the payout. Any buyer then needs to secure financing in one of the worst credit markets in memory.'"
"'08-11-13,'1','“Just let market forces play out,” said Matthew J. Slaughter, associate dean at the Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth. “And if G.M. or one of the other companies files for bankruptcy, support the workers and the communities that would affected by a bankruptcy filing.”William Ackman, a prominent activist investor who runs Pershing Square Capital, said Tuesday that G.M. should consider bankruptcy. “The way to solve that problem is not to lend more money to G.M.,” he said in an interview with on .Instead, G.M. should submit a prepackaged bankruptcy, laying out steps it plans to enact once in Chapter 11 protection, said Mr. Ackman, who is not a major holder of G.M. shares.“I’d rather the government’s money be used to train people for other jobs,” Mr. Ackman said. “The bankruptcy word scares people. It’s simply a system.”Not surprisingly, , G.M.’s chief executive, disagrees. He told investors last week that “the consequences of bankruptcy would be dire and extend far beyond” the company. G.M. will “take every action we possibly can to avoid it,” he added.The company also may be forced to take drastic actions as a condition of receiving any federal . It may include stiff requirements that G.M. and other automakers restructure and meet financial goals before they can get access to federal financing. Lawmakers may also demand a change in management.Such demands “may have the same end as a restructuring,” but avoid the taint of an actual bankruptcy filing, said Susan R. Helper, a professor of regional economic development at Case Western Reserve University.Even though a bankruptcy might help create a stronger company in the long run, consumers could easily see it as a sign that the cars they bought might not retain their value, and seek other options when shopping for a new car. (By contrast, travelers tend to have fewer concerns about flying on airlines operating in bankruptcy because their commitment ends with the flight.)A car is “a major investment for a lot of families and the assurance that it will perform for a set period of time is part of the bargain,” said Christie L. Nordhielm, an associate professor of marketing at the .To help ease consumers’ fears, G.M. could put money in escrow to reimburse its 6,468 dealers for any repairs to address problems covered by warranties. Airlines have taken such steps in the past to guarantee the value of tickets for future flights.A study of 6,000 consumers last summer by CNW Marketing found that 80 percent of them said they would switch companies if G.M. or filed for bankruptcy protection in the , suggesting that only G.M. loyalists would stand by the automaker.A bankruptcy filing by a single Detroit car company could cost the economy $175 billion in the first year of the legal case in lost employee income and tax revenue, the Center for Automotive Research estimated this week. Given the complexity, a G.M. bankruptcy case could last three years or more.A bankruptcy at G.M., with $111 billion in assets, would rank as one of the biggest bankruptcies ever, but would still be dwarfed by the case filed by in September.There are parallels between the Lehman bankruptcy and G.M.’s situation. In each case, the government was faced with deciding whether it was worth favoring one entity over its competitors as it worried about the impact on the broader economy of a potential collapse.Certainly workers in other industries who have lost their jobs may feel the government should extend more help to them, too.“Why should the government treat G.M., Ford and workers any differently?” said Professor Slaughter.But the union, which has joined the automakers to push for a bailout, might find grounds for a strike if a bankrupt G.M. asked a court to throw out its labor contracts.A bankruptcy also could jeopardize the fate of a health care fund created in 2007 that was supposed to shift a $100 billion burden off the companies’ backs. The U.A.W. recently agreed to let G.M. delay payments to the fund.Professor Helper, of Case Western Reserve, said the social cost to communities in , and other states where its 55 plants and other operations are located could be devastating, if G.M. were to liquidate or significantly cut its work force.“Even if they go bankrupt in a year, it is better than going bankrupt now,” given the state of the national economy, she said. “From a social point of view, even if G.M. is not providing a return on investment, it is still providing a lot of good jobs.”'"
"'08-11-13,'1','Mr. Woods was interviewed 34 years after the church bombing, a seminal civil rights event, because he had played a leading role in spurring the federal government to re-investigate it. Only one man, Robert E. Chambliss, a member of the Ku Klux Klan, had been convicted, in 1977. The new investigation led to the conviction of two other Klansmen, Thomas Blanton Jr. and Bobby Frank Cherry.In 1990, Mr. Woods, then president of the Birmingham chapter of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, led protests against the Shoal Creek Golf and Country Club, just outside the city. The club, which had no black members, had been chosen as the site of that year’s P.G.A. Championship, and its founder, Hall Thompson, defended it by saying, “We don’t discriminate in every other area except the blacks.”The protests prompted major corporations, including I.B.M., to withdraw their advertising from ABC’s television coverage of the tournament. In response, the club announced that it would accept black members.David B. Fay, executive director of the United States Golf Association, said at the time that the events at Shoal Creek had changed the face of golf. “I find it highly unlikely that you will see any championships held at all-white clubs anymore,” Mr. Fay said. “The change is inevitable.”Abraham Lincoln Woods Jr. was born in Birmingham on Oct. 7, 1928, one of 11 children of the Rev. Abraham Woods Sr. and the former Maggie Wallace.Mr. Woods attended Morehouse with Dr. King in the late 1940s. He later received a bachelor’s degree in theology from Birmingham Baptist College; a bachelor’s in sociology from Miles College, in Birmingham; and a master’s in American history from the University of Alabama.In the 1950s, he helped organize voter registration drives in Alabama. Then, in the spring of 1963, he led the first black demonstration at a whites-only lunch counter, at Newberry’s department store in downtown Birmingham. During the demonstrations that followed, Dr. King arrived in the city to confront the tactics of its public safety commissioner, Bull Connor, who had turned dogs and fire hoses on protesters. Dr. King, Mr. Woods, other civil rights leaders and hundreds of additional protesters were arrested.Responding to appeals from liberal white Southern clergymen to stop the demonstrations, Dr. King wrote his landmark “Letter From Birmingham Jail,” in which he said not only that civil disobedience was justified in the face of unjust laws but also that “one has a moral responsibility to disobey unjust laws.”Mr. Woods retired as president of the Birmingham chapter of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference in 2006 but remained pastor of St. Joseph Baptist Church until his death.Besides his son Abraham, he is survived by his wife of 60 years, the former Marian Dowdell-Levette; four brothers, Roy, Calvin, Franklin and Dwight; four sisters, Lottie Hall, Lois Woods, Shirley Patterson and Cathy Gray; another son, John; five daughters, Yvonne Bell, Anita McGhee, Ruth Williams, Sharon Woods-Woodruff and Alice Woods; 18 grandchildren; and 10 great-grandchildren.One granddaughter, Marian Bell, said Mr. Woods followed the presidential campaign this year with mounting hopes, 45 years after Birmingham.On election night last week, in his hospital room, Ms. Bell asked him what he was thinking about the results. He said, “If I could wake up Martin, Coretta, Rosa,” along with other leaders of the struggle, “I would tell them that my son Barack made it.”'"
"'08-11-13,'1','Would it be all right, Justice John Paul Stevens asked, for the government to exclude the names of gay soldiers from the Vietnam memorial?And what was the church’s position, Justice Antonin Scalia wanted to know, about “a monument to chocolate chip cookies”?The case arrived at the court in unusual doctrinal garb, which explains some of the confusion. The justices are used to thinking about cases involving Ten Commandments monuments under the First Amendment’s religion clauses, which prohibit government establishment of religion and protect its free exercise.But this case, Pleasant Grove City v. Summum, No. 07-665, involves the First Amendment’s free speech clause. The clause generally forbids the government from discriminating among private speakers in public forums on the basis of the content of their speech.The Summum church contends that the government can no more discriminate among donated private monuments in public parks than it can among speeches and leaflets.Governments, however, do not need to give equal time to contrary ideas when they are speaking for themselves. Daryl Joseffer, representing the federal government, said that monuments in public parks were just that kind of government speech.“If we couldn’t formulate and express viewpoints,” Mr. Joseffer said, “I would be here today in support of neither party.”In fact, the government supported the city.Lawyers for the church accepted the point about government speech as a general matter, but they said the city must explicitly adopt the message of the Ten Commandments monument for it to count. The city has said only that the monument reflects the area’s pioneer heritage; it has stopped short of endorsing the religious message on the monument.Mr. Joseffer said the First Amendment imposes no such adoption requirement. Monuments in public parks, he said, need not “have some formal disclaimer on them saying, ‘I am the United States and I approve this message.’ ”It is enough, he said, for the government to own the given monument and have the right to display it, “drop it to the bottom of the ocean” or “sell it on eBay.”Chief Justice Roberts said there was a tension in the city’s position.“You’re really just picking your poison, aren’t you?” he told Jay A. Sekulow, who represented the city. “The more you say that the monument is government speech” to avoid the free speech clause problem, the chief justice said, “the more it seems to me you’re walking into a trap under the establishment clause.”Pamela Harris, representing the church, said “the city is a bit on the horns of a dilemma” in that regard. But Ms. Harris’s answers to the series of hypothetical questions, and in particular her insistence that the city must formally adopt the message of the Ten Commandments monument, did not seem to satisfy several of the justices.Mr. Joseffer had to be pressed to answer the question about excluding the names of gay soldiers. In the end, he said the First Amendment’s free speech clause, at least, places no limits on whom the government chooses to honor.Justice Scalia agreed. “It seems to me the government could disfavor homosexuality,” he said, “just as it could disfavor abortion.”'"
"'08-11-13,'1','“I want to thank my lawyer for saving my life,” he said, wrapping his arm around the lawyer, Daniel S. Parker. “I just want to go home to my family, rest in my bed and be with my kids.”In the hours before Ms. Brock, 23, died on Oct. 8, 2005, she and Mr. Gauthier were in the courtyard of the Harlem housing project where they lived. Ms. Brock had gotten into at least two fights with people there, Mr. Parker said. About 3 a.m., Mr. Gauthier grabbed Ms. Brock, wrapped his arm around her neck and pulled her into her building, Mr. Parker said. A surveillance video showed him holding her in a headlock, he said.Later that morning, when Mr. Gauthier woke up, he discovered Ms. Brock lying dead next to him in bed, Mr. Parker said. Mr. Gauthier knocked on a neighbor’s door to ask for help but fled before the police arrived because he was scared, Mr. Parker said. The authorities have said he had been arrested on drugs and weapons charges in the past. He turned himself in several days later.“The videos in this case are devastating,” Mr. Parker said. But they did not tell the entire story, he said, adding that Mr. Gauthier was pulling Ms. Brock into the building in a headlock to keep her from getting into another fight.He acknowledged that she had injuries consistent with strangulation. But a toxicology report revealed that Ms. Brock had in her system marijuana, alcohol and four times the therapeutic dosage for an antidepressant drug, Mr. Parker said. Ms. Brock was asthmatic, bipolar and epileptic, he said.The doctor who performed the autopsy concluded the death was caused by strangulation before receiving the results of the toxicology report, Mr. Parker said. The doctor, Elizabeth A. Bundock, is now the deputy chief medical examiner in Vermont. She did not return a telephone call seeking comment.Experts hired by the defense noticed the alcohol and drugs. This week the medical examiner’s office said that the cause of death could not be determined. But Ellen Borakove, a spokeswoman for the medical examiner, denied that the office had ignored the toxicology report and said that the initial autopsy finding was accurate based on the information available at the time.A few weeks ago, a senior medical examiner was notified by prosecutors that Ms. Brock had been able to speak to friends after she was in the headlock, Ms. Borakove said. The senior medical examiner told Charles S. Hirsch, the chief medical examiner, of the new information on Monday, leading the office to change the cause of death to undetermined, Ms. Borakove said.“We know for a fact she was strangled; we know she was intoxicated,” Ms. Borakove said. “Which one to attribute the cause of death to, we can’t be certain beyond a reasonable doubt.”But Mr. Gauthier’s lawyer framed the decision differently. “The daunting thing is he could have done 25 years to life for a murder that never happened,” Mr. Parker said.On Wednesday, flanked by about half a dozen family members, Mr. Gauthier had a wide grin on his face as he left the courthouse. He said he was heading to a church to pray, before going home to his children and his parents.'"
"'08-11-13,'1','Another option is to secure a laptop’s files with an encryption program like TrueCrypt (truecrypt.org), which is free, or PGP Endpoint, which sells for $50 (pgp.com). These programs render all the files indecipherable if the laptop falls into the wrong hands. Some USB flash drives also come with encryption software.ADD THE ‘S’ Travelers should take care to type “https” at the beginning of all their sensitive Web site addresses (like those of banks), especially when using a computer in a public place. Web browsers normally use the hypertext transfer protocol (http), but many sites (not all) also accept https connections, which provide extra security. Users of Google’s Gmail can automatically force secure connections with an options setting in the program.OUTSOURCE E-MAIL Businesses no longer need to run their own e-mail networks, because many inexpensive alternatives will rent them as many mailboxes as needed. These providers will manage the entire e-mail process and offer a full collection of features, including the ability to screen and block messages that contain spam and viruses.Google’s Gmail is free, or $50 a mailbox a year for those who require more support. Other services are more specialized, like 123together.com, which offers to host a company’s e-mail on its Microsoft Exchange servers for $10 a mailbox a month.ENCRYPT E-MAIL Individual e-mail messages that contain sensitive information like customer or financial data can be encrypted with security software. Unencrypted e-mail could be easily intercepted and read if sent over the Internet in ordinary text. The simplest way to encrypt e-mail is with a service like PGP Universal (which comes with various options and at a wide range of prices at pgp.com) or Voltage Security Network ($65 a person a year at voltage.com). Of course, recipients of your messages will need software that can decrypt what you’ve sent.BLOCK OUTSIDERS Ensure secure access to an office network when you’re traveling with a virtual private network. This will prevent anyone from monitoring your communications and is particularly important when using a public network or otherwise sharing Internet access with strangers.The options include LogMeIn Hamachi ($40 a year at logmein.com) or the free software from OpenVPN.net. With one of these on your computer, you can open, copy and save files from your office network without having to worry about a hacker reading over your shoulder.“Hamachi allows us to connect to hundreds of our customers and monitor live videos of our security cameras discreetly and without having to worry about being compromised by unauthorized users,” said Ben Molloy, vice president of Pro-Vigil Inc. in San Antonio, which provides off-hours video security monitoring for construction sites.Granted, all these security measures require some work. “Until you see the light and the need for these products, such as with a stolen laptop or lost data, no one else is going to be able to motivate you to use them,” says Sean Steele, a data security consultant from InfoLock Technologies in Arlington, Va. “A single data breach could easily cost several orders of magnitude more than any of these solutions.”'"
"'08-11-13,'1','A big reason this benefit is largely immune to cost-cutting is that companies usually do not pay extra for it. And small-business managers say the advice helps them as much as their staff.“It does us no good to have stressed-out employees with problems outside work that affect their work or lower their productivity,” said Garry Markle, vice president of the Spiratex Company, a plastics manufacturer in Romulus, Mich. Spiratex brings in two advisers for its 127 employees.Principal Financial Group, a financial services firm based in Des Moines that specializes in small and medium-size businesses, says the number of individual meetings has been growing 20 percent a year since the company began holding them in 2003. Principal Financial now works with 380,000 employees at 1,700 companies.Countless small companies and independent advisers also provide this service; typically they also administer the small business’s retirement plan. They simply tack on a few extra hours to a regular visit, as Fidelity did at Torch, using that time to meet for 15 to 30 minutes with each interested employee. While the adviser may try to focus on the company’s benefits menu, the discussion can range over the employee’s entire financial portfolio, from budgeting to life insurance to saving for children’s college tuition to estate planning — and, these days, market panic.Justin S. Howard, a partner at Cherry Street Partners in Madison, Conn., who has been hired at six very small companies, says he discusses “current market conditions and how it’s affecting them and their goals.” He also offers timeless guidance: “Their homework assignment might be to develop a budget.”It’s not charity that leads financial advisers to offer these sessions free. “The service kind of pays for itself,” said Luke Vandermillen, head of the advisory program at Principal. “We tend to attract more clients as a result of this.”Michelle Price, manager of the Manhattan branch of the brokerage firm Edward Jones, has been trying to reach beyond her retail clientele by offering free one-on-one meetings at small businesses — so far, without success. Her strategy: “The employee could decide to become a client of mine. Or perhaps they’ll tell their sister or their brother, who has more specific needs.”After a Principal representative met last spring with the 50 employees of the Righter Company, a general contractor in Columbus, Ohio, nearly all of them ended up buying added insurance from Principal, according to Righter’s president, Brad Nadolson. He admits that he was at first a bit concerned about the pitching of products by the advisers at the sessions. “But the financial planning they do speaks for itself,” he added. “As long as it was low pressure.”Because the meetings are usually during working hours, businesses must consider the cost of lost work time — $1,000 and up, managers say.To many executives, the service is worth the lost work. D. Holly Lifke, vice president of human resources at Society Insurance in Fond du Lac, Wis., has not paid Principal for its annual employee meetings, which started in 2007, but she says she would be willing to pay up to $100 an hour for extra visits during this financial turmoil.The counseling has already produced results: Over half of Society Insurance’s 252 employees have sat down with Principal, and employees are now saving 8 percent of their salary, on average, up from 6 percent. “We have employees that now feel more confident in their ability to retire and their ability to save for their children’s education,” Ms. Lifke said.'"
"'08-11-13,'1','Marcus Muniz, president of Boxes Etc., a company based in Orlando, Fla., which sells preassembled shipping containers and supplies, has also sought to be paid. Last month, about 30 percent of his 1,000 clients were 60 days behind in their payments, with the average debt about $7,000.“It’s a trickle-down effect,” said Mr. Muniz, referring to clients who had anticipated using the cartons to ship goods that in the end had no buyers. “We are trying to negotiate.”He has resorted to delaying some shipments until customers make a payment. And, thanks to his business office’s reminders that credit card payments are accepted, about 15 percent of his financially strapped customers now pay that way.Even though the fees Mr. Muniz must pay to credit card companies reduce his profits, he said bearing that cost was better than receiving no payment at all. And he said that credit charges allowed clients an extra 30 days to pay.“Many of my clients are embarrassed,” Mr. Muniz said, adding that they felt remorse over not being able to pay, as well as “pride in wanting to pay.”Early this year, Yin Chang, owner of Phoenix Marketing Communications in Montclair, N.J., which focuses on technology businesses, found herself with a client owing a five-figure amount. Ms. Chang worked out a payment plan and even offered to reduce the debt further if the client sent new business her way.The experience led her to incorporate new terms in her standard contract, which all clients must sign. She now adds 20 percent interest to all payments that are 60 days past due, and she cuts off services to clients with bills 90 days past due.“I feel a little safer,” Ms. Chang said, adding that her clients had not been deterred by these new measures. “I don’t think any C.E.O. would sign a contract like that unless they felt confident they could pay.” Her strategy has also caught on. Three of the five business owners she regularly meets with, and who are especially worried about start-up companies’ ability to pay on time, have added similar clauses to their contracts.“The minute business owners fail to recognize that by providing goods and services they become their customer’s bank, they put themselves at risk for inappropriately underwriting their customers,” said Morris Bocian, a business consultant and owner of Creative Business Planning in Livingston, N.J.To protect itself, a company can set a policy that allows it to be paid on a continuing basis as goals are achieved, he said. Or businesses can collect payments in advance, mitigating the risk that the customer will not pay.Mr. Bocian cautioned, however, that a contract was only as good as a business owner’s willingness to live by it. “You put your company at risk the moment you fail to enforce the terms,” he said.Although in the last six months only a few of Mr. Bocian’s clients said they had been worried about slow payments or that companies that owe them money might go bankrupt, he expects anxiety to heighten. “Ultimately, the fear is that their receivables will become uncollectible,” he said.When such a possibility arises, experts say, it is important to act quickly.“Your ability to collect is greater when debt is new, because once a company is out of business there’s nothing to collect,” said Jocelyn Nager, the president of Frank, Frank, Goldstein & Nager, a law firm in New York. Her company collects bad debt under a contingency arrangement; they are paid only if they collect. “You want to be the first of all creditors to get paid.”Often a company that is owed money will hire a collection agency, which is legally allowed to pursue debtors by phone or in writing, Ms. Nager said. But if the agency is unsuccessful, it may subcontract the work to a law firm, which means additional fees for the client.“It’s less costly to hire a collections lawyer directly, and it’s often the more expedient move, because commercial claims are usually not paid without a lawsuit,” she said.Often getting paid comes down to how much the client needs the services of the creditor, said Ken Morrow, a certified public accountant and the owner of Bookkeeping USA, which has offices in Manhattan and Brooklyn. He recommends that his clients go to small claims court to collect.“The moment a company realizes its clients do not intend to pay, because they won’t set a time frame for or an amount of payment, it’s off to court,” Mr. Morrow said. In most cases, he said, companies wait until the last minute and pay before the court appointment.Rick Jensen, a senior vice president at Intuit, said small businesses were paying more attention to back office functions, like tracking every dollar of accounts receivable. “You need to become more organized and rigorous.”Mr. Ip is sticking with what works. He is planning another event this year and if necessary, he said, he will work out a catering arrangement with another food company that owes him money.It is important to maintain good relationships and be creative with payment arrangements to show good faith, he says. What’s more, Mr. Ip said, he felt strongly that even in a sluggish economy, businesses needed to keep growing.“Being flexible with our clients helps them,” he said. “And it also helps us.”'"
"'08-11-13,'1','The five managers to testify before the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform were selected because they each earned more than $1 billion in 2007. They range from industry veterans like Mr. Soros, who is known for his liberal political views and donations, to traders like Mr. Paulson, who foresaw the problems in the subprime mortgage market and made billions betting against mortgage investments.“Some experts call them the shadow banking system because they operate almost entirely unregulated,” said Representative Henry A. Waxman, Democrat of California, the chairman of the committee. “Very little is known about how they operate and the types of systemic risk they can generate.”As policy makers consider overhauling the rules that apply to mortgage lenders, bankers and investors, hedge funds may also face new requirements for the disclosure of their trading methods. The Federal Reserve and other regulatory agencies have been studying the effects of hedge funds on the market, and questions linger over what the government would do if a large hedge fund began to collapse.“On Capital Hill, there certainly is appetite for more hedge fund regulation,” said Houman B. Shadab, a senior research fellow at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University, who will testify at the House hearing. “It’s not obvious to me that hedge funds caused this crisis, but they have been affected by it, there’s no doubt about that.”Three of the hedge fund managers who are testifying are facing huge losses. Mr. Griffin, who started trading in the 1980s out of his Harvard dorm room, has two funds down more than 30 percent this year. His company, Citadel Investment Group, is viewed as a bellwether for the industry because it trades in most types of assets, but two of his funds are down more than the 20 percent that is the average loss among hedge funds, according to estimates from Hedge Fund Research, a firm in Chicago that tracks the industry.Mr. Falcone, a stock-picker who runs Harbinger Capital, is down after a disastrous September and October.Mr. Simons is a former mathematics professor who runs Renaissance Technologies, a secretive trading operation in Long Island that makes bets based on computer models. One of Renaissance’s institutional stock funds is down 14 percent this year. However, Renaissance marketed the fund as one that would beat the broader stock market, which it is doing.Hedge funds already follow some regulations. Funds that trade in commodities, for instance, have to disclose some holdings to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. And large hedge funds are required to publicly disclose substantial stock holdings through the Securities and Exchange Commission. Since September, hedge funds have also disclosed short sales to the S.E.C., but not to the public.The industry’s association, the Managed Funds Association, and a group of hedge funds met with regulators in October to discuss the effects of the crisis. The president of the hedge fund association is Richard H. Baker, a Republican who represented a district in Louisiana in the House of Representatives until earlier this year. For 12 years, Mr. Baker was chairman of the subcommittee on capital markets within the House Financial Services Committee.Mr. Baker will not be attending the hearing because he was so recently a member of Congress. But analysts said he would be heavily involved in the battle to come over hedge funds.“He was an early warner about Fannie and Freddie,” said Robert Litan, vice president for research and policy at the Kauffman Foundation, an organization dedicated to the promotion of entrepreneurship. “He’ll say, ‘Look, I called Fannie and Freddie correctly. I know a crisis when I see it.’ ”'"
"'08-11-13,'1','If you love XM radio so much that you never want to stop listening, now there’s a way to get five times as much. Pioneer’s XMp3 model, now shipping to retailers, is the first unit to allow listeners to record up to five channels of XM radio simultaneously, and store up to 100 hours of programming.The XMp3, which weighs 3.1 ounces and is priced at $280, can also record up to 10 hours of individual songs and, through a micro-SD card, play MP3 songs that have been downloaded from a PC. If you don’t want to miss a beat, a channel can also be buffered, meaning users can pause, back up and fast-forward, much as they would a DVR, for a 30-minute period.Borrowing another feature from DVRs, the unit has an electronic program guide that shows programming up to two weeks in advance, allowing users to schedule their listening far ahead. The unit can also alert you when your favorite team, singer or program is on the radio, so you can get an N.F.L./Rihanna/Car Talk fix whenever it’s available. ERIC A. TAUB'"
"'08-11-13,'1','Google announced on Wednesday that it would begin selling space on YouTube search-results pages to advertisers, part of its effort to turn its expensive acquisition into a major revenue producer.The feature allows anyone who has a video on YouTube to promote it on a search-results page. An advertiser — or a video maker who wants to promote a work — can bid on keywords like “silly cats,” “financial crisis,” “James Bond,” or anything that strikes one’s fancy.The promoted videos are featured on the right-hand side of the YouTube search-results page with a small image and some text.Advertisers are charged when a viewer clicks on the ad, and can set a maximum price per click that they want to pay. Google determines which ads will be shown based on what price the advertisers bid, along with factors like relevance to the keyword, which is similar to the way it selects ads shown on Google’s regular search results.A search product for YouTube makes sense — it had the third-highest number of search queries of any Web property in September, after Google and Yahoo, according to comScore, the online measurement firm.'"
"'08-11-13,'1','Its warning echoes the sentiments of Cisco Systems, the leading maker of network equipment, which said last week that a “completely different environment” had taken hold in October as the financial crisis spread from Wall Street and across the globe. Cisco’s sales could drop 10 percent in the second quarter, the company said.Intel issued its new forecast after the stock market closed on Wednesday, accompanying grim news from two other leading companies in the semiconductor industry.Applied Materials, which produces equipment used by semiconductor makers, reported a 45 percent drop in fourth-quarter profit to $231 million, down from $422 million in the period last year. Sales tumbled 14 percent, to $2.04 billion from $2.37 billion.Applied, based in Santa Clara, Calif., said it planned to cut 1,800 jobs — or close to 12 percent of its staff — over the next year. It expects to save about $400 million a year from the staff cuts.Mimicking Intel, National Semiconductor lowered its sales forecast for the current quarter by more than 10 percent. It had expected revenue of $470 million to $480 million for the period ending Nov. 23, but is now looking for revenue of $420 million to $425 million. National Semiconductor is also based in Santa Clara.Last week, Advanced Micro Devices, Intel’s main rival, revealed plans to lay off 500 people, or close to 3 percent of its work force. In addition, mobile semiconductor supplier Qualcomm has pulled back on hiring and research projects while complaining of a sudden reduction in orders from mobile device customers.The recent downturn in sales further depresses a semiconductor market that had been suffering from a glut of memory chips and intense competition on price.Shares of Intel dropped nearly 3 percent, to $13.52, in trading on Wednesday. After the release of the fourth-quarter forecast, Intel’s shares fell more than 7 percent in after-hours trading.On Oct. 14, Intel’s chief executive, Paul S. Otellini, was vaguely cautious in his outlook, saying only that “some customers” were feeling pressure as a result of the financial crisis, while others were unaffected.Intel tried to accommodate this uncertainty by providing a wider-than-usual range in its fourth-quarter revenue forecast. But chip sales dropped so precipitously that the company was forced to revise the numbers before a planned midquarter update.If Intel’s fourth-quarter revenue comes in at the low end of its forecast, the 19 percent drop in sales would be the biggest since the fourth quarter of 2001, when sales dropped 20 percent.The warnings from the large semiconductor players mean that consumer electronics and computer companies will probably have a difficult holiday season. Best Buy, the leading electronics retailer, offered its own bleak forecast Wednesday, and its rival, Circuit City Stores, filed for bankruptcy protection Monday.“People don’t have any money left to buy cool gadgets,” said Trip Chowdhry, an analyst at Global Equities Research, adding that the housing debacle has drained consumer budgets.In the next few months, Mr. Chowdhry expects a spate of job cuts in Silicon Valley.“It will be almost across the board in the region,” he said. “Three percent to 10 percent of the people will get laid off.”'"
"'08-11-13,'1','But the swift resignation was not met with cheers by those on either side.Marc Shaiman, the Tony Award-winning composer (“Hairspray”), called Mr. Eckern last week and said that he would not let his work be performed in the theater. “I was uncomfortable with money made off my work being used to put discrimination in the Constitution,” Mr. Shaiman said. He added, however, that the entire episode left him “deeply troubled” because of the potential for backlash against gays who protested Mr. Eckern’s donation.“It will not help our cause because we will be branded exactly as what we were trying to fight,” said Mr. Shaiman, who is gay. “But I do believe there comes a time when you cannot sit back and accept what I think is the most dangerous form of bigotry.”Supporters of the marriage ban said that critics of Mr. Eckern were attacking freedom of expression, and they chastised the theater’s board for subjecting Mr. Eckern to a political litmus test.“No matter your opinion on Prop. 8, we should all agree that it is wrong to intimidate or harass anyone for exercising their constitutional rights,” said a letter to the theater’s board president on Tuesday by Frank Schubert, campaign manager for Protect Marriage, the leading group behind the ballot measure.For its part, the theater disavowed Mr. Eckern’s donation and issued only a brief statement on Wednesday accepting his resignation, while emphasizing that it would not “impinge on the rights of its employees to engage in political activities.” A longtime employee, Mr. Eckern had been artistic director since 2002.The outrage over Mr. Eckern and the subsequent dismay voiced by Mr. Shaiman are the most recent evidence of the tension running through the entertainment industry since Election Day, particularly in California.Several prominent gay entertainers have expressed anger about the vote, including the singer Melissa Etheridge, who said she would refuse to pay California state taxes because she was “not a full citizen” and called on other gay men and women to do the same.The sense of disappointment over the vote extended to Broadway. Jeffrey Seller, a producer of the show “Avenue Q,” which is scheduled to be part of the 2008-9 season at the California Musical Theater, said he had been shocked when he heard about Mr. Eckern’s donation.“That a man who makes his living exclusively through the musical theater could do something so hurtful to the community that forms his livelihood is a punch in the stomach,” Mr. Seller said. “He didn’t just vote for it. One thousand dollars is a lot of money for an artistic director of a nonprofit.”Mr. Seller said that he had not considered canceling the “Avenue Q” engagement with the theater company — “We don’t break contracts” — but had spoken to members of the show’s creative team on Tuesday about voicing their displeasure with Mr. Eckern in other ways, including adding a song addressing his donation. That idea has been dropped now.Mr. Eckern did not respond to requests for an interview made to an outside publicist and the production company, which books shows into three Sacramento theaters, including a handsome new cabaret a block from the governor’s mansion. In his statement Mr. Eckern said that he would donate $1,000 to a gay-rights group, adding that he respected gay people, including a sister who is a lesbian.“I am loving and supportive of her and her family, and she is loving and supportive of me and my family,” said Mr. Eckern, who is married with children. “I definitely do not support any message or treatment of others that is hateful or instills fear.”Susan Egan, a Broadway actress (“Beauty and the Beast”) who landed her first professional job at the California Musical Theater, said she had been saddened by both Mr. Eckern’s actions and her own involvement, which included posting a letter on her Facebook page supporting the idea of boycotting the theater.“My actions have caused him harm, just as his actions caused harm to people he loved,” she said. “We’re all guilty.”That sentiment was echoed by Mr. Shaiman, who said that some of the pain being felt among gay theater artists after passage of Proposition 8 has been self-inflicted.“Our anger is against ourselves, too, that we were too compliant,” he said. “It was beyond our ken that this could ever happen. But we were terribly, terribly wrong.”'"
"'08-11-13,'1','Iceland’s prime minister, Geir H. Haarde, said in an e-mailed statement that his government was still working on the loan package, and that Poland had offered to participate. He said Iceland was seeking to resolve the compensation issue with Britain and the Netherlands.“I think it is unfortunate if they or anyone else tries to block our case at the I.M.F. board because of that,” he said. “We regard these as two separate matters and that the Icesave issue should be resolved on its own merits. I hope that the executive board of the I.M.F. will put our economic plan on the agenda as soon as possible.”The Icelandic currency and the country’s stock market began collapsing in September, as the global credit crisis made it impossible for banks and businesses to roll over heavy foreign-currency debts. Financial institutions in the country overextended themselves during the era of easy credit.In October, the government stepped in to nationalize the three Icelandic banks — Glitnir, Landsbanki and Kaupthing — which together made up 90 percent of the financial system. Since then, officials have been seeking to arrange international support to stave off an economic collapse.The international repercussions of the bank failures have complicated matters. Savers in much of Northern Europe deposited money with the local units of Icelandic banks, which offered relatively high interest rates.British charities and local government organizations had deposited more than £1 billion, or $1.7 billion, in Icelandic banks. Lenders in Austria, Britain, Germany and the Netherlands have also reported exposure to the banks.Wouter Bos, the Netherlands finance minister, told Dutch television on Tuesday that he opposed any monetary fund bailout unless Iceland compensated Dutch savers.The Dutch lent the Icelandic government 1.3 billion euros, or $1.7 billion, to help it pay back Dutch depositors. Iceland has not said how or whether that would be repaid.Gordon Brown, the British prime minister, has called Iceland’s unwillingness to compensate savers “totally unacceptable and illegal,” and he has even threatened to use antiterrorist legislation to take over assets of Icelandic companies in Britain.“We think it’s important that Iceland resolves its issues with other countries before the I.M.F. grants the loan,” Hendrienke Bolhaar, a spokeswoman for Mr. Bos, said Wednesday.'"
"'08-11-13,'1','Unfortunately the good feeling didn’t last. Soon I had to start wearing two pairs at once. If only, like Gwyneth, I could have stopped there.But I graduated to the harder stuff. I moved on to the Slim Cognito Body Shaping Cami and the Hide & Sleek Full Slip, as well. Yet each time a new layer magically smoothed one bulge, another popped out like a balloon sculpture of a dachshund.Despite the company’s warnings, I kept going. “If you go with more than two layers, it’s Spanx abuse and you need to get help,” a Spanx spokeswoman warned me.But before I knew it, I was wrapped so tightly that one night at dinner I warned my husband, “If I pass out, call the ambulance and make sure they bring the Jaws of Life.”“I’ll bet they can cut you out of that stuff in no time,” he said encouragingly.“But stand back,” I warned. “When the cami goes, it could take your eye out.”I can’t live like that anymore. Nor can I see adopting some of the more desperate measures recommended by my 40-something circle, whose secrets include the Eat Like a Gorilla lifestyle (“Eat as much as you want, even shovel it in with your hands, as long as it’s whole heads of lettuce,” my friend Stephanie said) and a three-week detox diet involving an endless number of puréed carrots and smelly green supplement pills. “I didn’t chew once,” my friend Stacy marveled. “By the end, I wondered if my jaw muscles would atrophy.”Instead, I vowed around Labor Day to start to fight back the old-fashioned way: with exercise.Despite the dispiriting results of preliminary research, which suggested that on a typical day my traitorous body burned only about 1,600 calories — roughly the amount I consume by 10 a.m. — I figured I could whip it back into shape with a combination of yoga (two classes a week) and four 45-minute workouts a week on the elliptical or treadmill machines at my town’s community center gym.I wish I could report all went well. But I experienced an early setback upon arriving at the gym, the first time, at midmorning (after exhausting the day’s calorie allotment) only to learn that machine use was limited to 30 minutes a person — although the clientele (super-fit retirees, mainly) seemed to have a lot of time on their hands to exercise. Or maybe it was because of this, come to think of it. In any case, I was the only person not wily enough to bring a magazine to put on a little ledge where it could hide the elliptical’s time-display readout. A septuagenarian body builder kicked me off at precisely 30:01.But I persevered, religiously adhering to my onerous routine until I climbed onto a scale about a month into the program.I looked in a mirror, pointed a finger at my double-crossing corpulence and declared all-out war.I will always remember last month as one of my saddest because that was when I cut back on drinking. The hardest part wasn’t giving up white wine most nights (estimated calorie savings: 1,000 a week). It was withstanding the entreaties of my family and friends, who were always trying to pour me a glass on the grounds that, as one of my daughters put it, “It makes you so happy, which makes everyone around you happier.”Unfortunately, the chardonnay cutback wasn’t enough. After two months, when the scale delivered another troubling verdict — by now I had managed to lose a total of only three pounds — I realized this problem was too big for one peri-menopausal woman with a limited understanding of physiology to solve alone.I offered myself as a research subject to the Mayo Clinic.“At this point I run more miles per week on a treadmill than anyone I’ve ever heard of,” I said to Dr. Maria Collazo-Clavell, a Mayo endocrinologist who specializes in talking weight-gaining women of a certain age off the ledge. “If I had done this much exercise when I was in my 30s, I’d be so thin by now you couldn’t see me.”She refused to sugarcoat the future, saying bluntly: “It takes a lot more effort to lose pounds than it did before the change in your metabolism.” But she did offer hope.“Mix it up,” she suggested. “You can’t keep increasing the aerobic forever, running more and more, however many times around the world. Add weight training or resistance exercises to work out specific muscle groups and you’ll see your body change shape.”Great. I hate that stuff. But I can see this is one of those situations — like when you’re in the late stages of labor and the delivery nurses start yelling “push, push” at a time when you’d really prefer not to — when you can’t ignore the problem until it goes away.So November is the month when I added chest presses and triceps curls and leg extensions to my routine. I can’t tell how much this is helping yet. But I hope it will hold me until Spanx invents a Head-to-Toe Sausage Encasing Slimderizer.'"
"'08-11-13,'1','Soon after the beginning of Bebe Miller’s “Necessary Beauty,” which opened at Dance Theater Workshop on Tuesday night, a question popped into my head. It was a familiar question, often asked by friends who come with me to dance performances: What does it mean?It’s a question to which I usually respond, “I have no idea.” Then I talk about the importance of letting random thoughts and associations about a work live happily in your consciousness without forcing them to resolve into meaning. But as the six dancers in Ms. Miller’s piece moved in front of two screens showing mutating video — of the sea, a painterly mountain scene, a forest evolving through the seasons — it was hard to avoid the sense that a narrative lurked just out of reach, that the dancers had access to something that the audience couldn’t grasp.Ms. Miller’s movement style is scrappy, almost careless looking. The dancers move with discrete, small steps, stopping and starting, shoulders hunching and dropping, torsos angling backward, then jerking upright, arms thrown into the air.It’s so natural looking that it’s only after a while that you understand how much Ms. Miller asks of her dancers in the quick changes of weight and tone, the extreme precision of the disconnected movement and its innate musical nuance.When Ms. Miller herself appears, well into the piece, that movement becomes legible and logical, a kind of physical thinking out loud. And it’s at that point that a female voice begins to speak, offering random comments (“I saw my neighborhood from when I was little”) over the strongly varied rhythms of the live electronic score by Albert Mathias.As the faces of the dancers fill the screen (the quality of the animation, by Vita Berezina-Blackburn, and the video, by Maya Ciarrocchi, is remarkably vivid), the disembodied voice continues to offer snippets of memory and reflections about the past. The dancers move in and out of group formations, frequently breaking away to perform alone, and suddenly “Necessary Beauty” has effected one of those magical theatrical transformations when what has felt random is unexpectedly filled with allusive mystery.'"
"'08-11-13,'1','The Justice Department, in a statement, noted that the price-fixing conspiracy affected screens sold to American companies, and cited three by name: Dell, Apple and Motorola. Those companies, and others, could have the basis for private suits.The LCD business is a $100-billion-a-year market and growing, but prices are falling relentlessly. Recently, panel prices have often been cut in half each year, a downward trajectory even steeper than in other technology markets known for steady price pressure, like those for computer chips and hard drives.In the last six months alone, the price of a 15.4-inch panel for a notebook PC has dropped to $63, from $97, and a 32-inch LCD for a television has gone to $223, from $321, according to iSuppli, a market research firm.The price-fixing conspiracy, industry analysts said, was an effort to slow the speed of price declines. “These companies were trying to get a toehold to protect profits in a very difficult market,” said Richard Doherty, director of research at Envisioneering, a technology consulting firm.Without the price-fixing scheme, liquid-crystal panels would have been even cheaper, and they are important parts in a wide range of products. For example, the screen represents 10 to 20 percent of the total cost of a notebook PC, said Rob Enderle, an independent analyst in San Jose, Calif.The effect was somewhat higher prices. “These price-fixing conspiracies affected millions of American consumers who use computers, cellphones and numerous other household electronics every day,” Mr. Barnett said in a statement.The settlement, legal specialists say, does not precisely indicate the extent of the consumer harm. Under antitrust law, a company can be fined up to twice the gain it derived from its misconduct.But in a settlement, the fine amounts could represent negotiated levels, or less than the total harm to consumers, said C. Scott Hemphill, an antitrust expert at the Columbia University law school.“And this settlement only deals with the harm in the United States,” he said. “The global totals may be many times larger.”During the Bush administration, antitrust enforcement has been selective and often guided by a hands-off, pro-business philosophy, legal experts say. But price-fixing cartels are an area of antitrust in which there is no debate about enforcement. In a 2004 Supreme Court decision, which was unanimous, cartels were called “the supreme evil of antitrust.”“Cartels are regarded as the most dangerous form of anticompetitive conduct,” said Andrew I. Gavil, a law professor at Howard University. “The reason is that the potential impact on consumers is so great, and there is no plausible justification for it.”With the settlement, Mr. Barnett, who will leave the Justice Department next week, has provided “an answer to critics who doubted he would take on big cases of this kind,” Mr. Gavil said.'"
"'08-11-13,'1','Despite the mind-boggling amount of money that Congress has authorized the Treasury to spend — $350 billion immediately, and another $350 billion that Congress would approve under a fast-track procedure — Mr. Paulson is running short of money and time.The news that the government will not buy soured mortgage assets, along with a string of poor corporate earnings, disheartened investors on Wednesday, sending the markets down for a third straight day this week. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 411.30 points, or 4.7 percent, to close at 8,282.66.The Treasury has already committed about $290 billion. It has allocated $125 billion to the nation’s nine biggest banks and investment banks; another $125 billion for publicly traded regional banks; and $40 billion to expand the existing bailout of , the insurance conglomerate that collapsed in September.Mr. Paulson alluded to the consumer credit plan vaguely in a news conference on Wednesday, and some Fed officials cautioned that they had seen few details. But Treasury officials said such a plan would give them the biggest bang for the buck and might be enacted within several weeks.Mr. Paulson conceded that he had scrapped the plan he originally sold to Congress in September, which was to have the Treasury Department buy hundreds of billions of dollars worth of illiquid mortgage-backed securities in order to free up banks to resume normal lending.The program is still called the Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP, but it will not buy troubled assets. “Our assessment at this time is that this is not the most effective way to use TARP funds,” Mr. Paulson said.Instead, Treasury will step up its program of injecting capital directly into banks and, for the first time, expand it to include financial companies that are not federally regulated banks or thrifts.Mr. Paulson made it clear he would not use Treasury money to help bail out the automobile industry, rebuffing pleas from , and as well as from top House and Senate Democrats.But Mr. Paulson left open the prospect of providing backdoor support to the car companies by offering to recapitalize nonbank financial companies like GE Capital and CIT Financial, and the financing subsidiaries of Ford, Chrysler andHouse Democrats are already drafting legislation that would provide ’s Big Three with an additional $25 billion, on top of $25 billion in low-interest loans that are supposed to be used for retooling factories for energy-efficient cars.“The consequences of a collapse of the American automobile industry would be particularly troublesome,” said , Democrat of and chairman of the House Financial Services Committee. Mr. Frank said the assistance would come with strict conditions aimed at protecting taxpayers.Some Republican lawmakers have already objected, saying the effort would amount to throwing good money after bad. But the White House on Wednesday left the door open to a legislative compromise with Congress.“I know the automakers are important to the ,” Mr. Paulson said. “We care about the automobile industry.” But he cautioned that “my focus is on the financial sector — getting credit going, getting lending going.”White House and Treasury officials have been devising policy on the fly for months now, as what began as a panic over losses on subprime mortgages broadened into a crisis that wreaked havoc on Wall Street, at major commercial banks and in the broader economy itself.In September, Mr. Paulson went to Congress and urgently pressed for authority to spend as much as $700 billion to unclog the nation’s financial pipelines by buying up unsellable securities from banks and other financial institutions.But by the time Congress approved the bailout law in early October, Mr. Paulson and the chairman of the Federal Reserve, , were already shifting to a strategy he had actually opposed: buying equity stakes directly in American banks, a move that was reminiscent of European-style nationalization.As recently as a few days ago, Treasury officials insisted that they still intended to buy up the troubled assets. But by late October, it had become clear that Plan A had become little more than a sideshow.“Illiquid assets looked like the way to go,” Mr. Paulson told reporters at a news conference on Wednesday. But as economic and financial conditions declined so rapidly, he said, that he had to change gears. “I will never apologize for changing the approach and the strategy when the facts change,” he said.The change in strategy has had only limited impact on the frozen credit markets. The biggest improvement has been in the willingness of banks to lend to each other, a change that largely caused by the willingness of both the United States and European governments to guarantee bank deposits and interbank loans.But the market for commercial debt backed by consumer and business loans has remained at a near standstill since , one of Wall Street’s leading investment banks, collapsed in September.Borrowing costs for credit card issuers are at least five percentage points higher than they were before the began. Financing costs for automobile lenders are even higher. Even student loans that are guaranteed by the federal government have been difficult to finance.“You have a market that is frozen,” said Alex Roever, an analyst at .To stretch his resources, Mr. Paulson told reporters he was examining ideas to have private investors contribute capital alongside Treasury.Mr. Paulson also made it clear he did not want to use bailout money to refinance the mortgages of homeowners who are in danger of losing their homes to foreclosure. Democratic lawmakers and the chairman of the , , have been calling for the Treasury to spend $40 billion in a broad mortgage refinancing program.As envisioned by Treasury officials, the Federal Reserve would set up a new special-purpose lending entity, which would lend cash to investors or companies that put up collateral in the form of consumer loans. The Fed might lend up to 80 percent of the value of those loans, providing a cushion for taxpayers against losses.The Treasury would contribute 5 percent to 10 percent of the money to finance the lending. But the Fed would raise most of the money by selling what is known as nonrecourse to investors.Treasury officials said the plan would allow them to leverage the government’s money by as much as 20 to 1, meaning that the Treasury would provide 5 percent of the money and investors would provide 95 percent. Using $50 billion in money from the government rescue program, they said, could thus underwrite $1 trillion worth of lending for consumer loans.Such an arrangement would bear a similarity to exactly the highly leveraged, and eventually disastrous, special-investment vehicles that banks like created in countless numbers to hold, among other things, securities backed by subprime mortgages.Although the Treasury would contribute only a small share of the money for such a program, analysts said the plan would only overcome investor fears if the Treasury or the Federal Reserve provided some kind of backstop against losses. If that were to be the case, taxpayers would be indirectly liable for the entire volume of lending.Fed officials appeared to be taken aback by Mr. Paulson’s public reference to the idea, and cautioned that it was still in early development.“Both the structure and the parameters are under discussion and development,” said Michele A. Smith, a spokeswoman for the Fed.'"
"'08-11-13,'1','The fine for Saint-Gobain, though substantial, is not likely to cripple the company. It had net income of 2.1 billion euros ($2.6 billion) in 2007 on sales of 43.4 billion euros.Sophie Chevallon, a spokeswoman for Saint-Gobain, said the employees involved with the cartel had been demoted. She was unable to say whether they might face further disciplinary or legal action.In a statement, the company called the fine “excessive and disproportionate,” and said it planned to appeal the decision in European courts in Luxembourg. The fine represented “several decades” of profit for its automotive glass business in Europe, it said.Other companies involved were Asahi, a Japanese company, fined 113.5 million euros ($144 million), and Soliver, a Belgian company, fined 4.4 million euros ($5.6 million).The auto glass cartel came to light after an anonymous tip, Ms. Kroes said.Executives had met at airports and hotels in Brussels, Frankfurt and Paris to discuss contracts with automakers and the allocation of glass supplies for new models, she said.The result was that the European auto industry — currently struggling with plummeting sales as a global credit crisis tightens its grip — had been paying more than needed for windshields, windows and sunroofs.Prices were also higher than they should have been for branded replacement glass sold to consumers, she said, although the commission did not say by how much.European officials last week raided the offices of several big cement makers, including the French company Lafarge, fined in 2002 for participating in a plasterboard cartel, and HeidelbergCement, fined in 2003 by German authorities for rigging markets there.The fine against the glass makers was the largest fine against a single cartel in the European Union, topping the 992 million euros ($1.2 billion) levied against elevator makers last year. Even so, experts said that the efforts by the European Commission to raise penalties to ever-higher levels showed the limits of their enforcement abilities.Policy makers in the United States decided a decade ago that prison terms were the most effective way to deter cartel formation, said Julian Joshua, a former competition official at the commission.“Perceptions of acceptable behavior change when people who are members of your country club end up behind bars,” he said.Ms. Kroes said she was pressing to make it easier for consumers and industries that had been hurt by high prices from cartels to sue for damages, as in the United States. That could make discovery of price fixing even more costly for companies.Yet even in European countries where prison is an option, authorities have shied away from using such a strong sanction.Only Britain has imprisoned price fixers under a law passed in 2002 that makes cartel participation punishable by a sentence up to five years, Mr. Joshua said. France and Ireland have the option but have not imprisoned anyone.'"
"'08-11-13,'1','“This missile gives our military force a new capability,” he said. “It was produced as part of our deterrent policy. It will be for peace and security in the region, and we will only use it against enemies who invade the Islamic Republic.” He did not refer to any specific country.The news of the launching emerged a day after Iranian news media said that the Revolutionary Guards had test fired another new missile, known as the Samen, in the western city of Merivan, near the border with Iraq, on Monday.Iran is locked in a long-running dispute with the United States and other powers over its nuclear enrichment program. While Western nations suspect that Iran is seeking a nuclear weapon, Iran says it is enriching uranium solely for civilian purposes.In the past, Iran has announced new developments in missile technology in a manner that Westerners interpreted as saber-rattling to bolster its regional and international posture.Last July during a war game, Iran’s Revolutionary Guards test fired nine missiles, including at least one that the government in Tehran described as having the range to reach Israel.At the time, state-run news media said the missiles were long- and medium-range weapons, and included a Shahab-3, which Tehran maintains can hit targets up to 1,250 miles away from its firing position. Parts of western Iran are within 650 miles of Tel Aviv.Iran’s missile capacity is cited by the United States as one reason for an American plan to station an antimissile shield in eastern Europe — a project that has enraged Russia. In response, Moscow said last week that it would station short-range missiles in its Baltic enclave of Kaliningrad if the United States went ahead with its plan.Mr. Lennox, the editor of Jane’s Strategic Weapons Systems, said the new missile’s claimed range would not reach eastern Europe. “The worry would be that it would be used against Kuwait, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, Israel — anyone in the region the Iranians took a dislike to,” he said by telephone.The latest Iranian reports of missile test firings came after Iran said last week that American helicopters were spotted flying close to Iranian airspace.The Bush administration has consistently refused to rule out military action against Iran’s nuclear facilities. But President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad insisted on Wednesday that Iran would continue to seek access to “nuclear technology’s know-how.”He also suggested that Iran would look closely for any shift in American policy following the election of Senator Barack Obama as president. “It doesn’t make a difference who comes and who leaves,” Mr. Ahmadinejad said in a speech broadcast live on state-run television from the northern city of Sari. “It is actions that will be carefully watched by Iranians and other nations in the world.”According to the IRNA news agency, he continued: “Whoever talks with the great people of Iran with the language of force or in a rude, selfish and impolite tone would receive a clear response from the Iranian nation.”'"

"'08-11-14,'0','Not so long ago, corporate giants with names like PanAm, ITT and Ward roamed the earth. They faded and were replaced by new companies with names like , and Target. The U.S. became famous for this pattern of decay and new growth. Over time, American government built a bigger safety net so workers could survive the vicissitudes of this creative destruction — with unemployment insurance and soon, one hopes, health care security. But the government has generally not interfered in the dynamic process itself, which is the source of the country’s prosperity.But this, apparently, is about to change. Democrats from to want to grant immortality to , and . They have decided to follow an earlier $25 billion loan with a $50 billion , which would inevitably be followed by more billions later, because if these companies are not permitted to go bankrupt now, they never will be.This is a different sort of endeavor than the $750 billion bailout of Wall Street. That money was used to save the financial system itself. It was used to save the capital markets on which the process of creative destruction depends.Granting immortality to ’s Big Three does not enhance creative destruction. It retards it. It crosses a line, a bright line. It is not about saving a system; there will still be cars made and sold in America. It is about saving politically powerful corporations. A Detroit bailout would set a precedent for every single politically connected corporation in America. There already is a long line of lobbyists bidding for federal money. If Detroit gets money, then everyone would have a case. After all, are the employees of Circuit City or the newspaper industry inferior to the employees of Chrysler?It is all a reminder that the biggest threat to a healthy economy is not the socialists of campaign lore. It’s C.E.O.’s. It’s politically powerful crony capitalists who use their influence to create a stagnant corporate welfare state.If ever the market has rendered a just verdict, it is the one rendered on and Chrysler. These companies are not innocent victims of this crisis. To read the expert literature on these companies is to read a long litany of miscalculation. Some experts mention the management blunders, some the union contracts and the legacy costs, some the years of poor car design and some the entrenched corporate cultures.'"

"'08-11-14,'0','The economic news, in case you haven’t noticed, keeps getting worse. Bad as it is, however, I don’t expect another Great . In fact, we probably won’t see the unemployment rate match its post-Depression peak of 10.7 percent, reached in 1982 (although I wish I was sure about that).We are already, however, well into the realm of what I call depression economics. By that I mean a state of affairs like that of the 1930s in which the usual tools of economic policy — above all, the ’s ability to pump up the economy by cutting interest rates — have lost all traction. When depression economics prevails, the usual rules of economic policy no longer apply: virtue becomes vice, caution is risky and prudence is folly.To see what I’m talking about, consider the implications of the latest piece of terrible economic news: Thursday’s report on new claims for unemployment insurance, which have now passed the half-million mark. Bad as this report was, viewed in isolation it might not seem catastrophic. After all, it was in the same ballpark as numbers reached during the 2001 recession and the 1990-1991 recession, both of which ended up being relatively mild by historical standards (although in each case it took a long time before the job market recovered).But on both of these earlier occasions the standard policy response to a weak economy — a cut in the federal funds rate, the interest rate most directly affected by Fed policy — was still available. Today, it isn’t: the effective federal funds rate (as opposed to the official target, which for technical reasons has become meaningless) has averaged less than 0.3 percent in recent days. Basically, there’s nothing left to cut.And with no possibility of further interest rate cuts, there’s nothing to stop the economy’s downward momentum. Rising unemployment will lead to further cuts in consumer spending, which warned this week has already suffered a “seismic” decline. Weak consumer spending will lead to cutbacks in business investment plans. And the weakening economy will lead to more job cuts, provoking a further cycle of .To pull us out of this downward spiral, the federal government will have to provide economic stimulus in the form of higher spending and greater aid to those in distress — and the won’t come soon enough or be strong enough unless politicians and economic officials are able to transcend several conventional prejudices.'"

"'08-11-14,'0','Gov. Theodore R. Kulongoski of Oregon, a Democrat, said the provisional agreement would be “a model not only for the West but the rest of the country of how the federal and state governments and private industry can work together.”Thursday’s agreement follows the announcement nine months ago of a rapprochement between most of the warring groups, which joined in signing a roadmap for restoring the quality and vitality of the Klamath River by removing the dams. But PacifiCorp said it would not agree to their removal until the financial interests of the company’s customers were safeguarded.The new agreement, which is expected to be final by June 2009, provides specifics on financing the dam removal. PacifiCorp, which is a subsidiary of the MidAmerican Energy Holding Company and operates as Pacific Power on the West Coast — would add a 2 percent annual surcharge, amounting to about $15 on average, for its 550,000 customers in Oregon and 45,000 in California.In addition to the $200 million generated in part by these surcharges, $250 million would be raised by a bond issued by California. The dams would also be transferred to a private agency set up for the purpose by a new federal law, relieving PacifiCorp of liability during the actual removal.The agreement also sets out a requirement for several years of scientific analysis of how removing the dams would affect water quality and fish habitat. The aim is to ensure that the environmental impact of the release of sediment would not be worse than leaving the dams in place. The oldest dam was installed more than a century ago.The Interior Department would make a final decision on removing the dams in 2012.The provisional nature of the agreement prompted supporters to curb their enthusiasm, but most said they believed the dams would be removed.“We absolutely believe this will become final,” said Dean Brockbank, the vice president and general counsel of PacifiCorp. Mr. Brockbank added, however, that “we recognize there are hurdles to achieving a final agreement,” like the need for a new federal law allowing transfer of the dams to federal ownership.In a reference to the impending change of leadership in Washington, Art Sasse, a spokesman for PacifiCorp, said: “It’s a flexible framework that recognizes that the administration is going to be passing the baton. But science — unbiased, unadulterated science — drives this process.”Two major environmental groups, American Rivers and Trout Unlimited, offered immediate support for the proposal, as did representatives of the farm communities and the Indian tribes based along the river.Greg Addington, the executive director of the Klamath Water Users Association, which serves more than 1,200 farm and ranching families, said that even though his constituency “believes we should be building more dams, not taking them out,” his members “have been pretty practical over the years in looking at this as an alternative that might happen.”Steve Rothert, a spokesman for American Rivers, an environmental group, said Thursday: “This is a bell that PacifiCorp will not be able to unring. They are clearly stating their intent to remove these dams because this is a good business deal for them.”For the company, the alternative to removing the dams would be renewing its long-term license, which would have required it to spend hundreds of millions of dollars on new systems and structures to mitigate the impact on salmon.'"
"'08-11-14,'0','The Treasury’s about-face on Wednesday, when it officially abandoned its original strategy of buying troubled assets from banks, did little to ease investors’ anxiety.The Bush administration now says it will try to jump-start the stalled credit markets with new lending programs, rather than by buying troubled assets from banks. But the line for help at the Treasury keeps getting longer. A big commercial lender, the CIT Group, applied to become a bank on Thursday in hopes of qualifying for rescue money. American Express took the same step earlier this week. And then, of course, there is the beleaguered auto industry.“What hasn’t improved is the psychology,” said Max Bublitz, chief strategist at SCM Advisors, an investment firm based in San Francisco. “This thing has morphed from a credit market issue into a banking crisis into an economic crisis.”Some parts of the credit markets have gotten better. Commercial paper rates have fallen markedly in the last few weeks, as have key rates like the London interbank offered rate, or Libor, the benchmark for trillions of dollars of corporate loans and home mortgages. The three-month Libor has fallen to 2.15 percent, from 4.82 percent in early October, when many banks were reluctant to lend to each other.But other parts of the markets remain frozen. Borrowing costs are still elevated for creditworthy companies, as well as for state and local governments. Even banks that are getting money from the government are reluctant to lend, much to the government’s consternation. The vast market for bonds backed by credit card debt, auto loans and student loans has effectively shut down. No new credit card securities have been issued since the crisis reached a fever pitch in September.The Treasury has thrown a lot of money at the problem. During the last month, the government pumped nearly $300 billion into more than 40 banks and financial companies, including the American International Group, the tottering insurance giant. Banks have until Friday to apply for money under the original program.So far, the Treasury has identified only a handful of the recipients. The government says it does not want to stigmatize companies for accepting — or being refused — government money.The takers include nine big banks that are likely to dominate the new landscape of American banking, among them Bank of America, Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo, as well as the humbled Wall Street giants Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley. The rest of the money is going to more than 30 banks, big and small, spread across the country.But now that the Treasury has abandoned its plan to buy the toxic assets of banks, other companies, including insurers and student loan companies, are lining up too. Many on Wall Street say they believe that the cost of the rescue is certain to exceed the $700 billion that was originally designated for it.“Let’s be realistic, $700 billion is not enough,” H. Rodgin Cohen, the chairman of Sullivan & Cromwell and one of the pre-eminent lawyers for Wall Street firms, said at a conference hosted by The Deal magazine on Wednesday. “I think it’s the ‘T-word,’ ” he said, referring to $1 trillion.While many of the banks have yet to receive their money from the Treasury, few are rushing to make the loans that companies and consumers need to cushion the economic slump.Take Cascade Financial, a community bank based in Everett, Wash. Hurt by investments in the mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, Cascade intends to use the $39 million it hopes to get from the government to bolster its own balance sheet. Only then will it consider lending.“As a bank, we’d like to make prudent loans,” said Lars H. Johnson, Cascade’s chief financial officer. “If we have the capital wherewithal, we’d do that. But we have to weigh that against what’s going on in the economy.”Beginning with $125 billion given to the nine large banks, the government has worked its way down to small community lenders. But not all of those banks are in dire shape.Consider Saigon National, a one-branch, three-year-old bank in Orange County, Calif., that bills itself as the hometown lender of the local Vietnamese community. Saigon National is set to receive $1.5 million, even though a key measure of the bank’s financial strength was four times as high as the minimum required by regulators.For John J. Kennedy, Saigon National’s chief executive, applying for a piece of the bailout was an easy decision. His bank was well capitalized, he said. But getting an additional $1.5 million for the tiny firm — the smallest preliminary award announced by any bank so far — would accelerate its growth plans tremendously.“I said, ‘Let’s move it up, let’s take the money while it’s available,’ ” he said.Unlike many other banks, Mr. Kennedy said, Saigon National will use the government money as Congress apparently intended: to make loans to its community. Other banks hope to use the money to acquire weaker rivals and bring about a rapid industry consolidation, which the Treasury seems to be encouraging.But for some banks, going cap in hand to the government was not easy.“It’s the hardest decision I’ve made,” said Curtis L. Hage, the chairman and chief executive of HF Financial in Sioux Falls, S.D. His company, which runs Home Federal Bank, has won preliminary approval for $25 million. Now, Mr. Hage must take the proposal to his board next week.'"
"'08-11-14,'0','“The G-7 was basically the leading 20th-century industrial countries,” Zbigniew Brzezinski, a former national security adviser to President Jimmy Carter, said. “But we need something more than a few key players at these meetings. You have to engage other participants.”Some of these other participants — ranging from Argentina to Australia — have been hit hard by the crisis that began in the United States and spread to Europe. Many have suffered a cash squeeze as Western investors have pulled capital out of emerging markets to cover losses at home.For some countries, like South Korea, it is a nasty replay of the Asian financial crisis a decade ago — except that this time, their governments have pursued generally responsible economic policies and open financial markets.What demands these countries make in Washington is one of the big unanswered questions of the meeting.The decision to broaden the invitation list was made by Mr. Bush — in recognition, his advisers said, that the financial crisis had become a global affliction that demanded global responses.Still, with the United States the epicenter and, to many of the attendees, the cause of the crisis, the shift in the power balance has been accentuated all the more.President-elect Barack Obama will be conspicuous in his absence. He is dispatching some emissaries to meet with foreign leaders, but taking no position on proposed new regulations for the international financial markets.The Bush administration is playing down the prospects for major results from the meeting, partly because it opposes efforts by some Europeans to create a latticework of new regulations and partly because it does not want to commit Mr. Obama to measures that he may not support. Mr. Bush, some observers predicted, could end up a bystander at his own gathering.Given the divergent agendas of the other participants — and the ambitions of some of its leaders, notably Mr. Sarkozy, to stride across the global stage — this has raised some intriguing possibilities.“Are the Europeans or the Chinese going to take advantage of this interregnum in the U.S. to set the tone for the future of financial regulation?” said Simon Johnson, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and a former chief economist of the I.M.F.The Europeans have a long list of measures they favor to prevent a recurrence of the crisis, including executive pay limits and robust oversight of banks, hedge funds and credit-rating agencies.They also want to coordinate financial regulation among countries, perhaps through colleges of supervisors or a global regulatory council, which could be housed at the I.M.F.“We know it’s an awkward time for the United States, but we feel these issues are too important to wait,” said the British ambassador to the United States, Nigel Sheinwald, in a briefing Wednesday.The Bush administration said it would resist any efforts to create regulatory agencies with cross-border authority, something the French have discussed. It opposes regulating hedge funds, something the Germans are keen to pursue. And it is not enthusiastic about bolstering the resources of the I.M.F., as the British have advocated.For all their calls to action, the Europeans are not united. The French favor tighter global coordination of regulation than do the British. The Germans are skeptical of financial arrangements that could force them to bail out their neighbors.The European Commission has just begun a six-month study on how to harmonize regulations in Europe, which, for now, could limit the options of Mr. Sarkozy, Mr. Brown, and Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany. “I’m a little skeptical that they’ll do more than float some trial balloons on this,” said Charles H. Dallara, managing director of the Institute of International Finance, which represents more than 300 global banks.In briefings, British, French and German diplomats said they hoped to extract real results, which could be turned into an “action plan” and set the agenda for a follow-up meeting in 100 days or so. But China’s position on regulations is a mystery, even to those who follow it closely, and other emerging economies have yet to stake out their positions.As a result, the communiqué issued at the end of the meeting is unlikely to include more than general commitments to sound regulations and closer coordination among countries, officials said.As the ambitions for the meeting have narrowed, the talk of a latter-day Bretton Woods has come to seem fanciful. The participants agree that the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund — products of the original Bretton Woods — should continue to serve as central institutions.Europeans want the I.M.F. to have larger resources for emergency aid. But it is not clear how to do that without giving cash-rich countries like China and the oil exporters a bigger voice in its governance.With so little agreement on regulations, some experts say, the meeting would be best used as an occasion to pledge a coordinated effort to stimulate the flagging global economy. Here again, China has taken the lead — announcing a $586 billion stimulus package last weekend.“It certainly puts Hu Jintao into an extremely strong position, coming into the meeting,” said Nicholas R. Lardy, an expert on the Chinese economy at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, referring to China’s president, who is traveling with a 100-person delegation.Germany just announced a modest stimulus plan and Britain plans one next week, leaving Mr. Bush, who opposes further economic stimulus, as the odd man out. Then again, Mr. Obama favors such a package, and the Democratic Congress has promised to take it up in a special session next week, or in January after Mr. Obama takes office.“It feels like we’re waiting for the new king to arrive,” Mr. Johnson of M.I.T. said. “It could be a moment of resurgent American power, especially if nothing gets done this weekend.”'"
"'08-11-14,'0','Christian Slater played an ordinary middle-class father who is also a secret agent, complete with suitable G.M. cars for each personality, a Traverse sport utility vehicle and a Camaro convertible.But as smart as “brand integrations” may be, they are only as effective as the show itself. Viewers rejected “My Own Worst Enemy” quickly; the most recent episode drew only 4.3 million viewers and put NBC in fourth place for the hour.The network will show the remaining five episodes, in part to satisfy its partnership with G.M.Neither partner expressed regrets; Kelly Cusinato, a spokeswoman for G.M., said in a statement that the company was “excited to be a part of the series.”“We continue to look for great opportunities, ideas and partnerships within the larger entertainment business,” Ms. Cusinato said.Well before G.M. looked to receive government financial support, the company started cutting back its television ad spending. In the first half of the year, its spending declined 13 percent compared with the same time last year, according to Nielsen.Weakness in the automotive sector trickles down to advertising-supported companies; automakers represent the largest advertising category for TV networks. While G.M. declined to comment on its advertising budget, the company has withdrawn from its regular advertising slots in the Super Bowl and the Academy Awards.By all accounts, brand integrations are a compelling alternative to 30-second commercial spots; Variety reported last month that the automakers “have been among the biggest spenders” for the format. Infiniti is sponsoring branded segments on “Inside the Actors Studio,” which had its season premiere on Bravo last week. Hyundai is featuring its new Genesis sedan in “24: Redemption,” a two-hour movie to be shown on Fox on Nov. 23.“Advertisers must get their messages across within content, where it’s done organically, seamlessly, and doesn’t interfere with the cognitive rejection factor” of traditional commercials, said Frank Zazza, the chief executive of iTVX, a firm that measures exposure to branded entertainment.Although the details of the partnership between NBC and G.M. were not disclosed, integration deals can be set up on a sliding scale, adjusting the payments and the number of the product placements depending on the performance of the series. Sometimes networks will create custom sponsorships or other content to make up for poor ratings or cancellations.G.M.’s deal with NBC began at the network’s “infront” for advertisers last April. Held one month before the normal upfront presentations, the meetings were meant to jump-start conversations with marketers and make product integrations more likely to succeed. The integrations themselves have had a noticeable impact, even if some of the shows have not.“Every single first-year show we’ve launched has an advertising partner in place, which has probably never happened in broadcast TV,” Ben Silverman, the other co-chairman of NBC Entertainment, said at the New York Television Festival in September.Mr. Silverman is the loudest supporter of brand integrations in network television today. Since joining NBC in the summer of 2007, he has pushed the network to include advertisers in every step of the production process and has spoken about doing more for advertising clients.To promote the Dodge Ram, Mr. Silverman moved the debut of a competition show, “America’s Toughest Jobs,” to summer 2008 from 2009. “They had a vehicle they wanted to launch, and we worked with them,” he said.The automaker deals did not end there: NBC continues to back “Knight Rider,” starring a Ford Mustang in the role of the talking car KITT, despite the show’s relatively low ratings on Wednesday nights. Mr. Graboff said advertiser partnerships were weighed when decisions were made about canceling or renewing shows, but “it’s not the determining factor.”The network may break new marketing ground with “Kings,” a drama recreating a David vs. Goliath-style battle that is scheduled for a winter debut. The series’s principal sponsor, Liberty Mutual, is not inserting blatant mentions of its insurance policies into the scripts; instead, it is connecting the theme of the show to its long-term marketing campaign about responsibility.“It’s not just about sticking a Coke can on a desk anymore,” Mr. Graboff said. “It’s an evolving form.”'"
"'08-11-14,'0','To hear Baby Jane Dexter, a cabaret singer with a mountainous contralto, plow into the early-’90s R.E.M. hit “Everybody Hurts” is to rediscover a rock ballad transformed into an all-purpose anthem in the mode of inspirational war horses like “Bridge Over Troubled Water.” The plain-spoken emotional directness of that ballad makes it something of an anomaly in the catalog of R.E.M., a band known for elliptical lyrics and droning melodies.Ms. Dexter, who made “Everybody Hurts” the encore in her new cabaret show, “If ...,” at the Metropolitan Room on Wednesday evening, had sung it before, but never quite like this. Accompanied by Ross Patterson’s pounding rock piano and Boots Maleson’s bass, she shaped the song into an increasingly urgent cry to “hold on,” as though she were pleading with a desperate friend not to jump off the roof.“Everybody Hurts” was the high point of a show many of whose songs revolve around suppositions, memories and fantasies: “If I Had a Million,” “If I Ruled the World,” “This Nearly Was Mine.” The theme was spelled out with her performance of the Bonnie Bramlett song “What If?” — whose lyrics declare, “I don’t want to spend every day of the life I live asking ‘What if?’ ”Ms. Dexter has always specialized in choosing worthy out-of-the-way songs. In addition to “What If?” the stronger numbers on Wednesday’s opening-night show included Lucinda Williams’s “Side of the Road” and Harry Nilsson’s “Remember.” Rodgers and Hammerstein’s “Ordinary Couple” from “The Sound of Music” was joined to “This Nearly Was Mine,” to suggest picture-perfect domesticity longingly observed from the outside.The bluntest of singers, Ms. Dexter delivers lyrics in big, hearty bursts of energy. She gets into trouble only when she tries to apply musical frills. When she sings too high or too softly, her voice begins to wobble and crack. But when belting in the expansive chest voice that dominated Wednesday’s show, she exerted a formidable command.Augmenting the songs were anecdotes, one of which recalled her experiences in “Hair,” for which she auditioned 13 times, finally making it into the chorus. Returning after a month’s break during which she traveled to Spain, she was shocked to discover she was barely remembered. In “Hi-Diddle-Dee-Dee,” an outlandish fantasy of the actor’s glamorous life from Walt Disney’s “Pinocchio,” she found the perfect offbeat number to complement this tale of punctured show-business expectations.'"
"'08-11-14,'0','When gasoline topped $4 a gallon this summer, Celeste Vazquez of Cleveland started working 10 hours of overtime every week to make ends meet. But lately, with prices falling below $2 a gallon at many stations here, she has been able to cut her hours.“I finally get to spend time with my kids, which is wonderful,” said Ms. Vazquez, 34, as she paid $1.93 a gallon to fill her Chrysler PT Cruiser. “I doubt it will last, though. I’m not about to go buy a new wardrobe or anything.”Lower gas prices meant that Art and Lisa Ritchie, who are farmers, could afford to spend $12 on breakfast last week at the Lighthouse Cafe in Lodi, Ohio. But they have no plans to spend tens of thousands of dollars to furnish and landscape their new house.“I’d love to do those big projects,” said Mr. Ritchie, 49, who farms 16 acres of cherries, peaches, nectarines and figs in northwest Ohio. “But I just know that gas prices will go right back up.”Lower gasoline prices have followed a rapid drop in the price of oil, to less than $59 a barrel on Thursday, from more than $145 a barrel in July. The pace of the recent drop in fuel prices is “absolutely unprecedented,” said Tom Kloza, publisher and chief analyst for the Oil Price Information Service.“People are just excited about it,” said Dennelle Fisher, director at the Maverik store in Wheatland, Wyo., which was selling gas for $1.45 a gallon on Thursday, and even giving a 2-cent break on that price to people with the store’s loyalty cards. “They come in and they ask how long are we going to keep it down,” Ms. Fisher said.Many experts say they believe that gasoline prices are close to bottoming out and that the national average will hover around $2 a gallon through the holidays before creeping up in the new year.In the terrible economic climate, the gas price cut was not enough to bolster consumer spending in October, according to MasterCard SpendingPulse, a report based on MasterCard purchases and estimates of cash, check and other credit card sales.“It would be very surprising if things recovered based solely on gasoline prices,” said Michael McNamara, vice president of research and analysis of MasterCard Advisors, which produces SpendingPulse.Dan Stone certainly has not started spending again. Mr. Stone, of Cleveland, stopped driving his 1996 Dodge Ram pickup on vacations to Arizona and Florida when gas prices rose this year. He also quit buying tickets to Cleveland Indians and Cavaliers games. Now that prices have dropped, the only change he has made is to resume driving his 12-year-old daughter to basketball practice himself instead of arranging car pools.“I still eat all my meals at home,” said Mr. Stone, 59, as he filled his pickup’s tank recently. “And I haven’t started going back to sports games because I’m pretty sure the gas prices will go right back up.”Sitting around the communal table at the Lighthouse Cafe in Lodi, three couples enjoyed breakfast last week before leaving for a group camping trip in the Hocking Hills of Ohio, 150 miles away. One of the campers, Bob Leonard, replaced his Chevrolet S-10 pickup four months ago with a Toyota Prius. His brother, Bill Leonard, 65, swapped his Ford Ranger pickup for a compact Toyota Yaris last year.“I don’t see gas prices staying this low,” said Bob Leonard, 63, a nutrition adviser from Medina, Ohio. “I’m glad I bought the Prius when I did.”Their friend Bob Keller, 62, had parked his Toyota Highlander S.U.V. and started riding the bus to work in downtown Cleveland. With lower gas prices, riding the bus costs as much as he would spend on gas and parking, but he has not considered switching back.“I get to nap on the bus,” said Mr. Keller, who works for Cuyahoga County Employment and Family Services. “Besides, why start driving again when the gas prices will only go right back up?”Across the country, high prices seem to have produced lasting changes in public habits. As prices rose, many people parked their cars and took the bus or train, and that change is evidently sticking even as gas falls. At 22 transit systems surveyed last week by the American Public Transportation Association, ridership either stayed the same or increased over the last two months, said Virginia Miller, spokeswoman for the group.Likewise, MasterCard Advisors reports show that national gasoline demand remains down compared to previous years — though by only 3 to 4 percent a week, compared with the 8 or 9 percent drops of earlier this year.When prices topped $4 a gallon over the summer, Jim Booth of Cleveland could not afford gas for his 1992 Dodge Caravan to visit his 2-year-old son, who lived just eight miles away.Last month, those visits started again. “So that’s wonderful,” said Mr. Booth, 51. “But it’s not like I can afford to buy a new car or anything.”Not everyone is cutting back. Alexander Kudryk paid $2,000 last week for a 1988 Cadillac Brougham with flashy 22-inch rims so he could cruise the streets of Cleveland in style.“I love it,” said Mr. Kudryk, 20. “But if gas prices go back up, I’ll have to sell it.”'"
"'08-11-14,'0','Instead, the first round of bailees are back for second helpings.Before it collapsed, the American International Group was a haughty company that thought it was better than anyone else. It still feels that way.Instead of sounding chastened as its second bailout was announced this week, the company was bragging about how wonderful its insurance operations are, and denying this was really a bailout at all.At a minimum, can’t the government announce and enforce a rule that companies that receive more than $100 billion in bailout money must at least admit their brilliance is open to question?The automakers are next in line. Before the checks are written, the government should confront the question of how this industry can be revived, and force changes to do that.But it is doubtful that a Democratic Congress will have any appetite for huge layoffs and plant closings, and certainly not for reductions in retiree health benefits. There will be talk of better fuel economy and hybrids, but little in the way of pain for anyone except future taxpayers who will owe the money being thrown around now.There may be some stringent financial provisions, intended to force the firms to become commercially viable within a few years, but don’t pay too much attention to them. The early recipients didn’t.It was less than two months ago that the government put up $85 billion for A.I.G. The interest rate was high, and the term of the loan was just two years. The company, under a new chief executive, would have to shape up or close down within 24 months.That new chief executive, Edward Liddy, now says he saw his first priority as being to negotiate more lenient terms. While he was at it, he asked for more money and for a mechanism to get Uncle Sam to take on the risk of some of his company’s worst assets while letting A.I.G. share in the profits if those assets should prove to be valuable. He got it all.Then he told the world that this was not really a bailout at all. “The terms of the restructuring are commercial in nature,” he said on a conference call. “All of the facilities being provided by the U.S. government are at market rates.”Market rates? The government is getting the London interbank offered rate, plus 1 percentage point, while it takes large risks that the bad assets it is taking from A.I.G. will keep losing value. If they do, A.I.G. is under no obligation to repay that loan.A.I.G. would like us to believe that it is a collection of wonderfully run insurance companies, whose parent company made a mistake or two. That is not exactly accurate. Consider one part of the latest bailout. A.I.G.’s insurance companies — the ones that Mr. Liddy says “remain disciplined” — lent out securities like corporate bonds to other investors, as do most institutional investors. Also, as is common, the A.I.G. companies received cash temporarily to assure that the securities were returned.The normal procedure is for the company doing the lending to put the money into supersafe overnight investments, since the securities may be returned, and the cash paid back, at any time. That produces a small but certain profit.A.I.G. had a different idea. Instead of putting the cash into safe investments, it bought mortgage-backed securities, which promised a much better yield. Now those securities have lost a lot of value, and are difficult to sell. A.I.G. needs to have the government provide the cash.That practice was roughly akin to taking the rent money to the racetrack. At least people who do that seem embarrassed when they ask for handouts.Now the government will step in to buy those funny pieces of paper. It will put up 96 percent of the cash, but collect only 83 percent of the profits if the securities go up. And the price the government pays will be based on what A.I.G. says they are worth, although the government is looking for a consultant to check those prices.Another government bailout that is running into problems only weeks after it was announced is the one for Fannie Mae, the government-sponsored mortgage finance company.At Fannie, the government was not so shy about issuing orders. It told Fannie to borrow less, buy more mortgages, and cut the fees it charges to those who sell mortgages to it, all at a time when losses from existing mortgages were growing. This is akin to a family reacting to a financial crisis by saying it will save more money while increasing spending as income declines. It doesn’t work.The problem is conflicting government desires. It wants the costs of mortgages to fall, and wants plenty of them to be available. It also wants Fannie to stop growing.This week Fannie said it may need a new bailout. Are you surprised?All this reflects the conflicting needs and responsibilities of a government that deems companies to be too important to fail. It wants to keep them going, but also wants them to act in ways that seem good for society, whether that consists of cutting mortgage rates or building fuel-efficient cars. And it does not want to increase economic distress at a time when millions are losing their jobs.So the tough choices that would normally have to be made by a company in trouble can be postponed, thereby prolonging the pain.In the meantime, other firms have to compete with wards of the state, on terms that can appear unfair. Competitors say A.I.G. is holding on to customers by cutting premium rates to unreasonable levels. A.I.G. concedes premiums are down, but denies it is leading the cuts. There is a risk that bailed-out carmakers will try to save jobs by cutting car prices to levels even lower than the ones that left them broke.Bailing out companies turns out to be a lot like making loans. Getting someone to take the money is easy; getting them to pay it back is not.'"
"'08-11-14,'0','“Clearly we are in the middle of a situation that is quite dark,” she said in an interview during the brief gap between preparatory gatherings in Brazil and Mexico earlier this week and her departure for Washington on Friday. Without some effort to coordinate action, she said, “it would be the blind leading the blind.”In playing down expectations, Ms. Lagarde’s toughest challenges lie close to home. When the Group of 7 finance ministers were invited to the White House for a working breakfast this fall, she warned Mr. Bush not to raise hopes too much.Did she give her own president the same advice? Ms. Lagarde blushed, then laughed and grabbed for her cup of green tea. While she flashed a grin, she didn’t answer, uncharacteristic for Ms. Lagarde, who is rarely at a loss for words.And her candor is often refreshing. For example, when she talked about persuading banks to lend again after committing billions of euros to bolster their balance sheets, she said: “They can protect their bottom lines but not their bottoms.”With much of official Washington in a state of waiting between the outgoing Bush administration and the inauguration of Barack Obama, demands for far-reaching and speedy changes in the global financial system are mostly coming from the European side of the Atlantic.Prime Minister Gordon Brown of Britain, who along with Mr. Sarkozy has taken the European lead in tackling the current financial crisis, called the Washington talks a “decisive moment” and said more oversight of the world’s 30 largest cross-border financial groups could be achieved “very quickly.”European policy makers are hoping to extend financial regulation to more players, from ratings agencies to hedge funds. They also want to introduce more transparency into the so-called shadow banking system that has grown up outside the regulatory system, so that balance-sheet black holes at large banks are spotted sooner rather than later.And they want to give the International Monetary Fund more money and more power as a global financial watchdog, even if might lead to diminishing the influence of Europe and the United States within the I.M.F. to make room for China, India and other big developing nations.Once a member of France’s national synchronized swimming team, Ms. Lagarde is especially eager for a choreographed response to the financial turmoil that has wracked the world for more than a year and now looks set to push the global economy into recession.“We believe no product, no players and no territories should be left without supervision and regulation,” she said, emphasizing that a new system needs to be created that “will ring the bell when a threat to the system emerges.”For all their contrast in temperament, Mr. Sarkozy and Ms. Lagarde, whom he named as finance minister 17 months ago, make a good team. They are both lawyers and neither attended the École Nationale d’Administration, the traditional breeding ground of France’s ruling elite.The two are born outsiders who had to fight their way to the top, Mr. Sarkozy as the son of an immigrant, and Ms. Lagarde as a woman entering the old boys’ club of both corporate law and French politics. Neither drinks alcohol.But unlike Mr. Sarkozy, Ms. Lagarde spent most of her career in the private sector, lived in the United States for six years and speaks flawless English.She was a regular at the annual World Economic Forum meetings in Davos long before she joined the center-right government in 2005 as trade minister. And she was nicknamed “the American” long before Mr. Sarkozy was.At times one senses that Ms. Lagarde’s more market-oriented instincts are at odds with those of a president who savors the traditional French nationalist posture.One of her biggest concerns, she said, was the rise of protectionism as economic hardship prompted countries to turn inward. “It’s a real threat,” she said.But ask her about Mr. Sarkozy’s proposal to establish a French “sovereign wealth fund” to protect companies in France from “foreign predators,” and she seems uncomfortable.Governments have been protecting industry in other countries, she said, adding: “It’s been going on everywhere.”Her biggest fans are business leaders and foreign finance officials who have seen her in action.“She is a good ambassador for France,” said Pascal Lamy, director general of the World Trade Organization, who has known Ms. Lagarde for 15 years. “She has lived extensively outside of France and has been a major player in the private sector. These things give her a perspective that few French leaders possess.”Lakshmi Mittal, the Indian-born steel magnate, who had found himself under particularly vicious attack in France when merging his Mittal steel business with Europe’s Arcelor, said Ms. Lagarde was a refreshing change from past finance ministers.“She has been able to break the mold here,” said Mr. Mittal, who first met Ms. Lagarde when she was serving as the first female chairman of the international law firm Baker & McKenzie. “I can clearly see a very different approach to the language of the previous finance ministers.”Some of Ms. Lagarde’s male colleagues also say it doesn’t hurt that a woman with diplomatic skills has been running some tricky European Union meetings during the last few months of the French presidency.“There is no grandstanding; you can tell that she has held meetings in the private sector,” said one official, who regularly accompanies one of Ms. Lagarde’s European counterparts to European Union talks.Still, as her international profile has grown, her reputation at home has come under sporadic fire.Over the last year, Ms. Lagarde has been the object of a whispering campaign both inside her own ministry and in the Élysée Palace, with officials anonymously spreading rumors that she was about to lose her job. The French media have been enthusiastically reporting her every slip of the tongue.“The French are always a bit suspicious of a minister who speaks a foreign language fluently,” Mr. Lamy, who is also French, said. “This is especially true if that language is English.”But in recent weeks the pressure has eased. Her visible work in handling the financial crisis has put her in a better light here, along with her many good connections in Washington, especially now that the internationally popular President-elect Obama prepares to move into the White House.Ms. Lagarde prefers to make light of any attacks on her, reciting one of her favorite quotes, from Eleanor Roosevelt.“A woman is like a tea bag: You never know how strong she is until she gets in hot water.”'"
"'08-11-14,'0','As the outlook for an auto industry dimmed, President Bush traveled to Wall Street, where he gave a robust defense of capitalism and seemed to warn world leaders — and the incoming Obama administration — not to draw the wrong lessons from the global economic crisis by over-regulating markets and hindering free trade.The White House, in resisting calls for aiding the automakers, has also warned repeatedly against throwing taxpayer money at companies that may not be salvageable.Acknowledging the Bush administration’s opposition, Mr. Dodd said Democrats had to keep in mind that the Treasury Department already has some authority to help the finance arms of the auto companies but has been reluctant to use it.“I want to be careful about bringing up a proposition that might fail in light of the fact the authority exists, and under an Obama administration there seems to be a greater willingness to deal with the issue,” Mr. Dodd said. “So there are some political considerations to be made.”Passing any legislation to aid the auto companies would require 60 votes in the Senate. Democrats now control 51 of those votes, but Mr. Obama has said he will resign his Senate seat on Sunday, and Vice President-elect is not expected to attend the lame duck session, meaning Democrats would need the support of at least 11 Republicans.With Mr. Bush still wielding his veto authority, the fate of any legislation without White House support would be uncertain.The auto companies, however, remained hopeful and said they would send top executives to Congressional hearings next week to make their case.“We hope all parties recognize there’s a pressing need to preserve the domestic auto industry and the jobs and nation’s competitiveness that’s tied to the industry,” said Greg Martin, a spokesman for . “We’re ready and willing to work with all members of Congress to get this assistance.”The majority leader, Senator of , and House Speaker have urged the Bush administration to help the automakers and said they were prepared to try to push through legislation if the White House refused to act.Mr. Reid, on Thursday, said that he would open a lame-duck session in the Senate on Monday, hoping to move forward with legislation that would extend unemployment benefits and to attach an amendment providing aid for the auto companies.Aides to Ms. Pelosi said the House would be brought back into session as of 1 p.m. Wednesday and would remain on standby, awaiting action by the Senate.Representative , Democrat of and chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, is working on a measure that would direct $25 billion to the carmakers from the $700 billion financial bailout fund. Aides said Mr. Frank was collaborating with his Democratic colleagues in the Senate.President Bush, however, has not signaled any willingness to tap the bailout fund, which the Treasury has said is money better spent on financial institutions. And some powerful Republican lawmakers have voiced strong opposition to government aid for the automakers.Senator of , the senior Republican on the banking committee, said he would not support legislation to aid the auto companies and seemed prepared to let one or all of them collapse.“The financial straits that the Big Three find themselves in is not the product of our current economic downturn, but instead is the legacy of the uncompetitive structure of its manufacturing and labor force,” Mr. Shelby said in a statement. “The financial situation facing the Big Three is not a national problem but their problem.”On Thursday, Representative of , the Republican leader, also came out strongly against the idea.“Spending billions of additional federal tax dollars with no promises to reform the root causes crippling automakers’ competitiveness around the world is neither fair to taxpayers nor sound fiscal policy,” Mr. Boehner said in a statement.Representative Jeb Hensarling of , chairman of the conservative Republican Study Committee, in an appearance on Fox News, said: “You wonder where bailout-mania will end.”Mr. Hensarling said American automakers should bear responsibility for their failed operations. “They are producing high-cost products that consumers don’t want to buy. And so now we have Washington on the verge of giving them a bailout simply because we have all heard of them and they have high-priced lobbyists.”The Senate Republican leader, of , has expressed support for expediting $25 billion in loans for the auto companies that Congress approved in September. But he has not indicated any willingness to provide additional money or to use money from the financial bailout fund for the car makers.“Earlier this year, Congress acted in a bipartisan way to help the auto industry and protect jobs,” said Don Stewart, a spokesman for Mr. McConnell. “The Congress passed and the president signed legislation authorizing $25 billion in low-interest loans to help American automakers retool their facilities to make the fuel-efficient cars of the future. It may be that there are changes that need to be made in order to expedite these low-interest loans.”Mr. Stewart added: “Other ideas have been floated, and all will receive a review as we approach the Senate’s return next week.”Ms. Pelosi so far has rejected the idea of easing restrictions on those loans, which require carmakers to develop technologies that will improve . But Mr. McConnell’s suggestion, also encouraged by the White House, may be the only potential compromise and one Republicans could support because it does not require a new appropriation of federal funds.Some Republicans also suggested that there was less support among rank-and-file Democrats for an auto bailout than party leaders were letting on.One Republican, Senator George V. Voinovich of Ohio, whose state relies heavily on the auto industry, voiced strong support on Thursday for using bailout money to help the failing car companies. Mr. Voinovich was working with Senators and , Democrats of , to drum up support for such a plan.Mr. Levin met Thursday afternoon with Mr. Reid in the majority leader’s office to map out their strategy.Complicating the effort to aid the carmakers is the ownership structure of , a limited partnership controlled by Cerberus Capital Management, a private equity firm. The firm said it would give up any profits from a future sale of the company in exchange for financial assistance from the government, hoping to limit political opposition in Washington to aid for a privately held company, according to Bloomberg News.The shaky support for an auto industry bailout in general had left Ms. Pelosi uncertain about whether calling the House back into session would be worth the trouble.Jim Manley, a senior adviser to Mr. Reid, said there was no chance of approving help for the auto companies without broad support from across the aisle. “We cannot do it without the support of Senate Republicans, who I hope will join us to pass a bill that saves the jobs and protects the livelihoods of millions of hard-working Americans,” Mr. Manley said.'"
"'08-11-14,'0','The president made few references to the stream of bad news that has battered his administration: rising unemployment, increasing home foreclosures and sinking consumer confidence. Rather, the speech, coming from a leader who is overseeing a huge government intervention in the financial markets, was an attempt to put him front and center in advance of the summit meeting, and to frame the debate on his terms.When leaders of foreign powers arrive in the capital Friday for the emergency meeting of 19 nations and the European Union, the president will have to contend with other heads of government who have their own agendas, and who will remain on the international stage after he is gone. Mr. Bush may also find himself in the shadow of President-elect Barack Obama, who is not even at the session.“He’s going to be much more the host and much less the chairman than he realizes,” Adam S. Posen, who advises foreign governments on economic coordination, said of Mr. Bush. “He’s going to be providing the snacks and the venue and making sure everybody’s comfortable, but he is not going to be driving the agenda; that’s the reality. The agenda-setting is with Gordon Brown and Nicolas Sarkozy and Hu Jintao.”While Mr. Obama has declined to attend the meeting, he is dispatching two high-powered emissaries — Madeleine K. Albright, who was Bill Clinton’s secretary of state, and Jim Leach, a Republican former congressman from Iowa — to conduct unofficial meetings on the sidelines of the summit talk with any foreign officials who might want them.For Mr. Bush it is another reminder that his days as “the decider” are soon to be over — and a signal that for all the fanfare surrounding the international meeting, it may wind up being more symbolism than substance. With just two months left in office, Mr. Bush can hardly negotiate on behalf of the United States when neither he nor his foreign counterparts know if Mr. Obama will live up to the commitments he makes.“I don’t think there’s any question that a lame duck president conducting an international summit of this kind is a risky endeavor,” said Leon E. Panetta, a former chief of staff to Mr. Clinton who has advised Mr. Obama’s transition team. “They can’t cut a deal anymore — all they can really do is lay out some principles — so let’s face it. In the end, this isn’t really George Bush’s game anymore. It’s Barack Obama’s.”Then again, financial crises do not run in tandem with American political cycles; the White House says that the meeting, envisioned as the first in a series that will continue once Mr. Obama is in office, is necessary and appropriate, and that the situation is too urgent to wait.The goal, Bush advisers say, is to forge an international consensus on the root causes of the crisis and lay the foundation for regulatory changes to prevent a similar crisis in the future.But any discussion of root causes could easily turn into finger-pointing at Mr. Bush and his administration; the Russian president, Dmitri A. Medvedev, has been quite outspoken in saying the United States is to blame. And as Mr. Bush’s speech in New York demonstrated, the president is trying hard to push back against the idea, advanced by Mr. Sarkozy and others, that a much stronger international regulatory regime is necessary.“We must recognize that government intervention is not a cure-all,” Mr. Bush said, adding, “History has shown that the greater threat to economic prosperity is not too little government involvement in the market, but too much.”In defending the American model of capitalism, Mr. Bush pointed out that some European countries, which claimed to have more rigorous regulation than the United States, had “problems almost identical to our own,” and in some cases, suffered far worse repercussions because their banks were even more overstretched.The White House also appears to be trying to use the Group of 20 conference to resist Mr. Obama’s proposal for aid to American automakers, and to prod Mr. Obama and other Congressional Democrats into approving a long-stalled free trade pact with Colombia.Dan Price, an international economics adviser to Mr. Bush who is the so-called sherpa, or liaison to foreign governments, for the meeting, said this week that Mr. Bush would use the gathering as “an opportunity to urge his fellow leaders not to turn inward or stifle markets.” He added pointedly, “Protectionist rhetoric about walling off markets or companies does not help stabilize markets, but in fact leads to greater uncertainty.”The summit meeting, which will open Friday night with a dinner in the State Dining Room of the White House and continue on Saturday with a working session at the National Building Museum here, was Mr. Sarkozy’s idea. But from the start, Mr. Bush sought to take control.Mr. Sarkozy suggested convening the session in New York; the White House insisted on Washington, giving Mr. Bush the home advantage. Mr. Sarkozy wanted the participants limited to the so-called Group of 8 economic powers. Mr. Bush insisted on an expanded list, the Group of 20, which includes developing nations like China and India — a smart move, Mr. Posen said.“That’s a real legacy issue,” Mr. Posen said. “He will go down in history books as the first American president to include those kinds of countries on an equal footing in an international economic negotiation.”But many experts say they do not expect much to come of the meeting, in part because it was hastily convened. The session has been called Bretton Woods II, a reference to the 1944 international conference in New Hampshire that remade the global financial system after the Great Depression and toward the end of World War II. But that conference was years in the planning; this one was put together in less than a month.“The problem is not simply that Bush is a lame duck; it’s not simply that he can’t commit his successor,” said Richard N. Haass, president of the Council on Foreign Relations. “It’s also that there is not yet a consensus among the governments about what to do.”'"
"'08-11-14,'0','WASHINGTON — A House of Representatives committee room was transformed into a club for billionaires for a few hours on Thursday, as five of the richest men in the world testified on the role of hedge funds in financial markets.The billionaires were all hedge fund managers themselves, among the most prominent — and successful — in the business. Many of the people crowding the room expected a slugfest, given the growing calls on Capitol Hill for hedge funds, those private investment vehicles, to disclose their investments and business practices. So it came as something of a surprise when the managers agreed, more or less, with the lawmakers. All five managers — Philip A. Falcone, Kenneth C. Griffin, John A. Paulson, James Simons and George Soros — said they would support new rules that would require their industry, controlling nearly $2 trillion, to disclose more of its secrets.The hearing was crammed with some of the same policy makers who have criticized people who presided over the financial boom that has become a painful bust. But aside from some grumblings about how much money hedge fund managers make, the sharpest remarks were directed not at John Paulson and the other hedge fund billionaires, but at Henry M. Paulson Jr., the secretary of the Treasury.“The headline of this hearing is definitely Paulson v. Paulson,” joked Elijah E. Cummings, Democrat of Maryland.For all the theatrics, a consensus seemed to be emerging. More than a year into the financial crisis, the hedge fund industry’s leaders seem to realize that regulation may be inevitable, that operating under the radar may no longer be possible, and that their riches have torn away their cloak of anonymity.Mr. Griffin, the founder of the Citadel Investment Group, displayed the most resistance to the changing tide, at first saying that greater regulation of the industry was not needed. Then, growing flush, Mr. Griffin, who began trading bonds out of his Harvard dorm room, said he would “not be averse” to greater disclosure, so long as the information was shared only with regulators.'"
"'08-11-14,'0','Two government reports released Thursday showed continuing signs of weakness in the economy.A decline in crude oil prices helped to narrow the United States trade deficit in September, but both imports and exports fell sharply.Separately, a report from the Labor Department showed that first-time claims for jobless benefits in the week that ended Nov. 8 increased to 516,000, an increase of 32,000 from the previous week. The Labor Department also reported that the number of Americans collecting jobless benefits jumped to 3.9 million in the week that ended Nov. 1, hitting a 25-year high.Announcements of job cuts at companies including Citigroup, the Goldman Sachs Group, Ford Motor and Circuit City Stores will probably add to unemployment claims in the weeks ahead.The Commerce Department reported Thursday that the trade deficit shrank by $2.6 billion, or 4.4 percent, to $56.5 billion in September, from $59.1 billion a month earlier. Much of that resulted from a 15.7 percent decline in petroleum imports as prices for crude oil declined throughout the month. Crude oil is now trading at less than $60 a barrel.Excluding oil, the deficit widened to $35.5 billion in September, from $33.7 billion in August, as American exports slumped, said James O’Sullivan, United States economist at UBS. American exports fell $9.9 billion from August to September.“It’s reflecting weakening domestic as well as foreign demand,” Mr. O’Sullivan said. “In some sense, they offset each other.”'"
"'08-11-14,'0','Jorgen Elmeskov, an economist with the organization, said that the outlook depended largely on the depth and duration of the financial crisis. “The ongoing adjustment in housing markets still has a long way to go,” he said in a statement.A recession is commonly defined as two consecutive quarters of shrinking G.D.P.News that Germany was in its second recession in six years “shatters earlier hopes that Germany might hold up relatively well against the global downturn,” Jennifer McKeown, an economist in London with Capital Economics, wrote in a research note.Figures expected Friday from Britain, Italy and the Netherlands were likely to show declines as well.In Germany, the grim economic news is adding to the pressure on Chancellor Angela Merkel’s coalition government to introduce more ambitious measures to stimulate the economy, to spur growth and consumer spending and to prevent a surge in unemployment.“It is now clear that the original package of measures, which were designed to generate about 50 billion euros in investment and contracts, is inadequate,” said Timo Klein, a senior economist at Global Insight in Frankfurt. “The government must react, and soon, to these latest figures by the statistics office.”The contraction was caused by the negative impact the global financial crisis was having on German exports, which had been the engine of the country’s growth.Although precise figures will not be made available until later this month, the statistics office said the decline of the euro against the dollar was not enough to offset the sharp fall in consumer spending and downturns in the United States and other major markets that import German goods.At the same time, there was a surge in imports, and “the balance of exports and imports had a negative impact on the development of the gross domestic product,” the statistics office said.Companies, notably manufacturers, were also reducing their investments in response to falling demand. “In the manufacturing sector alone, investment has declined between 7 percent and 8 percent,” Mr. Klein said.'"
"'08-11-14,'0','BERLIN, Nov 13 (Reuters) — German gross domestic product contracted by 0.5 percent in the third quarter, putting Europe's largest economy in recession for the first time in five years, Federal Statistics Office figures showed on Thursday.The bigger than expected quarter-on-quarter drop in growth, adjusted for seasonal, calendar and price effects, was marked by a negative contribution from foreign trade as exports weakened. This more than offset a rise in private and public consumption.The office also revised up the second-quarter GDP figure to show a contraction of 0.4 percent, compared with 0.5 percent previously reported. The last time the economy shrank for two straight quarters was in the first half of 2003, it said.""If you think today's numbers are already bad, just wait for the next quarter,"" said ING Financial Markets' Carsten Brzeski. ""The headwinds of the financial crisis and the global economic slowdown are blowing right in the face of the German economy.""""So far, there is only dim light at the end of the tunnel. At the earliest, a recovery can be expected in the second half of 2009.""'"
"'08-11-14,'0','“We pulled back to some previous lows that were pretty monumental,” said Jocelynn Drake, an equities analyst at Schaeffer’s Investment Research. “A lot of people saw this as an opportunity.”The energy sector posted some of the biggest gains of the day after the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries said its members would meet Nov. 29 to discuss cutting production.Crude oil prices and energy stocks, which have tumbled in recent weeks on fears of falling demand, rebounded on Thursday. Crude settled at $58.24 a barrel. Shares of Exxon Mobil were up 9.4 percent, to $75.41, and Chevron gained 12.5 percent, to close at $75.71.All major financial sectors were up Thursday, and all but two of the 30 companies in the Dow finished higher. General Motors closed down by 4.2 percent, at $2.95, and Citigroup lost 2 percent, to close at $9.45.For many companies, the rally transformed a rough day into a banner one. Shares of Intel dropped after the company cut its sales outlook, but they were swept up in the buying and finished up 6.7 percent, at $14.43. Other technology stocks like Microsoft, Google, Sun Microsystems and Apple also finished higher.Wal-Mart Stores, the world’s largest retailer, rebounded from negative territory to close up 4.4 percent. The company reported a 10 percent increase in third-quarter profit on Thursday but reduced its profit outlook.Even shares in retailers like Kohl’s, Macy’s, Gap and American Eagle, which are facing a bleak holiday shopping season, ended higher.The rally on Thursday surprised many analysts because it came on another day of glum economic data that presage a broad and lasting downturn. The government reported that initial jobless claims rose to a seasonally adjusted 516,000 last week, and said that imports and exports fell sharply in September as the trade deficit narrowed.The disconnect between higher unemployment, lower consumer spending and a 550-point rally of the Dow underscores the instability in the markets, and some analysts said they doubted the gains would hold.“The volatility is definitely not out of the market,” Ms. Drake said. “I’m very reluctant to say, ‘Oh wait, the bottom’s been reached.’ To me this is more of a flash in the pan.”But James B. Stack, president of InvesTech Research, said the market was trying to find its bottom, and said he was encouraged by the rebound.“It was a classic retest of the lows that was successful,” he said.Markets in Asia had some of their steepest declines this month on Thursday amid fresh worries about the state of the American and Chinese economies and poor corporate news out of the United States. But Friday morning, however, many rebounded.The Nikkei 225 in Japan was up 4.26 percent in Friday morning trading, and the Hang Seng in Hong Kong gained 3.34 percent.In Europe, several major indices were mixed in trading on Thursday. The DAX in Frankfurt finished up 0.6 percent; in London, the FTSE 100 ended down 0.3 percent. The CAC 40 in Paris gained 1.1 percent.Interest rates were higher. The Treasury’s 10-year bill fell 1 percentage point, to 99 5/32. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, was at 3.85 percent, up from 3.65 percent late Wednesday.Following are the results of the Treasury auction on Thursday of 182-day cash management bills and 30-year bonds:'"

The Lady Frogs led throughout after LaFleur made the opening shot.This was not the kind of start the Terrapins wanted after last season when they were 33-4 and reached the quarterfinals of the N.C.A.A. tournament for the second time in three years.“Obviously, we didn’t come out with that same sense of urgency that they did, and they really capitalized on it,” Maryland’s Kristi Toliver said.'"
"'08-11-15,'0','She finds herself in the national spotlight more than ever. She is loudly pushing for the auto industry rescue while Michigan’s Congressional delegation works votes on Capitol Hill. President-elect Barack Obama has put her on his transition economic advisory board (an appointment her strongest critics here deride as ludicrous, akin to putting a tobacco executive on a health board).Ms. Granholm, who played Sarah Palin in Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s warm-ups for the vice-presidential debate and who is barred by term limits from seeking re-election in 2010, has been mentioned as someone Mr. Obama may appoint to his cabinet. It is a notion Ms. Granholm — long a Bush administration critic for what she describes as inconsistent enforcement of trade pacts and a lack of manufacturing policy — gently dismisses: “I really want to be governor when I have a partner in the White House.”Her critics seem dismayed by the speculation. They blame her and the state’s business regulations and taxes, at least partly, for Michigan’s long list of dismal rankings among the states (No. 2 in unemployment; No. 5 in foreclosure starts; No. 51, including the District of Columbia, in attracting new residents). The governor’s approval ratings dropped to slightly less than 50 percent favorable last month from a high of near 70 percent in 2003.“I fear if she has the president’s ear,” said Michael D. LaFaive, director of fiscal policy at the Mackinac Center for Public Policy, a research group in Midland, Mich., that advocates a free market. “There’s a reason people are fleeing the state, and it has much to do with the bad public policies this state has embraced over the last 6 to 12 years.”But Ms. Granholm’s supporters say she has done all she could, given gloomy times brought on long before she arrived by monumental changes in the nation’s manufacturing, and, most of all, in the auto industry. As Ms. Granholm sees it, the state has responded by revamping just about everything — taxes, education, even the sorts of businesses it is seeking.In her constant courting of companies in the United States and overseas, Ms. Granholm said she had focused on bringing home businesses that work with alternative energy (like wind turbines), domestic security (a field auto suppliers might easily move into), advanced manufacturing (like robotics) and life sciences.The state has recently enacted a tougher, college-preparatory-style curriculum in its high schools. Its “No Worker Left Behind” retraining program depends on what jobs local employers say they actually need to fill. And this year, it began offering incentives to moviemakers in the hopes of building a “creative economy,” a concept, Ms. Granholm says, “we haven’t necessarily had since Motown days.”In all of this, her efforts have brought more than 120,800 new jobs to the state since she took office in 2003, her office says. (Her staff noted those “direct” jobs were estimated to have brought two to three times as many new “indirect” jobs that cropped up around the others, and said state efforts had helped “retain” 233,000 jobs from companies that had hinted of leaving Michigan.)Still, net losses since mid-2000 (and just for manufacturing jobs, since 1999) swamp the picture. Since June 2000, the state’s net job loss was more than 500,000; since Ms. Granholm took office, the net loss was 281,500.“Sometimes leadership is planting trees under whose shade you’ll never sit,” she said. “It may not happen fully till after I’m gone. But I know that the steps we’re taking are the right steps.”Jennifer Mulhern Granholm (she took the last name of her husband, Daniel, as her middle name and he did the same with her last name), 49, was born in Vancouver, British Columbia. She briefly considered an acting career and was once a contestant on “The Dating Game,” and graduated from University of California, Berkeley, and Harvard Law School. Eventually, she moved to Michigan. A former prosecutor, she was elected Michigan’s attorney general in 1998, then became the state’s first woman to be elected governor four years later. She has three children.Even her critics praise Ms. Granholm’s political skills, her engaging speaking style, her ability to make even her most vocal opponents in the Legislature admit that they like her. But they say she started off as a nearly untested policy maker trying to solve an economic problem that would have challenged someone with far more experience.“I think she’s a good politician, but at the same time, she’s not necessarily a great decision maker,” said Saul Anuzis, the state Republican Party chairman.But Mark Schauer, the State Senate’s Democratic leader who was elected this month to Congress, pointed to a “hostile” Legislature — both chambers were controlled by Republicans until 2006 (and the Senate still is) — for a “lack of urgency” despite Ms. Granholm’s “focus and tenacity” on the economy.In 2007, a contentious standoff over how to solve a more than $1.5 billion deficit in the state budget dragged on for months, finally ending in the face of a government shutdown and with tax increases — deeply difficult, Ms. Granholm said, but unavoidable.This year, there were more distractions: For months, a scandal enveloped Kwame M. Kilpatrick, then the mayor of Detroit. Eventually, as Ms. Granholm began proceedings to determine if he should be removed, Mr. Kilpatrick resigned and pleaded guilty to felony charges — but not, she said, before more economic damage had been done, with conventions canceled and businesses not wanting to move to Detroit. “One crisis at a time,” she said in the interview.For now, all eyes here are on whether Congress will provide $25 billion in emergency aid to the automakers, and whether lawmakers will do it soon enough, before some industry experts fear one of the Big Three may collapse. The mere possibility makes Ms. Granholm wince. The likely result, she said, would be catastrophic on residents, so many of whom work in the industry and all its offshoots.“It would be such a huge, huge strain on our safety net,” she said. “It would be of double Katrina-like proportions. We would absolutely need assistance.”But she said she felt confident that the aid would be granted. Still, she said, Michigan is a cautionary tale against putting a state’s entire hopes in a single industry.“Now, we love our auto industry,” she said. “But if we had worked harder on diversifying this economy long ago, then if one of the legs of the stool starts to get wobbly, at least you’ve got three other legs to stand on.”'"
"'08-11-15,'0','Boeing reached a tentative agreement on a new contract with the union representing its white-collar engineers, but was forced to delay the latest cargo version of its 747 jumbo because of design changes and problems with suppliers. The four-year contract agreement, which must now be approved by a majority of the 21,000 members of the Society of Professional Engineering Employees in Aerospace, would avoid a second damaging strike at the plane maker’s Seattle area plants; a 58-day strike by its 27,000-member machinists union ended Nov. 2.Boeing also said it was pushing back the schedule on the cargo version of its 747 jumbo by as much as nine months as it deals with design issues and problems with suppliers, aggravated by the machinists’ strike.

"'08-11-15,'0','Coach Mike D’Antoni assigned Marbury to the bench in the preseason, then took him off the active roster in the second game of the regular season.The divorce has been held up by the Knicks’ refusal to swallow Marbury’s contract and by Marbury’s refusal to accept less in a buyout. He has repeatedly said he would not accept “a penny less” than what he is owed.After spending two weeks in street clothes, watching the Knicks win without him and his market value decline, Marbury relented. But there is still great skepticism that he will accept a significant pay cut to gain his professional freedom.Walsh, who is weary of the issue, declined to comment.“I have nothing to report on Stephon,” he said. “I’m not going to get into that.”Marbury offered little enlightenment, chirping sarcastically, “We reached a buyout!” as he skipped into the locker room before Friday night’s game against the Oklahoma City Thunder.Although he confirmed the meeting, Marbury refused to answer any questions about a potential buyout.Asked directly if he was now open to a buyout, Marbury said, “There’s nothing going on” — a phrase he invoked seven times in a two-and-a-half minute interview.He still sounded reluctant to negotiate, asking a reporter: “If I owed you $100 and I said I want to give you $80, what would you say? What would you say?”Behind closed doors, Marbury has taken a different tack. It is believed that Biagas, at Marbury’s direction and with permission from the Knicks, will gauge the market for Marbury. A buyout figure will be based largely on how much Marbury can earn from another team.That is more complicated than it sounds because of the N.B.A.’s “set-off” rules. When a player is released and signs with another team, his original team is entitled to reduce its payment to the player, based on a set formula. The less Marbury secures from another team, the more difficult buyout negotiations would be.However, the Knicks can waive their set-off rights during negotiations. Because they are over the luxury-tax threshold, every dollar the Knicks pay Marbury costs them twice as much. Thus a buyout that reduces Marbury’s salary by $3 million would save them $6 million.'"
"'08-11-15,'0','President Bush has nominated a federal prosecutor from New York City for an important role in monitoring the administration’s $700 billion financial markets rescue operation.Neil M. Barofsky, an assistant United States attorney in Manhattan, was named Friday to be special inspector general for the Treasury’s Troubled Assets Relief Program, the linchpin of the emergency bailout plan enacted last month by Congress.A prosecutor for the last eight years, Mr. Barofsky runs an eight-member division investigating mortgage fraud, predatory lending and deceptive foreclosure scams. While he has also handled important narcotics cases, he is best known on Wall Street for leading the government’s successful fraud prosecution of two senior executives of Refco, the commodities trading firm that collapsed in 2005.If confirmed by the Senate, Mr. Barofsky will fill one of the three oversight roles built into the complex bailout legislation — a role similar to that of the special inspector general for Iraq reconstruction, Stuart W. Bowen Jr., whose office has been monitoring that federal contracting process since 2004.The bailout law also gave monitoring duties to the federal Office of the Comptroller General, which has already assigned staff members to the new Treasury operation. And the law further required the Congressional leadership to create a five-member board, called the Congressional Oversight Panel, to provide legislative review for the bailout and recommend regulatory reforms.'"
"'08-11-15,'0','Small businesses have been hit hard by the slowing economy, facing declining demand and having a difficult time getting loans. Some have been seeking relief from their advocate in Washington, the Small Business Administration, which this week relaxed some of the lending rules that banks must follow.Santanu K. Baruah, known as Sandy, the agency’s acting administrator since August, sat down recently in his office to talk about changes the agency is making to help small companies weather the economic downturn.Q. What are the changes that the agency adopted to increase capital for small businesses?A. We are encouraging our lending partners to make more loans available for small businesses by not restricting them to using the prime rate when pricing S.B.A.-guaranteed loans. We are now allowing them to also use Libor — the London interbank offered rate — which determines what lenders pay for money. The credit crisis has disrupted the normal relationship between the two rates, which has limited the number of small-business loans our lenders are willing to approve.Q. Have you done anything else to increase liquidity for the small companies?A. We adopted another emergency rule to simplify assembling S.B.A.-guaranteed loans for sale on the secondary market. It allows loans to be packaged using an average interest rate instead of requiring that all loans packaged together for sale on the secondary market have the same interest rate. This will make it easier for such loans to be assembled for sale and should encourage S.B.A. lenders relying on the secondary market for funds to continue to originate loans, which helps increase the availability of capital to small businesses.Q. Lending in your main loan programs has decreased significantly. Why?A. The overall number the S.B.A. approved in October was down roughly 68 percent versus October 2007. The dollar value decrease in the same program, 7(a), was 36 percent less than the same period last year. Economic development loans were down 45 percent in volume and 32 percent in dollars. It’s hard for small businesses to obtain initial credit, and to maintain the credit they have. But it’s also a difficult environment to risk taking a loan and starting a business.'"
"'08-11-15,'0','Such a campaign is relatively easy for Amazon, of course, because it does not need to worry about how products appear as they dangle from pegs on store shelves, or whether items will disappear inside shoppers’ jacket pockets.But even offline companies that do have those concerns are joining the movement. Microsoft recently unveiled an unusual container for the Explorer computer mice it sells at Best Buy. The mouse looks typically imprisoned in its package at first glance. But the container actually has a plastic zipper on each side — inspired by the packaging of food items, Microsoft said — with blue arrows that guide buyers into easily unlocking their purchase.Sony, meanwhile, has started an ambitious internal project it optimistically calls “death of the clamshell.” The electronics giant is developing three packaging prototypes it plans to test in the coming months at Best Buy and Wal-Mart Stores. One uses an adhesive that is easy to pry open but makes a loud Velcro-like noise — intended to deter thieves.Sony has even taken its anticlamshell campaign to its rank and file. At its annual sales and marketing meeting in April, held in Palm Desert, Calif., the company showed 1,200 employees a humorous video of four consumers struggling to open Sony products. One of them resorted to a hacksaw, another used his teeth and a third cut his finger.“None of us intentionally tried to make this a hassle for consumers,” said Mike Fasulo, chief marketing officer for Sony.In fact, companies like Sony resorted to hermetically sealed packaging with the best of intentions. A decade ago, as toys and consumer electronics items grew more complex, retailers decided they needed to attract shoppers by showing off items on shelves in clear plastic, instead of opaque boxes.To do so while protecting the items, they decided to seal the hinges of containers with tough epoxy that would resist shoplifting, or what retailers call “shrinkage.”Most shoppers know what happened next. There are the injuries, of course. And tool makers found a thriving market for blade-bristling implements to defeat the clamshell, with names like the Plastic Surgeon and the Package Shark.For the last few years, Consumer Reports has published an annual Oyster Awards for the clamshell packages that are most frustrating to open. Last year’s winner: an Oral-B sonic toothbrush kit from Procter & Gamble and the Bratz Sisterz dolls from MGA Entertainment, which took an adult tester eight and a half minutes to open.For consumers like Lisa Martin, a mother of two from Chicago, such packaging means exhausting birthday mornings as her young children wonder impatiently why a cluster of adults are stabbing at their new presents with knives and scissors.“I understand antitheft. But when you get home and it takes two days to get your purchase open, it kind of defeats the purpose,” said Ms. Martin, who was so enthusiastic about Amazon’s “frustration-free” initiative she offered in her blog to “make out” with the company.But Ms. Martin and like-minded consumers should not pucker up quite yet. In a sign that there remains a long way to go before the last clamshell is pried open, TracFone Wireless, a mobile phone company, sent an unusual gift this fall to Radio Shack outlets that carry its products.Each store has received a small box-cutter with the TracFone logo that Radio Shack sales staff can use to help open packages for shoppers.“Rather than send coffee cups, we decided to send them something that helps them do their jobs better,” said Derek Hewitt, senior vice president for marketing at TracFone, adding that his company has already made the transition to easier to open packages. “We know how frustrating it is at Christmas to open these packages.”'"
"'08-11-15,'0','NICE, France — President Dmitri A. Medvedev of Russia retreated Friday from his threat to deploy missiles on Europe’s borders, but only if President-elect Barack Obama joined Russia and France in calling for a conference on European security by next summer.At a meeting in Nice hosted by President Nicolas Sarkozy of France, Mr. Medvedev backed away from the bellicose speech he gave last week, just hours after Mr. Obama won the United States presidential election. On Friday, the Russian leader argued instead that all countries “should refrain from unilateral steps” before discussions on European security next summer.Mr. Sarkozy, who presided over the meeting between Russia and the 27 European Union nations in his capacity as the union’s president, helped ease the way for Mr. Medvedev’s retreat. The French leader supported the idea of talks on a new security architecture for Europe and suggested that they could be held by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe in June or July.Both Russia and the United States belong to the organization.Mr. Sarkozy made clear that he wants the United States to think again about the missile defense systems that it plans to build in Poland and the Czech Republic. Mr. Medvedev last week threatened to respond by stationing missiles in Kaliningrad, a Russian enclave bordering Poland and Lithuania, both of which are members of NATO and the European Union.“Between now and then,” said Mr. Sarkozy, referring to the summer summit meeting, “please no more talk of antimissile protection systems.”'"
"'08-11-15,'0','For investors who wondered whether the market had found its bottom, the continuing losses and grim economic numbers suggested that the problems would continue. On Friday, the Federal Reserve chairman Ben S. Bernanke told a bankers conference in Germany that the American economy was under “severe strain,” and the president of the Cleveland Fed said the economy was in a recession.“It has been a weakening environment, and we haven’t found the bottom yet,” said Mark Miller of William Blair and Company.The mortgage finance giant Freddie Mac reported a $25.3 billion loss and requested money from the federal government. Shares in Freddie, which have been consistently below $1 since last week, closed at 67 cents on Friday.Energy stocks and crude oil prices fell on Friday after surging on Thursday on hopes that the OPEC cartel would cut production when it met on Nov. 29. Energy companies including Exxon Mobil, Chevron and Conoco Phillips all finished down, and the price of crude oil fell $1.20, to $57.04 a barrel.Interest rates on Treasury notes fell. The Treasury’s 10-year bill rose 31/32, to 100 4/32. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, was at 3.73 percent, down from 3.85 percent late Thursday.The department store chain, J. C. Penney, said Friday that its total sales dropped 8.7 percent in the third quarter, and that same-store sales — sales at stores open at least a year — fell 10 percent. The department store’s net income fell 52 percent in the quarter.Shares in J. C. Penney fell $2.01, or 10 percent, to $17.27, luxury retailers and discount supercenters took a hit. Shares in Abercrombie & Fitch fell 20 percent after the clothing retailer reported that its revenue had fallen 8 percent, and warned that its same-store sales could drop by as much as one-fourth by the end of the year.Macy’s and Sears were off, and Saks was down more than 21 percent. Wal-Mart, the world’s largest retailer, which has reported steady sales, was down 4 percent.The lower outlook from J. C. Penney came as the Commerce Department reported that retail sales plummeted 2.8 percent in October, a record, and were down 4.1 percent from October 2007. Flagging automobile sales, which are 23 percent below last year’s numbers, led the plunge.Spending at gasoline stations dropped sharply, by nearly 13 percent, as falling oil prices pushed down the price of gasoline.Consumers cut back their spending across nearly every sector, like furniture, electronics and clothing. The data portend a bleak Christmas shopping season that will force retailers to make deep discounts, analysts said.“It’s just brutal,” said Eric Beder, retail analyst at Brean Murray and Company. “It’s a very bleak time for the consumer. Unless it’s something supercompelling or really necessary, they’re not going to the mall, they’re not spending.”Bill Cheney, chief economist at John Hancock Financial, said the falling numbers were a sign that consumers, praised throughout the last decade as an indefatigable driving force of the economy, are now “cowering.”“Consumers feel like the bottom is falling out and that they better pull back,” Mr. Cheney wrote in a note. “Probably less than half of the people working today were working during the early 1980s recession when we faced this level of job losses. It is staggering both economically and psychologically.”'"
"'08-11-15,'0','PARIS — The economy of the euro zone slipped into recession for the first time during the third quarter, the European Union’s statistics agency confirmed Friday, as the financial crisis continued to depress manufacturing activity and consumer demand.Gross domestic product declined 0.2 percent in the third quarter from the previous three months in both the euro zone, which comprises the 15 countries that use the euro as their currency, and the European Union as a whole, according to an initial estimate published by the agency Eurostat.The weakness in the third quarter was particularly marked in Germany and Italy, both of which have technically entered a recession with G.D.P. contractions of 0.5 percent from the previous quarter after a similar decline in the second period.France managed to avoid a technical recession, defined as two consecutive quarters of negative growth, as its economy grew 0.1 percent. Spanish G.D.P. also fell, by 0.2 percent, posting the first quarterly decline since 1993. Dutch G.D.P. was flat, after also stagnating in the second quarter and British growth was down by 0.5 percent after a flat reading during the previous quarter.Compared with the same quarter a year earlier, G.D.P. grew 0.7 percent in the 15-member euro zone and 0.8 percent for the 27 countries of the European Union.

"'08-11-16,'0','FOR the American automobile industry, the years since the glory days of the 1950s and ’60s have been a period of decline. Ever since the oil crises and the Japanese import invasion of the 1970s, the automakers have repeatedly flirted with financial ruin.They stayed afloat, at times quite profitably, by shifting their focus to sport utility vehicles and big pickup trucks, which indulged the desires of consumers for larger and more powerful vehicles. They deluded themselves into thinking they had created a successful strategy, when what they had really created was a protected and precarious perch.Bankruptcy, then, might be well deserved, were it not for the risk of the complete collapse of the companies. The industry must be bailed out by the federal government. There are hundreds of thousands of jobs at stake, and a strong domestic manufacturing sector is important for security reasons.Scarce American dollars, however, must be invested in the larger public interest. The best bailout is one that weans us off oil and sets us on a path to reduced carbon emissions. Congress and President-elect Barack Obama are not qualified to protect shareholders’ interests, nor can they build a better car. But they can ensure that society benefits from our investment in the automobile industry.One way to do that would be to establish a price floor of $3.50 per gallon on gasoline. If the price drops below that, as it recently has, the federal government would impose a variable tax to bring the price up to $3.50. If the price goes above $3.50, then the tax disappears. The money raised by the variable tax would be used, at least in the short term, to provide loan guarantees to the auto companies. (To ease the burden of higher gasoline prices on low-income taxpayers, some of the revenue would be provided to them as tax credits or vouchers.)'"

It’s crazy. I love Levi.”Maria Riesch of Germany finished third and Hosp was fourth.It was Vonn’s first World Cup slalom victory and 14th World Cup victory over all. Her previous best career slalom results also came at Levi, which is north of the Arctic Circle and is the northernmost World Cup site. In consecutive slaloms at Levi in 2006, she was fourth and sixth.'"

"'08-11-16,'0','For instance, at Lazard, where I spent six years when it was a privately held partnership, the partners moved forward into the marketplace like a school of fish. When the partnership as a whole made money, partners (and some non-partners like me) shared in those profits based upon a point system that our patriarch, Michel David-Weill, established at the beginning of every year. When partners messed up — as a few did in the firm’s municipal finance department in the 1990s, forcing the firm to pay $100 million in fines, restitution and legal fees — the burden of the mistake was also shared by all, through a reduction in the pre-tax profits of the firm.The punishment for that misadventure was ruthless: not only did the partners involved get fired but Mr. David-Weill quickly shuttered the whole department. This is because the status of the firm was held very important — so much so that senior partners would often reject a particular assignment solely because of the risk that the firm’s image might suffer from the deal. The formula worked magnificently, if the preponderance of satisfied clients — and the Fifth Avenue and Hamptons addresses among the partners — was indicative of anything.But this quaint system began changing a generation ago when one venerable partnership after another decided to grab the riches available by selling shares to the public. What started with Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette in 1969 became a Wall Street stampede that eventually included Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs and even 157-year-old Lazard, in May 2005.The result has been calamitous. The collective liability clause honored by partners was replaced with a system where bankers and traders were encouraged to take short-term risks with shareholders’ money. Gone, too was the idea of being held responsible for your actions (short of outright fraud). Managers at publicly traded banks constantly exhorted their traders to do bigger and bigger deals and to take increasing amounts of risk, and then rewarded them with millions of dollars in compensation — money that belonged to shareholders. Reputations were made not by turning down imprudent business but by seeing how much business could be done.The fallout of 25 years under this compensation system is strewn everywhere; the inevitable consequences of encouraging smart people to take risks, free of accountability, with other people’s money are easy to fathom. As innovative products emerged on Wall Street, the compensation system pushed bankers and traders to sell them, to inevitable and disastrous extremes.It was the gorging on high-yield bonds that led to the Crash of 1987 and to the credit crunch that followed. The feast of Internet public offerings led to the equity bubble that exploded in March 2000. Excessive issuing of debt for emerging telecommunications companies resulted in the frauds at WorldCom and Enron, among others. And, of course, the huge rewards given to bankers, traders and Wall Street executives for manufacturing mortgage-backed securities have led to our current predicament.There has never been a better moment to correct this deeply flawed system. For starters, where is it written in stone that bankers and traders have to be paid millions of dollars for their services? The gibberish about needing to pay that much just to keep superstars from fleeing to private-equity firms or hedge funds is just another Wall Street myth. The truth is most of them are lucky to have a job at all and they know it.Since compensation has historically consumed half or more of every dollar of revenue generated on Wall Street — what other business even comes close? — there is no better way for companies to improve their profitability than by drastically cutting this expense. And a revamped Wall Street pay structure could be further enhanced through new accountability. One idea is creating escrow accounts at each firm made up of, say, one-third of each year’s allocated compensation, which would be distributed to employees over the next three years — after the account is reduced by losses resulting from poor trades or deals and legal judgments against bankers and traders resulting from their rash behavior. The escrow accounts would reinforce the idea of prudently generating revenue.Instead of fretting over government intrusiveness, titans like Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase, Ken Lewis of Bank of America, Lloyd Blankfein of Goldman Sachs and John Mack of Morgan Stanley should be dancing a jig that Mr. Waxman and Mr. Cuomo have given them cover to make the one change on Wall Street that would help their bottom lines and prevent the tragic cycle of lurching from one financial crisis to another. But if they don’t, then the new secretary of the Treasury should help them see the light.'"
"'08-11-16,'0','If Hillary wants to be Madame Secretary, Bill will have to put away the 81-page list and pick up the 63 questions in the Obama vetting questionnaire, an unprecedented deep probe of potential cabinet members and their spouses.Even if Bill scurries past the questions on sexual harassment claims, conflicts of interest, civil suits, real estate holdings, federal investigations, diaries, gifts worth more than $50 and Internet aliases, the Clintons will still have to grapple with No. 8: “Briefly describe the most controversial matters you have been involved with during the course of your career.” (It would take books, and it has.)Not to mention No. 62: “Do you know anyone or any organization ... that might take steps, overtly or covertly, fairly or unfairly, to criticize your nomination, including any news organization?”In his desire to channel the character of Lincoln and create a team of rivals on his cabinet, Obama may be willing to overlook the array of conflict-of-interest issues posed by the rivals he vanquished.(Lincoln appointed a New York senator, William , as his secretary of state. He promptly bought , known as “Seward’s Folly,” which ended up bringing us the folly of ).There are Obama aides and supporters who are upset that The One who won on change has ushered in déjà vu all over again. The man who vowed to deliver us from 28 years of Bushes and Clintons has been stocking up on Clintonites.How, one may ask, can he put Hillary — who voted to authorize the war without even reading the intelligence assessment — in charge of patching up a foreign policy and a world riven by that war?You can hear the gnashing of teeth from — who thought the job was promised to him in return for his endorsement after — and Bill Richardson, who met Friday with Obama in to discuss the job.And would probably like a little less blond ambition at State so he could be the shadow secretary. But as has said, a campaign is the time to stab your enemies and a transition is the time to stab your friends.Hillary is probably ready to ankle out of the Senate. The point of the Senate was to be a staging area for her presidential race, and that’s done.She’s not a player there. Her bid to get the health care issue away from was stymied recently when Kennedy refused her request to create a special subcommittee that she would head.And why should the woman who made 18 million cracks go back to being junior to , if she could be toasted from to ?On the down side, Hillary would be taking over a big and demoralized government bureaucracy, after proving with her campaign that she does not know how to run a big and demoralized group of people.On the up side, she would never have to exaggerate her foreign policy résumé again; this time, she really would be brokering peace and flying into places where they’d try to fire at her.And if she worked hard enough — and she would — she could restore clarity to Foggy Bottom, the striped-pants center of diplomacy so maligned and misused by W. and on their Sherman’s march to war in Iraq and in their overwrought bid to become the only hyperpower.If Barry chooses Hillary as secretary of state, a woman who clearly intimidated him and taught him to be a better pol in the primaries, it doesn’t signal the return of the Clinton era. It says the opposite: If you have a president who’s willing to open up his universe to other smart, strong people, if you have a big dog who shares his food dish, the Bill Clinton era is truly over.Appointing a Clinton in the cabinet would be so un-Clintonian.'"
"'08-11-16,'0','“A credit crunch can drive people into bankruptcy today rather than later as sources of lending dry up,” Professor Lawless said. “With the consumer credit tightening and the economy in a nosedive, this pop could just be the beginning of a long-term rise in the bankruptcy filing rate to levels that are even higher than we had before the 2005 bankruptcy law.”Not only are filings up, but recent filers have had much more credit card debt, often run up in an attempt to keep current on a mortgage that now exceeds the value of their home, bankruptcy lawyers said in interviews.A recent study found that the typical family who filed for bankruptcy in 2007 was carrying about 21 percent more in secured debts, like mortgages and car loans, and about 44 percent more in unsecured debts, like credit cards and medical and utility bills, than filers in 2001.Their incomes, meanwhile, remained static over those six years, according to the study, which used data from the 2007 Consumer Bankruptcy Project, a joint effort of law professors, sociologists and physicians. Researchers surveyed 2,500 households nationwide that filed for bankruptcy in February and March 2007.“Earlier downturns followed strong booms, so families went into recessions with higher incomes and lower debt loads,” said Elizabeth Warren, a professor at Law School and, along with Professor Lawless, part of the Bankruptcy Project team. “But the fundamentals are off for families even before we hit the recession this time, so bankruptcy filings are likely to rise faster.”Not surprisingly, filings are increasing most rapidly in states where real estate values skyrocketed and then crashed, including , and . In Nevada, bankruptcy filings in October were up 70 percent compared with last year. In California, bankruptcies jumped 80 percent in the same period, while Florida’s filings rose 62 percent.In those regions, some people are trying to rescue their homes through bankruptcy proceedings, but many are just as relieved to walk away, shedding layers of debt that otherwise would have taken decades to pay off.Tony and Carrie Forsyth, both 30, chose not to walk away from their house in Florida. The couple said they thought their financial situation would improve in 2006, when Mr. Forsyth accepted a promotion from his employer, a food distributor, that required them to move to Florida. But they could not sell their home in Ypsilanti, Mich., so they decided to rent it out.In June 2006, the couple headed south and bought a house for $220,000 in Tamarac, Fla., with no money down. Five months later, their tenants in Michigan stopped paying, and the family had to carry two mortgage payments, just as the adjustable-rate mortgage on their Michigan home reset to a higher interest rate. They lost the Michigan home to foreclosure in February 2007.By that time, however, the couple, who have two young daughters, were using credit cards to pay for food, utilities and clothes. After accumulating about $20,000 in debt, they said, they realized that bankruptcy was the only way they could remain in their Florida home, whose value, meanwhile, had plunged 25 percent. They filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy protection this year, which permitted them to keep the house, and they agreed to repay a portion of their debts over the next three years.A Chapter 7 bankruptcy, by contrast, provides filers with what is known as a “fresh start” because debts are forgiven. In this case, assets are liquidated, though the states allow for various exemptions. To qualify for a Chapter 7, filers need to pass a means test to determine whether they are unable to repay their debts.Filers who are deemed able to repay a portion of their debts must file for Chapter 13 bankruptcy. Some debtors choose Chapter 13 because it permits them to save their primary homes from foreclosure, though they are required to catch up on their mortgage payments.Mr. Forsyth said declaring bankruptcy was a difficult step. “Because of our Christian background, it didn’t feel right,” he said. “But there was no other way for us to live and support our family unless we went that route.”Mrs. Forsyth added: “We are just rolling with life. You have to eat. You have to have diapers.”The Forsyths are emblematic of the new forces that have led to the sharp rise in bankruptcy filings. “Historically, a person would get behind in his mortgage because of a temporarily catastrophic financial event, such as job loss, divorce, illness,” said Chip Parker, a bankruptcy lawyer in , Fla. “However, when these adjustable-rate mortgages started resetting from their teaser rate and clients couldn’t refinance their way out of trouble, they were getting behind even though there was no catastrophic event.”Bankruptcy lawyers report that they have been having more consultations with middle-class families with six-figure incomes — including many who either bought a home during the boom or pulled out most or all of their available home equity just keep to up with the cost of living. Also caught up in the bankruptcies are real estate investors, who hoped to flip properties they had bought near the height of the market.“There are a lot of foreclosures that haven’t taken place yet because people still have available credit,” said Jeffrey H. Tromberg, a bankruptcy lawyer in , Fla. “We don’t see them until they’ve maxed out their credit cards.”A similar pattern has emerged in , where more people are filing for Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection because it makes more financial sense to walk away from their homes. Real estate values have plummeted, and now the local economy is also suffering. Car salesmen and casino dealers are being laid off. Valet parking attendants and masseuses are collecting less in tips.“My clients are basically good people that got into a home the best way they could and can no longer meet their obligations because their income has gone down,” said Roger P. Croteau, a lawyer in Las Vegas who concentrates on bankruptcy. “There is no equity to pay off their credit cards, and they are maxed out. They haven’t saved enough because of housing costs.”Ellen Stoebling, a bankruptcy lawyer in Las Vegas, added: “People are using their cards to try and hold onto their property for as long as possible in hopes they can somehow talk some sense into their lender and stay in the property.”The problems are not limited to people with adjustable-rate mortgages and homes that are now worth less than they owe. Job losses are also playing a role. Bankruptcies are also up sharply in , and , where the unemployment rates have been climbing.And, of course, some people continue to seek bankruptcy for the usual reasons.Lisa Marquis, a 35-year-old mother of five in Indiana, has no medical insurance but has undergone 21 operations in the last nine years, some related to and other , and others related to accidents and several .Mrs. Marquis cannot work, but her husband earns $13.50 an hour as a truck driver — a salary that makes them ineligible for but unable to pay their medical bills. Earlier this year, the family had to leave the mobile home they owned because the mold there was making it hard for her to breathe; they moved into a house where they paid more than $600 a month in rent. Mr. Marquis was spending three days a week in court fending off angry creditors, cutting down on the number of hours he could work.In April, facing more than $114,000 in medical bills and less available overtime work, the Marquises filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy — the third time in less than 10 years that Mrs. Marquis had to file for protection because of medical bills. Because the latest filing is a Chapter 13, they have agreed to pay some of their debts.“We could have waited to do a 7,” Mrs. Marquis said. “I want to pay my debts. I didn’t want to cheat people who helped to save my life.”Despite the rise in bankruptcies, academics and lawyers say they believe that many others have been discouraged from filing because of the 2005 bankruptcy law.Ms. Warren, the Harvard law professor, said many borrowers had been left with the mistaken impression that they could no longer file. And, she argued, “the widespread perception that bankruptcy is not available to help families makes this economic crisis worse.”'"
"'08-11-16,'0','HOUSTON — State officials said late Friday that they had begun dismantling one of the largest dogfighting rings in the country that night, arresting eight people and seizing 187 dogs used by a sophisticated network of bettors throughout eastern Texas. Investigators continued to search for suspects Saturday.In all, 55 people were indicted after an undercover investigation that lasted 17 months. Officials said the network’s matches drew crowds of up to 100 people, who placed tens of thousands of dollars in wagers on a single fight.“This was a large-scale, highly organized operation,” said Lisa Block, a spokeswoman for the Texas Department of Public Safety.It was not uncommon for a gambler to put $500 to $1,000 down on the matches, which took place weekly or twice a month at eight sites in secluded parts of Harris County, where Houston is the largest city, law enforcement officials said.The events were by invitation only. “They didn’t go out in the street and advertise it,” Ms. Block said. “They would spread the news among themselves.”Because the ring members invited only people they knew to the fights, undercover agents from the state police infiltrated the group to gather evidence and even managed to videotape some of the matches, officials said. The investigation started after troopers received a tip from someone in another state about the fights, Ms. Block said.Many of the participants in the ring bred the dogs themselves, buying and selling animals back and forth with other members. Most of the dogs seized were pit bull mixes bred and trained to fight. They were kept in large kennels in rural areas northeast of Houston. Some of the dogs had been injured in fights and were being cared for by the Houston Humane Society.'"
"'08-11-16,'0','The use of the most common type of retardant, a fertilizer-like, phosphate-based compound, can vary by state or by who oversees the land where a fire is spreading. Among federal agencies, the Park Service is relatively cautious with retardant because part of its mission is to protect natural and cultural resources for public use. The State of California, however, has the largest aviation fire operation of any state and uses retardant aggressively not only to contain fires — retardant’s intended purpose — but also to try to extinguish them before they reach populated areas.The Forest Service, which oversees the largest share of the nation’s wildfire-fighting operations, has a laboratory devoted to testing retardant produced by private companies. In a sign of how contentious the issue has become, the agency is being sued in federal court in Montana by a group that says retardant threatens endangered species, including salmon, a claim the agency rejects.“We have the same environmental concerns as anybody,” said Tory Henderson, branch chief for equipment and chemicals at the Forest Service. “We always are looking for a more environmentally friendly product.”Airplanes and helicopters have long worked in concert with ground crews to fight big wildfires. When used effectively, retardant draws a chemical line in the landscape that can keep a fire from spreading while ground crews work to get it under control. But it can also be little more than a red streak of false reassurance, coating hillsides and the occasional house in what critics say is too often an ineffective, expensive public relations effort to appease the increasingly dense populations living in wildfire-prone areas.Government budgets for fighting wildfires have soared in recent years, reflecting a more assertive approach that critics say places too much emphasis on putting out fires that occur naturally in arid parts of the West.“It’s just bombs away,” said Timothy Ingalsbee, a former wildland firefighter who now heads Firefighters United for Safety, Ethics and Ecology.Still, many people who fight wildfires say that some of the resources that people are concerned will be damaged by retardant could potentially be lost to fire. Even in national parks, where some officials have called off the use of retardant to protect historic structures or wildlife from the chemicals, others have requested more retardant. And in more developed areas, particularly in California, the loudest critics of fire policy are those who want more use of retardant, not less, fire officials say.“The second we don’t, they’re calling us: ‘Where are you?’ ” said Mr. Payne, of the state fire department. Speaking of the environmental threats of retardant, he said, “It’s the people whose houses are not on fire that are concerned about it.”In the federal lawsuit in Montana, the Forest Service is being sued by a group of current and former employees and others who are demanding that the agency conduct a comprehensive environmental study of the impact of retardant under the Endangered Species Act. The suit cites a 2002 retardant drop on a river in central Oregon that killed 20,000 fish.Current federal policy encourages pilots not to drop retardant within 300 feet of a body of water, but it allows for exceptions if flying conditions require it or if lives or property are in danger. By 2011, according to officials with the Forest Service in Montana, the most common type of retardant will have lower amounts of ammonia and will therefore be less harmful to fish and aquatic environments. Private companies have also used other chemicals to develop gels and foams that are popular among some firefighting agencies, though retardant is used by most.The Forest Service says that the number of cases it has found where retardant affected waterways is so small — 14 out of thousands of retardant drops since 2000 — that mitigation measures already in place suffice.In January, the judge in the Montana case, Donald W. Molloy, threatened to jail the head of the Forest Service, Mark Rey, and to halt its use of retardant because it did not respond to court orders on time. After a hearing the next month, Judge Molloy decided against jailing Mr. Rey and allowed the use of retardant to continue. But Judge Molloy let the case proceed, and last month the plaintiffs asked him to make a decision in the case.“The chance of some stream being hit by retardant is virtually certain, and so, of course, you have to consider the consequences,” said Andy Stahl, executive director of the group that brought the suit, Forest Service Employees for Environmental Ethics. “It’s already happened 14 times.”In California in September, retardant-dropping planes were called in when the 3,700-acre Hidden Fire rushed toward a ridge above a complex of caves in Sequoia National Park. Then a cave expert and others in the park warned that the retardant could seep into underground streams that were home to rare spiders and isopods. The drops were stopped, and the Park Service approved a study of whether the cave streams were affected.“Fire is not new,” said Joel Despain, the cave expert. “We know that these animals and these caves must have been through fires in the past, because there were fires here in the 1920s. But the retardant is something new. That’s something these animals have not seen before.”'"

"'08-11-16,'0','Although the Playgirl Web site is still running, the graphic content is geared more toward gay men. None of the magazine’s editors are involved.Ms. Caldwell said Playgirl magazine suffered from the twin malaises of rising costs and declining sales; Blue Horizon Media did not return repeated calls for this article.Playgirl’s passing certainly will not be lamented as would the death of a more respected, or even a mildly respected, magazine. Yet for its writers and fans, something tangible has been lost in its closure.“It was almost a way to get back at Playboy,” said Pamela Des Barres, the famed former rock groupie, who wrote a music column for Playgirl. “It was a great idea, and it could have been done better. It did offer women a way to see some gorgeous hot, young, sexy guys, and nothing’s wrong with that.”Playgirl was started 35 years ago as a feminist response to Playboy and Penthouse. (Playboy sued Playgirl in 1973 for trademark infringement; the suit was settled amicably.) Over the years, the magazine changed ownership, began catering more to gay men, and whittled its operations down. Still, the magazine drew an avid readership, Ms. Caldwell said, selling 600,000 copies per issue in more than three dozen countries.In contrast to much of the slender offerings of pornography aimed at women, which tends to be softer and more story-driven than that marketed toward men, Playgirl was in-your-face.Now the three editors’ nudie magazine with feminist leanings is gone, and with it, strange and exciting career moments.“I think a different kind of porn is very degrading to women, but the kind of stuff we were peddling was about what women wanted,” said Ms. Caldwell, who is 26. “For better or worse, this was a real blow for feminism. We were the only magazine that offered naked men to women.”In the end, Playgirl was run by a skeleton crew of these three editors, along with what Ms. Caldwell described as “a whole horde of eager unpaid interns.”Ms. Caldwell was a New Jersey girl who had helped run a community newspaper and graduated from Columbia’s journalism school; Ms. Collins has a master’s in creative writing from the New School; and Corinne Weiner, 26, the magazine’s designer for its last two and a half years, was a graduate of Pratt.Ms. Weiner and Ms. Caldwell got their jobs the old-fashioned way: by sending in a résumé. Landing such a high-profile job just four months out of graduate school seemed “so over the top,” Ms. Caldwell said. “In the end,” she said, “that was far greater than reservations I had.”Ms. Caldwell hired Ms. Collins after she wrote an essay for the magazine about orgasm-related migraines. Ms. Weiner was the only one who said she half aspired to a career in pornography publishing. “It definitely was bit intense at first,” she said. “But it really didn’t bother me. I’m definitely all about looking at naked dudes.”Playgirl shared offices with Blue Horizon’s other publications in a fluorescent-lighted hive of gray cubicles in an old Art Deco building near Grand Central Terminal. Outwardly, it seemed the blandest of places, were it not for the lurid photos and videos that filled workers’ computer screens.After being hired at Playgirl, each woman followed a similar trajectory of experiences:¶First week: shock at being inundated with photos of naked men; slight horror at catching sight of photos from Blue Horizon’s triple X magazines; terror at having to put out a magazine with only two other people.¶Second week: less shock, less terror, less horror. Amusement at all the full-frontal photos that regular Joes — plumbers among them — mailed in.¶Third week: the realization that one’s eyes are glazing over at the sight of photos of naked men, who all begin to look the same. Bewilderment at the letters from female fans, who wanted specific fantasies to appear. (A common theme: a naked man doing chores for the fully dressed lady of the house. The editors complied with a photo spread.)Ms. Caldwell was struck by how many people would assume she was an expert in sex and then go on to disclose highly private details about their lives. Ms. Weiner said her parents found her job “hilarious.” Ms. Collins’s parents were congratulatory, at first. But just after being hired, she called their home in eastern Connecticut and sensed some hesitation in her father’s voice.“ ‘I thought you were really into this,’ ” she said.“Yeah,” her father replied. “That’s before Mom went out and bought a copy of the magazine.”The editors strove to publish articles that were saucy but relevant. They printed articles about a campaign to take toxic chemicals out of cosmetics and about problems with Amsterdam’s red-light district. To her delight, Ms. Caldwell landed interviews with Jack LaLanne and Dolly Parton.A do-it-yourself ethic bloomed. The magazine had no marketing or public relations budget, so its editors sought to revive the Playgirl brand themselves, throwing parties at a Lower East Side bar. After Blue Horizon denied a request to finance a blog, Ms. Collins built one herself, starting it on WordPress, a free platform.Their efforts, the women said, got virtually no support; indeed, their higher-ups, all of them men, usually resisted their push to give the magazine editorial heft.Early in 2008, warning signs surfaced. While newsstands sales were up, Ms. Caldwell said, so were production costs. In the spring, subscription cards suddenly vanished; the staff members were told it was a cost cutting measure. Then they were told that issues would come out bimonthly. In July, a subscriber wrote to complain about a letter from Blue Horizon saying that Playgirl was no longer in print.Ms. Caldwell entered the office of an executive editor at Blue Horizon and asked: “Is there something you want to tell us?” After some blustering, she learned that the magazine’s end was near.And so began the death throes of Playgirl, which, for all its swinging history and sass, ended remarkably unremarkably.There were no final cocktails, no last hurrah. Instead, there was a frigidness between the Playgirl staff members and the other Blue Horizon workers. “It was kind of like a long breakup, where you’re both still living together and neither of you have left the apartment,” Ms. Weiner said.The magazine’s editors said they were never told why the magazine was shut down. But, they said, they were always struck by the paucity of ads.“I’m not a publishing expert, but it seems to me like it would be impossible to sustain a magazine on the quantity of ads Playgirl sold,” Ms. Collins said.ON the Monday of her last week, Ms. Caldwell was called into a morning meeting, where she received an awkward round of applause from Blue Horizon staff members. Two days later, the executive editor took Ms. Caldwell and Ms. Collins out for sushi. (Ms. Weiner had already left.)Ms. Caldwell’s last day was Oct. 3. Ms. Weiner and Ms. Collins were not around; they had already found new jobs — Ms. Weiner as an officer manager in Brooklyn, Ms. Collins as a copy editor at a male lifestyle magazine. (Ms. Caldwell now edits at Diamond District News.)By 6 p.m., Ms. Caldwell had nearly cleared her desk. She rode the No. 4 train home.'"
"'08-11-16,'0','In a letter (Nov. 2) complaining that you assigned someone who is not a political cartoonist to review Jules Feiffer’s collection of early political cartoons, Ted Rall writes, as if it were self-evident, “You wouldn’t let a food writer tackle a history book.”If Rall’s point is that only academics should review academic tomes, fair enough. But a book of history aimed at the lay reader? Why on earth shouldn’t a food writer be called upon to offer his opinion? Some of us are actually fairly well educated (I have a couple of B.A.’s from U.C.L.A. myself, in philosophy and, er, history), and we tend to be pretty well traveled.Even more to the point, the search for, production of, commerce in and shortage of foodstuffs have had enormous impact on humanity over the centuries (some keywords: spice trade, salt tax, Boston tea party, potato famine, biofuels) — and a lot of good food writing these days goes beyond recipes or restaurant critiques to address cultural and historical issues that have influenced the way we cook and eat. I’d go so far as to argue that a lot of food writers study and try to make sense of history on a daily basis, and quite possibly understand it at least as well as political cartoonists.Colman AndrewsRiverside, Conn.The writer is a founder and former editor in chief of Saveur magazine, a restaurant columnist for Gourmet magazine and the author of several cookbooks.'"

"'08-11-17,'0','A month into the Bush administration’s $700 billion bank , the effort has become as fractured as the ad hoc rescues that it was supposed to replace. As a result, the modest easing the bailout initially brought about in the credit markets is now being reversed over doubts about the Treasury’s stewardship of the plan.The rates for loans between banks have begun edging up again, and consumer borrowing costs are also up — that is, assuming consumers can find a bank willing to lend.President-elect ’s is reportedly planning how the new administration will better manage the bailout. But two months is a long time to wait while the Bush Treasury burns through the bailout billions, with little to show in terms of enhanced stability and even less in terms of enhanced confidence.Last week Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson outlined a complex new bailout strategy intended to promote consumer borrowing. Mr. Paulson defended this latest iteration, saying he would never apologize for changing his approach as the facts change. But it is not surprising that everyone else is feeling whiplashed.Before the bailout even got under way in October, Mr. Paulson had to sideline his original strategy — to buy up banks’ bad assets — because, he soon came to realize, it was too complex and indirect to deliver the swift jolt the financial markets needed.'"

"'08-11-17,'0','“None of us were fans of the notion of content or ideas being ‘viral,’ ” said Kirt Gunn, who has been president at Gunn and will be a managing partner at Dandelion, because “the metaphor of a virus is inherently unpleasant.”“We did, however, want to capture the notion that powerful ideas do self-propagate when the audience is connected by digital technology,” he added. Another benefit of Dandelion, Mr. Gunn said, is that it conveys “the constant reinvention” inherent in interactivity in that “whether it’s blogging, content creation or social media, there will always be new dandelions on the lawn.”Dandelion will be half owned by Epoch and half by Mr. Gunn; the financial terms are not being disclosed. Dandelion will start with 14 employees in New York and Los Angeles and plans are being made for a presence in London.Epoch, founded in 1989, has about 25 employees in offices in New York, Los Angeles and London along with a roster of directors who work with the company to make commercials and movies.Among them are Matt Aselton, who directed “Gigantic,” a film to be released in 2009, and a series of spots for the Old Spice line of grooming products sold by Procter & Gamble; Phil Morrison, who directed “Junebug” and the popular series of “Get a Mac” spots for Apple; and Jeff Preiss, a partner at Epoch who directed commercials for Monster.com and Nike.Epoch’s directors can “get the selling points across in a fun, interesting way,” said Mark Fitzloff, executive creative director at Wieden & Kennedy in Portland, Ore., who worked with Mr. Aselton on Old Spice.The directors are “super-collaborative,” he added, “and you wouldn’t flinch about bringing them into the ‘pre-pro’ meetings with your client, which is worth its weight in gold.” The reference was to the preproduction process that takes place after a commercial is approved and before filming.Dandelion will let Epoch “go much deeper than what we offer as a production company,” said Mindy Goldberg, president and co-owner at Epoch, who will be a managing partner at Dandelion. “We were seeing the market in the last few years moving more and more toward branded-content creation,” she said, “a model very different from representing a roster of directors and selling them to agencies to execute ideas.”By contrast, Dandelion will follow “an A-to-Z model,” Ms. Goldberg said, “collaborating with the ad agencies to come up with ideas, create the Web sites, the social networking, and tracking it all.”To help accomplish that, Dandelion is signing writers for projects that will integrate brands into the plot lines of stories. Ed Herbstman, who has written for Sacha Baron Cohen’s “Da Ali G Show,” will be the head writer.Among the other writers are Eric Gilliland, of sitcoms like “My Boys,” “Roseanne” and “That ’70s Show”; Scott Sherman of The Onion and the parody “The Dangerous Book for Dogs”; and Charlie Todd, the creator of a roving band of pranksters, Improv Everywhere, perhaps best known for the annual “No Pants” ride on the New York City subway.Some projects from Mr. Gunn and his company have been just as unconventional. For a line of ThermaCare products from Procter, which treat women with menstrual pain, Gunn developed two Web sites, video clips and a fake documentary. They all pretend to be the life’s work of an imaginary institute that studies the make-believe problem of “cyclical nonuterine dysmenorrhea” — i.e., men with cramps.“Kirt got my attention because he was one of the pioneers of storytelling on the Web,” said Ty Montague, co-president and chief creative officer at JWT North America in New York, part of the JWT unit of the WPP Group.“Storytelling is more important than mere entertainment,” said Mr. Montague, who is collaborating with Mr. Gunn on a project to be announced later. “It’s fundamental to what we do.”Selling by telling also has benefits in an economic downturn, to hear the executives of Dandelion tell it.“We’re in a time when brands have to be more efficient with money,” Mr. Gunn said, “and more considerate of people’s time.”That means marketers telling sponsored stories must be more careful not to breach the fine line between content and commercialism, he added, because “if we just stick products into content, that has the same feeling to consumers as driving down the road and seeing a billboard.”Other Dandelion executives will include Jerry Solomon, managing director, who is also a partner at Epoch with Ms. Goldberg and Mr. Preiss; Tara Averill and Mal Ward, who will share the sales and development duties; Greg Lofaro, director for design and technology; and Greg Schultz, executive producer.'"

"'08-11-18,'1','So far the only real money on the table is $25 billion that Congress authorized in September as part of an energy bill to help the auto industry re-tool their factories to make high-mileage vehicles, something the Big Three have resisted for a quarter of a century.Back in the 1980s and 1990s, a government-financed initiative like that would have been called “industrial policy,” which real capitalist democracies were supposed to avoid. When the Japanese perfected this approach — with a mix of research help, tax incentives and government “guidance” — American presidents would dispatch negotiators to demand a halt to the practice. The Japanese took them out to nice sushi dinners, gave them a police escort back to the airport, and ignored them.But in the past few days, the talk about using the government’s money to retrofit factories has begun to fade. Suddenly, the $25 billion is being talked about as a cash infusion to avoid layoffs or bankruptcies for the next few months. On Monday, , the White House spokeswoman, said President Bush would be willing to release the money if the Big Three “can show viability and a willingness to make tough decisions to restructure themselves.”A few minutes later, though, she made it pretty clear that this was not like the Chrysler bailout of the 1980s, or even the Mexican bailout of the 1990s — emergency loans on which the taxpayers ultimately made a profit. This is a giveaway, she acknowledged, saying there was virtually no chance that “the taxpayers would actually be paid back.”Suddenly, this sounds like money to stop the bleeding, not pay for retooling. If so, is this the best way to save jobs?David Yermack, a professor of finance at , made a case the other day in The that with the $465 billion Ford and G.M. have invested in their factories over the past decade, they “could have closed their own facilities and acquired all the shares of , , and .”Of course, the Japanese and the Germans weren’t selling. But the professor was making a deeper point: If the huge inefficiencies, the wrong mix of cars, the union contracts and the work rules leave no hope of saving G.M. and Ford from eventual bankruptcy, maybe the debate should explore alternative ways to spend the $25 billion and whatever follows.Professor Yermack’s half-facetious suggestion of “cutting each worker a check for $10,000” would not solve the problem, but there has always been a debate about whether helping foreign carmakers take over some of the American-based production facilities, and the dealer networks, might, in the end, save more jobs in the United States. It might also save the automotive suppliers, who would be among the first casualties if G.M. and Ford are forced into bankruptcy.President-elect has said his goal is to make sure there are jobs, and automotive production facilities, inside America’s borders. To President Bush, that always meant promoting American-owned companies; early in his term, when he invited carmakers to show off their innovative technologies on the South Lawn of the White House, foreign manufacturers who were the first to put hybrid cars on the streets were left off the guest list.So it was telling that on Monday, at the end of the Bush administration, there was a ribbon-cutting to open a new car plant in the United States in Greensburg, Ind. It belongs to Honda. The company has already begun hiring 2,000 workers to build four-cylinder Civics, including one model fueled by natural gas.'"

"'08-11-18,'1','The Australian brewer Lion Nathan made a hostile bid of 7.6 billion Australian dollars ($4.91 billion), for the soft drinks distributor Coca-Cola Amatil. The bid, a cash and stock proposal, values Coca-Cola Amatil at 10.35 dollars a share, a 25 percent premium over the closing price Friday. If successful, the acquisition would give Lion Nathan a 60 percent share in Australia’s soft-drink market, which is valued at 10.3 billion dollars, Reuters reported. Coca-Cola Amatil said the offer contained “a number of material deficiencies” and was “materially below recent multiples paid for domestic and international beverage companies.” It said the deal was unlikely to be supported by Coca-Cola of Atlanta, which owns 30 percent of Coca-Cola Amatil, its Australian distributor. Kirin Brewery, the Japanese beer maker, holds a 46 percent stake in Lion Nathan.

"'08-11-18,'1','Since he bought the Mavericks in 2000 with money he earned by selling his start-up, Broadcast.com, to Yahoo for $5.9 billion before the dot-com crash, Mr. Cuban has become one of the biggest lightning rods in American professional sports. From his seat behind the Mavericks bench, clad in his signature team gear, he has not hesitated in picking arguments, and has paid nearly $1.7 million in fines to the N.B.A.But he also turned around a flagging franchise, attracting star players and helping to bring the Mavericks to the brink of an N.B.A. championship in 2006.The charges could pose a problem for his dreams of a burgeoning sports empire. Mr. Cuban is widely reported to be the lead bidder for the Chicago Cubs baseball team, but he is thought to be too hot to handle by many of Major League Baseball’s current owners. The insider-trading lawsuit may only make his quest for the baseball team more difficult to fulfill.At issue in the S.E.C.’s lawsuit is Mr. Cuban’s sale in June 2004 of shares in Mamma.com, a small Internet search engine based in Canada, whose corporate name is now Copernic.Mr. Cuban had purchased 600,000 shares, or a 6.3 percent stake, just three months earlier as the stock was soaring. The share price tripled over a two-day period in early March on volume that totaled more than 12 times the number of outstanding shares. That prompted an S.E.C. investigation that ended without charges being filed.Scott W. Friestad, the S.E.C.’s deputy director of enforcement, said the investigation of Mr. Cuban’s trading began in early 2007, but declined to say what had set off the inquiry.On June 28, 2004, Mr. Cuban called Mamma.com’s chief executive after receiving an e-mail message from the executive, who told him of a planned stock offering and asked if he would like to invest. Such offerings often depress share prices, at least temporarily.According to the complaint, Mr. Cuban was told the information was confidential.After the conversation, the chief executive wrote to the company’s chairman in an e-mail message: “As anticipated, he initially ‘flew off the handle’ and said he would sell his shares (recognizing that he was not able to do anything until we announce the equity).”But within minutes of the call Mr. Cuban began selling his shares, and completed the sales on June 29, according to the lawsuit, fetching an average of $13.24 a share. The next day, after the offering was announced, Mamma.com stock opened at $11.89, sparing him a $750,000 loss. By July 8, the shares had plummeted to $8. On Monday, the stock closed at 28 cents.“Mamma.com entrusted Mr. Cuban with nonpublic information after he promised to keep the information confidential,” Mr. Friestad said. “Less than four hours later, Mr. Cuban betrayed that trust by placing an order to sell all of his shares. It is fundamentally unfair for someone to use access to nonpublic information to improperly gain an edge on the market.”In a press release (and in a post on his blog), Mr. Cuban accused the S.E.C. of being “infected by the misconduct of the staff of its enforcement division,” but did not discuss details of the suit.A person close to Mr. Cuban provided what he said was one of a series of e-mail messages from Jeffrey B. Norris, an S.E.C. lawyer in Fort Worth, who accused the billionaire of being unpatriotic for helping to finance a movie named “Loose Change.” In the e-mail message, Mr. Norris described the movie as a “vicious and absurd documentary” that “posits that President Bush planned the demolition of the World Trade Center as a pretext for going to war against Iraq.”In the e-mail message, sent from his S.E.C. e-mail address, Mr. Norris said he was informing Christopher Cox, the chairman of the S.E.C., of Mr. Cuban’s actions.“If this upsets you, I wonder how George Bush feels,” Mr. Norris wrote. “I assume that Mr. Cox would view your involvement with ‘Loose Change’ much as I do. After all, he served his country as a Republican congressman from Orange County for nearly 20 years and was appointed by President Bush.”An S.E.C. spokesman said that Mr. Norris had no role in or knowledge of the Mamma.com investigation, which was handled by the S.E.C. in Washington.He said the e-mail matter was “referred for disciplinary action,” but did not say what action, if any, was taken against Mr. Norris. Mr. Norris did not return a phone call.The S.E.C. spokesman said Mr. Cox had recused himself when the commission voted to approve filing the complaint. The S.E.C. has the authority to bring only civil suits, not criminal complaints. The Justice Department can file criminal insider-trading charges, but does so only rarely and did not in this case. Mr. Cuban presumably could have settled the S.E.C. case by paying the $750,000 and perhaps an additional penalty, and accepting an injunction barring him from further violations of securities laws.'"
"'08-11-18,'1','Here’s how it could work:First, let’s recognize that G.M. doesn’t need life support. What it needs is Chapter 11. The bankruptcy process is not a bad thing — indeed, it should be embraced. Bankruptcy allows companies to do tough things they could never do in the normal course of business. It has helped many companies turn themselves around and come out even stronger.Bankruptcy would give G.M. enormous leverage with its debt holders — and, perhaps more important, with the U.A.W., whose gold-plated benefits are one reason G.M. is no longer competitive. A bankruptcy filing would also give G.M. the cover to close plants, rid itself of unprofitable brands and shed dealerships. In fact, unless G.M. files for bankruptcy, state laws would make it prohibitively expensive to shut dealerships.So, first, the government would force G.M into a prepackaged bankruptcy now — even before policy makers may think it needs to be. As an inducement, the government would allow the merger with Chrysler to go forward. (There’s a lot of resistance to saving Chrysler too, but we need to look at the industry as a whole. And don’t worry: Cerberus, the private equity firm that owns Chrysler, would have its equity wiped out too.)The merger should reduce costs by as much as $7 billion. But that’s not the tough stuff. The harder decisions are these: Both companies would have to jettison brands — lots of them. In the case of G.M., frankly, the only ones worth saving are Cadillac, Chevy and Buick. (Buick? Yes. Despite its lackluster sales and fuddy-duddy image in the United States, it’s a huge seller in China.)That means Saturn, Pontiac, GMC and Saab would all disappear. Deutsche Bank estimates that reducing G.M.’s brands from eight to three would bring down the company’s cost base by $5 billion annually. If you’re able to shut the dealerships too, lop off another $4 billion. Chrysler is an even sadder situation: the only brand with any value is Jeep. Its Dodge Ram truck lineup could be merged with Chevy, which would also pick up pieces of the GMC business. And Chrysler’s minivan business could be combined into the Chevy brand as well.In all, the 35 plants of G.M. and Chrysler would probably be cut by half.Then the auto workers, whose benefits are off the charts.G.M. currently employs about 8,000 people who actually don’t come to work. Those who do go to work are paid about $10 to $20 an hour more than people who do the same job building cars in the United States for foreign makers like Toyota. At G.M., as of 2007, the average worker was paid about $70 an hour, including health care and pension costs.Those costs are already coming down slightly because of a renegotiated deal with U.A.W. last year, but not nearly enough.Part of the problem is summed up by comments like this one in The Detroit Free Press, made by Kandy O’Neill, 39, an assembler at G.M.’s plant in Lake Orion, Mich., where she builds the Chevy Malibu and Pontiac G6. “I think we’ve given enough,” she said about the cuts to her salary and pension plan.“Everybody wants to come down hard on the workers,” she said. “Nobody knows what we do inside there but the people who work there. It’s hard. It is not an easy job.”When you read a line like that you might sympathize with her, but then you realize that nothing can be accomplished without bankruptcy. Ms. O’Neill: your company is asking the taxpayers — many of whom don’t have health care coverage — to pay your salary and health insurance.And then we need these companies to agree to serious, strict enforcement of gas mileage standards. They should be producing the cleanest cars on the street. We may lose hundreds of thousands of jobs in this industry in the near term, but with the right kind of innovation, we should have millions of new jobs in the next 10 years.Finally, we need to kick out management. That Rick Wagoner, chief executive of G.M., can say with a straight face that he still deserves to run this company is laughable. It would be impossible for him to put in place the serious changes that need to be made because he carries too much baggage. He’d have to undo years of his own neglect.After all that is agreed, and only then, the government should come in with what’s known as debtor-in-possession financing to help the company through the bankruptcy process. Ideally, the government would be a “seed investor” and others would join it.The goal should not be to keep these companies from filing Chapter 11, but from filing for Chapter 7 — which would mean liquidation.With the debt market virtually closed, this is the time the government can come in and try to help. But to jump in front of the train now, without the requisite changes made to the industry first — which we all know can’t be done without Chapter 11 — would be foolish.The automobile industry has argued that bankruptcy will be a disaster for the industry; that people won’t buy vehicles while they’re in bankruptcy for fear that the warranty won’t mean anything. There’s a fix for that too. The government should establish a warranty insurance fund that would insure the warranties of all G.M. and Chrysler vehicles bought while the combined company is still operating under bankruptcy protection. The cost to taxpayers should be next to nothing, assuming the company survives and can takeover the warranty obligations.The government also should consider using some of the money for the financial industry rescue not to save the companies, but to retrain employees in the Detroit area and help promote development of new industry. A lot of people complain about the role of government in business and free markets. But it is hard to complain about efforts to make the nation’s workforce more employable.Barack Obama, on “60 Minutes” Sunday night, said that government assistance must be “conditioned on labor, management, suppliers, lenders, all the stakeholders coming together with a plan.” He said, “So that we are creating a bridge loan to somewhere as opposed to a bridge loan to nowhere.”Take note, Mr. Cervone: that bridge is called Chapter 11.'"
"'08-11-18,'1','But the White House, backed by Republicans on Capitol Hill, has instead proposed bolstering the auto companies by using $25 billion in federally subsidized loans already approved by Congress. Those loans were authorized earlier this year to help auto companies retool their plants to produce more fuel-efficient cars, but the money has been tied up while the government drafts rules for distributing it. Republicans say Congress could accelerate the process for making the money available, but some Democrats say those dollars should remain committed to the retooling.“We want the automakers to succeed and we support using an existing program to help them do so,” said White House spokeswoman Dana Perino. Ms. Perino said the administration preferred using the existing pool of funds set aside specifically for the auto industry rather than dipping into the $700 billion meant for financial institutions.Congressional Republicans say the auto companies, partially due to union contracts, have contributed to their own financial difficulties. Many Republicans also are pessimistic that a federal bailout would save Detroit.“The fact is they’re in trouble for reasons that relate to their own decisions rather than a lot of consumers out there who have gotten caught up in this credit crunch, in effect, through no fault of their own,” said Senator Jon Kyl of Arizona, the No. 2 Republican in the Senate.Another Republican, Senator James M. Inhofe of Oklahoma, called for Congress to freeze the Treasury Department’s underlying $700 billion bailout altogether, saying the current approach was veering too far from what Congress originally approved.“It is clear that it was a mistake to sign a blank check to one man for such a tremendous amount of money,” said Mr. Inhofe, referring to Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr.A showdown vote over the auto deal is set for Wednesday, and at the moment Democrats appear short of the 60 votes they need to move ahead, meaning the session is likely to be abbreviated.With the outlook dim for any legislation, lawmakers were already looking toward the start of the new Congress on Jan. 6. More than 50 new House members and 8 senators were on hand to start learning the ropes.Mr. Reid met with the six new Democratic senators, who will give Democrats a greater advantage in the new Congress. The final margin will depend on three races still to be decided in Alaska, Georgia and Minnesota.Those six new members — Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, Kay Hagan of North Carolina, Mark Warner of Virginia, Mark Udall of Colorado, Tom Udall of New Mexico and Jeff Merkley of Oregon — will be among the Democrats voting in party elections Tuesday before being sworn in on Jan. 6.“I’m so excited, so pleased and so happy to have a real majority now,” said Mr. Reid as he briefly paraded his new troops before the cameras.At the same time, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, huddled with two new Republican senators — Jim Risch of Idaho and Mike Johanns of Nebraska — who replaced retiring Republicans Larry E. Craig and Chuck Hagel respectively.In the House, the dozens of new Democrats and Republicans who will be joining the Congress in January were going through orientation and gathered for a bipartisan dinner Monday night in Statuary Hall of the Capitol, the original House chamber.“Your job title is the description of your work here: representative,” Speaker Nancy Pelosi said in remarks prepared for delivery at the private dinner. “I’m sure you agree that there is no higher honor.”Democrats expanded their House majority by more than 20 seats, up from 236, giving them commanding numbers in the House and sparking predictions by some that the party will move too far left and provide Republicans an opening in the next election. Counting Democrats elected to replace retiring members of their own party, more than 30 new Democrats will join the House.In a speech he is scheduled to give Tuesday at the National Press Club, Representative Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland, the majority leader, intends to dispute the notion that a strong Democratic majority will be more partisan.“The 33 new members of Congress coming to Washington to swell our side of the aisle are pragmatic, not dogmatic,” Mr. Hoyer said in a draft of his speech. “They were elected on promises of bipartisanship and fiscal discipline. They were elected, quite simply, to solve problems, not further politicize Washington.”'"
"'08-11-18,'1','The fledgling movement has reached a sufficient critical mass, its founders think, so they plan to form an association, angling for national advertising and foundation grants that they could not compete for singly. And hardly a week goes by without a call from journalists around the country seeking advice about starting their own online news outlets.“Voice is doing really significant work, driving the agenda on redevelopment and some other areas, putting local politicians and businesses on the hot seat,” said Dean Nelson, director of the journalism program at Point Loma Nazarene University in San Diego. “I have them come into my classes, and I introduce them as, ‘This is the future of journalism.’ ”That is a subject of hot debate among people who closely follow the newspaper industry. Publishing online means operating at half the cost of a comparable printed paper, but online advertising is not robust enough to sustain a newsroom.And so financially, VoiceofSan Diego and its peers mimic public broadcasting, not newspapers. They are nonprofit corporations supported by foundations, wealthy donors, audience contributions and a little advertising.New nonprofits without a specific geographic focus also have sprung up to fill other niches, like ProPublica, devoted to investigative journalism, and the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting, which looks into problems around the world. A similar group, the Center for Investigative Reporting, dates back three decades.But some experts question whether a large part of the news business can survive on what is essentially charity, and whether it is wise to lean too heavily on the whims of a few moneyed benefactors.“These are some of the big questions about the future of the business,” said Robert H. Giles, curator of the Nieman Foundation for Journalism at Harvard. Nonprofit news online “has to be explored and experimented with, but it has to overcome the hurdle of proving it can support a big news staff. Even the most well-funded of these sites are a far cry in resources from a city newspaper.”The people who run the local news sites see themselves as one future among many, and they have a complex relationship with traditional media. The say that the deterioration of those media has created an opening for new sources of news, as well as a surplus of unemployed journalists for them to hire.“No one here welcomes the decline of newspapers,” said Andrew Donohue, one of two executive editors at VoiceofSanDiego. “We can’t be the main news source for this city, not for the foreseeable future. We only have 11 people.”Those people are almost all young, some of them refugees from older media. The executive editors, Mr. Donohue, 30, and Scott Lewis, 32, each had a few years of experience at small papers before abandoning newsprint. So far, their audience is tiny, about 18,000 monthly unique visitors, according to Quantcast, a media measurement service.The biggest of the new nonprofit news sites, MinnPost in the Twin Cities and the St. Louis Beacon, can top 200,000 visitors in a month, but even that is a fraction of the Internet readership for the local newspapers.VoiceofSanDiego’s site looks much like any newspaper’s, frequently updated with breaking news and organized around broad topics: government and politics, housing, economics, the environment, schools and science. It has few graphics, but plenty of photography and, through a partnership with a local TV station, some video.But it is, of necessity, thin — strictly local, selective in what it covers and with none of the wire service articles that plump up most news sites.VoiceofSanDiego grew out of a string of spectacular municipal scandals. City councilmen took bribes from a strip club owner, a mishandled pension fund drove the city to the brink of bankruptcy and city officials illegally covered up the crisis, to name a few.A semiretired local businessman, Buzz Woolley, watched the parade of revelations, fraud charges and criminal convictions, seething with frustration. He was particularly incensed that the pension debacle had developed over several years, more or less in plain sight, but had received little news coverage.“I kept thinking, ‘Who’s paying attention?’ ” Mr. Woolley recalled. “Why don’t we hear about this stuff before it becomes a disaster?’ ”In 2004, his conversations with a veteran columnist, Neil Morgan, who had been fired by The Union-Tribune, led to the creation of VoiceofSanDiego, with Mr. Woolley as president, chief executive and, at first, chief financial backer.Most of this new breed of news sites have a whiff of scruffy insurgency, but MinnPost, based in Minneapolis, resembles the middle-age establishment. Its founder and chief executive, Joel Kramer, has been the editor and publisher of The Star Tribune, of Minneapolis, and its top editors are refugees from that paper or its rival, The Pioneer Press in St. Paul.MinnPost is rich compared with its peers — with a $1.5 million bankroll from Mr. Kramer and several others when it started last year, and a $1.3 million annual budget — and it has been more aggressive about selling ads and getting readers to donate.The full-time editors and reporters earn $50,000 to $60,000 a year, Mr. Kramer said — a living wage, but less than they would make at the competing papers. MinnPost has just five full-time employees, but it uses more than 40 paid freelance contributors, allowing it to do frequent reporting on areas like the arts and sports.If MinnPost is the establishment, The New Haven Independent is a guerrilla team. It has no office, and holds its meetings in a coffee shop. The founder and editor, Paul Bass, who spent most of his career at an alternative weekly, works from home or, occasionally, borrows a desk at a local Spanish-language newspaper.In addition to state and city affairs, The Independent covers small-bore local news, lately doing a series of articles on people who face the loss of their homes to foreclosure.With a budget of just $200,000, it has a small staff — some are paid less than $30,000 — and a small corps of freelancers and volunteer contributors. It does not sell ads, which Mr. Bass says would be impractical.“There’s room for a whole range of approaches, and we’re living proof that you can do meaningful journalism very cheaply,” Mr. Bass said.Crosscut.com, a local news site in Seattle, does reporting and commentary of its own, but also aggregates articles from other news sources. It began last year as a business, but is changing to nonprofit status.VoiceofSanDiego took yet another approach, hiring a crew of young, hungry, full-time journalists, paying them salaries comparable to what they would make at large newspapers and relying less on freelancers. Mr. Donohue and Mr. Lewis earned $60,000 to $70,000 last year, according to the VoiceofSan Diego I.R.S. filings.On a budget under $800,000 this year — almost $200,000 more than last year — everyone does double duty. Mr. Lewis writes a political column, and Mr. Donohue works on investigative articles. But the operation is growing and Mr. Woolley says he has become convinced that the nonprofit model has the best chance of survival.“Information is now a public service as much as it’s a commodity,” he said. “It should be thought of the same way as education, health care. It’s one of the things you need to operate a civil society, and the market isn’t doing it very well.”'"
"'08-11-18,'1','The question that drew one of the most emphatic responses from the regents concerned the viability of the Smithsonian’s policy of free admission at all of its components, which include 19 museums and galleries, the zoo and 9 research centers. The Smithsonian draws 70 percent of its $1 billion annual budget from the federal government.One written comment suggested that “the luxury of free admission must be a thing of the past.” The audience booed.Senator Christopher J. Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut and a Smithsonian regent, called the admission policy “one of the great hallmarks” of the institution.Calling attention to the Smithsonian’s unusual governance structure was the scheduled role of Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., who serves as the Smithsonian’s chancellor and traditionally presides over board meetings. At the last minute the chief justice was unable to attend and Mr. Sant presided instead. “We’ve been trying to do some fixing,” Mr. Sant said upon opening the meeting. “The board views this meeting as an opportunity to directly engage with all of you about the issues facing the Smithsonian.”Many questions were answered by G. Wayne Clough, the former president of the Georgia Institute of Technology, who took over in July as the Smithsonian’s secretary.He faces the task of restoring stability to an institution struggling with a $2.5 billion shortfall, crumbling buildings and a recent legacy of improprieties by leading Smithsonian executives. “We believe the Smithsonian is at a turning point,” he said in his opening remarks. “The world is rapidly changing in so many ways.”Like other organizations, the Smithsonian has been seriously affected by the nation’s economic downturn; the value of its endowment has dropped 21 percent since June. “Of course we can’t predict the future,” Dr. Clough said, “but we can prepare for it.”He said the Smithsonian had “to find ways to be more self-reliant.” The institution raised $135.6 million last year, he said, an improvement on its goal of $115 million.The developer and philanthropist Eli Broad, who serves as a regent, said the board had become more conservative about its investments.The organization has also raised $400,000 toward the $1.3 million cost of its strategic planning effort, Dr. Clough said. But he said that fund-raising was not enough and that the institution needed to set about attracting a younger and more diverse work force and audience.Dr. Clough said he had established a committee to ensure that executives at the institution — including regents, staff members and contractors — reflected the nation’s ethnic diversity. “The Smithsonian is the treasure of America and it represents America,” he said. “Therefore its Board of Regents should as well.”Several of the questions dealt with the Smithsonian’s neo-Classical 1881 Arts and Industries Building, which has been closed for four years and is listed by the National Trust for Historic Preservation as one of the nation’s most endangered places because of its state of disrepair.Dr. Clough said that the cost of repairs had been estimated at about $75 million and that the Smithsonian would conclude a study on its future use in January. One member of the audience suggested setting aside part of the building as an information center for all the institutions on the National Mall.The Board of Regents plans to hold open meetings at least once a year. The next one is expected in June. Mr. Sant said the board might adjust the format in the future.“We don’t have it exactly right,” he said. “But at least we’re trying to tinker with it.”'"
"'08-11-18,'1','“With the exception of BMW and Mercedes, European automakers haven’t been globally successful,” he said. “Nor have they been hugely profitable.”That comparative history is receiving new attention as Congress turns its attention this week to the fate of Detroit.The British Leyland bailout remains the classic example of a futile government intervention. The tight cooperation between governments and automakers on the Continent has produced happier results.For half a century after World War II, the French government was the majority stakeholder in Renault, and Paris still holds a 15 percent stake in the company. In the 1980s, the company received a bailout equal to nearly 4 billion euros, or $5.1 billion in today’s money. Now it is highly profitable — at least compared with its American counterparts.Today, G.M.’s German subsidiary, Opel, is appealing to Berlin for help, seeking more than 1 billion euros in credit guarantees, according to Carl-Peter Forster, G.M.’s European chief.Monday, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany said her government would make a decision before Christmas.“It’s not decided yet whether these loan guarantees will become necessary,” Mrs. Merkel told reporters in Berlin after meeting with Mr. Forster and other management and labor officials.“If these guarantees become necessary, those funds should remain within Opel” in Germany, she added, echoing a concern some Americans have expressed that any United States bailout money go only to American automakers.So far, Asian companies have not complained that such a bailout would amount to an anticompetitive subsidy. But José Manuel Barroso, president of the European Commission, said last week that he thought an aid package for Detroit could be “illegal” under World Trade Organization rules.That has not stopped European automakers from seeking 40 billion euros in loans from the European Investment Bank, ostensibly to help develop cleaner cars.For Garel Rhys, head of the Center for Automotive Industry Research at Cardiff University in Wales, the trajectory of General Motors is reminiscent of British Leyland not only because of the former’s decision to seek aid to avert bankruptcy, but also for its slow, seemingly inexorable loss of market share. “Both had a history of being the biggest in their market but couldn’t adapt as they lost sales,” he said. “They couldn’t get customers back.”Historically, British Leyland’s roots stretched back further than Henry Ford’s Model T. The company controlled 36 percent of the British market well into the 1970s, with mass-market brands like Austin and Morris and premium lines like MG and Jaguar. But rising competition from Japanese and German automakers, shoddy workmanship and a breakdown in labor relations brought the company to near bankruptcy by 1975, Mr. Rhys said.Michael Edwardes, who took over as British Leyland’s chief executive in November 1977, recalled that when he joined, no one even knew whether individual brands were profitable. “It was a farce — no one knew what the costs were,” he said.As it turned out, every MG the company sold in the United States resulted in a loss of $2,000 for British Leyland.Wildcat strikes consumed more than 32 million worker-hours in 1977, and the company became a symbol of labor strife, with some employees walking out the door with spark plugs in their coat pockets and engines in the trunks of their cars, Mr. Edwardes said.Mr. Edwardes immediately began reducing the company’s work force of roughly 200,000 — to 104,000 within five years — and closing 19 factories. He appealed to the Thatcher government for aid, arguing the money was needed if British Leyland was going to be able to afford to lay off workers while investing in new models.Eventually, the government put up £3.6 billion, equal to £11 billion in today’s money. But the rescue did not do much to preserve British Leyland’s labor force or market share in the long term.By the time it received its last government infusion of cash in 1988, Mr. Rhys said, British Leyland’s market share had slumped to 15 percent. British Leyland evolved into MG Rover, which was eventually acquired by BMW, then spun off, finally going bankrupt in 2005.According to Mr. Rhys, just 22,000 workers remain at British Leyland’s successor companies, about 10 percent of its work force in the mid-1970s.“It was a very poor return,” he said. “We felt collectively and nationally that we got our fingers burnt, and this was always used as a reason to avoid bailouts, both by Labor and Conservative governments in Britain.”Mr. Edwardes still defends the government aid, arguing it preserved parts of the company that remain in business now — like Jaguar and Land Rover, which were bought by Ford.Jaguar never made a profit for Ford, however, and was sold with Land Rover to Tata Motors of India earlier this year. Ford recouped only about half of what it paid to acquire the two brands, and is estimated to have poured $10 billion into Jaguar.Despite the British experience, the case of Renault, which combined fresh money and new management in the 1980s, showed that government bailouts can be beneficial.The French government help for Renault also came amid increasing losses for the company. But Mr. Rhys said that unlike British Leyland, Renault was able to use the financing to create new car models that were ultimately successful. That, along with tough cost-cutting by a newly installed chairman, cleared the road to profitability by the time the government began privatizing Renault in the 1990s.If Washington does go ahead and help Detroit, Mr. Edwardes said, it is crucial that the government overhaul the management of the Big Three. “Throwing money at them isn’t enough,” he said. “They need money and they need new management. They need both, not one or the other.”'"
"'08-11-18,'1','“This is a critical moment for ministers and politicians,” said Yvo de Boer, executive secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, at a news conference in Bonn, Germany. He called the coming climate negotiations “the most complicated process the world has ever seen.”Mr. de Boer said he found some cause for hope in the figures issued Monday. “What I saw was a slowing of the increase in emission from industrialized countries,” he said.But his statistician, Sergey Kononov, pointed out that the percentage decline had been so small that it could have been caused by either improved policies or simply the relatively warm 2005-2006 winter.Just one year ago, the United Nations climate agency convened the world’s environment ministers in Bali, Indonesia, where the group committed itself to hammering out a climate pact by 2009. Rich nations pledged to design a system to help the poor in coping with global warming.The current agreement, the Kyoto Protocol, expires in 2012 and does not cover the United States, which never ratified it, or developing nations like China.But the world has changed since Bali. The United States, a reluctant participant in the United Nations meeting last year, now has a president-elect, Barack Obama, who has pledged to make climate change a centerpiece of his administration.Perhaps more important, fallout from a global economic crisis has turned the economics of climate change upside down.On one hand, oil is now cheaper than in the recent past, making it tempting for struggling economies to fall back on this relatively dirty fossil fuel, rather than plowing ahead with efforts to develop less polluting alternatives, like wind and solar power.On the other hand, stagnant economies mean less industrial production, which historically leads to a drop in emissions.“It is clear that the financial crisis and subsequent economic downturn will have implications for climate negotiations,” Mr. de Boer said. But he added that “it will take time to see how.”In any case, Mr. de Boer said that the hoped the world would meet its climate goals by “relying on policy actions and not an economic turndown,” adding, “I hope never to be in the situation where we say we made our Kyoto target, but everyone is starving.”Indeed, he and others have expressed hope that some nations will renew their economies by investing in green jobs and green growth, a proposal put forth by Mr. Obama during the campaign and endorsed by nongovernmental organizations like the Clinton Foundation.United Nations officials said Monday that Mr. Obama would not attend the meeting, but expressed hope that the United States delegation would work closely with the next administration, which takes office in January.Unlike the Bush administration, Mr. Obama supports a cap-and-trade system, similar to the one that operates in the European Union. Companies and industries are assigned emissions limits and must buy “carbon permits” to exceed those limits. Such permits can come from investing in emissions-reducing projects such as planting trees or cleaning up a dirty coal mine in Asia, in theory “offsetting” environment damage done at home.Jeffrey D. Sachs, an economist who directs Columbia University’s Earth Institute, said the global financial crisis could well lead to a slowdown of emissions growth, though it was unlikely to reverse it.But he said it also provided an opportunity to restructure polluting industries, such as America’s automakers, which could be pressed to make high-mileage, low-emissions vehicles.With the new administration poised to take power in the United States, “I think everyone’s waiting for a discussion between the United States and China, the two biggest emitters and the two countries that haven’t been at the table,” Mr. Sachs said.'"
"'08-11-18,'1','I have always said that the decline in the housing market is at the root of the economic downturn and our financial market stress. And the economy, as it slows further, threatens to prolong this decline, as well as the stress on our financial institutions and financial markets.A troubled-asset purchase program, to be effective, would require a huge commitment of money. In mid-September, before economic conditions worsened, $700 billion in troubled asset purchases would have had a significant impact. But half of that sum, in a worse economy, simply isn’t enough firepower.If we have learned anything throughout this year, we have learned that this financial crisis is unpredictable and difficult to counteract. We decided it was prudent to reserve our TARP money, maintaining not only our flexibility, but also that of the next administration.The current $250 billion capital purchase program is strong medicine for our financial institutions. More capital enables banks to take losses as they write down or sell troubled assets. And stronger capitalization is essential to increasing lending, which is vital to economic recovery.Recently I’ve been asked two questions. First, Congress gave you the authority you requested, and the economy has only become worse. What went wrong? Second, if housing and mortgages are at the root of our economic difficulties, why aren’t you addressing those problems?The answer to the first question is that the purpose of the financial rescue legislation was to stabilize our financial system and to strengthen it. It is not a panacea for all our economic difficulties. The crisis in our financial system had already spilled over into the overall economy. But recovery will happen much, much faster than it would have had we not used TARP to stabilize our system. If Congress had not given us the authority for TARP and the capital purchase program and our financial system had continued to shut down, our economic situation would be far worse today.The answer to the second question is that more access to lower-cost mortgage lending is the No. 1 thing we can do to slow the decline in the housing market and reduce the number of foreclosures. Together with our bank capital program, the moves we have made to stabilize and strengthen Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and through them to increase the flow of mortgage credit, will promote mortgage lending. We are also working with the , the F.D.I.C. and others to reduce preventable foreclosures.I am very proud of the decisive actions by the Treasury Department, the Federal Reserve and the F.D.I.C. to stabilize our financial system. We have done what was necessary as facts and conditions in the market and economy have changed, adjusting our strategy to most effectively address the crisis. We have preserved the flexibility of President-elect and the new secretary of the Treasury to address the challenges in the economy and capital markets they will face.As policymakers face the difficult challenges ahead, they will begin with two considerable advantages: a significantly more stable banking system, one where the failure of a major bank is no longer a pressing concern; and the resources, authority and potential programs available to deal with the future capital and liquidity needs of credit providers.Deploying these new tools and programs to restore our financial institutions, financial markets and the flow of lending and credit will determine, to a large extent, the speed and trajectory of our economic recovery. I am confident of success, because our economy is flexible and resilient, rooted in the entrepreneurial spirit and productivity of the American people.'"
"'08-11-18,'1','In an effort to make irrigation more efficient — to obtain more “crop per drop” — farmers have adopted alternatives to flooding and other conventional methods. Among these is drip irrigation, shown above, in which water flows only to the roots. Drip systems are costly, but they save much water.Or do they? A hydrologic and economic analysis of the Upper Rio Grande basin in the Southwest, published in The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, suggests that subsidies and other policies that encourage conservation methods like drip irrigation can actually increase water consumption.“The take-home message is that you’d better take a pretty careful look at drip irrigation before you spend a bunch of money on subsidizing it,” said Frank A. Ward, a resource economist at New Mexico State University and author of the study with Manuel Pulido-Velázquez of the Polytechnic University of Valencia in Spain.With flood irrigation, much of the water is not used by the plants and seeps back to the source, an aquifer or a river. Drip irrigation draws less water, but almost all of it is taken up by the plants, so very little is returned. “Those aquifers are not going to get recharged,” Dr. Ward said.Drip irrigation also generally increases crop yields, which encourages farmers to expand acreage and request the right to take even more water, thus depleting even more of it. “The indirect effect is very possibly to undermine policy attempts to reduce water consumption,” Dr. Ward said.Policymakers, he added, must balance the need for more food and for farmers to make a living with water needs. “It’s fair to say that subsidies are very good for food security and very good for farmer income,” Dr. Ward said. “But they may be taking water away from other people.”'"
"'08-11-18,'1','It is difficult to overstate the importance of the role Jeffrey Milarsky has come to play in New York’s musical life. As a conductor and an educator at Columbia University and the Juilliard School, Mr. Milarsky helps to polish the skills and shape the interests of tomorrow’s professional musicians. He also leads the Manhattan Sinfonietta, a vital new-music group formerly associated with Columbia.Some of Mr. Milarsky’s most impressive recent work has been with the American Composers Orchestra. In a concert at Zankel Hall in April he demonstrated an estimable rapport with the ensemble. During a return engagement on Friday night he authoritatively conducted five disparate works, including three commissioned premieres.Kamran Ince’s “Domes” evoked a placid cinematic tracking shot across rooftops in Istanbul and Rome, with dissonant outbursts suggesting religious and cultural tensions. (The 1993 World Trade Center bombing and the Branch Davidian siege near Waco, Tex., occurred during the work’s gestation.) The playing had a luminous stillness, though there were patches of rough intonation among violins pushed to the top of their register.Fred Ho, an improvising saxophonist, bandleader and composer best known in jazz circles, was the soloist in his “When the Real Dragons Fly!” In his small bands and hybrid groups, Mr. Ho mixes Chinese and Western styles. Here, in his first piece for conventional orchestra, he deftly conveyed the spirit of his influences.Bluesy harmonies and thunderous brass riffs recalled the work of composers like Charles Mingus and Archie Shepp. Sunny pentatonic melodies and clangorous cymbals introduced Chinese elements without mawkishness.Mr. Ho, who recently fought off cancer, looked healthy and played with abundant energy. In his brawny solos he testified and roared with unbridled passion, and the orchestra served as an exuberant congregation.Gregory Spears and Keeril Makan explored the orchestra’s capacity for innovative timbre. Mr. Spears, whose music has figured in the orchestra’s Underwood New Music Readings, fashioned a dreamy suspense in “Finishing,” with fluttering flute and trumpet solos, tinkling percussion and shimmering strings made fuzzy with dog whistles and taped drones. In Mr. Makan’s “Dream Lightly,” the orchestra formed an enveloping haze around Seth Josel, an electric-guitarist. As Mr. Josel gently tapped the same note on different strings, harmonic overtones subtly shifted between chiming consonance and pulsating friction.'"
"'08-11-18,'1','Given the excitements of the past two weeks — the downfall, say, of the Bradley effect, or the (supposedly) remarkable voting patterns of the white working class — one could be excused for having thought that racial strife was over in America, that race itself could now be looked at quaintly, like an Edsel or a phone booth, as a vestige of the past.If that’s the case, however, then what is one to make of the bustling private office of the Rev. Al Sharpton? Every day — including Election Day — its telephones ring off the hook with complaints about bias in the workplace, prejudice in the classroom, deployments of injurious slurs, and abuse by the police.“Did we make a great milestone with Obama?” Mr. Sharpton asked, sitting at his desk the other day. “Of course, we did. Did it show America’s come a long way? Absolutely. Are we beyond racial inequality in America? If we are, nobody in this room got the memo.”“This room” is a small wood-paneled chamber squirreled away behind the old weight room of what used to be a power lifter’s gym in central Harlem. At first blush, it would seem like a museum of sorts, filled with old photos of James Brown, the Rev. Jesse Jackson, Betty Shabazz and the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. There are proclamations on the wall declaring Mr. Sharpton a crucial public this and a grand political that. The man himself, looking solemnly respectful, poses in a picture on the wall facing his desk that shows the shack in Clark Hills, S.C., where his great-grandfather, a slave on a plantation, once lived.It is, of course, a function of the Sharpton personality that one does not conceive of the man as holding down an ordinary day job at a desk. One’s mental reverend is forever on the run, pounding lecterns or marching over a bridge with his chin up. But, in fact, he comes to work each morning looking sluggish and exhausted just like anybody else: He checks his mail; he banters with the administrative staff; he takes a cup of coffee and reads The Wall Street Journal and The New York Times.Mr. Sharpton’s former office, near 125th Street, burned in an electrical fire five years ago and it is from this new one, on 145th Street, that he runs the business end of the National Action Network, his civil rights organization. It is here that he plans his many crusades, which on any given day are likely to be fleshed out on the enormous yellow pad that commands an easel in the middle of the room. It is also here that he holds meetings, with friends and foes alike. Recently, he entertained two rappers whom he scolded for being vulgar.

"'08-11-18,'1','Although some of the inspectors general have been notably quiet, others have vigorously investigated both current and former ministers and other senior officials, and the top echelons of Iraqi officialdom have found ample reason to fear them.In one case, investigations of a former electricity minister landed him in jail before he escaped and fled to the United States, and an Oil Ministry inspector general detailed extensive smuggling and extortion schemes that he said bedeviled the industry. A former public works minister, a Kurd, complained before she fled the country that her ministry’s inspector general at the time, a Shiite, had been hyperactive and had brought charges based more on political considerations than actual wrongdoing.How many of the ministries have received orders to dismiss their inspectors is a matter of disagreement among Iraqi governmental officials, but their estimates range from a handful to as many as 17. Several senior Iraqi and American officials agreed that seven to nine inspectors general had already been dismissed or forced into retirement. In one case, at the Education Ministry, the post became vacant when the inspector general died.Senior Iraqi officials and four of the dismissed officials, many of whom asked not to be named for fear of government reprisals, said inspectors had already been removed in the Ministries of Water Resources, Culture, Trade, and Youth and Sport. In addition, inspectors have been removed from the cabinet-level Central Bank of Iraq, and from two religious offices, the Sunni Endowment and the Christian Endowment, whose leaders carry the rank of deputy minister.One senior Iraqi official said that the list of ministries whose inspectors had been dismissed also included the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, but the ministry’s public affairs office denied that on Monday.Three senior advisers to Mr. Maliki declined to comment substantively when contacted about the dismissals. “Definitely I know about it, all the details,” said Yasseen Majid, a press adviser to the prime minister. “But you know all the story, so why are you asking me? It’s not my specialty; it’s an administrative issue.”But Adel Muhsin, Mr. Maliki’s coordinator of anticorruption organizations and himself the inspector general at the Health Ministry, said any suggestion that there had been political motivation for the dismissals was false.“This is absolutely completely nonsense,” Mr. Muhsin said. The cabinet committee that recommended the changes, he said, was made up of “mainly professional people, not political people. Therefore, the selections. It is 100 percent based on professionalism.”The United States Embassy in Baghdad did not respond on Monday to a request for comment on the dismissals.But Stuart W. Bowen Jr., who leads an independent oversight office in Washington, the Office of the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction, and who is currently working in Iraq, said he knew of six of the dismissals. He said the inspectors general were vulnerable because once their offices were created, the United States provided little support and training for what was a startling concept for the bureaucracy, which was shaped by the secrecy and corruption of the Saddam Hussein era.Whatever the precise tally, the events have begun provoking accusations that Mr. Maliki, who has never been an advocate of having his government’s inner workings scrutinized, might leave the posts vacant or stack them with supporters of his party, Dawa. The secrecy surrounding the moves has magnified suspicions that the government aims to cripple the oversight mechanisms put in place after the invasion.“The government put a publicity blackout on it so they can do anything they like,” said Sheik Sabah al-Saeidi, a Shiite lawmaker with the Fadhila Party who heads the Integrity Committee in the Iraqi Parliament.When Parliament recently proposed a law formalizing the professional requirements that must be met by a candidate for inspector general, Mr. Saeidi said, Mr. Maliki’s cabinet strongly opposed it.“They want it to become a political appointment,” Mr. Saeidi said of the oversight position. “They are trying to restrict anticorruption efforts all over the country.”At least two of the officials who were forced out were Christian women, Hana Shakuri of the Culture Ministry and Samia Youssef Sha’ia of the Christian Endowment. But most are simply senior Sunni and Shiite technocrats who have been at their posts for years and in several cases were originally appointed in 2004 by L. Paul Bremer III, the top administrator for the Coalition Provisional Authority.Hassan al-Safi, who was forced out of his position in the Ministry of Youth and Sport after being placed on what he said was a government list of incompetent inspectors, said that he had degrees in law, economics and auditing, and was involved in the earliest anticorruption efforts in Iraq after the invasion.“If I am not competent, prove it,” said Mr. Safi, who said that he had already filed a lawsuit to force the government to renounce its assertion that he was not performing his job properly.Mr. Maliki’s stance on oversight was most vividly illustrated by his long-running feud with Judge Rathi al-Rathi, the former head of the Commission on Public Integrity, an oversight agency created by the Coalition Provisional Authority.After Mr. Rathi’s corruption investigations repeatedly embarrassed the Maliki government, the prime minister’s office supported corruption charges against Mr. Rathi himself. Mr. Rathi’s backers considered the charges to be trumped-up.Ultimately, Mr. Rathi was forced out and fled Iraq in the summer of 2007, saying he had received numerous threats to his life. He was recently granted asylum in the United States, said Chris King, a former United States Embassy official who was a senior adviser to the integrity commission.Mr. King said there had been continual political interference in Mr. Rathi’s investigations. When the commission or an inspector general built a case against an official, Mr. King said, frequently “that member of the Iraqi government would then go lobby the American ambassador and the prime minister.”The prime minister eventually replaced Mr. Rathi with Judge Rahim al-Ogaili. Mr. Muhsin, Mr. Maliki’s anticorruption coordinator, said the judge was one of three cabinet-level officials serving on the committee that had recommended dismissing the inspectors general.The others were Mr. Maliki’s chief of staff and the head of Iraq’s Board of Supreme Audit. None of the three officials responded to requests for comment on Monday.It was Mr. Rathi’s former chief investigator, Salam Adhoob, who testified before Congress in September that a previously undisclosed report by the Board of Supreme Audit had concluded that $13 billion in American reconstruction funds had been squandered through corruption.Mr. King said that the inspectors general were in many ways one of the last firewalls preventing the Iraqi government from keeping its operations largely in the dark. After the integrity commission, Mr. King said, “the only remnants of an independent investigatory arm looking into corruption in the government are the I.G.’s,” or inspectors general.'"
"'08-11-18,'1','Some successful works in the operatic canon are handed down with a built-in caveat, and for Prokofiev’s “Love for Three Oranges,” it would seem to be this: the music comes in second to the message. Prokofiev based his opera on Carlo Gozzi’s 18th-century commedia dell’arte parody in order to skewer the standards of 19th-century opera as represented by Wagner and Verdi. According to conventional wisdom, apart from a few famous orchestral excerpts, the score simply shows Prokofiev spinning serviceable notes for a work in which theatrical whimsy and spectacle are paramount.Nonsense. “Love for Three Oranges,” written in 1919 for a 1921 Chicago premiere, falls short in the creature comforts of Romantic opera; there are no heroic or heart-rending arias, no rousing choruses. Yes, that is part of the point. But a concert performance by the conductor Valery Gergiev and the Kirov Orchestra and Chorus of the Maryinsky Theater at Avery Fisher Hall on Sunday afternoon was a reminder that this opera is an endlessly inventive, vividly characterized musical entertainment in its own right.Of course, it helps to have performers as intimately acquainted with Prokofiev’s idiom as these. Mr. Gergiev and his players gave the fast-moving comedy a crisp, buoyant tone. The low brass players and the contrabassoonist played solos with such ribald bite that they deserved individual lines in the cast credits.Chief among Mr. Gergiev’s assets was his unfailing ability to judge just how much vulgarity and violence to inject into the opera’s more black-hearted gags. Equally important, he milked tender melodies, like the Act III love duet, to sensual effect. Again and again in this performance, you marveled at the rightness and creative flair with which Prokofiev delineated character in a few well-chosen strokes.Outstanding among a cast of fine singers were Sergei Semishkur, a bright-voiced tenor, as the jester Truffaldino; Alexei Markov, a baritone, whose dark, cultured sound lent menace to his Leander, the conniving prime minister; Ekaterina Shimanovich, a dramatic soprano, whose sorceress Fata Morgana teetered between seductive cruelty and bawdy camp; and Ekaterina Sergeyeva, a soprano, who sang sweetly as the princess Linetta.The tenor Daniil Shtoda, as the Prince whose maladies set everything in motion, sang with an edgy, nasal tone but demonstrated considerable comedic flair. Alexei Tanovitsky, a bass, played the King of Cards with an appropriate touch of chaos. And Mr. Gergiev’s chorus was superlative.'"
"'08-11-18,'1','MOSCOW — A judge ruled on Monday that the trial of three men accused of involvement in the killing of the journalist Anna Politkovskaya should be open to the public, responding to her family’s concern that secret proceedings would harm the case.Ms. Politkovskaya was a crusading opposition journalist who covered the war in Chechnya and often criticized the Kremlin. Her killing in October 2006 brought widespread condemnation. She was gunned down as she entered her apartment building.The authorities have acknowledged that her assailant is still at large, but they have charged three men with providing logistical support for the killing.The judge, Yevgeny Zubov, warned that he would close the trial if there was evidence of jury tampering or other misconduct.A lawyer for the Politkovskaya family, Karinna Moskalenko, said the decision would add to the credibility of the verdict. “The public, especially in Anna’s case, they can and they must and they have to have the right to follow this case,” she said.'"

"'08-11-18,'1','And it came three days after Mr. Obama met with another former rival, Governor Bill Richardson of New Mexico, a former ambassador to the United Nations who might now be in competition with Mrs. Clinton for the State Department post.The Obama-McCain meeting in Chicago, an effort at reconciliation after a sometimes bitterly fought campaign, came unusually soon after Election Day.The president-elect and the Arizona senator hold relatively similar views on issues like climate change and ethics reform, where cooperation might be fruitful. More urgently, Mr. Obama may be hoping for help in pushing for a new economic stimulus package that faces stiff Republican resistance.Also taking part in the meeting were Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina and a trusted McCain ally, and Representative Rahm Emanuel, Democrat of Illinois, who is to be Mr. Obama’s White House chief of staff.Advisers to both Mr. McCain and Mr. Obama said that they did not expect Mr. McCain to be offered a job in the new administration.Mr. Obama said in an interview broadcast Sunday on the CBS program “60 Minutes” that there would be at least one Republican in his cabinet. He would not say when he might announce his first cabinet nominations, except to say “soon.”While the Obama-McCain meeting came earlier than some past efforts at reconciliation between newly elected presidents and their vanquished foes, the president’s father, George H.W. Bush, met on almost exactly the same date — Nov. 18 — with Bill Clinton after losing to him in the 1992 election.Mr. Clinton later called the meeting “very helpful,” though he found that his host wanted to talk almost exclusively about foreign affairs while he had hoped to pick the outgoing president’s brain on domestic affairs.In 2000, it was not until Dec. 19 that President-elect George W. Bush called on Vice President Al Gore, though that was just a week after the Supreme Court resolved the Florida recount debacle; the two spent less than 20 minutes together at the Naval Observatory, the official vice-presidential residence, where the elder Bushes themselves had once lived.In Chicago, Mr. Obama might be mindful of the fact that former rivals can also be future foes. In 2005, Senator John Kerry did not wait even a week after the inauguration of President Bush before launching into barbed attacks on his health care plan, calling it “window dressing.”'"
"'08-11-18,'1','Shares in Citigroup fell 6.6 percent, or 63 cents, to $8.89, after the bank announced it would lay off thousands more workers as it tries to put its financial house in order.The discount retailer Target and the Lowe’s home improvement chain joined the litany of major retailers whose profits have withered in the face of falling consumer spending.Target reported that its third-quarter profit fell 24 percent compared with the period last year, and that sales at stores open at least a year were 3.3 percent lower. Shares of Target fell 4 percent, or $1.35, to $31.68.Lowe’s reported a decline of 24.1 percent in net profit for the third quarter, and said it expected sales to continue to fall. Shares in Lowe’s fell from their midday highs, but ended regular trading up 4.2 percent, at $18.99.“We expect continued, broad-based external pressures on our industry, as rising unemployment, falling home prices, tight credit and volatile equity markets continue to erode consumer confidence and impact sales,” Robert A. Niblock, the chief executive of Lowe’s, said in a statement.Two new reports showed mixed news about America’s manufacturing and industrial sectors.In a bit of good news, the government reported that industrial output had a bigger-than-expected increase in October after plunging in September by the largest amount in more than 60 years. Industrial output rose 1.3 percent last month, the Federal Reserve said, reflecting a return to more normal operations after hurricanes in September.But industrial output has contracted severely in the last year, and was 4.1 percent lower last month than in October 2007. Production in nearly every sector, from consumer goods and office equipment to construction supplies and manufacturing, was lower than last year. Only mining production, driven by a spike in fuel and minerals prices earlier this year, was higher in 2008.The slide is expected to further reduce American exports in the months ahead.“Industrial production has really lost a lot of its momentum,” said Scott Anderson, senior economist at Wells Fargo. “The economy is looking like a wet noodle right now. There’s really no sector supporting growth outside government spending.”A report on manufacturing in New York State released Monday had no silver linings. It showed that conditions for manufacturers are the worst in the survey’s seven-year history, and said that measurements of new orders and shipments had skittered to record lows.With Japan and the euro zone now officially in recession, and after so many months of dismal financial news, some analysts wondered whether the market has finally priced in its expectations of lower profits and falling economic data.“Certainly no one can be surprised that we’re in a recession,” said Christopher N. Orndorff, head of equity strategy at Payden & Rygel. “It’s not like it’s new news to the market. It’s like piling on. It’s negative reinforcement.”Shares of General Motors were up 17 cents, to $3.18, and Ford ended lower by 8 cents, at $1.72, as Congress reconvened to discuss emergency legislation for the struggling automakers.The leaders of the Big Three automakers and the United Automobile Workers union were scheduled to testify Tuesday before the Senate Banking Committee amid uncertainty over whether Democrats can muster enough votes to get an auto-rescue bill out of the Senate.The December contract for crude oil fell $2.09, to $54.95 a barrel in New York.The Treasury’s 10-year note rose 23/32, to 100 27/32.

"'08-11-18,'1','“A change in policy need not come from this meeting,” the statement said, according to Reuters. “If a change in basic policy is considered necessary, there is a way that is democratic and which has the mandate of the Tibetan people.”The speculation has been fueled in part by comments from the Dalai Lama, who said this month that his drive to secure autonomy for Tibet through negotiations with the Chinese government had failed. That admission strengthened the hand of younger Tibetans who have long agitated for a more radical approach and who have demanded independence.Fierce denunciations by the Chinese government last week also bolster the hard-line position. A senior official, Zhu Weiqun, said at a news conference in Beijing last Monday that China would never accept the Dalai Lama’s demand for autonomy. The Dalai Lama, he said, intends to split up China, reinstate a theocracy and carry out the “ethnic cleansing” of Han Chinese.The rebuke, the harshest from the Chinese government since the violence last spring, contributed to the breakdown of talks between Chinese officials and envoys of the Dalai Lama that had been taking place since 2002. In the eighth and last round of talks, from Oct. 30 to Nov. 5, the Tibetan envoys presented the Chinese government with a memorandum detailing the Dalai Lama’s longstanding call for autonomy.“I think the breakdown of the talks between Beijing and the Dalai Lama is a major disaster, and it has now created a no-win situation for the Tibetans and China,” said Tsering Shakya, a Tibetan historian at the University of British Columbia.“Despite this approach receiving widespread appreciation from the international community, as well as the support of many Chinese intellectuals, there have been no positive signs or changes in Tibet,” he said.The meeting in India, he said, will allow Tibetans to discuss “in a spirit of equality, cooperation and collective responsibility the best possible future course of action to advance the Tibetan cause.” The Dalai Lama called for the meeting in September, but is not scheduled to personally attend.Robbie Barnett, a Tibet scholar at Columbia University, said the meeting appeared to be a forum in which the Dalai Lama would allow his more radical and frustrated compatriots to air their opinions but in which, working through his advisors, he would also try to consolidate support for a moderate, nonviolent approach.China’s recent statements, though, have made that task “much more difficult,” Mr. Barnett said.For decades, Tibet has been one of the biggest political conundrums facing the Chinese Communist Party. Tibetan self-governance ended when the People’s Liberation Army invaded the high-desert plateau in 1950, and nine years later the Dalai Lama fled to India.The Chinese government has tried to bolster the economy of the area it calls the Tibet Autonomous Region, whose gross domestic product of $5 billion in 2007 was the lowest of any region in China. But it has never allowed any form of Tibetan self-rule. Its policies on education and religion have frustrated many Tibetans, and the encouragement of Han Chinese migration to the Tibetan plateau fuels intense resentment.Anti-Chinese riots erupted in the Tibetan capital, Lhasa, on March 14 after the suppression of peaceful protests by monks. The government said at least 18 civilians were killed by mobs. Tibetans took to the streets in other towns as well, leading to a widespread crackdown. Exile groups said that scores of Tibetans were killed and that thousands had been detained or jailed.On Oct. 29, a day before Tibetan envoys arrived in China for the eighth round of talks, the British government announced that it was dropping its formal recognition of Tibet’s suzerainty relationship with China, a status that indicates real autonomy. The recognition dated back 94 years. Tibet advocates said the move by Britain, the only foreign power that had continued to recognize such a relationship, undermined the bargaining position of the Dalai Lama’s envoys and emboldened the Chinese government to reaffirm a hard-line position.All this has contributed to a growing sense of desperation among Tibetan exiles, and it could result in more support for groups like the Tibetan Youth Congress, which believes in pushing for independence.Lobsang Sangay, a Tibetan research fellow at Harvard Law School, said last week in an essay published on Phayul.com, a Tibetan news Web site, that participants in the meeting should avoid fiery words and creating a schism between those advocating for independence and those pushing for autonomy.The Chinese government has left no doubts as to its position. On Thursday, a Foreign Ministry spokesman, Qin Gang, said at a news conference that China hoped the Indian government would honor a promise to ban activities “aimed at splitting Chinese territory.”Chinese leaders, wary of the growing tensions, have apparently stepped up security in Lhasa. A reporter for the newspaper The Australian on a government-sponsored tour of Tibet this month wrote of armed security forces in the streets and on rooftops. Journalists are not allowed to travel to the Tibet Autonomous Region without permission, and the Chinese government has yet to grant a longstanding request by The New York Times to visit the area. The Deqin area lies in Yunnan Province, right outside the Tibet Autonomous Region.The government’s actions and fierce criticisms of the Dalai Lama do little to change Tibetan attitudes toward their revered leader, whom they would like to see return to his homeland. In this remote area, pilgrims flocking to the sacred snow mountain of Kawa Karpo carry photos of the Dalai Lama. Farther south, in a sprawling monastery outside the town that Tibetans call Gyalthang, known to the Chinese as Shangri-La, a monk’s eyes lighted up when he learned a visitor was from the United States.“Have you seen the Dalai Lama?” he asked.'"

This year, the league has 50 professional teams, each specializing in one of five multiplayer games, including Halo 3 and Call of Duty 4. The teams compete in six tournaments throughout the year (amateurs can play at some), and a typical tournament draws 12,000 to 15,000 spectators over three days, according to the league.Fans can watch the competitions online at MLGPro.com. They can also track each team’s performance at M.L.G.’s sister site, GameBattles.com, which has 2.5 million registered users.Brands like Dr Pepper, Stride gum, Old Spice and Panasonic have signed on as league sponsors, which means they have signs and booths at events, promotion on the league’s Web site and permission to use its logos in their marketing.“The successful marketing of major stars is what sports leagues have always been about,” said Matthew Bromberg, the chief executive of Major League Gaming. “What’s really going on here is for tens of millions of young men, the aspiration to be a pro gamer is the new dream of sports stardom,” he said.The Dr Pepper label promotion is the biggest retail program for the league, Mr. Bromberg said.The promotion lets consumers enter bottle-cap codes online to win points in tournaments and chances to win prizes like T-shirts and televisions. The labels featuring Mr. Taylor will appear on regular and diet 20-ounce bottles.About 80 percent of the total number of Dr Pepper bottles on sale during the promotion will feature the special labels, Ms. Hockens said.Dr Pepper has had other label promotions, including one for “Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull” this year, and has run regional sports-themed promotions, like one for the Dallas Cowboys. However, this is the first sports promotion with national distribution.Dr Pepper began its league sponsorship this year. “Initially, we were looking for a new way to reach our target audience, and we knew that gaming as a genre was extremely important to our target audience,” said Richard Lyons, the manager of the interactive team at Dr Pepper.League executives suggested that Dr Pepper sponsor not only the organization but also a team, and Dr Pepper marketers liked the four members of the team Str8 Rippin, including Mr. Taylor.“They really are rock stars in their own little world,” Mr. Lyons said.Interestingly, the league itself does very little promotion: no online ads, no television ads, no print ads.Still, said Billy Pidgeon, a games industry analyst for the market research firm IDC, the group “has the highest visibility” of any online gaming league in the United States. Competitors include the World Cyber Games, with sponsors including Samsung and Xbox 360, and the Electronic Sports League.'"
"'08-11-19,'0','Almost unnoticed in the election results was some very good news for the environment — and for land preservation in particular. Despite the financial crisis, voters made it clear that they want to increase spending on preserving open land, even at the cost of higher taxes.Across the nation, voters approved $7.3 billion in new spending for parks and open-space preservation. Sixty-two of the 87 referendums to acquire or otherwise protect open space were approved. And the support came in rural, Republican areas, as well as in those that lean toward the Democrats.California and Florida said yes to more than $700 million in new spending on open space. In Minnesota, voters increased the sales tax by three-eights of a cent to generate $5.5 billion over the next 25 years for land preservation and environmental protection. It was the largest open-space state referendum in the nation’s history.Despite especially tough economic times, New Jersey voters showed that they feel strongly about acquiring open space before it is all eaten up by strip malls and McMansions. The state is reeling from high property taxes, unemployment and a budget deficit. But voters still approved 14 of 22 county and municipal referendums to increase or extend property taxes dedicated to acquiring or preserving open space.These votes are an explicit rebuke to President Bush, who failed miserably to honor his 2000 campaign promise to fully fund the Land and Water Conservation Fund, the government’s main vehicle for buying open space. They should give Congress a strong push to approve a public lands measure that, among other things, would grant permanent wilderness protection to two million acres of public land.We had hoped that Congress would approve the legislation in the current lame-duck session. On Monday, the Senate majority leader, Harry Reid, withdrew it from the calendar after Senator Tom Coburn, an Oklahoma Republican, threatened to filibuster the bill. Mr. Coburn called it a waste of money and an unnecessary expansion of federal control over public lands.Mr. Reid said the Senate needed to focus on the economic crisis, but he promised to bring the measure up for immediate action early next year.'"
"'08-11-19,'0','But then Obama surprised Bill and Hillary by offering her a chance at the secretary of state job. Maybe because the Clintonian perspective on anyone who opposes them tends to be paranoid, the couple wasn’t expecting such a magnanimous move and they were pleased to be drawn back in from the margins.“This,” said one who knows Bill, “allows him not to be angry.”At least Bill has the satisfaction of seeing that he has roiled the previously serene and joyous Obamaland. It may be Obama’s very willingness to take the albatross of Bill from around Hillary’s neck and sling it around his own that impresses Bill. Obama is overlooking all his cherished dictums against drama and leaking and his lofty vetting standards to try and create a situation where the country can benefit from the talent of the Clintons while curbing their cheesy excesses, like their endless cash flow from foreigners.And in turn, Bill is doing all he can — he’s disclosing sketchy donors and business interests and figuring out how he could curb his global gallivanting to have fewer conflicts of interest — to help his wife get the job.It says it all that, at the moment became obsessed with news that Hillary was a contender for State, Bill was getting a half-million for an hour’s worth of chat sponsored by the National Bank of , delivered from behind a podium with a camel and Arabic lettering on it. Last year, Bill made $10.1 million in speaking fees.If Hillary gets to be the Mistress of Foggy Bottom, Bill’s guilt over his primary tirades, which hindered her chances of becoming president, would be alleviated.But 42 will probably always be somewhat steamed at 44. Not only because of the Obama camp calling him out on his racially coded poison darts in . Bill is surely jealous that his Democratic successor got a majority of the popular vote with 53 percent; he always was fixated on the idea that, because was a pull on the vote and Bill only got 43 percent, he did not have a mandate, and he thought that emboldened and the Republicans to start investigating him.After 9/11, Bill wistfully said that he wished he could have been a president during an epic global crisis. And, seeing Obama pictured on the cover of Time as the new F.D.R., he will certainly fret that the younger pol will eclipse the Clinton era, which devolved into small-bore issues and the inane impeachment battle.Some critics say Hillary doesn’t have the foreign-policy chops for the job. But she would stop the pompous from getting it, and that is a formidable recommendation. (You know he just wants to swan around in those striped pants.)One person who famously opposed Hillary’s presidential bid thinks she’d make a great secretary of state.“She’s smart and tough, a lot better than any of the old hacks like Holbrooke, Albright, etc.,” says . “Barack Obama is going to run policy, and Hillary will be an effective communicator. It also takes Bill out of the game. It completely turns him into an ally — and probably a help to both of them. I think Obama is very smart to get as many smart people into the room as he can, to bring in Rahm and keep Lieberman and get Hillary into the cabinet. It brings an enormous amount of good will his way, and he’s going to need every ounce of it, given the wars and financial catastrophe America is facing. It’s getting bleaker every day. There are many, many, many more bubbles to burst.”But why support Hillary for Madam Secretary if you don’t support her for Madam President?“I don’t think they’re the same job at all, do you?” he replied.'"
"'08-11-19,'0','But ever since the archbishop of Canterbury, the Most Rev. Rowan Williams, called in February for aspects of Islamic Shariah to be embraced alongside the traditional legal system, the government has been grappling with a public furor over the issue, assuaging critics while trying to reassure a wary and at times disaffected Muslim population that its traditions have a place in British society.Boxed between the two, the government has taken a stance both cautious and confusing, a sign of how volatile almost any discussion of the role of Britain’s nearly two million Muslims can become.“There is nothing whatever in English law that prevents people abiding by Shariah principles if they wish to, provided they do not come into conflict with English law,” the justice minister, Jack Straw, said last month. But he added that British law would “always remain supreme,” and that “regardless of religious belief, we are all equal before the law.”Conservatives and liberals alike — many of them unaware that the Islamic courts had been functioning at all, much less for years — have repeatedly denounced the courts as poor substitutes for British jurisprudence.They argue that the Islamic tribunals’ proceedings are secretive, with no accountability and no standards for judges’ training or decisions.Critics also point to cases of domestic violence in which Islamic scholars have tried to keep marriages together by ordering husbands to take classes in anger management, leaving the wives so intimidated that they have withdrawn their complaints from the police.“They’re hostages to fortune,” said Parvin Ali, founding director of the Fatima Women’s Network, a women’s help group based in Leicester. Speaking of the courts, she said, “There is no outside monitoring, no protection, no records kept, no guarantee that justice will prevail.”But as the uproar continues, the popularity of the courts among Muslims has blossomed.Some of the informal councils, as the courts are known, have been giving advice and handing down judgments to Muslims for more than two decades.Yet the councils have expanded significantly in number and prominence in recent years, with some Islamic scholars reporting a 50 percent increase in cases since 2005.Almost all of the cases involve women asking for divorce, and through word of mouth and an ambitious use of the Internet, courts like the small, unadorned building in London where the father stepped in to plead his daughter’s case have become magnets for Muslim women seeking to escape loveless marriages — not only from Britain but sometimes also from Denmark, Ireland, the Netherlands and Germany.Other cases involve disputes over property, labor, inheritances and physical injury. The tribunals stay away from criminal cases that might call for the imposition of punishments like lashing or stoning.Indeed, most of the courts’ judgments have no standing under British civil law. But for the parties who come before them, the courts offer something more important: the imprimatur of God.“We do not want to give the impression that Muslims are an isolated community seeking a separate legal system in this country,” said Shahid Raza, who adjudicates disputes from an Islamic center in the West London suburb of Ealing.“We are not asking for criminal Shariah law — chopping of hands or stoning to death,” he continued. “Ninety-nine percent of our cases are divorce cases in which women are seeking relief. We are helping women. We are doing a service.”Still, there is ample room for clashes with British custom. Three months ago, for example, a wealthy Bangladeshi family asked Dr. Raza’s council to resolve an inheritance dispute. It was resolved according to Shariah, he said. That meant the male heirs received twice as much as the female heirs.Courts in the United States have endorsed Islamic and other religious tribunals, as in 2003, when a Texas appeals court referred a divorce case to a local council called the Texas Islamic Court.But Shariah has been rejected in the West as well.The Canadian province of Ontario had allowed rabbinical courts and Christian courts to resolve some civil and family disputes with binding rulings under a 1991 law. But when the Islamic Institute on Civil Justice there tried to create a Shariah court, it was attacked as a violation of the rights of Muslim women.As a result, Ontario changed the entire system in 2006 to strip the rulings of any religious arbitration of legal validity or enforceability.In Britain, beth din courts do not decide whether a Jewish couple’s marriage should end. They simply put their stamp of approval on the dissolution of the marriage when both parties agree to it. The beth din also adheres to the rules of Britain’s 1996 Arbitration Act and can function as an official court of arbitration in the consensual resolution of other civil disputes, like inheritance or business conflicts.“People often come to us for reasons of speed, cost and secrecy,” said David Frei, registrar of the London Beth Din. “There’s nothing to prevent Muslims from doing the same thing.”In Britain’s Islamic councils, however, if a wife wants a divorce and the husband does not, the Shariah court can grant her unilateral request to dissolve the marriage.Most Shariah councils do not recognize the Arbitration Act, although Mr. Straw has been pushing them in recent months to do so. The main reason for their opposition is that they do not want the state involved in what they consider to be matters of religion.The conflict over British Shariah courts comes at a time when Islamic principles are being extended to other areas of daily life in Britain.There are now five wholly Islamic banks in the country and a score more that comply with Shariah.An insurance company last summer began British advertising for “car insurance that’s right for your faith” because it does not violate certain Islamic prohibitions, like the one against gambling.Britain’s first Shariah-compliant prepaid MasterCard was begun in August.Here in London, Suhaib Hasan’s “courtroom” is a sparsely furnished office of the Islamic Shariah Council in Leyton, a working-class neighborhood in the eastern corner of the city. It has no lawyers or court stenographer, no recording device or computer, so Dr. Hasan takes partial notes in longhand.“Please, will you give him another chance?” he asked the woman in black who was seeking divorce — that is, before she brought in the weighty voice of her father.“No, no!” the woman, a 24-year-old employment consultant who had come seeking justice from 200 miles away, replied. “I gave him too many chances. He is an evil, evil man.”“I’ll give you one month’s time to try to reconcile,” Dr. Hasan ruled.Then her father tipped the scales.“He was not a cucumber that we could cut open to know that he was rotten inside,” the father testified. “The only solution is divorce.”Apparently convinced, Dr. Hasan said he would recommend divorce at the London Central Mosque, where he and several other religious scholars meet once a month to give final approval to cases like this.Dr. Hasan, a silver-bearded, Saudi-educated scholar of Pakistani origin, handles the Pakistani community; an Egyptian ministers to the ethnic Arab community, while a Bangladeshi and a Somali work with their own communities.The council in Leyton is one of the oldest and largest courts in the country. It has been quietly resolving disputes since 1982 and has dealt with more than 7,000 divorce cases.Under some interpretations of Islamic law, a woman needs the blessing of a scholar of Islamic jurisprudence to be divorced, while a man can simply say three times that he is divorcing his wife.Dr. Hasan counsels women that they must have their civil marriages dissolved in the British civil system.“We always try to keep the marriages together, especially when there are children,” said Dr. Hasan’s wife, Shakila Qurashi, who works as an unofficial counselor for women.If the husband beats her, she should go to the police and have a divorce, Ms. Qurashi said. “But if he’s slapped her only once or something like that,” she said, “and he admits he has made a mistake and promised not to do it again, then we say, ‘You have to forgive.’ ”One recent afternoon, the waiting room was full of women and their family members.A Pakistan-born 33-year-old mother of five explained that her husband would beat her and her children. “He threatens to kill us,” she said, as her daughter translated from Urdu. “He calls me a Jew and an infidel.” Dr. Hasan told her to immediately get police protection and request an Islamic divorce.Another woman, 25, wanted out of a two-year-old arranged marriage with a man who refused to consummate the relationship. Dr. Hasan counseled dialogue.“Until we see the husband,” he said, “we can’t be sure that what you’re saying is true.”'"
"'08-11-19,'0','The most potent way to reduce that toll is to replace some portland cement with recycled material. Coal ash from power plants and blast-furnace slag are the easiest substitutes to find — and they tend to make concrete more valuable than portland cement alone.As often occurs with building techniques, the federal government gave this practice an early proving ground. It commissioned Mr. Christ’s firm, Morphosis, based in Santa Monica, Calif., and headed by Thom Mayne, the Pritzker Architecture Prize winner, to design the San Francisco Federal Building in 2001.“We proposed a 50 percent slag replacement, where 15 percent was common,” said Mr. Christ of the building, which was completed in 2007, surprising critics and passers-by with an array of bends and overhangs. Previously, use of such a high percentage of slag in the United States had mainly been limited to relatively small projects without sophisticated specifications.The process was also gaining credibility on the East Coast around the same time. The green-minded Durst Organization opened Four Times Square, the Condé Nast Building, in 1999 as a showcase for environmentally responsible techniques, recalled the company’s co-president, Jody Durst.To that end, the developer specified using coal ash in the building’s columns. The company wanted to use as much recycled material as it could, Mr. Durst recalled, but the skeptical contractors limited its use to columns rather than floors.The material held up so well there, however, that Durst also used slag for the Helena, a 600-unit apartment tower on West 57th Street in Manhattan, which opened in 2005.By the end of that project, Mr. Durst said, contractors had come around. “I think we paid a premium, but by the end of the job the contractor said he liked the way it handled,” Mr. Durst recalled. “The strength properties were superior.” The developer’s standard procedure now includes ordering slag or coal ash for concrete.The two byproducts differ in availability and characteristics. Slag, which is left over in blast furnaces when steel is made, can make up more of the concrete mix than ash without requiring extra chemicals, but it is harder to obtain locally. (Developers like to buy supplies locally to reduce travel times and to gain points in the LEED rating system, which certifies a building’s environmental friendliness.) Slag also tends to have a lighter color than ash. Ash’s quality can vary more, but testing techniques now generally make it as reliable as slag.Either material makes concrete stronger, explained Christian Meyer, a civil engineering professor at Columbia, by reducing the effect of heat on the integrity of the concrete. Portland cement requires more water, and the resulting concrete may become hotter in warm weather and be more susceptible to cracking. It is also more likely to harden in a mixing truck while a driver sits in traffic on a hot day, making it impossible to pour at the construction site, said Bob Mannino of Pinnacle Construction.Compared with portland cement, slag is denser and is up to 15 percent stronger, said Dave Weber, executive director of the Slag Cement Association. “In mass concrete, for the base of a building, it can comprise up to 80 percent of the mix.”The stronger concrete helps developers meet big-city building codes, which now require higher strength to withstand potential terrorist attacks or disasters. The Freedom Tower at ground zero and a nearby Forest City Ratner condominium, Beekman Tower, are among prominent developments using recycled material.The greater solidity also lets developers make thinner walls, allowing for more rentable square feet, according to the architect John Cetra. Mr. Cetra’s firm, Cetra/Ruddy, decided to use slag in a condominium building called One Madison Park, which is nearing completion on 23rd Street. Like Mr. Durst, he expects to use slag or ash in all urban projects from now on.“It doesn’t add anything to the cost,” Mr. Cetra said. “And it’s used more and more in high-performance concrete, which we like using because it means the structure can be slimmed down a bit so we can conserve space.”As more developers are recognizing the materials’ versatility, supply networks reaching from smelters and coal-fired power plants to concrete makers have been growing. “Most electric utilities have an agreement with a marketer for storage in domes or silos, and on a daily basis trucks will come get it because the power plant needs to clear out the ash,” said Dave Goss, executive director of the American Coal Ash Association.Utilities own ash and sell it to concrete mixing companies. Big concrete companies like France’s Lafarge and independent specialists also own and manage stocks of ash and slag, said Mr. Goss. There are several ways that such companies agree to sell, store and share profits from the material.Growing demand for the recycled material has caused it to become costlier. With America’s relatively few steel mills oversubscribed, said Professor Meyer, some contractors are importing slag from Italy for their projects.Mr. Weber of the Slag Cement Association said trade groups and academics are working on developing “ternary blends” that mix slag, ash and other materials for lower transport and processing costs.More research into concrete’s environmental cost will probably change the industry further in the next 10 years. Even if ash or slag cement become universal, concrete will exact a big toll on the environment, said Professor Meyer, because up to three-quarters of it is aggregated sand or stone, which consumes lots of energy in production. Finding recycled material for aggregate will be the industry’s next challenge.The most promising contender, Professor Meyer said, is construction debris. At Denver International Airport, which opened in 1995, roadbeds contain concrete from the former Stapleton Airport, he said. So, depending on research into the strength of debris and its chemical reaction with other ingredients, concrete — a 2,000-year-old material — may soon involve recycling buildings that have been around for only a few decades.'"
"'08-11-19,'0','Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. says the Treasury’s programs “to restore our financial institutions, financial markets and the flow of lending and credit will determine, to a large extent, the speed and trajectory of our economic recovery.” Pray that he is mistaken.Shoring up lenders, unclogging lending or even stopping foreclosures and the slide in house prices will not alone reverse the spiraling cutbacks in spending, production, jobs and incomes. Only large-scale federal fiscal actions that will reliably boost spending on output — buying of goods and services — will do that.The longer we wait to take such action, the deeper the recession will be, and the greater the economic and human damage. All the risk is on the downside.Allowing political convenience, or ill-timed anxiety about deficits, to delay such action until after the Obama administration takes office would be a reckless gamble. Francis M. BatorThe writer is professor emeritus of political economy at the Harvard Kennedy School of Government.In his defense of government salvage strategies, Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. more than once uses the word “unpredictable” to describe our recent economic maladies. Yet it seems that the fiscal predicament we now face was not only predictable but also inevitable.If the financial experts had bothered to look up from their statistical analyses, they would have seen the problems that were right under their now out-of-joint noses. Granting oversized mortgages to people with no realistic chance of repayment; letting personal credit card debt balloon for people with no realistic path to liquidity; allowing brokerage firms and their well-compensated brethren to operate with little or no oversight — what part of this irresponsible behavior was hidden from view?Mr. Paulson is seeking absolution for his after-the-fact actions, while sidestepping the issue of pre-crisis culpability. Ignorance of the obvious is never a viable strategy, no less a vindication. Our current economic woes were as predictable as Mr. Paulson’s attempt to claim otherwise. Dennis B. AppletonHenry M. Paulson Jr. states that the housing market is at the root of our economic difficulties. Isn’t the logical fix to let the housing market correct itself? Why shouldn’t banks and homeowners pay the price for their bad investments?I had been planning to buy a home for four years, but decided that the housing market was overvalued. I kept hearing “the bubble has to burst” and “just wait, the correction is coming” and even “you dodged that bullet.” Today, my down payment, which was diversely invested in the stock market, is “poof,” and I have no house.So why keep houses out of reach for first-time home buyers? Aren’t we the driving economic force behind pursuing the American Dream?Like the banks, the homeowners and the auto industry, I, Mr. No Homeowner, am also in line. Where’s my bailout?The group appointed by President Bush to handle the $700 billion bailout is, as I feared, squandering our money. Some $250 billion has been allocated. Let’s see the canceled checks, let’s follow the money!Let’s post on the Internet the details of all permutations of this money. How exactly is this money being used? Surely we as the bankers should know where the money is going.If you borrow money from a bank, the bankers want to know how you’ll spend it. The bank won’t lend you money for a house and stand by while you use that money to buy a car. Shouldn’t we do the same and track every dime?'"

"'08-11-19,'0','And if a corporate bankruptcy does not offer a path to reorganization, many of the jobs at struggling companies may vanish for good. That suggests a long and painful economic downturn.“It just further amplifies the recessionary spiral,” said Stephen F. Cooper, a restructuring expert who is advising companies trying to stay out of bankruptcy. “It will certainly have an impact on the employment — or unemployment — outlook and it will certainly have an impact on consumer spending.”Bankruptcy protection is supposed to give a company a breather, blocking creditors while workout specialists, lawyers and managers try to figure out how to return it to profitability. In court, the bankrupt company can renegotiate loan payments and modify contracts.Lenders to a company trying to reorganize under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code decide whether they want to bet on the company’s success once it emerges from court oversight, by offering new loans or converting their existing loans into equity. If the company emerges, there is a chance it will repay investors.“Many companies in Chapter 11 are teetering between whether they are able to move forward with their reorganization or shut down because they can’t find additional funds,” said Mark D. Collins of Richards, Layton & Finger, which represents Linens ’n Things in its bankruptcy case.In past, less severe downturns, Mr. Collins said, more companies faced the relatively simple problem of owing too much money. Lenders, creditors and the company’s management could work out a palatable plan, then file for bankruptcy protection and use the legal proceeding to wipe away some of the company’s debt. That is known as a “prepackaged” bankruptcy.“But it doesn’t really work when you’ve got a much more difficult situation, where it’s a very challenging industry or when the company needs a lot of restructuring beyond just its balance sheet, such as eliminating or selling off unprofitable lines of business,” Mr. Collins said.Reorganizing a company under those circumstances requires an investment in the company’s future, but investors now are not optimistic enough to make such bets, he continued. “People are hesitant to do a lot of significant transactions.”Deterred by lack of credit and, in some cases, wagering on the possibility of a government bailout, corporate executives have chosen to avoid bankruptcy and delay changes that might keep businesses going, which can block a successful reorganization, said Lynn LoPucki, a law professor visiting at Harvard.“You have a whole country full of companies and people in financial distress, all of them trying to delay dealing with their problems, all waiting to see what the government is going to do,” Mr. LoPucki said. “And that in itself may be the financial crisis.”The pace of filing for bankruptcy protection has recently begun to pick up, but filings typically trail an economic downturn and so far the number is nowhere near levels in previous downturns. The number of corporate bankruptcies rose last year to 28,322, but that is the second-lowest number of filings since 1980, according to the American Bankruptcy Institute.And many of the recent filings, lawyers say, are not efforts to reorganize at all.“True reorganizations, in the spirit of the bankruptcy code, are becoming extremely rare,” said Sandra E. Mayerson, a lawyer at Holland & Knight in New York. Instead, she said, many companies file for bankruptcy protection and proceed immediately to liquidation.Part of the problem is that in recent years, large lenders to corporations have been hedge funds, private equity investors or other institutions. Even if these lenders wanted to extend a loan to a struggling company, they might not be able to do so because they need cash quickly, from the sale of whatever assets a bankrupt company has, to satisfy their own nervous shareholders, Ms. Mayerson said.“Some of them don’t have it to give, their funds might be tapped out,” Ms. Mayerson said. “Some may choose not to put good money in after bad.”Even if creditors give a struggling company more rope, they are not patient about it, and tight repayment deadlines leave scant time to turn a big company around. Shutting down a company can be done more quickly.“A number of years ago, we had fairly long bankruptcies, where companies could come out as stand-alone enterprises,” said Joe Bondi, a managing director of Alvarez & Marsal, a turnaround and restructuring firm. Now, no one wants to hold the debt of companies whose prospects are in doubt.“They want to get paid off,” he said, whatever amount is possible. “People are concerned that we are in a very long-term economic doldrum.”The prospect of liquidation of enormous companies, like Detroit’s Big Three, is frightening; the collapse of one would wipe out tens of thousands of jobs. But the absence of credit poses a practical obstacle to their reorganization through bankruptcy proceedings: Who wants to extend a loan to companies with such shaky prospects?One solution, Mr. LoPucki said, would be for the federal government to extend loans to an automaker after it filed for bankruptcy protection. In that way, under bankruptcy law the government would be first in line to be repaid, before other creditors. And vendors might be more willing to work with a company backed by a loan made or guaranteed by the government, he said.“Otherwise, you’re just giving money to the creditors,” Mr. LoPucki said, because outside of bankruptcy proceedings, bailout funds given to the company could be paid out immediately to suppliers and other creditors. “You want to get ahead of other creditors. And you want to maintain jobs.”'"

Several reports said Fox would not offer more than $100 million a year while ESPN agreed to pay $125 million for television, radio, digital, international and marketing rights. Digital rights include the operation of the official B.C.S. Web site, and the simulcasting of games online and for mobile devices.Neither officials with the B.C.S. nor ESPN would confirm the terms of their agreement.ESPN’s president, George Bodenheimer, said the network planned to keep all of the games on ESPN and not broadcast any on ABC, but would not charge cable providers a premium. ESPN is available to about 98 million homes on an extended basic-cable tier. Disney owns ESPN and ABC.Fox was paying $82.5 million a year for the current four-year deal to broadcast the Fiesta, Orange and Sugar Bowls, as well as the B.C.S. championship game. The new deal covers the Fiesta, Orange and Sugar Bowls from 2011 to 2014 and the championship game from 2011 to 2013.

But the better news about “The World Is What It Is” is this: it’s one of the sprightliest, most gripping, most intellectually curious and, well, funniest biographies of a living writer (Mr. Naipaul is 76) to come along in years.Mr. French is a relative rarity among biographers, a real writer, and at his best he sounds like a combination of that wily bohemian Geoff Dyer and that wittily matter-of-factual cyborg Michael Kinsley.Even the cameos in Mr. French’s biography are crazily vivid. Here is his hole-in-one description of the editor Francis Wyndham: “Popular, gentle, solitary and eccentric, Wyndham lived with his mother, wore heavy glasses and high-waisted trousers, gave off random murmurs and squeaks and moved with an amphibian gait.”It is to Mr. Naipaul’s credit that this crafty and inquisitive book exists. “He believed that a less than candid biography would be pointless,” Mr. French writes, “and his willingness to allow such a book to be published in his lifetime was at once an act of narcissism and humility.”Mr. Naipaul gave Mr. French access to his archives , including journals of his first wife that he’d not yet read. Mr. Naipaul was allowed to examine the completed manuscript but requested no changes.Mr. French indicates, early on, that he is not playing softball. On his book’s second page we read that Mr. Naipaul “said, or was said to have said, that Africa had no future, Islam was a calamity, France was fraudulent, and interviewers were monkeys. If Zadie Smith of ‘White Teeth’ fame — optimistic and presentable — was a white liberal’s dream, V. S. Naipaul was the nightmare. Rather than celebrate multiculturalism, he denounced it as ‘multi-culti,’ made malign jokes about people with darker skin than himself, blamed formerly oppressed nations for their continuing failure.”“For a successful immigrant writer to take such a position,” Mr. French continues, “was seen as a special kind of treason.”But Mr. French quickly and adroitly steps back to give us a wide-angled and morally complicated view of how Mr. Naipaul, knighted in 1990 and named a Nobel laureate in 2001, made his way in the world, how his greatest books were conceived and composed, how he became what he became: genius, loner, sexual obsessive, ogre, snob, provocateur and profoundly influential and controversial thinker on subjects like colonialism and belief and unbelief.Born into an Indian family in Trinidad in 1932, Vidiadhar Surajprasad Naipaul was raised in relative poverty. His hapless father, a sign painter and occasional journalist, was the inspiration for what may be Mr. Naipaul’s signal work of fiction, “A House for Mr. Biswas” (1961). Mr. Naipaul’s more animated mother, Mr. French suggests, inspired his literary voice: “bright, certain, robust, slightly mocking.”A scholarship took Mr. Naipaul, at 18, to University College, Oxford, and he has lived in England ever since. When Mr. Naipaul’s first novel, “The Mystic Masseur,” was published in 1957, Mr. French notes, in typically vivid prose: “Like a tiger cub bringing home his first kill, he copied out extracts for his mother from the reviews.”Mr. Naipaul’s dealings with women make up a good part of “The World Is What It Is.” You will often wish to cover your eyes. After a fumbling sexual encounter that reads like an outtake from Ian McEwan’s “On Chesil Beach,” Mr. Naipaul proposed to Patricia Hale, an aspiring young actress. They would remain married until her death in 1996, but it was often a twisted, withered, tenuous relationship. Mr. Naipaul criticized her remorselessly and regularly visited prostitutes; he also carried on a decades-long affair with a younger woman, Margaret Murray, whom he sometimes violently beat. For her part, Ms. Murray liked to entertain Mr. Naipaul by mailing him life-size drawings “of his erect penis, done in dark brown felt-tip; the penis wore sunglasses and a lime green cowboy hat.”Though Patricia Naipaul frequently came along with her husband when he researched his travel books, she is rarely mentioned in them; she floated behind, a kind of ghost in his life. Later, when she was dying of breast cancer, he was angry she did not perish quickly enough. He wished to marry his current wife, Nadira.Mr. French writes with wit and feeling about Mr. Naipaul’s books, and about Mr. Naipaul’s sense of his career. He was grimly determined not to be seen as merely a West Indian writer. “Like Ralph Ellison after the publication of ‘Invisible Man,’ he maintained that he was in a category all of his own.”Mr. Naipaul was capable of racism. And his success sometimes brought it out in others. Evelyn Waugh, in a 1963 letter to Nancy Mitford, noted that Mr. Naipaul had won yet another literary prize: “Oh for a black face,” he wrote.Mr. French details the off-and-on animosity between Mr. Naipaul and the Caribbean poet and fellow Nobelist Derek Walcott. Would people still praise Mr. Naipaul’s “nasty little sneers” against black people, Mr. Walcott has asked, if those sneers were turned on Jews?The final sections of Mr. French’s biography grow a bit deflated and sad; the book becomes a list of awards and obligations, and a compendium of Mr. Naipaul’s boorish behavior. (He dressed down Iris Murdoch while both were dining with Margaret Thatcher at 10 Downing Street; he soured an evening at Francis Ford Coppola’s Napa Valley estate by disapproving of the food and by sneering at George Lucas: “I don’t know ‘Star Wars,’ I am not interested in films.”)“A writer is in the end not his books, but his myth,” Mr. Naipaul has written. “And that myth is in the keeping of others.” Mr. Naipaul was brave to allow this complicated parsing of his own myth into the world. You will finish “The World Is What It Is” wishing to reread Mr. Naipaul’s best books immediately. You will also be glad he is not your friend, neighbor, sibling, landlord or barista.But what of it? Bad people write good books. And as Mr. Naipaul pointedly says here, “I remain completely indifferent to how people think of me.”'"
"'08-11-19,'0','“They’re asking the questions but they haven’t said anything yet” on how aid might be structured, said Frank Zhao, vice president and chief technology officer of Geely Automobile Holdings. “We really hope the Chinese government will come and help us.”Michael Dunne, the managing director for China at J. D. Power, said in a telephone interview from Shanghai that the executives’ remarks here represented a shift in the position of the Chinese auto industry.“This is the first I’ve heard of it,” he said, adding that “as the market slows down, Chinese automakers are going to face competition as they never have before.”Lots across China became increasingly crowded with unsold cars as sales were slightly lower in August and September than a year earlier. Yet manufacturers unexpectedly increased their shipments of new vehicles to dealerships last month by 10 percent compared with a year earlier, seeking to keep new factories busy and avoid layoffs.Retail sales figures for October are due this week, and are likely to show a further decline that could set off another round of price cuts in a market where discounting is already becoming increasingly common.Detroit has repeatedly found that raising production in the face of weak retail sales is a recipe for financial trouble, and there is little reason to think that will be different in China.The Chinese auto industry faces several threats simultaneously. Weakening economic growth, falling real estate prices and a yearlong plunge in the stock market have made consumers leery of spending money. Fuel prices in China are still high despite the recent decline in world oil prices. And Chinese auto exports, mostly to developing countries in Eastern Europe, Southeast Asia, Africa and Latin America, are starting to crumble.China’s car industry is already bigger than Japan’s, and is approaching in sales the industries of the United States and all of Europe. China is on track to sell 10 million vehicles this year, while demand in the United States is dropping toward 14 million vehicles.Automobiles have played a central role in Beijing’s recent plans to move up the manufacturing chain, from making cheap goods that require unskilled or low-skilled workers to more advanced products.To that end, the Chinese government has provided considerable help to China’s nascent auto industry with research and development spending, as well as loans from state-owned banks.But there is some disagreement within the Chinese auto industry now about how the government can be most helpful.Some companies, like Geely, are looking for more government grants to help them develop hybrid gasoline-electric cars and other cutting-edge technologies for which research spending may be cut if sales do not recover.But Zheng Qinghong, the general manager of Guangzhou Auto, one of China’s largest and fastest-growing automakers, said that the Chinese industry needs the government to help consumers become enthusiastic again about buying cars. Retail sales have dipped a couple percentage points to 750,000 a month; sales were still rising at an annual pace of 24 percent a year ago. “The best way is to boost growth in demand” for cars, through steps like lower car taxes and lower fuel prices, he said in an interview.Western multinationals would probably benefit at least indirectly from any government initiative to help China’s auto industry, because Western companies are required to do business through joint ventures with Chinese automakers, most of which are partly or entirely government owned.Jeffrey Shen, the chief executive and president of one of these joint ventures, the Changan Ford Mazda Automobile Company, said that he did not know how the government would help, but that some steps were inevitable. “I’m sure it will come,” he said, with both extra assistance for research and greater availability of loans.The renewed willingness of state-owned banks to lend money to the auto industry this autumn is in contrast with the United States, where General Motors, Ford and Chrysler have found banks and other investors leery of lending to them.Government-mandated lending quotas, not interest rates, tend to be the most important limit on bank lending in China. Regulators have begun easing the quotas this fall after four years of fairly tight quotas imposed in an effort to control the growth of the money supply and limit inflation.Direct loans from the government of the sort under discussion in Washington are not needed in China, Mr. Zheng said. “For now, the Chinese auto industry doesn’t need saving” in the same way as the American industry, he said.Chinese automakers began facing real difficulties only in the third quarter, and have not yet released results for that period; many release their results only twice a year.Gas prices have not fallen in China because the government pushed up regulated retail gasoline and diesel prices at service stations to more than $3 a gallon over the last year, but has not lowered retail prices as oil prices have plunged.The government is trying to encourage energy conservation and allow oil refiners to recover financially from sometimes being forced to sell gasoline and diesel below cost earlier this year during the spike in oil prices.China’s top three export markets for fully assembled vehicles are Russia, Ukraine and Vietnam, all of which are struggling with the global financial crisis.Great Wall Motor has had a 40 percent plunge in its monthly exports to Russia in the last three months, said Steven Wang, the deputy manager of the company’s international trade division. But Great Wall Motor has still managed to avoid any layoffs because domestic sales remain strong enough to maintain employment, Mr. Wang said.With China’s largest automakers involved in joint ventures with American automakers, and with the entire Chinese auto industry now seeking its own forms of government help as well, criticism of any bailout for Detroit has been muted. Producers elsewhere in Asia, facing declining markets at home as well, have also been hesitant to criticize.“We support vigorous competition in the automotive market place and recognize there may be extraordinary situations when such a vital sector of the American economy may require unprecedented actions to assure its long-term viability and a healthy American economy which benefits everyone,” said Jake Jang, a spokesman for Hyundai Motor in South Korea.But managers at some of the smaller Chinese manufacturers, especially those with hopes of entering the American market some day, are unhappy about the prospect of assistance for Detroit from Washington.“If G.M., Ford and Chrysler get a lot of support from their government, it’s not fair,” said Gordon Chen, the international business manager of Changfeng Motor, which has displayed cars at the last two Detroit auto shows in preparation for entering the American market in 2011 or 2012.'"
"'08-11-19,'0','Mr. Maliki also attacked opponents of the pact for suggesting over the past few days that the bargaining had gone on in secret, apparently a response to politicians who said they were surprised by the contents of the agreement.“I feel sad that the opponents or even those who agreed with the pact released statements that are far away from reality,” he said.In a culture deeply imbued with conspiracy, Mr. Maliki repeatedly vowed that there were no secret side agreements to the pact, the text of which was published in local newspapers on Tuesday.Supporters of the agreement, including most Shiite and Kurdish legislators, are in a delicate position. While they say that they have the majority needed to succeed in Parliament, a simple mathematical victory is not enough; all acknowledge the need for widespread support.In a statement released on Tuesday, Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, the most influential Shiite cleric in Iraq, who has advocated national unity consistently since the 2003 invasion, reiterated his insistence that the agreement draw support across sectarian lines.“Any agreement that doesn’t win national consensus,” the statement read, “will not be acceptable and will be a reason for more suffering for Iraqis.” Shiite lawmakers said that the ayatollah told them on Saturday that he found the final draft of the pact satisfactory, if not ideal, but that his condition of national consent must be met.Addressing these concerns, Mr. Maliki argued that “the consensus vote in the cabinet on the withdrawal of the forces represents a unified voice.”The main opposition is coming from followers of the anti-American Shiite cleric, Moktada al-Sadr, who has rejected any agreement with the Americans in principle, and many Sunni politicians, who, while they are open to supporting the deal, are wary of the Shiite-led Iraqi government.Though Sunni lawmakers are aware that Parliament has no ability to make changes to the agreement, they are seeking certain guarantees before giving their approval. These guarantees, they said, could appear in an appendix to the pact or as supplementary legislation.Sunni lawmakers spent the day drawing up a list of demands that they intended to hand over to the Americans and the Iraqi government. Some of the demands are specific, like amnesty for the majority of the 16,000 Sunni detainees in the custody of the Americans. Others are more general, like the concern that Sunni groups will be unfairly singled out as targets by the Iraqi and American security forces.Sunni lawmakers said they had been meeting with Americans, including the ambassador, Ryan C. Crocker, to air their concerns, but added that the Americans had only listened and not responded in any specific way. The Sunnis said that they did want some sort of framework in place after Dec. 31, the expiration date for the United Nations resolution currently governing coalition forces. But they said there could be alternatives to this pact, including an extension of the resolution.However, a senior American official in Baghdad said that the Iraqi government had “formally and categorically rejected” an extension of the resolution.“We want to reach a solution,” Alaa Maki, a senior leader in a Sunni party, the Iraqi Islamic Party, said in an interview at his office on Tuesday. “We don’t want to just put obstacles in front of Iraqi progress. But we want things to be put in the right way, so that we build on the right foundation.“We regard this as the most important issue from 2003 until now,” he added, “because it will put the Iraqi future on paper.”'"

"'08-11-19,'0','The clash took place as Democratic leaders in Congress remained deadlocked with Republicans and President Bush over a $25 billion rescue package for Detroit and a broader $100 billion economic stimulus package.Mr. Bush and Republican lawmakers oppose the measures, and Senate Democrats do not appear to have enough votes to override a filibuster.As a result, Democratic lawmakers increasingly predict that they will have to wait until January, when President-elect Barack Obama takes office and Democrats attain a nearly filibuster-proof majority in the Senate.Since Mr. Bush passed the bailout law six weeks ago, the Treasury has allocated about $250 billion for banks and $40 billion as part of the bailout for the American International Group, the insurance conglomerate.Mr. Paulson acknowledged that he had the authority to use bailout money for homeowners, but he insisted that the money should go toward “investment” in financial institutions rather than “spending” on rescue efforts.“We have seen that capital purchases are clearly powerful in terms of impact for dollar of investment,” he said in his prepared testimony.But Sheila C. Bair, chairwoman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, warned that the country could expect a tidal wave of up to five million foreclosures over the next two years if the government took no additional action.“The stakes are too high and the time is too short to rely on voluntary agreements,” Ms. Bair told lawmakers.Ms. Bair, who has publicly broken ranks with the Bush administration, is proposing that the Treasury use $24.4 billion from the bailout program to help refinance and reduce the mortgage obligations of people who are delinquent on their payments and in danger of losing their homes.Her proposal is based on a program that the F.D.I.C. already put in place for people with loans at IndyMac, the failed California bank that the agency took over this summer.Under her plan, the Treasury would refinance mortgages for people if it is possible to reduce their monthly payments to about 32 percent of their monthly income. To encourage existing mortgage lenders to settle for lower payments, the government would accept responsibility for half of the losses if the homeowner defaults a second time.Democratic leaders have strongly endorsed the idea. “Further delay in implementing these solutions is unacceptable,” said the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi of California. Mr. Obama has called for a mortgage-relief program as well.The other major point on which Mr. Paulson clashed with the lawmakers was the rescue of the car companies.Representative Paul E. Kanjorski, Democrat of Pennsylvania, expressed bewilderment that Mr. Paulson would bail out banks but not carmakers.“Do you consider the loss of an automobile company a systemic risk, or don’t you?” Mr. Kanjorski said.“I think it would be something to be avoided,” Mr. Paulson responded.On the Senate side of Capitol Hill, the chairmen of General Motors, Ford and Chrysler pleaded before the Senate banking committee for a $25 billion rescue package that would come on top of a $25 billion loan program that is aimed at financing the production of energy-efficient vehicles.White House and Treasury officials said that the companies should make do with the loans, which would be made through the Energy Department.Republican lawmakers are opposed to the Democratic efforts, but they gave Mr. Paulson a hard time as well.Representative Spencer Bachus, Republican of Alabama, complained that Mr. Paulson was unclear about his goals and did not have an “exit strategy” for the government. Representative Steven C. LaTourette, Republican of Ohio, lambasted the Treasury secretary for “picking winners and losers” and using the bailout program to force the recent merger between PNC Financial Services and the National City Corporation.Mr. Paulson defended his strategy, but said he hoped to avoid committing any more of the bailout money, from the troubled asset relief program, before Mr. Bush’s term ends in January.“We have learned that this financial crisis is unpredictable and difficult to counteract,” Mr. Paulson said. “We concluded that it was only prudent to reserve our TARP capacity, maintaining not only our flexibility, but that of the next administration.”Ben S. Bernanke, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, testified alongside Mr. Paulson and Ms. Bair. All three officials agreed that the financial and credit crisis was far from over.Mr. Bernanke said there were some signs that the credit markets were improving, but he cautioned that “over all, credit conditions are still far from normal, with risk spreads remaining very elevated and banks reporting that they continued to tighten lending standards.”'"
"'08-11-19,'0','WASHINGTON (AP) — Producer prices plunged a record amount in October as energy prices fell by the largest amount in 22 years.The Labor Department said Tuesday that wholesale prices dropped 2.8 percent in October, the biggest one-month decline on records that go back more than 60 years. The previous record was a 1.6 percent fall in October 2001, the month after the terrorist attacks.The overall decline in the department’s Producer Price Index was bigger than the 1.8 percent drop that analysts had expected. However, core inflation, which excludes energy and food, was not as restrained, rising by a bigger-than-expected 0.4 percent.The 0.4 percent rise in core inflation was attributed partly to special factors and did not alter the view that plunging energy prices and a sharply slowing economy were combining to reduce inflation pressures.The 2.8 percent overall decrease was the third straight month that wholesale prices have fallen.Many economists believe the economy has fallen into a recession that could be the worst downturn in more than two decades. The expectation is that falling inflation pressures will give the Federal Reserve room to cut interest rates further to combat the downturn.'"
"'08-11-19,'0','The technology-heavy Nasdaq posted the lowest gains of the major indexes, adding 1.22 points, or 0.08 percent, to finish at 1,483.27.Equity analysts, searching for signs of a bottom, said that financial markets have tested their yearly lows in recent trading sessions, dropping within reach of new bottoms only to recover by the closing bell. Linda Duessel, an equity strategist at Federated Investors, said Tuesday’s bounce fit that pattern.“That should go down as another successful test,” she said, but added, “We’re not opening any bottles tonight.”Hewlett-Packard led the Dow’s advance after the computer maker posted a preliminary revenue gain of 19 percent during its fiscal fourth quarter, to $33.6 billion, from $28.3 billion during the comparable period last year. The positive report, a rare glimmer amid a litany of lower profits and slumping sales, sent Hewlett’s shares up 14.5 percent, to $33.59 a share.Technology shares, which had fallen about 50 percent since the start of the year, rose on Tuesday. Computer makers including Dell, Sun Microsystems, Intel and Apple finished higher, but Sony fell 1.5 percent.Shares of the home-improvement retailer Home Depot closed 3.6 percent higher at $20.71 after the company reported third-quarter earnings that beat Wall Street expectations. The home-supply chain reported earnings of 45 cents a share, compared with estimates of 38 cents.Still, the company reported that its third-quarter earnings fell 31 percent compared with last year, to $756 million from $1.1 billion. And sales at stores open at least a year, a crucial indicator, had shrunk 8.3 percent since last year.“The housing and home improvement markets remain challenging,” Home Depot’s chief executive, Frank S. Blake, said in a statement. “Across our entire business, we are making the adjustments necessary to respond to a tough market environment.”Yahoo rose 8.7 percent, to $11.55 a share, a day after its chief executive, Jerry Yang, said he would step down. Mr. Yang led the company through a tumultuous time, marked by Microsoft’s failed takeover bid and Yahoo’s sliding share price.And shares in General Motors and the Ford Motor Company closed down as the Big Three automotive executives prepared to ask Congress to bail out the struggling auto industry. Members of the Senate Banking Committee were still delivering their introductory remarks as the markets closed.In a report that drew mixed reaction on Tuesday, the wholesale prices of goods like oil and metals dropped by a record 2.8 percent in October as the economic slump burst this summer’s commodities bubble. The price of energy plunged 12.8 percent from September to October on falling demand for oil, and food costs fell 0.2 percent, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported.Gasoline prices, which hit record highs above $4 a gallon this summer, tumbled 24.9 percent in October. Wholesale natural gas prices fell 13.3 percent, while the price of diesel, which fuels long-range container trucks, dropped 16.4 percent.“It’s beneficial that energy prices are coming down,” said Abiel Reinhart, an economist at JPMorgan. “It puts a lot more real disposable income in people’s pockets. It’s advantageous to the United States and consumers.”And while falling prices make it cheaper to create microprocessors, transport cars or fill up gas tanks, they are also a portent of a rapidly downshifting economy, analysts said.“The price of commodities fell at the greatest rate in over half a century,” Joseph Brusuelas, chief economist of Merk Investments, said. “Will the U.S. consumer continue to retrench and increase savings, or will that good news provide them with a little bit of stimulus?”Crude oil in New York trading settled down 56 cents to $54.39 a barrel.In Europe, the markets reversed early losses and closed higher. The FTSE 100 index in London closed up 1.8 percent. The CAC 40 in Paris rose 1.1 percent, and the DAX in Frankfurt showed a gain of 0.49 percent.Every Asian market fell, as investors in the region caught up with Monday’s drop on Wall Street. In Tokyo, the benchmark Nikkei 225 stock average fell 2.3 percent, while in Hong Kong, the Hang Seng index closed down 5.1 percent. The S&P/ASX 200 index in Sydney lost 3.6 percent.In the United States, the yield on the 10-year note fell to 3.53 percent, from 3.65 percent.'"

"'08-11-20,'0','Dr. Katz said the report did not go far enough. He issued a statement saying that the participants had been “exploited, manipulated and deceived.”A year after the Tuskegee report, Dr. Katz served on a panel of prominent academics who called for a moratorium on the use of poor people as subjects of medical experimentation.Dr. Katz had been hired as a physician by Yale in 1953 and soon became the chief resident of the outpatient clinic at the university’s medical school. He began teaching psychiatry at Yale in 1955 and three years later was appointed to the law school as an assistant professor of psychiatry and law. He retired in 1993, but taught until recently as an emeritus professor.“As a doctor steeped in the law,” Harold Hongju Koh, the dean of the law school, said in a statement, “Jay Katz illuminated better than anyone has before or since the complex of medical, legal and ethical choices that haunt the silent world of doctor and patient.”The sometimes blurred line between medical ethics and the law was a theme of many of Dr. Katz’s books, which include: “The Family and the Law,” written with Joseph Goldstein (1964); “Psychoanalysis, Psychiatry and Law,” with Mr. Goldstein and Mr. Dershowitz, (1967); “Experimentation with Human Beings” (1972); “Catastrophic Diseases: Who Decides What?” written with Alexander M. Capron (1975); and “The Silent World of Doctor and Patient” (1984).Jacob Katz was born on Oct. 20, 1922, in Zwickau, Germany, one of two sons of Paul and Dora Ungar Katz. His father owned a department store. When Jacob was 11, the Nazis came to power and his family’s citizenship was revoked. His father managed to get him a Czech passport. At 16, on his own, Jacob went to Prague, and then, by way of Italy and England, made his way to New York, where he found work in an auto parts store. The rest of Jacob’s family followed in 1940.Four years later, he graduated from the University of Vermont, and in 1949 he received his medical degree from Harvard. He then served as a captain in the Air Force.In 1952, Dr. Katz married Esta Mae Zorn; she died in 1987. Besides his son, he is survived by his second wife, Marilyn Arthur; two daughters, Sally Katz and Amy Goldminz; two stepdaughters, Mary Whitfield and Emily Whitfield; a brother, Norman (his other brother, Joseph, predeceased him); and four grandchildren.If there was one revelation that most focused Dr. Katz on issues of medical ethics throughout his career it was the unspeakable experiments performed by Nazi doctors during World War II.He expressed consternation in 1996 when the Food and Drug Administration revised 50-year-old federal regulations to allow medical researchers to enroll patients in some studies without their consent. Although the new rules could be applied only in carefully circumscribed situations, they stepped back from a principle dating back to the Nuremberg War Crimes trials, when American judges wrote an international code of medical ethics.“It’s a fateful step,” Dr. Katz told The New York Times in a telephone interview from Germany, where at the time he was about to give the keynote speech at a conference in observance of the 50th anniversary of the doctors’ trials at Nuremberg.“The first sentence of the first principle of the Nuremberg Code,” he said, stated that no research on human beings should be done without their consent. And now, he said, “here we are making exceptions.”“The revised rules remain in effect and are very controversial,” the University of Pennsylvania ethicist Arthur L. Caplan, a friend of Dr. Katz, said Wednesday. “We fight about them all the time.”'"
"'08-11-20,'0','Over the years, they say, North Korea has divided its negotiations with the outside world into what analysts call “salami pieces,” maximizing its gains at each stage. If the opponent balks, it uses brinkmanship.“North Korea got what it could from Bush. Now it is signaling to President-elect Barack Obama, ‘O.K., let’s negotiate again over nuclear sampling,’ ” said Lee Sang-hyun, an analyst at Sejong Institute, a research organization. “To Lee Myung-bak, its message is that it means action if he doesn’t reconsider his policy.”To pull off the two tricks together, North Korea is using its old tactic of “tongmi bongnam” — opening the door to the Americans while shutting it to the South Koreans. The idea is to engage the United States while raising tensions with South Korea, with the aim of driving a wedge between allies.North Korea, a master of survival surrounded by bigger powers, has often used this tactic of creating and then exploiting their disputes and may be particularly tempted to use it now that leaders with such different approaches have taken power in Seoul and Washington. Unlike Mr. Lee or President Bush for most of his term, Mr. Obama has emphasized a policy of open and aggressive diplomacy with the world’s so-called rogue states.Eight years ago, North Korea used a similar rift to its advantage, only then the roles of Seoul and Washington were reversed. In 2000, the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-il, embraced South Korea’s president, Kim Dae-jung, who traveled to Pyongyang, the North’s capital, with his sunshine policy. The incoming Bush administration barely hid its contempt. It lumped North Korea into an “axis of evil” and denied it direct dialogue until it first agreed to give up its nuclear weapons program.The friction between Washington and Seoul continued to trouble relations throughout Mr. Bush’s first term, as South Koreans saw Washington as a hindrance to a faster reconciliation with the North. Although hobbled by American-led international sanctions, North Korea succeeded in extracting generous aid from South Korea.In 2006, North Korea changed the dynamics of nuclear talks by conducting its first nuclear test. But with Washington growing more eager to strike a nuclear disarmament deal with the North, South Koreans ended a decade of liberal rule by electing President Lee.Mr. Lee is a conservative who wants to make his mark as a disciplinarian on North Korea. He questioned huge investments promised to the North by his two liberal predecessors, Mr. Kim and Roh Moo-hyun. He vowed not to support any major economic help for the North until there was a breakthrough in dismantling its nuclear facilities. While Washington agreed to ship 500,000 tons of food to North Korea, Mr. Lee said that South Korea would not give food aid unless the North publicly asked for it.North Korea never did, and it never forgave. It called Mr. Lee “despicable human scum,” an epithet it had previously reserved for John R. Bolton, Washington’s hard-line strategist during Mr. Bush’s first term.“Obviously the North Koreans decided that they can sacrifice the sunshine policy and show to everybody in Seoul that they don’t care,” said Andrei Lankov, a North Korea expert at Kookmin University in Seoul. “Meanwhile, we will see spring in the North Korea-U.S. relations.”The North Korean tactic puts Mr. Lee, a self-styled pragmatist, in a difficult position. Abandoning his principled stance will be seen as surrender by his supporters, while staying the course will virtually assure that North Korea shuts down Kaesong, analysts say. That will feed South Korean fears of an unstable peninsula and provide Mr. Lee’s liberal critics with plentiful ammunition.Perhaps the greatest current concern about North Korea’s recent moves, Korea experts say, is what they may signal about the internal dynamics of the regime. “The more intriguing issue is whether all these developments signal a growing role of the military,” said Daniel C. Sneider, associate director for research at Stanford University’s Shorenstein Asia-Pacific Research Center. “And the tour of Kaesong by the military was troubling in that regard.”The military is said to detest Kaesong and its capitalistic influence, as well as any deal that would deprive it of nuclear weapons.Kim Jong-il has been known to let his military speak up when he wants to raise tensions ahead of talks with the Americans. Analysts say it may also signal that North Korea’s priority is shifting from the economic benefits (33,000 North Korean workers in Kaesong earn $60 a month) to internal security amid reports that Mr. Kim suffered a stroke in August.“It is the conservative mood that prevails in Pyongyang now,” said Leonid A. Petrov, a North Korea expert at Australian National University and a frequent visitor to the North Korean capital.With all the speculation over the North’s motives, Mr. Lankov, of Kookmin University, said, one thing seemed clear.“The decision to close Kaesong is a very big decision that no one in North Korea can make without explicit approval from Kim Jong-il,” he said. “It is an indirect confirmation that he is in control.”'"
"'08-11-20,'0','The far-right British National Party said Wednesday that it would take court action after names of more than 12,000 party members were posted on the Internet, along with their home addresses, telephone numbers and, in many cases, occupations. The party is best known for its opposition to nonwhite immigration. The occupations ascribed to party members in the Web posting, which was taken down within 24 hours, included teachers, members of the armed services, a handful of police and prison officers, a doctor, a nurse and a vicar. The party’s leader, Nick Griffin, said the posting of the list was part of a “dirty tricks campaign” by the governing Labor Party. Jacqui Smith, the home secretary in Prime Minister Gordon Brown’s cabinet, denied any Labor involvement.'"
"'08-11-20,'0','This will be the first time since Argentina joined tennis’s premier team competition in 1923 that the country has staged a home event on anything but outdoor clay. The closest it came to winning the finals was in 1981 against John McEnroe and the United States, and in 2006 against Marat Safin and Russia. Both defeats came on the road and indoors.“It seems strange being in my country and seeing a Davis Cup final played on an indoor carpet, but in reality, it reflects the natural evolution of tennis in Argentina,” said Guillermo Salatino, the former Argentine player who, at age 63, remains one of the leading voices of the game here on radio and television.Argentine players have indeed become more complete. Nalbandian, the moody longtime leader of this team, and Del Potro, the towering 20-year-old prodigy, profess to be more at ease on faster surfaces than the clay that has long defined their nation’s tennis landscape and still accounts for more than 90 percent of its courts.The encouraging news for captain Alberto Mancini’s team is that it no longer has to be a host to Rafael Nadal, the world’s No. 1 player, who withdrew from Spain’s team last week because of tendinitis in his right knee.Nadal’s buff right biceps still features prominently on the official poster promoting this final. But the only Spanish players genuinely present are the slumping if still dangerous David Ferrer, two talented but erratic left-handers, Feliciano López and Fernando Verdasco, and a newcomer, Marcel Granollers.“I believe Argentina is going to win,” said José Luis Clerc who starred on the 1981 team with Guillermo Vilas. “What happened this year is what we all needed before: a good schedule. It never happened for us, and it never happened for these kids until now.”Vilas, with whom Clerc has long had a chilly relationship, is expected to make a rare appearance. That seems appropriate; he was born in Mar del Plata and polished his game as a teenager at the Lawn Tennis Club. Vilas memorabilia is a constant presence in Argentina. The trophy case at the Lawn Tennis Club contains an open-throated wooden racket he used to win the United States Open at Forest Hills in 1977. It also contains a yellow tennis ball he hit on his way to beating the United States in Davis Cup in Buenos Aires in 1977 in the club’s 4,000-seat main stadium.The only Argentine man to win a Grand Slam singles title since Vilas remains Gastón Gaudio, at the French Open in 2004. Nalbandian reached the Wimbledon final in 2002 and won the season-ending Tennis Masters Cup as an alternate in 2005. Both those achievements would pale in the collective Argentine consciousness compared with finally securing La Copa Davis.“If we win the Davis Cup, there will be a before and an after,” Nalbandian said. The long wait has only increased the pre-final buzz in Argentina. The cup, one of the grander trophies in world sport, has been making the promotional rounds here. It was on display at the Vilas Club last week and is now glittering courtside in Mar del Plata.The final is in Mar del Plata because Buenos Aires does not have an indoor arena of the requisite size and quality despite its population of about 14 million. The Vilas Club, which opened in 1993 with Vilas as a part-owner, is the most modern of the top tennis clubs that lie clustered on the edge of Palermo Forest in southern Buenos Aires.The Lawn Tennis Club and the Asociación de Deportes Racionales, which was founded in 1922, are traditional places that lie along the commuter train tracks, which helps explain how tennis and other sports codified by the British — rugby, golf and soccer — came to Argentina.“It started with people coming from England to work on building the railroad, and a lot of our sports clubs are, for that reason, near the tracks,” Salatino said.Vilas, like his successors, was much more than a clay-court specialist, winning the Australian Open twice on grass. But the Davis Cup exceeded his left-handed grasp. Now, 27 years later and in the absence of another great and bullish left-hander, his compatriots’ chances of laying their hands on it look very good indeed.'"
"'08-11-20,'0','Two longtime Republican lawmakers were named on Wednesday to the new five-member review panel set up to monitor the Bush administration’s $700 billion financial rescue plan and to recommend future reforms.The appointments were the final step in the creation of the Congressional Oversight Panel, established last month by the law that set up the bailout.The lawmakers chosen were Senator Judd Gregg of New Hampshire and Representative Jeb Hensarling of Texas.'"
"'08-11-20,'0','Before then, investors bearish about the commercial real estate sector didn’t want to bet against C.M.B.S. for fear the government might swoop in and buy the securities at inflated prices. But when that possibility dimmed, it increased expectations that value of C.M.B.S.’s would decline.Some investors believe the value of C.M.B.S. has fallen farther than the fundamentals of the underlying property market warrant, especially since many C.M.B.S. are insured or have extra collateral. That could be valid, although it sounds a lot like the arguments made a couple of years ago by residential-mortgage-security enthusiasts, who were proven wrong.Commercial mortgages have not yet defaulted on the scale of their residential counterparts. Those who pay mortgages on offices, hotels and retail shopping properties usually have deeper pockets than the average homeowner, and often don’t run short of cash until after tenants stop paying rent. But with unemployment spiking and consumer spending down, any cushion they may have is getting thinner. C.M.B.S. investors are paying the price for now. But if the erosion in the market continues, so will the rest of the financial system.A financial trick named after the world’s most grating musical instrument can’t be good. So it is with the so-called accordion feature, an option that lets companies increase their lines of credit with lenders. This peculiar mechanism found its moment in the last wave of leveraged buyouts, used, for example, when Apollo and the Texas Pacific Group acquired Harrah’s, and Apollo nabbed Realogy, the real estate brokerage. But these instruments are now being used to play an unexpected tune.The idea behind them is to let fast-growing companies add senior debt, secured by specific assets, without having to ask existing senior lenders for approval. In effect, the secured debt slice would simply expand like an accordion. That would be useful for property companies, say, who needed to finance acquisitions fast, and could refinance later.But in the current hard times, the accordions are being used in a different way. Take Realogy, parent of the Coldwell Banker and Corcoran real estate brokerages. Foreseeing a cash shortage, Realogy last week used its secured, senior debt accordion to offer bondholders a shrewd deal at the expense of junior lenders, who will now be paid a lower interest rate and take a loss on their original investment.It’s very hard for bondholders to say no to this big loss of principal and interest. If one bondholder doesn’t accept the offer, others surely will, putting any party that refused in a bind if things go wrong later. The accordion thus becomes less of an instrument, and more of an ultimatum to suffering lenders.The existing owners of senior secured paper have reason to be piqued too. Their stake is effectively diluted. True, if assets had to be sold, the original lenders would be paid back first. But if there’s not enough cash to do even that, these creditors may find they have to fight it out with the newcomers.Anyone who had considered that credit conditions and economies go down as well as up would’ve shied away from accepting accordion clauses in their loan agreements. But at the top of the market, few lenders prepared for tough times.'"

"'08-11-20,'0','Sales of music, movies, books, computer software, flowers and gifts have been hit the hardest, with double-digit declines, comScore said. “A lot of these retailers aren’t running on big margins to begin with, so it’s pretty challenging,” said Gian Fulgoni, chairman of comScore. “But it’s a Catch-22 situation: They have to run these deals because that’s what consumers are looking for this season.”To preserve the sanctity of their brands and some level of pricing control, some Web companies are promoting discount sites separately from their main brands. Zappos.com, a shoe retailer based in Henderson, Nev., never runs promotions on its site. Instead, it quietly moves shoes that do not sell in six months to 6pm.com, a clearance site it acquired last year, but runs separately. This month, the company is buying more search ads for 6pm.com, where a pair of colorful slip-on Keds sneakers is on sale for $12.73 — 74 percent off the original price on Zappos.com.Even when these extreme discounts mean selling shoes for less than Zappos.com paid for them, it is better to recoup some cash than none, said Tony Hsieh, the company’s chief executive.The discounting is not just drastic, but is also occurring unusually early in the season. Kmart, a division of Sears Holding, initiated Black Friday prices on electronics — 40 to 50 percent off — on Nov. 2, nearly four weeks before the real Black Friday, the busy shopping day just after Thanksgiving that usually marks the beginning of the holiday buying season.Kmart’s discounts are available both online and in stores, but the retailer is throwing in free shipping on Web purchases of $49 or more this week, a measure it has never taken before.E-commerce experts said they expected the cutthroat price competition to be fatal to some struggling retailers. “Folks that have been on the ropes or near the ropes during the good times are going to go under. There is no question about it,” said George Michie, co-founder of the Rimm-Kaufman Group, a search marketing company.Many boutique stores opened e-commerce sites because they were simple to build and inexpensive to run, yet those same advantages also forced them to compete with thousands of other sites selling similar products, each offering steeper discounts.Plasticland, now an online boutique selling clothes, home décor and jewelry, started in 2002 as a single store in San Diego. The owners, lured by the global audience of the Web, moved it online in 2005. They were caught off guard this spring, when sales started to plummet.The company, now based in Plano, Tex., switched to lower-priced merchandise and began moving unsold goods onto its clearance pages a month earlier than usual. A necklace with a red apple pendant now sells there for $32.50, down from $65, and a serving platter for $37.80, down from $54.“Our profit per piece obviously drops, which means that we have to ship a lot more merchandise to make the same amount of money,” said Rebecca Nyhus, the store’s co-owner. “Lowering price points has helped us weather the downturn, but it has really bogged us down because shipping is so time-consuming” and expensive.Like many other small e-tailers caught in the holiday margin squeeze, Plasticland was forced to raise its minimum order for free shipping to $100, from $50 to try to recoup some of the lost profits.Free shipping is becoming a painful imperative for all e-commerce sites. Three-quarters of online shoppers said in a comScore survey that they would shop elsewhere if a site did not offer free shipping, and nearly all sites offered it for at least some purchases.E-commerce giants like Amazon.com, which offers free shipping on orders over $25 and eliminates even that minimum for customers who pay a flat annual fee, can easily absorb shipping costs. But small online vendors struggle. Powell’s Books, a bookstore in Portland, Ore. with a site that competes for customers with Amazon.com, offers free shipping on orders over $50.“In our business model, we could not afford to give free shipping on every package. It just would not work,” said Dave Weich, director of marketing at Powell’s.To exacerbate matters, a major expense for online retailers seems to be rising: the cost to advertise products on the search engine Google, the source of considerable traffic and visibility for most e-commerce sites.Over the last year and a half, prices for text ads related to women’s fashion have quadrupled, say apparel retailers. In the popular gifts category, the price to advertise alongside results for common search queries like “gift baskets” jumped 50 percent from the 2006 holidays to 2007 and is expected to climb again this year.For Delightful Deliveries, a 10-year-old company that was selling gift baskets online, that extra expense — plus the challenge of competing on price against its own wholesalers, which also sell on the Internet — proved too much. The eight-employee company, based in Port Washington, N.Y., closed in September.Eric Lituchy, the founder of Delightful Deliveries, is now watching the Internet price war from the sidelines. “I think everyone is praying that this economy does not get any worse and that people find reasons for optimism and spend some money at Christmastime,” he said.'"

"'08-11-20,'0','Steven A. Ballmer, chief executive of Microsoft, told shareholders on Wednesday that the company was no longer interested in acquiring Yahoo, setting off a 21 percent decline in Yahoo’s share price.He reiterated that a partnership between Microsoft and Yahoo in the Internet search market was an “an interesting possibility.” There are currently no talks about such an agreement, he said.Mr. Ballmer’s stance may force Yahoo’s next chief executive to find another way to revive the company’s profit, which declined in 10 of the last 11 quarters as sales growth stalled. Yahoo’s chief executive, Jerry Yang, who spurned Microsoft bids of as much as $47.5 billion this year, announced plans two days ago to step down.Yahoo, based in Sunnyvale, Calif., fell $2.41, or 21 percent, to $9.14 a share. The shares, down 61 percent this year, are trading at their lowest price since February 2003.

"'08-11-20,'0','While the two sides continued their discussions, people familiar with the state of play said they did not expect any announcements this week and possibly not before Thanksgiving. Much like past presidents, Mr. Obama wants to announce his major appointments in clusters, so the secretary of state would be disclosed along with figures like the defense secretary and national security adviser.Mr. Clinton, whose relationship with Mr. Obama has been particularly fraught with tension, has been trying to send public signals through his representatives and friends that he will not stand in the way of his wife’s chances to serve as secretary of state.“I’m certain President Clinton will do whatever it takes, which means whatever President-elect Obama wants, to make the nomination acceptable, if he offers and she accepts,” said Lanny J. Davis, a longtime friend of the Clintons who was a special counsel in his White House and has consulted in recent days with the Clinton camp.But the dance between the two is complicated, and some in Mr. Obama’s circles were irritated that details of the discussions were leaking out, seeing that as an attempt to blame the incoming president if a deal does not come together. The former president’s concessions were first reported Wednesday in the Wall Street Journal.It was not clear that the conditions he has agreed to so far during discussions would be enough to satisfy Mr. Obama’s concerns about potential conflicts of interest.Some close to Mr. Obama said they believe Mr. Clinton would have to agree to forswear any personal income from foreign sources. Their goal, they said, is to head off any perception of conflict in the future rather than excavate all of Mr. Clinton’s activities in the eight years since he left the White House.Mr. Clinton’s foundation has received contributions from the Saudi royal family, the king of Morocco, a foundation linked to the United Arab Emirates and the governments of Kuwait and Qatar. His tax returns show that he collected at least $12.6 million since 2002 as an adviser to the billionaire investor Ronald Burkle, whose Yucaipa Companies have invested money for the Dubai government and acquired a stake in a Chinese media company.At the same time, Mr. Obama is also moving forward on other fronts, offering the job of health and human services secretary Mr. Daschle.The former Senate Democratic leader, who lost his seat in 2004, became an important early supporter of Mr. Obama’s run for the presidency.Democratic sources said Mr. Daschle has accepted the job. But aides to Mr. Obama said a formal announcement would not be made until after the national security and economic teams were unveiled. Mr. Obama’s transition team did announce Wednesday that Mr. Daschle will oversee the new president’s health policy working group.Mr. Daschle was initially considered for White House chief of staff, but Mr. Obama chose instead to name Representative Rahm Emanuel of Chicago. If confirmed, Mr. Daschle could end up being the point man on any efforts to overhaul the country’s health care delivery and insurance system, a tall order, health policy experts say, because of the current economic situation.The transition team has also signaled to Mr. Holder that he will be chosen to head the Justice Department, although no final decision has been made, according to people briefed on the discussions. Mr. Holder would be the first African-American to serve as the nation’s chief law enforcement official.Mr. Obama’s advisers appear to have overcome concerns that Mr. Holder’s involvement in a presidential pardon scandal as Mr. Clinton left office in 2001 might cloud his nomination for the job. But some Republicans made clear they still plan to make an issue of that.Mr. Holder was sharply criticized for not opposing a pardon for Marc Rich, the financier, and allowing the White House to bypass the normal pardon review process. Mr. Holder told the White House that he was “neutral, leaning toward favorable” on a pardon for Mr. Rich, whose former wife, Denise Rich, had contributed heavily to Mr. Clinton’s presidential library.“Instead of bringing the bipartisan ‘change’ to Washington that he promised voters, Barack Obama is rewarding yet another one of his political loyalists in Eric Holder,” Amber Wilkerson, a spokeswoman for the Republican National Committee, said in a statement Wednesday. “The only person who thinks Eric Holder represents ‘hope’ is Marc Rich.”On other fronts, the Obama transition team on Wednesday named seven policy working groups that will help to transform campaign promises to specific initiatives. Among the group leaders will be a former deputy national security adviser, James B. Steinberg, and a former assistant secretary of state, Susan E. Rice, for national security; a former White House aide, Daniel K. Tarullo, for economic issues; and a former director of the Environmental Protection Agency, Carol M. Browner, for energy and the environment. All four of those served in the Clinton administration.The Obama team also planned on Wednesday to designate several other White House officials whose appointments have previously been reported. Among them are David Axelrod, who was Mr. Obama’s chief campaign strategist and will now serve as the president’s senior adviser, and Gregory B. Craig, who was an impeachment defense lawyer for Mr. Clinton and will now be White House counsel.'"
"'08-11-20,'0','But with the House set to adjourn at the end of Thursday, the automakers were left with only the dimmest of hopes that Congress would provide any assistance this year.And though Mr. Reid did not completely close the door to a deal, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has repeatedly expressed strong opposition to the core of Mr. Bond’s proposal.In a sign of the pessimism among Congressional Democrats, the majority leader, Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland, told lawmakers on Wednesday evening that no House votes were expected Thursday, meaning the Senate was not expected to send over any legislation for approval.Mr. Wagoner met with Congressional leaders late Wednesday before leaving for Detroit, and while he declined to say if he expected some last-minute aid package, he said G.M. would welcome any form of assistance.“I think it best we leave what’s the best way to do this to the Congressional leaders and to the administration to sort out,” he said. “We’d be happy to work under any of the scenarios I’ve been told about.”Mr. Wagoner testified Wednesday that G.M. had not prepared a contingency plan for a bankruptcy filing if federal aid is not forthcoming. He said t G.M.’s advisers had concluded that it could not obtain credit to operate in a bankruptcy, and instead would have to consider liquidating its assets.The auto industry’s immediate future may now lie with the Bush administration, which has staunchly opposed using the Treasury Department’s $700 billion financial bailout program to aid Detroit. Democrats continued to insist Wednesday that the Treasury secretary, Henry M. Paulson Jr., has legal authority to tap the fund and should do so.“I talked to Secretary Paulson twice today; he knows he has authority,” Mr. Reid said on the Senate floor. “He doesn’t want to do it.”Mr. Bond, whose state houses factories for all of the Big Three, pressed Mr. Reid to consider an alternative plan that he and Senator George V. Voinovich of Ohio had been developing in consultation with Senator Carl Levin, Democrat of Michigan.“This is a critical time to move to prevent perhaps the bankruptcy or disappearance of a major auto company, which would cause chaos in our country,” Mr. Bond said. “Over three million jobs are related to the auto industry, from the auto assembly plants to the auto dealerships, parts suppliers.”But Mr. Reid said it was too soon to put it to a vote. “We’ve had no hearings. We have no text,” he said. “I know that my friend Senator Bond is a man of faith. I think I am, too. But this is carrying it a little too far. We don’t know anything about this. I look forward to a piece of legislation that we can look at. Hopefully, it can be done tonight or tomorrow and we’ll look at it.”He added: “But I want everyone to understand no matter how hard we work, how hard we try, the House of Representatives is going home tomorrow. O.K.? They’re leaving.”If Congress adjourns without approving any aid and the Bush administration refuses to act, the automakers will have to wait until President-elect Barack Obama takes office on Jan. 20, and even then there are no guarantees.It looks to be a rocky ride for the Big Three until then. G.M., for example, is using more than $2 billion in cash a month and may run short of the minimal level needed to operate by then.Already, the blame game has begun. At the White House, the press secretary, Dana Perino, said Wednesday that the administration supported Mr. Bond’s proposal and chastised Mr. Reid for not holding a vote on it.She said that if Congress leaves town without addressing the automakers’ plight, “then the Congress will bear responsibility for anything that happens in the next couple of months during their long vacation.""Mr. Wagoner, in the interview, declined to say whether G.M. would be insolvent by the time the new administration comes in.“Everybody is working like crazy to come up with additional cost savings. We’re going to do everything we can no matter what,” he said. “But the reason we’re down here now is we do think the time is urgent and the risk is high. We think it’s very high risk not to act now.”In testimony on Wednesday before the House Financial Services Committee, Mr. Wagoner and his counterpart at Chrysler, Robert L. Nardelli, said it was unlikely that their companies could survive much longer without emergency assistance.The chief executive of Ford Motor, Alan R. Mulally, said his company had enough cash to last through 2009 but that a failure by G.M. or Chrysler could have catastrophic effects on the industry.The four-hour hearing before the House committee raised many of the same concerns that were aired Tuesday’s hearing by the Senate Banking Committee.Republicans attacked the automakers for failing to fix their business models until they were on the verge of disaster.“A bailout, to me, raises fairness issues and does not solve the problem,” said Spencer Bachus of Alabama, the senior Republican on the committee.Jeb Hensarling, Republican of Texas, was among the skeptics. “I need to be convinced that if you get the $25 billion that it will actually make a difference.”'"
"'08-11-20,'0','The giant German chemical company BASF said Wednesday that it would temporarily halt or slow production at 180 plants around the world as it adjusted to a “massive decline in demand” brought by the economic turmoil.The company, based in Ludwigshafen, Germany, said demand in the automotive, construction and textile industries had declined sharply in recent months, necessitating the need to reduce overcapacity. The company will review its business in January and decide whether conditions warrant returning the plants to full production.Like other industrial companies, BASF has had to grapple with a sudden economic downturn that began in the second half of the year.“There is currently no demand for chemical products,” Peter Spengler, an analyst who covers the chemical industry at DZ Bank in Frankfurt, said. “The customer base is almost nonexistent in the fourth quarter because of inventory drawdown.”Mr. Spengler said that chemical companies had been hoping that Chinese demand would help to pick up the slack from Europe and the United States, but that it had failed to materialize.'"
"'08-11-20,'0','The vice chairman of the Fed, Donald L. Kohn, said that the risk of deflation, defined as a “general decline in prices,” remained slight but had increased. “Whatever I thought that risk was, four or five months ago, I think it is bigger now even if it is still small,” Mr. Kohn said in response to a question after a speech. The Fed, he added, would be aggressive, if necessary, to prevent a broad drop in prices.Stocks started falling shortly after 10 a.m. and ground their way down for much of the day before tumbling sharply in the last hour of trading. The broad Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index closed down 6.1 percent, to 806.58, falling below a low it set on Oct. 27. The index is now only 37 points above its October 2002 low. The Dow dropped 427.47, or 5.1 percent, to 7,997.28.Financial shares led the market down, with Citigroup falling by more than 23 percent and Bank of America closing down 14 percent. General Motors and the Ford Motor Company also tumbled as prospects for a federal aid packaged looked grim. “That spooked investors quite a bit,” said Sam Stovall, chief equity strategist at Standard & Poor’s Equity Research. “G.M. and Citigroup, two venerable companies, are right now on the ropes.”In the credit market, the price of corporate debt and bonds backed by commercial mortgages plummeted, while government bonds rallied as investors sought safe havens. The yield on the 10-year Treasury, which moves in the opposite direction from its price, fell to 3.32 percent, from 3.53 on Tuesday.Analysts say a sustained decline in consumer prices would be terrible for the economy. Businesses that cut prices to attract buyers are likely to have to lay off workers as well. They may also have little left over to pay lenders or shareholders.Prices are falling outside the United States too. Consumer prices declined in Britain, France, Germany and elsewhere in Europe in October, and prices were flat in September in Japan, which has fought deflation on and off for nearly two decades.The decline in consumer prices is all the more remarkable because this summer many economists were concerned about inflation and the prospect for stagflation, in which inflation and unemployment rise simultaneously, contrary to their usual relationship. “It’s funny that just a few months ago everyone was wringing their hands over inflation,” said Nariman Behravesh, chief economist at Global Insight. “It’s gone. It’s over.”But that concern has been quickly dashed, in large part because of a steep drop in commodity prices. Crude oil prices, for instance, have fallen more than 63 percent from their July peak of $145.29 a barrel, to $53.62 on Wednesday. The national average price for unleaded gasoline is now $2.05 a gallon, down from $2.92 a month earlier, according to AAA, the auto club.In fact, it now seems clear that the nation is entering a more frugal era after several years of conspicuous consumption.For instance, room rates at luxury hotels fell 5.4 percent in the 28 days ending on Nov. 15 — in contrast to a 1.3 percent increase in rates at midscale hotels that do not serve food, estimated Smith Travel Research, a firm that studies the industry. Over all, hotel prices fell 1.6 percent in October, according to the Labor Department.High-end retailers are resorting to drastic discounting to lure customers into stores. Executives at Nordstrom, the department store chain, said on a recent conference call with analysts that the company had lowered prices on more than 800 clothing styles by an average of 22 percent.Airfares, which were rising along with energy prices this summer, are now sliding as airlines struggle to fill seats on many popular routes. The average price of a one-way ticket is down about 20 percent from July, to $107 in mid-November, according to Harrell Associates, a firm that tracks the airline industry.Still, the so-called core price index — which excludes energy and food — was down a more modest 0.1 percent. The prices of goods and services like meat, alcohol, medical care and education increased in October.“It would take significant and persistent contraction in the economy to push core inflation into negative territory,” said Dean Maki, an economist at Barclays Capital in New York. “We do not think that is likely, especially given the aggressive policy response on the part of the Fed and Treasury.”The Fed has already cut its benchmark interest rate to 1 percent from 5.25 percent last year, and it has been lending hundreds of billions of dollars to banks and corporations in recent months to revive credit markets. The Treasury has also pumped nearly $300 billion into banks and other financial firms.The Fed is anticipating significant further slowing in the economy. A report released on Wednesday shows that the Fed now expects 2009 growth to be 1.8 percent to minus 1 percent, down from a previous forecast of growth of 1.9 percent to 3 percent.Even though the Fed’s target interest rate is close to zero, economists say there is much more the central bank and the government can do to revive the economy. In a speech in 2002, before he was the chairman of the Fed, Ben S. Bernanke said central banks could combat deflation by buying longer-term Treasury and mortgage-backed securities to drive down interest rates.“The Fed is going to ram liquidity into the financial system whether it is asking for it or not, just going out and buying assets and printing money in order to do it,” said Alan D. Levenson, chief economist at T. Rowe Price. “If you jam money into everyone’s pocket, they will spend it.”Furthermore, lawmakers in Washington are also expected to pass a significant fiscal stimulus package in January after the new administration and Congress take power. Policy makers could head off deflation by spending hundreds of billions of dollars on tax breaks, infrastructure projects and other initiatives.'"
"'08-11-20,'0','BEIJING — The United States opened a branch of the Food and Drug Administration here in the Chinese capital on Wednesday, the first of several overseas offices aimed at regulating the safety of imported food and medicine.The opening follows a string of scandals involving contaminated Chinese-made toothpaste, pet food, drugs and milk. The F.D.A. plans to open inspection stations in Shanghai and Guangzhou; offices will also be opened in India and Latin America.“We’re opening up a new era, not just new offices,” said Michael O. Leavitt, the secretary of health and human services, in announcing “a permanent F.D.A. presence in China.”The United States imported more than $321 billion worth of goods from China last year, and Mr. Leavitt said Tuesday that it was “clear you cannot inspect everything.” He said the goal of the new offices was to ensure safety standards and quality controls in foodstuffs and consumer goods “at the point of manufacture.”All three offices in China will work with Chinese agencies to inspect products bound for the United States. They will also certify third-party inspectors.'"

"'08-11-21,'1','Ms. Rist is said to have imagined the atrium as a pool or, as the curator Klaus Biesenbach describes it on moma.org, as an “oceanic volume of light, colors and sounds.” The video, in which action is periodically interrupted by soothing, lava-lamp imagery, successfully articulates that vision.An experimental-nursery-rhyme score, by Anders Guggisberg, is part of the experience. The video and music cycles are different lengths (16 minutes and 10 minutes, respectively), so that viewers who linger won’t see an exact repetition.Ms. Rist, who emerged as a video whiz in the 1990s, has dealt with intimidating architectural spaces before. As the Swiss representative to the 2005 Venice Biennial, she projected video on the ceiling of the San Stae church. There, as at the Modern, visitors could take their shoes off and rest on plush artist-designed sofas.Visually “Pour Your Body Out” is a kind of vanitas — a still life symbolizing the transience of earthly pleasures — set in motion. The camera lingers on ripe apples, luscious strawberries and fields of trembling tulips; fruits are smashed and petals are crushed, plucked and bitten. Fields of flowers, shot from ground level and projected 25 feet high, create a disorienting, Wizard of Oz sensation.The narrative, if there is one, would seem to be a Garden of Eden parable. The video’s protagonist, a naked woman, seizes a ripe apple with her teeth; later she splashes her way through a swampy lot littered with bruised fruits and crushed soda cans.In a looser and more interesting sense, though, “Pour Your Body Out” reflects an obsessive curiosity about nature. What is it like to be a tulip, or an apple? How do they see us? Where, in the ontology of the ecosystem, do our beings stop and theirs begin?Throughout the installation viewers are confronted with hyper-femininity (a hallmark of Ms. Rist’s art). Pink is everywhere, from the flowers in the video to the curtains that wall off the atrium from the upper galleries. Giant breasts, concealing the video projectors, protrude from the wall.In a memorable sequence from the video, a woman is submerged in a pool or lake. Gradually the water turns crimson; blood is pouring out of her body. You don’t need to be a feminist critic to understand the significance of a female artist unleashing a red torrent on MoMA’s immaculate white walls.Quick turns from sensuality to disgust, wide-eyed delight to snarling aggression, keep things interesting. Mud splatters on the apples; the voluptuous nude crawls through the dirt and sticks tulip petals up her nose. (Fans of Ms. Rist will remember the unhinged heroine of her installation “Ever Is Over All,” who bashed in the windows of parked cars with a giant flower stalk.)Coming less than two years after Doug Aitken’s “Sleepwalkers” projection on MoMA’s facade, “Pour Your Body Out” suggests that artists are still looking for new ways to fuse video and architecture. (Mr. Biesenbach, who also had a hand in “Sleepwalkers,” deserves some of the credit.)Large-scale, immersive projections are one way to create an experience you can’t have on YouTube. As Ms. Rist says on video, “The visitors bring their bodies to the museum. That’s different from the mass media coming to your living room.”So Ms. Rist is exhorting viewers to stretch out, kick off their shoes, even burst into song. She has turned the atrium into an enchanted space, or at the very least an inviting one.'"
"'08-11-21,'1','Within the bank’s Manhattan offices, television screens have stopped displaying the company’s stock price. Traders have begun making jokes comparing Citigroup to the Titanic.But there is a wide gap between what Wall Street investors and Citigroup’s executives believe about the company’s financial condition. Senior executives feel that Mr. Pandit has followed through on plans to aggressively shrink the company and control costs. The bank has sold tens of billions of dollars’ worth of risky assets, improved its capital position and announced plans to eliminate 52,000 jobs by next June. “We are entering 2009 in a strong position, much stronger than we entered in 2008,” Mr. Pandit said in a speech to employees this week. “We will be a long-term winner in this industry.”Yet as the drumbeat of bad news about the bank grows louder, investors remain unconvinced. Even a decision by Prince Walid bin Talal of Saudi Arabia, who bailed out Citicorp in the 1990s, to raise his stake to 5 percent Thursday failed to restore confidence in the bank. Two senior Citigroup executives said the bank had not approached him about raising his investment. The Saudi prince’s initial investment soared as Citigroup turned out record profits, only to evaporate over the last year.“The earnings power is there,” said Charles Peabody, a financial services analyst at Portales Partners. “It’s a question of getting through the credit issues.”Other big banks, like Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase, also tumbled Thursday as the broad stock market sank again, wiping out more than a decade’s worth of gains. And Goldman Sachs, once the most sterling American investment bank, fell below the $53 price at which it went public in 1999.Investors have long feared that the bad news for banks will get worse as the economy slows. But this latest rout in financial shares, which are now plumbing their lowest depths since the economic crisis broke out, reflects growing concern that banks like Citigroup will require vast sums of additional capital, possibly from the government, to cope with the pain to come.Home mortgages, credit card loans, commercial real estate debt — all are likely to deteriorate further now that a recession is at hand. Banks that have already lost billions of dollars could lose billions more.“All the danger signs are flashing red,” said Simon Johnson, a professor at the Sloan School of Management at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.Much of the fear centers on the unknowable. It is unclear just how bad banks’ losses on consumer loans, credit cards and mortgages will be as the economy weakens. Commercial real estate loans are deteriorating, and it is unclear whether banks have sold the worst of their holdings. Then there are all the investments that lurk off of banks’ balance sheets, in the so-called shadow banking system. And a new uncertainty has leapt to the forefront as the automotive industry teeters, sending investors scrambling to calculate how much banks are exposed to these loans.Several big banks hit record lows. Bank of America fell 13.86 percent to $11.25, JPMorgan slid 17.88 percent to $23.38 and Goldman Sachs slumped 5.76 percent to close at $52. Morgan Stanley neared a record low, closing down 10.24 percent at $9.20, while Wells Fargo fell 7.66 percent to $22.53.In a bid to calm nerves, Citigroup officials are meeting with other large shareholders. Last week, Citigroup’s chairman, Winfried Bischoff, traveled to Dubai and met with Sheik Ahmed bin Zayed al-Nahyan, the director of the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, according to two executives briefed on the situation.The renewed assault on financial stocks led the Financial Services Roundtable, an influential lobby group for the industry, to press regulators Thursday for another ban on short-selling, a strategy in which investors bet against declines in a share price.The current rout appeared to have gained momentum after Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. announced last week that the government would abandon its original plan to purchase troubled bank assets. That sent prices of commercial mortgage bonds and other loans into a nosedive. Mr. Paulson also said the Treasury would let the incoming administration determine how to deploy the remaining $350 billion left in the program.Yet investors have grown increasingly nervous about the appearance of a leadership vacuum in Washington as the financial markets burn, and some have begun saying that President-elect Barack Obama should move more rapidly to release a plan.“We really need somebody to step in and show leadership,” said Wilbur L. Ross Jr., chairman of WL Ross and Company, an investment firm that has been looking for bargains in the banking sector. “Every day that’s wasted and that we stay in freefall is going to make the recession that much deeper and longer.”That has workers in the financial industry bracing for more pain.“Major financial institutions have been taking write-downs all year, and what do you do next? You lay people off, and that decreases your need for office space,” said Harold Bordwin of the real estate group at KPMG Corporate Finance. “It’s very scary.”'"
"'08-11-21,'1','Still, with some 300 objects from other sources, there is more than enough material in the galleries to see and absorb. This is not a quick-take exhibition. Many pieces are small and intimate, made to be worn, handled and easily transported for sale or exchange: passed from hand to hand, from land to shipboard, and across seas to markets in other, often distant lands.For viewers who equate archaeological with monumental, the reduced scale can require some adjustment. The allure of cylinder seals, tiny, carved objects that fully reveal their images only when an impression is made, may at first be hard to grasp. But just a glance at an impression taken from one northern Assyrian seal, of a lithe stag leaping through brush and, it seems, scattering sparks as he goes, will be a convincer.If the size of such intricately made things encourages slow perusal, so does the proliferation of wall texts. Dense with place names, dates and information, they give the show the pace of a lavishly illustrated book, one composed of many short chapters broken up into subsections accompanied by occasional maps.Using an acoustic guide, the museum equivalent of E-ZPass, will speed up the tour. But a patient, step-by-step approach, looking and reading and looking again, is the best way to track the complex cultural interactions that made the ancient Near Eastern and Mediterranean regions in the Bronze Age (roughly 2200-800 B.C.) the proto-global phenomenon that they were.At the Met these interactions begin in Babylon, the melting pot city made powerful by Hammurabi (1792-1750 B.C.) and the source of an eclectic art. A bronze statue of a kneeling soldier, his face masked with gold, his finger to his lips as if asking for silence, was a votive offering to a Sumerian deity of an earlier age, while a ceramic goddess with wings and talons for feet is an exuberant arrival from cultural sources unknown.Referred to by archaeologists as “The Queen of the Night,” she is so hybrid a creation that she was at one time labeled a fake. She is now considered authentic, but authentically what is the question.Beyond this point, the geographic scope of networking expands exponentially, much of it driven by practical needs. The Bronze Age is named for an alloy of copper and tin essential to advancing technology, though its two basic ingredients were rarely found in the same place, requiring cooperative trade to bring them together.Such exchanges also embraced all kinds of other things, from raw materials to manufactured goods to intellectual and aesthetic influences. And by the middle of the Bronze Age, the eastern Mediterranean was bristling with commercial interdependencies, each of which had its own links to far-flung inland sources.Byblos, a coastal city in the Levant, just north of present-day Beirut, was a major supplier of raw materials to Egypt and a sponge for all things Egyptian. The Obelisk Temple excavated there has yielded hundreds of small male votive figures. (A handful are in this show.) Wearing cone-shaped hats and gold skirts, they clearly reflect Egyptian models. So does an exquisite gold image of a vulture with outstretched wings, though whether it was imported or locally made we don’t know.Egypt itself functioned as a kind of cultural collection agency, equally in love with oldness and newness. Copper chests discovered in 1936 in a temple at Tod, near Luxor, were filled with non-Egyptian objects. The chest on view in the Met show includes Central Asian amulets, silver cups from Anatolia or Syria and fluted silver bowls with wavelike patterns associated with Minoan Crete.Most exotic of all are the samples of raw and cut lapis lazuli, a blue stone mined primarily in Afghanistan. Some of these things were probably already antiquities at the time they were hidden away.For a truly cornucopian example of multiculturalism, though, nothing matches the contents of the Late Bronze Age merchant ship recovered from the sea off the southern coast of Turkey. Discovered by a sponge diver in 1984 and considered the oldest surviving example of a seagoing ship, it probably sank around 1300 B.C., packed with cargo representing a dozen cultures, from Nubia to the Balkans.Although the ship’s home port is unknown, it appears to have traveled a circular route through the Mediterranean and Aegean, stopping in Greece, Crete, Turkey, Syria and Egypt, picking up and unloading as it went. Bulk materials included copper ingots, Cypriot pottery, African wood and Near Eastern textiles, all for waiting markets.Divers also found luxury items, possibly personal possessions of the ship’s crew and passengers. Examples of ivory containers in the form of ducks have parallels with Egyptian prototypes, but were probably made in Mediterranean Asia. The two sources merge in a figure found in a tomb: a nude female swimmer with a chic, Nile-style pageboy who is hitching a ride behind an ivory-headed bird.More precious and enigmatic is a standing bronze figure of a woman, probably a goddess, her head and face still covered with the sheet gold that may once have encased her whole body in a radiant epidermis. The exhibition catalog suggests that she might be a talismanic charm intended to protect the ship from harm.Harm came anyway, as it did to much of the Mediterranean world, around 1200 B.C. with the arrival of mysterious, sea-based invaders, who conquered most of the great maritime cities, interrupting trade and easy cultural exchange, and bringing on a dark age, a depression. The depression — or was it severe recession? — didn’t last forever. The passion for acquisition, exchange and accumulation survived it, as it always does.This passion is, of course, our own. It is one reason that we can, if we try, identify with the diverse people who, thousands of years ago, made the objects in this show. The globalist, all-in-it-together world model they invented is another reason. Their dark age could be one too.'"
"'08-11-21,'1','Daniel Murphy, expected to platoon with Fernando Tatis in left field for the Mets next season, strained his right hamstring while playing in the Arizona Fall League. He will skip his winter ball assignment in Puerto Rico to ensure that he is ready for spring training.Murphy first felt discomfort in his right knee during batting practice on Nov. 11 and has not played since. A magnetic resonance imaging test taken Thursday revealed the Grade II, or moderate, strain.In Arizona, Murphy was hitting .397 with two home runs and 18 runs batted in.After making his major league debut for the Mets in August, Murphy batted .313 in 49 games and excelled as a pinch-hitter (a .462 average in 13 at-bats). His precocious performance at the plate convinced team officials that they had to find a spot in the lineup for him, but he is an average defender whose natural position is third base, where David Wright plays.The Mets had Murphy play second base in the fall league to increase his versatility, but he is set to receive the bulk of his playing time in left field next season and had been expected to be in left for Ponce in Puerto Rico.'"
"'08-11-21,'1','The International Air Transport Association reported on Wednesday that a decline in premium-class travel accelerated in September, down 8 percent, after a 1.5 percent drop in August.“The collapse of Lehman was a trigger event,” Willie Walsh, the chief executive of British Airways, said. “There was turmoil in the banking sector, and it was inevitable that we saw a falloff in bookings.”British Airways, which is heavily dependent on premium traffic on its trans-Atlantic routes, said that market rose 2.2 percent in August, but fell 8.6 percent in September and 9.2 percent in October. Mr. Walsh expects a decline in November.Air France-KLM, the biggest network carrier in Europe, reported a 96.2 percent drop in second-quarter net profit, to 28 million euros, or $35 million.The airline’s premium traffic grew 3.8 percent in the quarter that ended in September, compared with 9.9 percent from April to June. Although revenue rose 3.2 percent, to 6.695 billion euros, and overall passenger traffic increased 1.7 percent, the airline said it would reduce its expansion plans.The company will also cut an additional 260 million euros in costs in its 2008-9 financial year and postpone taking possession of aircraft, mainly Boeing cargo planes.“We are facing a difficult situation, and as we don’t have a crystal ball, we have to take the necessary measures,” said Mr. Spinetta, who will be succeeded in January by Pierre-Henri Gourgeon, deputy chief executive of Air France-KLM.Air France-KLM was able to fill its planes in October, but Mr. Spinetta said they were generating lower revenue. “The quality of our receipts was less good,” he said, “because there was a slide from the class at the front of the plane to the class at the back.”At British Airways, Mr. Walsh said the airline benefited when the investment bank Lehman Brothers sold some units. Lehman was not a major client, but some of its units were bought by banks that were, particularly Nomura and Barclays. “That’s a positive for us,” he said.Still, Mr. Walsh said trends in premium ticket sales were not always predictable. In August, typically a quiet month for corporate travel, British Airways’s overall premium ticket sales rose 2.2 percent because of leisure travelers.Industry executives say demand for premium class cannot simply be stimulated by cutting prices for business class, because business travelers tend to travel when they need to and are not as affected by price.Mr. Spinetta said Air France-KLM could make up some of the revenue shortfall in the front of the plane with the help of higher-price economy seats because it had 10 different classes in its economy cabins.Meanwhile, OpenSkies, British Airways’ fledgling, premium-only subsidiary, which flies the trans-Atlantic route from Paris and Amsterdam, has taken some business from Air France-KLM, though the effect had been “relatively marginal,” Mr. Spinetta said.Mr. Walsh said OpenSkies was performing in line with its business plan, aiming to break even or produce a small profit in its third year. But, he added, “the outlook is going to be tough.”'"
"'08-11-21,'1','France, which receives the biggest slice of European Union farm subsidies, worth about 9 billion euros a year, has opposed a radical overhaul of the system, saying rising food prices underscore the need for a robust program of regional support for farmers.But Britain has led arguments that freer trade is the best way to tackle food crises linked to sharply increased prices over the past year.European officials said even incremental changes in the policy would free farmers to produce more food based on market demand and allow the union to redirect money to preserving the countryside, protecting the environment and revitalizing rural areas.The reforms are “all about equipping our farmers for the challenges they face in the upcoming years, such as climate change, and freeing them to follow market signals,” said Mariann Fischer Boel, the union’s commissioner for agriculture and rural development. “I’m pleased we managed to find a compromise.”The measures also are positive for European trade relations, although the system still could distort markets by affecting prices and the way farmers work, said Indhira Santos, a research fellow specializing in European agriculture at the Bruegel research organization.“On paper these reforms make the European system more compatible with global trade rules,” Ms. Santos said. “In practice — although these changes might mean the payments are marginally less distorting — there’s really little difference because most of the money still goes to the same people.”Food prices in the European Union are significantly higher than they would be without the subsidies, Ms. Santos said, in contrast to farm supports in the United States, which had less of an impact on domestic food prices.But Jack Thurston, the co-founder of Farmsubsidy.org, which campaigns for budgetary transparency in European farm spending, said the reforms’ significance would be lessened because most of the international trade friction around European farming concerned tariffs, rather than quotas or spending.Among the measures agreed to early Thursday morning was an increase in annual milk production quotas each year ahead of a planned abolition of the quota system in 2015.European governments also agreed formally to abolish the so-called set-aside, which required some farmland to be kept out of production.The changes also reduce direct payments to midsize farmers — from an Irish cattle farmer to an Italian olive grower — and to very big landowners like the queen of England, grain barons in northern France and the owners of landholdings in formerly communist countries in Eastern Europe.Ms. Fischer Boel, the agriculture commissioner, had sought to reduce direct payments to the biggest subsidy recipients by up to 9 percent. But governments scrapped that plan, agreeing instead to reductions of 4 percent for payments above 300,000 euros a year.“The changes will not get the queen, the duke of Westminster, or Prince Albert of Monaco off of the front pages of newspapers for being the major beneficiaries of these payments,” said Mr. Thurston of Farmsubsidy.org.'"
"'08-11-21,'1','By 2025, it predicted, “the U.S. will find itself as one of a number of important actors on the world stage,” playing “a prominent role in global events” but not a decisive one as in the past.The report said the global shift from West to East in terms of wealth and economic power “is without precedent in modern history.” Of a projected population increase of 1.2 billion worldwide by 2025, Western countries would account for only 3 percent, it said.“We’re projecting a multipolar world,” C. Thomas Fingar, chairman of the National Intelligence Council and the government’s top intelligence analyst, said Thursday at a briefing on the report. “The unipolar moment is over, or certainly will be over by 2025.”The previous report in the Global Trends series, completed in 2004, anticipated continued American dominance through 2020, though it recognized that the emergence of China and India as powers would transform the geopolitical landscape.The new report describes a world riven by increased conflict over scarce food and water supplies and threatened by so-called rogue states and terrorists, widening gaps between rich and poor and an uneven impact of global warming. It said the chance of the use of nuclear weapons, while remaining “very low,” would rise in the next two decades as nuclear technology spreads.The report said Russia’s emergence as a world power was “clouded” by persistent corruption and lagging investment in its critical energy industry. It also noted, without naming a specific country, that a government in Eastern Europe “could be effectively taken over and run by organized crime.”Mr. Fingar acknowledged that the report, in the works for months, did not fully reflect the severity of the global economic crisis. But he said intelligence officials chose not to delay the report, judging that the long-term impact of the economic downturn would not be clear for months.The Global Trends reports are produced every four years by the National Intelligence Council, which represents all 16 American intelligence agencies, in part to inform long-term thinking by new administrations. The reports project various possible sequences of events in the future; the new publication notes, between dire forecasts, that “bad outcomes are not inevitable.”Even if Al Qaeda and other terrorist groups gradually lose support, the remaining violent extremists may have access to increasingly lethal technology, including biological weapons, the report found.The comments on Al Qaeda’s future are based in part on the work of David C. Rapoport, a professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, who has studied the cycles of terrorist activity in the past, including those associated with anarchism, Marxism and nationalism.The report said the global Islamic terrorist movement was likely to outlast Al Qaeda itself, with other groups likely to emerge and supplant it. But it expects a future of frustration and attrition for Al Qaeda, which Osama bin Laden built during the 1990s.The intelligence agencies noted that Al Qaeda had focused almost exclusively on terrorism, a contrast with groups like Hezbollah and Hamas, which have transformed themselves into political movements.“Al Qaeda has not achieved broad support in the Islamic world,” the report said. “Its harsh pan-Islamist ideology and policies appeal only to a tiny minority of Muslims.”'"
"'08-11-21,'1','In recent years, major investors have said that the company should do more to support the share price, and the company has responded with regular dividend increases. Those dividends are also a major source of income for the family of the chairman, Arthur Sulzberger Jr., whose family trust controls the company through a two-tier stock structure.The family trustees released a statement in support of the dividend cut, in language that seemed intended to deflect any speculation of a sale.“The trustees recognize that while this is very difficult for all shareholders, it is the appropriate and prudent business response given the extraordinary challenges of the current economic environment,” the statement said. “The trustees remain unanimous in their commitment to the editorial integrity and independence of The New York Times.”Mr. Sulzberger has said that it was not realistic for the family to take the company private, a path that has been suggested by analysts and bankers. But he made those statements when going private would have been far more expensive than it would be now.The company initially reported a small third-quarter net income, but amended that to a $106.3 million net loss after writing down the value of assets, and it is not clear whether it will post a profit for the year. Standard & Poor’s lowered its credit rating for the Times Company below investment grade last month, and Moody’s Investors Service said it was considering a similar move.The company has cut costs aggressively, but so far, those savings have not kept pace with a rapid drop in newspaper advertising revenue. It has not yet said how much it would save from the planned closing of a subsidiary that is a major distributor of newspapers and magazines to retail outlets.For short-term cash needs, the company has two $400 million revolving credit accounts, one of which expires next May. As of Sept. 30, the company was carrying almost $398 million in short-term debt under those accounts.'"
"'08-11-21,'1','The speed of the falloff is a testimony to the world’s dire economic straits. As growth slows in the United States, Japan and Europe, many analysts say they believe global oil demand is headed for its first annual decline in 25 years.The drop in prices could not have come soon enough for consumers. Gasoline prices are down about half since July, easing some inflationary pressures. Falling energy costs are also providing some breathing room for the economy, although they have also ignited fears of deflation — a broad drop in prices across the economy.For oil producers, the collapse is dire news. The downturn will probably herald a depressed cycle for the energy industry as markets shrink and prices drop. Dozens of large-scale projects have already been canceled or delayed because of the fall in prices and financing constraints. They include refineries in Saudi Arabia, offshore fields in Brazil and projects to exploit tar sands in Canada.Some experts warn that lower energy prices could set the stage for a new phase of higher prices when the economy eventually recovers, as companies are now cutting back their investments in future supplies to cope with the downturn.As much as four million barrels of future oil production capacity could be jeopardized if prices remain below $60 a barrel, according to estimates by Cambridge Energy Research Associates, a consulting firm. This means that the sharper the drop in prices now, the steeper the rebound might be when the economy picks up again. “Sub-$50 oil means a lot of investments are not going to be made,” said Philip C. Adams, an energy and utilities analyst at Gimme Credit. “What you’re probably doing is setting the stage for the next price spike.”In the short term, exporters are feeling the sting, and some producers are becoming desperate to stop prices from falling further. The OPEC cartel, whose members draw most of their income from oil exports, has called another emergency meeting in Cairo next week — less than a month after its members agreed in an emergency session to trim production, to little effect on the price of oil.There does not seem to be much else the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries can do as demand for oil declines. Adam Sieminski, a Deutsche Bank analyst, said prices could fall as low as $30 to $35 a barrel next year. The last time oil was at that level was in December 2003.In the United States, retail gasoline prices, which had risen above $4 a gallon during the summer, have plummeted to $2.02 nationwide, according to AAA, the automotive group. Gasoline is selling for less than $2 a gallon in 23 states, including Michigan, Ohio and Nebraska.The drop-off in consumption has been particularly acute in the United States, the world’s top oil consumer.Gasoline demand, which accounts for more than half of the nation’s oil use, fell sharply during the summer as higher prices forced Americans to scale back their driving. The cutback has persisted as broad economic anxiety has displaced worry about gasoline prices.According to a weekly survey by MasterCard, gasoline consumption was down 2.8 percent last week compared with the same week a year earlier, its 30th consecutive weekly drop.The Energy Department has estimated that domestic oil consumption this year will have its steepest drop since 1980, falling by more than 1.1 million barrels a day, or 5.4 percent. The government expects oil demand next year to fall by an additional 250,000 barrels a day, or 1.3 percent.“Clearly the market does not need the oil because demand has collapsed,” said Francisco Blanch, a commodity strategist at Merrill Lynch.But the underlying factors that drove prices to their records in recent years have not really disappeared.Many producing countries remain mired in trouble. Nigeria seems incapable of resolving a long-running insurgency in its main oil producing region that has forced oil production to be slashed by a third.In Mexico, political squabbling between the governing party and the opposition has frozen efforts to open up the oil sector to foreign investments while the country’s largest oil field is declining at an alarming rate. Oil production is also declining in Russia, Norway and Iran, for a variety of reasons.The speed with which companies are reacting to the difficulties is beginning to worry energy experts since it often takes a decade or more for oil fields to be developed and start production. Analysts at Morgan Stanley estimated that as of Nov. 5, 19 industry projects had been delayed or faced cutbacks; by Nov. 18, that had jumped to 44 projects.“The risk is that 2009 cuts to investment plans increase these longer-term supply risks,” the analysts said in a report.'"
"'08-11-21,'1','GMAC Financial Services, the financing arm of General Motors, said Thursday that it had applied to the Federal Reserve to become a bank holding company, which would allow it to become eligible for aid under the Treasury’s $700 billion bank rescue plan.The company said the change in status would shore up its capital position and allow it to continue providing automotive and mortgage financing.GMAC is majority owned by the private equity firm Cerberus, which also owns most of Chrysler. General Motors, which itself is running out of cash, owns a 49 percent stake.GMAC also is starting cash tender offers to buy or swap debt held by its units and mortgage business Residential Capital for cash, new notes or preferred stock, in a move to bolster capital levels and reduce debt.With the move, GMAC would follow several other financial institutions that have made similar applications in efforts to strengthen their financial positions, including the credit company, American Express; the investment banks Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley; and the commercial lender CIT Group.'"
"'08-11-21,'1','ZURICH, Switzerland — The Swiss National Bank, the country’s central bank, cut its key interest rate in half to 1 percent on Thursday, its second reduction this month.The central bank’s decision Thursday comes amid expectations other central banks, including the Federal Reserve in Washington will also cut rates further to support growth.Before this month, the Swiss bank had reduced its rates only once in five-and-a-half years.Falling prices give central banks room to lower interest rates. The cuts can ignite economic activity, but currencies often suffer as investors move their money in search of better returns.Inflation in Switzerland has dropped markedly as energy and commodity prices have eased. It is expected to fall below 2 percent by year-end — a crucial threshold that some banks look to as conducive to growth.'"
"'08-11-21,'1','Germany, Britain and the Netherlands had held up the aid package in a dispute over compensation payments for overseas depositors in the Icesave unit of Landsbanki. The three have agreed to extend additional credit to Iceland that will enable it to repay the depositors about $26,000 each, in line with European Union law.Poul Thomsen, the head of the I.M.F. mission to Iceland, said in a conference call that the total compensation for Icesave customers would be $5 billion to $6 billion.All told, Iceland is borrowing at least $10 billion, or about $33,000 for each of its 300,000 residents.The increasing severity of the global credit and economic crises has put great stress on many smaller and developing nations as capital flees to Japan, Europe and the United States.The Turkish prime minister, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, said Thursday on television that he hoped a deal with the monetary fund would be reached by next week. An official in his party said earlier that a deal of $20 billion to $40 billion was likely.Dominique Strauss-Kahn, the monetary fund’s managing director, said Saturday that there was “some disagreement” on the size and terms of a bailout package, which would be Turkey’s fourth in 10 years. But he said he was confident that a deal would be reached quickly.In addition to Iceland, the monetary fund has recently announced bailout programs for Hungary, Pakistan, Serbia and Ukraine, and created a credit line of as much as $100 billion for healthy countries with liquidity shortages. The Latvian finance minister, Atis Slakteris, said Thursday that Latvia would seek help from the fund to ensure the stability of its financial sector.Belarus is also talking with the fund about aid.Having gotten its bailout, Iceland now faces a long road to restoring its economy and its currency, the krona. The country’s financial markets have been effectively frozen for the last month. Mr. Thomsen, the monetary fund official, said that the immediate needs were to get foreign exchange market operating and to stabilize the krona.'"
"'08-11-21,'1','The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index fell 6.7 percent, leaving that benchmark down about 52 percent from its peak in October 2007. The Dow Jones industrial average closed at 7,552.29, barely above its low in October 2002 during the depths of the last bear market. The Nasdaq fell 5 percent, to 1,316.12.“This is a response to real fear,” said Marc D. Stern, chief investment officer at Bessemer Trust, an investment firm in New York. “We each have to look inside and say, is the fear warranted?”The fear was reflected in a stampede for the safety of government securities. The Treasury’s benchmark 10-year bill rose 2- 22/32, to 106- 10/32 and the yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, was at 3.01 percent, down from 3.32 percent late Wednesday.The sell-off in equities gathered force over the last several days and brought an abrupt end to what had been a modest improvement in financial markets. After the Federal Reserve began making short-term loans directly to businesses last month, a semblance of normalcy returned to credit markets, and the stock market, although volatile, held above its old lows.But investor confidence, which has been shaky since the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers, was dealt a severe blow when the Treasury Department announced last week that it would not buy troubled mortgage assets using the $700 billion that Congress approved in October. Economic reports showing rising unemployment, falling consumer prices and disastrous retail sales compounded the damage. The risk that one or all of the Detroit automakers might go bankrupt added to the gloom.“The profit drag on corporate America is widening and deepening, and this is leading to more layoffs and cutbacks in capital spending, which is extending and deepening the recession,” said Stuart Schweitzer, global markets strategist for J.P. Morgan Private Bank. “We’ve gotten into a full-blown, self-feeding downturn.”More bad economic news arrived on Thursday morning the Labor Department reported that new claims for unemployment benefits rose to a seasonally adjusted 542,000 last week, the highest level since July 1992. Unemployment is also climbing at a rapid clip in Europe, and the once-sizzling economies in Asia and Latin America are starting to sputter. Early on Friday, Singapore reported that its third-quarter gross domestic product fell at a 6.8 percent annualized pace.In Asian trading early Friday, stocks were down nearly 3 percent in Japan, Australia and New Zealand. On Thursday, most European markets closed down more than 3 percent for the day.The global nature of the slowdown is a reason that oil prices have fallen spectacularly in recent months. On Thursday, oil futures, which had touched $145 this summer, settled below $50 a barrel for the first time since 2005.The sell-off in markets has been all the more severe because of forced selling by hedge funds, mutual funds, insurance companies and banks, all of which are being compelled to sell at the same time because of pressures from investors, lenders, regulators and rising insurance claims.There have been spectacular declines in investments like commercial mortgage-backed securities, which are collections of loans backed by shopping malls, office buildings and apartments. Prices of those securities have fallen 20 percent just this month, mostly in response to a report about anticipated defaults on just two loans. The price of insuring against a default on commercial mortgages has more than doubled in less than a week.“Where the credit markets are trading, it’s all but implying a 1929 scenario,” said Joe Balestrino, fixed income strategist at Federated Investors, who added that he thought prices had fallen too far in many cases.The troubles in the credit market are not limited to risky assets. The mortgage finance companies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which the government took over in September, have had to pay a steep premium over rates at which the Treasury borrows because policy makers have not explicitly guaranteed their debt.Investors said the weak condition of many large banks had exacerbated the pain in the financial system because those institutions served as critical intermediaries in the trading of securities, particularly in the credit markets, where securities do not trade on exchanges. Because they need every spare dollar to shore up their own health, those banks are not as willing to make markets in securities that may be even slightly risky.Shares of Citigroup, for instance, have fallen more than 50 percent this week, to $4.71. Earlier in the week, the bank said it would nearly double previously announced layoffs to 52,000, or 14 percent of its total staff. Other big institutions like Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley have been reducing their reliance on borrowed money because they have decided to become bank holding companies subject to regulation by the Federal Reserve.“They are the middleman, and they have just gotten killed,” Andrew Feltus, a bond fund manager at Pioneer Investments, said about big banks and securities firms.Still, in a sign that some investors have not lost all faith, two dozen stocks in the S.& P. 500-stock index rose, albeit barely, and among them were two of the American’s troubled automakers.General Motors and Ford had a rare positive day on Thursday after Congressional leaders left open the door for federal aid to them and for Chrysler, which is privately held. Still, Democratic leaders criticized the executives of the companies and said they needed to make a more persuasive case that they would be responsible stewards of government money. G.M. and Ford were up slightly, though still close to their lowest levels in decades.'"

Another officer said three missiles had been fired.Villages around Mir Ali have been struck by missile attacks several times, and fighters with Al Qaeda and the Taliban have operated from that area and elsewhere in Pakistan’s tribal regions near the border with Afghanistan.There have been at least 20 United States strikes in the tribal lands in the past three months. Pakistan says the attacks violate its sovereignty, undermine efforts to win public support for the fight against militants and make it harder to justify their country’s alliance with the United States.The attack on Wednesday that sparked the diplomatic protest was unusual in that it took place deeper in Pakistani territory, in Bannu district, an area outside the semiautonomous tribal lands near the border, where most other attacks have focused.An Arab killed in the attack in Bannu was identified by a Pakistani intelligence officer as a known Qaeda operative, Abdullah Azam al-Saudi, though there has been no other corroboration.'"
"'08-11-22,'0','Facing the resistance of a democratic Congress and under domestic pressure to obtain approval of the Colombian trade pact, President Álvaro Uribe broke a tradition of impunity by dismissing 27 soldiers and officers, including three generals, allegedly involved in the production of “false positives,” a macabre practice of killing civilians and dressing their bodies in camouflage to claim credit for success in fighting leftist guerrillas.The Leahy Law, intended to prevent United States assistance to military units involved in violation of human rights, has been widely ineffective.Withholding the passing of the Colombian free trade agreement until effective action is taken has conveyed the message that the United States does care about human rights and stands for what it preaches.Vice President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr., an architect of Plan Colombia, a 10-year-old program of military cooperation with Colombia, will be the more credible influence to push the proper decision at the proper time in this regard.The writer, a medical doctor and medical director of Catholic Charities, New Jersey, was human rights assistant to President Virgilio Barco, 1986-88.Bravo to The Times for defending the free trade agreement with Colombia.There had been talk of a quid pro quo in which Democrats would approve such an agreement in return for government aid to the auto industry. The idea has merit, but the irony here is that Colombia is a nation that is emerging from the darkness and has embraced its future without self-pity or denial. The converse of the Detroit Three, some would say!“Pass the Colombian Trade Pact” urges Congress to pass this free trade deal because walking away “would alienate many people in Colombia and undermine Washington’s credibility.”The economic crisis has profoundly changed United States relations with Latin American countries, including Colombia. How can “free market” solutions be imposed on Colombian people — or any other Latin American society — by the same bankers and politicians who have suddenly embraced government bailouts? And how would pursuing such discredited neoliberal policies give “credibility” to Washington?The election of Barack Obama has also transformed United States relations with Latin American countries. In a few short weeks, an Obama administration will have the opportunity to rebuild respectful multilateral relationships in the hemisphere. It is much more likely that rushing to pass this deal in the midst of an economic meltdown and United States political transition would alienate Colombians.The writer is an associate professor of geography and Latin American studies at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill.I agree on the points you made in favor of the United States-Colombia free trade agreement. Let me add another point: genuine concerns over human rights should lead to promoting trade and economic performance. A reverse rationale flows against common sense, and lends a hand to interest groups that want to restore the ill-bred state of affairs that years ago placed Colombia on the brink of disaster.Colombia is still far from being a model state. But let it keep moving in the right direction.Ecuadoreans respect Colombia’s decision to enter into free trade agreements, but fail to see how discussions of the bilateral Colombia-United States free trade agreement involve Ecuador.To illustrate your pro-free trade agreement position for an important ally in a volatile corner of South America, you refer to Ecuador’s decision not to renew a United States military lease for Manta Air Base. Yet Colombia and other neighboring countries have also denied United States requests for bases.Ecuador’s foreign minister qualified United States-Ecuador relations as excellent, and we remain the only Andean nation with zero coca cultivation. Ecuador’s counternarcotics efforts have been lauded by the United States State Department, the Department of Defense and the Bush administration.As part of these efforts, we recently started Plan Ecuador, which includes taking over duties performed out of Manta. We have also stationed one-third of our national army along our northern border with Colombia to compensate for a lack of Colombian state presence in the area, as documented in a United States Government Accountability Office report released this month.'"

One does not need to have any particular religion to recognize this, or that the family based on marriage is the best way to bring up happy, productive children.In defending traditional marriage and the family, we are not limiting personal freedom and dignity. We are defending them.The events that forced the resignation of Scott Eckern as artistic director of the California Musical Theater were self-defeating acts of intolerance.While anger over Mr. Eckern’s financial support for Proposition 8 is understandable, pressuring him to resign from a job he had successfully held for many years crossed the line into punishing a person for his political views. This sends a chill throughout the theater community.Those who support gay marriage and gay rights risk much if they forget the basic democratic principle that people should be able to express their political and religious views, as well as their sexual orientation, without fear for their jobs.In a culture where teachers are reprimanded and even fired for teaching about homosexuality, and where the military still maintains a policy of “don’t ask, don’t tell” and discharges anyone who does tell, advocating free speech and tolerance would be a far better tactic than forcing someone out of his job because of his personal beliefs.You report that Scott Eckern, the artistic director who resigned from the California Musical Theater, said in a statement that his donation in support of Proposition 8 “stemmed from his religious beliefs — he is a Mormon — and that he was ‘deeply saddened that my personal beliefs and convictions have offended others.’ ”I don’t think Mr. Eckern understands the appropriate message. I doubt if anyone begrudges him his personal beliefs and convictions. The offense lies in his efforts to enshrine his beliefs into law.You report that Scott Eckern resigned as the artistic director of the California Musical Theater “in the face of growing outrage over his support for a ballot measure this month that outlawed same-sex marriage in California.”Apparently some in the theater and gay rights communities do not think Mr. Eckern should be allowed to express his political views or religious beliefs.People like Marc Shaiman, the composer of “Hairspray” who had said he would not let his work be performed in the theater, were clearly on a witch hunt to blackmail those who do not agree with their views.I fear for the future of California residents who supported Proposition 8.'"

We hope it is a good plan, because the lame-duck Congress does not have a choice.’s three car manufacturers have said that they would go bankrupt this year without an infusion of taxpayers’ money. Failing to provide it would be a truly irresponsible act that could obliterate one or more companies, potentially causing other bankruptcies and costing many hundreds of thousands of jobs.Unpalatable as it seems to underwrite the proven record of failure of Detroit’s automakers, Congress must provide sufficient money to shore them up until the Obama administration takes office. Then, the new president and new Congress can decide how to manage either a rescue package with tight strings attached or a bankruptcy process that ensures the fallen companies have a reasonable shot at picking up the pieces.Bankruptcy proceedings are designed to allow ailing companies to be restructured into profitable businesses, but that is by no means guaranteed — and it requires infusions of credit.In the current financial environment, where even the soundest companies are having trouble getting loans, the government would have to guarantee that financing is available so that any car company under bankruptcy protection could keep operating and paying its workers and suppliers while it is restructured.'"

"'08-11-22,'0','“I think I shot him because I think he was suffering,” he says of his father.A few minutes later, the boy says his stepmother, at his father’s request, had spanked him five times the day before the shootings. An officer then asks whether he was angry at his father the day the men were shot. “The first time I was mad at him,” he says, “but he was already shot, and I shot him again.”Legal experts doubt that the confession will be admissible in court, because the police never told the boy of his right to silence and to a lawyer, and because he was interviewed without a parent or a lawyer present.Prosecutors say the reason is that he was initially being interviewed as a victim and did not become a suspect until he gave contradictory statements during questioning.But Dale Baich, an assistant federal public defender in Phoenix, said, “At the point where the police decided the boy was no longer a victim and was a suspect, that’s when the questioning should have stopped.”Judy Stinson, a clinical law professor at Arizona State University and former juvenile prosecutor, said the legal issue centered on when the interview became a “custodial interrogation” from which he was not free to leave.“The level of forcefulness used by the police includes the defendant’s perception about whether he is free to go and able to leave,” Ms. Stinson said. “An 8-year-old child is not free to go.”Any statements made by the child after the point at which the interview became a custodial interrogation would most likely be inadmissible in court, she said.The lack of parental presence during the interview is not as critical a factor as the absence of a lawyer, said Steve Drizen of the Center on Wrongful Convictions at the Northwestern University School of Law.“Parental representation does not adequately protect the child,” Mr. Drizen said. “What is needed with children of this age is an attorney.”Even if the boy had been read his rights and been free to leave, it is doubtful that his confession would stand up in court, given the susceptibility of young children to confessing crimes they did not commit, child psychologists said.“Just because this 8-year-old said he shot the father and the other man gives us no great confidence that he really did,” said one leading expert in child confessions, Steve Ceci, professor of developmental psychology at Cornell. “We can take most 8-year-olds off the street and get them to eventually admit they did this as well.”The boy is being held in a juvenile detention center, though he is to spend Thanksgiving with his mother on a 48-hour furlough. The St. Johns police have urged prosecutors to try him as an adult, but no decision has been made.Trying an 8-year-old as an adult would be unprecedented in modern jurisprudence, said Thomas Grisso, director of the law-psychiatry program at the University of Massachusetts Medical School.“I have never heard of an 8-year-old being tried as an adult,” Dr. Grisso said. “It would be more than extraordinary. It would be totally unique.”'"
"'08-11-22,'0','This is the future that virtually everyone in the city wants. But the people at the seminary are, in Ms. Burnley’s phrase, “institutionally exhausted” by the four-year siege of red tape, and after spending 50 percent more money than they had expected.“At a certain point we became angry, and determined, and wouldn’t give up,” she said. “But you can’t create public policy that depends on having obsessed, hardheaded people to get these projects done.“People are prepared to deploy these strategies,” she said about the enthusiasm for new green approaches. “Policymakers need to get beyond the grand goals and figure out what the way is to move forward.”In theory, no city in the country should be quicker to welcome such a project. Buildings are by far New York’s biggest source of carbon emissions. And last year, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg laid out one of the country’s most ambitious plans to reduce the use of carbon-based fuels. With each presentation, the vision and depth became more apparent.The aspirations of the mayor and his planners on paper, however, cannot come to life without the consent of the city’s bureaucracy. “Those folks in the agencies don’t seem to feel that they answer to the executive branch,” Ms. Burnley said.At one point, the seminary waited three months for the city Department of Transportation’s permission to drill into the sidewalk, Ms. Burnley said. “The conversation went like this: ‘What is the status?’ ‘It has no status.’ ‘Do you need more information?’ ‘No, we have what we need.’ ‘Then how can we get it moving?’ ‘You can’t get it moving.’“We were in absolute purgatory,” she said. “What was going on was an internal debate between the engineers and what are the real world requirements, and the lawyers with the legal requirements.”If geothermal is to become a practical application, Ms. Burnley added, “someone has to lock all these engineers in one room, lock those lawyers in another room, and try to make this affordable and doable.”Besides the Department of Transportation, among the agencies that had a say were the city’s Department of Environmental Protection, because a branch of a water tunnel runs beneath part of the seminary, and the state’s Department of Environmental Conservation, because its Division of Mineral Resources issues permits for mining operations.All of those agencies had legitimate public interests to protect. They just didn’t want to act at the same time, in the same place.“I sat in a room with D.O.T. trying to get D.E.P. and D.E.C. to sit together,” Mr. Frawley said. “I wasn’t able to make it happen. The mayor can stand up on a podium and talk about New York in 2030, but we’re the application of that — we’re the ones trying to make it happen.”Whenever the project seemed to have stalled beyond hope, Ms. Burnley said, the geothermal team was able to get it moving again with help from a policy adviser in the Bloomberg administration, Ashwini Chhabra.Geothermal equipment is expensive to install, but it is well-suited for institutions that have time to recoup the initial costs, Ms. Burnley said.But are there enough people like Ms. Burnley and Mr. Frawley — human drill bits — to drive through the crust of the status quo? She laughed. Not drill bits, she said, “human battering rams.”'"
"'08-11-22,'0','“Our goal is to make this movie one of the top three-grossing movies of the weekend,” Ms. Balliett said in an e-mail message.Yet the unforeseen alignment between “Milk” and the gay-marriage ban — there was no Proposition 8 on any ballot when the director Gus Van Sant began shooting the film in January — also creates a conundrum for those Focus executives. How do they honor their movie hero’s feisty brand of confrontational politics without being consumed by them?To join the fight could turn off some of the viewers Focus needs to make “Milk” a broad-based hit. But to sidestep it might disappoint a core audience that has begun to see the film as a rallying point.Mr. Milk, played in the movie by Sean Penn, was not one to pull punches. “If this thing passes, fight the hell back!” Mr. Penn says at a pivotal point in the film, as his allies ponder the likely passage of Proposition 6, a 1978 ballot initiative aimed at curbing gay rights in California. (It failed.)But Focus has been stepping carefully of late.In a particularly ticklish exercise, the studio continues to plan showings of “Milk” in theaters owned by the Cinemark chain, whose chief executive, Alan Stock, donated to the campaign for Proposition 8.Taking a cue from Milk — who made his political breakthrough by supporting a union boycott of Coors beer — opponents of the marriage ban have begun their own boycott through a Web site, NoMilkforCinemark.com.In a statement issued on Wednesday, Cinemark, one of the country’s largest theater chains, said its decision to proceed with plans to show the movie also reflected a principle: “It would be inappropriate to influence our employees’ position on personal issues outside the work environment, especially on political, social or religious activities.”On Thursday James Schamus, the chief executive of Focus, struck a diplomatic note. “I know there’s a lot of anger out there,” said Mr. Schamus, who noted that Cinemark three years ago was among the first chains to embrace the studio’s gay-themed “Brokeback Mountain.”“I hope that gets settled,” he said of the boycott call.With similar delicacy, Dustin Lance Black, the film’s writer, and Cleve Jones — a Milk associate who is portrayed by Emile Hirsch in the movie, and served as its historical consultant — published a manifesto in The San Francisco Chronicle last week calling on President-elect Barack Obama, who has opposed same-sex marriage, to support comprehensive federal legislation guaranteeing gay rights, including the right to marry.But the pair did not identify the manifesto with “Milk,” despite the film’s strong call for exactly such equality.“I don’t know that it would be appropriate,” Mr. Jones said of any effort to align the movie with the campaign against marriage bans in California and other states. The danger, he said, was that conscious campaigning might seem to exploit, rather than support, Mr. Milk and his legacy.Even so, Mr. Jones, over the last few weeks, has conducted politically robust discussions keyed to Focus-sponsored college screenings of “Milk” in a number of cities, including Boston and Washington.Speaking separately, Mr. Black said he viewed the movie itself as a contribution to the movement it portrays. And the manifesto, with its call for broad federal action, he added, was directly inspired by Mr. Milk’s critical stance toward gay contemporaries who demanded too little.“They weren’t asking for what they wanted,” said Mr. Black, who spoke from Salt Lake City, where he was planning to screen the film on Friday. “They were asking for crumbs.”In the same spirit, Daniel Nicoletta — another Milk associate, who is portrayed in the film by Lucas Grabeel of “High School Musical”— said last week that he believed the opposition to Proposition 8 would inevitably fade, but that he hoped for a boost from the movie’s release. “We need that excitement,” he said, speaking of actions like the one planned by Mr. Milliner.In Mr. Schamus’s view, the filmmakers and others are free to politick as they please.But, he said, to identify “Milk” directly with a position — even one popular enough among Oscar voters to enhance the film’s prospects in a heated awards race — is to misunderstand how the cinema really effects change.“The way movies work is not by pushing toward or appealing to a specific electoral position, but by changing the climate of opinion,” Mr. Schamus said.And to push too hard, he cautioned, risks losing sight of what he sees as the main point of “Milk”: “There is actually a great, old-fashioned American narrative movie here.”'"
"'08-11-22,'0','Several moments and one extended episode in Beth Gill’s latest work at the Kitchen, “what it looks like, what it feels like.,” are entirely engrossing as choreography. At most points Ms. Gill shows a theatrical sense of space and especially lighting (which is by Joe Levasseur). Memorable images occur. But they are too few and too deliberately paced.Most of the movement happens in silence, and does not consist of what most of us call dancing. The performers walk, crawl, slowly bend, squat, lie down, sit up, extend their arms, and that’s what you see for perhaps more than three-quarters of the performance. I have no objection to looking at basic pedestrian movement, but it courts the danger of cliché just as much as multiple turns and acrobatic circuits of jumps. Much of the first half of “what it looks like” struck me as a tepid, plodding return to the dance minimalism of the 1970s.Markedly more symmetrical, though. One dancer, going through her slow ritual, center stage, of bending, lying down, squatting, rising and opening her arms, kept being approached deferentially by two female dancers, from the left. Ignoring them, she just carried on.Because this scene took place on large, dark, mirrorlike tiles that made the performers’ floor reflections vivid, its atmosphere became palatial. I found myself thinking of the main dancer as Cleopatra, and the others as Isis and Charmian. Each time the two courtiers would meet midstage, they looked at each other, as if to say, “Now is plainly not the moment to bother Madam.”Yet this little drama led nowhere. Instead, it was followed by a group arm-swinging sequence that had a connective dance rhythm. (This sequence in turn recalled an earlier arm-swinging sequence that had been briefly riveting in its demonstration of just how far arm swinging can make a dancer lean back and, especially, forward.) Soon, Part 1 ended.The highlight of Part 2 (and of the whole performance) was an ensemble for five, later six, women that fragmented out of unison into close canon. A simple-looking, back-and-forth pedestrian phrase (more arm swinging) was repeated with such precision that you began to see just how complex it actually was: the timing and placing of this foot, this heel, that arm, all in a rhythm that proved more intricate the closer you watched and analyzed. Another sequence when all six women balanced on one leg also proved absorbingly detailed, with flashes of real beauty.But Ms. Gill made us wait too long for such passages. At the end of Part 1, several minutes were occupied while we watched the tiled floor being removed, piece by piece. I thought, “Couldn’t I at least listen to some music while I watch this?” Then we did hear music (drumming with rhythms far more complex than any of the choreography), but now the lights had been switched off. When they went up again, one dancer was ready to start.'"
"'08-11-22,'0','LIMA, Peru — President Bush, confessing he already “felt a little nostalgic,” began what could be his last official overseas trip on Friday with the aim of building a broad international consensus for the regulatory reform agenda adopted by leaders of the 20 nations who attended his global economic summit meeting in Washington last week.Mr. Bush arrived in Lima for yet another financial meeting, the gathering of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, which begins Saturday. Aides said he hoped to persuade the leaders of Asia-Pacific nations, a dozen of whom did not attend last week’s summit meeting, to endorse the so-called “Washington declaration” that came out of it. In that declaration, the leaders agreed to a general framework for bolstering financial institutions in an effort to prevent another financial meltdown.The weekend jaunt — Mr. Bush is planning to be back in Washington on Sunday night — is the last scheduled foreign trip of the Bush presidency. But there is some expectation in Washington that the president could make a trip to Iraq to thank soldiers for their service.Although the nation is focused on the transition to the Obama administration, and just two months remain until Mr. Bush leaves office, his aides insist the Peru visit will be substantive. Ending North Korea’s nuclear ambitions remains high on his agenda, they say; in one sign of that, Mr. Bush slipped into a closed-door meeting with President Hu Jintao of China shortly after arriving here on Friday, appearing only briefly with Mr. Hu for a photo opportunity that lasted seven seconds, his only public appearance here on Friday.Dana M. Perino, the White House press secretary, said afterward that Mr. Bush opened the meeting by telling Mr. Hu that he “felt a little nostalgic,” given that this was their last meeting as heads of state.She said Mr. Bush urged Mr. Hu to work toward a formal “verification protocol,” by which the United States, China and other nations that are engaged in the so-called six-party talks with North Korea could verify that it was living up to its promises to dismantle its nuclear weapons program. North Korea announced last week that it would bar international nuclear inspectors from taking soil and nuclear waste samples, considered crucial to determining the extent of its program.'"
"'08-11-22,'0','Irwin C. Gunsalus, who discovered the vitaminlike substance lipoic acid, which has been used as a successful treatment for chronic liver disease, and one of the active forms of vitamin B6, essential in metabolism, died Oct. 25 at his home in Andalusia, Ala. He was 96.The cause was congestive heart failure, said his daughter C. K. Gunsalus of Urbana, Ill.Dr. Gunsalus, a nutritional biochemist who was long associated with the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, also led genetic-engineering research as an assistant secretary general of the United Nations.Along with Lester J. Reed of the University of Texas, Mr. Gunsalus was granted a patent on lipoic acid in 1962. His work at the University of Illinois led, in the 1970s, to the use at other medical institutions of lipoic acid to treat chronic liver disease, and more recently to the experimental treatment of pancreatic and other cancers.Lipoic acid is found naturally in a variety of organ meats, including kidney, heart and liver, and in potatoes, broccoli and spinach. It is proposed as a dietary supplement to prevent or delay conditions like Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s diseases, but its efficacy has yet to be proved conclusively.Trained as a bacteriologist and searching, in the early 1950s, for essential growth factors in the digestive system bacterium Enterococcus, Dr. Gunsalus discovered chemical forms of lipoic acid, including lipoate, which he called pyruvate oxidation factor, as well as one of the B6 (pyridoxine) vitamins, now called pyridoxal phosphate.'"
"'08-11-22,'0','You know who else is an unsecured creditor? You, if you are in possession of a gift card. And you may be right to feel pretty insecure.Just to put the numbers that we’re talking about in perspective, the TowerGroup, a research and advisory firm, projects that $59.9 billion will be spent on gift cards linked to a specific restaurant or retailer this year.That compares with $70 billion that consumers spent on the cards last year. This is the first year that spending actually went down since 2001, when gift cards became widely available, said Brian Riley, a senior analyst with TowerGroup.Spending on gift cards from financial institutions, like MasterCard or Visa, is expected to rise, however, to $28.5 billion from $27 billion, TowerGroup said.“People have become more cautious” in buying retailer gift cards, Mr. Riley said, “and they should be.”Just this year, consumers lost about $100 million in gift cards that they could not use when major retailers went out of business, Mr. Riley said.The trouble is, there is no standardized procedure for handling gift cards after a Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing. The store does not necessarily shut down. Nor does it automatically stop taking — or for that matter, selling — gift cards. But it can.Take these three recent examples:¶ When the Sharper Image filed for bankruptcy protection in February, customers were told it would not accept outstanding gift cards. Then the company agreed to redeem them, but only as sort of a discount coupon if customers bought a certain amount of merchandise. Mr. Riley said consumers ended up losing about $60 million in Sharper Image gift cards.¶ To redeem your gift card at Linens ’n Things depends on when it was bought. A spokesman for the company responsible for selling the inventory and closing the 371 Linens ’n Things stores said that no cards should have been sold after Oct. 17, the day the going-out-of-business sale began. If you bought one before that, you can still use it — if you can still find an open store. You cannot use it online.¶ Many consumers have been worried about Circuit City, which entered bankruptcy protection this month, but a Circuit City spokesman, Jim Babb, said that the company would continue to sell and accept gift cards, regardless of when they were bought.Greg Daugherty, executive editor of Consumer Reports, said his organization has “never been big on gift cards, and the collapse of retailers is just one more reason.” Even if a company continues to accept the cards after going bankrupt, local stores may close, making it harder for the consumer to use them, he said.In September, Consumers Union, along with the Public Interest Research Group, the Consumer Federation of America and the National Consumer Law Center wrote to the Federal Trade Commission asking for greater protection for consumers with retail gift cards.“Currently, unused gift card funds are treated as a debt,” the letter states. “The retailer may or may not request the court to allow it to continue to accept its gift cards. The consumer is left without the ability to use the card if the retailer does not make this request or if the court denies the retailers’ request. The consumer may be left with one option, which is the cumbersome task of filing a claim as an unsecured creditor in the bankruptcy proceeding to obtain the value on their gift card.”For a $50 gift card? I don’t think so.A spokesman for the Federal Trade Commission said it did not comment on such letters.Bankruptcy aside, a large part of the problem is that the accounting practices regarding the sale and redemption of gift cards by retailers are not standardized, Mr. Riley said.In addition, companies make millions of dollars selling cards that are never or only partially used.Mr. Daugherty said that a recent telephone holiday survey by Consumer Reports found that 66 percent of respondents said they planned to buy gift cards, up from 62 percent last year.But of the 62 percent who received gift cards in 2007, some 25 percent said they were still sitting in drawers somewhere, unredeemed. And of that 25 percent, more than half have two or more gift cards.And here’s another reason that retailers love gift cards: In the Consumer Reports survey, 58 percent of consumers said they spent more than the gift card amount when they used it.The Internet has rushed in to address the gift card dilemma. There are sites to swap and sell them, as well, of course, to buy them online. And after the wave of bankruptcies, some sites, like Leveragecard.com and giftcardrescue.com, are offering sort of a bankruptcy protection.Leveragecard.com, for example, which sells more than 250 brands of gift cards, allows members to swap cards, and it keeps track of the mileage and rewards cards of members. Membership is free and there are no additional fees to buy the cards electronically; if shipped via post, there is a $1.99 charge.After a number of retailers went bankrupt, Leveragecard.com instituted a policy allowing customers who had bought gift cards from its Web site to trade them in for another retailer’s card, said Jennifer Mathe, chief operating officer and co-founder of the year-old site.Customers must notify Leveragecard.com within 30 days of a company’s bankruptcy that they want to make the exchange and must do it within 60 days of the retailer’s filing for bankruptcy and only if the company stops selling gift cards.Kwame Kuadey, founder of giftcardrescue.com, said that if a company goes bankrupt, he will reimburse any unspent balance on cards that customers bought on his site within a year of purchase.The final advice I received is that if you do get gift cards this holiday, don’t let them languish. Use them quickly to avoid any problems. And you won’t forget them.I have never liked giving gift cards, finding them impersonal and boring. I enjoy shopping for presents, and when my nieces and nephews were small, I loved buying cute little outfits, cool picture books and funky toys.But as everyone has grown older, my idea of a cute outfit seems curiously out of step with a teenager’s, and a funky toy is more likely to require software than batteries.This holiday season, therefore, I guess I will give out something I will simply call historical presidential portraits, available in easily foldable sizes.'"
"'08-11-22,'0','The debate over subsidiary rights has intensified in the past decade, as an increasing number of regional and local theaters, festivals and even workshops have begun demanding a slice of the subsidiary-rights pie.“Let’s say a young playwright gets his work premiered at Podunk Holler Rep,” said the agent Peter Franklin, whose client roster includes Mr. Lucas, Edward Albee and Paula Vogel. “They give him a standard contract, nonnegotiable — and they take 2.5 percent. Then the play goes on to Mid-City Rep in a major city. So we have to peel off another 5 percent for them. Then the play makes it to New York Institutional Rep and they want an even bigger chunk” — usually between 10 and 40 percent.Playwrights are especially concerned that top asking rates at some of New York’s prestigious nonprofits, not only the Roundabout but also Manhattan Theater Club, have climbed to 40 percent, the rate commanded by commercial productions.“Nonprofits have looked to the commercial theater and said, ‘If they get 40 percent, why shouldn’t we?’ ” Mr. Nelson said. “But the mission of a nonprofit theater is in part to produce new work. That is what it does — it’s not doing something extraordinary. And it is on the basis of that mission that the theater raises money from donors.”Mr. Nelson drew attention to the subsidiary-rights issue last year in a much-talked-about speech at a conference sponsored by the Off Broadway Alliance of Resident Theaters/New York. When a copy of the speech reached Michael Ritchie, artistic director of Center Theater Group in Los Angeles, which includes the Mark Taper Forum, Mr. Ritchie decided to act.“We did an assessment of what the total revenue from subsidiary rights meant to our operating budget, and of what — if the playwrights were getting that money directly — it would mean to them,” Mr. Ritchie said. After reviewing that study, Center Theater Group announced that it would join Lincoln Center Theater as the country’s second major nonprofit theater to take no subsidiary theatrical rights from authors. (Center Theater Group does retain a percentage of the playwright’s movie rights.)The announcement was heartening to John Weidman, president of the Dramatists Guild of America. Over the past year Mr. Weidman and the guild have initiated a series of conversations with artistic directors of nonprofit theaters about reducing or eliminating their reliance on subsidiary rights. His central theme: amounts that are a tiny fraction of a nonprofit’s budget can pay a struggling playwright’s rent.The young playwright Sarah Ruhl (“The Clean House,” “Eurydice”) sees subsidiary rights as one factor driving emerging playwrights to Hollywood. “If you’re talking about the difference between $18,000 a year or $30,000 a year, that’s the difference between being able to support yourself by playwriting — or not,” Ms. Ruhl said. “A nonprofit theater could raise that $12,000 from a corporation or a donor. A playwright typically doesn’t have that luxury.”Although the majority of plays generate scant revenue from subsidiary rights, Mr. Breglio said, nonprofit theaters are concerned about “protecting themselves if they have a hit” on the scale of “A Chorus Line” or “Rent.”Mr. Weidman, for one, is skeptical of the “Chorus Line” argument. He notes that nonprofit theaters are already protected by a separate contractual clause that guarantees them a portion of the profits if their shows transfer to commercial theaters. He worries more about protecting emerging playwrights.“There are more stage-worthy plays than there are stages, so playwrights are very vulnerable,” Mr. Weidman said. “They’ll say, ‘I’d rather see my play produced and give away 40 percent of it than not see my play produced at all.’ ”Lynn Nottage was one such writer. She was thrilled when the Roundabout produced her play “Intimate Apparel” to acclaim and awards in 2004; it became the most produced new play in the country for a few years.“I thought that given the play’s popularity, I’d be able to live off it for a year or two,” Ms. Nottage said. But by the time the play reached New York, she had relinquished all but “about 30 percent” of her own royalties. At the time, she had to take other work to make ends meet.Ms. Nottage said that she believed that the Roundabout’s production “brought people into the theater to see the play.” Yet to her a high-caliber New York premiere is only one part of the equation.“I got exposure, but a lot of plays get that same exposure, and they haven’t made the same journey that ‘Intimate Apparel’ has,” she said. “At the end of the day, it has to have something to do with the piece itself.”'"
"'08-11-22,'0','OTTAWA — Prices in Canada fell by 1 percent on an unadjusted basis from September to October, the largest such decline in 49 years, Statistics Canada reported on Friday.But the report provoked a mixed response from economists about the prospects for deflation in Canada.Accounting for seasonal variances, the Canadian government agency said, the inflation rate was 2.6 percent in October, compared with 3.4 percent a month earlier. The core inflation rate, a measure that excludes several items with volatile prices, was 1.7 percent.Among the most significant reductions was a 9 percent decline in the cost of buying or leasing a car. It followed a 9.3 percent fall in September.Unlike in the United States, in Canada, consumer credit for large purchases remains generally available, and auto and light truck sales rose by 1.5 percent last month.'"
"'08-11-22,'0','“That’s the magic of Davis Cup,” said Emilio Sánchez Vicario, the captain for Spanish. “Argentina had a strong start and a big success for their team; the people were really emotional. And it was the same way at the start of Juan’s match. But I think Feliciano just played one to one and a half hours of great tennis from there. I think he was close to perfection.”A team needs three victories in the final to secure the Cup, the 108-year-old trophy that represents the summit of team tennis. But Spain has a strong doubles team in López and Fernando Verdasco, who are expected to face Nalbandian and Agustín Calleri on Saturday. With del Potro’s physical condition a potential issue, a Spanish upset is no longer unthinkable.“I think for the final and the show it’s better for it to be tied after one day,” Sánchez Vicario said. “I think it’s good for everyone that we’re in this situation. It creates more emotion, and we don’t know what will happen.”When Argentina and Spain advanced to this final, the flashy left-hander the Argentines were most concerned with was not López, but Rafael Nadal, the world’s No. 1 player. Nadal’s prowess on clay led to the Argentines’ decision to play this final on an indoor hardcourt, but he withdrew from this final because of tendinitis in his right knee.López took control of the match despite failing to break the 6-foot-5 Del Potro’s serve in the first three sets. But López also has an excellent serve as well as a now-unusual style, which features lots of crisply chipped one-handed backhands and forays to the net.The match did not turn for good until the fourth set, when del Potro winced in pain and grabbed at the inside of his upper right leg after losing the opening point at 2-3.He walked gingerly to his chair, where he was surrounded by five men, three of them members of the Argentine staff. After a three-minute injury timeout, del Potro returned to the court and was clearly not the same player, hesitating to push off with his right leg and losing the game on a double fault.López lost only one point in his final two service games to finish off a 3-hour-and-19-minute upset.“I gave it my best and fought until the end,” del Potro said. “But I played a guy who played better than me and grabbed his opportunities.”Del Potro said he had not yet determined the extent of his leg injury, which could force Argentina’s captain, Alberto Mancini, to replace him in Sunday’s reverse singles.But Argentina still has one player in top form: Nalbandian is now 17-4 in Davis Cup singles play.'"
"'08-11-22,'0','This week in the Your Money column, I created an e-mail focus group of sorts to air a proposal I had for changing the way we give gifts.Though I didn’t ask for specific gift ideas that might be less expensive but more meaningful, several people sent them anyway. There were enough good ones that I’m passing them along here.ORNAMENTS Some families have declared a moratorium on adults giving gifts to other adults, in an effort to put a limit on the obligations each family member feels. Another strategy might be to still give those gifts, but to pick a specific category that doesn’t require great expense and still has great meaning.Megan Holding, a college friend of mine who lives in Needham, Mass., and her siblings exchange ornaments each year. She, her family and her three sisters’ families are no longer all together for the holiday every year. “So I love that when we put up the tree, I know I have a bit of each of them on our tree and they each have a bit of us,” she said in an e-mail message.WEBCAMS To spur on virtual gatherings, Angela Keller, a producer at Hotwire’s Travel Ticker newsletter in , is considering asking everyone in her family to give webcams this year. “This will allow me to watch my nieces lose their first tooth in , gawk at my mom’s infamous Christmas lights and decorations in Fargo, N.D., and see my brother in his cap and gown after his college graduation in Bellingham, Wash., all while sitting on my couch in San Francisco,” she wrote.DOLLAR STORES One part of Dana Treister’s birthday routine with her young grandchildren in each year could be easily adapted to the holidays. She takes them to a giant dollar store and allows them to select one item for each year that they’ve been alive.

"'08-11-22,'0','“It’s completely useless,” Mr. Dorjee said of negotiating with the Chinese. “There’s no point. We have been played.”Chinese officials now say in blunt terms that they will not accept the Dalai Lama’s demand for greater Tibetan autonomy, and have suggested that they would rather wait for the 73-year-old spiritual leader to die rather than reach an accord and allow him to return to Tibet.One of the biggest causes célèbres in the world, taken up by actors and rock stars, the movement is also losing international support because of China’s growing economic influence.It is time to adopt desperate measures, some Tibetans here say. At the conclusion of this week’s meeting, a majority of the 581 delegates could very well recommend to the Dalai Lama and the government in exile that they start a formal independence movement — a situation that would alarm Chinese leaders while also confirming their long-held suspicions that exiled Tibetan leaders would never settle for anything but separation from China.“We have totally surrendered before the people and let them express their views,” Samdhong Rinpoche, prime minister of the exile government, said in an interview. “Obviously we’ve ruled out the violence approach. Other than that, anything is possible.”The other big issue looming over the conference is the question of the Dalai Lama’s successor. The Dalai Lama, winner of the Nobel Peace Prize, has suffered bouts of ill health recently. Some Tibetans are now suggesting that he could break tradition and appoint his own successor rather than wait for his reincarnation to be discovered after his death. Many Tibetans fear that China will hijack the process of locating his successor, as it did with the Panchen Lama in 1995, unless the Dalai Lama uses his influence to anoint a new spiritual leader before he dies.The conference itself is being interpreted by many as the Dalai Lama’s attempt to wean the movement off his guidance — something that might have been unthinkable just years earlier.“I see this meeting as a symbolic transition from a Tibetan movement led by His Holiness to a Tibetan movement led by Tibetan people,” said Lobsang Sangay, a research fellow at Harvard Law School.The Tibet issue has reached a critical point for the exiles following a mass uprising of Tibetans across western China last spring. Protests and riots in which ethnic Han Chinese were killed prompted a harsh crackdown by the Chinese government. Envoys of the Dalai Lama and Chinese officials held two further rounds of talks in a series of negotiations that began in 2002, but the Chinese announced last week that they would never make any concessions on genuine autonomy for the six million people in Tibetan regions of China.Robbie Barnett, a scholar of Tibet at Columbia University, said the Dalai Lama’s purpose in calling for the conference last September was probably to allow Tibetans to vent their frustrations while seeking unified support for his “middle way” strategy. But the recent hard-line statements by the Chinese could push moderate Tibetans in a more radical direction.The Dalai Lama has not taken part in the conference. He said he wanted to remain neutral in the discussions, though his sister is attending, as are his envoys. He is expected to hear the recommendations of the delegates over the weekend, before Parliament discusses them.In some discussions by committees at the six-day meeting, abbots who fled decades ago from Tibet debated the finer points of reincarnation doctrine with younger exiles who have never set foot on the roof of the world.The most pressing question, though, has been whether the movement as a whole should call for Tibetan independence and abandon the Dalai Lama’s approach.“The bottom line is every Tibetan would wish and aspire for independence,” said Mr. Dorjee, the officer of the Youth Congress. “It’s just that the Dalai Lama is not seeking independence, the exile government is not seeking independence.”Though rare, there is talk among some young Tibetans of using violence. “There are so many views now,” Mr. Dorjee said.Jamyang Norbu, a prominent Tibetan writer who lives most of the year in Tennessee, gave a speech here before the start of the conference on the concept of rangzen. A flier seen throughout the streets of Dharamsala says: “Let’s Talk — Why? How? When? Rangzen.”“The Dalai Lama’s middle way depends on China democratizing,” Mr. Norbu said while unwinding early on Thursday evening in his cottage. “That premise has so far not materialized in any way and has even gotten worse.”An independence movement, he said, would unite the exile community, keep Tibet in the headlines and increase pressure on the Chinese government. Supporters would organize economic boycotts of China. Young Tibetans in the West would go door to door explaining the cause.“It’s a kind of peaceful guerrilla warfare,” he said.Mr. Sangay, at Harvard, said he took a survey of his 34-person committee after he was elected chairman. The members were divided, with 40 percent for independence, 40 percent for autonomy and the rest in the middle. “They’re the swing voters, like Ohio, Pennsylvania and Florida,” he said of the last group.For his part, Mr. Sangay, who has organized six conferences between Tibetans and Chinese scholars, said he still supported dialogue.“There’s no basis for optimism where China is concerned, but I’m always hopeful that the good conscience of the people will come out,” he said. “If you choose nonviolence, the only path you’re left with is dialogue.”On Wednesday, the Dalai Lama’s elder brother, Gyalo Thondup, made a similar point at a rare news conference. He met with reporters to relate how Deng Xiaoping, the former paramount leader of China, had told him in Beijing in 1979 that “except for independence, all issues can be discussed.” Chinese officials today have betrayed that promise, he said, by denying that Mr. Deng ever said it and refusing to negotiate on autonomy.Still, Mr. Thondup, 80, said, “It’s essential for Tibetan people not to lose hope in pleading for our rights to the Chinese government.”Whether that is the future, or whether it lies in adopting a more radical approach, Tibetans now have to decide who will lead their struggle. Several committees are discussing the possibility of the current Dalai Lama naming a successor. “I personally don’t know whether this is acceptable according to religious traditions,” said Samdhong Rinpoche, who, besides serving as prime minister, is also a monk.Other people have talked of a greater political role for the young Karmapa Lama, the third-ranking spiritual leader. There is also the widely held thought that the next Dalai Lama should devote himself solely to spiritual concerns and turn all political matters over to the elected leaders.“One cannot do without a personality like the Dalai Lama,” Mr. Sangay said. “But we can’t avoid a linear movement toward a modern, democratic system.”'"

The broader Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index swung 6.32 percent higher, or 47.59 points, to 800.03. The Nasdaq composite index gained 68.23 points, or 5.18 percent, to 1,384.35.Still, Friday’s gains were not enough to wipe away the losses of the last two days, which brought Wall Street to its lowest levels since 1997. The Dow ended the week down 5 percent, and the S.& P. 500 was 8 percent lower.And with jobless numbers rising, corporate profits plummeting and Citigroup teetering, no one was willing to say that the worst of the economic crisis had passed.“This is an environment like having a migraine headache every day,” said David Joy, chief market strategist of RiverSource Investments. “You know someday it’ll end, but you don’t know when, and the doctors can’t help you.”No major economic reports, which have jolted markets all week, were released Friday, and the Congressional lame-duck session paused as automakers retooled their case for a bailout.Then the news of Mr. Geithner leaked out, and shares raced skyward.A bounce in the price of commodities like metals, oil and gold after months of declines helped to push up shares in basic-materials companies. The aluminum manufacturer Alcoa led gains among the Dow’s 30 stocks, closing 23 percent higher, at $8.44. Mining companies posted double-digit gains.Crude oil prices, which retreated in early trading, settled 51 cents higher, at $49.93. Energy shares, which have tumbled 50 percent this year, rebounded on Friday, with Exxon Mobil, Marathon, Sunoco and Conoco Phillips ending more than 10 percent higher. The average price for gasoline fell below $2 a gallon nationwide, according to AAA, the auto association.But as demand for goods continues to crumble and factories scale back, analysts expect that the price of commodities will not recover until the larger economy stabilizes. Friday’s lift in prices could have been little more than bargain-hunting, they said.“We’re going to have to see the light at the end of the tunnel before we see convincing sustainable moves,” said Bart Melek, a commodities analyst at BMO Capital Markets.Battered technology stocks, which are down more than 50 percent since the beginning of the year, rode the rally on Friday. But shares of Dell fell 5 percent, to $9.30, after the computer maker reported that its third-quarter sales had dropped.Shares of Citigroup also lagged amid growing uncertainty about the fate of the bank. The company’s stock dropped 20 percent, to $3.77, after the bank denied reports that it would auction units, or put itself up for sale.Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase were the only two Dow components to close lower on Friday. JP Morgan fell 66 cents, to $22.72.As buyers dipped their toes into equity markets, the price of safe-haven government debt ebbed. The Treasury’s 10-year bill fell 1 20/32, to 104 22/32. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 3.2 percent from 3.01, a record low, late Thursday.Many analysts still expect Wall Street’s current downward trend to continue.“There doesn’t seem to be a market direction but down,” said Eric Ross, director of United States research at Canaccord Adams. “It’s not that one sector is leading, one sector is lagging.

If the value of your house has dropped but your local government is still taxing you based upon the earlier, higher assessed value, consider filing a grievance at the next opportunity. Based upon recent comparable sales and appraisals, it is possible that the assessed value of your house, and therefore your taxes, should be reduced.Q In 2006 I invested in a property in California in hopes of joining in on the real estate boom. Though I entered toward the end of it, I am now fearing what will happen when my Option ARM loan matures and payments jump nearly $1,500 more per month in the next two to three years. What has made it more dire is the fact that I have gone back to school, and my expendable income is already strapped. With all the talk of assistance programs, mortgage negotiations and foreclosure prevention, where could I start to get this same help to make sure that I don’t lose my home? -Posted by RobDear Rob,We assume this question relates to relief for the mortgage on your primary residence. (Lenders are much more likely to consider mortgage relief with respect to a primary residence as opposed to an investment property or second home.) The best place to start is to contact your lender about restructuring your mortgage. Option ARM mortgages, in which monthly payments in the early years are kept low and then often increase drastically (and which often result in an increase in the loan balance), have been a particular focus of the mortgage relief effort. Your lender may have a loan modification program in place for Option ARM mortgages. Such programs may provide for a lowering of the interest rate, extending the term, deferring principal payments and/or converting the loan to a fixed interest rate.The information above has been prepared with the assistance of Cullen and Dykman LLP. Please feel free to call the Catholic Charities Help Line at 888-744-7900 for a referral to one of our offices to discuss other ways we might be able to help.The questions below were answered Dr. William Weisberg:Q: Does it ever make sense to give up your house, and if so, when? If you are still able to make the mortgage payments but it’s difficult, and you owe more than the house is now worth, how would you recommend proceeding? How does foreclosure affect your credit history? Not good, I know, but how does it compare to say, bankruptcy? -Posted by SabinaDear Sabina: It sounds as though you might be one of so many people who are now facing very difficult decisions about holding on to a home. We recommend contacting the NY State Banking Department at (877) 226-5697 to get a list of housing counseling agencies in your neighborhood approved by the federal agency HUD (Housing and Urban Development). If you are current on your mortgage but can foresee future financial hardship then the best place to start is with a housing counselor. The counselor can advocate on your behalf with your lender to request a loan modification or another workout plan. We cannot answer whether it makes sense to give up your home. In order to give you a more concrete answer we would need to consider other factors including the loan to value ratio, long term affordability, and how you feel about staying in the home. A foreclosure does remain on your credit report for 7 years.Q: I have repeatedly asked Citimortgage to allow me to lower my fixed interest rate but there are two obstacles. First CItimortgage does not want to and second, if I were to try to refinance, NYC has a heft morgagage tax which would ad a disincentive and huge penalty for doing so. Has anyone confronted Mayor Bloomberg about waiving the city mortgage tax for those to need to refinance in these difficult times? And why do the banks who created this mess in the first place, have the option of not allowing folks to minimize their mortgage payments when the mortgages were largely incurred due to their greed and rising adjustable rates etc. -Posted by Helene SchwarzenbergerDear Ms. Schwarzenberger, I am sorry to hear about your frustration. Thank you for your questions. In this situation, we also recommend that you contact the NY State Banking Department at (877) 226-5697 who will provide you with a list of local HUD approved counseling agencies in your neighborhood. At Children’s Aid, we work with more than 100,000 children and families annually, and each situation is different. It is very difficult to give one-size-fits-all advice. This is particularly true with the housing situations we encounter. We want you to find the solution that will be best for you. Once connected with one of these agencies, a counselor can advocate on your behalf with your lender, in this case Citimortgage.You also raise an interesting question about reducing mortgage taxes for people who need to refinance during this financial crisis in order to keep their homes. There have been many tax and foreclosure prevention proposals, but we are not aware of this specific question being addressed in the public arena. If you wish to offer a recommendation to City Hall, one option is to call 3-1-1. They are set up to log and transmit policy recommendations to the Mayor’s Office.Q:On 11//08 the New York Times published a story titled The Wrong Mortgage Derails a Mother’s Plans about Christina Natale who lost her home in a short sale and then was helped by the Children’s Aid Society to relocate to an apartment. The article reports that Natale purchased her home in 2006 for $385,000, making a down payment of $185,000, and that she then lost the entire down payment in the short sale two years later. That the down payment was really *lost* seems close to impossible! It sounds to me like someone involved in the short sale stole all or most of her down-payment. Can’t someone look into this and help Natale? -Posted by wendy millerDear Ms. Miller: Thank you so much for your concern for Ms. Natale and her family. When we, at The Children’s Aid Society, first spoke with her we were also concerned about her financial situation and how she had lost the value in her home after providing a substantial down payment to purchase it. She did have a lawyer working with her to make sure everything was above board, and the actual finances were more complicated than might be apparent. As was reported in the Times story, she had refinanced more than once, and did not have as much equity in the house when she sold it as when she originally purchased it.A short sale is one of the options available to a homeowner that may make sense if the borrower owes more than the house is worth or has very little equity and wants to avoid a foreclosure. At the time of a short sale there are a number of factors that play a part in determining what, if anything, a borrower can walk away with. One has to take into account significant arrears, late fees, attorney’s fees if the short sale takes place during the final stages of foreclosure and what the house is appraised for at the time of sale. In the case of Ms. Natale, this was her best option at the time.Although Ms. Natale did not walk away with a profit, the key is she did not walk away with any debt. Being debt-free and able to move on with her life and take care of her children was extremely important to her. And, thanks to the generous donors to the Times Neediest Fund, we were able to assist her to establish a new household for her family without the burden and stress of new debt from moving expenses, a broker’s fee, and security deposit. It is painful to see a hard-working parent, someone who is trying to do the right thing, lose a home. The kindness and help that come from the broader community cannot take away all the pain that so many will suffer during this financial crisis but it can offer an individual family the hope of a fresh start.'"
"'08-11-23,'0','That is Mr. Bush’s fault. His decision to authorize the torture of detainees has made it highly unlikely that the evidence collected at Gitmo and the C.I.A.’s illegal prisons around the world would stand up in a real court.In closing down Guantánamo, there are some basic requirements: The prisoners must be dealt with as openly as possible. Those who are charged here must stand trial in federal courts, not the tribunals created by the disastrous Military Commissions Act of 2006.It would compound the disaster if, as some suggest, Congress tried to create a new system combining military and civilian justice. We have seen what happens when the government creates special systems to deal with special classes of prisoners.Human Rights Watch has offered a good template for closing Guantánamo. It includes:SET A DATE TO CLOSE THE PRISON That announcement would send a powerful signal that the new administration has rejected Mr. Bush’s abusive and unlawful policies. It would make other countries more likely to cooperate. The taint of Guantánamo is so great that right now even close allies will not consider resettling prisoners who should be set free because they committed no crimes of any kind. There may be at least 60 of these detainees at Gitmo. Selected countries might also be willing to take back their own nationals to stand trial.BEGIN A TRANSPARENT REVIEW OF DETAINEES There are about 250 detainees at Guantánamo Bay. Human Rights Watch sensibly proposes creating a task force run by the Justice Department with input from the Departments of State and Defense and the director of national intelligence to separate out those who may be truly guilty of terrorist acts — a minority — from the larger population who either committed much more minor crimes or no crimes at all.REPATRIATE DETAINEES WHO ARE NOT TO BE TRIED This must be done carefully. There are believed to be 30 to 50 detainees from places like Algeria and Libya who have justified fears of being abused or tortured if they are sent home. The Obama administration should provide these prisoners with advance notice of plans to repatriate them and give them a chance to contest those plans.Prisoners with a credible fear of abuse cannot be sent to that fate. They will have to be sent to other countries to live. The best way for the United States to get other governments to cooperate is to accept some detainees for settlement in this country.TRY THE REST IN FEDERAL COURTS Americans will hear from former members of the Bush administration and supporters of its system of injustice that the federal courts cannot handle these cases because they involve sensitive secrets, or that terrorism is not appropriately handled as a law-enforcement issue.Since Sept. 11, 2001, the federal courts have successfully prosecuted about 100 terrorism cases, and the courts deal routinely with national secrets. The real reason Mr. Bush and his team avoided the federal courts for the Gitmo detainees was that the evidence in so many of these cases is wafer-thin or unusable because it was obtained through coercion and torture.The world saw more proof of that last week, when Col. Stephen Henley, a military judge at Guantánamo, refused to admit evidence obtained through torture or coercion at the trial of Mohammed Jawad, an Afghan national who is one of the few prisoners at Guantánamo who has been charged and put on trial. Evidence that cannot pass muster in Guantánamo’s kangaroo courts is certainly not going to be admitted by a civilian judge in a duly constituted court of law.The Jawad case has become emblematic of everything that is wrong with Guantánamo Bay: he was captured in Afghanistan at the age of 16 or 17 and thrown into indefinite detention without hope of eventual release because he allegedly threw a grenade at two American servicemen and an Afghan interpreter. The prosecutor resigned in September, saying he could not ethically proceed, and the judge threw out Mr. Jawad’s confession because it had been tortured out of him by Afghan interrogators.Does this mean that truly dangerous men will be set free, to go back to plotting more attacks against America? No. But it will require smart legal thinking by the new administration.Take the case of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed. It is obvious that the confession he made to plotting the 9/11 bombings will not hold up in court. It was obtained through torture. But this prisoner is a suspect in numerous other terrorist attacks, including the murder of the journalist Daniel Pearl and the attack on the U.S.S. Cole. There is an existing 1996 indictment against him for a plot to blow up 12 United States-bound commercial airliners. The evidence in that case was obtained, we presume, legally.It may be that compromises of this kind will have to be made in other cases as well. It is understandable that some Americans will find that less than satisfying. But it is important to remember that this is the price of Mr. Bush’s incompetent and lawless conduct of the war against terrorism. It is a price worth paying to restore the rule of law and this country’s good name.'"
"'08-11-23,'0','“You can’t just expect a guy that’s a good player to want to come to a team because it’s got a building,” Walsh said after trading the Knicks’ two best players, Jamal Crawford and Zach Randolph, on Friday. “There has to be a good team put around whoever that is and to be attractive to the entire free-agent situation.”Or, as Walsh said Saturday night, “This is just the first step.”It is a tricky proposition, shedding salaries and conserving cap space while accumulating talent, staying competitive and regaining the league’s respect.The Knicks have some advantages in the recruiting process: a huge news media market; an immensely popular coach, Mike D’Antoni; and an arena that breathes history. The Garden is scheduled to undergo a $500 million renovation by the time James is expected to start his free-agent tour. Walsh cleared enough cap space that he may be able to sign two superstars in 2010. He could make a bid for James and Toronto’s Chris Bosh, or Miami’s Dwyane Wade and Phoenix’s Amare Stoudemire. Any pair could make the Knicks instant contenders.There will be other intriguing options. The list of free agents that year could include Dirk Nowitzki, Josh Howard, Joe Johnson, Tracy McGrady, Luis Scola, Michael Redd, Tyson Chandler, Jermaine O’Neal, Carlos Boozer, Mehmet Okur, Hedo Turkoglu, Mike Miller, Steve Nash, Marcus Camby, Ray Allen and Manu Ginóbili.So the Knicks could miss on the grand prize, James, and still come away with two or three franchise-changing players.This plan is not unique to the Knicks. Nearly half the league’s 30 teams are on track to have major cap space in 2010 — including the teams that now employ James, Bosh and Wade.Under N.B.A. rules, James, Wade and Bosh can all earn millions more by staying with their current teams. But competitively, the issue is basic: Who offers the best supporting cast and the chance for a championship — the Cavaliers or the Knicks? The Heat or the Raptors? The Detroit Pistons or the Phoenix Suns?“The object is to be able to put together a title-contending team here,” Walsh said. “And there’s a lot of work to be done.”While Walsh calibrates the payroll for 2010, D’Antoni will be charged with making the Knicks respectable in the near term. That task became tougher when Crawford and Randolph were traded. For the first time in years, the Knicks were looking like a team unified in purpose and in spirit. The trades were a morale buster, and a stark reminder that every player is disposable.The newest Knicks — Al Harrington, Tim Thomas and Cuttino Mobley — said all the right things Saturday. “We have a nice little nucleus that we’re going to make a run for it,” Mobley said.But Harrington, Thomas and Mobley were acquired as much for their short contracts as for their talent. They would have to be purged to make room for James. The same goes for most of the players here, which invites the question: If no one feels invested in the future, what incentive is there to play as a team?“It’s a tough situation,” said Malik Rose, whose contract expires next summer, “but we’re all being paid pretty well to play the game right now.” He added, “We can’t really worry about what’s going to happen in 2010.”But the Knicks took a bold step Friday toward shedding their image as a sad-sack franchise.“I think everybody’s starting to look at the Knicks as an organization that’s definitely going to be working towards a championship and trying to be back on top of basketball again,” Harrington said. “I think that’s how everybody across the league feels, and I think that in ’10 there’s going to be a lot of guys calling, trying to be part of the Knicks.”'"
"'08-11-23,'0','MAR DEL PLATA, Argentina — It has been a fine year for optimistic outsiders and their new mantra. And when the Spanish Davis Cup team arrived in this blustery resort town without Rafael Nadal and with its new leader, David Ferrer, in a funk, one of the first things the underdogs did was put a sign on the wall in their locker room that read, in English, “Yes we can.”So far, so surprisingly good.With one day remaining in this emotionally combustible final, Argentina, the home team with all the advantages, is now the home team in a vulnerable spot.Despite the absence of Nadal, the world’s No. 1 player, who is on vacation in Mauritius and is recovering from a knee injury, the Spaniards lead by 2-1 and need to win one of the two reverse singles Sunday to win their third Davis Cup title of the decade.The Spaniards took the lead Saturday with their doubles team, Feliciano López and Fernando Verdasco, rallying to defeat David Nalbandian and Agustín Calleri, 5-7, 7-5, 7-6 (5), 6-3.Argentina’s shining goal of winning its first Davis Cup has dimmed. Its top-ranked player, Juan Martín del Potro, has a strained groin that contributed to his loss to López in singles Friday.

"'08-11-23,'0','These days, a “once-in-a-lifetime” $19 million estate merits only a quarter-page ad. Sometimes, along with the reverential tones, there is something of a jarring Crazy Eddie note. As the ad for the Tudor with five bedrooms, five fireplaces, five full baths and three half baths (plus staff quarters!) reads: “At $2,900,000 this romantic 1920s estate (flanked by two gated entrances) is being ‘given away!’ ”Increasingly, people are coming to see that some of these prices really were insane. Chris Fountain, a local real estate agent whose blog, christopherfountain.wordpress.com, keeps a jaundiced eye on the market, figures there are at least 88 spec houses on the market in the Greenwich area, 53 of them listed for more than $5 million.Total sales fell by a third more than a year ago, most of them before the carnage on Wall Street began in earnest.“In October, nine single-family houses went to contract. Last year there were 33, and that’s not a great year. Basically, nothing’s selling,” Mr. Fountain said. That’s not much business for about 1,000 real estate agents.HE knows of one house that was listed at $28 million and sold for $13.75 million, and says that it is becoming increasingly common for large houses to sell for 30 percent off the initial asking price.And there is something a little surreal in the mix of stratospheric Greenwich real estate and distress-sale atmospherics. So, for instance, there’s a brand new stone-and-shingle seven-bedroom “evergreen lodge” that was originally listed for $9.975 million and is now offered for $6.795 million. The door’s open. Leaves have blown into a hallway. There’s a water-shutoff notice on the door. A trash-hauling bin is outside, but it looks as if construction halted months ago, with the interior 90 percent finished.“Unless there’s interest, it’s silly to continue,” said Janet Silver, who is listed as the agent for the house and is a part owner. “We started when the market was hot, and it’s a great location, but it takes a long time to build a 13,000-square-foot house, and we just missed the market. If someone’s interested, we’re obviously happy to hear any and all offers.”Worse, as noted on Mr. Fountain’s blog, is a house on Round Hill Road, one of Greenwich’s premier addresses, where construction has long since stopped. The developer pleaded guilty to mortgage and insurance fraud, and some lender is on the hook for $6.2 million for a shell that will probably have to be torn down.And it might not be the only one.Bad times won’t last forever. Greenwich has seen tough real estate markets before, and it’s an item of faith in town that Greenwich is the last market to go down and the first to come back.But leaving aside how many Wall Street zillionaires there will be in the future, more than a few people are wondering about the marketability of all those megahouses, sitting like Hummers on blocks, even when the economy comes back.“Any of the old-timers will tell you that after every boom-and-bust period, tastes in what people want change dramatically,” said Frank Farricker, a member of the Planning and Zoning Commission. “So you have a lot of these 15,000-square-foot spec houses with add-ons like 10,000-bottle wine cellars and indoor swimming pools and screening rooms. You wonder if that’s going to be so evocative of 2008 that when we come out of this, someone looking for a house will see that and say, ‘Nah, not interested.’ ”He added: “Maybe they’ll want to say, ‘Look at me, I’ve got full solar and geothermal heating.’ I’m pretty positive the next status symbol may be a big house with a zero carbon footprint.”'"
"'08-11-23,'0','LOS ANGELES — Eli Broad, the billionaire philanthropist who is one of this city’s biggest arts patrons, has offered $30 million to help rescue the financially beleaguered Museum of Contemporary Art if the museum’s trustees and other patrons also step up their donations.The offer, made in an op-ed article published Saturday in The Los Angeles Times, is the first concrete proposal to be made public since the museum disclosed this week that it was facing a financial crisis. The museum’s endowment has fallen as much as 75 percent from its high several years ago, to less than $10 million, as the museum has repeatedly dipped into its permanent funds to pay for operations, said people who had been briefed on the museum’s finances but who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak about the situation.In the article, Mr. Broad said that his Broad Art Foundation would invest $30 million “with the expectation that the museum’s board and others join in this effort to solve the institution’s financial problems.”A spokeswoman for the museum said officials there would not immediately comment on the offer. People close to the museum said that Mr. Broad had discussed the potential contribution with museum officials this week and expressed his opinion that a management change was necessary. He did not outline any such conditions in the article.Mr. Broad was a founding chairman of the Museum of Contemporary Art in 1979 and he helped to negotiate the acquisition in 1994 of what became the centerpiece of the museum’s highly regarded collection of post-World War II art, the Panza Collection.But he has been largely inactive there recently, turning his attention to the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, which in February opened the Broad Contemporary Art Museum, a $56 million facility that Mr. Broad paid for and to which he donated another $10 million for art acquisitions.'"

Then anyone with Live ID on a user’s list of contacts or “buddy list” can be invited to collaborate on a search.“You could invite your husband and mother to join you” for a trial run, Dr. Morris said — to work, for instance, on investigating topics like puppies for adoption, hybrid cars, or cooking tips for people with diabetes.People doing a joint search can divide the chores, sending half of the top results of a query to one team member and half to another, for example, to avoid duplicating work. When you sign on, a drop-down menu shows your current collaborations. Click on a topic and you’ll find automatic summaries of the team’s searches, as well as links to the pages, comments and recommendations.Team members can work synchronously, with everyone online at the same time, exchanging chat messages that are shown at the bottom of the browser page. They can also work on their own. “A group member can log in at any time,” Dr. Morris said. “Because of the automatic storing of group information in a shared repository, you can see what everyone has done while you were offline. The data base is always available.”The system also has a “peek and follow” feature that lets a group member watch another member search. This could be especially helpful for novice users who want to track the searches of more experienced users before diving in themselves. Once a privacy setting is adjusted within SearchTogether to give access to trusted people, Dr. Morris said, “others can see what you are seeing on your browser.”Dr. Twidale of the University of Illinois particularly admires SearchTogether’s educational features like “peek and follow.” “These can help participants think of new ways to reformulate their queries,” he said. “Seeing the vocabulary and syntax other people are using might help a person be a more successful searcher.”The system also lets users share their search results with others in the future; all the results are automatically saved.“If someone has a medical problem,” Dr. Morris said, “and wants to know what you learned on your search months ago, that person can be added to the group,” free to view the stored search history.THE Microsoft program is one of a number of collaborative tools in the works that will add a new dimension to searching, said Gary Marchionini, a professor of information science at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill. “Right now I have my screen and I search,” he said. “My colleague does the same thing, and we have clumsy ways for sharing the results.”But that could change. “Why shouldn’t we collaborate on a search from the get-go?” he asked. “We can partition the job out, have a place to put joint results and then annotate them” in summary sections. “So we can say not only ‘this is what I found,’ but ‘these are the most salient things about it.’ That will make us more productive.”'"
"'08-11-23,'0','NEW DELHI, India — After an intense debate on whether to begin a formal independence movement, the majority of delegates attending a conference of Tibetan exiles in northern India recommended Saturday that the Tibetan government in exile continue to adopt the Dalai Lama’s conciliatory approach to China, a Tibetan spokesman said.But in a sign of mounting frustration with fruitless negotiations with China, most delegates also advised the Tibetan government to end the dialogue until China shows real willingness to negotiate, the spokesman, Thubten Samphel, said in a telephone interview from Dharamsala, India.The delegates made their recommendations at the end of a six-day conference called by the Dalai Lama, the spiritual leader of Tibetans worldwide, who has pursued a “middle way” approach in which he has called for China to grant autonomy to its six million Tibetans. The Dalai Lama has not called for Tibetan independence and prefers to deal with China without confrontation.“The majority view is that the middle way approach is the best approach for now,” Mr. Samphel said of the results of the conference.But the intractability of the Tibetan problem, highlighted by an uprising of Tibetans last spring and a subsequent Chinese crackdown, has led more and more Tibetan exiles, especially younger ones, to lobby the government in exile to start a formal independence movement. Several prominent exile groups like the Tibetan Youth Congress already advocate independence. Tibet enjoyed a period of self-governance early last century until Chinese troops invaded in 1950.'"

"'08-11-23,'0','The reality, though, is that not hiring — or seriously thinning the ranks of junior employees — can lead to problems down the road. Companies that are not in dire shape would do well to think long and hard before they pull back from new recruiting or dismiss their newest workers.For one thing, word spreads quickly when an employer lets a lot of people go or rescinds job offers. That can hamper future recruiting efforts.“Some businesses are doing this because they really haven’t thought through what the implications are,” said Robert J. Thomas, executive director of the Accenture Institute for High Performance Business, part of Accenture, the consulting firm. “It’s not just the older employees who get nervous. It’s also the younger employees and the prospective employees. A company’s brand as an employer is absolutely critical, and if they start doing things in haste, they can very quickly devalue that brand.”Dr. Thomas said corporate job cuts, especially in financial services, have “thrown business schools into a tizzy.” Many students are switching gears and taking jobs in other industries, he said.At the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University, students seem to be more inclined to take offers stemming from their summer internships, said Roxanne Hori, the director of career management.“The hiring is happening, but it’s much more conservative than it has been,” she said. And while she has not yet seen companies rescind offers, she anticipates that some will. As a result, she said, students are saying: “I didn’t hate my job and the markets aren’t great. I think I’ll take this offer.”The career counseling specialists at Kellogg are also working with unusually high numbers of alumni, Ms. Hori said. Alumni counseling appointments in 2007-8 were up roughly 35 percent from a year earlier, to about 4,100, and Ms. Hori expects the number of graduates looking for work or exploring career changes to increase during the current academic year.Companies do not just lose appeal as employers if they lay off younger workers or freeze hiring. They may also limit their ability to develop future leaders.At Southwest Airlines, many of the top executives got their start in relatively low-level jobs at the company, according to Jeff Lamb, chief people officer for the airline.“Virtually everyone has a story where they started out in an entry-level job and moved up through the ranks,” Mr. Lamb said, adding that 90 to 95 percent of management jobs are filled internally. “We just tend to populate that pipeline with our front-line employees.”Southwest plans to sharply trim hiring next year — 1,500 people, compared with about 3,500 in 2008. Mr. Lamb said that most of the new hiring is directly tied to the airline’s growing number of flights.He said he was pleased to find less competition for top job candidates right now. “There is an opportunity, and we like that,” he said.The reality for employers is that scarce talent will still be scarce when the economy improves, said Laura Sejen, practice director for strategic rewards at Watson Wyatt, the consulting firm. In past recessions, “the employers that emerged more intact were the ones who had not done the very extensive slash-and-burn kind of layoffs,” she said.“I’m not saying never do layoffs,” Ms. Sejen added. “I’m saying do it only when you have to, and mindfully and carefully. Make sure you really analyze the demographics of your work force,” and determine where the greatest future growth — and demand for employees — will probably be.“The across-the-board 5 percent reduction,” she said, “is not the best way to go.”'"
"'08-11-23,'0','The number of Holocaust-related memoirs, novels, documentaries and feature films in the past decade or so seems to defy quantification, and their proliferation raises some uncomfortable questions. Why are there so many? Why now? And more queasily, could there be too many?The moral imperatives imposed by the slaughter of European Jews are Never Again and Never Forget, which mean, logically, that the story of the Holocaust must be repeated again and again. But the sheer scale of the atrocity — the six million extinguished lives and the millions more that were indelibly scarred, damaged and disrupted — suggests that the research, documentation and imaginative reconstruction, the building of memorials and museums, the writing of books and scripts, no matter how scrupulous and exhaustive, will necessarily be partial, inadequate and belated. And this tragic foreknowledge of insufficiency, which might be inhibiting, turns out, on the contrary, to spur the creation of more and more material.Shortly after the war the German critic T. W. Adorno declared that “to write poetry after Auschwitz is barbaric.” This observation has frequently been interpreted, aphoristically, as a fiat of silence, a prohibition against the use of the ordinary tools of culture to address the extraordinary, inassimilable fact of genocide. But those tools, however crude, are what we have to work with. And if Adorno intended a warning against representations of the Holocaust, it has been more quoted than heeded.The perception that this catastrophe overwhelms conventional aesthetic strategies and traditions has led to the creation of a remarkable range of formally innovative work, including the lyric poetry of Paul Celan, the early prose works of Elie Wiesel, Claude Lanzmann’s epic documentary “Shoah,” Art Spiegelman’s “Maus” and Peter Eisenmann’s Berlin memorial to the Jewish victims of Nazism.To describe these as masterpieces is not especially controversial, but it is also, as Adorno perhaps anticipated, somehow unseemly. If the Holocaust can inspire a great work of art, then it can also incubate the ambition to achieve such greatness, and thus open itself up, like everything else, to exploitation, pretense and vulgarity. Worse, the aura that still surrounds this topic — the sense that it must be treated with a special measure of tact and awe — can be appropriated by clumsy, sentimental and meretricious films or books, which protect themselves from criticism by a cloak of seriousness and piety. Thus the immodest indecency of a movie like Roberto Benigni’s Oscar-winning “Life Is Beautiful” was, during its initial period of triumph, deflected onto those with the temerity to criticize it. Those who resisted its manipulative juxtaposition of sweet, childlike innocence with barbarity were accused of lacking the gravity and sensitivity that Mr. Benigni’s travesty required.And a similar defense is invoked, explicitly or implicitly, so routinely that it calls forth cynicism. Why do opportunistic, clever young novelists — I won’t name any names — gravitate toward magic-realist depictions of the decidedly unmagical reality of the Shoah? For the same reason that actors shave their heads and starve themselves, or preen and leer in jackboots and epaulets. For the same reason that filmmakers commission concrete barracks and instruct their cinematographers and lab technicians to filter out bright, saturated colors. To win prizes of course.Ms. Winslet said as much on an episode of “Extras”: “I’ve noticed that if you do a film about the Holocaust, you’re guaranteed an Oscar.” She was joking, of course, though her appearance in “The Reader” suggests that the joke is funny because it’s often true. Why else do you suppose all the movies listed at the beginning of this article, including “The Reader,” are coming out in November and December? Not because Hanukkah is coming.Of course the line between kitsch and art is notoriously blurry, and in any case kitsch has its uses. The television miniseries “Holocaust” is nobody’s idea of a masterpiece, but its broadcast, in 1979, on West German state television was a decisive event in that nation’s reckoning with its culpability. It is estimated that more than half of the adult German population watched the series.Subsequently, according to the historian Tony Judt, “Germans would be among the best-informed Europeans on the subject of the Shoah and at the forefront of all efforts to maintain public awareness of their country’s singular crime.” The French conscience may have been stirred by superior movies — “The Sorrow and the Pity,” “Shoah” — but France was much slower to acknowledge the full measure of its complicity.And in this country “Schindler’s List” in 1993 was a similar watershed. Though the Holocaust was not a central event in American history, “Schindler’s List,” even more than “Holocaust,” made it into one by turning it into the basis of a Hollywood epic. Buying a ticket was treated almost a moral duty — “You have to see it. You have to!” nagged Jerry Seinfeld’s sitcom parents — and its Oscar-night triumph was staged as a grand collective catharsis.“Schindler’s List” undoubtedly gave rise to a new pedagogical and commemorative impulse. It also, however, helped to domesticate the Holocaust by making it a fixture of American middlebrow popular culture. Which I don’t mean entirely as a criticism, since that culture is better than a lot of the alternatives. But Hollywood trades in optimism, redemption and healing, and its rendering of even the most appalling realities inevitably converts their dire facts into its own shiny currency.Thus “Schindler’s List,” for all its unsparing and powerful re-creations of the horror of the Krakow ghetto, is a story of heroism, resilience and survival. And a great many of the mainstream Holocaust movies that have followed, including documentaries and some foreign films, have emphasized hope and overcoming rather than despair and destruction. When death dominates these films — as it does in “The Boy in the Striped Pajamas,” an apt successor to “Life Is Beautiful” — it is spiritualized and rendered aesthetically palatable by an overlay of maudlin sentiment.More often the reality of mass death gives way to yet another affirmation of life, and even faithfully rendered true stories are bent into conformity with familiar patterns, themes and conventions: forbidden love; noble sacrifice; victory against the odds. The Holocaust is more accessible than ever, and more entertaining.At the same time it is receding from living memory, which may by itself explain the recent burst of cinematic and literary interest. The movies I find most interesting, most authentic, either address this painful process directly, measuring the distance between our time and the 1930s and ’40s rather than recreating that era faithfully in every detail, or else cleave to the particulars of a single story. Thus Roman Polanski’s “Pianist” and Lajos Koltai’s “Fateless,” though both tales of survival, register the absurdity and abnormality of survival in the manner of the first-person literary works on which they are based.“A Secret” and “One Day You’ll Understand” are meditations on what it means to remember. It is no coincidence that both take place in France, where the habit and policy of forgetting endured until quite recently. In those films, full of unresolved feelings of grief, tenderness and bewilderment, French Jews born after World War II try to figure out what the annihilation of their parents’ world means to them. In both cases the past is both painfully pressing and, mercifully but maddeningly, out of reach.And in both cases the filmmakers explore not only strong feelings but also complicated ideas. The sensations associated with the Holocaust have become perhaps too easy to evoke, given the power of cinema to dispense fear, pity, sorrow and relief through sound, image and pageantry.This has been the route taken by most English-language films about the Holocaust, and also some of their slick European counterparts, like “Black Book” and “The Counterfeiters.” But “A Secret” and “One Day You’ll Understand” represent another strain in European and Israeli film, one that may reflect a deeper cultural difference. In the United States the Holocaust is a mystery, a puzzle, and the obsessive interest in it testifies to its intrinsic strangeness. In France, in Germany and in Eastern Europe it remains an urgent problem that needs to be worked out — in art, in politics and in the society as a whole.It seems right that movies about a difficult subject should themselves be difficult. But the fate of difficult movies with subtitles, usually, is to slip in and out of American theaters without leaving much of a trace. The big Holocaust movies of the big movie season will make more of an impression, allowing audiences vicarious immersion in a history that they nonetheless keep at a safe, mediated difference, even as they risk bathos and overreach in the process. We don’t have to ask what the Holocaust means to us since the movies answer that question for us.For American audiences a Holocaust movie is now more or less equivalent to a western or a combat picture or a sword-and-sandals epic — part of a genre that has less to do with history than with the perceived expectations of moviegoers. This may be the only, or at least the most widely available, way of keeping the past alive in memory, but it is also a kind of forgetting.'"
"'08-11-23,'0','Also, the number of jobs lost does not take into account positions held by thousands of Connecticut residents employed in New York. The State Labor Department is working with counterparts in New York and New Jersey to assess the regional impact of the Wall Street crisis, but it is too early to estimate the effect on unemployment, Mr. Tirinzonie said.For job seekers, even a “mild” recession is small consolation. “In this economic downturn, it will be much harder to find a job,” Mr. Tirinzonie said.Still, there is some good news: The sharp drop in petroleum prices could save drivers an average of $600 a year, or $1.8 billion statewide, which would stimulate the economy if spent on other goods and services, the U Conn analysis says. Also, if fossil fuel prices continue declining, the boon to businesses could result in as few as 11,000 job losses, it says.But government financing initiatives will be important to restoring a robust economy, the report says.For one of the U Conn economists, the caliber of Connecticut’s work force is more worrisome than the recent Wall Street meltdown. “The real problem in Connecticut is the lack of job growth over the past 20 years,” Fred V. Carstensen, director of the Connecticut Center for Economic Analysis, said in a recent phone interview. “We have fewer private sector jobs than in 1989, and a shrinking and declining work force. The state is losing its competitive edge.”High-wage jobs have been replaced by low-wage jobs, Mr. Carstensen said. Noting that Connecticut’s best and brightest seek their fortunes elsewhere, he said, “the least educated and least skilled don’t leave the state.” That means, he said, that social services will be overwhelmed in the future.Others disagreed. “We are moving more to a service-based economy,” Mr. Tirinzonie said, “which might have slightly lower paying jobs, but a good many still require post-secondary education.”Connecticut wants to retain its educated young people, Mr. Tirinzonie said. “We have gotten proactive in trying to keep college students here or to relocate back here,” he said. “Our Job Expo this month made students aware of professional jobs in the Hartford-Springfield area.”As for housing, the decline in sales of single-family homes appears to be leveling off, but experts warn that this is not a sign of economic recovery. Statewide sales of single-family homes in September were down 5.3 percent from September 2007, bucking a trend of double-digit declines, according to the Warren Group, which tracks real estate transactions. Sales in Fairfield County dropped 6.27 percent in September, and the median house price in Fairfield County plunged 12.25 percent from last September.'"
"'08-11-23,'0','Various high Nazi gargoyles are also on show, including Göring, whom Herr N. refers to as the Mad Gamekeeper. (He calls Goebbels Nosferatu.) At one point Goebbels, Streicher and Hitler show up to pay their respects to the dying Chamberlain, then hijack the old man’s funeral. Brownshirts in great numbers muster in the churchyard, lustily singing, “Deutschland, Deutschland über alles.”There is a scatological leitmotif in this narrative, morally figurative of the Nazi ambience. Watching Hitler deliver a speech from an upstairs window, Herr N. notes that with every patriotic phrase, “the buttocks let out the quickfire whumps and cracks that accompanied the volleys firing from the mouth, and the room gradually filled with a gaseous sulphur odor.” He comes up with his “flatulence theory”: the idea that Hitler at the moment of orgasm would break wind. No woman could be expected not to laugh, and to Hitler this would be intolerable. But Winnie Wagner, with her hero-­worship of the man and her great warmth of heart — with her, it would be different.The reader is all too aware that this strain of earthy humor is rooted in disgust, and that the moral stench it fails to mask is that of anti-Semitism, and ultimately the Holocaust. But Herr N.’s own peculiar anguish is more complicated than mere loathing of the Nazis. “Is our capacity to love another person,” he asks, “often (always) accompanied by an inability to notice what it is that prevents the majority of other people loving them?”The answer is a resounding yes. As has been clear from the start, Herr N.’s account of Winnie’s relationship with Hitler is skewed because he is himself hopelessly in love with her. It is an exquisite anguish, for to him Hitler is not so much a raving fanatic as a romantic rival: “I only loathed him because Winnie loved him. Because Winnie loved him, I would not admit there was anything wrong with loving him, a contorted state of mind that led me to the ludicrous and disgraceful position of defending H when he was attacked by my scrupulous and morally intelligent family.”And there’s the rub, his morally intelligent family. Herr N. can reveal Hitler as an avuncular family friend, tender with the children, a lover of opera, a humble, gentle, charming man. As Führer, Hitler caves in to Winnie’s demands that Jewish musicians she needs at Bayreuth be left alone. He even defers to her when she insists that no Nazi be allowed to run the Bayreuth Festival (making it the one area of artistic freedom in all of Germany). But the darkness will keep coming through, and it’s in the story of Herr N.’s morally intelligent family that the book’s true theme emerges.What did Hitler get from the operas of Richard Wagner? Late in the story, Herr N. characterizes Nazism as “an occult rite” that burrowed deep into “that Gothic depth of the irrational which the Enlightenment . . . had merely driven underground.” He cites Wagner’s late work as one such Gothic manifestation, and sees its “fertile, poisonous soil of mythology” as the breeding ground in which Hitler’s anti-Semitism flourished. The racist cast of Wagner’s thought, particularly late in his life, was intense, but Herr N. is adamant that the composer be excused responsibility for what the Nazis made of his operas: “They sought in them not the disturbing and ever-changing power of sound and story, but rather the hard confirmation of their ideology.” It is against the working out of that ideology that the events Herr N. describes to his daughter must be viewed.There’s never a shortage of corpses in books about Nazis, and violence is a constant here. But in counterpoint to Herr N.’s moral paralysis in the face of that violence and his sustained infatuation with Winnie — “a goddess,” “a vision of glory” — there remains the perilous, principled defiance of his parents and his brother, Heinrich. The savage beating the Nazis give Heinrich is a precursor to the fate that inevitably overtakes him. “The Nazis made me a Christian,” he writes to Herr N. shortly before they hang him.In 1945 the United States Air Force bombed Bayreuth. Herr N. tells his daughter it was “for liking the wrong kind of music.” And so ends, with a defense of Richard Wagner — who cannot, after all, be held responsible for what a madman, born years after his death, made of his operas — this marvelous, sweeping, darkly funny and ultimately tragic novel.h'"
"'08-11-23,'0','During my 20s, I became born-again for a few weeks. I told a friend I’d give it a shot, which was not the thunderstruck, speaking-in-tongues response she would have liked. Pray to Jesus and only to Jesus and you’ll be saved, I was told. I knew I’d miss leaving all the unsaved people I loved. After a few Sundays, I prayed to Mary to get me out of there.It was during visits to the Tibetan Light House that I had the privilege to sit and meditate with visiting monks, and it was during a christening at a friend’s Methodist church that I heard a sermon about giving up control that to this day resonates with me. I felt completely at home in the Unitarian Universalist Church, with its inborn sense of moral duty to the community and planet minus the barnacle-like dogma. And it was during my 10-year friendship with my ancient Jewish neighbor that I learned what it meant to keep a kosher house.I can’t say I’ve studied the major religions, but I can say that I’ve read about each (along with the current crop of atheist best sellers) and approached each in a curious and unattached way.Still, when my babies arrived, the christenings followed. That was what we as a family had always done. And with each christening, envelopes from the church arrived. We were now parishioners, a mere technicality, since we never attended church.It was more than 10 years ago, during a tear-filled telephone conversation with me — in which I agonized over potty training my 3-year-old and getting my 9-month-old to sleep through the night — that my mother, who had not been to church in years, suggested I go to a novena. I felt God was busy enough, but my mother said, “Don’t you think Mary had to wean Jesus, don’t you think she had to potty-train him?” And off I went, and during those 20 minutes I prayed and I cried. Yes, my baby slept through that night for the first time in her new life, and thankfully my son is no longer in diapers. But, I have never questioned that simple faith. It is precisely that faith that has always sustained me.I started my children in the small parish school down the street for the convenience of it. Their main preschool prayer was “Thank you God for the food we eat, thank you God for the world so sweet, thank you God for the birds that sing, thank you God for everything.” I loved this reprieve from the complicated world. It was as I wanted my faith (and my children’s faith) to be: awe at the universe, thanks for the blessings, oh, and world peace someday. They continued on in the school. My son was adorable as St. Michael the archangel in first grade, long, white plastic wings tapping the ground behind him, and my daughter resplendent in her Mary attire in the second-grade Nativity pageant. With that came the realization that these were their lives I was now dealing with. These would be their memories.My son is now in the eighth grade, learning Latin and all the dogma that comes with Catholicism. He comes home furious some days at the injustices he sees: namely the ease with which the Bible disposes of first-born sons, and the whole concept of original sin. I wasn’t even born then, he complains.My daughter set up a small altar in her room to pray to Mary in the fourth grade, and grapples sometimes with the disconnect between her religion classes and the philosophy of her parents at home. She says that she believes in eternal life, and she says, “not the way you do, but the way the church says to believe: eternal life with Jesus.” I let them both be. I feel I’m keeping their intelligent minds nimble, open and humorous, while at the same time helping them to build a foundation, a basement, if you will, that they can build on and up from there (or up and out of there).So here I sit for this moment of time, occasionally at Mass with my children. I may be that phony in the pew beside you. I will stand and kneel, but not recite the creed, receive communion or feel I am a sinner because of my beliefs. And through it all, I still begin and end each day as I did for as long as I can remember: with a prayer of thanks.'"
"'08-11-23,'0','“The Waves” may be Woolf’s most ambitious evocation of the intricate workings of consciousness as it unfolds from moment to moment, from year to year, from the dreaming days of childhood to the darker passage of later life. It consists of the interior monologues of six British men and women at crucial junctures in their lives, divided by short, densely lyrical descriptions of the sun rising and setting over a house by the British shore where they all shared a defining moment in their youth. There is little action in the book, the singular exception being a dinner party at which all of the characters meet in young adulthood; “The Waves” is virtually all reflection.The actors in Ms. Mitchell’s production, which recalls the work of the Wooster Group in its intricate mingling of sound and video into the theatrical experience, read selected passages from the novel. But they certainly do not lack for activity. With unflagging energy and speed they scuttle around the stage, grabbing props from shelves at the side, moving video cameras in and out of position, standing at the ready to create a sound effect at precisely the right moment to match an image. They essentially create in real time a movie (or at least a series of video images) that is projected on a screen at the back of the stage.Their labors are impressive certainly, but they are also sorely distracting from the more necessary task of staying attuned to the reflections of the novel’s half-dozen characters, which gradually come to revolve around their relationship to a common friend, Percival. (“Is the novel this confusing?” my companion asked.) And rarely did any image seem to justify by its beauty, inventiveness or emotional weight the labor involved in manufacturing it before us live. (One, a shot of a love-struck schoolboy lasciviously devouring a banana as he stared longingly at the male object of his affection, was downright puerile.)More crucially, Woolf’s novel is about the subjective — and fundamentally solitary — nature of life, the way our experience is shaped by the words we use to process it in the quiet chambers of our minds. If somebody asked you whether life most resembles a novel or a play, you might superficially answer that it resembles the theater — with our families and friends as characters, our careers and conflicts and relationships as the action. “The Waves” illuminates the idea that the essence of life is not experience itself but our responses to it, the unrecorded book we each write of our lives inside our minds. Putting the novel onstage seems to subvert this idea from the start.“The Waves” presents particular challenges, but there are fundamental differences in our experiences of theater and literature that keep the odds stacked against any success in the enterprise of adapting literature to the stage. Reading is an inward, intimate experience, a quiet communion between one imagination and another. The reader is the author’s active collaborator. Words are just signifiers after all. The images and experiences they evoke are brought into being in the mind of the reader. Books happen inside us; theater happens to us. The difference may be subtle — both can of course move us in similar ways — but it is crucial. The theater is also a collaboration between audience and writer, but it is a communal one, mediated by directors, designers and actors. The singular vision of a novelist is likely to be diluted as it passes through several sets of hands. And the fiction writer does not have the constraints on the scope of his work that theater artists do. Nobody expects to read a novel in two hours, three tops.Reduction is virtually a necessity in the process of adaptation, and the most common flaw in stage versions of novels is an emphasis on narrative at the expense of thought. Frank Galati, who directed the stage version of “Kafka on the Shore” at the Steppenwolf Theater in Chicago, was undoubtedly seduced by the vivid strangeness of the story and the imagery in Mr. Murakami’s novel, with its talking cats and its cast of oddball archetypes, including Colonel Sanders and Johnnie Walker. (This is Mr. Galati’s second Murakami production, following “After the Quake.”)But the dreamlike narrative of the novel, while it retained its color onstage, tended to shrink into a cartoonish silliness at the same time. Without the binding ingredient of Mr. Murakami’s prose to link together the experience of the novel’s two central characters — a boy named Kafka fleeing a dire prophecy and the cat-converser, survivor of a strange accident when he was a child in World War II — the events lose the haunting weight they carry in the book. With the shaping consciousness of the author surgically removed, the narrative felt arbitrary and at times impenetrable.Woolf and Mr. Murakami are both modern (or postmodern) novelists, of course, and it might be supposed that the sturdier, more narrative-driven novels of the 19th century would provide stronger bones for a stage version. But Dostoyevsky, with his hallucinatory prose and dark intensity of thought, was even more ill-served by the Lookingglass production, adapted and directed by Heidi Stillman.For despite Ms. Stillman’s honorable, lucid distillation of the novel’s action, the play felt like a telenovela twice translated, only with drearier clothing. The conflict between the father and son who love the same woman and the mystery of who murdered papa were stripped of the mystical and moral weight they carry in the book.This was not because Ms. Stillman excised the book’s ethical and theological arguments. They were duly included. But complex philosophical ideas have a way of shrinking into banalities when they are severely edited and spoken aloud. Language that we process comfortably when we encounter it in a book can easily seem leaden or unnatural when spoken on a stage.The production certainly evoked the Russian experience in at least one respect. By the time its three and a half hours had concluded, I felt as if I’d been staggering across the steppes for a day or two and was ready for a revivifying shot of vodka.In the segment of the “Grand Inquisitor” that he adapted, Mr. Brook understood that to tinker with the intricacy of Dostoyevsky’s philosophical argument would negate its effectiveness. A longtime master of stage minimalism, Mr. Brook recognized where the weight of Dostoyevsky’s parable story lies: in the eerie force of the words themselves and in the movement of the Grand Inquisitor’s argument as he challenges the figure of Jesus to justify the choices he made.This was the least overtly theatrical of all the literary adaptations I saw this fall. There was no set to speak of, and no action. One of the two characters onstage never spoke a word. But in allowing the production to unfold in accord with the rhythms of the prose work it was drawn from, with no attempt to decorate it with visual or aural effects, Mr. Brook kept a tight hold on its power to move us to think and to feel.You might conclude, of course, that simply to put onstage a reading of this passage from the novel, as Mr. Brook essentially has, would be superfluous. Why not just read it? But Mr. Brook surely understood too that the single action that concludes the story, the kiss Jesus bestows on the Grand Inquisitor, has a far greater impact onstage than it ever could on paper.A kiss described, after all, is not the same thing as a kiss received.'"

Pitched to various levels of curiosity and income, they take for granted a willingness to lug around a book.But with that field overcrowded — how many more “insider” guides to Paris and New York do we need? — and with tourists seeking advice via hand-held devices instead of printed paper, a number of publishers have sensed a new market by helping us decide where to travel before we travel there.“Where to Go When” is a slick coffee-table book of possibilities. A month-by-month survey of desirable places throughout the hemisphere, it is as much a guide for dreaming of trips as it is for planning them. Each of the 12 chapters offers a menu of choices, depending on the objective: culture, nature, romance, active adventure or family getaway.Proposed stops come with notes on how to get there, where to stay and eat, as well as a weather forecast and estimated cost for two (excluding airfare). Dorling Kindersley guides excel at well-organized graphics, and this one is no exception. A 20-page atlas of detailed maps in the back and hundreds of color photographs make this a book to be held in the lap at home, not carried aboard a plane.It is doubly frustrating therefore that so much of the advice given is either obvious (Rio for Carnival) or illogical. The format is imprisoning. Places are slotted into a single month and never assessed according to season.'"
"'08-11-23,'0','Year after year, our entertainment options proliferate: more shows on more channels, more amusements via more online venues, more diversions on our gaming consoles and mobile devices. Fluttering along in this blizzard of the new, there is the not-new, the still-with-us, the vintage, the classic . . . the old. Sitcom reruns, for instance, angle to keep entertaining us, over and over, and profitably. It is in that context that the “Seinfeld” promotional bus tour concluded in Las Vegas this weekend — a 30-city marketing gimmick for a show that went off the air a decade ago.Except that it didn’t really go off the air, of course. In New York City it’s on five times every weekday. Nielsen Media Research tracks the cumulative audience for syndicated programming, including reruns, and among sitcom reruns, “Seinfeld” has remained in the top five such shows watched by 25-to-54-year-olds throughout its afterlife. On a recent week, it finished third, behind reruns of “Two and a Half Men” and “Family Guy,” with a viewership of about 4.9 million people.The business of reruns can generate “mega coin,” as The Hollywood Reporter might put it, but it’s unpredictable. “Success on the network doesn’t mean success in syndication,” notes Chuck Larsen, president of October Moon Television, which consults with production companies on syndication and other matters. Some real-time hits never catch on as reruns — “Murphy Brown,” a cultural phenomenon in its heyday, is an example. Maybe that’s because there’s a difference between the way we watch prime-time shows and the way we watch reruns while doing dishes or nodding off. Maybe it’s because some shows just feel dated more quickly. Other sitcoms start strong in the rerun market but gradually fade: “Friends” surged past “Seinfeld” on the rerun charts for a time but has since retreated to lower audience levels.With this in mind, Sony Pictures Television, which distributes “Seinfeld,” convened a meeting two years ago to figure out how to court new viewers for an old show. The resulting marketing, sales and promotion strategy was dubbed “Seinfeld: The Next Generation,” according to Robert Oswaks, president of marketing for that Sony division. The tour was its most conspicuous element: a 60-foot bus whose stops included many college campuses, to generate publicity that might attract those who were too young to have participated in the show’s first-run popularity.Syndicated sitcoms have traditionally been pushed through on-air promos and ads in the television sections of newspapers, but as marketing the new has changed, so has marketing the old. “I don’t really think there is a precedent,” Oswaks says, for such post-mass-media tactics deployed on behalf of a mass-era rerun property. He notes that the traveling setup includes computer kiosks where you can visit the “Seinfeld” Facebook page and, as Oswaks somewhat imprecisely puts it in a video on the tour’s promotional site, “join our social profile.”The bus’s interior has been modified into a kind of rolling Smithsonian for “Seinfeld” freaks, displaying props like the Bro/Manzier, “Fusilli Jerry,” the Assman license plate, the doll that looks like George’s mom and a replica of “the puffy shirt.” (The original puffy shirt is in the actual Smithsonian. Welcome to America.) There are show-relevant giveaways — Junior Mints, black-and-white cookies — and a replica of Monk’s Diner. And whether on campuses or at malls or sporting events, what’s easiest to imagine is the fervent believer dragging along potential converts. The bus, which Sony says was visited by an estimated 45,000 people, simply makes tangible the devotion that already exists, presenting the show about nothing as a labyrinthine text, a fully immersive narrative that’s not about nothing but about itself: totems, references, rituals. It’s a walk-in catechism.'"

"'08-11-23,'0','I enjoyed Alistair Macauley’s critical insight into the Balanchine legacy [“Mother Ship Off Balance, Balanchine Soars,” Nov. 16].As a former student of Melissa Hayden, one of the six original Balanchine ballerinas, I found the “Balanchine vocabulary” of movement to be hard and fast in its rules. There was to be no diversion from Balanchine’s style: arriving on the “one” (with the music), emphasizing the contrast between closed positions and stretched open ones, and in general, concentrating on the vibrant musicality of his steps.Therefore I was interested to learn that City Ballet’s presentation of the Balanchine modicum has been changing, or even relaxing, through the years. As a follow-up I would be interested to learn more about other companies performing Balanchine works.As I understand it, it can be difficult to obtain the license to perform the ballets, per the standards set by the Balanchine Trust.How can companies of smaller and more regional stature share this special part of ballet — that which has come to be known as the only true American ballet?'"

"'08-11-24,'1','“One of the things that I feel very encouraged about is the president-elect and where he’d like to take this country in terms of energy, and I completely buy into his vision,” Mr. Ford said in an interview, his first since the Big Three approached Washington lawmakers about a rescue plan.He can afford to take a longer view because Ford, unlike G.M. and Chrysler, does not need an immediate infusion of government aid to stay in business.While Ford’s chief executive, Alan R. Mulally, joined his counterparts from G.M. and Chrysler in testifying before Congress last week, Ford is not asking for an immediate bailout from Washington for now.The company has enough cash on hand — $18.9 billion, as well as a $10.7 billion line of credit with private lenders — that will keep it running through 2009 without cutting development of its next generation of more fuel-efficient cars.While Ford cannot continue to burn cash indefinitely, it is also not on the verge of bankruptcy like G.M. and Chrysler. And the health of the company presents a unique opportunity for Mr. Ford, 51, who has been chairman of the company since 1999 and served five years as its chief executive.“We have a plan that is high-tech, product-driven, which is a fuel economy plan,” he said. “And we have kept that plan in place under these tough conditions.”In August, Mr. Ford shared those plans with Mr. Obama, then candidate for president, when he was in Lansing, Mich., for a speech on energy policy.“We talked about the electrification of our industry and other fuel-economy issues,” Mr. Ford said. “He’s a great listener and he asked all the right questions.”Mr. Ford said they focused on a few specific, industrywide issues. One was government help to put more electric cars on the road.“One of the things we need to sort out as a country is batteries,” Mr. Ford said. “We really don’t want to trade one foreign dependency, oil, for another foreign dependency, batteries.” The main producers of batteries are Asian manufacturers.He does not profess to have Mr. Obama’s ear yet on the how to save Detroit. But Mr. Ford is keeping close contact through Governor Granholm, a member of the president-elect’s economic advisory team.“I think he is a key player,” she said of Mr. Ford. “He has tremendous credibility with respect to the serious issues related to renewable energy and energy security for this nation.”Mr. Ford has been Detroit’s most vocal environmentalist since becoming the first family member to run Ford since his uncle, Henry Ford II.Even when Ford was living off profits from its big sport utility vehicles, he was pushing to take the company in a greener direction. Ford was the first automaker to bring to market a hybrid version of an S.U.V., the Ford Escape, and it is introducing a new line of Ecoboost engines next year that will cut fuel consumption by up to 20 percent.The Ford family controls the automaker by virtue of its 70.85 million shares of Class B stock, which carry 40 percent voting rights for the entire company.But the family’s wealth has taken a drastic hit as losses have mounted at Ford and its stock price has plunged.The family’s Class B shares were worth $101 million at Friday’s closing price of $1.43 a share, down 81 percent from a year ago when the shares had a value of $532 million.Mr. Ford also owns 5.2 million shares individually, which have dropped in value to $7.4 million from $39 million.“The family clearly has taken an enormous financial beating,” Mr. Ford said. “But the family still is here and standing behind the company.”The company is in better shape than G.M. and Chrysler, but just barely. Ford has lost $24 billion since 2006, and it reduced its cash cushion by $7.9 billion in the third quarter this year.Two years ago, Ford was seen as the riskiest bet in the industry to survive when it mortgaged nearly all its assets, even its blue Ford oval trademark, to secure a huge line of credit.Now, with the collapse of the credit market, G.M. and Chrysler cannot borrow money on their assets and could face insolvency by the end of the year without federal assistance.Mr. Ford said his company was interested in being able to access government loans only if the economy continues to deteriorate. “We’re trying very hard not to need it,” he said. “Our plan is to have our own liquidity and get through without it.”Ford has already undergone an extensive revamping at the direction of Mr. Mulally, who succeeded Mr. Ford as the automaker’s chief executive in 2006.Since then, the company has cut 40,000 jobs, sold off three of its brands and begun an effort to transform its truck-heavy vehicle fleet with an influx of smaller, more fuel-efficient cars.Mr. Ford remained in Detroit last week as Mr. Mulally endured two days of harsh criticism by lawmakers over Detroit’s financial plight, along with G.M.’s chairman, Rick Wagoner, and Chrysler’s chairman, Robert L. Nardelli.In the interview, Mr. Ford said that some of the skepticism from Congress about the industry’s future was justified. “I completely understand the frustration that Americans feel and it came out loud and clear this week,” he said. “I don’t think we told our story terribly well.”After 15 years of relying on pickup trucks and S.U.V.’s for profit, Ford is putting the bulk of its capital investment into smaller cars.Much of the debate in Washington has centered on the best source of government money for an emergency loan program for Detroit.One is a $25 billion low-interest loan program already passed by Congress that provides money specifically for improvements in fuel efficiency.Ford has applied for $7 billion of those loans, which are administered by the Department of Energy. Mr. Ford expects that any aid from the Obama administration in the future will be tied to improvements in fuel economy.“We just submitted our application to the D.O.E. and what’s interesting is in the next two years, 75 percent of our vehicles will qualify for their definition of advanced vehicle technology,” he said.Mr. Ford said he was committed to helping Mr. Obama end America’s dependence on foreign oil whether Detroit gets a bailout before the end of the year or not.“It’s all about fuel economy and energy independence,” he said. “I passionately believe that Ford can and should be part of that solution.”'"

"'08-11-24,'1','After months of enabling Zimbabwe’s Robert Mugabe, South Africa has decided to withhold $30 million in farm aid until there is a representative government in Harare. That is only a fraction of South Africa’s assistance, but we hope that it means that Pretoria has finally lost patience with the dictator. Without strong and sustained outside pressure, Mr. Mugabe will never loosen his death grip on power.Mr. Mugabe is refusing to honor a power-sharing deal negotiated with his rival Morgan Tsvangirai — the man who should be Zimbabwe’s president. Mr. Tsvangirai won the first round of voting but was forced to withdraw from the runoff by Mr. Mugabe’s army-backed thugs. Mr. Mugabe is now insisting on keeping control of both the police and the army.The Southern African Development Community, the 15-nation regional bloc, is pushing Mr. Tsvangirai to accept a compromise in which Mr. Mugabe retains control of the army and intelligence services, while the two men share control of the police. It is a bad deal and Mr. Tsvangirai is right to resist. The S.A.D.C. must not recognize Mr. Mugabe as Zimbabwe’s president unless the power-sharing agreement is put into effect. While the region’s leaders temporize, life in Zimbabwe grows more desperate each day. According to the United States ambassador in Harare, more than 1.5 million Zimbabweans now face starvation, the health system has collapsed and cholera is spreading due to poor sanitation. Mr. Mugabe, who has driven his country to ruin, cares only about himself and his cronies.On the face of it, South Africa’s decision to withhold farm aid from a population in distress might seem cruel. But the affected assistance includes fertilizer, farm equipment and fuel — which are not needed until next year’s planting season. American officials and experts say any aid given directly to the government would only benefit Mr. Mugabe, not ordinary citizens.What Zimbabwe urgently needs is food. Over two months ago, the United Nations World Food Program appealed for $140 million more to directly feed Zimbabweans in need. So far, it has not received firm commitments. (Washington, the biggest donor, gave $186 million in humanitarian assistance in 2008.) Zimbabwe’s neighbors and others must contribute.Unfortunately, South Africa’s show of pique is unlikely to be enough to alter Mr. Mugabe’s behavior. His recent decision not to let former President Jimmy Carter and former U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan into Zimbabwe was another sign of his contempt for international opinion. Pretoria must quickly rally African and world leaders to bring serious pressure on the aging dictator: denying visas to his cronies; freezing bank accounts and other assets; seeking other ways to show that the terrorizing of Zimbabwe will no longer be tolerated.'"
"'08-11-24,'1','PLATTEVILLE, Colo. (AP) — A farm couple received a big surprise when they opened their fields to anyone who wanted to take away vegetables left over from the harvest: 40,000 people showed up.The fields of the couple, Joe and Chris Miller, were picked so clean Saturday that a second day of harvesting was canceled Sunday, The Denver Post reported.“Overwhelmed is putting it mildly,” Ms. Miller said. “People obviously need food.”She said she expected 5,000 to 10,000 people to show up Saturday to collect potatoes, carrots and leeks. Instead, an estimated 11,000 vehicles snaked around cornfields and backed up more than two miles. About 30 acres of the 600-acre farm, 37 miles north of Denver, became a parking lot.“Everybody is so depressed about the economy,” said Sandra Justice of Greeley, Colo., who works at a technology company. “This was a pure party. Everybody having a great time getting something for free.”Ms. Justice and her mother and son picked about 10 bags of vegetables.Ms. Miller said she and her husband opened the farm for the public harvest for the first time this year after hearing reports of food being stolen from churches. It was meant as a thank-you for customers.The farm’s operations manager, Dave Patterson, said that in previous years the Millers had allowed schoolchildren and some church groups to harvest their own food on the farm in the fall.'"
"'08-11-24,'1','And the reports on Sunday that regulators were trying to help Citigroup may have a similar impact on the markets.“As far as the rest of the market, it could be positive,” said James Hardesty, president of Hardesty Capital Management, an asset management firm in Baltimore that sold its Citigroup stock in September. “It basically says the government is not going to let Citi fail. It’s not going to be another Lehman Brothers.”In trading early Monday in Asia, shares were down slightly. The Hang Seng index in Hong Kong fell 1.24 percent, and the S. &P./ASX 200 index in Australia was down about 0.8 percent. Markets in Tokyo were closed for a holiday.But investors were optimistic about American shares. December futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index had climbed 0.4 percent.Still, trading volume might be down in markets in the United States this week, because of the Thanksgiving holiday, and that could cause greater volatility among stock prices.Although the government’s actions may help the broader market, the question remains whether they will help financial stocks. As the government injects money into banks and other financial companies, that provides stability to the broader system, which should help companies in other sectors. But the government money dilutes the value of pre-existing shares in the banks.Roy C. Smith, a professor of finance at New York University, said that bank stocks have been driven lower by the government’s infusion of capital, and many shareholders view that as a step toward nationalizing the banks.“You’re going to have the total amount of shares owned by the government be a pretty large amount,” Mr. Smith said. “The rest of the shareholders have to divide what remains. All the stockholders are being squeezed into a much smaller house.”But some analysts said the government’s plan might help Citigroup, simply by removing the uncertainty about what other problems might lurk on the financial conglomerate’s balance sheet. Banks of all sizes are plagued by investors’ concerns about the unknowable risks they face as all sorts of arcane assets sour.“It is the lack of transparency that is the biggest problem,” Charles Geisst, a Wall Street historian at Manhattan College, said on Sunday afternoon. “God knows what other time bombs are out there.”The new program, which could become a model for an industrywide plan, raises about as many questions as it answers, and it may not stave off future problems at the banks. It remains unclear how the government would decide which assets to include in the program and how it would value the estimated losses.“Assets are devaluing on a daily basis,” said Meredith A. Whitney, a banking analyst with Oppenheimer & Company. “If they try to draw a line in the sand, there is no definitive line.”Even as the government provides a backstop to some of Citigroup’s losses, it is unclear whether regulators have considered all the types of assets that may cause future losses. Investors are increasingly concerned that commercial real estate investments will cause large losses at the banks — a prospect that bank executives dismissed out of hand just six months ago.James A. Wilcox, a former chief economist at the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, said the question to focus on was whether Citigroup was more valuable as a going concern or a tombstone on Wall Street. Though shareholders may lose out from the government’s steps, a failure of the bank could be worse, he said.“For the country as a whole, I think Citigroup is worth more alive than dead,” said Mr. Wilcox, who is now a professor at the Haas School of Business at the University of California, Berkeley.'"
"'08-11-24,'1','Mr. Rangel, a 19-term congressman, has been under scrutiny since July, when The New York Times reported that a developer had allowed him to lease rent-stabilized apartments, including one that he used as a fund-raising office, in violation of state regulations.He has since drawn criticism on other issues: his use of Congressional stationery to seek donations for a City University of New York school of public service that will bear his name; his failure to report on federal or state tax returns that he earned more than $75,000 in rental income from a villa he has owned in the Dominican Republic since 1988; and his failure to report that he had paid no interest for more than a decade on a mortgage extended to him to buy the villa.Republicans have criticized Mr. Rangel, claiming that he has made a mockery of the Democratic Party’s promise to reform Washington’s political culture when it took control of the House in 2006. Republicans have demanded that he step down as chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, which writes the nation’s tax laws and is one of the most powerful panels in Congress.Democratic leaders have dismissed that demand as being politically motivated. And Mr. Rangel, who is 78, has attempted to defuse the criticism by calling on a House ethics panel to review his various dealings and by assuring the public that he had “done nothing morally wrong.”Mr. Rangel has said that he never helped or even met the landlord who enabled the congressman to save thousands of dollars each year by allowing him to occupy several rent-stabilized apartments. He has also said he never used his power or public position to help any of the business leaders or foundations that he had asked to support the Charles B. Rangel Center for Public Service at CUNY.Mr. Rangel has described his failure to disclose his income from the beach villa — or pay taxes on it — as an unintentional oversight by his staff, his wife and himself. In September, he paid more than $10,000 in back taxes to the federal, state and city governments.'"
"'08-11-24,'1','BISSAU, Guinea-Bissau (AP) — The president of Guinea-Bissau survived what appeared to be a coup attempt after mutinous soldiers fought their way into his residence on Sunday and battled his guards for three hours.The soldiers attacked President Joao Bernardo Vieira’s home with heavy artillery fire shortly after midnight, killing at least one guard and wounding several others before security forces were able to push them back, Interior Minister Cipriano Cassama said. The attackers did not reach the room where Mr. Vieira was, and neither he nor his wife was hurt, Mr. Cassama said.In an afternoon news conference, Mr. Vieira said: “These people attacked my residence with a single objective: to physically liquidate me. No one has the right to massacre the people of Guinea-Bissau in order to steal power by means of the gun.”The walls of his fortified house were scarred with bullets and its floors littered with shell casings. But calm appeared to have returned to the capital, Bissau, and Mr. Vieira assured citizens that “the situation is under control.”Guinea-Bissau, an impoverished West African nation, has had multiple coups and attempted coups since Mr. Vieira seized power in 1980.

"'08-11-24,'1','That has meant cutbacks at publishers. In October, Condé Nast announced it would reduce Men’s Vogue from 10 issues a year to two, reduce the number of issues of Condé Nast Portfolio and cut magazine budgets by 5 percent. Niche Media, which publishes Gotham and Hamptons, laid off some employees and closed a shelter magazine. American Express Publishing, which owns Departures, Travel & Leisure and Food & Wine, is laying off 4 percent of its staff.“It’s definitely an environment that most have never seen,” said Ed Ventimiglia, the publisher of Departures. “Everyone is very concerned and somewhat confused as to what they should do.”High-end advertising was one of the few strong advertising categories earlier in the year. Luxury ad spending in categories measured by Nielsen Monitor-Plus actually rose 6.7 percent through August of this year over last year, even as almost all other areas slashed their spending.Publishers did not miss that trend. In September, Dow Jones & Company introduced WSJ., a glossy magazine, to attract luxury advertisers, and The Washington Post introduced FW, a fashion magazine. The New York Times Company has said its style magazines are big revenue sources for the company, and magazine publishers like Hearst, Condé Nast and Niche Media have also bet that high-end consumption and advertisements would continue.For now, publishers are trying to persuade brands to maintain their ad commitments. More than half of affluent consumers have cut their spending on luxury products compared with a year ago, according to a study by Unity Marketing, a market-research firm. Those consumers’ confidence in the economy is the lowest it has been in five years.“The stereotype in our sector is the high-end luxury brands are Teflon to a recession, which, of course, is nonsense,” said Alexander Duckworth, the founder of Point One Percent, a New York City company that advises luxury brands on marketing. “Much more so than in a traditional recession, this has really hit quite hard at the top, and quite quickly at the top.”“We’re just seeing the very beginning of this,” Mr. Duckworth said.Ronald Jackson, the chief executive of Tradema of America, which markets and distributes Girard-Perregaux watches in the United States, said he was reducing his advertising budget in the United States by about 20 percent for the first quarter.“We have retailers that are saying, ‘You know what? We have this on order, but we need you to not ship it until things get better,’ ” Mr. Jackson said. “We have to react in some way.”Graff Diamonds, the London-based retailer, is also cutting its budget. “We’re definitely not taking on any new advertising, and we’re cutting back on all our current advertising,” a Graff spokeswoman said. She declined to specify a figure, but said the cuts were higher in the United States than in Britain.Brioni, the Italian fashion line, will cut its advertising by 10 to 15 percent in United States publications, said Antonella De Simone, the co-chief executive.Other high-end projects, and the advertising that would accompany them, are being delayed or canceled. General Motors is postponing the introduction of the Buick LaCrosse until January, Ford is holding off redesigning its Volvo S60 sedan and XC90 sports-utility vehicle, and Chrysler has stopped production on its Aspen hybrid sports-utility vehicle. Orient-Express Hotels canceled new buildings in Miami; Cartagena, Colombia; Zambia; and Puglia, Italy. Donald Trump is postponing a $300 million development in Philadelphia, and the Ritz-Carlton Hotel Company has halted projects in Florida, Vancouver and California.“What the first salvo seems to be, going into 2009, is luxury advertisers — who will go unnamed — are trying to take advantage of the negative news in the market in order to secure a more favorable rate,” said Jim Taylor, the publisher of Town & Country, a Hearst magazine.“It would be a reasonable argument if our costs weren’t going up dramatically, but we’re affected by the same things they’re affected by,” he said. “Paper’s way up, postal’s way up.”Mr. Taylor said he was expecting smaller brands, in particular, to reduce the number of ads they would run in his magazine.At Condé Nast Traveler, advertisers are being slow to commit, and financial services and real estate ads are plummeting, the publisher, Lisa Hughes, said.Michael Rooney, the chief revenue officer of Dow Jones & Company, the News Corporation division that publishes the Wall Street Journal and WSJ., said luxury advertising in the newspaper was about flat. There were 51 advertisers in the premiere issue of WSJ., he said, and 52 so far in the second issue, which comes out in December.Luxury advertising in The New York Times has been “very stable” this year, said Denise Warren, senior vice president and chief advertising officer at The New York Times Media Group. She said the holiday issue of the fashion publication T Magazine was up by one page of advertising compared with last year. Still, she said, “there is absolutely nervousness in the marketplace.”And Mr. Ventimiglia of Departures said the January issue was down in ad pages.“A page here and a page there add up,” Mr. Ventimiglia said, “even though many lost pages are a result of delayed budgets, and we’re taking a hit.”Though luxury brands are reducing advertising, many continue — quietly — to spend on client dinners and launch parties, which they view as directly affecting sales. But the events may not erase economic concerns.In October, the Swiss watch brand Vacheron Constantin hosted a party to promote a new line of watches, some costing as much as $60,000. Inside the event, it seemed like precrisis times: waiters passed trays of lobster wrapped in zucchini and beef en croûte, and filled glasses with Moët & Chandon champagne.“As of today I think it would be wrong to stop everything because of the crisis,” said Julien Tornare, the president of Vacheron Constantin North America, in an interview. “Of course we will adjust if we have to in the future, but right now we don’t want to react.”Two men in suits, sipping drinks, walked past one of the watches, mounted on a pedestal like a museum piece.“You see the watch?” one asked.“Nice little watch,” the other replied.“Yeah, it is,” the first one said.But they kept walking.'"
"'08-11-24,'1','Big banks say that their exposure to the auto industry is relatively small and that in any case most of the loans are secured by vehicles or other assets, which would help minimize any losses.But the true risks are difficult to ascertain because banks do not disclose much about their exposure. Of particular concern is the fate of billions of dollars of bonds that were used to finance the 2007 acquisition of Chrysler by a large private investment fund, Cerberus Capital Management.The potential losses do not end with those high-risk loans, however. Over the past three years, as the auto industry’s fortunes darkened, big banks like Bank of America, Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase helped the automakers sell more than $56 billion of new debt securities, according to Dealogic. Most of those securities were bought by investors like insurance companies, pension funds and hedge funds, many of which have been staggered by losses on other investments. Some hedge funds already have been forced to dump investments into a falling market to meet demands.That figure does not include $47 billion of risky loans made to various affiliates of Chrysler, Ford and G.M. that are backed by auto leases and car loans to individual car buyers, some of whom are now struggling to pay their own bills as the economy craters.Many of these auto bonds and loans have plummeted in value as things have gone from bad to worse for Detroit’s once-proud carmakers. A $7 billion term loan that Ford issued in 2006, for instance, was trading for 32 cents on the dollar late last week in the secondary, or resale, market. That is particularly worrisome given that this debt would be the first to be repaid in the event that Ford filed for bankruptcy.But businesses and ordinary people all the way down the automotive food chain are shouldering a lot of debt too. That includes autoworkers, but also everyone from makers of car stereos to dealerships to parts suppliers, as well as the people who work for those companies. Many of these borrowers could run into trouble if the automakers implode, leaving lenders in the lurch.“The bigger fear is banks’ indirect exposure to suppliers and related companies in the auto industry,” said Ricardo Kleinbaum, an analyst at BNP Paribas in New York. “The real issue is the effect of an automaker bankruptcy on employment, credit card payments and mortgage defaults in the regions that are affected.”A big worry is whether banks that have extended loans or underwritten bonds for the auto industry have held on to this debt or sold it to other investors. Banks typically retain a small portion of the securities they underwrite, and many banks that had hoped to sell high-risk loans have been unable to find buyers for them since the credit markets froze over.“The question is, how much of these loans have they retained on their balance sheet?” said Tanya Azarchs, a credit analyst at Standard and Poor’s Ratings Service.Few doubt that banks are sitting on billions of dollars of loans to the industry, though. Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase and Morgan Stanley were among the banks that arranged $11.5 billion in financing for Cerberus’s takeover of Chrysler. Analysts say the banks are stuck with much of that debt.And then there is GMAC, the finance arm of G.M. GMAC, which is half-owned by Cerberus, applied last week to become a bank holding company in hopes of qualifying for the government’s bank rescue.In 2005, when banking was still strong, Bank of America bought $55 billion in loans from GMAC and then sold most of them to other investors. In June, the bank, which has itself received billions of dollars from the government, helped GMAC refinance $60 billion of debt.'"
"'08-11-24,'1','Some residual counterintuitive strokes remain on Mr. Cook’s self-titled major debut album. But largely he stakes firm and unusually appealing claim to territory few covet: middlebrow ’90s rock, one part hard and one part alternative, an unabashed mix of heft and melody. On “Idol” he covered bands like Our Lady Peace and Collective Soul, much to the distaste of Simon Cowell. But this is where Mr. Cook’s heart and vocal range live. (He wears his self-consciousness about his “Idol” win on his sleeve; his obligatory post-“Idol”-victory single, “The Time of My Life,” is buried as a bonus track a full 11 minutes after this album’s final song.)No amount of rasp can obscure Mr. Cook’s essential geniality, though, a limitation that turns out to be an asset. Like the genre he loves, Mr. Cook is hampered here by dim, amorphous songwriting (much of it contributed by members of his beloved ’90s bands). It’s only his broad, capable voice that redeems empty songs like “Declaration” and “Heroes,” and adds shade and texture to “Permanent,” about Mr. Cook’s relationship with his brother, who has cancer.On “Avalanche,” an otherwise punishing love song, Mr. Cook tries the opposite trick from his “Idol” playbook, slipping into dulcet mode for a few lines. It’s there too on parts of “Lie,” the album’s highlight, and also its best-written track. “Hold on to the past tense tonight,” he tells a lover on the verge of leaving. “Don’t say a word/I’m O.K. with the quiet.” Finally Mr. Cook has forgone the Howls for a third way, giving hope there could someday be a fourth, a fifth or even more. JON CARAMANICACountry music constantly strives to reconcile its rowdy good-ol’-boy side and its virtuous family-man side, and one well-traveled route to country success is to make the homey life still sound manly. Trace Adkins’s buzzing baritone and Deep South phrasing — he grew up in Louisiana before moving to Nashville — make him a stalwart voice of virtue on “X,” his 10th album (including two collections). After hits like the leering “Honky Tonk Badonkadonk” and the wistful “You’re Gonna Miss This,” and a stint on “The Celebrity Apprentice” (he was runner-up), Mr. Adkins has released his most confident, muscular sounding album. Produced by Frank Rogers, who’s also Brad Paisley’s producer, “X” touches the country bases along with Southern rock and even a piano-and-strings ballad, “I Can’t Outrun You,” that suggests Bruce Hornsby.Mr. Adkins doesn’t write songs, but he chooses carefully, and on “X” he prizes commitment. In most songs the narrator proclaims loyalty: to his wife, his family, his country and God. The album’s first single, an anthem called “Muddy Water,” is about a new start through baptism, while in “Happy to Be Here,” the singer looks back on a reckless life and insists he’s relieved to be “wrapped in your loving arms/just like an answered prayer.”When he’s lusty, he’s still monogamous, as when he plays a truck driver speeding home in “Hauling One Thing” or tries to rekindle desire with his wife in “Let’s Do That Again,” over a steadfast soul beat by way of Al Green and the Eagles. Even after a romance breaks up, Mr. Adkins’s devoted characters have a hard time moving on.While he sings about settling down and plays to his well-defined audience — Southern, rural or suburban and well past adolescence — Mr. Adkins evades the predictable. The album’s drinking song, a traditionalist country waltz called “Sometimes a Man Takes a Drink,” turns out to be about the perils of drinking.The folky “Till the Last Shot’s Fired” assumes the voices of soldiers killed in the Civil War and World War II (following through on a previous Adkins song about death on the battlefield, “Arlington”). At the end choral voices take over, praying for peace and adding, “Let us lay down our guns,” but warning, “We can’t come home till the last shot’s fired.” It’s the West Point Cadet Choir. JON PARELESTom Jones’s patented idea of macho camp was complex enough in the 1960s. But on “24 Hours” — his first album of new material in 15 years, though far from his first comeback — his performance goes further into the sincere-insincere hall of mirrors, a game of flamboyant posing that feeds on the love and outrage of the British media. This time it’s wrapped in imitation--antique R&B kitsch, with spun-sugar violins, horns, wah-wah guitars, chattering high-hat cymbals. His production team, Future Cut, has trained its focus on two targets, 40 years apart: Amy Winehouse fans and anyone fond of Mr. Jones’s 1960s big-beat pop origins.Some of the songs’ conceits were excellently counterblocked by British critics when they got their turn with the album a week ago. “Sugar Daddy,” written by Mr. Jones with U2’s Bono, is a frisky manifesto: Forget my age (68), feel my chest hair. “I got male intuition/I got sexual ambition,” he bellows. “I’m the last great tradition/let me state my position.” (“The effect is as immediate as swallowing a bad oyster,” declared Pete Paphides in The Times of London. He has a point.) In “The Road” Mr. Jones attempts dubious sensitivity, mollifying a cheated-on wife by insisting “what matters is here and now” (a line that “merits a saucepan to the temple,” Jude Rogers of The Guardian wrote).But by the halfway mark the album steadies itself. Claiming grown-up, thinking-man singer-songwriter territory (why not?), Mr. Jones sings some serious, unrepentant hard-guy narratives. He performs a version of Bruce Springsteen’s “Hitter,” redone in Southern soul, and a mysterious new song, “24 Hours” — a more morbid “My Way” — seems to come from the perspective of a life-sentence inmate. Throughout, Mr. Jones overdoes it of course. He can even make death musings banal. But his voice remains built for excess: it’s a great gargly instrument, heaving and overwrought as ever.

"'08-11-24,'1','The complex rescue plan calls for the government to back about $306 billion in loans and securities and directly invest about $20 billion in Citigroup. The plan, emerging after a harrowing week in the financial markets, is the government’s third effort in three months to contain the deepening economic crisis and may presage other multibillion-dollar financial rescues.Citigroup executives presented a plan to federal officials on Friday evening after a weeklong plunge in the company’s share price threatened to engulf other big banks. In tense, round-the-clock negotiations that stretched until almost midnight on Sunday, it became clear that the crisis of confidence had to be defused now or the financial markets could plunge further. Citigroup shares were up 66 percent on Monday, to $6.26.Whether this latest rescue plan will help calm the markets is uncertain, given the stress in the financial system caused by losses at Citigroup and other banks. Each previous government effort initially seemed to reassure investors, leading to optimism that the banking system had steadied. But those hopes faded as the economic outlook worsened, raising worries that more bank loans were turning sour.Mr. Obama was also working over the weekend to shore up confidence in the rapidly faltering economy. Mr. Obama signaled that he would pursue a far more ambitious plan of spending and tax cuts than he had outlined during his campaign and planned to announce his economic team on Monday. Some Democrats in Congress, meantime, were calling for the government to spend as much as $700 billion to stimulate the economy over the next two years. The Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, was involved in the discussions.Mr. Obama’s choice for Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, played a crucial role in the negotiations on Friday but took a less active role once news of his appointment was circulated. While the initial focus of government officials was to help the embattled company, they may also seek to draw up an industrywide plan that could help other banks.The plan could herald another shift in the government’s financial rescue. The Treasury Department first proposed buying troubled assets from banks but then reversed course and began injecting capital directly into financial institutions. Neither plan, however, restored investors’ confidence for long.“By intervening, they are giving the market some heart to temporarily stave off some fear — but you can only push that so much,” said Charles R. Geisst, a financial historian and professor at Manhattan College.Banking industry officials said the decision to support Citigroup, while necessary, could draw a firestorm of criticism from institutions that were not so big that their potential failure was considered a threat.Under the agreement, Citigroup and regulators will back up to $306 billion of largely residential and commercial real estate loans and certain other assets, which will remain on the bank’s balance sheet. Citigroup will shoulder losses on the first $29 billion of that portfolio.Any remaining losses will be split between Citigroup and the government, with the bank absorbing 10 percent and the government absorbing 90 percent. The Treasury Department will use its bailout fund to assume up to $5 billion of losses. If necessary, the F.D.I.C. Corporation will bear the next $10 billion of losses. Beyond that, the Federal Reserve will guarantee any additional losses.In exchange, Citigroup will issue $7 billion of preferred stock to government regulators. In addition, the government is buying $20 billion of preferred stock in Citigroup. The preferred shares will pay an 8 percent dividend and will slightly erode the value of shares held by investors.The government said it was taking the step to bolster the economy while protecting taxpayers. “We will continue to use all of our resources to preserve the strength of our banking institutions and promote the process of repair and recovery and to manage risks,” the regulators said in a joint statement on Sunday.Inside Citigroup’s Park Avenue headquarters, the mood was tense. Through the weekend, Robert E. Rubin, the former Treasury secretary and an influential executive and director at Citigroup, held several discussions with Mr. Paulson.Vikram S. Pandit, Citigroup’s chief executive, spoke to regulators and lawmakers. Mr. Pandit also met with Citigroup’s board on Saturday, and there was no indication that they would seek to replace him.Once the nation’s largest and mightiest financial company, Citigroup lost half its value in the stock market last week. Although Citigroup executives maintain the bank is sound, investors worry that its finances are deteriorating. Citigroup has suffered staggering losses for a year now, and few analysts think the pain is over. Many investors worry that it needs more capital.With more than $2 trillion in assets and operations in more than 100 countries, Citigroup is so large and interconnected that its troubles could spill over into other institutions. Citigroup is widely viewed, both in Washington and on Wall Street, as too big to be allowed to fail.Citigroup executives reached out to the Federal Reserve and the Treasury last week as they sought to stabilize the company’s stock price. All major bank stocks have been battered in recent weeks, including those of Bank of America, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase and Morgan Stanley.Citigroup’s shares have been hit particularly hard. A year ago they were trading at about $30; on Friday they closed at $3.77.The plan under discussion is reminiscent of the one that Citigroup and the F.D.I.C. worked out in October with Citigroup’s proposal to buy the Wachovia Corporation. That deal fell through, however, when Wells Fargo swept in with a higher offer.Under that plan, Citigroup agreed to bear a certain level of Wachovia’s losses, with the federal agency absorbing the rest. In exchange, Citigroup agreed to give the F.D.I.C. preferred stock.It is also similar to an effort orchestrated by Swiss financial regulators for UBS, another big global bank. Last month, the Swiss central bank and UBS reached an agreement to transfer as much as $60 billion of troubled securities and other assets from UBS’s balance sheet to a separate entity.'"

"'08-11-25,'1','An Iraq war veteran struggles to integrate back into a world that has no place for him in “Geometry of Fire,” a low-key drama by Stephen Belber that opened on Monday night at the Rattlestick Playwrights Theater.Kevin O’Donnell gives a quietly compelling performance as Mel Anderson, an ex-marine back just four months after two tours and now living with his father in an apartment outside Washington. His father, Bob (Jeffrey DeMunn), gently encourages Mel to seek psychiatric care to shake him out of his emotional torpor, but the tension between them goes deeper. The liberal Bob opposed the war and was mystified when his son, an economics major and former financial analyst, enlisted. Mel resents that Bob does not see the honor in his service.This fraught relationship is set alongside the story of an Arab-American’s fight for justice for his dying father. Tariq (Donnie Keshawarz), who prefers the nickname T-Bone, has discovered that the house he grew up in, where his father now lies dying of a rare cancer of the blood, was built on a former testing ground for military weaponry. A class-action lawsuit has been filed by some in the neighborhood who believe the land is contaminated.The hard-edged intersection linking the two stories is articulated by Bob: “We are in a war about oil gussied up as a war about chemical weapons that were never found except here in the backyard of your Saudi father’s house!”Why is Bob talking to Tariq? As dramatic fate has it, Bob works for a company that tests the soil for the government. The two plots are further linked through the play’s fourth central character, Cynthia (Jennifer Mudge), Tariq’s new girlfriend, who tends bar at the dive just up the street from Mel and Bob’s apartment. Mel has been killing his afternoons with Jim Beam and beer, nurturing a quiet crush on the bartender at the same time.Mr. Belber, the author of several plays seen in New York in recent years, including “Match,” “McReele” and “A Small, Melodramatic Story,” writes fluid, naturalistic dialogue and shapes his characters with care. “Geometry of Fire” is hindered by the schematic, um, geometry of its plotting, but Mr. Belber’s primary theme — that we all have a responsibility to the world around us, even if it is not easily discerned — is smartly woven into the texture of the play. (Only occasionally does a character articulate it too bluntly.)'"

"'08-11-25,'1','“These were true environmental portraits,” Catherine Johnson said. “These people did not have publicists or handlers. They came in their own clothes, without makeup. He often said that environment is a psychological mirror.”Mr. Bissinger was born in 1914 in Cincinnati, where he began studying art at the Cincinnati Art Museum while in high school. He then moved to Manhattan and enrolled in the Art Students League, where he studied painting.After decorating windows for Lord & Taylor in the 1940s, he found work as a stylist for the Condé Nast photographic studios, where he worked with, and befriended, several of the staff photographers, including Irving Penn, George Hoyningen-Huene, John Rawlings and Cecil Beaton. Richard Avedon, one of several friends with whom Mr. Bissinger shared a cottage on Fire Island, encouraged him to take his own pictures, lending him cameras and his studio for his first test photographs. His first subjects were Avedon’s wife, Doe, and the writer James Baldwin.Lillian Bassman, the art director for Hearst magazines, gave Mr. Bissinger his first assignment, for the newly created Junior Bazaar. He soon began doing portraits and the occasional fashion shoot for Harper’s Bazaar, Vogue, Theater Arts and Town & Country, gravitating toward painters, poets and writers as subjects.“I was drawn to portraits of artists for the obvious reason,” he said. “Their world was more interesting to me than the fashion scene.”Many of his portraits and travel photographs appeared in the 12 issues of the short-lived but influential magazine Flair, edited by Fleur Cowles. As a staff photographer for Flair Mr. Bissinger photographed the Duke and Duchess of Windsor, John Wayne, John Ford, Gary Cooper, Colette and Katharine Hepburn. His work for Flair and Theater Arts was collected in “The Luminous Years” (Abrams, 2003).In the early 1950s Mr. Bissinger’s interests swung to politics, and he gradually abandoned photography. A onetime member of the Communist Party, he became active in several peace organizations. In the early 1960s, at a demonstration against air-raid drills, he met Judith Malina and Julian Beck, the founders of the Living Theater, and for several years took up his camera again to record their performances. As the Vietnam War heated up, however, he devoted nearly all his time to working as a draft counselor at the Greenwich Village Peace Center. Later, as a member of the War Resisters League, he crusaded for nuclear disarmament.He is survived by his son, David B. Fechheimer of San Francisco, and two grandchildren.Mr. Bissinger took many photographs at the Cafe Nicholson, the restaurant on East 58th Street he had created with Johnny Nicholson, a fellow window-dresser from Lord & Taylor. A favorite with artists and a launching pad for the chef Edna Lewis, it made a natural setting for a photograph illustrating an article in the first issue of Flair, “The New Bohemians.”“I do not know what effect the picture has on those who now look at it, but I think it perfectly evokes an optimistic time in our history that we’re not apt to see again soon,” Mr. Vidal wrote in Smithsonian magazine last year. “So study this picture, and see what optimistic people looked like as they began what they thought would be lifelong careers, and in some cases indeed lasted as we lost more and more of a country that is no country without Karl Bissinger to make art of it.”'"
"'08-11-25,'1','To say Mr. Buffett is among the world’s most respected investors is an understatement. Thousands descend on Nebraska every year to listen to his observations at Berkshire’s shareholder meeting, and dozens of books have been written about his buy-and-hold investing strategy. Companies acquired by Berkshire are considered best-in-breed — Goldman Sachs and General Electric sought such prestige when they announced investments by Mr. Buffett in September and October. (To secure his support, both agreed to pay millions of dollars in annual dividends to Berkshire.)During the 2008 presidential campaign, Mr. Buffett was more than an informal adviser to Senator Barack Obama: his name was invoked by both candidates as a bipartisan totem, meant to assure voters that the economy would get better.But Mr. Buffett’s primary business, Berkshire, has been tarnished. Class A shares in the company, whose core business is insurance, fell for nine straight days through Thursday and are down 38 percent for the year.The Class A shares rose Friday but fell Monday, to $87,500. That values Berkshire, which owns NetJets, See’s Candies and Fruit of the Loom, as well as shares in blue-chip companies like Coca-Cola and General Electric, at about $136 billion, a 37 percent decline from Berkshire’s $216 billion market value on Jan. 2.That decline has struck hard at Mr. Buffett’s personal fortune, a third of which is tied up in Berkshire stock. And it is a sign of the malaise that has gripped markets amid the most sweeping financial turmoil since the 1930s.“It is truly an extraordinary sign of the times that people appear to have lost faith in Buffett’s investing acumen and conservative nature,” Whitney R. Tilson, a hedge fund manager who owns Berkshire shares, said.In a recent interview on the Fox Business Network, Mr. Buffett professed little worry about Berkshire’s steep stock drop. “It’s happened to me three other times in my life, too,” he said, mentioning a 55 percent decline in 1974-75 and a 50 percent fall between 1998 and 2000.Yet Mr. Buffett’s stamp of approval has failed to work its former magic more often than not recently. In October, he publicly supported the government’s first proposed bailout plan — only to see the House of Representatives shoot it down. And despite his glowing appraisals of Goldman and G.E., the former has since fallen about 46 percent and the latter 38 percent.On paper, Berkshire’s core business appears to be performing in line with the rest of the market. The company’s third-quarter profit fell 77 percent from last year, hurt in part by the impact of two hurricanes on its insurance business and drops in the value of many of its stock investments. Still, Berkshire avoided the sort of risky bets that sank rivals like A.I.G., and its wide array of portfolio companies could help ensure that at least some of its businesses are doing well.Nonetheless, investors had become increasingly nervous about Berkshire’s derivative bets — in particular, those that gambled on targets for four major stock market indexes by 2019. Berkshire sold these private contracts to unknown investors, reaping $4.85 billion upfront.In the worst-case situation — that each index falls to zero then — Berkshire could have to pay as much as $35.5 billion when the contracts come due.Because of accounting rules, Berkshire has already had to mark down the value of those contracts by $6.73 billion. Many in the markets appeared to fear that Mr. Buffett had chased easy money and exposed his company to significant risk. Letters disclosed by the Securities and Exchange Commission on Friday show that the S.E.C. began asking Berkshire for more information on the contracts in June.Perhaps the most striking indicator of that concern was in Berkshire’s credit-default swaps, which protect buyers of those contracts against the company’s inability to meet its debt payments. Buying $10 million worth of that protection cost $490,000 on Thursday, nearly double what the cost was on Nov. 6, according to data from CMA DataVision. On Jan. 1, that same protection would have cost $32,600. (On Monday, the cost of that protection fell to $365,000.)But Mr. Buffett has said Berkshire does not have to post collateral on those derivative contracts until they expire in at least 10 years, yielding no exposure to potentially enormous payments until 2019. Mr. Tilson, the hedge fund manager, predicted that Mr. Buffett “will not have to pay out a single dollar” on those derivatives, adding that the rising swap prices might stem from the illiquid market for those instruments. Mr. Tilson added that Berkshire had invested in derivatives like these before.And while Berkshire’s credit-default swaps have jumped in price, the company’s bonds have not shown any signs of distress, with none trading below 95 cents on the dollar. That suggests that bond investors consider the likelihood of a Berkshire default highly unlikely.Mr. Tilson said some of the selling in Berkshire shares came from institutional investors like mutual funds, some of which needed to raise cash to meet investor redemption requests.Some investors say that the drop in Berkshire’s stock has its upside.“I hope I don’t run out of cash before I get a chance to acquire more wonderful shares in Berkshire,” Frank Betz, a partner at Carret Zane Capital Management, said.As for Mr. Buffett, he conceded to Fox Business Network that he had made mistakes in the past. But, he added, so what?“If you don’t make mistakes, you don’t get out of bed in the morning,” he said. “That doesn’t bother me at all.”'"
"'08-11-25,'1','In a move that could help woo three Democrats whose votes will determine which party will control the New York State Senate next year, Republicans are planning to grant more autonomy and power to key committees, officials said on Monday.The most striking change will involve the Senate Finance Committee, which plays a major role in budget planning and has the power to approve all of the governor’s nominations to top executive branch jobs. Under the plan, the Finance Committee would be given its own funds in the state budget, allowing it to operate almost independently from the rest of the Senate. Traditionally in the Legislature, committee leaders are effectively figureheads who defer to the Senate and Assembly leaders.But the change would also empower Senate Republicans to offer an especially attractive post to one of the three Democrats — Senators Rubén Díaz Sr. and Carl Kruger and Senator-elect Pedro Espada Jr. — who have not yet committed to supporting Malcolm A. Smith, the Senate’s top Democrat. Mr. Smith needs their votes to become majority leader when the Senate meets in January.John E. McArdle, a Senate Republican spokesman, said that the overhaul was intended to provide “a more bipartisan basis for functioning” and could extend to other committees, allowing rank-and-file members of both parties to participate more.The changes to the Finance Committee, Mr. McArdle said, would restore some of the independence he said that it had enjoyed in past decades, when it had its own budget and more staff members.'"
"'08-11-25,'1','Mr. Horvitz, an artificial intelligence researcher at Microsoft Research, said many people treated search engines as if they could answer questions like a human expert.“People tend to look at just the first couple results,” Mr. Horvitz said. “If they find ‘brain tumor’ or ‘ ,’ that’s their launching point.”Mr. Horvitz is a computer scientist and has a medical degree, and his fellow investigator, Ryen W. White, is a specialist in information retrieval technology.They found that Web searches for things like headache and were just as likely or more likely to lead people to pages describing serious conditions as benign ones, even though the serious illnesses are much more rare.For example, there were just as many results that linked headaches with brain tumors as with caffeine withdrawal, although the chance of having a brain tumor is infinitesimally small.The researchers said they had not intended their work to send the message that people should ignore symptoms. But their examination of search records indicated that researching particular symptoms often led quickly to anxiousness.They found that roughly 2 percent of all Web queries were health-related, and about 250,000 users, or about a quarter of the sample, engaged in a least one medical search during the study.About a third of the subjects “escalated” their follow-up searches to explore serious illnesses, the researchers said.Of the more than 500 Microsoft employees who answered a survey on their medical search habits, more than half said that online medical queries related to a serious illness had interrupted their day-to-day activities at least once.Mr. Horvitz said that in addition to his interest in creating a Web search tool that would give more reliable answers, the research was driven by clear memories from his medical school education of what was often referred to as “second-year syndrome” or “medical schoolitis.”He said he remembered “sitting on a cold seat with my legs dangling off the examination table,” convinced that he was suffering from a rare and incurable skin disease.While the doctor was out of the room, Mr. Horvitz said, he took a look at his medical chart and saw that the doctor’s notes read, “Eric is in medical school, and he has been reading a lot.”The researchers said that Web searchers’ propensity to jump to awful conclusions was basic human behavior that has been noted by research scientists for decades.In 1974, the Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman wrote a seminal paper about decisions that are based on beliefs about the likelihood of uncertain events, like the outcome of an election or the future value of the dollar.They said that people usually employ common sense rules to aid in decisions. The rules can be quite useful, but they also frequently lead to systematic errors in judgment.The Microsoft researchers noted that reliance on the rankings of Web search results contributes a similar bias to the judgments people make about illness.At the same time, Mr. Horvitz said he believed that the Web would evolve to offer more reliable information.In the 1990s, Microsoft researchers built a health advisory system for and child care. Mr. Horvitz said that in the future it would be possible to create search engines that were able to detect medical queries and offer advice that did not automatically make Web searchers fear the worst.'"
"'08-11-25,'1','ESPN cannot ignore the deep recession’s impact on advertising. But its subscriber revenue gives it an extraordinary cushion. ESPN charges cable and satellite operators an average of $3.65 a month per subscriber, the most in television, according to SNL Kagan, a research organization. Multiply that by 98 million subscribers, over 12 months a year, and ESPN’s financial armor adds up to $4.3 billion.“What we have done is built a very successful business,” Skipper said. “But the last time I checked, we did it during a period of time that everybody had the opportunity to do so. We’ve got a plethora of critics who make it sound like this was bequeathed to us. All the people we compete with have cable assets.”Hill said: “That’s their business model. It is what it is. I can’t say it’s unfair.”Despite ESPN’s billions in subscriber fees, Skipper said that each deal must stand on its own. “It isn’t sitting in a pile in a drawer where I can reach in and use it,” he said.No surcharge will be added to subscriber fees to pay for the B.C.S. contract, he said.Still, said Ken Schanzer, the president of NBC Universal Sports: “If we bid against ESPN or any cable network, based on what we can generate from ad revenues — which represents the audience we think we can command — we would win every bid.”ESPN’s built-in advantages lead inevitably to what sport it will target next.Currently, it carries “Monday Night Football” (albeit without playoff games), the N.B.A., Major League Baseball, vast quantities of college football and basketball, a piece of all four tennis majors and a huge array of other sports. Earlier this month, it snared the rights to the British Open, taking what was on TNT and its sister network, ABC. Now after years of being shared by a broadcaster and a cable network, it is all on cable.“Where’s the ceiling?” asked Kevin O’Malley, a former B.C.S. adviser and also a former Turner and CBS Sports executive. “They have so much sports inventory, they can make sponsors happy and generate real advertiser premiums.”ESPN has voiced its desire to acquire Olympic rights for 2014 and 2016, which would probably put it up against NBC, the longtime incumbent, and Fox, which has craved them since losing out on the 2000 Sydney Games. The economic crisis will almost certainly delay the International Olympic Committee’s timetable, but when it asks for bids, will ESPN unfurl a bankroll no rival can match, or will the I.O.C. seek comfort with NBC?“We still have to make a calculation on whether it would drive up revenues,” Skipper said. “It does us no good to acquire something to drive our margin down.”The World Series would fit perfectly into ESPN’s matrix. Tim Brosnan, M.L.B.’s executive vice president for business, cagily told The Sports Business Journal last week that if the Series ever went to cable, “it means a lot of other sports have gone there first.”Broadcast networks regularly note that sports leagues and organizations like the I.O.C. risk losing viewers when a property moves to cable, simply because 114 million broadcast households can get broadcast TV and 98 million get ESPN. That gap is expected to narrow by February after the nationwide shift to digital from analog.But, O’Malley said: “Rights-holders aren’t looking askance at being on cable. ESPN is really institutionalized as a sports carrier.” Four years ago, he said, the B.C.S. did not care to see all the games on cable; this time around, it was not a concern. ESPN had the money.In sports television, it is rare for a league to take less than it had before. The N.C.A.A. can reopen its $6 billion men’s basketball championship deal with CBS three years before its conclusion in 2013 if more money is available, presumably from ESPN.Sean McManus, the president of CBS News and Sports, can see keeping the Final Four and title game and the rest going to cable. But he said, “I applaud ESPN for acquiring the events they covet, but it doesn’t mean we’re throwing in the towel against them.”Barry Frank, the executive vice president of IMG Sports Media and the B.C.S.’s negotiator, said, “The money was pretty predominant” in ESPN’s winning bid.And at Fox, which stunningly outbid CBS in 1993 to acquire N.F.L. rights, Hill knows how he was beaten. “It’s all money,” he said. “It’s all about the size of the check.”'"

"'08-11-25,'1','A federal judge dismissed three counts from the indictment against Barry Bonds that claimed that Bonds, baseball’s career home run leader, made false statements under oath about his use of performance-enhancing drugs.Bonds, who was scheduled to go on trial March 2 in United States District Court in the Northern District of California, still faced 12 counts related to his testimony in 2003 before a grand jury investigating the Bay Area Laboratory Co-operative.Lawyers for Bonds filed a motion to have 10 of the 15 counts dismissed, arguing that many of the counts overlapped and that the questions posed to Bonds before the grand jury were ambiguous. According to an order released Monday, a United States district judge, Susan Illston, said that federal prosecutors must also clarify one other charge before proceeding with the case.At the trial, the jury will be instructed to reach a verdict on each count.“In a high-profile perjury case like this, all the government needs to do to declare victory is get a single conviction,” said Daniel C. Richman, a professor of law at Columbia University and a former federal prosecutor. “The government has simply lost three opportunities to get a guilty verdict, but generally, these cases break one way or the other based on the jury’s overall impression of the defendant’s truthfulness.”PIRATES SIGN TWO FROM INDIA The Pittsburgh Pirates signed Rinku Singh and Dinesh Patel to free-agent contracts. Singh and Patel, both 20 and top finishers on the Indian reality television show “Million Dollar Arm,” are believed to be the first athletes from India to sign professional baseball contracts outside the country.Neither had picked up a baseball until earlier this year, and neither has taken the mound in a game situation.

"'08-11-25,'1','WASHINGTON — President Bush granted 14 pardons and commuted two prison sentences on Monday, but the beneficiaries included none of the big names who had become the topic of speculation as Mr. Bush leaves office.Mr. Bush has been relatively sparing in his use of pardons compared with past presidents, and the latest round of actions continued that pattern.The closest any of the defendants came to celebrity was John E. Forté, a hip-hop artist and backup singer to Carly Simon who was convicted of aiding and abetting in the distribution of cocaine. (Ms. Simon put up the bail of $250,000 for Mr. Forté when he was arrested in 2001 at Newark International Airport.) Mr. Forté was sentenced to 14 years in prison, but Mr. Bush commuted the remainder of his sentence.Amid a flurry of recent clemency requests that reached historic levels, a number of high-profile defendants have looked to Mr. Bush for help. They included Michael Milken, the former junk bond king convicted of securities fraud; Marion Jones, the former Olympic sprinter convicted for lying about her use of performance-enhancing drugs; Randy Cunningham, the former California congressman sent to prison in a bribery scheme; and John Walker Lindh, an American who pleaded guilty to serving with the Taliban.There has also been growing speculation in Washington that Mr. Bush might issue blanket pardons to government officials and intelligence officers who took part in counterterrorism programs like Qaeda interrogations, to protect them from the threat of criminal prosecution.'"

"'08-11-25,'1','The rising young Dutch mezzo-soprano Cora Burggraaf has been gaining attention with operatic roles and recital programs from London to San Francisco. Still, presenting her New York recital debut on Sunday afternoon at the Frick Collection was clearly a personal milestone. She traveled to the United States just for this one performance. And in a wide-ranging program of French and German songs, she sang beautifully.Yet there was one major complication. Because of a last-minute ruling from a regional immigration office, Ms. Burggraaf’s accompanist, the British pianist Simon Lepper, was denied a visa. As it routinely does, the Frick had applied for two visas well in advance. But the ruling, which came on Thursday, stated that these two artists had not performed together enough to make them a duo. So Ms. Burggraaf had to travel alone.Fortunately, the Frick found an impressive substitute, Jonathan Kelly, an experienced vocal accompanist currently on the faculties of the Yale School of Music and the Manhattan School of Music. Still, the ruling on the visa application is another example of the inexplicable assessments of the immigration agency regarding touring artists in a post-9/11 world. Ms. Burggraaf and Mr. Lepper have performed together several times. If two artists feel that they make a compatible duo, how can their judgment be questioned?Ms. Burggraaf’s warm, vibrant and dark-hued voice was well suited to a group of elegant and playful French songs by Bizet. At 31, Ms. Burggraaf still seems to be exploring the nature and dimensions of her voice. For a mezzo-soprano, her singing of low-lying phrases seemed somewhat breathy and cautious. Her upper range, though, was strong and gleaming.That she has sung traditional soprano roles like Mozart’s Zerlina and Stravinsky’s Anne Trulove suggests that Ms. Burggraaf is still straddling the soprano-mezzo divide. The rich, deep colorings of her voice, used effectively in her sensitive account of Berlioz’s affecting song “La Mort d’Ophélie,” have probably led her coaches to recommend the mezzo-soprano repertory over all.In an intriguing contrast, Ms. Burggraaf followed the Berlioz with an involving group of songs by Chausson, beginning with his despondent setting of Shakespeare’s song for Ophelia (“Hamlet,” Act IV, Scene 5), translated by Maurice Bouchor.After intermission Mr. Kelly displayed his crisp articulation and scurrying passagework in the challenging piano part to Mendelssohn’s “Neue Liebe” (“New Love”), a fleet, brilliant song that evokes the spirit of his Overture to “A Midsummer Night’s Dream.” Schumann’s setting of five short songs on poems and odes by Mary Queen of Scots was another rewarding novelty.'"
"'08-11-25,'1','The report’s publication is another embarrassment for the Communist Party, which has been striving to demonstrate its commitment to human rights. Last month, the government was infuriated by the European Union’s decision to honor Hu Jia, one of the country’s best-known dissidents, who is serving a three-and-a-half year prison term for subversion; last week, China was angered by a United States Congressional report that criticized what it called China’s failure to fulfill a pledge to improve human rights leading up to the Olympic Games and during them.“Illegal detentions and harassment of dissidents and petitioners followed the Chinese government and Communist Party’s instructions to officials to ensure a ‘harmonious’ and dissent-free Olympics,” the report said. “Individuals detained for circulating a ‘We Want Human Rights, Not Olympics’ petition are now serving sentences in prison and ‘re-education through labor’ centers.”Although China’s Constitution includes provisions to protect human rights and China has ratified numerous international conventions banning torture, public security officials frequently use coercion to gain signed confessions. “I have yet to see a political case in which the person was not tortured or mistreated,” said Nicholas Bequelin, a researcher based in Hong Kong for Human Rights Watch. Even though torture is technically illegal under Chinese law, he added, there is no explicit prohibition against evidence obtained through coercion.Human rights advocates say that the government’s crackdown on dissenters has not let up since the Games, when petitioners seeking permission to demonstrate in parks officially designated for protests were whisked away by the police.The most recent cases include that of Guo Quan, an associate professor at Nanjing Normal University, who was detained on Nov. 13 on suspicion of “inciting subversion of state power” after he established an independent political party. Earlier, Liu Xueli, a farmer from Henan Province whose land had been confiscated by local officials, sought a protest permit during the Olympics and was sentenced to re-education through labor.On Friday, a court in Chengdu handed down a three-year sentence to Chen Daojun, a journalist and environmental advocate who was convicted of “inciting to subvert state power.” Mr. Chen was detained in May after he published articles on the Tibetan quest for greater autonomy and the spate of anti-Western demonstrations that erupted across China after the Olympic torch relay was disrupted by protesters in Paris, London and San Francisco.Although prosecutors accused Mr. Chen, 40, of slandering the Communist Party, his lawyer, Zhu Jiuhu, suggested that the authorities might have been especially irked by Mr. Chen’s participation in a demonstration this year opposing the construction of a petrochemical plant near Chengdu. Mr. Zhu said he was denied access to his client; the trial, he added, lasted less than an hour. “We tried our hardest,” he said.In an interview on Monday, Mr. Chen’s wife, Zeng Qirong, said she had not seen her husband since he was taken into custody. She said he had often written literary criticism or articles about rural life.The detention, she said, would be particularly onerous for the couple’s 10-year-old son and Mr. Chen’s sickly parents. “The process was not fair,” she said of the trial. “They were only articles. It was his own opinion. He was only describing the way society is.”'"
"'08-11-25,'1','“Rosiglitazone was associated with greater mortality,” said Dr. Wolfgang C. Winkelmayer, assistant professor of medicine at the Harvard Medical School and first author of the study, published in The Archives of Internal Medicine.The study published today is an observational study, and officials at GlaxoSmithKline, which manufactures rosiglitazone, dismissed the findings, saying they are inconsistent with evidence from more rigorous randomized clinical trials.These include interim results reported from a six-year trial involving 4,447 patients, which company officials noted has found no significant increases in deaths from cardiovascular disease or other causes in patients taking rosiglitazone.Although the current study also found no differences in heart attack and stroke rates, Dr. Winkelmayer suggested the higher death rates among patients taking rosiglitazone may be due to underlying cardiovascular disease that was never diagnosed in the elderly patients, whose average age was 78.“In much older adults, it is possible if they do have a stroke or myocardial infarction, they might actually die immediately and never make it to the hospital for a diagnosis, so the excess cardiac events might show up as deaths,” Dr. Winkelmayer said.Dr. John Buse, chief of endocrinology at the University of North Carolina School of Medicine and president of the American Diabetes Association, said the new study is important but limited.“This is about the tenth report suggesting that rosiglitazone is associated with excess cardiovascular problems,” he said. “We don’t have proof yet.”Both the American Diabetes Association and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes have removed rosiglitazone from lists of recommended treatments for type 2 diabetes.The consumer watchdog group Public Citizen went further last month, calling on the Food and Drug Administration to ban the drug and claiming that it causes liver failure, vision impairment and other serious side effects, in addition to heart problems.Dr. Sidney Wolfe, director of Public Citizen’s Health Research Group, said he hoped this study would be “the last nail in the coffin of this drug.”“The big attraction of these drugs is that they are insulin-sensitizing drugs and forestall the time when someone would have to go on to insulin,” Dr. Wolfe added. “But with a 15 percent excess mortality over even pioglitazone, which itself is dangerous, that doesn’t seem like a very good tradeoff.”A federal scientific advisory panel that reviewed rosiglitazone’s safety profile last year recommended that it remain on the market. Sales have plummeted, however.About one million Americans still take the drug, which helps control blood sugar by increasing the body’s sensitivity to insulin, often as part of a regimen that includes other diabetes medications.'"
"'08-11-25,'1','Peanut allergy is one of the most common allergies in the United States, afflicting up to 1.5 million Americans and killing about 100 people a year.To prevent an allergy from developing, doctors have recommended that small children and nursing mothers avoid peanuts. But recent studies questioned if early exposure limited the allergy or increased the risk, perhaps explaining a rise in allergies.The latest study, published in The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology, found that early exposure might provoke tolerance. The authors examined two populations of genetically similar children, more than 8,000 in all. In one group, most ate peanuts by 9 months; those in the other had little or no early exposure. The scientists found the unexposed children were six times as likely to develop the allergy.Dr. Robert A. Wood, a pediatric immunology expert at Johns Hopkins, said the research was intriguing but not final, and parents should be cautious. Some children may be genetically destined to be allergic. Parents should be on the lookout for infants who show allergies to other things or have a family history of allergy.Early exposure to peanuts may benefit some children, but it is still unclear.'"

Take a swig every time Mr. Chávez, Venezuela’s socialist-inspired president, or someone talking about him, says something that could just as easily have been said by or about Barack Obama.“People radicalized,” Margarita López Maya, a political scientist, explains about the election that brought Mr. Chávez to power in 1998. “They wanted something new, something fresh.”Teodoro Petkoff, publisher of an opposition newspaper, adds: “All the media supported him.

President-elect Barack Obama introduced his newly appointed squad of financial advisers at a noon press conference, and noted that he had discussed rescue efforts with President Bush.“There’s optimism that Obama is going to be involved on Day 1,” Mr. Conroy said — certainly a sentiment that the Obama camp was hoping to convey, after some criticized the executive branch for not showing a more active presence during the presidential transition period.Sentiment was positive enough that the market survived an early test: a report that showed home sales and prices declining in October.Home values fell last month at the fastest annual rate since the National Association of Realtors began keeping records in 1968, an indication that the pain currently pulsing through the housing market is not likely to abate soon.Sales of previously owned homes fell 3.1 percent for the month, to an annual rate of 4.98 million, according to the Realtors, a private trade group. Of the homes that did find buyers in October, nearly half were the result of a sale after a foreclosure.The nationwide median price of a home was $183,300, down 11.3 percent from October 2007.The housing slump is at the center of the credit crisis sweeping Wall Street, and while the poor sales report was not exactly good news, it did suggest that a recovery was under way.Buyers have been reluctant to enter the market, partly on the expectation that prices will fall further and partly because of a scarcity of mortgages.

"'08-11-26,'1','Like “Elephant” (suggested by the Columbine High shootings) and “Last Days” (by the suicide of Kurt Cobain), “Milk” is the chronicle of a death foretold. Before that subway station encounter, we have already seen real-life news video of the aftermath of Milk’s assassination, as well as grainy photographs of gay men being rounded up by the police. These images don’t spoil the intimacy between Harvey the buttoned-up businessman and Scott Smith (James Franco), the hippie who becomes his live-in lover and first campaign manager. Rather, the constant risk of harassment, humiliation and violence is the defining context of that intimacy.And his refusal to accept this as a fact of life, his insistence on being who he is without secrecy or shame, is what turns Milk from a bohemian camera store owner (after his flight from New York and the insurance business) into a political leader.“My name is Harvey Milk, and I want to recruit you.” That was an opening line that the real Milk often used in his speeches to break the tension with straight audiences, but the film shows him deploying it with mostly gay crowds as well, with a slightly different inflection. He wants to recruit them into the politics of democracy, to persuade them that the stigma and discrimination they are used to enduring quietly and even guiltily can be addressed by voting, by demonstrating, by claiming the share of power that is every citizen’s birthright and responsibility.The strength of Mr. Black’s script is that it grasps both the radicalism of Milk’s political ambition and the pragmatism of his methods. “Milk” understands that modern politics thrive at the messy, sometimes glorious intersection of grubby interests and noble ideals. Shortly after moving with Scott from New York to the Castro section of San Francisco, Milk begins organizing the gay residents of that neighborhood, seeking out allies among businessmen, labor unions and other groups.The city’s gay elite, discomfited by his confrontational tactics, keeps Milk at a distance, leaving him to build a movement from the ground up with the help of a young rabble-rouser and ex-hustler named Cleve Jones (Emile Hirsch).For more than two lively, eventful hours, “Milk” conforms to many of the conventions of biographical filmmaking, if not always to the precise details of the hero’s biography. Milk’s inexhaustible political commitment takes its toll on his relationships, first with Scott and then with Jack Lira, an impulsive, unstable young man played by Diego Luna with an operatic verve that stops just short of camp.Meanwhile, local San Francisco issues are overshadowed by a statewide anti-gay-rights referendum and the national crusade, led by the orange-juice spokesmodel Anita Bryant, to repeal municipal antidiscrimination laws. The culture war is unfolding, and Milk is in the middle of it. (And so, 30 years later, in the wake of Proposition 8, is “Milk.”)“Milk” is a fascinating, multi-layered history lesson. In its scale and visual variety it feels almost like a calmed-down Oliver Stone movie, stripped of hyperbole and Oedipal melodrama. But it is also a film that like Mr. Van Sant’s other recent work — and also, curiously, like David Fincher’s “Zodiac,” another San Francisco-based tale of the 1970s — respects the limits of psychological and sociological explanation.Dan White, Milk’s erstwhile colleague and eventual assassin, haunts the edges of the movie, representing both the banality and the enigma of evil. Mr. Brolin makes him seem at once pitiable and scary without making him look like a monster or a clown. Motives for White’s crime are suggested in the film, but too neat an accounting of them would distort the awful truth of the story and undermine the power of the movie.That power lies in its uncanny balancing of nuance and scale, its ability to be about nearly everything — love, death, politics, sex, modernity — without losing sight of the intimate particulars of its story. Harvey Milk was an intriguing, inspiring figure. “Milk” is a marvel.“Milk” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has some profanity, brief violence and a few discreet sex scenes.Opens on Wednesday in New York, Los Angeles and San Francisco.Directed by Gus Van Sant; written by Dustin Lance Black; director of photography, Harris Savides; edited by Elliot Graham; music by Danny Elfman; production designer, Bill Groom; produced by Dan Jinks and Bruce Cohen; released by Focus Features.

"'08-11-26,'1','That Republicans and Democrats across the country strongly supported parks and open space preservation is certainly worthy of applause.Spending public money on green space is an investment that has long-term financial returns even Wall Street would envy.For example, reducing flood damage by preserving and rebuilding wetlands and using green space and porous surfaces to absorb seasonal high water events can save large public and insurance expenditures in repairs.The new Congress and president have a number of difficult tasks ahead. But continuing the voters’ trend to be more supportive of open space and greenery might be among the easier tasks they have to tackle.One piece of legislation that is supported by the American Society of Landscape Architects is H.R. 5867, the Energy Conservation Through Trees Act of 2008, introduced by Representative Doris Matsui of California. It would improve air quality and lower the need for energy consumption through a grant program using targeted residential tree planting to reduce energy usage.'"

"'08-11-26,'1','The first operational audit of the $700 billion financial rescue plan, to be delivered to Congress next Tuesday, is expected to be critical of the Treasury Department’s failure to set up ways to track how its bailout money is being used in the marketplace, according to people briefed on a draft of the report.The audit, done by the Government Accountability Office, is also likely to call for tighter controls over the conflicts of interest that are arising as financial specialists, institutions and law firms are hired for Treasury work that could later aid their private-sector clients, said these people, who would speak only on condition of anonymity because the briefings were confidential.But the overall assessment was “a mixed bag,” as one person put it. It was clear, he said, that the auditors took into account how quickly the program was carried out, how much its focus shifted over time and how little feedback Treasury has had from oversight agencies so far.The pending audit is a milestone for the rescue program because the G.A.O. is, in effect, the “first responder” in the oversight effort. Within days of the plan’s enactment on Oct. 3, the agency had assembled a 20-member team of lawyers, accountants, contracting experts, ethics monitors and market regulation specialists to start tracking the Treasury Department’s work.The two other elements of the oversight machinery created by the law are still works in progress. A federal prosecutor from New York, Neil M. Barofsky, has been nominated as the special inspector general for the program, but he is still awaiting Senate confirmation. And the last two appointments to the five-member Congressional oversight panel set up under the law were made only last week.'"
"'08-11-26,'1','There is a similarly attractive group of free agents available this year — C. C. Sabathia, Mark Teixeira, Manny Ramírez and Francisco Rodríguez, for starters — but teams seem to be proceeding cautiously and dispensing fewer offers than in years past.Some baseball executives have suggested that many teams, unsure of how long it will take for the economy to rebound, are reluctant to offer expensive multiyear deals.It is unclear how well baseball is insulated from the country’s economic troubles, but it is clear that people in the sport are concerned. Commissioner Bud Selig invited the former chairman of the Federal Reserve, Paul Volcker, to speak to owners and executives last week. The Boston Red Sox, for the first time in 14 years, froze their regular-season ticket prices.In a more modest gesture, the Yankees on Tuesday announced that they would not raise ticket prices for spring training home games in Tampa, Fla., next March; those prices range from $17 to $31. (The ticket prices for the first season in the new Yankee Stadium are a different story.) The Red Sox said they would do the same for their 2009 spring-training games: tickets will remain in the $10 to $40 range.Player agents and front-office executives often speak of the domino effect that occurs after the premium free agent at his position makes a decision. For instance, as soon as Sabathia, the most coveted starting pitcher, chooses where he will play for the next six or so years, interest in the other top starters — A. J. Burnett, Derek Lowe, Oliver Pérez and Ben Sheets — should sort itself out.In what may be a hint that movement will accelerate soon, The Los Angeles Times reported Tuesday that the Los Angeles Angels, protecting themselves in case they cannot re-sign Teixeira, were contemplating a bid that would come close to, or perhaps match, the Yankees’ six-year, $140 million offer to Sabathia.In all likelihood, elite players like Sabathia and Teixeira will not be affected by the economy; they will sign lucrative contracts at some point regardless of how many bankruptcies occur.Those who may feel the pinch more could be whoever is left, particularly if big-market teams, with an eye on the economy, draw a precise line on how much they will spend. In other words, drag things out as a free agent, and a player could miss out.It is for this reason that even an agent like Scott Boras, who is known for trying to play one team off another fairly deep into the off-season, may advise his clients to make a decision earlier than usual. Boras represents Teixeira, Manny Ramírez, Lowe, Pérez, Jason Varitek and Iván Rodríguez, among others. Perhaps they will all sign fairly soon. Or perhaps Boras will proceed as normal, and everything will take awhile.All that remains to be seen. What is clear is that baseball is very quiet right now. Maybe it’s not the economy. Or maybe it is.'"
"'08-11-26,'1','As seasonal fresh fruit choices dwindle, cooks turn to dried fruits to bake into pies and cakes, stew into compotes and enrich sauces. A newcomer, dried Asian pears, can be added to the selection.Asian pears grown in the Lehigh Valley in eastern Pennsylvania are the source of the smallish pieces of dried fruit, which are honey-sweet, with a hint of cinnamon in their flavor, making them also good for nibbling. They have no added sugar or sulfates, and can be used like dried apples in baking or added to the pan juices for sautéed chicken or sea scallops. They are excellent mixed with sautéed chanterelle mushrooms.The dried fruit is made by Subarashii Kudamono, a company started by an American entrepreneur to grow Asian pears. The company’s name means “wonderful fruit” in Japanese. The fruit is $4.95 for 4.2 ounces at Agata & Valentina; $7.95 plus shipping for two 4.2-ounce packages from baldorfood.com; and $12.95 for a pound and $9.95 for nine ounces, plus shipping, from wonderfulfruit.com.'"
"'08-11-26,'1','Mr. Obama’s committee has not put a price tag on the inauguration and is still wrestling with an array of details, not least the question of how much to pare the festivities in recognition of the nation’s economic crisis and the serious tasks ahead.Mr. Obama, who has been preoccupied with the economic woes as he prepares to step into the presidency, formed his inaugural committee only in recent days and announced its five co-chairmen on Tuesday.They are William M. Daley, commerce secretary under President Bill Clinton; Penny S. Pritzker, finance chairwoman of Mr. Obama’s presidential campaign; John W. Rogers Jr., founder and chief executive of the mutual fund company Ariel Investments; Patrick G. Ryan, a Republican who is in charge of Chicago’s efforts to host the 2016 Summer Olympics; and Julianna Smoot, the Obama campaign’s national finance director.Although the cost of the inaugural is as yet unclear, Linda Douglass, a spokeswoman for the committee, said Mr. Obama expected to incur expenses that past presidents had not, because he wanted to make as many events as possible accessible to the public.“We’re going to explore all kinds of creative ways to open this up to the public, everything from the swearing-in to the events,” Ms. Douglass said, adding that the celebration would include activities elsewhere in the country.“This inauguration is more than just a celebration of an election,” she said. “This is an event that can be used to inspire and galvanize the public to act. That is what we’re aiming for.”The committee is also working with federal officials to open to those attending the inauguration as much as possible of the Mall, which stretches two miles from the Capitol to the Lincoln Memorial. The section east of the Washington Monument has traditionally been used as a staging area for marching bands and others who participate in the inaugural parade, but they may be moved elsewhere this time to accommodate the crowds, most of whom will have to view the swearing-in ceremony and the parade on JumboTron screens.In modern times, inaugurations have been financed by a combination of public and private money. Most recently, in 2005, Mr. Bush spent a record $42.3 million on his inaugural events, most of it collected from corporations and executives. That money was directed mostly toward festivities, including fireworks, inaugural balls, the parade and a concert on the Mall.But the federal and District of Columbia governments also spent a combined $115.5 million, most of it for security, the swearing-in ceremony and cleanup; the biggest expense by far, $84 million, was to compensate federal workers for the holiday.In barring lobbyists from contributing, Mr. Obama is continuing a practice he began with his campaign and applied as well to his transition, in which contribution limits are $5,000.“Given his policies during the campaign, this is as consistent as you can write these rules and still raise the tens of millions of dollars that modern inaugurations have required,” said Sheila Krumholz, executive director of the Center for Responsive Politics, which tracks the influence of money in politics.Ms. Krumholz said she believed that Mr. Obama’s limits for the inauguration were stricter than those for any previous one. But, she noted, there are ways around the limits. Couples can give as much as $100,000 rather than $50,000, which itself is more than 10 times as high as the $4,600 maximum that individuals could donate for the primary and general-election campaigns together. And corporate executives can give as individuals, though their companies cannot. Moreover, many people lobby without being registered as lobbyists.In any event, the Obama team plans to call upon the hundreds of thousands of supporters who gave small-dollar amounts to the campaign, though it is anybody’s guess to what extent they will contribute this time.“Paying for other people to party in Washington doesn’t seem like something they might go for,” Ms. Krumholz said.One of the biggest unknowns for donors is whether they will get tickets to Mr. Obama’s swearing-in ceremony. There are a total of 240,000 tickets, most of them controlled by Congress, and already the requests have vastly exceeded the supply.'"
"'08-11-26,'1','Advisers to Mr. Obama and to Congressional leaders say they have hardly begun to figure out what kind of process they could devise to enforce fiscal discipline. But Obama advisers, in particular, consider it essential to signal that Democrats are not using the economic crisis to go on a spending binge without concerns for future deficits.“In these challenging times, when we are facing both rising deficits and a sinking economy, budget reform is not an option,” Mr. Obama said. “It’s a necessity.”Budget controls are also considered important to securing the votes of conservative Democrats in the House and the Senate, who might otherwise balk at an economic stimulus package that could exceed $500 billion. One of those at the center of the effort to draw up proposals is Rahm Emanuel, who was the fourth-ranking House Democratic leader until Mr. Obama tapped him to be the White House chief of staff.Mr. Obama, who on Tuesday passed the three-week mark of his election, is seeking to take a more forceful and visible role in the transition to power. He said he would not overstep his role as president-elect but added that Americans should know that he and his ever-growing circle of advisers were preparing to tackle the economic problems.“We don’t intend to stumble into the next administration,” Mr. Obama said.A briefing on Monday, followed by one on Tuesday with another set for Wednesday will triple the amount of time that Mr. Obama has spent in public view as president-elect. His aides limited the questions to four on Tuesday, but Mr. Obama spoke about his margin of victory in the most expansive way since the election.Mr. Obama called his triumph “decisive,” saying that voters were demanding change in Washington. He recorded 365 Electoral College votes to 173 for Senator John McCain, becoming the first Democratic presidential candidate in decades to win states like Indiana, North Carolina and Virginia.“I don’t think that there’s any question that we have a mandate to move the country in a new direction and not continue the same old practices that have gotten us into the fix that we’re in,” Mr. Obama said.“But I won 53 percent of the vote. That means 46 or 47 percent of the country voted for John McCain,” he added. “It’s important, as I said on election night, that we enter into the new administration with a sense of humility and a recognition that wisdom is not the monopoly of any one party.”The top Democratic and Republican leaders of the Senate Finance Committee issued a joint statement on Tuesday praising the selection of Mr. Orszag, calling him a smart and straightforward expert on the economy. Mr. Obama also said Tuesday that he would nominate Rob Nabors, the staff director of the House Appropriations Committee, to be Mr. Orszag’s deputy.Mr. Obama cited, as an example of the possible cuts he expects Mr. Orszag and the rest of his budget team to find, the findings of a recent government report indicating that farmers whose incomes exceeded $2.5 million had most likely been mistakenly paid about $49 million in government subsidies from 2003 to 2006.He did not offer any other specific targets, and by itself, correcting the problem with the farm program would make an undetectable dent in the government’s soaring deficits. After the financial recovery is under way, Mr. Obama said, the chase after wasteful spending will begin in earnest.“Just because a program, a special interest tax break or corporate subsidy is hidden in this year’s budget does not mean that it will survive the next,” he said. “The old ways of Washington simply can’t meet the challenges of today and tomorrow.”'"
"'08-11-26,'1','“I just wonder why the magazine had to handle it this way,” said Julian Niccolini, a partner at the Four Seasons restaurant. “Who else has had her longevity? And look what she’s done for Citymeals-on-Wheels.”Indeed, the luncheon raised a record $1.5 million, Ms. Greene said.Debate among the stomach-obsessed since then has veered from whether she was an arbiter of the evolution of American dining — a legend to whom respect must be paid — or a relict of a bygone era too cozy with chefs she reviewed.She was so cozy, in fact, that she wrote a book, “Insatiable: Tales From a Life of Delicious Excess” (Warner Books, 2006), indexing her artisanal affairs with everyone from star chefs (like Jean Troisgros and Gilbert Le Coze) to just plain stars (Clint Eastwood and Burt Reynolds).Before she relinquished her chief-critic role, there had been editors at New York who were stung by her pronouncements on which restaurants should be accorded how much attention, and Ms. Greene is still resented by some she criticized through the decades, none of whom agreed to say so for publication.But Robert Lape, restaurant critic for Crain’s New York Business, said that Ms. Greene’s “palate is one of the best in the business,” and that “she could always parse a meal quite brilliantly, and her skills have not diminished.”Her hold on celebrity chefs and their cellphones has not diminished, either. When interviewed for this article, Ms. Greene called Jean-Georges Vongerichten to ask if she could be photographed in his Jean Georges restaurant because “I love the light there,” she said. Mr. Vongerichten agreed, and met her at the shoot.She perseveres in her incognito fetish — wearing her trademark hats and averting her head near photographers because “I hope to be anonymous when I walk into a restaurant with my bare-naked face,” she said.Ms. Greene, a University of Michigan graduate who studied at the Sorbonne, said she was raised in a cocoon of Velveeta in Detroit, where she bedded Elvis Presley in 1956 as a U.P. reporter, as she tells it. (On the way out, she ordered The King a fried-egg sandwich from room service.)After she became a reporter for The New York Post and then a freelancer, the founding editor of the nascent New York, Clay Felker, made her his first restaurant reviewer only months after the magazine’s debut in 1968.“It was as if New York magazine had found its own version of Colette when it came to food,” Mr. Batterberry said. “She created an entirely fresh new voice, one that has never staled.”She also launched an assault on the rep-tie restaurant criticism of the 1960s. Ms. Greene trashed the sacrosanct “21” Club as boring and overpriced, and lobbed word grenades into Elaine’s when few would have dared. She celebrated not only Lutèce and Le Bernardin but also the snack bar in Paley Park on East 53d Street.Ms. Greene — who once wrote that “the two greatest discoveries of the 20th century were the Cuisinart and the clitoris” — said she has written about food as she has about sex: “How does it feel, how does it taste, and what is it about. If you are a sensuous eater, these things are important.”Some have thought of her at times as what celebrity-wranglers bemoan as “heavy furniture.” But in her reviews and books, “she laid bare her laying bare — the pure sensualist unleashed,” Mr. Lape said.Though often seemingly desperate for male attention in her public persona as a sort of forerunner Carrie Bradshaw, Ms. Greene was rejected by the old-boys’ network. Early on, her feminism was annealed by criticism from men who labeled her with such words as “housewife.”Her food-as-a-drug writing style offended others as overwrought. In 1982 the Washington Post critic Jonathan Yardley panned her erotic novel “Doctor Love,” saying that she was guilty of “terminal tackiness.”Adam Moss, New York’s editor in chief, said Ms. Greene “was laid off — there is no elegant expression for it” because New York could no longer afford four food critics. Adam Platt is the chief weekly reviewer and Robin Raisfeld and Rob Patronite write the Underground Gourmet column.Ms. Greene said that when Mr. Moss gave her the news last Wednesday: “It was narcissistic shock: moi? I thought I was a brand at New York magazine. I’m the only editorial person on the staff left from the earliest days.”Ms. Greene would not reveal her salary as a contributing editor, but it was less than $50,000, according to a friend who spoke on condition of anonymity because the information was confidential.Ms. Greene will continue critiquing food for her blog, and she said she will pay for what she eats. “It’s basic, a critic must always pay the bill,” Ms. Greene said. After she gave up the weekly critic role, she said, “I had a smaller expense account, so I paid from my salary.”But Ms. Greene said she does agree to free meals when she is “covering events, but not being a critic,” she said, including restaurants’ early “soft openings.” She made an exception, she said, writing in last week’s New York about a $1,500-a-person dinner at Per Se in Manhattan. “I was a guest,” she said. “I did not think of paying $1,500. Perhaps that was a flaw.”She has long walked that line. In 1986 Ms. Greene gave a party for her book, “Delicious Sex,” for 700 guests with a dozen restaurants supplying free food. “Asking chefs to do things for my book party was a mistake,” she said, “and I really regret it.”As for more racy conflicts of interest, Ms. Greene said that she solved — to her own satisfaction — the problem of reviewing chefs she’d had affairs with by sharing that knowledge with readers, as in her enthusiastic 1977 review of Le Cirque, titled “I Love Le Cirque, but Can I Be Trusted?” It revealed her liaison with the chef de cuisine, Jean-Louis Todeschini.Ms. Greene, who said she is childless by choice, lives with her partner of 22 years, Steven Richter, a New York photographer.What is next for her? “Dinner,” she said instantly. Then, more thoughtfully, she said that she would devote more attention to her blog, finish a children’s book she’s been writing and freelance “the next exciting food story.”She also hopes to stay youthful, she said: “I work out five days a week. And use lots of blue eye shadow.”“Even great wines don’t last forever,” she added. “But I’m not going to stop eating.”'"
"'08-11-26,'1','Parkcentral Capital Management, an investment firm that manages money for the family of Ross Perot, is liquidating a fixed-income hedge fund because it is “no longer viable.”This year through October, Parkcentral Global Hub’s assets fell as much as 40 percent, to $1.5 billion. The fund is selling its remaining holdings to pay creditors, Eddie Reeves, a spokesman, said Tuesday. Mr. Perot and members of his family were the fund’s biggest investors.“Parkcentral Global has been impacted dramatically by the unprecedented upheaval of the capital markets in general and the freezing of credit markets in particular,” Mr. Reeves said. ”The fund is no longer viable.”'"
"'08-11-26,'1','Naomi (Ania Bukstein), the stubborn heroine of “The Secrets,” a religious soap opera and feminist cri de coeur, is the brilliant, beautiful, headstrong daughter of a revered Orthodox Israeli rabbi (Sefi Rivlin). Exceptionally well schooled in Jewish law, she is the pride and joy of her father to the degree that she has shed no tears over the recent death of her chronically depressed mother.At first, the movie, directed by the Israeli filmmaker Avi Nesher from a screenplay he wrote with Hadar Galron, a London-born feminist playwright, actress and Orthodox Jew, is a sober exploration of limited female opportunities in a rigidly patriarchal environment. But after two French characters, one played by the great French actress Fanny Ardant, are introduced, the movie becomes an intriguing, occasionally discordant hybrid of austere Israeli and voluptuous French filmmaking traditions. Although the story remains in Israel, in spirit the movie migrates from the Middle East to France before returning to Israel for a pat, feel-good ending.As the film begins, Naomi entreats her father to postpone her coming marriage to his sour, self-righteous protégé Michael (Guri Alfi) so she can pursue her religious studies at a seminary for women in Safed, the birthplace of the Kabbalah. Her distant dream is one day to become the first female Orthodox rabbi in a culture in which the men smugly dismiss women’s conversations as “idle chat.”For as long as she is the apple of her father’s eye, Naomi feels valued within the Orthodox Jewish environment and entertains the possibility that it holds a place for her beyond one of blind subservience to male authority.Once Naomi enters the seminary, whose sympathetic headmistress shares her dream but advises patience, “The Secrets” steadily metamorphoses into a romantic tearjerker. Naomi’s arrogance and rigidity begin to break down when she forms a friendship with Michelle (Michal Shtamler), a sullen, chain-smoking Parisian student who is one of her three roommates.'"
"'08-11-26,'1','If the council’s position were adopted as it stands, charges for sending text messages across European borders would fall by an average of 62 percent from the current 29 euro cents, according to European Commission data. A similar percentage decline is possible in data roaming charges.“It’s good that the council is endorsing the data caps,” said Levi Nietvelt, an economist with the European Consumers’ Organization in Brussels. “We would like to see the prices go down even further.”Mobile operators have generally opposed the controls, arguing that the market should determine price levels.While supporting data roaming caps, the ministers plan to send a message to the European Parliament and to Ms. Reding by opposing the attempt to allow Brussels to exert a greater influence over telecommunications pricing.The national governments of two-thirds of member countries still own either a majority or a large stake in the former phone monopoly, which in many cases controls access to the main fixed-line network. In most European countries, the national telecommunications regulator works for the same government that owns a stake in the former phone monopoly.Ms. Reding’s proposed regulatory overhaul, which gained support from the European Parliament, was aimed at dealing with this situation, which she considers a conflict of interest.But the council intends to reject most elements of the regulatory package, which is also aimed at spurring cross-border competition among network operators.Instead of supporting Ms. Reding’s call for a powerful regulator, the council plans to propose that a current advisory panel of 27 national regulators, called the European Regulators Group, be transformed into a private corporation — similar to a lobbying group — that will try to address issues of coordination.Paul Rübig, a member of the European Parliament from Austria, who was a sponsor of the voice roaming legislation in 2007, said he was confident that Parliament and the ministers’ council would reach a compromise in the spring to create a new Europe-wide regulator.The ministers also are opposing a plan to compel countries to ensure that their national regulators remain free of local government influence, removing the word “independent” from the text approved by the commission and Parliament. The issue has gained prominence after the prime minister of Romania twice in three years dismissed the country’s top national telecommunications regulator.Malcolm Harbour, one of three sponsors in Parliament of the telecommunications legislation, said he was confident lawmakers would reach agreement with telecommunications ministers to pass a revised package into law.'"
"'08-11-26,'1','The work on the rotary joints, which roll on rings 10 feet in diameter, has been the kind of grueling and repetitive task that has characterized the mission. Three astronauts — Capt. Heidemarie Stefanyshyn-Piper and Capt. Steve Bowen of the Navy, and Lt. Col. Shane Kimbrough of the Army, spent nearly 54 hours altogether outside the station working largely on that task.The right-hand joint was damaged by a lubrication failure and had ground metal filings that fouled the works; the bits of debris needed to be cleaned off and new grease applied, which involved replacing the ring’s bearings as well. The left-hand ring did not show nearly as much damage, but was greased as a preventive measure.During the first spacewalk, Captain Stefanyshyn-Piper lost a bag of tools that had not been tethered — they floated away from the station. She later called the loss of the $100,000 tool bag “very disheartening,” and said, “We’re going to double- and triple-check everything from here on out.”As of Tuesday, amateur satellite trackers were monitoring the tool bag’s orbit and even posted a video. The bag was traveling more than 1,000 feet ahead of the station, and will eventually fall into the atmosphere and burn up during entry.Astronauts shared supplies and changed their procedures slightly to make the remaining equipment stretch to cover all the tasks. It was slow and difficult work.If all of the surfaces of the rails, known as race rings, that they cleaned and greased were laid flat, the astronauts would have serviced more than 471 feet of metal — the equivalent length of more than one and a half football fields. When Captain Bowen completed the task on the right-side joint during the fourth spacewalk, applause from mission control played over the communications channel.Tuesday morning, mission controllers started the right-hand joint and it performed smoothly, though analysis of the repair will continue for weeks.Michael T. Suffredini, the head of the space station program, told reporters in a briefing on Tuesday afternoon that the early results are so promising that NASA might be able to avoid replacing the damaged race and simply continue to lubricate the joint every year or so. ""So this is a very positive step for us,"" he said.Much smirking and laughter accompanied the launching of the water recycling system, part of a $250 million environmental system that will eventually recycle water used throughout the station. But the initial failures of the system were a serious matter: the unit is a critical piece of hardware that will be essential to operating the station when the crew size is doubled from three to six next year.If the system could not be made to work, the increase in crew size may have had to wait, and the nations that have spent billions to become full participants in the orbiting laboratory could have found their plans pushed back.The crew assembled the water purification system well ahead of schedule, but began encountering trouble soon after it was turned on. The distillation unit within the water purification system repeatedly shut itself down about two hours after being started up — about half the time of its expected run.A centrifuge in the part of the system that distills the water would begin to slow down, possibly because heat or vibration caused it to come into contact with a speed sensor. A team of engineers on the ground tried to determine the cause of the problem; on Sunday, astronauts took out the rubber plugs used to dampen vibrations and reduce noise. The centrifuge ran an hour longer than it had before the change, but it eventually shut down again.On Monday, astronauts secured the unit even more tightly to its rack with extra bolts, and that appears to have done the trick — though at times, Colonel Fincke said, the centrifuge sounded “like a washer in the spin cycle.”To gain time to work on the system, mission managers extended the visit by the shuttle Endeavour and its crew by a day, in case the water unit had to be disassembled and parts brought back to Earth.Jeffrey A. Hoffman, a former astronaut and a professor of the practice of aerospace engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said in an interview that when machinery rotates at very high speed, as the distillation unit’s centrifuge does, “any slight irregularity can lead to major mechanical problems,” and the shift from Earth’s gravity to the station’s microgravity environment can substantially alter how such machinery behaves.The high point of the mission so far might be a free moment grabbed by Mr. Pettit, whose “Saturday Morning Science” features when he lived aboard the station in 2002 and 2003 served as an example of how engaging and fun science education from space can be.On Sunday, Mr. Pettit showed off an invention that allowed him to drink coffee from a cup instead of using a pouch. Using a folded piece of plastic from a notebook, he demonstrated principles of fuel tanks in zero gravity, using surface tension along the folded edge of the makeshift cup to wick the fluid up to his mouth.“This may very well be what future space colonists end up using when they want to have a celebration and do a toast,” he said, “without having to suck ’em from a bag.” He finished the drink, and said, “Ahh — good to the last drop.”'"
"'08-11-26,'1','Michael Vick opened the door to a possible early release from federal prison Tuesday by pleading guilty in Virginia to a state charge of dogfighting, a necessary step in his quest to return to the N.F.L.Vick, the former Atlanta Falcons quarterback now serving a 23-month federal term in Leavenworth, Kan., pleaded guilty in Surry County Circuit Court to one count of dogfighting and not guilty to one count of cruelty to animals, which the state then dropped. Circuit Court Judge Samuel Campbell handed down a three-year suspended sentence.The pleas cleared the only outstanding charges against Vick, a move that could lead to an early release from prison to a halfway house. Federal law prohibits prisoners from being released to a halfway house if they have charges pending. Vick, 28, was sentenced in August 2007 and is scheduled for release on July 20, 2009. He will serve three years of probation.Vick is expected to apply to Commissioner Roger Goodell for reinstatement to N.F.L. The league suspended him indefinitely in August 2007 when he pleaded guilty to federal charges stemming from a dogfighting ring run from property he owned in rural Virginia.League officials did not immediately respond to requests for comment.“I want to apologize to the court, my family, and to all the kids who looked up to me as a role model,” Vick told Campbell during Tuesday’s hearing. Campbell had ordered Vick to appear in court in person because of the intense public interest in the case. He arrived shackled, but the restraints were removed before the hearing.Vick’s mother, Brenda Boddie, his brother Marcus Vick and fiancée, Kijafa Frink, attended the hearing. They had no comment as they left the courtroom. Surry County Commonwealth Attorney Gerald Poindexter hugged Boddie before she left.'"
"'08-11-26,'1','SYDNEY, Australia — Australian lawmakers have approved legislation giving homosexual couples the same rights as heterosexuals but have ruled out legalizing same-sex marriages.The Senate passed amendments late Monday to around 100 family, health and taxation laws that give homosexual couples access to the same services as opposite-sex couples living together in “de facto,” or common-law, relationships.Among the major changes, the reforms allow homosexuals family benefits under the state-run health care program, and to leave their retirement benefits to their partners if they die. They also confer parental rights on gay and lesbian couples with children.The legislation now goes to House of Representatives where it is expected to pass.While the laws give same-sex partners many of the same rights and protections as married couples, they stop short of allowing gays and lesbians to wed under the Marriage Act, which was redrawn by the last Conservative government to define marriage as between one man and one woman.When the ruling Labor Party won election in 2007, it did so in part on a promise to end discrimination against gays and lesbians. But party leaders have said that pledge does not include same-sex marriages.“It won’t be part of this government’s agenda,” Attorney-General Robert McClelland said Tuesday. “The Labor Party policy is firm that marriage is between a man and a woman.”'"

"'08-11-27,'0','The general thesis of the column was that a near-total breakdown of responsibility at every link in our financial chain got us here. Mr. Friedman also stated that we either bail out the people who brought us here or risk a total systemic crash.Recently, I lost my job in health care because of a reduction in work force. I found a job at less than half my previous salary. I am in a systemic crash at my house. Who will bail out people like me who have been responsible and hardworking?I have no debts other than a mortgage on devalued property and student loans for my daughter’s college education. Yet there are millions like me who do not have lobbyists or political action committees to bail us out or represent our interests.Thomas L. Friedman’s comments were scathing. Many became wealthy, indeed, fabulously wealthy, on the ignorance of borrowers and the opportunity of lax regulations. The risk was bundled and sold on down the line.But the damning fact remains: The equity of the wealthy who profited from this consensus greed is going nowhere, while this winter promises to be colder and darker for the rest of us as we open our pocketbooks to pay for it all.'"
"'08-11-27,'0','Fortunately, given recent events, a growing number of studies over the past decade have suggested that money does not equal happiness, among them one concluding that the Inuit of northern Greenland and the Masai in Kenya were just as happy as members of the Forbes 400 list of richest Americans.The latest word on happiness from the frontlines of medicine and science was condensed, à la SparkNotes, into user-friendly 15-minute nuggets.Dr. David Spiegel, a professor at the Stanford School of Medicine and the director of its Center on Stress and Health, discussed the positive effects of group therapy on metastatic breast cancer patients, and his belief that people can live longer if they face their illnesses directly with proper emotional support. “I’ve never lost a patient to terminal crying,” Dr. Spiegel said. “Suppressing sadness is the devil’s bargain.”Professor Sapolsky of Stanford made a similar point about humans and baboons. Modern stress disorders contributing to hypertension, heart disease and other illnesses are the result of a disjuncture between primitive conditions and our own — or, as he put it, “running for your life in the savannah versus 30-year mortgages.”The relatively new field of behavioral neurogenetics is exploring a handful of genes that seem to be related to depression, anxiety, addictive personality, sensation seeking and other traits. But, Professor Sapolsky said in a follow-up e-mail message, a person’s risk seems not predetermined but rather the result of interactions of genes and the environment, especially stressors in childhood.Social support is vital, no matter how healthy you are, he told the crowd. “How much you groom somebody else is more important than who grooms you.”The audience, composed largely of the helping professions, also included a senior vice president of a large mortgage company, who would not give her name. She said she had laid off more than 500 people in the last six months, and was there to learn how to boost the morale of employees working weekends and holidays and making do with bonuses cut in half. “What truly makes people happy is a higher calling,” she said, adding that companies like hers were not totally at fault for the mortgage crisis. “Western society is too focused on blame,” she said. “In order for our customers to be happy, they have to understand that they’re accountable.”“Happiness entrepreneurs” promoted themselves in the tea break that ended with the ting of a Tibetan prayer bell. Aymee Coget, who wants to be the Suze Orman of happiness, handed out fliers for her “Happiness Makeover,” a three-month route to “sustainable eudaemonia.” Ms. Coget, dressed to the nines in pink silk, said, “I guarantee happiness in three months.”In the Bay Area, the happiness business has been in full flower. James Baraz, a revered meditation teacher, has a 10-month course in Berkeley on “Awakening Joy.” Among the exercises and meditations are suggestions for improving your life, including singing every day, making lists of things that made you happy and getting a “joy buddy.”The course is a bona fide phenomenon since an article appeared in O, Oprah Winfrey’s magazine, with 300 people taking it in Berkeley and 2,500 taking it online.“Neuroscience and spirituality are coming together,” Mr. Baraz said by telephone. “It’s not airy-fairy stuff.”Nevertheless, a few renegades at the conference suggested that happiness was overrated. “Unhappiness about not being happy is a modern condition,” said Darrin M. McMahon, a professor of history at Florida State University. “We cannot feel good all the time, nor should we.”Yet the national embrace of “Yes We Can” hung in the air. “We’ve had a period of borrowing money, personal gratification, consumption and self-interest,” said Dacher Keltner, a professor of psychology at the University of California, Berkeley, and a director of the Greater Good Science Center. “Now we will have a president who is talking about sacrifice.”“Human beings are wired to care and give,” Dr. Keltner added, “and it’s probably our best route to happiness.”'"
"'08-11-27,'0','Not only was Mr. Obama a senator for four years and Vice President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. of Delaware in Congress for 36 years, but Rahm Emanuel, the incoming White House chief of staff, was most recently a member of the House leadership.In addition, the former Democratic Senate leader Tom Daschle, a mentor of Mr. Obama, is expected to be the secretary of health and human services, applying his intimate knowledge of the workings of Congress as the administration tackles national health care.Philip Schiliro, a longtime Congressional aide with deep knowledge of the membership, will be the administration’s point man on Capitol Hill, continuing a role that he took on for the Obama campaign in July.Peter R. Orszag, the director of the Congressional Budget Office, was recently named Mr. Obama’s budget director, and on Wednesday Rob Nabors, staff director of the House Appropriations Committee, was chosen to be Mr. Orszag’s deputy. Capitol Hill staff members are filling less prominent positions as well.Still, such close relationships do not mean that tension between Congress and the White House will not break out. Democratic leaders are already somewhat divided on how much should be spent on an initiative to spur the economy, and there is certain to be some disagreement on whether new spending and tax cuts should be paid for rather than added to the deficit.Jason Furman, a top economic adviser to Mr. Obama, met at the Capitol last week with members of the fiscally conservative Blue Dog coalition. Mr. Furman used the gathering to initiate talks about budget rules, including a potential law requiring balanced budgets to formalize the pay-as-you-go approach favored by the coalition.“The Obama folks have made contact with myself and other Blue Dogs, and basically have said that look, the economy is Priority No. 1, but fiscal responsibility is a part of what they believe in, too,” said Representative Baron P. Hill, Democrat of Indiana, who attended the meeting.But as it seeks to speed its agenda, the new administration will be trying to steer Congressional leaders and chairmen who may be reluctant to surrender too much of the power they regained from Republicans in 2006.“Many members of Congress have been there many years, and there are some people who just two years ago got back the gavel, who now have to cede some of their authority to the incoming administration,” said Howard Paster, who was President Bill Clinton’s first director of legislative affairs. “They are going to be supportive, but they are also not going to cede all of their authority. Human nature doesn’t allow for that.”But Mr. Paster and others credit the new administration with a quick start in its dealings with Congress and say that should pay early dividends. Mr. Paster noted that Mr. Schiliro’s appointment as the chief liaison to Congress was announced within a week of the election, while his own appointment to that job did not occur until January 1993.Democratic Congressional aides say they have been in regular touch with the Obama transition team about a potential aid package for automakers, which would be voted on in December. Congressional leaders, working with the incoming administration, also plan to assemble a major economic package that could combine tax cuts, public works projects and energy programs.The Democrats would also like to win quick enactment of an expansion of a children’s health insurance program that President Bush blocked twice with vetoes.In addition, Mr. Hoyer, the majority leader, said Congress would like to finish up spending bills that stalled last year and have them ready for the president so he could focus on the next year’s budget. For that, Democrats are counting on some Republicans to join them, motivated by what is expected to be a bleak holiday shopping season and continuing economic gloom.Republican leaders, however, while pledging cooperation with the new administration, have expressed skepticism about the Democrats’ economic proposals.'"
"'08-11-27,'0','“It’s a tremendous break with the past in terms of what low-income people are expected to pay for their health care,” said Sara Rosenbaum, a professor of health law and policy at George Washington University.Higher co-payments may be an attractive option for states struggling to rein in Medicaid costs in the current fiscal crisis, which has reduced state revenues even as the need for assistance grows. Rather than restricting eligibility, states can charge more.“This flexibility will help protect the program from cutbacks in a time of tight state budgets,” the administration said in a preamble to the final rule.The administration acknowledged that “some individuals may choose to delay or forgo care rather than pay their cost-sharing obligations.”Public health experts said such delays could cause serious health problems, requiring more expensive care at a later date. Many Medicaid recipients have chronic illnesses, use numerous prescription drugs and frequently visit doctors, so the burden of even modest co-payments can become substantial.But Jeff Nelligan, a spokesman for the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, said Wednesday: “States are in the best position to determine the appropriate levels of cost sharing. This rule gives states more tools to help slow spending growth, while maintaining needed coverage, which was the intent of Congress.”When the rule was proposed this year, it drew criticism from the American Academy of Pediatrics, the National Association for Home Care and AARP, among other groups. They said that higher co-payments would make it more difficult for low-income children, homebound people and older Americans to get care.David P. Sloane, senior vice president of AARP, said, “Denying necessary care to people who are unable to pay is unconscionable,” as well as fiscally unwise.A coalition of groups serving people with AIDS said, “It is well documented that even nominal levels of cost sharing result in people going without medically necessary care.”Under the rule, the administration estimated, Medicaid recipients will pay more than $1.3 billion in co-payments over five years, and the federal government will save $1.4 billion, while states will save $1.1 billion. The savings would result not only from the collection of co-payments, but also from reduced use of services.The co-payments will help Medicaid recipients become “more educated and efficient health care consumers,” the administration said.The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that 13 million low-income people, about a fifth of Medicaid recipients, will face new or higher co-payments. Most of the savings result from “decreased use of services,” it said.The rule allows states to establish a sliding scale for premiums and co-payments. The total of these charges, for all members of a family, cannot exceed 5 percent of the family’s income.For Medicaid recipients with incomes at or below the poverty level ($17,600 for a family of three), a state can charge co-payments up to $3.40 for a doctor’s visit or other service. The maximum amount will be updated each year to reflect medical inflation.For Medicaid recipients with incomes from 100 percent to 150 percent of the poverty level ($17,600 to $26,400 for a family of three), states can generally require a beneficiary to pay up to 10 percent of what the state pays for a service, like a doctor’s visit.And for Medicaid recipients with incomes above that level, states can generally charge co-payments up to 20 percent of what they pay. For a $150 drug, the co-payment could be as much as $30.Under the rule, states can use co-payments to promote the use of preferred brand-name drugs and to discourage the use of hospital emergency rooms for routine care.'"
"'08-11-27,'0','MOSCOW — With winter approaching, Gazprom, the Russian state-controlled natural gas monopoly, and Ukraine are again locked in a dispute over the price of natural gas.Gazprom said Wednesday that if Ukraine did not pay a $2.4 billion debt by Jan. 1, it might more than double the price of natural gas, which would deal a blow to Ukraine’s economy.The company said it would try to avoid cutting off gas to Ukraine, which it did briefly in 2006, disrupting supplies in Europe.Ukraine now pays $179.50 for 1,000 cubic meters of gas, far below the market price of over $400, Gazprom said.Oleg Dubina, the chief executive of the Ukraine state energy company, said it was struggling to find the money to make payment.The $2.4 billion that Gazprom has demanded includes penalties for late payment.'"
"'08-11-27,'0','After rising above $145 a barrel this summer, oil prices have fallen below $55 a barrel, their lowest level in more than three years. Instead of coasting on growing demand, producers are confronted with a significantly different environment, and must adapt to a world of slowing consumption and overflowing oil supplies. They must also contend with hundreds of billions of dollars in lost revenue.In the last two months, OPEC agreed to cut its output by two million barrels a day. While analysts say members of the cartel are generally abiding by their pledge, the effect on the market has failed to materialize so far.Since the group’s last meeting a month ago, OPEC’s reference basket price — an average of oil grades sold by producers of the cartel, including Saudi Arab Light and Sahara Blend from Algeria — has fallen by more than half, reaching a low of $42 a barrel last week.The cartel’s traditional hawks have been pushing for a more aggressive cut in production this week, and there is talk of trying to rally non-OPEC producers to help stabilize the market. The oil minister of Venezuela, Rafael Ramirez, suggested the cartel should reduce its production by an additional one million barrels a day, a position that was endorsed by Iran.But a decision is far from certain and some producers are dragging their feet. OPEC’s president, Chakib Khelil, said the group needed to see how well producers were complying with their prior commitments to pare supplies before agreeing to a new cut. The group is scheduled to meet again in Algeria next month.“There are disagreements between producers,” said Greg Priddy, an oil analyst at Eurasia, a political consulting group in Washington. “Some members are below their pain threshold, especially Iran. But the Saudis will not allow themselves to be strong-armed. They want to see how everyone is complying before agreeing to another round of cuts.”Guy F. Caruso, the former administrator of the Energy Information Administration, said the Saudis have been cautious so far, trying to balance their budget requirements with concerns about the global economy. Even if OPEC agreed to a new cut in production, analysts doubt that all the countries would abide by their quotas, and it would fall to Saudi Arabia to shoulder the brunt of the cutbacks.“The Saudis have the longer-term view,” Mr. Caruso said. “They don’t want to be in the situation they were in the 1980s when almost all the burden fell on them to defend the price.”The drop in prices is threatening the economic and political foundations of many oil producers. Iran’s populist president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, is expected to run for re-election next year while Hugo Chávez of Venezuela is being contested in local elections at home. Both countries need oil above $90 a barrel to balance their budgets, according to various estimates.“The Iranians, the Russians and the Venezuelans, who had benefited the most from the rise in price, are the ones paying dearly now with the collapse,” said Lawrence Goldstein, a veteran energy analyst.But while different producers have competing agendas, the drop in prices has been so rapid that even moderates are feeling the sting.“Prices have gotten to a point that they are hurting everybody now,” Mr. Goldstein said. “A world of $50 oil or less is in no one’s interest within the organization.”This weekend’s meeting may include proposals to open consultations with producers outside of the cartel, the Iranian envoy has indicated, and could set the contours for a coordinated response between OPEC and non-OPEC producers like Mexico and Russia. In the late 1990s, Norway and Mexico trimmed their production to bolster oil prices after the Asian economic crisis.The Russian energy minister, Sergei Shmatko, on Tuesday suggested that his country might reduce its output in tandem with OPEC. He said that Russia required $95 a barrel next year, otherwise its budget would be strained and its currency would suffer.But with its production already declining this year because of a lack of investments, it is unlikely that Russia will follow through, analysts said.Over the last decade, OPEC has stepped in three times with large production cuts to stop prices from falling — in 2001, 2003 and 2006. Only once, however, did producers fully comply with their pledges to trim their output, according to analysts at Barclays Capital.When prices last fell toward $50 a barrel, at the end of 2006, members of the cartel agreed to cuts totaling 1.7 million barrels a day but they cut only 900,000 barrels a day, according to Barclays.Yet prices rebounded because oil production from non-OPEC producers, like Mexico and Norway, was disappointing and consumption kept rising.Now, even if OPEC agrees to reduce its output further, it is doubtful that oil will rebound soon. In the past, it has typically taken three to six months for oil prices to rise after OPEC trims supplies, according to Deutsche Bank.“In terms of crude oil, we believe downward pressure on prices is likely to persist throughout next year,” according to a report by Deutsche Bank. “OPEC will struggle to cut production as fast as world growth is slowing over the next 12 months.”'"
"'08-11-27,'0','About all he has not done since winning the Westminster at Madison Square Garden and retiring from competition is to sire any puppies.“We’ve put that on the back burner until it feels right,” said his owner, Caroline Dowell, with whom he lives in Austin, Tex. — when he gets there.Now, the world-famous dog show ace is preparing for another first for a Westminster winner: on Thursday, he will be aboard the “Peanuts” float, a rendition of Snoopy’s doghouse, at the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade.Uno will be joined on the float by David Frei, the Westminster club’s director of communications and analyst on the show’s USA telecasts. Frei plays two other roles: Uno’s squire to nearly all his appearances, locally and nationally, and wrangler/maître d’ at his Manhattan apartment.“I’m his foster father,” Frei said Tuesday night, in the one-bedroom apartment that he shares with his wife, Cherilyn, two Brittanys, Teigh and Belle, and a Cavalier King Charles Spaniel, Angel. Uno’s red crate sits in the living room, between the TV and a large communal dog pillow.“Come on, bubba, get into your crate,” Frei said, using his pet name for Uno. “Come on, come on.” Uno fled to an ottoman instead.“He will sleep until noon if he has his druthers,” Frei said.For the parade, Uno will be awakened at 6:15 a.m. He will drink water but eat nothing except for treats on the float until lunch. Frei will walk his rambunctious quartet through his neighborhood, where Uno has become a regular at outdoor cafes. Soon after, Uno and Frei will ride in a car sent by Macy’s to the parade staging area at 77th Street and Central Park West.Uno’s high-energy trot to the White House and Herald Square began with five words from Dr. J. Donald Jones, Westminster’s best-in-show judge:The appeal of Uno — official name: Ch. K-Run’s Park Me in First — emanates, in part, from the perennial popularity of beagles: the breed currently ranks fifth in American Kennel Club registrations. It is an everyday pet, a Joe the Dog, whom people can easily relate to. And no beagle had won anything at Westminster beyond the hound group, in 1939.As the floppy-eared embodiment of popular culture icons like Snoopy and Underdog, Uno seems to possess charm, if not charisma, and patience with people who want to pet him, nuzzle him or take photos of him.One man outside Busch Stadium erased the cellphone pictures of his children to make room for shots of Uno with his wife.If winning — and winning big — conditions a dog to assume that all applause is for him, Uno has that reflex. Hours after fetching the first toss by Fredbird, the Cardinals’ mascot, he was dozing in a luxury box, his muzzle on Frei’s right thigh. But when he heard the standing ovation for the Cardinals when they loaded the bases, he leaped to his feet, fully alert.“He thinks the applause is for him,” said Kathy Weichert, his co-breeder. Uno and his three siblings were born in the garage at her house in Belleville, Ill., the progeny of Parker and Secret.Uno lives on Dowell’s property, across a road from her ranch. He plays mostly with Gracie, a champion beagle in her own right, and spends much of his time in a large building with 20 indoor and outdoor dog runs. Dowell has 40 or 50 beagles, mostly from shelters, some of them “death row dogs.”“When Uno gets home from his trips, he’s just tired, and he usually crawls up on his futon and taps out for two or three days,” Dowell said. He is usually in a small bevy of beagles, not with the larger group of rescue dogs.“He’d like to play more with them, but I don’t want him nipped or scratched,” she said. “So I protect him like the celebrity he is.”As part of the deal to finance Uno’s training costs, Dowell became Uno’s sole owner upon his retirement. But his adieu to the ring came sooner than expected, before he turned 3. “I was told best-in-show winners don’t continue to show, but I said, ‘Why not? He enjoys it,’ ” she said. “But I was told that there are judges who are gunslingers, and you don’t want one of them in some small show to say he dumped the Westminster winner.”When Uno flies, which is often, it is exclusively with Midwest Airlines. Its celebrity pet program lets him sit in coach, in a harness that connects to the seat belt and keeps him safe. He gets a ticket and a boarding pass in the name of Uno Frei. Once he got flagged for additional screening.“He got wanded and they patted him down,” David Frei said.Susan Kerwin, the marketing specialist who created the celebrity dog program for Midwest, has flown with Uno, had him to her house for overnights with her English setters and danced with him on a dugout after his first fetch at Miller Park. On flights, she said, “He draws crowds around him like Ashton Kutcher,” and dines on carob chip cookies.Uno’s retirement has given him time to become a certified therapy dog — he has done work at Ronald McDonald Houses — although he is not yet at the stage where he will snuggle next to a sick child for long periods.“He’s young, so it’s still all about Uno,” Frei said.He has also become a celebrity invited to events to be himself. Last Saturday in Reading, Pa., he was in the Purina booth during the National Dog Show (which the pet food company sponsors). “People just flocked to him like a rock star,” said Ann Viklund, a Purina spokeswoman.Earlier this week, in a Manhattan TV studio, he helped publicize the National Dog Show — which will be carried Thursday on tape by NBC — with its voices, Frei and John O’Hurley, during a round of satellite interviews. Uno sat at Frei’s feet, never baying. With little but a Purina connection to the show he was promoting, Uno’s link to Westminster was cited in each interview.Uno’s impact on Westminster may not endure. His successors might not be able to replicate the months worth of exposure he has provided the club if they are not as portable, popular, adorable or desired.He could be the champion emeritus. “I’ve had calls from people who want Uno in March,” Frei said. “I said, ‘There’ll be a new winner in February,’ but they say, ‘No, we want Uno.’ He might be re-elected.”'"
"'08-11-27,'0','“Instead of having eyes bigger than your stomach, you should look at this range rather than this range,” he said. “So you gently lead them to suggestions that may fit and cost them less money.” He said fees could range from $5,000 to $50,000.Mr. Barclay added, though, that the biggest names, like his client David Sedaris, were “recession proof.” He said Mr. Sedaris, whose latest book, “When You Are Engulfed in Flames,” was published in June, just completed a 34-city tour in 34 days, selling 65,000 tickets. “We’re planning his fall 2009 tour, and I have way more offers than I know what to do with,” Mr. Barclay said.Still, several agencies say that bookings for the coming year are down, as some former customers have canceled meetings or curtailed the use of outside speakers. Mr. Walker said bookings had declined slightly from last year. Bernie Swain, chairman of Washington Speakers Bureau, which exclusively represents 187 clients, including Colin L. Powell, Alan Greenspan and Madeleine Albright, said bookings from financial institutions had dropped in the past two months to about 20 percent below the same period last year.“The traditional buyers that have been in the marketplace for the last 8 to 10 years have cut back,” said Don Epstein, chief executive of Greater Talent Network, which represents Campbell Brown, Tom Wolfe and P. J. O’Rourke. “Especially Wall Streeters and the real estate market and the insurance companies. Certain financial institutions aren’t even there, and these were all great customers of ours for a long time.”American International Group, the insurance giant that recently received a government bailout package, announced in a statement last month that it was canceling more than 160 conferences and events after a “candid discussion” with Andrew M. Cuomo, New York’s attorney general, who “laid out his serious concerns regarding executive compensation issues and exorbitant expenses at A.I.G.”An A.I.G. spokesman said he did not know how many of those meetings had scheduled paid speakers, but the company did cancel a planned appearance by Terry Bradshaw, the former quarterback and current television football analyst, at a training event for independent financial advisers that was held this month at a resort in Phoenix.Given the climate some speakers are cutting their fees. Mr. Walker of American Program Bureau said that he had recently booked a “major, major TV icon” who generally earns $75,000 for a speaking appearance at an event at a Fortune 100 technology company for one-third the normal fee.Bruce M. MacMillan, president and chief executive of Meeting Professionals International, an umbrella group of professional meeting planners whose members also include executives from 80 of the Fortune 100 companies, said that two-thirds of its 24,000 members expect a decline in their event-planning business in the coming year.But Mr. MacMillan said that while sports or entertainment figures who generally are brought in for primarily motivational purposes might see a drop-off in speaking engagements, some companies and professional organizations would put even more emphasis on serious speakers in a difficult economy. “People want answers in this type of economy,” he said. “Yes, you can read books or research it on the Internet, but engaging with a live human being is the best way to get answers in this economy right now.”For people who can speak on the hot topics — the economy, the changing political landscape after the election of Barack Obama — bookings remain strong.Carlton Sedgeley, president of Royce Carlton, a speakers agency in New York, said that an author like Fareed Zakaria, the editor of Newsweek International and author of “The Post-American World,” has more than 30 dates lined up for 2009, including appearances at colleges, professional organizations and companies like IBM and Accenture, a technology consulting business.Speakers bureaus affiliated with publishing companies have so far not seen a significant decline in bookings despite a tough environment for book sales. Many of their clients speak at orientations for college freshmen or other campus events, and so far that business is not drying up.“As far as universities go, I think they have to be competitive with each other to attract top students,” said Jacqueline Fischetti, who runs the Penguin Speakers Bureau and represents Penguin authors like Junot Diaz, Michael Pollan and Geraldine Brooks. “I don’t think they can cut these programs.”Paul Bogaards, a spokesman for Alfred A. Knopf, a publisher that also runs its own speakers bureau, said that by representing some authors who were not necessarily household names and who commanded low fees, the company was not yet affected by the downturn.He said bookings for 2009 were up 70 percent compared with the same point last year, albeit based on a relatively small sample.'"
"'08-11-27,'0','On Tuesday his lawyers sent a harshly worded letter to the soft drink maker complaining of its “appalling failure to make good on a promise it made to the American public,” and demanding a public apology, more time for thirsty fans, and payment for piggybacking on the “Chinese Democracy” publicity.When asked about the letter, Dr Pepper said in a statement that the company took “great steps” to accommodate the online requests from consumers.“This was one of the largest responses we have ever received for a giveaway,” the statement said, “and we’re happy we were able to satisfy the thirst of so many Dr Pepper fans.”A spokesman said it was not known how many free sodas were given away on Sunday and Monday.Mr. Rose’s representatives said that they tried to collaborate with Dr Pepper on the best way to distribute the soda, but that negotiations broke down.“We had made an effort to turn this into a win-win-win — for the American public, Dr Pepper and Axl,” said Laurie Soriano, one of Mr. Rose’s lawyers. “But Dr Pepper’s view was just that Dr Pepper would win.”The music industry had largely given up hope that “Chinese Democracy” would ever come out. Still, many assumed that if it ever was released it would likely be a gigantic seller. Guns N’ Roses, one of the most popular American bands of the last 30 years, has sold more than 40 million albums in the United States alone, according to the Recording Industry Association of America.But anecdotal reports suggest that “Chinese Democracy,” which was released through an exclusive deal with the Best Buy chain, might not be the blockbuster the industry had hoped for. Sales figures will not be available until next week, but early estimates put the first-week total at 300,000 to 500,000 copies, a respectable but not extraordinary amount. Last week, for example, Beyoncé sold 482,000 copies of her latest record, “I Am ... Sasha Fierce.”The letter from Mr. Rose’s lawyers asks that Dr Pepper run apologetic full-page ads in The New York Times, The Los Angeles Times and other papers, giving customers more time to receive their free soda.“If they said they’d give a free can to everyone in America,” one fan wrote, “can they really put a one-day time limit on it? Seems like it’s something that if someone took to court they’d win.”1000 2008-11-27 NBC’s midseason schedule is heavy on the few shows that have worked for the network this season — that is, reality shows and “Saturday Night Live” — and light on other scripted programming, The Hollywood Reporter said. On Jan. 4, NBC will introduce “Superstars of Dance,” a competition created by the producers of “American Idol,” and on Jan. 9 it will debut “Howie Do It,” a hidden-camera show hosted by Howie Mandel of “Deal or No Deal.” Two more prime-time “SNL” specials will also be shown that month, and “Friday Night Lights” will begin Jan. 16. Missing from the line-up are the hourlong series “Medium,” “Life,” “Chuck” and “Heroes,” though those shows are expected to return in February.1001 2008-11-27 Good news for fans of alternative country music who have already lost their girlfriends, dogs and pickup trucks: the magazine No Depression, which chronicled the alternative-country scene and gave early boosts to the careers of artists like Wilco and Ryan Adams, has resumed publication, The Associated Press reported. Taking its name from the Carter Family song “No Depression in Heaven” (and the album “No Depression” by the band Uncle Tupelo), the magazine was founded in 1995 and published bimonthly until its May-June 2008 issue. Citing the declining prospects of the magazine and music industries, it moved to a Web-only format. Now, its editors say, No Depression will come out as a twice-yearly “bookazine” with no advertising. “We had a pretty large outpouring of sentiment and support,” said Peter Blackstock, a co-editor of No Depression, according to The Associated Press. He added, “There’s still a community there — we weren’t losing readership.”1002 2008-11-27 “For the last 21 months, food manufacturers, restaurants and livestock producers have been absorbing significant costs that in my view are likely to be passed on to consumers in 2009 and beyond,” said Mr. Lapp, a former chief economist at ConAgra Foods.While predicting future food prices is an inexact science, data released by the Labor Department last week suggested the forecasters might be right.Overall consumer prices recorded the biggest drop in the history of the Consumer Price Index, but food prices continued to inch upward, albeit at a slower pace than in previous months. The C.P.I. showed that grocery prices rose 0.1 percent in October.Some of the more visible items on grocery shelves, including produce and dairy products, dropped sharply in recent weeks, but not enough to offset the general trend of rising prices. Restaurant prices rose 0.5 percent in October.Commodity prices began climbing rapidly in the fall of 2007, and food companies were hit hard by the increases. They tried to slow eroding profit margins by cutting operating costs, making packages smaller and raising prices.Some companies, like Kellogg and Heinz, have managed to offset the higher ingredient costs and post robust profits by using shrewd commodity hedges and by raising prices without losing many customers. They also benefited from a trend of consumers eating out less and buying more groceries.But other food companies have struggled. Hershey, for instance, locked in high cocoa prices this year only to see prices drop this fall, analysts say. And meat and poultry companies have been hit by higher feed costs and a limited ability to charge higher prices, at least in the short term.Now, even though costs for ingredients like corn and wheat have dropped, meat and poultry providers say they still have not raised prices enough to cover their increased costs. And packaged food manufacturers are unlikely to lower prices because commodity costs remain relatively high and they are still trying to rebuild eroded margins.Michael Mitchell, a spokesman for Kraft Foods, said that the company’s food ingredient costs this year were running $2 billion higher than in 2007, a 13 percent increase, but that the company had raised its overall prices by only 7 percent.William P. Roenigk, senior vice president and chief economist for the National Chicken Council, said his industry had been losing money for more than a year. Chicken producers are now trying to recover those costs by reducing production, which will eventually alter the balance between supply and demand. “The time is coming when we’re going to see a very significant increase in the retail price of chicken,” he said.The restaurant industry, which has been battered by a sharp drop in customers, also says it has not been able to raise prices enough to keep pace with the cost of ingredients.People in the restaurant business said they did not like raising prices during an economic downturn. “If anything in this environment, one would be looking at the ability to offer much greater emphasis on value pricing in restaurant menus,” said Hudson Riehle, chief economist of the National Restaurant Association. “In contrast, exactly the opposite is happening. Our operators are being forced to raise menu prices at the highest rate since 1990.”Predictions about food prices are subject to change because commodity prices are unpredictable. Ephraim Leibtag, an economist for the Agriculture Department, said food inflation would slow by the middle of next year if commodity prices remained low. “Right now the forecast is about 4 percent, but that would be lowered if we do not see any surge in commodity costs over the next few months,” he said.A reason that overall food prices are expected to continue increasing is the lag between price increases for basic commodities and for finished food products in the grocery store, particularly for meat and processed foods. Consider the price of corn, an ingredient in things like cereal and breaded shrimp. It was not too long ago that corn hovered around $2 or $3 a bushel.But corn prices began climbing last fall and peaked around $8 a bushel in June. They have since dropped to about $3.50 a bushel, still above the historical norm. Some food manufacturers locked in prices for corn and other commodities in the spring and summer, fearing that prices could go even higher. But prices fell instead, and they are now stuck with the higher prices until their contracts expire.When costs go up for livestock producers, they are often unable to immediately raise prices because those prices are set on the open market, which is dictated by supply and demand. Instead, they begin reducing the size of their herds or flocks, which eventually leads to less meat on the market and higher prices. But reducing livestock production can take months to years, and in the interim it can actually suppress prices as breeding animals are slaughtered to reduce production.The prospect of more food inflation is inflaming a debate over its causes. Many food manufacturers and economists maintain that one culprit is government policies promoting the use of ethanol fuel made from corn.About a third of the corn crop is used for ethanol, putting ethanol producers in competition with livestock farmers and food manufacturers. The result, they contend, is that prices for corn are now higher and more volatile.“The connection of oil prices to agricultural commodities is new as of 2007, and it’s a major game changer for those in the food production business,” said Thomas E. Elam, president of FarmEcon, a consulting firm.But ethanol advocates counter that the food industry’s arguments have been proved false, saying that corn prices have declined as ethanol production is increasing. Matt Hartwig, spokesman for the Renewable Fuels Association, an ethanol industry group, said food companies were “very quick to tell the American public that they had to raise food prices because corn was so expensive, and that the reason corn was so expensive was corn-based ethanol.”Mr. Hartwig added: “Now, clearly, we know that relationship doesn’t exist. If ethanol isn’t the reason, what is the real reason for food prices going up?”1003 2008-11-27 As a result Mr. Olmert amassed about $85,000 in a private account that was handled by the travel agency, the Justice Ministry said.Lawyers representing Mr. Olmert said they found Mr. Mazuz’s announcement “puzzling and even unreasonable.”“The prime minister was amazed to learn of details and charges which were never brought up in any of his interrogations,” they said. “Contrary to the attorney general’s announcement, Olmert was never confronted with any evidence suggesting he was aware of the alleged acts.”Mr. Olmert formally resigned as prime minister in September under the weight of the investigations. But his replacement as the leader of the Kadima Party, Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni, was unable to form a new government coalition, leaving Mr. Olmert in place as a caretaker prime minister pending elections scheduled for Feb. 10.Although he is already effectively a lame duck, Wednesday’s announcement was likely to chip away at Mr. Olmert’s legitimacy even more.The main cause of Mr. Olmert’s downfall was another case involving money — much of it cash stuffed into envelopes — he is suspected of having received over more than a decade from Morris Talansky, a Long Island businessman. Mr. Talansky’s testimony in a Jerusalem court in May was devastating for Mr. Olmert, who was already unpopular in Israel.It was in the course of the Talansky inquiry that investigators came across evidence of the suspected double-billing.In September, the Israeli police recommended indicting Mr. Olmert in both cases, on charges including bribe-taking, fraud and breach of trust, but the attorney general has the final say.Mr. Talansky’s American lawyer, Bradley Simon, has advised his client not to come back to Israel to testify again, lest he incriminate himself in the United States, where he is under investigation.Mr. Talansky has denied that there was ever any quid pro quo between himself and Mr. Olmert, or that he was involved in bribery.The Israeli Justice Ministry said Wednesday that the attorney general had not yet made a decision regarding the Talansky allegations.1004 2008-11-27 “I think the I.O.C.’s fact sheet is missing a lot of salient facts,” said Minky Worden, media director for Human Rights Watch. “What is missing in this document is the extent to which the International Olympic Committee lowered its standards on human rights around the Beijing Olympic Games.”Thousands of people were evicted from their homes to make way for construction of Olympic venues, and some activists were detained before the Games began. Although authorities set up “protest zones” during the Olympics, no demonstrations took place, and several people who applied for protest permits were detained, including two elderly women who were initially sentenced to up to a year of “re-education through labor.” The sentence was later rescinded.Despite promises by the Chinese that foreign journalists would have unfettered access to the Internet, authorities initially blocked access to several Web sites at the main press center. Although some of the restrictions were loosened, it led the I.O.C. member overseeing press operations, Kevan Gosper, to accuse the Olympic committee of betrayal. In addition, the Foreign Correspondents Club of China logged more than 60 incidents of “reporting interference” during the Olympic period, including several cases where foreign journalists were physically harassed.“I think in the end, the government’s approach to the media hasn’t changed that much,” said Bob Dietz, Asia program coordinator for the Committee to Protect Journalists. Dietz said he and other members of his group traveled to the Olympic committee’s Swiss headquarters in 2006 and met with officials, then again in Beijing in 2007 to express their concerns about press freedom in China. He called the I.O.C. response “tone deaf.”“They just didn’t get it,” he said. “They didn’t understand the importance of our concern.”Sam Zarifi, the Asia Pacific director for Amnesty International, said while the Chinese government has made some strides in recent years, it has hardened its stance on other issues, such as Tibetan autonomy. “China has moved forward, but not at the pace that we had hoped,” Zarifi said. “Certainly for the I.O.C. to pat itself on the back I think is not really a fair evaluation of all that they accomplished.”The I.O.C. report also applauded the Games for improving public health in China, saying that authorities “took new steps to improve food and water safety” and quoted a World Health Official, Hans Troedsson, as saying the public-health legacy of the Games is a “long-term gift to China.”There was no mention of the tainted-milk scandal that broke just after the conclusion of the Games and which has led to the death of four infants and sickened more than 50,000 others. Worden pointed to reports that a Chinese journalist’s blog post about the contaminated milk was removed from a Web site just as the Games were beginning. Chinese reporters were also prohibited from reporting on food-safety issues during the Olympics, she said.“I think it has to be said that the news was there of the toxic baby formula,” Worden said. “Censorship in China is a matter of life and death.”Despite the timing of the tainted-milk scandal, the public health improvements brought about by the Games should not be overlooked, said Zhen Xiaozhen, who served as the medical service manager of the Beijing Olympics. She pointed to a ban on smoking in public places and the training of 3,000 medical volunteers. “These health care volunteers are the legacy for the future,” she said.The meetings in London are part of a debriefing process in which Beijing organizers pass along technical advice to those planning the London Games in 2012. This “knowledge management” process dates to 2000, and was instituted by the I.O.C. president, Jacques Rogge, to improve efficiency and planning of future Olympic Games, said Emmanuelle Moreau, a spokeswoman for the Olympic committee.“The Beijing debrief focuses on the operational aspects of the Games and does not intend to address issues that fall outside the remit of the I.O.C.,” she said in an e-mail message. Moreau said the questions raised by the human-rights groups will be examined next year at the annual Olympic Congress in Copenhagen.Dick Pound, a member of the International Olympic Committee from Montreal, said the Beijing Olympics rightly deserve praise. “I think most of what they identified is good and did in fact happen,” he said. Still, he said post-mortems typically include negative assessments, as well. “You basically learn from the things that didn’t go as well as you might have hoped,” he said.In a speech in London Monday, Rogge praised the Beijing organizers and cautioned against comparing the two Games. When he is asked how London can outshine Beijing, Rogge said, he answers, “it doesn’t need to — London just has to be London. And asking me which Olympic Games is the best is like asking me which of my children I love the best.”Many activists are already focusing on the 2014 Winter Games in Sochi, Russia, which they say may raise many of the same issues as in Beijing. Worden noted that journalists and dissidents are frequently detained and killed in Russia, including two journalists this year who died under suspicious circumstances.Human Rights Watch has called on the International Olympic Committee to set up an internal mechanism that would audit a host city’s human-rights record in the runup to the Games. Although Human Rights Watch has lobbied several national Olympic committees to endorse the idea — including the United States Olympic Committee — so far only the German Olympic Committee has formally expressed interest.Rogge and other I.O.C. members have often resisted efforts to associate the Olympic movement too closely with human-rights issues, arguing that the Games should serve as a refuge from international conflicts and politics. “I would be very cautious about doing that,” Pound said of the Human Rights Watch proposal. “To start legislating how host countries or potential host countries are managing their internal affairs is a lot more complicated and more subtle than saying, oh yes, we insist on human rights.”Moreau, the I.O.C. spokeswoman, said the executive committee has not taken a position on the human rights proposal, but the topic is likely to be discussed at the annual congress next year.1005 2008-11-27 In a brief statement, Bell Canada said that the accounting firm KPMG found in a preliminary analysis that “the amount of the indebtedness” involved in financing the deal, about $30 billion, left it unable to conclude whether the privatized company would be solvent.The exact nature of the solvency problem is not clear. Bell did not release the results of the solvency test nor did it respond to requests for comment. Julie Bannerjea, a spokeswoman for KPMG in Canada, declined to comment, citing client confidentiality.Bell Canada’s chief financial officer, Siim A. Vanaselja, said in that company’s statement, “The company disagrees that the addition of the LBO debt would result in BCE not meeting the technical solvency definition.”The statement said that Bell was reviewing KPMG’s “numerous assumptions and methodologies.”The buyers, which also include Providence Equity Partners, Madison Dearborn Partners and Merrill Lynch, said in a statement that the accountants must confirm the company’s post-takeover solvency for the deal to close.BCE Acquisition Inc., the company organized by the buyers, “has been working closely with BCE to take the actions required by the definitive agreement in connection with the transaction and will continue to fulfill its obligations under the terms of the agreement,” the buyers said in their statement. Ontario Teachers’ declined to comment further.There was little expectation that Bell Canada could salvage the current deal by persuading KPMG to reverse its opinion.“The chance of a deal closing now by December 11th is very low,” Greg MacDonald, an analyst with National Bank Financial, wrote in an investment note.If the deal succeeds, the banks providing its financing will be unlikely to find a receptive market when they go to resell the loans. Two lenders, Citigroup and the Royal Bank of Scotland, both recently received government bailouts. Toronto-Dominion, which is also a minority member of the buyers’ group, and Deutsche Bank have both escaped the worst of the market turmoil to date, but the Bell debt may not be something either wishes to acquire in the current climate.Elliot Soifer, an analyst with Desjardins Securities International, said that the bailout of Citigroup had earlier buoyed hopes that the Bell Canada deal would close.“The market breathed a collective sigh of relief,” he said.But now, he added, it “would be difficult to anticipate” that the buyers and Bell could come up with a new agreement that would both resolve the solvency issue and meet with bank approval.The takeover also appeared to be in danger last spring, after lenders demanded changes in the terms of the financing. That was ultimately resolved when the price of the deal was effectively reduced by about $1.5 billion.Those talks, however, pushed the deal’s closing date to next month from June 30.The buyers have been acting as if they anticipated closing the deal next month.At a meeting with investors last week, Madison Dearborn Partners said that it expected a closing and praised the company’s recent performance. Both Providence and Madison Dearborn have also begun “capital calls” to investors to finance the purchase.The solvency test is the latest in a series of problems plaguing the deal that relate to the company’s current debt. Bell had asked for the measure to be included in an effort to placate its current debt holders.The debt holders, however, challenged the transaction in court, saying it unfairly favored equity holders at their expense. While they were successful at a Quebec court, that ruling was overturned by the Supreme Court of Canada after an unusually swift hearing in June.1006 2008-11-27 Some Wall Street traders worry that the market could falter again as the economic slump deepens. Nevertheless, good news of any sort is welcome on Wall Street these days, and there were a few encouraging signs that maybe, this time, the strength would stick.The optimistic mood survived an early challenge from a series of bleak economic reports, including the biggest monthly downturn in consumer spending since the terrorist attacks of 2001. Jobless claims stayed high, near the levels traditionally associated with a recession, and durable goods orders plunged. Sales of new homes were weak as well.The Dow Jones industrial average gained 247.14 points, or 2.91 percent, to 8,726.61. The broader Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index rose 30.29 points, or 3.53 percent, to 887.68. The Nasdaq composite index climbed 67.37 points, or 4.6 percent, to 1,532.10, on strength in shares of technology companies.Shares of General Motors gained 35 percent, or $1.25, to $4.81, on speculation that the automaker might receive a rescue package from the government.The markets will be closed on Thursday for Thanksgiving Day, and will reopen for a shortened session on Friday.Oil prices rose $3.67, to settle at $54.44 a barrel in New York trading.The energy sector was the leading gainer among industry groups, following the surge in crude oil prices. Analysts said a move by the Chinese government to cut interest rates could stimulate the country’s economy and revive demand for energy.OPEC ministers are set to meet over the weekend to discuss measures to support oil prices.Exxon Mobil jumped $2.78, or 3.6 percent, to $80.89 a share, and Chevron rose $3.40, or 4.44 percent, to $79.93.The Treasury’s 10-year bill rose 1 4/32, to 106 19/32. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, was at 2.98 percent, down from 3.11 percent Tuesday.Stocks dropped in Europe and stayed mixed in Asia, amid a worsening outlook for the global economy. The FTSE-100 in London lost 0.44 percent; the DAX in Frankfurt was unchanged; and the CAC-40 in Paris fell 1.24 percent.“There’s starting to be a sense that by the end of 2009 the light will be visible at the end of the tunnel in the U.S. economy,” said Franz Wenzel, deputy director for investment strategy at Axa Investment Managers in Paris. But investors in Europe expect 2009 to be “a lost year,” he said, with a “substantial recession.”The collapse of a $66 billion hostile bid by BHP Billiton, the world’s largest mining company, for its rival Rio Tinto also weighed on sentiment, he said. BHP announced on Tuesday that it was ending its bid because the credit crisis had made a deal too risky.1007 2008-11-27 “The government should return the power to people in a new election,” the commander, Gen. Anupong Paochinda, told reporters after meeting with business leaders.“We are not pressuring the government,” he said. “We are just giving advice about the way out for the country in this situation.”But in a country with a long history of military coups — the most recent was just two years ago — General Anupong’s statements carried particular weight.Despite months of protests that have hobbled the government, however, Somchai Wongsawat, Thailand’s third prime minister since the 2006 coup, rejected the general’s advice, in a nationally televised address.“I assure you, ladies and gentlemen, that this government was elected by the people under the king,” Mr. Somchai said late Wednesday. “The government will carry out its duty to the fullest for the benefit of the country and the benefit of the people.”He requested that protesters leave both airports and said the cabinet would discuss the situation Thursday.A court late on Wednesday backed the government’s position, ordering protesters to leave the Suvarnabhumi airport.But the mood there was defiant. Protesters — largely representing an established urban elite and middle class who feel threatened by the government’s empowerment of the poorer rural areas — spent the night in the terminal. They took over the control tower at midday and consolidated their command, forcing the cancellation of all flights. The protesters, who accuse the government of being the proxy of the target of the 2006 coup, the exiled former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra, made a large sign that said, “Put an end to the puppet Parliament.”“I am often asked whether we will stop our protests if the prime minister resigns,” Sondhi Limthongkul, a protest leader, told thousands of cheering supporters. “You must quit first, and then we will sit and talk.”From a makeshift stage, Mr. Sondhi added: “Are we going to stay here tonight? The answer is definitely, yes!”The Suvarnabhumi airport was seized as Thailand entered its peak season for tourism, which provides millions of jobs and billions of dollars. Stranded travelers, many of them furious vacationing foreigners who vowed never to return, spent the night in the airport.The ability of protesters to shut two airports and — as they have also done this week, government offices — , has raised concerns about the government’s ability to maintain order.Very few police officers were at the Suvarnabhumi airport on Wednesday amid the thousands of protesters. Stranded passengers were evacuated from the terminal by airport staff members throughout Wednesday and sent to Bangkok hotels. “Canceled” flashed across the flight-schedule screens, and check-in counters were not staffed.Protesters set up cooking equipment and prepared vats of food in the terminal, giving it a festival-like atmosphere.But the threat of violence, which has sporadically erupted in months of protests, remained great. The United States Embassy in Bangkok advised Americans to “stay away from the airport, given the potential for violence and civil disobedience.”In Chiang Mai, government supporters killed an antigovernment activist on Wednesday, dragging him from his car before shooting him, Reuters reported.Mr. Somchai, the prime minister, is faced with a wrenching decision: whether to order the airports cleared of protesters, an operation that would require a force of thousands.Crackdowns on protesters in October resulted in at least two deaths and hundreds of injuries, caused mainly by tear gas grenades and canisters that exploded with unusually strong impact.That Suvarnabhumi airport is the focus of tensions is in some ways apt. A complex of glass and steel that Mr. Thaksin pushed through after decades of false starts and delays, in a process plagued by accusations of corruption and nepotism, it represents what Mr. Thaksin’s supporters admired most about him and what his detractors despised.The airport was opened just days after Mr. Thaksin was removed from power.1008 2008-11-27 CREDIT THAW The federal government made two big moves to help consumers, but some people are ineligible while others will have to wait months before the benefits trickle down.

Some retailing analysts even fear it could condition consumers to shop only when merchandise is deeply discounted.Still, stores plan to pull out all the stops on Friday and through the weekend. After all, November and December sales make up 25 to 40 percent of many retailers’ annual sales, according to the National Retail Federation, an industry group. (The day after Thanksgiving is called Black Friday because it was, historically, the day that many retailers moved into the black, or became profitable for the year.)The deals were laid out in circulars tucked into newspapers on Thanksgiving Day, on retailers’ Web sites and on sites dedicated to sales and shopping strategies, like and . Many stores planned to open just after midnight Friday morning, and others — including Wal-Mart, Sears, Macy’s, , , Toys “R” Us and Old Navy — set their openings for 5 a.m. will open at 6 a.m. and at 7 a.m.Consumers have been resisting the stores’ entreaties. In the first two weeks of November, retail categories like apparel, luxury goods and electronics and appliances all had double-digit sales declines, according to SpendingPulse sales reports from . Grocers are just about the only stores doing well in this economy, as people hole up and eat at home instead of going to restaurants.“If you’re in a sector that doesn’t sell food, you’re under a lot of pressure,” said Michael McNamara, vice president of SpendingPulse.Projections vary about the likely success of this year’s Black Friday and the days following. A National Retail Federation survey said fewer people planned to shop this weekend — as many as 128 million, down from about 135 million who said they planned to shop Thanksgiving weekend sales last year. But a survey from the International Council of Shopping Centers found the opposite, that more people plan to shop this year.Retailers are hoping for the best.“This year I expect it to be bigger than ever,” said Gerald L. Storch, chairman and chief executive of Toys “R” Us. Citing the down economy, he explained: “I believe it will be huge because Black Friday is all about bargains.”Ken Hicks, president and chief merchandising officer for , said the day “probably will not be as big as it has been recently, but it’s still going to be a huge day.”While bargains are already on offer at J. C. Penney, Mr. Hicks said the company’s doorbusters would make it worth lining up before sunrise. Over all, J. C. Penney, which plans to open at 4 a.m., will have 20 percent more specials this year than last year, like a five-piece luggage set for $38.88. “We’re selling some items purely intended to drive that traffic in,” Mr. Hicks said.So are other retailers. Stores, which had a few midnight openings last year, planned to open more than half of its 200 stores at the Cinderella hour this year. Almost everything in those stores, including one-day-only specials, will be an additional 20 percent off until 10 a.m.At Toys “R” Us, anyone who buys a black 16-gigabyte will get a $50 gift card. Wal-Mart, the nation’s largest retailer, will offer jeans and sherpa-lined hooded sweatshirts for $4 and $8. Even will have Black Friday deals, like a coffee maker for $15.For the holiday season as a whole, retailing analysts expect weak sales. Standard & Poor’s Equity Research is predicting a 5 percent decline, calling the holiday shopping season “the gloomiest in recent decades.” The National Retail Federation, which made one of the more optimistic predictions, said sales would increase 2.2 percent, well below the average 4.4 percent yearly increase retailers have enjoyed for the last decade.The only real winners this season are bargain-hunters with money to spend. With more deals on the way after Friday, shoppers can get impressive savings without necessarily having to brave the crowds or the cold on the day after Thanksgiving.“There’s a small cadre of people who love Black Friday shopping,” Mr. de Grandpre said. “Everybody else hates it.”1019 2008-11-28 The Allhat experience is worth remembering now, as some policy experts and government officials call for more such studies to directly compare drugs or other treatments, as a way to stem runaway medical costs and improve care.The aftereffects of the study show how hard it is to change medical practice, even after a government-sanctioned trial costing $130 million produced what appeared to be solid evidence.A confluence of factors blunted Allhat’s impact. One was the simple difficulty of persuading doctors to change their habits. Another was scientific disagreement, as many academic medical experts criticized the trial’s design and the government’s interpretation of the results.Moreover, pharmaceutical companies responded by heavily marketing their own expensive hypertension drugs and, in some cases, paying speakers to publicly interpret the Allhat results in ways that made their products look better.“The pharmaceutical industry ganged up and attacked, discredited the findings,” Dr. Furberg said. He eventually resigned in frustration as chairman of the study’s steering committee, the expert group that continues to oversee analysis of data from the trial. One member of that committee received more than $200,000 from Pfizer, largely in speaking fees, the year after the Allhat results were released.There was another factor: medicine moves on. Even before Allhat was finished, and certainly since then, new drugs appeared. Others, meanwhile, became available as generics, reducing the cost advantage of the diuretics. And many doctors have shifted to using two or more drugs together, helped by pharmaceutical companies that offer combination pills containing two medicines.So Allhat’s main query — which drug to use first — became “an outdated question that doesn’t have huge relevance to the majority of people’s clinical practices,” said Dr. John M. Flack, the chairman of medicine at Wayne State University, who was not involved in the study and has consulted for some drug makers.Dr. Sean Tunis, a former chief medical officer for Medicare, remains an advocate for comparative-effectiveness studies. But, as Allhat showed, “they are hard to do, expensive to do and provoke a lot of political pushback,” said Dr. Tunis, who now runs the nonprofit Center for Medical Technology Policy, which tries to arrange such trials.“There’s a lot of magical thinking,” he said, “that it will all be science and won’t be politics.”Promising better ways to treat high blood pressure, drug companies in the 1980s introduced a variety of medications, including ones known as calcium channel blockers and ACE inhibitors.Although there was no real evidence the newer pills were better, diuretics fell to 27 percent of hypertension prescriptions in 1992, from 56 percent in 1982. Use of the more expensive pills added an estimated $3.1 billion to the nation’s medical bill over that period.So the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, part of the federal National Institutes of Health, decided to compare the various drugs’ ability to prevent heart attacks, strokes and other cardiovascular problems. “This was a big-bucks issue,” said Dr. Jeffrey Cutler, the Heart, Lung and Blood Institute’s project director for the study.Allhat — short for the Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial — began enrolling patients with high blood pressure, age 55 and older, in 1994, with more than 42,000 people eventually participating. Patients were randomly assigned one of four drugs: a diuretic called chlorthalidone; an ACE inhibitor called lisinopril, which AstraZeneca sold as Zestril; a calcium channel blocker, amlodipine, sold by Pfizer as Norvasc; and an alpha blocker, doxazosin, which Pfizer sold as Cardura.Cardura was added only after Pfizer, which had already agreed to contribute $20 million to the trial’s costs, increased that to $40 million, Dr. Cutler said.Pfizer’s bet on Cardura proved a big mistake. As the Allhat data came in, patients taking Cardura were nearly twice as likely as those receiving the diuretic to require hospitalization for heart failure, a condition in which the heart cannot pump blood adequately. Concerned, the Heart, Lung and Blood Institute announced in March 2000 that it had stopped the Cardura part of the trial.What happened next provided the first signs that the Allhat evidence might not be universally embraced.Rather than warn doctors that Cardura might not be suited for hypertension, Pfizer circulated a memo to its sales representatives suggesting scripted responses they could use to reassure doctors that Cardura was safe, according to documents released from a patients’ lawsuit against the company.And in an e-mail message unearthed in those same court documents, a Pfizer sales executive boasted to colleagues that company employees had diverted some European doctors attending an American cardiology conference from hearing a presentation on the Allhat results and Cardura. “The good news,” the message said, “is that they were quite brilliant in sending their key physicians to sightsee rather than hear Curt Furberg slam Pfizer once again!”Pfizer declined to comment on the messages.The Food and Drug Administration waited a year before convening a meeting of outside experts to discuss Cardura’s safety. At that session, some of the experts sharply challenged the conclusions of the Allhat organizers. They argued that the heart failure cases might have been false readings and that an inadequate dose of Cardura had been used in the trial.By the end of the daylong meeting, Dr. Robert J. Temple, a senior F.D.A. official, was clearly exasperated by the experts’ varying interpretations of a supposedly definitive trial.“This is the largest and best attempt to compare outcomes we are ever going to see,” he said. “And people are extremely doubtful about whether it has shown anything at all.”The committee decided that there was no need to issue an urgent warning to doctors and patients about Cardura.Cardura sales held up in 2000. But the next year, worldwide sales fell to $552 million, from $795 million. Prescriptions for all alpha blockers fell 22 percent from 1999 to 2002 after having risen before then, according to one study.Pfizer’s decision to stop promoting Cardura in late 2000, after the drug lost patent protection, was a factor in the decline. But Allhat clearly was, too.The main Allhat results were announced in December 2002 at a news conference in Washington and published in The Journal of the American Medical Association.In the primary target outcome of the trial — the prevention of heart attacks — the three remaining drugs were proved equal. But patients receiving the Norvasc calcium channel blocker from Pfizer had a 38 percent greater incidence of heart failure than those on the diuretic. And those receiving the ACE inhibitor from AstraZeneca had a 15 percent higher risk of strokes and a 19 percent higher risk of heart failure.Moreover, the diuretic cost only about $25 a year, compared with $250 for an ACE inhibitor and $500 for a calcium channel blocker. So the diuretic was declared the winner.But some hypertension experts accused the government of overstating the case for the diuretics, as a way to cut medical spending.“There was a feeling there was a political and economic agenda as much as a scientific agenda,” said Dr. Michael Weber, a professor of medicine at the Health Science Center at Brooklyn, part of the State University of New York, who had been an investigator in the study but afterward became one of its leading critics. “They pushed beyond what the data allowed them to say.”Critics said the rules of the trial had favored the diuretics. If the first drug did not adequately lower blood pressure — as happened in more than 60 percent of cases — a second drug could be added. But that second drug was usually a type that worked better with diuretics than with ACE inhibitors.There were also more new cases of diabetes among the patients who took diuretics, although experts argued over how meaningful that finding was.Adding fuel to the debate, an Australian study released two months after Allhat found an ACE inhibitor superior to a diuretic. The proper lesson to draw from Allhat, some critics contended, was that what matters most is how much blood pressure is lowered, not which drug is used to do it. For these and other reasons, European hypertension experts discounted Allhat.Allhat’s proponents discounted the Australian study as less authoritative, and they dismissed the other criticisms.Still, the arguments “muddied the waters,” said Dr. Randall S. Stafford of Stanford, who studied the effect of Allhat on prescriptions. “The message,” he said, “was no longer as clear to physicians.”By the time the Allhat results were released, lisinopril, the ACE inhibitor, had become generic. That meant AstraZeneca and Merck, which sold a version of the compound as Prinivil, had less interest in defending their drugs.Not so Pfizer. Norvasc was the best-selling hypertension treatment in the world, with sales of $3.8 billion in 2002, and Pfizer’s second-biggest drug behind the cholesterol medication Lipitor.The company set out to accentuate the positive. In a news release after the Allhat results were announced, it said that Norvasc was found to be “comparable to the diuretic in fatal coronary heart disease, heart attacks and stroke.” And in a medical journal advertisement, it proclaimed “ALL HATs off” to its drug.Neither the news release nor the ad, however, included the 38 percent greater risk of heart failure with Norvasc in the Allhat study.Nor did Hank McKinnell, then Pfizer’s chief executive, mention heart failure in lauding the results during his quarterly earnings conference call with analysts a few weeks after the Allhat report was released. “Contrary to what you might have read in the press,” Mr. McKinnell said, “Allhat is extremely positive for Norvasc. It will be our job to explain that to the medical community.”Dr. Paul K. Whelton, president of Loyola University Health System and the current chairman of the Allhat steering committee, said that Pfizer and other drug companies “took what was in their best interest and ran with those, and conveniently didn’t mention other things.”Pfizer defends its actions. Dr. Michael Berelowitz, the head of Pfizer’s global medical organization, said that in the trial’s design, heart failure was merely one component of a broader measure of various cardiovascular problems. And in that broader measure, Dr. Berelowitz said, there was no difference between Norvasc and the diuretic. Also, he said, the label for Norvasc already contained a precaution about heart failure.“Further action regarding the heart failure finding was therefore not considered necessary,” he said in a statement in response to questions.Pfizer was not the only company promoting its drugs. The drug giant Novartis, for example, was spending heavily to market Diovan, a leader among a class of hypertension drugs called angiotensin receptor blockers, which were too new to have been included in Allhat. Diovan, which had more than $5 billion in sales last year, sells for $1.88 to $3.20 a pill on drugstore.com, compared with 8 to 31 cents for a diuretic.No company, though, was spending money to promote generic diuretics. So the federal Heart, Lung and Blood Institute recruited Allhat investigators, provided them with training and sent them to proselytize fellow physicians. In all, 147 investigators gave nearly 1,700 talks and reached more than 18,000 doctors and other health care providers.But it was a coffee-and-doughnuts operation compared with the sumptuous dinners that pharmaceutical companies used to market to doctors. Moreover, the steering committee’s outreach program did not get under way until about three years after the results were published.Dr. Stafford of Stanford said the outreach seemed to have had a slight effect on increasing the use of diuretics.The results of Pfizer’s efforts are easier to quantify. Norvasc sales continued to grow to $4.9 billion in 2006, falling only after the drug lost patent protection in the United States in 2007.Tensions about industry influence reached even the study’s own steering committee. Dr. Furberg, the chairman, bluntly accused some members of the committee of being agents of the industry.One member, Dr. Richard H. Grimm Jr. of the University of Minnesota, had been receiving tens of thousands of dollars a year from Pfizer since at least 1997, according to reports that pharmaceutical companies file in that state.In 2003, the year after the Allhat results were published, Dr. Grimm’s payments from Pfizer soared to more than $200,000 — an increase that The New York Times reported in 2007.Dr. Grimm said in a recent interview that about half those fees in 2003 came from giving about 100 Pfizer-sponsored talks to doctors about Allhat. Dr. Grimm said he gave mainly the standard Allhat-sanctioned talk. But instead of saying diuretics were outright better than the other drugs, he said they were as good or better.Meanwhile, Dr. Grimm had led an effort to remove Dr. Furberg from his position on the grounds that he had not been impartial.“He had a vendetta against the calcium channel blockers,” Dr. Grimm said. Dr. Furberg had been publicly questioning the safety of those drugs based on some studies he did in the 1990s. The effort to oust Dr. Furberg failed in 2001. But in August 2004, Dr. Furberg resigned as chairman, contending that there had not been enough effort to disseminate the Allhat message.Dr. Whelton, who took over as chairman, said that the study’s message was never compromised by industry ties on the steering committee.“Curt is a wonderful guy who is a crusader,” said Dr. Whelton, who did not have industry ties and was not involved in the effort to unseat Dr. Furberg. “He has certainly rubbed a lot of people, even good friends, the wrong way.”Experts see several lessons to be learned from Allhat.One is that “all trials have flaws” that leave the results open to interpretation, said Dr. Robert M. Califf, a cardiologist at Duke who served on the safety monitoring committee of Allhat.Another is that providing doctors information is “necessary, but not sufficient” to urge them to change their practices, said Dr. Carolyn M. Clancy, director of the federal Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, which itself conducts studies comparing different medical treatments.And while insurers can influence practice through reimbursement policies, they did not seem to have pushed strongly for diuretics after Allhat, in part because some of the other drugs had become generic.Even the cost-conscious medical system at the Department of Veterans Affairs did not require diuretics, because too many doctors would probably have requested exceptions, said Dr. William C. Cushman, chief of preventive medicine at the department’s medical center in Memphis.Dr. Cushman, a member of the Allhat steering committee, said diuretic use in the system was still “much lower” than he thought it should be.Dr. Clancy said that her agency was now mainly using insurance records to judge how treatments perform. While clinical trials are the gold standard, she said, they are costly and time-consuming.And, she added, “You might be answering a question that by the time you are done, no longer feels quite as relevant.”1020 2008-11-28 DuBose was 24-23 in four years at Alabama, and he was named the Southeastern Conference coach of the year in 1999, when the Tide won the conference. But DuBose was fired after Alabama plummeted from a No. 3 preseason ranking to a 3-8 finish in 2000. He had already been disciplined by the university after a secretary filed a sexual harassment complaint against him and he admitted to having an affair with her. At the same time, an N.C.A.A. investigation was under way that resulted in Alabama’s being put on probation for five years for improper recruiting and other violations.DuBose said he spent some time soul-searching after leaving Alabama.“Initially I was O.K. with it,” he said. “I felt I would get another job. Something good would happen. Those things didn’t happen and I became angry. Angry at the world. Bitter at everybody except myself. When in reality, the only one I had a right to be angry with was myself because I was the one who messed it up.”DuBose did not receive offers to return to football, and decided he would step away from the sport for a while.“I moved to a little lake house down in Gantt, Ala., my wife and I,” he said. “And I just missed football so badly. So I promised the good Lord then, if he would let me get back in, it didn’t matter if it was the head coach, assistant coach, high school or college or back in the N.F.L., that I would coach and I would coach with a passion.”Months later, DuBose got a high school coaching job in Alabama. After moving on to another high school job in 2003, he got a call in 2005 from David Saunders, who was then the head coach of Millsaps. Saunders offered DuBose a job as his defensive coordinator.“The timing was perfect,” DuBose said. “It worked out that David next year had a chance to go back to Ole Miss, which is his dream job, and I was fortunate enough to get this job here.”Millsaps quarterback Juan Joseph is glad DuBose came to this Division III school. Joseph, who has thrown for 3,130 yards and 31 touchdowns this season, is one of three seniors nominated for the Conerly Trophy, the award for the top college football player in Mississippi.“It feels good, man, especially where we came from,” Joseph said. “My freshmen year we were like 2-7. It feels great to be in this position.”DuBose said his position now, in many ways, was better than it had been in 2000. He was an assistant before accepting the head coaching job at Alabama, taking over for Gene Stallings in 1997.“I thought I had all the answers,” DuBose said. “I was a good assistant coach, but I didn’t have a clue what being a head coach was. I just looked at the head coach and said he wasn’t doing anything anyway. The assistant coaches are doing all of the work, so sure I will go hire assistant coaches and let them coach. And that’s what I did. And I sort of left it alone instead of managing and motivating and doing the things that a head coach has got to do.”DuBose says that he has surrounded himself at Millsaps with good people and that he is happy.“I am at peace,” he said. “After getting back into coaching, I found that peace again.”1021 2008-11-28 While many people who own, rent or otherwise control sleeping space are packing in family and friends without charge, many others smell profits and are auctioning off their homes, rooms, sofas and even spots on the basement floor. All of this enterprise has prompted complaints that some in the area are exploiting the historic moment by price-gouging.Such high prices are “barring earnest people who want to witness and participate in something remarkable, positive, and promising” from coming to the capital, wrote one poster on Craigslist, who had let out his or her home for “a very modest sum” and urged others to do the same.“Let’s act like we really do want it to be a democracy,” the poster wrote.But another poster responded that it costs money to rent out your house.Besides, this poster added: “Do I deserve to avail myself to a little windfall profit from the smart investment I made and sacrifice for to live so centrally? Darn right I do. So get over it.”One of the highest prices obtained so far appears to be $57,000 for a week in a three-bedroom home near Chantilly, Va., about 24 miles from Washington.Or at least that is what Keith Bell, a lawyer for the federal government, said he was told by the lawyer who reviewed the contract between the homeowner and the renter, who is coming from overseas.The price prompted Mr. Bell, 42, to think he might get even more for his home, a four-bedroom brick Colonial in Lanham, Md., which is about 11 miles from Washington.Mr. Bell then posted an offer on Craigslist: $60,000 for the week.“After hearing the ridiculous amounts that people were renting their houses/apartments for, I decided to post this ad to see if it would generate any interest at all,” Mr. Bell said.It did not. A couple of days later, he altered his pricing structure to $6,000 a night, which, he said, was “more in line with market rates.”You can spend a lot less. There is a three-bedroom home in the Brookland section of Washington for $350 a night, minimum two nights, plus $50 for each additional person.Or you can take your chance on a spot at a group house on Capitol Hill (with housemates), advertised with this humble request: “Make me an offer.”But you can also pay a lot more — $25,000 for a “weekend rental” for a one-bedroom apartment in Arlington, Va. (“luxurious air mattress available”).The owner of a houseboat docked in the Washington Channel is asking $20,000 for a week’s stay on his 43-foot River Queen. The Champagne is free.The frenzied search for inauguration housing has led to at least one new specialty Web site, inauguralhomes.com. It was started earlier this month by four men in their 30s with backgrounds in real estate and finance. (“It’s quiet on the mortgage front,” lamented one of the founders, Andre Butters, 30.)Unlike Craigslist, inauguralhomes.com charges a fee — $9.95 to list a property and $24.95 to have it showcased on the site as a “featured” home. The founders say 10 percent of the proceeds will go to help homeless people.The site has not yet attracted the range of options listed on Craigslist, which is far more established, but less expensive properties stand out because the offerings are arranged by price.The sudden flurry of rental activity has created such a booming business that the District of Columbia government has thrown up its hands at trying to regulate it and is instead trying to encourage it.The district is suspending rules that require residents to get a business license if they want to rent out space. It is also lifting the requirement for a property inspection.“If we insisted on applications, we effectively could not have handled the thousands we would have gotten,” said Peter Nickles, the district’s attorney general. “We wanted to strike a balance between practicality and being a welcoming city.”To that end, the district is providing a model lease contract online for residents and visitors to use as a template.Online travel sites show that almost everything within the metro area is booked for the day of the inauguration and at least three days before. The presidential suite at the Ritz Carlton Georgetown, however, is still available: four nights for $99,000 (that includes a post-inaugural three-night stay at the Ritz on Grand Cayman).A brief window may open in the next week or so when some lower-priced hotel rooms come back on the market, either because travelers have not paid their deposits or the deals have otherwise fallen through, say officials at Destination D.C., the local visitors’ bureau.But any hotel room that opens up will probably cost at least $500 a night, they say, and require a four-night minimum. And these rooms are not likely to show up on the online travel sites, meaning would-be visitors have to start dialing hotels randomly.“Each hotel is managing it themselves, so they can take care of special clients, higher-yielding clients,” said Bill Hanbury, chief executive of Destination D.C.“People are sitting down with AAA books and working their way through Loudoun County,” Mr. Hanbury said. “It’s regrettable, but there’s so much demand.”Those demanders include some of his old high school “friends” who are suddenly calling to ask how he is — and whether he has a spare couch. Some people who thought they had rooms are finding out otherwise. Dr. Brian Sumner, an internist in New York, made reservations in October at a hotel in College Park, Md., through an online booking service, for $89 a night.Last week, when he heard about the housing shortage, Dr. Sumner called the hotel to confirm his reservations. There were none. He said the hotel told him that the booking firm does not necessarily check with the hotel.Another possibility, of course, is that the hotel “lost” his reservation because it realized it could charge a higher rate. Either way, Dr. Sumner said he was scrambling online for accommodations.And for those Washingtonians who are not necessarily looking to make money but want to get out of town to avoid the crush, there are plenty of swaps on the market.A homeowner in Santa Monica, Calif., (“garden and sitting area, surrounded by birds of paradise, flowers, banana and lemon tree and fire pit”) makes this appeal on Craigslist: “My 17-year-old and I worked very hard on the election. Working both in Nevada (registering) and Denver (election week). If you truly don’t wish to stay in D.C., come and enjoy our beautiful home and our great weather. Please — don’t be a gouger for this special event — we need you!”1022 2008-11-28 Rosie O’Donnell’s Wednesday night special on NBC, “Rosie Live,” was supposed to be a tribute to the variety shows of the 1970s, but she added a Nixonian twist: Christmas songs, tap-dancing twins and an enemies list.In between skits, celebrity cameos and hokey novelty acts, the legendarily thin-skinned Ms. O’Donnell found time to take potshots at some of her favorite targets, including Donald Trump, Nancy Grace and Bill O’Reilly. She left out Barbara Walters, with whom Ms. O’Donnell has been feuding ever since Ms. O’Donnell left “The View,” perhaps reluctant to draw attention to Ms. Walters’s interview with Barack and Michelle Obama on ABC the same night. (Even that Barbara Walters special had a ’70s feel, as Ms. Walters reprised her famous interview with Jimmy Carter, asking President-elect Obama if he intended to turn off the lights in the White House personally to conserve energy.)Ms. O’Donnell’s self-referential swats at detractors were light, but they clashed with the context, lending a hard, contemporary edge to what was intended to be a corny, heartfelt homage to variety shows of yesteryear, like “The Sonny and Cher Comedy Hour” and “The Carol Burnett Show.” So did her bizarre product-placement duet with Jane Krakowski, a star of the NBC comedy “30 Rock,” who performed a sultry striptease in front of a giant monitor flashing images of White Castle hamburgers, BlackBerrys and Crest Whitestrips.Nostalgia was also pushed hard. After her monologue Ms. O’Donnell sang a duet of “City Lights” alongside a sequined, slightly tremulous Liza Minnelli, who rose out of a trap door to join the host onstage. Ms. O’Donnell beamed at Harry Connick Jr. as he channeled Perry Como, crooning “It’s Beginning to Look a Lot Like Christmas” while wearing a Santa hat.Alec Baldwin hit Conan O’Brien in the face with a pie, spinning cowboys danced with ropes — albeit in tune to a 1980s hit by Dead or Alive, “You Spin Me Round (Like a Record)” — and Alanis Morissette sang a sad ballad in long dark hair and thick bangs, like Cher.Ms. O’Donnell, 46, is usually pretty good at borrowing from the past. Her talk show, which ran from 1996 to 2002, was a hit, mainly because Ms. O’Donnell sought to recreate the kindly, good-humored sensibility of “The Mike Douglas Show.” (She asked celebrity guests softball questions and tossed soft squishy balls at her audience.) Ellen DeGeneres picked up that baton and made her own talk show a hit. Ms. O’Donnell went on “The View” and took that show hostage, stoking ratings — and her own reputation for erratic rage — by feuding with the likes of Mr. Trump and even her co-hosts. (She and Ms. Walters had a bitter, highly public spat, collateral damage from the Trump war.)1023 2008-11-28 The proposal is seen by many as rhetorical — a bargaining chip to use with a new American president. But if carried out, it would mark Kaliningrad’s first rearming against the West since the end of the Soviet Union, and another twist in an old identity crisis: Is it Russia’s window, open to Europe, or a turret for firing on it?“The phrase ‘military stronghold’ was gradually forgotten here,” said Vadim Smirnov, a columnist for Kaliningradskaya Pravda, the region’s largest newspaper. “Experience shows that it was premature.”The streetscape of Kaliningrad testifies to its peculiar status. Around the corner from generic Soviet monuments are cobblestone streets and red-roofed houses built before World War II, when it was a German city called Königsberg. Free trade policy has transformed this city into a huge duty free shop, crammed with fashionable restaurants and small businesses selling Italian handbags, French bath soaps, Polish light fixtures.No less transformed are its people, who number around one million. Kaliningraders live more than 200 miles from the Russian border; they bring their grandchildren to Polish water parks and stock up at Ikea in Gdansk. Younger ones ski in Austria or shuttle goods to Central Europe. There is a deep vein of Russian patriotism here, as you would expect from a military town. But the pull of Europe is strong.“We’re closer to Berlin than Moscow,” said Alexei Petrov, 39, a gym teacher who is driving a taxi between jobs.Those links with Europe — culturally warm and economically central — have colored Kaliningraders’ reaction to Mr. Medvedev’s announcement. Lyudmila M. Anokha, the director of the Kaliningrad Zoo, found herself in an awkward position last month when she held a contest to name a new baby giraffe. One of the most popular suggestions was “Iskander,” but Ms. Anokha immediately saw the problem.“The giraffe was delivered to us by the Berlin Zoo,” she said. “The giraffe came from the West. The Iskanders would be pointed toward the West. We at the zoo are beyond politics.”The Iskander deployment is popular among Russians as a whole, who overwhelmingly see the American missile defense plan as a direct threat on their borders. A poll released last week by Moscow’s Public Opinion Foundation showed that 62 percent of respondents approved of the Iskander deployment if the missile defense facilities are built. Only 13 percent of them criticized the plans, with 4 percent dismissing them as “intimidation.”The same stalwart support can be found in Kaliningrad. In 2004, when Poland and Lithuania joined the European Union, new visa and customs regulations stoked fears that Kaliningraders were being cut off behind a “blue curtain,” after the color of the union flag. Since then, those regulations have helped to deprive them of much of the freedom of movement that they enjoyed during the Yeltsin years. They already feel encircled, and the proposed missile defense site in Poland — an American base supplied with 10 interceptor missiles — stokes old passions.“When someone threatens your country, every person must respond,” said Ms. Anokha, the zoo director. “We are not the ones unearthing the ax of war.”In public, there has been little debate about the Iskander plan. For one thing, people here are accustomed to living near an arsenal — including nuclear-tipped missiles that were staged here during the cold war. The bigger threat, for many, was their removal: Since the 1980s, the number of troops here has been reduced to fewer than 20,000, from 320,000, according to the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London. Rumors that the Baltic Fleet might be relocated met with “horror” in Kaliningrad, according to Mr. Abramov, the political scientist.“The presence of troops was seen as a guarantee that Russia would not abandon us,” he said. “There are hotheads in Poland and Lithuania who would like to incorporate us. The Baltic Fleet calms them down.”In private, however, many Kaliningraders say they are nervous about how the Iskander plan would affect them. The region’s economy is dependent on foreign tourists and foreign investment, to say nothing of the freedom to travel in Europe. Solomon I. Ginzburg, a deputy in Kaliningrad’s regional Parliament, said a poll of 1,800 of his constituents showed that 37 percent of them were “categorically against” the deployment of Iskanders, whereas only 20 percent supported it.The most visible objections have come from Vitautas V. Lopata, an opposition deputy in the Parliament. Mr. Lopata, a wealthy businessman, publishes his own newspaper because he cannot gain coverage in the Kaliningrad press, “even if I pay for it,” he said.In his most recent issue, he wrote that with Mr. Medvedev’s announcement, “we have, with our own hands, pushed Europe away from Russia,” ignoring Kaliningrad’s economic dependence on its neighbors. He said many citizens agreed with him, but kept their comments private, because “where can they express this opinion?”“If you deploy missile forces, investment ends, tourism ends,” he said in an interview. “You don’t go visit your neighbor if he’s drunk and he’s holding a loaded gun.”As people rushed past rows of shops, jewel-bright in a gathering snowstorm, most confessed that the missile deployment was not on their minds. Some had not even heard of it. But here and there was passionate opposition — from a grandmother selling five beets on a sidewalk, who said she would join street protests against the deployment, or from the taxi driver, Mr. Pavlov, who exclaimed with frustration, “Nobody is threatening anyone here.”Natalya Gorobets, 41, who works for a tour agency, seemed to draw herself up with pride at the mention of the Iskanders, which she said “demonstrate that Russia is capable of giving an answer” to the United States. At the next desk, Viktoria Nishchenko, 28, was not so sure: She was thinking about travel.“I just don’t want to go to a consulate and be told, ‘Oh, you’re from Kaliningrad. Stay there with your weapons,’ ” she said.1024 2008-11-28 “I’m not scared of writing people up,” said Mr. Strothers, 23, who left his ticket-writing position in June to train as an emergency medical technician but is now looking to be rehired.Level One traffic agents like Mr. Strothers earn less than $30,000 a year. They are often harassed — or worse — by motorists, a reaction common enough to prompt state lawmakers to pass a law this year that made it a felony to assault a traffic agent.So what motivates an agent to perform so far above the norm?“I’m one of those rare people who loved the job,” Mr. Strothers said.Though Mr. Strothers earned an extra $12,000 in overtime last year, he said he was not aware of any policy that has supervisors steering overtime to their best producers. He said his only rewards from the city were a pat on the back and the assignment of a new Chevy Impala for his patrols.Chief Michael Collins, a police spokesman, said, “All agents are eligible for overtime.”Unlike in the old days of written tickets, agents using the handheld devices now scan data off a vehicle’s registration sticker. But they still must use a stylus to enter up to seven screens of information on the violation.Marvin Robbins, a union delegate for Local 983 of District Council 37, which covers traffic agents who drive tow trucks, said that while supervisors never dictate ticket quotas, agents who want to patrol in a car, instead of on foot, had better issue 40 tickets or more each shift.Could an agent looking to make that number write two tickets within a minute?“No, impossible,” Mr. Robbins said. “I don’t see anybody doing two tickets a minute.”Told that an agent had done it 34 times in one day, Mr. Robbins said it might be possible “if all the information is there and you’re only changing the plate and if the next vehicle is in line.”Mr. Strothers said it was clearly possible to write two tickets a minute.What about three?“It can be done,” he said.Actually, Mr. Strothers said he easily could have written more tickets — perhaps 300 — on his record-setting tour.“I didn’t try that hard,” he said, noting that he did not even bother to ticket at expired meters that day, the day after Thanksgiving, which was the most-ticketed day of the year. People assume it is a holiday, Mr. Strothers said, and even he was so stunned at the number of illegally parked cars he had to call the office to make sure he could issue tickets.Mr. Strothers began his record-setting day at 7:50 a.m., using his handheld ticket writer to cite an Acura in a no-parking zone.The O’Neil printer on his belt spat out a $60 summons, and he tucked it into an orange envelope and stuck it under the windshield wiper.The car was also missing an inspection sticker, and he zapped it with a second ticket, for $65, one minute later.Over the next five hours and nine minutes, city records showed, he issued 225 more parking tickets — an average of almost one a minute. Then, he said, “I took a break.”Most of the tickets, 206, were for violating alternate side of the street parking regulations.Mr. Strothers said he honored a five-minute grace period before issuing tickets at the expiration of legal parking, a discretionary leniency that once was city policy. But the records show that 20 of his tickets were written within two minutes of the time when cars had to switch sides of the street. That kind of exactitude — the aggrieved would call it zealotry — has led to hot words between motorists and the people who write tickets. But not in Mr. Strothers’s case.“I know how to talk to people and explain what I did, while they may not like it,” he said.On his record-setting day, when he holstered his ticket writer at 1 p.m., Mr. Strothers still had more than an hour left in his shift and he had enriched the city’s coffers by $10,670 (assuming all fines were paid in full). None of this productivity came at the expense of his integrity, Mr. Strothers said. He had set a record, yes, but not by cheating.“It’s so easy to write a real ticket,” he said. “Why fake it?”1025 2008-11-28 President-elect Barack Obama did not answer MTV’s question about whether he wears boxers or briefs during the campaign, but there are no hard feelings. MTV is hosting an inaugural ball for him, The Associated Press reported. A flock of organizations are hosting all manners of balls and parties on a day when some have estimated that a million people will arrive in the capital in hopes of getting a glimpse of Mr. Obama. MTV’s event will be called “Be the Change Inaugural Ball” and will be held at the Ronald Reagan Building and International Trade Center in Washington on Jan. 20. The event will be televised live on MTV and feature artists, celebrities and government officials. To celebrate the large turnout of young voters in the election, MTV said that hundreds of young people will be invited based on their history of volunteerism in the just concluded campaign.1026 2008-11-28 British law places severe restrictions on the release and reporting of details in family law cases. As a result, details are harder to come by than those in the case, for example, of Josef Fritzl, the Austrian who kept his daughter in a cellar for 24 years, fathering her seven children.But testimony in both trials has laid bare not just horrible abuse but a seemingly wholesale breakdown in the safety net meant to protect vulnerable children.The public first heard about the case of 17-month-old Baby P., as he has been identified by the court, when his mother, her boyfriend and a tenant in their house in Haringey, north London, went on trial this month for his killing. It emerged that Baby P. had had contact with social workers, doctors, the police and child welfare agencies at least 60 times in an eight-month period in which he suffered at least 50 injuries. He had been placed on a register meant to monitor high-risk cases.Baby P.’s mother was detained and questioned several times by the police after doctors found suspicious bruises, swellings and scratches on his body. Once, it emerged, she had fooled a visiting social worker by obscuring Baby P.’s injuries with chocolate.At one point, a social worker recommended that he be placed in foster care. But British family law holds that every effort should be made to place children with friends or relatives, and Baby P. was sent to stay with a family friend for five weeks, only to return home.He was found dead in his blood-stained crib in August 2007. A pathologist who examined him afterward found that his back and eight ribs were broken, that he had a swallowed a tooth after being violently hit on the head and that some of his fingernails were missing. The pathologist said he had never seen such damage done to a child.The other case came to light when the two women complained formally in June after nearly 30 years of abuse. They said that their father began beating, raping and menacing them when they were children. Abandoned by their mother, who had also been abused, they later became pregnant time and time again, 19 times in all. Sometimes they miscarried; sometimes they aborted the babies after abnormalities were discovered in prenatal tests. Two babies died at birth.The father was able to keep the abuse a secret by moving frequently in South Yorkshire and Lincolnshire, settling in remote villages and limiting contact with outsiders. He beat the women with his hands, his feet and a belt, and he burned his younger daughter, the women said. He warned that if they went to the police, they would lose their children.There were signs that the women, or other family members, sought help from time to time. Their older brother, who left home when he was 15, reported his father to the police, but the women denied that he was their children’s father, the authorities said. When the question of paternity was raised by doctors, they also claimed that the father was someone else.The judge in the trial, Alan Goldsack, told the court it was the worst case he had seen in 40 years of criminal law. “Questions will inevitably be asked about what professionals, social and medical workers have been doing for the last 20 years,” he said.1027 2008-11-28 But after three years of bumper crops, including this one, the Taliban have succeeded almost too well, producing opium in amounts far in excess of world demand. The result, Mr. Costa said, was now a glut that was putting downward pressure on the price, which had dropped by about 20 percent.The fact that prices had not collapsed already, he said, was evidence that the Taliban, drug lords and even some farmers have stockpiled the opium, more and more of which is also being processed in Afghanistan. “Insurgents have been holding significant amounts of opium,” Mr. Costa said.The surplus — as much as 11,000 tons, or more than twice world demand in the last three years — now threatened to devalue even those stockpiles, Mr. Costa said. In 2008, Afghanistan produced 8,500 tons of opium, the United Nations found. World demand was estimated at about 4,400 tons a year.This year, the Taliban are taking a “passive stance” toward cultivation, apparently putting less pressure on Afghan farmers to plant opium poppy. “They have called a moratorium of sorts as a way of keeping the stocks stable and supporting the price,” Mr. Costa said.He said the information came from undercover surveyors in Afghanistan who closely observed the autumn planting season and the buzz around markets where opium is traded.The dynamics of the opium market pointed up the problems American and NATO forces face as they try to tamp down the narcotics trade. Eradication itself can drive up the price and put more money into the hands of the Taliban, while alienating poor Afghans who depend on the crop for their livelihoods. “We’ve got to find a way to keep the prices down and the cultivation down,” Mr. Costa said.He has suggested an emphasis not on eradication of poppy crops once they are planted, but on disrupting the trade by hitting the open-air markets where opium is bought and sold, the convoys that transport it and the labs where it is processed into more potent drugs, primarily heroin.NATO countries agreed to the logic of such an approach at a meeting in Budapest in October, Mr. Costa said, but he added that for many years, “The international community has undervalued the role of narcotics in creating the conditions for insurgency in Afghanistan.”Despite the still-high opium output, he was encouraged that an estimated one million fewer Afghans were involved in opium cultivation this year. The reasons varied and included drought in some provinces beyond the south.But it also appeared to reflect some progress among provincial governors and shuras, or local councils, in persuading farmers not to plant poppy, Mr. Costa said.Part of the incentive for farmers was the expectation of government assistance if they planted legal crops, he said. But higher prices for food crops also helped. The revenue from wheat, for instance, has tripled since 2007, the United Nations said.But without better economic opportunities, poppy will remain an attractive alternative for many in Afghanistan, the source of more than 90 percent of the world’s opium. Growth has lagged so badly, Mr. Costa noted, that the drug trade still accounts for a third of the Afghan economy. Other estimates put it at as much as one-half.Any progress this year remained vulnerable, he warned. The biggest threat was if insecurity continued to spread to previously stable parts of Afghanistan, as it has in recent months.Could the United Nations, NATO and American forces keep up the declines in opium cultivation in the face of decreased security? “The answer is no,” Mr. Costa said. “I don’t think we can.”1028 2008-11-28 Trading in Woolworths was suspended in London after the 99-year-old retailer appointed administrators to seek a buyer for its more than 900 stores.The Toronto Stock Exchange’s main index was only slightly higher on Thursday, but trading volume was light as markets in the United States were closed for the Thanksgiving holiday.On Wednesday, the S.& P. index rose 3.5 percent in New York.Across Asia, commodity and shipping stocks had soared on Thursday after China’s rate cut, the fourth in three months.The Chinese central bank’s move on Wednesday to cut its main interest rate by 1.08 percentage point gave Asian stock markets a lift.Malcolm Wood, head of Asia Pacific Strategy at Morgan Stanley in Hong Kong, said that the move was an “extraordinarily aggressive policy action in the face of extraordinarily bad news,” but that this — and a flurry of measures around the world in the past two months — was grounds for optimism in the global effort to shore up the real economy.The benchmark Nikkei 225 stock average in Tokyo was up 1.73 percent on Friday morning even though the government reported that industrial production dropped sharply in October. The S.& P./ASX 200 index in Sydney rose 3.4 percent.Stock markets in India were closed Thursday after the terrorist attack on Wednesday in Mumbai left at least 119 people dead. Indian shares opened 1.4 percent lower on Friday at the restart of trading but regained ground as the morning progressed. India’s benchmark Bombay Stock Exchange Sensitive Index, or Sensex, rebounded and was up slightly in early morning trading.While many analysts expected India’s markets to decline when they reopened, trading on other exchanges has been somewhat resilient after previous attacks. After suburban train bombings killed 180 people in Mumbai in 2006, the Bombay stock index initially fell 1.8 percent but then rallied. India has had four other attacks this year.Mr. Pankiw, the analyst in London, said that with the exception of Germany, most European government bonds were trading near record lows. Part of the reason, he said, is that after years of what he called consumer “dissaving,” savings rates are beginning to rise even as net pay falls.Nevertheless, economic data from the United States underlined the dismal global economic picture. Consumer spending dropped a full percentage point, the biggest decline since 2001, while durable goods orders fell 6.2 percent, and sales of new homes declined 5.3 percent.1029 2008-11-28 ANDREAS GURSKY     Matthew Marks...1030 2008-11-29 Some unusual centerpieces adorned the Thanksgiving tables of U.S. service personnel in Iraq....1031 2008-11-29 Brian Burke ascends to the heavens of hockey holiness today when he becomes Leafs G.M....1032 2008-11-29 Saturday's games in Russia, Finland, Sweden and Switzerland....1033 2008-11-29 Two unusual Second Sunday puzzles by Will Shortz....1034 2008-11-29 With provincial elections coming the Security Agreement was a great chance for MPs to show themselves to the voters personally....1035 2008-11-29 On its face, the task “doesn’t appear to be that complex,” said Richard Wood, Plaza’s president, but it is always complicated to make changes under “a street that’s accumulated 100 years of infrastructure at different times, and not very properly documented.” He added: “You end up with a maze of things that you have to maneuver through.”The work — which Mr. DiGiorgi said included digging pits as deep as 23 feet to lay the new pipe, 40 feet south of the old one — has attracted a lot of gapers at one of Manhattan’s busiest intersections.It has also yielded a few surprises.One of them involved the buildings that once stood on the site. They were built about a century ago and had basement vaults, extending to the curb line, that were used for storing coal. The vaults do not appear on underground maps, the way utility lines do.When the old buildings were demolished years ago and the land was turned into a parking lot, there was no need to remove the subterranean vaults, which were not in anyone’s way. Now they are.Giving an underground tour one recent cold night, Martin Giroux, Plaza’s project manager at the site, pointed out another complication. At the time the old buildings were built, the sidewalk on 42nd Street was wider and the streets were narrower. With the current narrower sidewalks, the vaults now lie not just under them but under the roadway. To brace the steel plates over 42nd Street, workers installed a 21-inch-thick beam.It is possible, even during the day, to see the remains of the brick-and-concrete arches of the old vaults, and part of the 120-foot-long new pipe, from the part of the excavation that is left uncovered: a pit behind a fence near a temporary covered pedestrian walkway.They are much more visible, as Mr. Giroux pointed out, from the unfinished subbasement of 11 Times Square.The vaults had to be drilled out and removed largely by hand, because of the tangle of lines for telephone, electricity, water and fiber-optic connections — not to mention steam pipes — running under the street at varying depths. If workers had put a backhoe in there instead of working by hand, and “hit one of those lines, it’s a catastrophe,” Mr. Giroux said.As sections of the old pipe were unearthed, they revealed the site’s history. The pipe appears to have been changed somewhat in the 1960s, Mr. Giroux said, but he estimated that its old base dates to the 1860s or 1870s.Mr. Giroux marveled at the cooperation the project had engendered. A transplanted Midwesterner, he said that he had heard horror stories about trying to work with transit officials and workers, but that he had not encountered any.Work on the new subway entrance started in May and was expected to be completed in a year.When the new pipe is done, it will be covered with sand and concrete and the street will be filled in and paved. . The scars will heal, and the city will have another skyscraper with a convenient subway connection.Asked what other projects of his had changed the city’s skyline, Mr. Wood diplomatically said that “every building is important to us.” But then he cited Riverhouse, at Battery Park City; 147 Flatbush Avenue Extension in Downtown Brooklyn (“a beautiful building”); and the “very visible” Random House building at Broadway and 56th Street. His clear implication was that 11 Times Square, with its escalators from the lobby to the subway below, would rank with them.1036 2008-11-29 The industrial chemical melamine is safe in baby formula in small amounts, the Food and Drug Administration said. The F.D.A. had said before finding the contamination that melamine might be harmful in infant formula in any amount. The F.D.A. began barring Chinese milk products from entering the country this month after melamine-tainted milk sickened more than 50,000 children in China since September. Members of Congress and consumer groups criticized the agency this week for not publicly disclosing that a formula made in the United States had also tested positive for “trace” amounts of melamine, a chemical used in plastics and fertilizer. The liquid form of Good Start Supreme infant formula with iron, by Nestlé, tested positive for melamine in as much as 0.14 parts per million, said Stephen Sundlof, director of the agency’s Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition.1037 2008-11-29 Goldman Sachs Group won approval for a New York State banking license to transform into a bank holding company and take deposits. Goldman Sachs Bank USA will have its headquarters in New York City, the New York State Banking Department said Friday in a statement. Goldman was one of nine major United States banks that received a total of $125 billion under the government’s $700 billion rescue plan for the financial industry. Goldman Sachs’s Utah-based industrial loan company will merge into its New York-state chartered trust company, Goldman Sachs Trust Company, which will in turn become a full-service New York bank with trust powers.1038 2008-11-29 Cathay Pacific said it would delay delivery of its Boeing aircraft, with list prices of about $9.5 billion. The company also said on Friday it would put off construction of a cargo terminal in Hong Kong and would ask its cabin crews to take unpaid leave to cut costs as demand shrinks. The airline, based in Hong Kong, has orders for about 35 Boeing planes and was expected to take delivery of around 10 each year in 2009, 2010 and 2011. Cathay’s decision is a minor blow for Boeing, which has a backlog of orders for 3,734 planes. But it could be a sign that more airlines in Asia, an increasingly important region for the plane maker, could push back deliveries or even cancel orders. Boeing is already delaying deliveries of all its commercial jets by at least two months after the 58-day strike by its machinists.1039 2008-11-29 She and her husband never felt that they were getting into debt, Ms. Jones said, because a kind of magical thinking prevailed: “You owed more, but then your house was worth more,” she said. “So you didn’t really have debt because you could always sell your house — and poof! — all previous sins would be erased.”For years, the Joneses sensed that something was wrong. Their expenses kept spiraling out of control and their checking account was chronically overdrawn. But as the economy began to tremble — and the couple realized that they wanted to right their finances before their 11-year-old daughter entered college — they decided to change course. “There was this constant, underlying anxiety about money,” Ms. Jones said. “It was ridiculous — I knew we should be able to live on what we were earning.”But switching to a lifestyle based on your actual income is more challenging than it seems, especially if you’ve been relying on credit as an income supplement. The maxim to “tighten your belt” implies that self-discipline is the solution, but our financial brains aren’t so easily tamed.Many people rely on a quirky system of mental accounting when making financial choices, according to economists who study spending. If you saved $30 when buying a sweater, for example, you might talk yourself into buying shoes, with the rationale that you have an extra $30.The use of credit tends to make people’s financial reasoning even more flawed, according to Dilip Soman, a professor of marketing at the Rotman School of Management, University of Toronto. “I find that people who are used to paying for expenses by credit card tend to create an ad hoc ‘credit card bill’ mental account,” Professor Soman said in an e-mail message.“If the credit account vanishes, people are now forced to make cuts into their lifestyle, because their budgeted spending money supply has now shrunk,” he said, even though that supply shouldn’t have been included in their accounting from the start.MS. JONES said that to get back to living on their actual incomes, she and her husband had to stop thinking in terms of credit. They set up one bank account to cover the household bills and pay back debt. To rein in unnecessary expenditures, she and her husband each get a cash allowance of $600 a month.By living on cash, Ms. Jones said, they can still buy what they want — dinners out, clothes, gadgets like the turkey fryer she just picked up at Costco — but once the money is gone, that’s it.It’s working so far, she said, and the unexpected payoff is peace of mind. “There’s so much anxiety, when you’re adding to this huge mountain of debt,” she said. “We should be living off what we make, not what we’re going to make later.”1040 2008-11-29 EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) — Giants wide receiver Plaxico Burress will miss Sunday’s game against Washington with a sore right hamstring.Burress pulled his hamstring in the Giants’ win over Baltimore on Nov. 16. He aggravated the injury in the opening series last Sunday against Arizona and sat out the rest of that game.Giants Coach Tom Coughlin said Friday that Burress was “progressing, no doubt; he is getting better.”Domenik Hixon, who has an ankle injury, will start in Burress’s place.The last time Burress missed a game was Nov. 5, 2006, when he sat out with a back injury. He played in every game for the Super Bowl champion Giants last season despite a persistent ankle injury.Linebacker Jonathan Goff (hamstring) will also not play Sunday, and three players — running backs Brandon Jacobs (knee) and Ahmad Bradshaw (neck) and defensive tackle Fred Robbins (shoulder) — are listed as questionable. Coughlin said that Jacobs practiced Friday but that Bradshaw and Robbins could not.Hixon and defensive ends Justin Tuck (lower leg) and Jerome McDougle (knee) all practiced fully Friday. They are probable for Sunday’s game.1041 2008-11-29 Officials in Washington said Friday that there was no evidence that the Pakistani government had any role in the attacks. But if evidence were to emerge that the operation had been planned and directed from within Pakistan, that would certainly further escalate tensions between India and Pakistan, bitter, nuclear-armed rivals. It could also provoke an Indian military response, even strikes against militants’ training camps.American and Indian officials were pursuing the possibility that the attackers arrived off the coast of Mumbai in a large ship and then boarded smaller boats before initiating their attack.An American counterterrorism official said there was strong evidence that Lashkar-e-Taiba had a “maritime capability” and would have been able to mount the sophisticated operation in Mumbai.Senior Bush administration officials sought to keep the tensions from boiling over on Friday by maintaining steady contact with Indian officials. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice spoke by phone with Pranab Mukherjee, India’s foreign minister, and one of Ms. Rice’s deputies spoke with the Indian foreign secretary.In what was seen as a sign of Pakistan’s concern about a possible Indian response, Pakistani officials announced Friday that the head of the I.S.I. would go to India to help the Indian government with its investigation. On Friday evening, however, Pakistani officials indicated that a lower-level I.S.I. representative might make the trip.American and Indian officials have for years blamed Lashkar-e-Taiba for a campaign of violence against high-profile targets throughout India, including the December 2001 attack on the Indian Parliament building in New Delhi and an August 2007 strike at an amusement park in Hyderabad. At times, Indian officials have also said Jaish-e-Muhammad was responsible for the attack on Parliament.That attack prompted the Bush administration to try to freeze Lashkar-e-Taiba’s assets and press Gen. Pervez Musharraf, Pakistan’s president at the time, to crack down on the group’s training operations in Pakistan.A State Department report released this year called Lashkar-e-Taiba “one of the largest and most proficient of the Kashmiri-focused militant groups.” The report said that the group drew financing in part from Pakistani expatriates in the Middle East, and that it used a front organization called Jamaat ud-Daawa to coordinate charitable activities, like relief for the victims of the October 2006 earthquake in Kashmir.The report said the actual size of the group was unknown, but estimated it at “several thousand” members.Recently, some of the group’s operations have shifted from Kashmir to Pakistan’s Federally Administered Tribal Areas and even to Afghanistan to attack American troops. American officials and terrorism experts said the group had not sent large numbers of operatives into Afghanistan, but had embedded small teams with Taliban units to gain fighting experience.“Afghanistan is an operating war zone, so they can get active training as the Kashmir front has slowed down a bit,” said Seth Jones, a terrorism expert at the RAND Corporation.The group is believed by experts to have at least a loose affiliation with Al Qaeda. In March 2002, a Qaeda lieutenant, Abu Zubaydah, was captured in a Lashkar-e-Taiba safe house in Faisalabad, Pakistan, according to the State Department report.Lashkar-e-Taiba is not known to have singled out Westerners in past terrorist attacks, as the gunmen in Mumbai seem to have done. But one counterterrorism official said Friday that the group “has not pursued an exclusively Kashmiri agenda” and that it might certainly go after Westerners to advance broader goals.Even as a Kashmiri connection to the attacks began to emerge on Friday, American officials said they were puzzled by some developments. For instance, they said they knew next to nothing about a group called the Deccan Mujahedeen, which issued a claim of responsibility for the attacks.Terrorism experts have said there is no evidence of that group’s involvement in past strikes, and they speculated that another group fabricated the name to mask responsibility.1042 2008-11-29 Wall Street finished higher Friday, wrapping up its biggest five-day rally in more than 75 years, even as investors digested signs of a bleak holiday season for retailers.During the short trading day, investors turned to blue-chip names like Citigroup and General Motors, fueling a rally that surprised many market experts.Just last week, the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index fell to its lowest point since 1997 while Citigroup and G.M. were also severely beaten down — touching off worries about how far the market would slide.While the stock market’s strong rebound was certainly welcome, analysts weren’t getting too optimistic. Not only were trading volumes very light on Friday, but investors also will be digesting several reports on the state of the economy next week, including a reading on the manufacturing sector and the employment report from the Labor Department. Both are expected to be dismal.“We’re seeing some confidence come back into this stock market, but I don’t think that’s necessarily a reason to be dropping our guard,” said Scott Fullman, director of derivatives investment strategy for WJB Capital Group in New York. “You still have to be cautious. There’s opportunity, but you have to be extremely selective and defensive.”1043 2008-11-30 Mississippi State Coach Sylvester Croom has resigned after five years at the college. He was the first black head football coach in the Southeastern Conference. Croom resigned a day after 45-0 loss to No. 25 Mississippi in a rivalry game. Croom led the Bulldogs to an 8-5 finish and the Liberty Bowl in 2007. But the team struggled a year later, finishing 4-8. Croom went 21-38 overall.¶Miami of Ohio Coach Shane Montgomery has resigned after a 2-10 season. Athletic Director Brad Bates announced the resignation, saying the team had not achieved an expected level of success. Miami was 17-31 during Montgomery’s four seasons as coach. mo (AP)1044 2008-11-30 Seven years after a raging fire destroyed its north transept and crippled its organ, the Cathedral Church of St. John the Divine was rededicated in a service attended by religious leaders, political leaders and thousands of New Yorkers....1045 2008-11-30 We want to know how you think Barack Obama -- and the nation -- should celebrate the Inauguration....1046 2008-11-30 Croom resigned in the wake of a 45-0 loss to Mississippi State’s archrival, Mississippi, in the Egg Bowl on Friday; the Bulldogs ended the year 4-8.He finished with a 21-38 record. He took over a program saddled by N.C.A.A. sanctions and led it last year to its first winning season since 2000. The Bulldogs beat Central Florida in the Liberty Bowl last season.But this season started with a loss to Louisiana Tech, and the Bulldogs never recovered. Croom stressed that he was not forced to resign.“We have tried to build a program the right way that can compete for conference championships,” Croom said in a statement. “I believe the foundation has been set for those goals to be reached under the leadership of someone else, and it was my decision to resign.”Seven of the 32 coaches in the N.F.L. are African-American. Keith said that progress had been made in the N.F.L. because of the Rooney Rule, which required teams to interview minority candidates for coaching vacancies. There is also less bureaucracy than in college football, Keith said.“You’ve got so many bridges to cross in college,” Keith said. “In the N.F.L., there’s two, the owner and the general manager. In college there’s the president, athletic director, search committee, search group that runs the high-profile searches, and significant others of influence, whether it be political or financial. The college thing is much more complex.”Keith said the disparity between the percentage of African-American players — about 50 percent — and that of African-American head coaches was staggering.He said he hoped the election of Barack Obama would open minds. But with numbers decreasing, he said, there should be more outrage.“I don’t know how long we’re going to keep tolerating it,” he said. “It’s ridiculous.”1047 2008-11-30 Headlines from the world of property: U.S.: Sand castles-half-price mansions From Malibu to Manhattan, would-be buyers of $5 million-and-up properties are pulling out of pending deals, sending prices plummeting.

The picture the writer, Anand Giridharadas, paints of India leaves the other half of the story out of the canvas.As first-generation Indian immigrants, my wife and I would much like to share the same dreams of seeing our future generations settle back in the country we left behind and still cherish. But the reason neither we nor our children take the step is not that India can’t offer first-world features, ones that were absent when we left two decades ago, but rather because of the features that have now disappeared.Economic liberalization, a rampantly Westernized pleasure-driven social model and a radical departure from an ethics-based lifestyle have all contributed to create a country that we don’t seem to relate to anymore. India in just 20-some years has digressed from a communal to an individualized concept of life, degenerating its newer generations into no-consequence lifestyles, followed by a total disregard for its treasured history and traditions, and neglect of its underprivileged.When we left for America, we didn’t know our new country. Now we can’t go back to the old country we knew so well. In today’s globalized society, that’s the true immigrant paradox.1050 2008-11-30 A picture caption last Sunday with an article about the abundance of new films on the Holocaust misspelled the surname of an actor in “Life Is Beautiful,” who was also the director and co-writer of the film. He is Roberto Benigni, not Begnini.1051 2008-11-30 Texas Tech announced last month that an N.C.A.A. report showed its football team had a graduation rate of 79 percent to lead the Big 12. The N.C.A.A. report showed the football rate for Texas at 50 percent and Oklahoma at 46 percent — at the bottom of the Big 12.Baylor (4-8, 2-6) scored on its opening possession of the second half with Jacoby Jones capping a 78-yard drive on a 1-yard touchdown run to lead by 28-14.Texas Tech (11-1, 7-1) took control from there — without the all-American receiver Michael Crabtree, who left with a right foot injury midway through the second quarter and did not return.In Kansas City, Mo., Todd Reesing threw a 26-yard touchdown pass to the backup quarterback Kerry Meier with 27 seconds left, helping Kansas rally for a second time in the fourth quarter to beat Missouri, 40-37. The Tigers had already secured a return trip to the conference title game.The Jayhawks (7-5, 4-4) led by 16 early in the third quarter, let Missouri back in it, then traded touchdowns with the Tigers (9-3, 5-3) in the fourth quarter before Reesing hit Meier on fourth-and-7.The Atlantic Coast Conference expanded four years ago in order to add a lucrative football title game. For the second straight year, Boston College and Virginia Tech — teams that joined the conference during that expansion — will play in the league title game.¶In Boston, Billy Flutie, the backup quarterback and a nephew of Doug Flutie, threw a 9-yard touchdown pass on a fake field-goal attempt to lead No. 20 Boston College to a 28-21 victory over Maryland.B.C.

He was fired Nov. 16.Fans hurled oranges onto the field after every score, despite warnings over the public-address system. Another barrage hit the field as the clock ran out.1052 2008-11-30 He was an infant when he arrived. In fact, he was born in a refugee camp in Thailand and had never seen Cambodia before he was deported. But K.K.’s parents were simple farmers who failed to complete the citizenship process when they arrived.Like some children of poor immigrants, K.K. drifted to the streets, where he became a member of the Crips gang and a champion break dancer. It was only after he was convicted of armed robbery at 18 that he discovered that he was not a citizen.Like many deportees, he arrived in Cambodia without possessions and without family contacts. He was a drug counselor at first and then founded his break dancing club, Tiny Toones Cambodia, where he now earns a living teaching about 150 youngsters and reaching out to hundreds more.With the financial support of international aid groups like Bridges Across Borders, based in Graham, Fla., he has expanded his center into a small school that teaches English and Khmer and computers in addition to back flips, head stands and krumping, or crazy dancing.Some other deportees have found work that uses their fluency in English, particularly in hotels. Some have reunited with families. But many have slipped into unemployment, depression and sometimes drug use.“Some were doing well initially but now over time have become unemployed or never did get employment, and just got discouraged,” said Dimple Rana, who works with Deported Diaspora, which is based in Revere, Mass., and helps deportees adjust.“I know of a whole bunch of returnees whose mothers were sending money from their Social Security,” she said. “Now, with the economy in the United States, it is very hard and families are not able to send even $100 or $150.”K.K. stands out as a success, both in finding a calling and in embracing his fate. He has a fair command of the language, unlike some deportees who arrived with no knowledge of Khmer.“I think it was meant for me to be here, even though I lost my family,” he said. “And my kid is there, Kayshawn. He is 8.”K.K. is in touch with his relatives in Long Beach but has not seen them since he was deported.“Right now, you know, these kids are my family,” he said. “I don’t have a kid here, but I adopted one, a street kid. His mom and dad are on drugs.”The boys and girls leaping and spinning here are the children of Cambodia’s underclass, like thousands who fill the slums of Phnom Penh — children who spend their evenings, as K.K. put it, “begging and digging through garbage to find food.”K.K., whose youth was not so different from theirs, said he teaches them to find pride in who they are. A wall of his center is marked with students’ graffiti: “I want to be a rapper,” “I want to be a D.J.,” “I want to be a doctor.”“I try to tell them not to judge people by the way they look,” he said. “I still have a struggle here in Cambodia. People judge me. People see me with tattoos and think I’m a bad guy.“Sometimes it’s, ‘Come on, we’re going to kill some Americans,’ ” he said, describing threats from street toughs. “I’m not American. I’m Khmer, man.”His journey between identities reached a point of strangeness when he was invited last December to perform with some of his students at a Christmas party at the United States Embassy.“The American ambassador gave me a handshake and a hug, and asked me one day when his kid is a little older he wanted to put him in my school,” K.K. said.The ambassador at the time, Joseph A. Mussomeli, recalled the performance as “great fun,” but he said the piquancy of the moment had not been lost on him.“You are right that there is a certain wonderful irony to him being ‘rejected’ or at least ‘ejected’ from the U.S. and still landing on his feet — or shoulders and head — dancing,” Mr. Mussomeli said in an e-mail message.“While watching him I was reminded of that great patriotic speech by Bill Murray in ‘Stripes,’ ” he added, “where he talks about Americans as being rejects from all the good, decent countries of the world! K.K. is/was an American in everything except in law — and he has shown this by his creativity, tenacity, and undying optimism.”Now another irony is in store for K.K. His club has been invited to send dancers to perform in the United States — Cambodian boys who speak no English and have never left their country.The real American among them, K.K., deported and excluded from the United States for the rest of his life, must stay behind.“I can’t go,” he said over the thump of the boom box, as his boys jumped and bounced around him like tiny springs. “I can understand that they deported me here. I’d like to go visit — only visit, because I live here now. I have a brand new life.”1053 2008-11-30 The expense comes as the city announced $130 million in budget cuts this month to deal with a revenue shortfall caused by the larger economic slowdown.Most of the inauguration is financed by private donations and federal money, but the city takes on a range of responsibilities.While the Secret Service will oversee security, including the sharpshooters, air patrols and monitoring of the city’s 5,000 or so surveillance cameras, most of the city’s 4,100 police officers will help direct traffic, operate metal detectors and escort dignitaries. An additional 4,000 officers from surrounding states have been called in to bolster the city’s force. It was unclear who would pay for them.The city will also be responsible for providing more than 1,200 first responders to handle medical emergencies and several hundred sanitation workers to clean up after the festivities.“If we get snow, things could get even more expensive,” said Dan Tangherlini, the city administrator, pointing out that in 1961, inauguration planners called out 700 troops with shovels and flamethrowers after an unexpected storm blanketed the city in eight inches of snow before John F. Kennedy’s ceremony. To clear the snow from the inauguration parade route can cost the city more than $1 million alone, Mr. Tangherlini said.Ms. Norton said she was trying to get an additional $15 million allocated to the city, since the $15 million already set aside was supposed to cover the cost of policing all large events throughout the year.“If we spend all these funds on the inauguration,” she said, “how is the city is going to pay for events like the Fourth of July celebration and the antiwar marches that happen every year and are federal in focus?”Despite such concerns, local businesses are expecting big benefits.Restaurants throughout the city and hotels as far away as West Virginia are booked. The Metro transit system is charging $10 for commemorative tickets bearing Mr. Obama’s picture. City residents have been posting advertisements on the Internet offering rooms in their homes for $500 a night. Others have even offered parking for a camping vehicle in their driveway for $80 a night, or tent space in their garden with access to toilet and shower facilities for $100 a night.The city and surrounding area have about 95,000 hotel rooms, which are quickly filling up and being priced at two to three times the normal rate.But the region’s housing and transit systems may be stretched to capacity.While some federal officials are predicting crowds of 1.5 million people, Mayor Adrian M. Fenty of Washington has said the number could be as high as 3 million, breaking the record of 1.2 million who attended Lyndon B. Johnson’s inauguration, in 1965.The city is planning to run double the usual number of subway trains and buses. Eighteen Washington-bound trains on the Northeast Corridor are already sold out for the long weekend, and Amtrak is monitoring whether to add more trains to the schedule, said Cliff Black, a spokesman for Amtrak. Virginia Railway Express and Maryland’s commuter trains typically do not run on federal holidays but will do so for the inauguration, city officials said.Because of limited hotel space and limited budgets, many charter services are running “there-and-back” or “turnaround” specials. These buses will roll out the evening of Jan. 19, arrive in Washington the morning of the swearing-in and depart later that day.Some city officials worry that there is not enough room to handle the crowds, and they have been pushing for more space.Officials from the National Park Service said they planned to open more areas than in past years along the Pennsylvania Avenue parade route.A spokeswoman from the mayor’s office said it had lobbied for National Park Service officials to open large sections of the Mall east of the Washington Monument, a space normally used for staging the many components of the inaugural parade. That would make the Mall a viewing area that experts said could accommodate several million people — significantly more than in the past.It is not clear, though, if there will be enough indoor space for older people who cannot stand outdoors in frigid January cold.“There are so many people from around the country, especially older folks, who are saying this is the one thing they thought they would never see in their lifetime,” Ms. Norton said, “and so now they’re saying they are not going to miss it for the world.”Older people may not realize they will have to walk long distances, she said, because, for security reasons, trains and buses will not be able to carry passengers all the way to the event site.As an alternative, city officials and Ms. Norton have been pushing for inauguration planners to use arenas and stadiums to help with overflow crowds wanting to view the ceremonies on big-screen televisions. They are also urging churches to hold viewing parties.“But renting these facilities costs money too,” Ms. Norton said, “and so far it’s not budgeted.”1054 2008-11-30 He struggled to start at Anfield and in 2000 joined Blackburn, where he spent eight years before joining Villa. His backup at Villa is another American, Brad Guzan, and the club is owned by Randy Lerner, who also owns the N.F.L.’s Cleveland Browns.“It is remarkable in this day and age, whether you are a keeper or not, to play that number of games consecutively,” Villa’s Manager, Martin O’Neill, said. “It is fantastic. Well done to him. During the last eight or nine years, from leaving Liverpool to the career he has had at Blackburn, Brad Friedel has been so consistent.”Friedel also played 82 games for the United States from 1992-2004, but has retired from international play.HOFFENHEIM STAYS ON TOP Hoffenheim stayed in first place in the German Bundesliga after a 3-0 victory at home Saturday against Arminia Bielefeld, but Bayern Munich stayed close with a 2-0 win at Bayer Leverkusen.Vedad Ibisevic, the league’s leading scorer and a former star and St. Louis University, scored his 17th of the season, and his teammate Carlos Eduardo scored in the first 11 minutes.Hoffenheim has 11 league victories and 34 points in 15 games.Bayern is second, three points back, after Luca Toni and Miroslav Klose scored in the second half.Hoffenheim, from a small village in southwest Germany, has won promotion up the league ladder in consecutive seasons, backed by the multimillionaire Dietmar Hopp. Ivisevic, a native of Bosnia, spent his teenage years in St. Louis, where his family settled under a United Nations program.(AGENCE FRANCE-PRESSE)THREE ADVANCE IN N.C.A.A.

His father is the editorial page editor of The Rutland Herald in Rutland, Vt., and won a Pulitzer Prize in 2001 for his editorials on civil unions for same-sex couples in the state.1057 2008-11-30 INVESTORS with the fortitude to buy stocks these days may want to consider the small-cap value category.Of course, there’s no guarantee that such stocks, already hurt in the market’s decline, won’t keep losing money. And there’s no assurance that the lessons of the past even apply to the current market, which in so many ways seems to be marching to its own beat.Yet historical precedents suggest that the small-cap value sector deserves serious attention. At least over the last four decades, these stocks have tended to produce their most explosive gains right at the start of a bull market. And during declines, they have tended to lose less than the broad market averages.Together, these two factors may make it worth the risk to jump the gun in order not to be too late.Value stocks are those whose prices are lowest relative to their intrinsic value. Though advisers use more than one metric to define a value stock, the definition used by Eugene F. Fama, a finance professor at the University of Chicago, and Kenneth R. French, a finance professor at Dartmouth, is perhaps the most widely cited. They put into the value category about one-third of all stocks: those with the smallest price-to-book ratios. According to the professors, these stocks beat the overall market by 4.9 percentage points a year, on average, from mid-1963 through October of this year, the most recent date for which data are available.The approximately 75 percent of value stocks with the smallest market capitalizations fared even better, according to the professors. They calculate that these stocks outperformed the broad market by an average of 6.4 percentage points a year from mid-1963 through October.1058 2008-11-30 THE customer, when first stepping down from East 86th Street into the entrance of M. Rohrs, tea and coffee purveyor, might well feel right at home.On the ground floor of a brownstone between First and Second Avenues, this scruffy, sprawling coffeehouse, the sixth incarnation of an 1896 original, plays host to those seeking a downtown feel uptown. They often bring computers and, seated at tables or worn couches, engage in study or quiet conversation.But then their laptops run out of juice, and they look around for a place to plug in, and the homey feel fades a bit. That’s because an hour of outlet time goes for $3 at M. Rohrs, and up to five hours goes for $5.“Theft of a public utility is prohibited,” sternly warn notices that are posted near outlets.“It’s a little in your face,” said Scott Saverance, a 35-year-old software developer who lives nearby. In front of him, where he sat, were a laptop, a cellphone and a Blackberry. “It’s a necessity, I suppose,” he added. “I often wonder how a shop like this makes money, but you do have to ask yourself how these things present themselves to the clientele.”Many cafes and coffee shops around the city charge for wireless connections, but rare is the charge for electricity. Starbucks, for example, tends to view outlets as part of the deal. Even shops that do not, like the Barnes & Noble at Broadway and West 82nd Street, simply do not offer outlets to cafegoers rather than charge them for power.1059 2008-11-30 The group ride, referred to as a bike pool, takes place monthly, and for the cyclists who participate, it’s part commute home, part political statement. As bike lanes sprout up all around the city, these cyclists are urging the installation of a protected bike lane with a barrier from vehicular traffic on this most notorious of boulevards.Queens politicians like Councilman James Gennaro have supported the call for some kind of bike lane, and a spokesman for Mr. Gennaro said the boulevard could accommodate one with minimal effect on the flow of traffic.The recent push for a bike lane began after Asif Rahman, a 22-year-old cyclist, was killed in February by a truck near 55th Road. Mr. Rahman, described by his mother as “so full of life,” was a photographer, a poet and an aspiring hip-hop artist with the stage name “The Metaphysical Lyrical Wizard.” Despite the boulevard’s dangers, Mr. Norvell said, cyclists use it because it is the fastest and most direct route from many Queens neighborhoods to the bridge.Nicole Garcia, a spokeswoman for the Transportation Department, said, “Safety is our top priority as we build on the safety enhancements we’ve made along Queens Boulevard and throughout the city, which have led to a dramatic decrease in accidents.” As for a bike lane on the boulevard, Ms. Garcia said, there are no current plans for one. The high number of pedestrians and the heavy traffic, she said, present challenges for building a bike lane there.Enid Rivera, 49, used to bike along the boulevard from her home in Jamaica to her job in Midtown as a graphic designer for The Daily News. In 2005, however, she was struck by a hit-and-run driver and seriously injured.“I still have the helmet with the dried blood on it,” she said.Ms. Rivera still commutes on her bike, but now, she said, she takes the back streets.Dave Kolick, 56, a Flushing resident whose bike sports pink neon lights, said he cycles a few times each week to his job near South Street Seaport as a computer programmer. He usually opts for more serene streets, though riding on Queens Boulevard, he estimated, would shave about a mile and half off his trip.“I would love to take it,” Mr. Kolick said of the boulevard. “But the idea is to avoid getting hit.”On that recent Friday, the 20-some cyclists, whistling and jingling their bicycle bells to announce their departure, headed to 43rd Avenue, where, for a stretch in Sunnyside, a bike lane runs parallel to Queens Boulevard.Most of the cyclists wore orange reflector vests that read, “Share the Road” across the backs. But sharing sometimes proved difficult.“Move over, move over,” yelled a woman in the passenger seat of a black sedan that zipped past the cyclists.The cyclists merged onto Queens Boulevard at 50th Street, where a service lane begins and offers somewhat of a buffer against the traffic. There, they breezed over the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway, passed a stretch of used-car dealerships and finished the group ride outside a diner in Elmhurst, where some broke off to eat and others continued on, passing the Queens Center Mall.At least some of the drivers on Queens Boulevard think a bike lane would make the congested road worse.On a sunny Sunday afternoon, Alex Vasiliev, a 66-year-old livery cab driver from Ukraine, stood near his car parked near the Queensboro Bridge.“Bicycles need a lane,” he said. He then grinned and added, “But cars do not need bicycle lane.”Congestion has posed challenges on Queens Boulevard ever since its beginnings in the early 1900s. An early plan called for a far narrower roadway, but that plan was scrapped because of “rapidly increasing vehicular traffic,” in the words of Maurice Connolly, then the borough president. He had high hopes for the boulevard that would decades later become infamous.“Queens Boulevard is destined to be the finest avenue in the world,” Mr. Connolly said in announcing plans for the wider road. He was mindful of places like the Avenue des Champs-Elysées in Paris, he said. But, with its vast size, he believed that Queens Boulevard “will far surpass” them.1060 2008-11-30 “I just wanted it to be easy,” Mr. Lacinski said. “I thought that the cachet of the building would bring in potential buyers who would be able to look past our design sense.”In the spring of 2008, with the market cooling and no offers, the couple lowered the asking price to $975,000. That drew a buyer — who subsequently backed out. By this time, their property had been on the market for six months, and Mr. Lacinski and Mr. Pagoota were starting to get nervous. When their listing expired, they decided not to renew.“We wanted to rethink our strategy,” Mr. Pagoota said. “We figured we should get a broker who specialized in selling in London Terrace.”They went with Susan Singer and Joseph Bongiovanni, brokers with the Corcoran Group. Ms. Singer, who lives in London Terrace Towers, knew their building well. “No matter how wonderful the building, there are cheaper ones out there,” she said. “You have to price aggressively, and your presentation is key.”The brokers had some basic redecorating in mind. “My immediate thoughts were that they needed to paint and to remove as much of their art collection as possible,” Mr. Bongiovanni said. “It’s not that their blue living room was unattractive, but people react strongly to colors and the same goes for art.” He recommended neutral tones to appeal to the widest demographic.Mr. Lacinski and Mr. Pagoota removed about one-third of their furnishings, including curtains, rugs and books, and most of their paintings and sculptures. They stored everything at their second home in East Hampton, N.Y.On their brokers’ recommendation, they hired Inigo Design and Build of Maplewood, N.J., to paint the place white and restore a worn portion of the hardwood floor. This cost about $1,800.“It was like an extreme home-makeover TV show, only there was no crying at the end,” Mr. Lacinski said, referring to a reality show in which homeowners are often crying with joy when the credits roll. “We really liked how it all turned out. Our place felt 10 times bigger.”The finishing touches included a copy of French Vogue on the coffee table — a nod, perhaps, to potential international buyers. “People might laugh at this,” Mr. Bongiovanni said, “but I wanted the apartment to feel glamorous.”Based on recent sales in the building and similar apartments on the market, Ms. Singer and Mr. Bongiovanni suggested a list price of $935,000. The apartment went back on the market in May.Open houses drew in a steady stream of prospects, including residents of London Terrace with ambitions of trading up. Among them were Morgan Mulford and Doug Palumbo, who had bought an alcove studio apartment there in 2001. “We really wish we got a one-bedroom back then,” Mr. Mulford said.But the men thought the one-bedroom in question was expensive. They are crossing their fingers that 2009 brings a softening of prices, even in London Terrace. “That’s what we are secretly hoping,” Mr. Mulford said.Luis Gonzales had seen about 10 apartments before he visited the Lacinski-Pagoota apartment in June. “Once I saw it, I knew I had to have it,” said Mr. Gonzales, an architect.“The apartment has great light,” he said, noting its west- and north-facing exposures. “I spent the last 12 years living near Wall Street, and it’s a lot darker down there.” He liked the architectural details, he added, especially the casings around the doors and the closets that were stripped down to bare metal.“The apartment and the building have a lot of unique charm,” he said. “But once I saw the pool, forget it. I really wanted to live there.” The building complex has a 75-foot-by-35-foot indoor swimming pool open to residents.After a few days of negotiating, Mr. Lacinski and Mr. Pagoota agreed to sell for $908,000. The deal closed in October.“We would have loved a price over $950,000, but the market is changing,” Mr. Lacinski said.“We are happy to have sold,” Mr. Pagoota added. “It’s a relief to know we are not stuck because we can’t sell.”The couple are renting a two-bedroom in Archstone Clinton South, a new building in Hell’s Kitchen, and watching to see what the market does. “Ideally, I think we’ll buy new construction in Chelsea,” Mr. Lacinski said.Mr. Gonzales has explored the neighborhood’s art galleries, but he says he has been too busy to take a plunge in the building’s pool.“I’ll get in there soon,” he promised.1061 2008-11-30 Towns typically meet these kinds of obligations by hinging their approval of new developments on the applicants’ promises either to bankroll or build a certain quantity of “affordable” housing. Under the program, towns get four extra credits for each unit created for residents with special needs.In the past, towns were able to meet their affordable-unit quota by taking part in a regional agreement that permitted the trading of credits between municipalities. The recent changes eliminated this option, explained Mr. Vallone, a developer with a company called Hoboken Brownstone, and now each town must meet its own obligations.Fair-housing laws have always prohibited discrimination against home buyers, he added, “so now there is an open path in any municipality where a group home is needed.”Another revision to the regulations set the average cost per unit of affordable housing at $160,000. Previously, Mr. Vallone said, the amount a developer would contribute to affordable housing was negotiated, and ordinarily fell well below that figure.All three of the new Our House group homes are being created as a result of collaborations with town officials to obtain the money to buy, update and retrofit houses so that they are handicapped-accessible, Mr. Vallone said.In West Orange, where Prism Capital Partners is at work on a large-scale mixed-use redevelopment project, Mayor John F. McKeon brought Prism together with Our House. The developer paid $200,000 toward creation of the group home, and the town earned four affordable-housing credits.Berkeley Heights has an Affordable Housing Trust Fund, which developers have paid into, and which dispenses money to nonprofit groups like Our House. It contributed $350,000 toward purchase of the two new houses.The Berkeley Heights mayor, David A. Cohen, worked with Our House to assure that it could afford the purchases after the agency explained that it needed to provide more suitable homes for a group of men already living in the community, Mr. Vallone said.“He understood that we were trying to assist developmentally disabled men, who are getting older, and who were living in a cramped two-story house, where the stairs were becoming a problem,” he said.The two houses in Berkeley Heights will be the new homes of six men, all with mental disabilities — some congenital, others a result of traumatic brain injury. They have all lived for many years in a small three-bedroom house, opened as an Our House group home 27 years ago. One of the men has lived there the entire 27 years, Ms. Wernsing said.“We did an assessment several years ago, and determined the average age of our residents is 50,” she said, “and began to face the reality that when someone moves in with us at age 20 or 25, they’re going to be with us the rest of their lives.”Dr. Richard V. Olsen, a professor of environmental psychology at the New Jersey Institute of Technology and a member of the Our House board, outlined the real estate requirements of older people with disabilities: “a ranch house on a level lot, since wheelchairs might become a necessity; abundant natural light to accommodate aging eyes; easy flow between the rooms; and wide aisles and door frames.”Another board member, Peter Wisniewski, who is a commercial real estate broker with the David Cronheim Company in Chatham, searched the residential listings for houses that fit the bill and brokered the purchases.Mr. Vallone hired an architect familiar with special-needs design to devise plans for rehabbing the structures, and a construction crew to do the renovations.The work proceeds apace this fall. The five-bedroom house, for example, has been converted to have four large bedrooms, and has been given two new baths, new skylights, a new deck and wider hallways. Ramps are about to be installed, and then some floors will be refinished or recarpeted with nonskid material.The men who will be benefiting from all these efforts haven’t been told about them yet, at the request of families and aides. “They will hear about it, and start coming to see the new place, about six weeks before they move,” Ms. Wernsing said. “That seems to be the right amount of time — not too long, and not too short a time for them to adjust.”Our House provides both support and employment services. Some residents of its group homes — who may also receive state-financed services or take part in state-financed programs — work part time.The group, which operates group homes and supported-living apartments in four counties — Essex, Morris, Somerset and Union — was founded in 1980 by a Summit woman, Patricia Shillingburg, whose developmentally disabled child had turned 18 and “aged out” of existing support programs. It is financed through grants, donations, bequests and fund-raising events, including an annual 10-kilometer run in Summit.1062 2008-11-30 The New Year’s Eve dinner party in question has since gone down in our family annals as the Night of the Great Spelt Screw-Up. We were making, or intending to make, farro, an ancient wheat variety that can be cooked risotto-style with broth, butter and Parmesan. Unfortunately there was no farro to be found at the nearby Whole Foods. Blinded by a flash of substitution brilliance, I bought two pounds of spelt from the dry-goods aisle, recalling that I’d heard somewhere that farro was the fancy Italian word for the far-less-fancy-sounding “spelt.”Spelt, to my eye, didn’t look like farro, and from a stovetop behavioral standpoint, it quickly distinguished itself. In a panic I called my personal farro expert, Jennifer DeVore, explaining I couldn’t find farro so instead I bought. . . . “Oh, no,” she interrupted. “You didn’t buy spelt.” Farro cooks in about 45 minutes; we cooked our spelt for four hours, and even then the result was extremely al dente. We threw in multiple sticks of butter, gallons of stock and $13 worth of grated Parmesan, but the spelt remained stoically flavor-impervious. We served it anyway. Contrary to the claims of Hildegard von Bingen, a 12th-century spelt enthusiast, our guests did not find that eating it “makes the spirit of man light and cheerful.”Mocked for my farro-equals-spelt assumption, I tried to exonerate myself by proving just how widespread is this misperception. Google “farro (spelt),” and you’ll get 2,100 hits, many for recipes that claim the grains can be used interchangeably. Even my family’s cookbook hero, Suzanne Goin, makes this claim in “Sunday Suppers at Lucques”: “Farro, also known as spelt, is probably my all-time favorite grain.” She cooks hers simply, in parsley and butter, or bulks it up with kabocha squash and cavolo nero. Farro is also wonderful in soups, like the hearty farro-and-kale soup in Sara Jenkins and Mindy Fox’s new cookbook, “Olives & Oranges.” (It’s clearly gaining ground. Recently, 2 of the 17 contestants on “Top Chef” offered dishes containing farro.) But Harold McGee, in “On Food and Cooking,” clarifies that farro is the Italian word for emmer wheat; of spelt, which he calls “remarkable” for its high protein content, he says, “Often confused with emmer (farro).”So there you have it from me and McGee: farro is not spelt. Which still raises the question, How do you eat spelt if the whole-grain version so severely cramps a man’s body and spirit? Whole spelt berries are used (judiciously) as a healthful textural addition to muffins, stuffings and salads. Ground spelt is a popular substitute for wheat flour because of its lower gluten content; although spelt is a type of wheat, some people who suffer from wheat sensitivity can digest it. (Because spelt does contain some gluten, however, those with celiac disease cannot eat it.)If you have encountered spelt, it has most likely been in the spiritually uninspiring form of those cellophane-wrapped, beige bread products, sold in health-food stores, that taste like wet cardboard. Artisanal bread baked with intensely nutty-tasting whole-grain spelt flour, as is done by Tim Semler and Lydia Moffet of Tinder Hearth Bakery in Brooksville, Me., is much less of a spiritual buzz kill. Baking with whole-grain spelt flour, however, requires commitment; given spelt’s low gluten content, the dough fails to “stand up” like wheat dough, meaning Semler and Moffet have had to experiment with a “high hydration” technique, resulting in a fermented, batterlike dough that must be baked in a pan. The end product, while loaf-shaped, is, when compared with its wheat-flour counterparts, a denser, wetter bread with a tougher crust. The Tinder Hearth loaf has spawned a cult of addicts, of which I am now one. (Moffet also uses whole-grain spelt flour to make pancakes. She insists that they give you a lot more energy and that “you can eat a bunch of them and not feel like you’re going to die.”)At the Hungry Ghost bakery in Northampton, Mass., run by Jonathan Stevens and Cheryl Maffei, Stevens uses white spelt flour for his bread, that is, whole-grain flour that has been sifted to remove the ground bits of bran, which, Stevens says, act like “glass shards,” slicing the gluten strands and further impeding the standing-up process. “I’ve tried to make friends with whole spelt flour,” he says. “I can’t do it.” White spelt flour is particularly useful when making pizza or pasta dough, crackers and pâte brise. Maffei also prefers the flavor of spelt flour, which she describes as “sweeter, in the family of a caramelized onion. It’s a fruity, savory kind of sweet.”1063 2008-11-30 WOMEN at the maximum-security prison here have been training dogs to help the disabled for a decade, but they seldom get to see the fruits of their work, to see their dogs actually serving people. Steel bars and barbed wire kind of make that impractical.Well, when Muhammad can’t come to the mountain, the mountain can sometimes come to Muhammad. About 10 days ago, the women in the dog-training unit received a visit from Sgt. William Campbell, a 47-year-old veteran of the worst days of the Iraq War. He sustained such severe concussions and post-combat stress, from car bombs while patrolling with his Army National Guard unit, that for a time he was too frightened to leave his house in Washington State. Even while at home he was jolted by nightmares and flashbacks. This for a broad-shouldered wildlife biologist who had been a plucky climber, bicyclist and scuba diver.Then he was given Pax, a yellow Labrador retriever who was trained by the group of 27 women at the Bedford Hills Correctional Facility through a nonprofit program, Puppies Behind Bars. As Mr. Campbell, in his olive-green Army uniform, told the women, sitting in their olive-green prison uniforms with their dogs in a prison lounge: “I’m here in New York. I’m walking the streets again.”A trip to the supermarket can still resurrect images of the bloody streets of Baghdad, with fears of nesting snipers and approaching mortar. So Pax clings to Mr. Campbell’s side and watches his back to help let him feel safe. When horror-filled dreams wake Mr. Campbell, Pax is there to remind him he is sleeping in his own bed, at home. When Mr. Campbell has trouble remembering details like the number of children he has — four — Pax steadies him. Pax gives him the unalloyed affection and attention that no human is capable of. Pax takes him out of his prison.Hearing what Pax and eight other dogs serving wounded veterans of Iraq and Afghanistan have accomplished gave the women — many serving sentences for murder, though often their victims were their tormentors — a deep, redemptive satisfaction. Despite being in prison, they could believe that their mismanaged lives might still be salvageable, might still have purpose. Many recounted their stories so eloquently and affectingly that it made listeners contemplate the thinness of the line between the law-abiding and the felonious. Tears flowed, and Gloria Gilbert Stoga, the program’s founder, had to pass around tissues, using several herself.1064 2008-11-30 DECEMBER traditionally brings the most visitors to the Hudson River Museum in Yonkers, where thousands flock to see holiday decorations in the historic Glenview mansion or take part in the many programs and workshops planned for families. This year, aware that families may be hard-pressed to pay admission fees, museum trustees have decided to drop the fees entirely and offer free admission to the public from Nov. 28 through Jan. 4.“It’s a gift to the community,” Michael Botwinick, the museum’s director, said in a phone interview. Referring to the precarious economy, he said, “Instead of adding to the doom and gloom, we thought we would spread some cheer.”The free admission period coincides with a “free arts day” on Dec. 7 that will involve numerous Westchester groups and is being coordinated by the Westchester Arts Council.Last December, a total of 5,000 people visited the Hudson River Museum, paying admission fees of $5 for adults and $3 for students and those 62 and older. Accounting for members, who pay no admission charge, the total collected was around $5,000, Mr. Botwinick said — a figure that might have been equaled this year. He said the idea of forgoing the income arose impromptu at a board meeting during a discussion about the impact of the economy on museum attendance. “We asked if we could take a hit in the budget if we did this,” Mr. Botwinick said. “The board said, ‘Let’s worry about that later.’ It can’t always be about the money.”In effect, he said, board members have offered to make up the missed income themselves if necessary.Mr. Botwinick said the museum was managing its own financial pressures by reducing its budget by 10 percent over the past year — to $2.7 million from $3 million — and leaving several vacant staff positions unfilled. He said a more worrisome issue was a potential steep cut to the New York State Council on the Arts, which provides money to the museum and other arts organizations.Planetarium tickets at the Hudson River Museum will remain $2 and $1 during the free admission period, except for Friday shows at 7 p.m., which are always free. Other free activities and performances include the Snow Maiden puppet show today at 3 p.m.; a curator’s tour of Glenview, an 1877 river home decorated in Victorian tradition, on Dec. 7 at 2 p.m.; and a klezmer concert with Yale Strom and the Hot Pstromi Band on Dec. 14 at 1 p.m. Current exhibitions include “Andrew Stevovich: The Truth About Lola,” a painting and drawing show; and “Whitfield Lovell: All Things in Time,” a tableaux of found objects and charcoal portraits focusing on the lives of African-Americans from Reconstruction through World War II.1065 2008-11-30 “I have faith that eventually the international respect being paid to the art scene will carry over to the music scene,” said Michael-John Hancock, the singer of ANR. He and his band mate, Brian Robertson, were among the first in a small wave of graduates of the University of Miami’s Frost School of Music to stay and make a stand as a band.It may not seem surprising for a metropolitan area the size of South Florida to have a thriving rock scene. But Miami has never been a typical American city; as the joke goes, “It’s lovely, and so close to the U.S.” While Miami has countless dance clubs, there are very few establishments that support live local music. The city has long been a center of the Latin music industry, but Latin artists have trouble finding places to play too. Miami rappers like Rick Ross, Trina, DJ Khaled and Flo Rida have made “da Bottom,” as they call it, a major player in the world of hip-hop, but they’ve built their reps through strip clubs, mixtapes and cameos on other artists’ recordings.For bands the city’s physical isolation presents obstacles. Whereas musicians in the Northeast can tour from one major city to another to build a regional fan base, for Miamians it’s about an 11-hour drive to Atlanta, the next musical mecca. “Geographically it’s a struggle to get out of South Florida,” Mr. Jeffries said.And the transient nature of a city full of tourists and immigrants fosters a nightlife that’s built around partying. The music that D.J.’s spin in local clubs is heavily beat driven: hip-hop, techno, trance. Until recently, the primary outlet for the alternative crowd was the experimental electronic genre called intelligent dance music.Fortunately for Miami rock fans there is Churchill’s. In 1979 David Daniels, an expat veteran of England’s northern soul scene, founded the club that — from its grotty interior to its Bowery-esque surroundings — is the CBGB of Miami. Mr. Daniels rents the adjacent space to Sweat Records, a store and coffeehouse whose owner, Lauren Reskin, is a funnel for information on the local art and music scene.“Everything happens at Churchill’s,” Ms. Goodrich said. “It’s so real. It’s old and it’s magical, and there’s a lot of secrets there.”Churchill’s has long been home to Miami’s small punk world. Over the last few years, in sojourns to other clubs like Luna Star Cafe in North Miami, as well as under his own roof, Mr. Daniels noticed that the most interesting sounds coming out of these musicians were acoustic. Young troubadours like the Tom Waits-esque Jesse Jackson were playing their songs as if it were 1960 and Miami were Greenwich Village. Mr. Daniels asked two of those musicians, Raffa Jo Harris and Rainer Davies, to host an open mike every Wednesday. In more than a year the series, Rock a Little Softer, has become an incubator for local talent. You might hear the echoes of Kate Bush in the strummed musings of Sharlyn Evertsz, Sol Ruiz’s neo-hippie soul, the wonderfully retro harmonies of Sirens & Sealions and always, Raffa & Rainer’s vintage-quality jazz folk.As Rock a Little Softer has shown, a shortage of musical talent is not Miami’s problem. That’s why after living in multiple foreign cities, including London and Bogotá, Andrew (DJ Le Spam) Yeomanson, the leader of the Spam Allstars, has stayed here for 18 years.“We have this great jazz school,” the Frost School of Music, “that is attracting a talent pool to our city,” Mr. Yeomanson, 38, said. “You have these young horn players that are out there and they’re hungry, they want experience, so there’s that to draw on on one side. And then there’s this incredibly diverse group of musicians that are coming from Latin America and especially Cuba, where you have this really high level of musicality and training. Plus there’s musical refugees from the Caribbean. Mix that with talented people that are already here, plus misfits like me who just show up, and you have a really interesting tapestry to draw from.”Frost has acclaimed programs in jazz, classical, film scoring and engineering. In years past its students would return home or go to New York, Los Angeles, or at least Atlanta once they graduated. “If there wasn’t a scene or a beginning of a scene, U.M. students would just leave,” Ms. Harris, 27, said. “Now there are places to play, they stay.”Graduates are helping to give the local scene what it needs most: infrastructure. Curtis Nystrom, 24, came to the University of Miami from Manhattan to study jazz. He fell in love with the city and decided to stay to play with his band the JeanMarie, and to run Hear Miami. Mr. Nystrom praises the galvanizing effect Art Basel has had on the city’s creative mind-set.“It’s this electric city,” he said. “Especially right now you can feel it. The weather’s changing. You can start to feel people get motivated. You don’t only hang out with musicians, you hang out with artists and writers. For sure, the art scene has facilitated that cultural growth. I’d like to see it spread even more.”In a former rag shop not far from Churchill’s is the most impressive testament to the changing nature of not just the Miami scene, but of the music industry in general. Mr. Scapa, a graduate of university’s advertising program, and J. Reade Fasse, who received his degree in engineering from Frost, opened Honor Roll a few months ago as a production house-record label-musician’s cooperative. They built six recording studios and hired a number of their old classmates including members of ANR, Airship and the Down Home Southernaires to score commercials and soundtracks and to record their own music. Honor Roll is like the Brill Building meets Sub Pop. “We’re old school,” Mr. Scapa said. “We’re developing the bands. This isn’t cookie-cutter pop. This is art that deserves a chance to be born and nurtured.”In a sense Honor Roll finances its musicians’ art projects — their bands — by hiring them to do commercial work. The musicians say they are comfortable with churning out jingles in exchange for having their own studio to work in every day, free of charge.Mr. Fasse and Mr. Scapa could have returned to their respective hometowns, Atlanta and Los Angeles, but they could never have afforded a space like the Honor Roll warehouse. Nor could they have made such a profound local impact. Likewise Ms. Goodrich is eager to hit the road and see the world, but she always wants to come home, to thrive on the ambience of a metropolis that is still rapidly becoming.“I love being here,” she said. “It feels so free outside. I don’t have to put on a million things to get around. I enjoy the blue sky and the rain. I go to the beach. The colors here are amazing. And the characters down here. There’s a constant flow of people.”1066 2008-11-30 It is, he said, a “zen thing.”“You’re so focused. You don’t do e-mails or phone calls. I get up at 6, don’t shave or shower, just start drawing. It’s like a ride. I hear that novelists do this too. They’re so focused for a year or whatever that afterwards they just collapse for two or three weeks. Sleep. Or drink.”Other artists take other tacks. Henry Selick (“Tim Burton’s The Nightmare Before Christmas”) is currently going through the painstaking stop-motion process, of the type that has put into action the likes of Gumby and Wallace & Gromit. His new work, “Coraline,” is scheduled for February release.“You want to get your hands onto it,” Mr. Selick said, when asked what motivates his use of clay models and real objects rather than the ubiquitous computer-generated imagery. “That’s what it’s about for me.”Others, including Don Hertzfeldt, Signe Baumane and Mr. Plympton, draw everything by hand. But the subject matter wanders far beyond the perils of the putty tat: sex and regret (“A Letter to Colleen,” by Andy and Carolyn London); a fascist bird empire conquering a clockwork London (“Bathtime in Clerkenwell” and “Last Time in Clerkenwell,” by Alex Budovsky); a teenage girl petrified by pregnancy (Ms. Baumane’s “Birth”). Or the agonies of bubble wrap, as it awaits the inevitable pop (“Fantaisie in Bubblewrap,” by Arthur Metcalf).Serious animation is not unknown in the United States, although the market situation might be comparable to that of California wine, pre-1976. “Waltz With Bashir,” the coming Sony Pictures Classics animated release about the Israeli invasion of Lebanon in the 1980s, is as serious as film can get. “Persepolis” and “The Triplets of Belleville” were major examples of a post-Looney Tunes approach and a maturity of subject matter, if not necessarily technique. But all three are imports. To get their work seen, most animators in the United States have to move their work the other way.Ms. Baumane arrived in New York in 1995 from Latvia and finally found a producer for her work in Italy. Her “Teat Beat of Sex” is a semi-autobiographical, quasi-philosophical 15-chapter adventure about growing up erotic. As powered by Ms. Baumane’s excitable narration, each short film could be a stand-up comedy routine, although she likes the permanence of being on film, as well as the opportunity to provoke: “I think by shocking people you expand their perceptions.”“I get refused by a lot of animation film festivals because they don’t consider my work ‘animated,’ ” Ms. Baumane said, explaining that she will devote as few as four frames to an image, which gives a less fluid movement to the projected film. (Animated films typically use 24 frames per second.) That exclusionary attitude is the kind of thing that would probably make Mr. Hertzfeldt see red.“I don’t know why these things have to be framed as a big dumb cage match,” said Mr. Hertzfeldt, an Oscar-nominated director who is currently touring the country with his latest short, “I Am So Proud of You,” the follow-up to his acclaimed “Everything Will Be OK.” “Hand-drawn versus computers, film versus digital. We have over 100 years now of amazing film technology to play with. I don’t know why any artists would want to throw any of their tools out of the box.“Many people assume to that because I shoot on film and animate on paper I must be doing things the ‘hard way,’ when in fact my last four movies would have been virtually impossible to produce digitally.”Expense and time are the little-known facts of digital animation. Mr. Plympton, who spends several hundred thousand dollars on his features, said that when he hired someone to create a digitized hotel for his movie ‘Shuteye Hotel,” “it was six months late and six months over budget.”Mr. Hertzfeldt, who shoots his work on a rare old 35-millimeter camera, said: “A lot of people seem to assume that there is a ‘make art’ button on a computer and everything in the digital world is magical and easy. There are endless misconceptions about how these tools work and little understanding how computer animators have to slave away just as hard as traditional animators do.”Despite the demands and hurdles, these animators keep coming back for more — particularly Mr. Plympton, who has pushed the tenacity thing to an Olympic level.“To make an animated film every six months, to do a feature film in one year, one person, it’s never been done,” he said. “To make six feature films by myself? I don’t know if that will ever be duplicated.” He burst out laughing. “Why would it be?”“The only thing that matters is what actually winds up on the big screen, not how you got it there,” he said. “You could make a cartoon in crayons about a red square that falls in unrequited love with a blue circle, and there wouldn’t be a dry eye in the house if you know how to tell a story.”1067 2008-11-30 IF you didn’t know better, had never been taught the proper technique, you might approach a piano with your hands flat and fingers splayed, as if instead of striking the keys you were going to dribble them. This may be why Irving Berlin, who never studied music except with his ear, favored the ebonies over the ivories when he first started playing. His melodies found their home among the black keys, making excursions as necessary to the white, with the result that the tunes all emerged in the absurd six-sharp thicket of F-sharp major or its corresponding D-sharp minor.The first song for which Berlin wrote both music and lyrics was copyrighted in 1908, and the last ditties found among his papers are dated 1987, two years before his death at 101. He didn’t last that long as an artist by being inflexible. Realizing that his black-key proclivity limited his reach, he purchased a series of rare instruments called transposing pianos. They featured a mechanism that could shift the entire keyboard up or down, causing the hammers to strike the “wrong” strings and thus play his tunes in any desired key. What started in F sharp could now become the F of “Puttin’ On the Ritz” or the C of “Cheek to Cheek” — a good thing for his publishing business, which depended on amateurs buying sheet music to play at home on their spinets. But how did those songs get to be what they were in the first place? Did his lack of training somehow make his style universal?Hoping to see if the magic was in his pianos, I recently tried one at the New York City headquarters of Ascap (American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers), of which Berlin was a charter member in 1914. But the instrument, temporarily stored under a tarp in a hallway, was decades out of tune, its famous mechanism jammed. Music played on it was muddy and untransposable.The mystery is why so much of Berlin’s catalog is not similarly stuck in the past. Of his 1,250 known songs (some with only lyrics extant), perhaps a fifth are top-drawer and an astonishing 100 still live in our ears. (Recent licenses include “Anything You Can Do” for an N.F.L. promo and “They Say It’s Wonderful” for “Spider-Man 3.”) They are not the most technically advanced of what we now think of as the Big Five’s standards; Gershwin, Kern, Porter and Rodgers, all trained musicians, had more sophisticated tools at their disposal. But the Berlin standards hold their own with aficionados while surpassing all others in popular acceptance. Bing Crosby’s version of “White Christmas,” first released in 1942, has sold more than 125 million copies, making it the best-selling recording of all time.Certainly the producers of “Irving Berlin’s White Christmas,” which opened for a holiday run at the Marquis Theater on Nov. 23, are betting that even (or especially) in an economic downturn, audiences will flock to what they already love. Hoping to offer Broadway and regional theaters a seasonal alternative to “A Christmas Carol” and the Grinch, they have packed the lavish stage musical with goodies from the Berlin catalog. The show, directed by Walter Bobbie, with a book by David Ives and Paul Blake, includes the catchiest numbers from the 1954 Bing Crosby-Danny Kaye movie on which it’s based — including “Sisters,” “The Best Things Happen While You’re Dancing” and of course the title song. But it also interpolates Berlin standards like “How Deep Is the Ocean?” and “Blue Skies.” As each tune starts, you feel the rush of reunion with something long thought unrecoverable.Still, as at reunions, you study the effects of time. To give the score a unified feel, the musical team of “White Christmas” — the music supervisor Rob Berman, the orchestrator Larry Blank and the vocal and dance arranger Bruce Pomahac — has passed all the songs, which were written over a 40-year period starting in 1915, through a mid-’50s strainer. This makes sense for the story, which is welded to the Eisenhower years, but homogenizes the oddities and variety of the raw material. Whether written in the style of ragtime, jazz, Tin Pan Alley, big band, Hollywood or Broadway, the songs come out sounding not unlike a Bing Crosby holiday special.1068 2008-11-30 CROSSING THE SWISS ALPS ON THE BERNINA EXPRESS, Aug. 19, 2008 Ans Mooi, 64, a high school Latin and Greek teacher from Amsterdam.
