"'12-03-01,'1','However, the calendar is now favorable for him in one important way: precisely because these states are uphill battles for him, his risks are now weighted more toward the upside.Perhaps the worst-case scenario for Mr. Romney is that his victories are limited to three states — Massachusetts, Virginia and Vermont. He loses everything else, including the several caucus states to vote on Super Tuesday — as well as Washington, which holds its caucus on Saturday.Such an outcome undoubtedly would be damaging to Mr. Romney, and would make his nomination less assured. But it would essentially make the campaign revert to the status quo as it existed a few days ago.And the status quo is basically favorable to Mr. Romney. He leads in the delegate count, in the popular vote, in endorsements from elected officials, in the number of states won and in virtually every other conventional or unconventional measure of his standing.He does not, to be sure, lead by all that much. But if Mr. Romney is fairly close to achieving a majority of delegates and none of the other candidates are, he will probably win the nomination, and probably before the convention.Such a situation would resemble the 2008 Democratic race between Barack Obama and Hillary Rodham Clinton, which turned into a fight for delegates. This time, Mr. Santorum would win many Southern and heavily evangelical states, while Mr. Romney would win many Northern and more affluent states.Michigan (like Arizona, which he won easily on Tuesday, and Florida, which he won on Jan. 31) was interesting precisely because a loss there would have been particularly damaging for Mr. Romney. It could have provided unambiguous evidence that the Republican electorate was rejecting him, creating an opening for either Mr. Santorum or a brokered convention and a new candidate.I am not sure that there will exist another such opportunity on the calendar. Losing Illinois on March 20, or perhaps Maryland on April 3, could damage Mr. Romney. But there has been little polling in these states, and losses there would probably not have the narrative consequences that a loss in Michigan or Arizona or Florida would have.Then there are states like California and New York, which have a lot of delegates and where losses would be hard to excuse. But they do not vote until late in the process, when momentum might be of limited value.Mr. Romney could still lose the nomination, but his campaign is relatively well-equipped for a war of attrition. His win in Michigan treaded water at best; his win in Arizona was impressive. Altogether, Mr. Romney is doing just well enough — and not much better — to be on track for the Republican nomination.'"
"'12-03-01,'1','IT’S all about the fit and the details, men’s wear experts like Tom Kalenderian of Barneys New York and Michael Hainey of GQ said in a pre-Oscars article about evening wear for men, “How to Wear a Tux,” that ran in Thursday Styles last week. In particular: a point-to-point fit on the shoulders, a proper trouser break, a flash of white cuff to break the wall of black and accurate collar dimensions to keep guys from looking as if they’re wearing horse collars or a noose.Apparently the memo didn’t get through to much of Hollywood.George Clooney, eagle-eyed readers complained after last week’s article appeared, tends to wear his Armani trousers puddled around his feet and he did it again at Sunday night’s awards. (He also looked as if he should have taken a tip from the ladies and spent the last month pushing away from the table: Mr. Clooney’s suit jacket looked like a corset on a barrel.) Meanwhile, Brian Grazer, the show’s producer, seemed to have borrowed a shirt from his older brother, and Antonio Banderas was one of many who fell into the increasingly common solecism of wearing a businesslike four-in-hand tie with an evening jacket, something that caused Tom Ford to say, “When I see men doing that, I go right up to them and say, ‘This is awful, just wrong.’ ”Naturally, there were others (like Jean Dujardin, winner of the best actor award for “The Artist”) who strayed toward wing collars, a style best left to the guy carrying the drinks tray. And Billy Crystal, the baloney-colored host, wore anachronistic white tie, as if he were about to set sail for a dinner cruise aboard the Good Ship Lollipop.Still, there were men who used this impeccable uniform to fine advantage.Tom Hanks was a walking demonstration of what tailoring is intended to do — everything gravity and the good life can do to a man’s body neatly accounted for in his full-shouldered, double-breasted, six-button Tom Ford tuxedo.The DreamWorks production designer Raymond Zibach was as crisp and graphic as newsprint (remember that?). Christian Bale, in gangster black, upended convention and yet, mostly because he is as thin as a knife blade, managed to make the suit look suitable and personal, an editorial commentary by a man raised in a circus family on just how respectable show people are obliged to be.'"
"'12-03-01,'1','Leela ran away to Mumbai when she was 13, after her father tried to film her nude and in suggestive poses, hoping she could be a porn actress. When she protested, he had her arrested, and she was raped by policemen. She fled from the general horror inflicted on India’s poor young women, in search of a better life.Dancing at Night Lovers was, socially and financially, a step up for her. Bar dancers ranked above other sex workers, Ms. Faleiro explains, “because selling sex wasn’t a bar dancer’s primary occupation and because when she did sell sex she did so quietly and most often under her own covers.”What Leela wants, Leela rarely gets. She dreams of a Bollywood career, and of a good marriage. She’s forced instead to live by her taut body and her even-more-taut wits. “She squeezed the men in her life like they were lemons,” Ms. Faleiro writes, “and once she was through, she discarded them like rinds.”Leela is aware of the limited but genuine power she wields. “They think I dance for them,” she declares of her customers. “But really, they dance for me.”Ms. Faleiro’s book has a resonance that belies its compact size. She focuses on only a few characters: Leela, some of her dancer friends and Shetty, the wily owner of Night Lovers. If “Beautiful Thing” were to be made into a film, Shetty would be played by whomever is the current Bollywood equivalent of Paul Giamatti.With a few strokes Ms. Faleiro conjures a world, and it is mostly a world of hurt and confusion. She spent five years researching and writing this book, and its lessons are presented frankly. “Poverty eventually made criminals of everyone,” she writes of the women and the shady men in their milieu. Noting Mumbai’s unforgiving nature, she says, “Naïveté was fair prey and beauty unguarded deserved what it got.”In another writer’s hands Leela’s story might have become an op-ed tract. But Ms. Faleiro’s book is not a dirge. For one thing Leela is simply too quirky and alive on the page. She might be wealthy from the tips she makes, but the author catches her in unguarded moments.“She loved not paying for her pleasures,” Ms. Faleiro writes. “After the dance bar closed for the night, Leela would waltz from table to table helping herself to half-smoked cigarettes. She would press her cherry-red lips to abandoned beer bottles.”There’s a feminist spark in Ms. Faleiro’s portrayal of these women. One who was raped repeatedly before the age of 10 says to her, “I decided that if this was going to keep happening to me, then at least I should profit from it, I should eat from it.”Leela urges the author not to pity her. “When you look at my life, don’t look at it beside yours,” she implores. “Look at it beside the life of my mother and her mother and my sisters-in-law who have to take permission to walk down the road.”This story can’t end well, and of course it does not. The dance club closes; Leela vanishes into prostitution while the author searches for her. Ultimately Leela loses a tooth in a beating, and she and a friend leave to work in Dubai at the urging of a gangster. You hate to think where she is at this moment.This book, by its end, seems to have taken something out of Ms. Faleiro. You get the sense she’d like to close with even a hint of optimism, but that’s hard to muster. Instead she quotes the gangster, Sharma, who explains that Leela will probably someday preside over a small brothel herself.Sharma issues a line that will ring in your ears. “She will sell her daughter, even if she is her only child, her only family, because her mother sold her, and who is her daughter to deserve better?”Leela, were she to read “Beautiful Thing,” would probably spark up a cigarette and tell us where to stuff our horror and pity. She’d agree with the dancers who declared, within the author’s earshot, “Tears are the indulgences of those who haven’t suffered enough.”'"
"'12-03-01,'1','Q. It’s hard to see anything positive about a bankruptcy that takes seven years.A. Sometimes staying in bankruptcy a longer time was better, because it gave a debtor time to catch its breath.Q. Who wins from this change?A. The LaSalle decision and B.A.P.C.P.A. have given unsecured creditors a huge advantage, and the result is the cost of bankruptcy has gotten so high — because of professional and other costs — that the ability to continue the company under current ownership has reached almost zero. I understand the plight of unsecured creditors, but everyone who sells on unsecured account understands the risk. Every businessman understands this when he sells and makes a credit decision.Q. Really? Small-business owners offer credit like this routinely. You don’t think they expect to get paid?A. You know that old saying, “Let the buyer beware”? I think it’s every businessman’s responsibility to know to whom he sells and offers credit. If I sell to you and you begin to pay very slowly — which often happens before a bankruptcy — I should stop selling to you on credit. But if I continue to sell to you to make a buck, it’s not your fault, it’s mine.Q. So what happens instead of reorganization these days?A. Companies are liquidated. Back in 1983, the Lionel case allowed companies the freedom to sell off assets as opposed to filing a plan of reorganization. It expanded what could be sold in a “363 sale.” The 363 component was originally designed to allow companies to sell off spoilable product, like fruit. If you were in the grocery business and you filed bankruptcy, it allowed you to sell off assets. The Lionel case expanded that so you could sell major assets, virtually including the whole company. That’s a quick way to avoid a plan of reorganization.A. The 363 sale requires nothing more than saying, “I’m going to sell you my equipment,” and I publish that, and for 30 or 40 days people have a right to object to it and the judge can decide, O.K., sell it, or if there’s a higher or better bid, it goes to the highest or best bidder. That happened in the Brunschwig & Fils bankruptcy where I was the chief restructuring officer. I sold the company’s assets for $10 million, very successful, but the original owners lost control and 116 employees lost their jobs. In the old days we would have been able to reorganize the company.Q. How do these changes affect a troubled company’s ability to get financing during reorganization?A. All of these changes say to the world that the chance of a company surviving bankruptcy is much lower. And if it’s much lower, the banks aren’t going to give debtor-in-possession financing — and rightfully so. The D.I.P. financer gets a priority lien. Last in, first out. But the company has to survive to have the money to pay that super-priority lien.Q. Does this change how troubled companies act?A. Debtors are delaying seeking help longer and longer and longer. They’re very frustrated. They’re walking in molasses. They figure if they wait another week the economy is going to turn.Q. What should business owners do instead of filing for Chapter 11?A. People need to seek help quicker, change their business plan quicker, and avoid Chapter 11. It’s just an absolute last resort. It’s virtually nonsurvivable. One of the things we do as consultants is take two weak companies that are facing annihilation and we merge them and we get one survivable company — without a bankruptcy. We also try to make out-of-court settlements with creditors, as opposed to Chapter 11 proceedings. In Chapter 11, the debtor pays for attorneys, accountants and consultants of the creditors’ committee. They even pay for the investment bankers. The owner is paying the other side to oppose him. It’s tilted to the unsecured creditor side.Q. But doesn’t this law fix some biases toward debtors that allowed them to drag out the process, hurting their creditors as they did so?A. The law probably does fix some problems, but you have to look at the nuances. There are some cases with the tighter rules where the creditors get a little more but the company fails. The other option is the bankruptcy lingers and the creditors get a little less but the company survives, and that way the creditors continue to have a customer.Q. You’re a small-business owner yourself. How is your business doing?A. Business right now is kind of quiet. I think this is the calm before the storm.'"
"'12-03-01,'1','But in a conversation late Tuesday night, after he attended a Rangers fund-raising event in Manhattan, Scott said that he understood his role, had no anxiety about it and relished the opportunity to stand up for his new teammates.“I think people can appreciate that my emotions got the best of me, especially so soon after Derek’s tragedy,” Scott said. “Who wouldn’t be thinking philosophically at a time like that? Derek had a problem, and it was devastating what happened to him. Thankfully, I don’t suffer from what he did.“I know who I am and what I am in hockey. I haven’t changed my views about what enforcers do. We are there as a deterrent. I have no regrets about it, no hesitation. When I was in the lineup for the Blackhawks, you almost never saw our opponents get chippy with Jonathan Toews, Patrick Kane and Marian Hossa. I’ll do the same for the Rangers.”Scott, a 29-year-old Canadian, talks the way many of the tough guys in the N.H.L. do, but he followed a nontraditional path. While Boogaard fought his way through the Western Hockey League of the Canadian junior ranks, Scott played four years at Michigan Tech. As a freshman, he did not dream of playing in the pros and was just happy for the scholarship. By his junior year, he thought he had an outside chance of earning a living playing hockey.“I could barely skate when I got to Michigan Tech,” Scott said. “My penalty minutes for my four years there were like between 60 and 100, but there was a difference. The first two years, most of the penalties were for things like tripping and hooking and holding — because I couldn’t keep up. Once my skating got strong, I was guilty more for stuff like roughing and boarding.”Rangers General Manager Glen Sather said he traded a fifth-round pick to Chicago for Scott so he could take care of “the fooling around that happens this time of year.” Scott, who took shifts as a defenseman and forward with the Blackhawks, could also be useful in a potential playoff series against the Boston Bruins, the bruising defending Stanley Cup champions. The Rangers host the Bruins on Sunday, and Scott would love to suit up.“The Bruins’ style of play is that they try to bully you,” Scott said. “It won’t work with us. I love that Mr. Sather is adding me to a roster with guys like Brandon Prust and Mike Rupp. We are team-tough throughout the lineup. If the Bruins think they can take liberties with us, think again.”At practice Wednesday, Scott skated on a line with the 6-5 Rupp and John Mitchell, who is 6-1, before the Rangers departed for Thursday’s game at Carolina.“It’s like they’re the twin towers, and I’m the bridge in between,” Mitchell said.Coach John Tortorella indicated that Scott would not play against the Hurricanes, saying he liked the Rangers’ lineup and would not change it unless there were injuries. Ryan Callahan, who has a bruised foot, did not practice Wednesday.'"
"'12-03-01,'1','Over the past four years, Parnell, 27, has parlayed his 100-mile-per-hour fastball into a seemingly unending audition with the team. He made his debut for the team in September 2008, but has performed inconsistently, at best.Last year, as a matter of circumstance, Parnell became the team’s closer in the final month of the season, with a chance to prove he had the makeup to keep the role. The numbers tell the story, but Parnell will tell it to you, too: he botched the chance, converting just 6 of his 12 save opportunities.In December, his standing on the team plunged further when the Mets in one night signed Rauch and Frank Francisco and acquired Ramon Ramirez in a trade. Though the moves place three right-handers ahead of him on the depth chart — and could be seen as a condemnation of his performance — Parnell said he tried to see the positives of the situation.“I just want to get better,” he said, “and there’s a lot I can learn off the new guys.”Parnell’s teammates describe him as an unassuming person who selectively displays an understated sense of humor. His idea of paradise is a few quiet hours of hunting or fishing. Josh Stinson, one of his best friends in the organization, said the two were planning a duck hunting excursion to Mexico next winter.As a child in North Carolina, Parnell said, he spent “every waking moment” in the woods near his house, which he loved for their tranquillity.There was something surreal, then, about the hoopla when he emerged last year as the team’s possible closer. Reporters crowded his locker, asking him what his entrance music would be. It was reported that John Franco, the Mets’ career saves leader, would be recruited to tutor him.“I was definitely wet behind the ears,” Parnell said. “I definitely could have done better. But I learned a lot from the experience.”The Mets are keeping an open mind about the composition of their bullpen. Along with Rauch and Byrdak, Collins said that Francisco, Ramirez and Manny Acosta were likely to start the season there. A half-dozen other pitchers will be judged in spring training before the front office decides on the two remaining openings.The immediate future for Parnell, who has two minor league options remaining, could hinge on his ability to add a new breaking ball to his repertory. Dan Warthen, the Mets’ pitching coach, said Parnell started looking last summer for something “a little bit bigger, a little bit slower” than the slider he had used as a secondary pitch.Toward the end of the season, Parnell began experimenting with a knuckle-curve, which he honed over a busy off-season in which he married his longtime girlfriend, Maegan. Josh Thole, who has caught Parnell in camp, said Parnell had enough of a handle on the pitch now to throw it consistently for strikes.Warthen said: “I think we’ve found a breaking ball we can stay consistent with. It breaks the speed enough, gets batters off his fastball, and it’s got a tilt on it all the time. The spread of velocity is going to help him a whole bunch.”Warthen said that the pitch was drawing raves from catchers and coaches, but that the true test would come when the games start Monday. Parnell understands the work that lies ahead. He may be discreet, but he is savvy enough to know where he stands.“I mean, I can get caught up in the logistics and business side of it, I really could, but that wouldn’t be the right way to go,” Parnell said. “I feel like I’ve done enough to be in the bullpen in the big leagues and produce.”'"
"'12-03-01,'1','The city has already drastically cut back municipal staff, including the Police and Fire Departments. With nearly 100 fewer police officers than there were just four years ago, many residents fret about rising crime rates; there were 58 murders last year, an all-time high for the city.City Manager Bob Deis blamed previous administrations for the city’s troubles, saying that in his 32 years of municipal management he had “never seen such poor fiscal management practices.”Stockton, about an 80-mile drive east of San Francisco, boomed a decade ago, as eager buyers from Silicon Valley bought up homes in the area. But in the past several years, housing values have plummeted, and the city has steadily had one of the highest foreclosure rates in the country.During the boom times, the city eagerly began development projects to improve the area, transforming the waterfront and refurbishing several buildings that had fallen into disrepair. City officials lured a Sacramento restaurateur to open an upscale bistro, in part by offering space in a historic downtown building rent-free for five years. But the restaurant struggled and closed after just two years, and the space has sat empty and shuttered for the past year.In 2007, after Washington Mutual shut down operations in an eight-story building here, the city bought the space for $35 million, reasoning that the price was a bargain, less than the cost of construction. Officials planned to move out of the crumbling old City Hall building and into the Washington Mutual building, but it soon became clear that the city did not have the money for the move.“The city was very aggressive in trying to take advantage of the boom and got completely swept up in those times — not unlike its citizens,” said Jeffrey Michael, the director of the Business Forecasting Center at the University of the Pacific. “It’s a combination of bad luck and bad management. If they’d been more prudent, you might still be cutting back 20 percent of the staff, but maybe you wouldn’t be dealing with the brink of bankruptcy.”The city consented to a wide variety of bond agreements that have contributed to its increasing debt, but officials say that generous retirement health benefits and the increasing costs of maintaining them also threaten to cripple the city with insolvency. The city estimates that it will pay $9 million in retiree health care benefits in the 2012 fiscal year, and that the amount will double over the next 10 years.Much of the harshest criticism of the current city administration has come from the police union, which has accused Mr. Deis of manipulating numbers. The union paid for billboards that proclaimed “Welcome to the 2nd most dangerous city in California: Stop laying off cops!” and included a running tally of murders in the city and Mr. Deis’s telephone number, against a background depicting spatters of blood. Mr. Deis accused the union of harassing him after it bought a house next door to his. The union said the purchase was an investment and not intended to antagonize Mr. Deis.“Things have just gone from bad to worse,” said Kathryn Nance, an executive board member of the police union and a Stockton native. “There’s just nowhere to cut anymore, and the whole city is suffering.”But Ms. Nance and other union officials say they believe that the city has more money than it is letting on and criticized decisions to give raises to several top city workers and spend millions on outside consultants and lawyers to help with the fiscal crisis.Councilman Elbert Holman dismissed the union’s criticism by comparing the city to a patient with a life-threatening infection.“If I have to cut off my arm to save my life, it’s a negative thing, but what choice do I have?” he said. “And who do I want to operate on me, an intern who has no experience or someone who has actually done this before? We can’t work off emotions. We just have to be practical.”Even if there are no other options, nobody here sees bankruptcy as an ideal solution, and people fret about another black eye for a place that has twice been ranked the “most miserable city in America” by Forbes magazine.Denise Jefferson, a former city planner and the executive director of the Miracle Mile Improvement District, said previous administrations had ignored signs of problems for years, despite internal criticism from employees.“Everyone kept pretending that the problems were something the next generation could clean up, but there’s no way to clean this up anymore,” she said. “In high times everyone wants to grow, but the growth we had was never something we could sustain. We played the game, and now there’s no longer a game to play.”'"

"'12-03-02,'0','DETROIT — General Motors said on Friday that it planned to halt production of the Chevrolet Volt for five weeks beginning later this month because dealers had more than they needed.The suspension, which will result in temporary layoffs for 1,300 workers at the Detroit plant that builds the Volt, is another troubling sign for the plug-in hybrid, whose sales fell short of G.M.’s targets in 2011. G.M. officials had already backed away from projections that they could sell 45,000 Volts in the United States this year, instead saying that production would match demand.Production is scheduled to stop March 16 and resume April 23, a G.M. spokesman, Chris Lee, said. It will be the third time that Volt production has been stopped for at least a month since the car first went on sale in December 2010. G.M. tripled the plant’s production capacity during downtime last summer, and the plant was down for all of January in preparation for building a lower-emission version that is eligible for car pool lanes in California.“Sales for the Volt in February were significantly better than January, and we anticipate that to continue,” Mr. Lee said. “We see good things in the future, but right now we had to make this adjustment.”G.M. sold 1,023 Volts in February, up from 603 in January, on the heels of a federal investigation into the possibility that its battery pack could catch fire after a severe crash. Regulators concluded that the car was no more dangerous than a traditional gasoline-powered vehicle, though G.M. agreed to strengthen the structure around the battery.G.M. said it had about 3,600 Volts in inventory. Last year, officials repeatedly dismissed questions about low sales numbers by saying the company could not build enough of the cars to meet demand. It ended up selling 7,671 during the year, instead of the 10,000 it had anticipated.'"

"'12-03-02,'0','More than half a century has passed since the Cuban Revolution, and for perhaps a generation American policy has tilted forward, anticipating the post-Castro era. But if Fulgencio Batista’s flight and Fidel Castro’s rise seem the stuff of newsreels (or  “The Godfather: Part II”) to most Americans, those convulsive early years of the Communist regime remain very present to those who fled the island.In “Be Careful! The Sharks Will Eat You!,” a one-man show at the Stage Left Studio, Jay Alvarez elevates family lore into historical testimony, recounting the escape he made in 1964, when he was just 4. The hero of this illegal emigration is his father, Umberto, who came to realize that an uncertain future in the United States was better than what Cuba offered. Umberto’s plan, assembled over a year and growing to include as many as 30 refugees, involved not only securing the permit for a fishing boat large enough for a sea voyage, but also building a new house as evidence of his family’s commitment to stay.Mr. Alvarez, who presented this monologue at the New York International Fringe Festival last summer, is an evocative tale teller. Wearing a guayabera and cargo pants and using only a few slight props, he effortlessly summons up at least half a dozen characters — his father and mother, other relatives and neighbors, even a Coast Guard officer — and swivels easily between English and Spanish.Unfortunately Mr. Alvarez withholds the potentially most gripping elements. It took 30 hours to make it to the American waters near the Florida Keys, but despite the title — Mr. Alvarez recalls it as a warning while boarding the boat — he describes almost nothing of the voyage.Given his obvious attention to detail, the gap is inexplicable and diminishes the play. Didn’t Chekhov — or Spielberg — have a rule about introducing sharks in the first act?'"
"'12-03-02,'0','“Heist: Who Stole the American Dream?” is a documentary polemic that comes out swinging. Immediately after the film’s opening scene of an Occupy Wall Street demonstration, a chipper narrator announces:“The mess we’re in now did not begin on Wall Street. Long before the financial collapse, the dismantlement of government regulation was well under way. All the consequences are the result of a brilliantly executed coup. This is the story of the biggest heist in American history.”Coup? The common notion is of a group of generals overthrowing a government and installing a military regime.Heist? The word conjures images of masked, armed crooks robbing a bank and escaping in a getaway car.But in today’s political climate of overheated rhetoric, dropping loaded words may be the only way to get attention.Be that as it may, this project, produced and directed by Frances Causey and Donald Goldmacher, has the virtue of taking the long view of a crisis that recent films like “Inside Job” and “Too Big to Fail” have only sketchily explored. It makes a strong case that government regulation of business is essential for democracy to flourish. One of many pertinent observations from a host of experts is that the rich really don’t need the government as much as everybody else.'"

"'12-03-02,'0','As successful as the strategy has been, though, it has raised questions about Mr. Romney’s role in turning the primary process into something akin to a civil war, even as it has demonstrated a ferocious, whatever-it-takes style that could hearten Republicans if Mr. Romney ends up in a general election matchup against Mr. Obama.“It’s clear the negative ads are what’s keeping this guy alive,” said Nelson Warfield, a Republican strategist who worked for Mr. Perry. “It seems like Republican primary voters will not vote for Mitt Romney unless they are forced into it. And the way they’re forced into it is when he beats the other guy senseless.”Throughout the campaign, Mr. Romney has also been on the receiving end of attacks from his Republican rivals as well as Democrats. But his aggressive style has been apparent since his first days in politics. For all that he can appear stiff and scripted at times, Mr. Romney has never shied away from deploying pointed and colorful broadsides against his opponents.In his 1994 campaign against Senator in , it was Mr. Romney, a executive new to politics, who fired off the first negative commercials. One of them featured grainy, slow-motion, black and white images of Mr. Kennedy painfully easing his body onto a park bench, before cutting to a full-color video of Mr. Romney.The message was not lost on viewers: Mr. Kennedy, then 62, was old and out of shape, a fixture of the past; Mr. Romney, 47, was young and vigorous, a promise of the future.Angry aides to Mr. Kennedy called it “video sleaze.” Robert M. Shrum, Mr. Kennedy’s admaker, recalled thinking: “You could see people sitting around in a room and laughing as they put it together. It was smarmy.”But the commercials — amplified by ads challenging Mr. Kennedy’s Congressional record on crime and job creation — helped turn what many analysts had expected to be a blowout into a surprisingly competitive race.“We took on water because of it,” Mr. Shrum said. “They were effective.”In 2002, when he ran for governor of Massachusetts, Mr. Romney vastly outspent his Democratic opponent, State Treasurer Shannon O’Brien, whom he depicted in debates, speeches and ads as a self-dealing and entrenched vestige of a bankrupt political culture.The Romney campaign arranged for a man in a chicken costume to trail Ms. O’Brien at campaign stops, to suggest she lacked political courage. It questioned her husband’s ties to , for whom he had once been a lobbyist.And it rolled out a memorable television ad that portrayed Ms. O’Brien as a hapless basset hound, asleep on the floor as sinister-looking men walked out of a building with bags of money, a clever, if misleading image (employees of the state’s previous treasurer had been accused of stealing money.)She lost the election by a slim margin. “When he ran positive ads, he wasn’t winning,” said Ms. O’Brien, who asserts that some of the ads from the Romney campaign “bordered on dishonest.”Mr. Romney’s rivals have long feared the ability of his formidable message machine to tear opponents down. But they are also consoled, they said, by the fact that his campaigns have often struggled to create a positive image for him.""I think that’s Romney’s M.O. His success in politics has come by running tough, hard, negative campaigns against opponents,” said Tad Devine, who helped run Mr. Kennedy’s campaign against Mr. Romney. “And the thing about negative campaigns, and I have certainly seen this up close and from afar, is they come at a cost. When you spend most of your political capital doing that, it leaves you open.""In 2007, when he first ran for president, Mr. Romney sent mailings in and suggesting that his rivals had a weak record on illegal . (One featured photographs of Senator of and with digitally superimposed black eyes.) But Mr. Romney dropped out early in the primary season, avoiding the kind of nasty, drawn-out brawl that has become locked in this time around.Current and former strategists said that in the early phase of his political life, Mr. Romney expressed some unease about attacking.His willingness to engage in negative campaigning, they said, springs from a conviction — rivals might call it a rationalization — that he is a more capable and principled steward of government than his opponents.Alex Castellanos, an adviser to Mr. Romney in the 2008 campaign, summed up the philosophy this way: “If you disqualify a candidate, if you protect society from touching a hot stone, it’s your responsibility to do that.”Andrea Saul, a spokeswoman for Mr. Romney, said, “Of course distinctions will be drawn in a campaign, but Governor Romney has been focused on his plans to create jobs and turn around the economy, unlike President Obama’s failed policies.”Of course, the Romney campaign has not been entirely negative — more than half of his spending has been on ads considered positive, according to Kantar Media’s Campaign Media Analysis Group. Many of them feature Mr. Romney’s wife, Ann.But negative commercials have accounted for nearly half of all the money Mr. Romney has spent on broadcast television advertising this election — $5.7 million. That is roughly as much as Mr. Gingrich, Mr. Santorum and Representative of Texas have spent combined.As with any campaign, it is the negative ads that most people remember, and political strategists have said that the Romney campaign produced the standout.As part of its successful strategy to prevent Mr. Gingrich from winning , Mr. Romney’s team started digging around for news clips of the former speaker’s ethics case. They found what they thought would make for a devastating ad: video from “The Nightly News” on the day Mr. Gingrich was found guilty by his House colleagues. They produced a 30-second ad that consisted only of delivering the news. There was no announcer, no graphics with caustic allegations.Then the campaign went for maximum exposure: It ran the ad 2,225 times over a five-day period, the most of any ad to appear on Florida television before the Jan. 31 primary.'"
"'12-03-02,'0','JERUSALEM — Israel, in an unusual move, announced on Thursday that it would soon conduct the first test of an advanced antiballistic missile system designed to intercept incoming missiles from enemies like Syria and Iran.Its departure from the traditional hush-hush approach to such tests is meant, at least in part, to avoid misunderstandings by other countries in the region and by Israelis themselves in the current highly charged atmosphere surrounding Iran’s nuclear program. Israel has repeatedly stated that it will not allow Iran to reach nuclear weapons capacity and that it retains the option of a military strike against Iran’s nuclear facilities as a last resort. Any such action would invite retaliation, including the likelihood of missiles fired at Israel.With tensions already running high, some analysts have warned of the dangers of a miscalculation.In November, jittery Israelis jammed emergency telephone lines after the country carried out an unannounced test, firing what experts said was a long-range ballistic missile out to sea from an Air Force base just south of Tel Aviv during the morning rush, feeding already feverish speculation in the news media about Israel’s intentions.Itzhak Kaya, who leads the Arrow missile program at the government-owned Israel Aerospace Industries, announced the test of the Arrow 3 antiballistic missile system at a military and aviation conference near Tel Aviv, and Israel Aerospace issued a statement.The Arrow program is being developed in partnership with the United States. At least one or two tests of different components are carried out every year, according to Doron Suslik, deputy corporate vice president for communications at Israel Aerospace, in coordination with Israel’s Ministry of Defense, the United States Missile Defense Agency and other agencies and subcontractors involved with the project.Mr. Suslik said the test, which is expected to take place in the next few weeks or months, will be what industry experts call a “fly out.” An advanced Arrow 3 missile will be programmed with flight instructions and launched over the sea. It is to explode after a short flight, without intercepting an incoming missile.'"
"'12-03-02,'0','The controversy came into the open the same week that the central bank lent 529.5 billion euros ($705 billion) to 800 banks for three years, the second big infusion of cash in two months.Banks could borrow as much money as they wanted at the benchmark interest rate, currently 1 percent, provided they posted collateral like bonds or marketable securities.To make it easier for small community banks to participate, the central bank expanded its definition of collateral to include mortgages or other outstanding loans. The money was transferred Thursday.The Bundesbank confirmed the existence of the letter by Mr. Weidmann, but sought to play down the impression that there was a conflict between him and Mr. Draghi. He had requested Mr. Weidmann’s thoughts as part of an ongoing discussion of the issue, a Bundesbank spokesman said. The central bank declined to comment.Still, the letter seemed to show that Mr. Weidmann and the traditionally conservative Bundesbank had started dissenting against the growing sums of money that the central bank had been lending to banks on ever-easier terms. Most of the money has flowed to weaker institutions in countries like Greece, Portugal, Spain or Italy.Mr. Weidmann, who serves as Germany’s representative on the central bank’s policy-making body, supported a decision in December to triple the maximum term of central bank loans to three years, a change that has reduced tension in the euro zone.But the Bundesbank also has a history of digging in its heels at what it thinks is overly expansive central bank policy. Mr. Weidmann has been almost as outspoken as his predecessor, Axel Weber, who resigned last year because of policy differences with the rest of the central bank’s governing council.The Bundesbank is also likely to begin pushing harder for euro zone nations to confront problems at individual banks.In some cases that would mean pressuring banks that are effectively insolvent to shut down.That category might include some German banks. Moody’s Investors Service on Thursday downgraded the financial strength of WestLB in Düsseldorf, once one of Germany’s largest banks, to the lowest possible rating. WestLB is in the process of being broken up.Disclosure of the letter from Mr. Weidmann to Mr. Draghi also brought into the open a debate about the structure of the euro zone central banking system that has been raging among monetary policy specialists for months, but has not attracted much public notice outside of Germany.Before the crisis began, countries like Greece or Spain that had big trade deficits would finance their shortfalls through commercial banks and capital markets. But as market financing dried up and was replaced by central bank credit, those shortfalls have been transferred to central bank books.The Bundesbank has acquired a disproportionate share of those potential liabilities — almost half a trillion euros — because it is one of the linchpins in a system known as Target 2 that commercial banks, stock exchanges and other large institutions use to make big transfers of money.Economists like Hans-Werner Sinn, head of the Ifo Institute in Munich, have argued that the stronger European countries are effectively financing the trade deficits of weaker countries and exposing themselves to huge risk that could eventually blow apart the euro. Mr. Sinn is known as a hardliner on monetary policy and has called for Greece to leave the euro zone.Jens Ulbrich, director of the Bundesbank’s economics department, argued in a paper published by the Ifo Institute last year that the huge claims on the central bank’s books are more of a symptom than a problem. Any losses would be shared among euro zone countries, he said.According to the letter described by the Frankfurter Allgemeine, however, Mr. Weidmann has begun to worry whether other countries would be in a position to share the losses.'"
"'12-03-02,'0','The price increase was a result of buyers adding more optional features even as they downsized to save money on gas. The options helped offset the lower profit margins for automakers that small cars generate relative to large trucks.“This is sort of a dream scenario from an automaker’s perspective,” Mr. Toprak said. “They’re selling more cars while spending less money on incentives.”Chrysler extended its string of year-over-year sales gains to 23 consecutive months with a 40 percent increase in February. The company, helped by its widely discussed ad featuring Clint Eastwood during the Feb. 5 Super Bowl, sold 126 percent more passenger cars.“Our product portfolio now contains some of the most fuel-efficient vehicles in our company’s history,” Reid Bigland, the head of United States sales for Chrysler, said in a statement. “A few years ago, higher fuel prices were a major threat to our total vehicle sales, whereas today, those higher prices have become far less of an issue.”Ford reported a 14 percent gain, while G.M. said sales increased 1 percent compared with an unusually strong month a year ago, when it was offering large incentives.Toyota and Honda each reported 12 percent gains, while Nissan’s sales rose 16 percent. Volkswagen, BMW, Mazda, Kia, Suzuki and Jaguar Land Rover each reported increases of more than 30 percent.The big unknown hanging over the auto industry’s recovery remains gas prices.Through Thursday, gas prices had risen for 23 consecutive days, according to the AAA motor club. The national average for regular gas was about $3.74 a gallon, 10 percent more than a year ago.“We do not believe that short-term fluctuations in pump prices will curtail industry growth in 2012,” Don Johnson, G.M.’s vice president for United States sales, said. “That’s because consumers and the overall economy are in much better shape than they were a year ago.”Ford’s chief sales analyst, Erich Merkle, said underlying demand for new vehicles was strong enough that gas prices were not deterring consumers from buying new vehicles. They are going ahead with buying cars but increasingly choosing smaller, more fuel-efficient ones, he said. Ford said it would boost output by 3 percent in the second quarter.“Clearly at some point, gas prices would have a detrimental effect on the economy, but we’re not there yet,” Mr. Merkle said.Over all, sales of small cars rose 27 percent in February, according to the industry research firm Autodata. Toyota said it sold 63 percent more hybrid cars, and this week it began shipping two new versions of its flagship Prius hybrid to dealerships. Toyota on Thursday said it would add 80 jobs this year at a plant in West Virginia so it could build 30 percent more 6-speed, fuel-efficient transmissions.Ford and Chrysler each said sales of their full-size pickups were up more than 20 percent in February. Rising pickup truck sales are viewed as a positive sign for the economy, because those vehicles are often bought by builders and other businesses.Sales of the Chevrolet Volt, G.M.’s plug-in hybrid car, rebounded in February after publicity surrounding a government investigation of the Volt had caused demand for it to drop. G.M. sold 1,023 Volts in February, up from 603 in January. Volt sales last month were more than double that of its chief rival, the all-electric Nissan Leaf, which sold 478.Many people put off replacing their current car or truck during the recession and are now in a position where the vehicle needs to be replaced. The average age of a vehicle on the road today is 10.8 years, the highest on record, according to the research firm R. L. Polk.'"

"'12-03-02,'0','BEIJING — A prominent Tibetan writer living here in Beijing said on Thursday that the police had placed her under house arrest to prevent her from receiving a prize for culture from the Dutch Embassy.The writer, Woeser, said in a telephone interview in the afternoon that there were police officers downstairs in her apartment building, where she lives on the 20th floor. She said she was unsure of the exact number, but had noticed at least two men in a car outside the main door and others waiting nearby. She said Beijing police officers came to her apartment on Wednesday night and told her she would not be allowed to receive the award. “I told the embassy last night that I probably won’t be able to go this evening,” said Woeser, who like many Tibetans goes by only one name.The embassy is giving Woeser an award from the Prince Claus Fund. The fund’s Web site says the award is given out annually to individuals and organizations in Africa, Asia, the Caribbean and Latin America “for their outstanding achievements in the field of culture and development.”Woeser, who has written critically of the Chinese government’s policies in Tibet, said she had planned to go the Dutch ambassador’s residence on Thursday at 6 p.m. to have dinner and receive the award. The ceremony was originally to have been at the embassy but was recently moved to the residence.Christa Meindersma, director of the Prince Claus Fund, said in a written statement that the fact “Woeser is not free to leave her home and freely express herself demonstrates once again the importance of her voice.”'"
"'12-03-02,'0','Nevertheless, with a little focus and some last-minute tutoring, Mr. Ferrell — the only nonnative speaker in an otherwise Spanish-speaking principal cast — was able to fulfill his duties to “Casa de Mi Padre,” an unusual comedy even by his standards. The movie, which will be released on March 16, finds him far afield from crowd-pleasing hits like “Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy” and “Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby,” and looks and sounds nothing like those films.Shot in 24 days on a budget of about $6 million, “Casa de Mi Padre” tells the story of Armando Alvarez (played by Mr. Ferrell), the ne’er-do-well son of a Mexican rancher whose manhood is tested when he falls in love with the fiancée (Genesis Rodriguez) of his flashier brother, Raul (Diego Luna), and is drawn into a violent conflict with a drug baron (Gael García Bernal).If that sounds like the plot of a garden-variety telenovela you might see playing on a cheap TV in a corner of your Laundromat, that is exactly the point.“For some reason,” Mr. Ferrell said, “it just hit me that it’d be really funny not to have the joke be that I speak bad Spanish, but that I actually speak as proficient Spanish as I can muster, and everything is played really straight.”Mr. Ferrell could not pinpoint more precisely where the idea for the movie came from, except to say it had been bouncing around his head for several years.Matt Piedmont, the director of “Casa de Mi Padre,” and Andrew Steele, its screenwriter, suggested that its origins could be traced to their time as writers on “Saturday Night Live,” where they created deliberately awkward and oddly paced skits for Mr. Ferrell: character pieces about shirtless Bible salesmen, or a man who displays his patriotism by wearing star-spangled thong underwear to work.“You’re really excited that it’s just on TV, you pulled this off,” Mr. Steele said in a joint interview with Mr. Piedmont.But even with the involvement of Mr. Ferrell, whose last live-action studio comedy, “The Other Guys,” grossed $119 million at the domestic box office in 2010, the “Casa de Mi Padre” team sensed that this project would not be of much interest to Hollywood.“It’s like having the weirdest house on the block. There’s no cops,” Mr. Piedmont said. “All the marketing places at the studios, they wouldn’t touch it with a 10-foot pole.”It was financed by Nala Films, a Santa Monica, Calif., company that has produced movies like “In the Valley of Elah” and “Dan in Real Life.”Darlene Caamaño Loquet, president and chief operating officer of Nala Films, said that while she and the company’s chief executive, Emilio Diez Barroso, with whom she founded the company, have Hispanic backgrounds, they do not specifically look for films aimed at Spanish-speaking audiences.“To us,” Ms. Caamaño Loquet said, “the definition of Hispanic or Latino themes is not the same as the general entertainment mind-set.” She added, “Our goal is to make mainstream movies that have people that sound and look like us, because we are the mainstream.”Still, a language barrier of sorts cropped up during production, as Mr. Steele, who wrote his screenplay in English, was often explaining to its translator, Patrick Perez, that he wanted the dialogue to sound clunky and imperfect.“It was a constant bargaining all the way through,” Mr. Steele said. “We would have people come in to audition, and they would say, ‘Wow, this is a terrible translation.’ And you’re like: ‘I’m so sorry. I know.’ ”There was also the issue of the linguistically delinquent Mr. Ferrell, who with dialect coaching from Mr. Perez worked round the clock to master his lines and who on the first day of filming had to perform a lengthy monologue about his character’s ideal woman.“It was terrifying,” Mr. Ferrell said, chuckling as if he were recalling a white-water rafting adventure or a wrestling match with a wild animal. “There was a moment of: ‘What did I get myself into?’ It’s the exhilarating part of what we get to do.”Mr. García Bernal, who is Mexican, gave Mr. Ferrell high marks for his Spanish pronunciation, comprehension and vocabulary of swear words. Though the film deals in stock subjects like Mexican drug dealers and corrupt American border policemen, Mr. García Bernal said he was never concerned that it was mocking his native country or culture.“There is no such thing as respectful or disrespectful,” he said. “There is good humor or bad humor. And there’s people that make stupid, not funny, racist jokes, and there’s people that play with the race issue in a very joyful and jovial way.”Mr. García Bernal added: “If we stop and judge every single film the same way, then there’s no film that is safe from the highest morals. It’s a comedy, and in a comedy you can treat touchy subjects as well.”“Casa de Mi Padre” is still fundamentally about the overgrown man-child Mr. Ferrell is best known for playing, but it speaks in a cinematic language foreign to his most popular films. It has a willfully grungy, grind-house aesthetic with outdoor sequences shot in obvious indoor locations; rear-projection footage that repeats over and over as characters drive around in pickup trucks; and a hallucinatory freak-out scene inspired by the films of Alejandro Jodorowsky. (It also has a theme song performed by Christina Aguilera.)But that artistic freedom comes at a cost. The film, which is being distributed in the United States by Pantelion Films, a partnership between the independent studio Lionsgate and the Mexican media company Televisa, will play on only 368 screens when it is released, a fraction of what Mr. Ferrell’s movies typically receive. And its promotional budget will be substantially smaller too.Mr. Ferrell said it was a “bummer” that the film will not initially receive a wider release — not because he needs it to make hundreds of millions of dollars, he said, but because “it would just crack me up if it was in the multiplexes of Omaha, Neb.”Ms. Caamaño Loquet of Nala Films said “Casa de Mi Padre” would be added to more screens if its initial release was commercially successful. And she predicted that it would be. “It will break records in the space it lives,” she said, “and it’s going to open the door for movies like this. I just don’t think we’re in an industry that takes big chances.”For Mr. Ferrell, who has been turning up lately in Old Milwaukee beer commercials shown only in markets like Davenport, Iowa; Terre Haute, Ind.; and North Platte, Neb.; and as an opening lineup announcer for the New Orleans Hornets, the movie is one more opportunity to do something unexpected and mischievous while he has the luxury to take such chances.“It’s one of the more creatively timid times in Hollywood,” he said. “You find yourself going, ‘If they’re not going to make this movie, why don’t I go off and play in this area for little or no money?’ The other thing that was supposed to pay me just went away, so I’m not getting anything anyway.”Not that he has abandoned the big-budget fare that pays the bills and covers the vacations to Sweden: he has just finished “The Campaign,” a Warner Brothers comedy that pits him against Zach Galifianakis as politicians in North Carolina and is planned for release in August.Whether “Casa de Mi Padre” is a sleeper hit or a footnote on his résumé, Mr. Ferrell said he was proud to have gambled on it, and unconcerned about how it might affect his image. That is, unless it convinces viewers that he has mastered the language in which it is presented.“I’m going to be continually letting people down,” he said. “I’ll say: ‘Don’t you appreciate the movie even more? I can’t even speak to you in Spanish right now.’ ”'"

"'12-03-03,'0','The story of Prime Minister David Cameron and his ride on a retired police horse in the Oxfordshire countryside appears, for now at least, to lack the elements of a full-blown scandal. But as political symbols go, the horse and its links to the tabloid newspaper scandal roiling the country seems likely to become, at the least, rich fodder for political satirists and cartoonists.In Brussels on Friday on a mission to shore up Britain’s strained relations with its European partners, Mr. Cameron was peppered with as many questions about Raisa, the horse, as about Britain’s refusal to sign on to a new treaty to enforce budget discipline among the 27 nations of the European Union.The horse became front-page news in Britain this week when testimony before the judicial inquiry investigating accusations of phone hacking and bribery by journalists working for Rupert Murdoch’s London-based tabloids revealed that the most senior Murdoch newspaper executive arrested in the scandal, Rebekah Brooks, had been lent a horse by Scotland Yard when the horse was retired from duty in 2008. The horse, Raisa, was one of only 12 horses retired that year, and police spokesmen said competition for them was intense.Because Mr. Cameron and Ms. Brooks are members of what has become known in Britain as the Chipping Norton set, after a well-heeled social network with homes near one of the beauty spots in the London commuter belt, reports abounded that Mr. Cameron might have ridden Raisa at the country mansion Ms. Brooks shares with her horse-trainer husband, Charlie Brooks. Mr. Cameron’s private home and political constituency are only a short drive away, as is the prime minister’s official country residence, Chequers.But Mr. Cameron’s official spokesmen at 10 Downing Street spent much of the week batting the reports away, calling them unfounded rumors. On Thursday, Mr. Cameron joined in, saying that he had ridden only one horse at the Brooks stables since he became prime minister in May 2010, and “it wasn’t that one.”'"
"'12-03-03,'0','“I vote for the goats,” a person wrote on the Web site of the local paper, The Daily Freeman. The post addressed the town leaders: “Drop your control-freak attitude. Crowd-source it, have a competition, get people engaged.”“This is not a problem, this is an opportunity,” it continued. “Seize it! Occupy Wall Street. With goats.”But city officials were not amused. Some immediately focused on critics of the Pike Plan as the likely perpetrators, and the police investigation began there, too.“I would invite the people who were against the Pike Plan to come out” and say “graffiti is wrong,” Alderman Thomas Hoffay said at the time. “This is mocking the community. It is mocking the people of the city of Kingston.” Later, he likened the goats to gang graffiti, saying, “Bloods, Crips, goats — it’s all the same.”But Ed Butler, who runs a used-record store that was once an art gallery, said the police seemed oddly uninterested in the gang graffiti in the area, but were obsessed with the goats. Others said the big white planters were an open invitation. “When I first saw those planters my first thought was, ‘They might as well leave cans of paint with them,’ ” said Eric Francis Coppolino, a local artist, journalist and astrologer. “You knew what was going to happen.”And when two suspects were arrested in November, they were not politically involved critics of the Pike Plan, but two young artists, Geddes Paulsen, 23, a tattoo artist, and Maggie Salesman, 26. Each was charged with third-degree criminal mischief, a felony, and making graffiti, a misdemeanor. The charges can bring up to four years’ prison time, though neither has been indicted and severe penalties seem unlikely.Mr. Paulsen and Ms. Salesman declined to be interviewed, though people familiar with their thinking said the goal was strictly art, not political protest. But as the initial passions settled, many people became fond of the goats as image and metaphor — scruffy, independent, friendly, determined, one of the most humanlike creatures in the barnyard, with qualities many sheeplike humans might emulate.On the Facebook page, there are links to seemingly kindred spirits and issues local and far beyond — Internet piracy, hydrofracking, urban agriculture, predator drones, sustainability.Raudiel Sañudo, an artist from Bakersfield, Calif., who participated in a show at the Oo Gallery in Kingston, owned by Mr. Paulsen’s father, Kevin, made about 500 red goat stickers, which he sent to the gallery in Kingston. He said in an e-mail that to him the goats signified freedom. “Goats always climb no matter how hard the situation is to survive,” he said. “They are very adaptable, always in evolution.”Monica Snell, a property manager in Wellington, Fla., said she downloaded the goat image from the Facebook page and, in a show of solidarity, stenciled it onto doors in her home.“Every town has this nonsense going on,” she said. “The ruling class is a bunch of boneheads.”Of course, in a town with so much graffiti that one local dentist, Thomas Cingel, spends his nights cleaning it up, many people are torn between affection for the goats and the fine line between vandalism and street art that cost $5,000 to clean up. So Diane Reeder, founder of a nonprofit soup kitchen, the Queens Gallery, said that whoever painted the goats committed vandalism that was “illegal and wrong.”Still, she said, it was striking how the goats ended up saying something profound without trying to. “It brought so many people together,” she said. “These people were able to gather support for something illegal. Why not use that kind of energy to benefit our community, for things that are legal?”That still might happen. The commission considering what to do with the planters and downtown art is to meet on Tuesday, two days before Mr. Paulsen and Ms. Salesman are scheduled to appear in court.The goats have become so popular that there is talk of returning them to the planters or somewhere else in town. Shayne Gallo, the mayor of Kingston, who was elected in November, said that the goats had been good for Kingston’s image, and that he was open to seeing them make a comeback or to having other art replace them on the planters. He added that some punishment like community service would be appropriate for the artists.The Kingston Times, a local weekly, wrote an editorial this week calling for Kingston to embrace its inner goat.“The red goat is a great symbol — simple, striking, edgy, easy to remember and easier to associate with a sense of stubborn defiance,” it wrote. “People get paid a lot of money to come up with stuff like this, and here Kingston is getting it for free.”'"
"'12-03-03,'0','Mr. Zhou does not dwell on such snubs. Nor do they intimidate him. He is a relative latecomer to controversy, turning his attention to politics only after retiring from his full-time job at age 85.But he is making up for lost time. Chatting recently in his study, filled with overflowing bookshelves, Mr. Zhou declared democracy “the natural form of a modern society.” He rejected the argument that China is not suited to it. “You can have democracy no matter what level of development,” he said. “Just look at the Arab Spring.”Many Chinese intellectuals share such beliefs. But the most outspoken are often the aged — Communist Party elders or retired cadres who either rely on the Chinese reverence for the elderly or who no longer worry about the consequences.China’s state news media ignore Mr. Zhou’s political views but not his role as the architect of Pinyin. Three years ago, he figured prominently in an hourlong documentary on Pinyin on the state-run CCTV network.Chinese characters do not directly correspond to sounds. Pinyin’s phonetic alphabet enabled learners to match words easily to actual speech.“It had an enormous impact on literacy,” said Victor H. Mair, a professor of Chinese language and literature at the University of Pennsylvania. All Chinese students now begin to read and write using Pinyin before moving on to characters.Sweet-natured but wry and rigidly dispassionate, Mr. Zhou works at a tiny wooden desk in a government-provided, third-floor walk-up apartment with unpainted concrete walls. His longtime colleague Chen Zhangtai, 80, said Mr. Zhou decided renovations would be too distracting.He described Mr. Zhou as the embodiment of a “true scholar.” He added, “He just always seems at peace with the world.”And continually fascinated by it. His blog entries range from the modernization of Confucianism to Silk Road history and China’s new middle class. Computer screens hurt his eyes, but he devours foreign newspapers and magazines. A well-known Chinese artist nicknamed him “Trendy Old Guy.”MR. Zhou was born on Jan. 13, 1906, when the Qing Dynasty ruled and women bound their feet. The son of a Qing Dynasty official, he married the daughter of a wealthy family and went into banking.After the Japanese invaded in 1937, his family was forced into the countryside to escape Japanese bombs in Chongqing, China’s wartime capital. His 5-year-old daughter died from appendicitis.Although he never joined the Communist Party, Mr. Zhou’s sympathies with it date from that period. In Chongqing, he got to know Zhou Enlai, then the party’s main emissary to the outside world — a relationship that later helped save his life.In 1946, Mr. Zhou and his family moved to New York, where he represented the Xinhua Trust and Savings Bank. He toured the United States in luxury Pullman cars, rode the Queen Elizabeth ocean liner to Europe and fended off offers from Western banks. His intellectual life was equally rich: he had several lengthy chats with Albert Einstein.But shortly before the Communist victory in the Chinese civil war in 1949, Mr. Zhou brought his family home. He taught economics at a university in Shanghai and studied linguistics as a hobby.In 1955, Zhou Enlai, now prime minister, called him to Beijing. The party wanted to make Mandarin China’s national language, simplify Chinese characters and devise a new phonetic alphabet. Mr. Zhou’s son, Zhou Xiaoping, an astrophysicist, said his father protested that he was a mere amateur. He was told: “Everyone is an amateur.”The summons came just in time. The next year, Chairman Mao’s Anti-Rightist Campaign targeted Western-trained economists. One of Mr. Zhou’s best friends, the head of an economic research unit, committed suicide. So did Mr. Zhou’s favorite student.In his new job, Mr. Zhou found tremendous confusion, but also a foundation for his work. In the late 1500s, the Italian Jesuit Matteo Ricci had formulated a system to Romanize Chinese characters. Many English speakers were already using the British Wade-Giles system, developed in the 19th century. Chinese linguists had devised other alternatives.Mr. Zhou’s team wrangled endlessly: how to cope with the homonyms that are rife in Chinese; how to indicate the four tones of Mandarin; whether to use a Cyrillic, Japanese or Roman alphabet, or to invent a new Chinese alphabet based on the shapes of characters.Mr. Zhou argued for the Roman alphabet, to better connect China with the outside world. In 1958, after three years of work, Pinyin — literally “to piece together sounds” — was finished and quickly adopted.THE decade-long Cultural Revolution that began in 1966 wiped out Mr. Zhou’s lingering belief in communism. He was publicly humiliated and sent to toil for two years in the wilderness. Upon his return, he rejoined the government, fighting for Pinyin to be adopted as the international standard. Professor Mair said the United Nations agreed in 1986.Mr. Zhou says Chinese characters will exist for centuries to come. But to his delight, Pinyin has proven ever more useful. Chinese now rely on Pinyin-to-character programs to send cellphone text messages, post on Internet microblogs and write e-mails.Mr. Zhou himself uses a typewriter that converts Pinyin into characters to deliver ever-more pointed critiques of the party in essays and on his as-yet-uncensored blog.About Mao, he said in an interview: “I deny he did any good.” About the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre: “I am sure one day justice will be done.” About popular support for the Communist Party: “The people have no freedom to express themselves, so we cannot know.”As for fostering creativity in the Communist system, Mr. Zhou had this to say, in a 2010 book of essays: “Inventions are flowers that grow out of the soil of freedom. Innovation and invention don’t grow out of the government’s orders.”No sooner had the first batch of copies been printed than the book was banned in China.'"
"'12-03-03,'0','BOISE, Idaho — Lawmakers next door in Washington State just voted to legalize same-sex marriage. Here, they will not allow a bill to be formally filed that would protect gay people from basic forms of discrimination in areas like education, employment, public services and real estate transactions.Next door, the lawmaker who leads the Senate’s most powerful committee, Ways and Means, is the same one who led the gay marriage bill to passage. The lawmaker, Senator Ed Murray of Seattle, is gay. In the final floor debate, he invited all of his colleagues to his wedding.Here, the lawmaker who has spent eight years working for what might seem far less controversial goals is the only openly gay member of the Idaho Legislature. Now with the session well under way and a gay rights bill again showing little sign of getting a hearing, the senator who has been its champion, Nicole LeFavour, plans to become the former only openly gay lawmaker in the Idaho Legislature.Ms. LeFavour, 48, has decided not to seek re-election, for what she says is a very painful reason: she has had enough and she expects things to only get harder.“My partner Carol has put up with a lot of stress and has stood by me as I dealt with a lot of loss,” Ms. LeFavour wrote in a blog post last month. “She’s so smart and keeps me laughing through the hardest times but you can only ask that of someone for so long.”'"

"'12-03-03,'0','DETROIT — General Motors said on Friday that it planned to halt production of the Chevrolet Volt for five weeks beginning later this month because dealers had more than they needed.The suspension, which will result in temporary layoffs for 1,300 workers at the Detroit plant that builds the Volt, is another troubling sign for the plug-in hybrid, whose sales fell short of G.M.’s targets in 2011. G.M. officials had already backed away from projections that they could sell 45,000 Volts in the United States this year, instead saying that production would match demand.Production is scheduled to stop March 16 and resume April 23, a G.M. spokesman, Chris Lee, said. It will be the third time that Volt production has been stopped for at least a month since the car first went on sale in December 2010. G.M. tripled the plant’s production capacity during downtime last summer, and the plant was down for all of January in preparation for building a lower-emission version that is eligible for car pool lanes in California.“Sales for the Volt in February were significantly better than January, and we anticipate that to continue,” Mr. Lee said. “We see good things in the future, but right now we had to make this adjustment.”G.M. sold 1,023 Volts in February, up from 603 in January, on the heels of a federal investigation into the possibility that its battery pack could catch fire after a severe crash. Regulators concluded that the car was no more dangerous than a traditional gasoline-powered vehicle, though G.M. agreed to strengthen the structure around the battery.G.M. said it had about 3,600 Volts in inventory. Last year, officials repeatedly dismissed questions about low sales numbers by saying the company could not build enough of the cars to meet demand. It ended up selling 7,671 during the year, instead of the 10,000 it had anticipated.'"

"'12-03-03,'0','HOME prices in the United States, which seemed to begin to recover in 2009, fell to new lows in 2011, according to the Standard & Poor’s/Case-Shiller index of prices.Seattle and Atlanta were among the metropolitan areas where prices have fallen the most since the national market seemed to hit bottom.“Prices peaked in Seattle after the rest of the United States, so Seattle is a little bit behind in the correction that will bring prices back in line with income levels,” said David L. Stiff, chief economist of Fiserv, which collects the data and calculates the Case-Shiller indexes. Foreclosures are rising there as they are receding in some areas where problems appeared earlier.As seen in the accompanying charts, five of the 20 markets tracked by the Case-Shiller indexes peaked in 2007. Four of them — Seattle; Atlanta; Charlotte, N.C.; and Portland, Ore. — are down at least 7 percent from the spring of 2009. Only Dallas has held up relatively well.Dallas was also a special case during the housing boom; prices there rose more slowly than in any other market except Detroit. One reason for both its slow ascent and subsequent slower fall may be that, because of state laws, refinancing mortgages is harder in Texas. That meant there was less money available to bid up prices in good times, and fewer homes worth less than was owed when the bad times arrived.'"
"'12-03-03,'0','While China and other governments that sanitize the Internet generally do so with little public disclosure, Pakistan is being surprisingly forthcoming about its censorship needs. It published its request for proposals on the Web site of the Information and Communications Technology Ministry’s Research and Development Fund and even took out newspaper advertisements to publicize the project.“The system would have a central database of undesirable URL’s that would be loaded on the distributed hardware boxes at each POP and updated on daily basis,” the request for proposals says, referring to uniform resource locators, the unique addresses for specific Web pages, and points of presence, or access points.“The database would be regularly updated through subscription to an international reputed company maintaining and updating such databases,” according to the request, which was published last month.The tender details a number of technical specifications, including the fact that the technology “should be able to handle a block list of up to 50 million URL’s (concurrent unidirectional filtering capacity) with processing delay of not more than 1 milliseconds.”Following the Arab , which demonstrated the power of the Internet to help spread political and social change, Pakistan’s move to clamp down has set off a storm of protest among free-speech groups in the country and beyond.Opponents of censorship say they are doubly appalled because they associated this kind of heavy-handed approach more with the previous regime of Gen. than with the current government of President .“The authorities here are big fans of China and how it filters the Internet,” said Sana Saleem, chief executive of Bolo Bhi, a group that campaigns against restrictions on the Internet. “They overlook the fact that China is an autocratic regime and we are a democracy.”“What makes this kind of censorship so insidious is that they always use national security, pornography or blasphemy as an explanation for blocking other kinds of speech,” Ms. Saleem said, adding that her site had been blocked for several months in 2010 when it made reference to a ban on Facebook. Access to the social networking service had been restricted because of a page featuring a competition to draw the prophet Mohammed — something that is considered blasphemous by Muslims.The Technology Ministry’s Research and Development Fund says in its tender that the Internet filtering and blocking system will be “indigenously developed,” but campaigners like Ms. Saleem say they think it is likely the agency will try to adapt Western technology for the purpose.To try to prevent this from happening, Ms. Saleem wrote to the chief executives of eight international companies that make Net filtering technology, asking them to make a public commitment not to apply for the Pakistani grant.On Friday, one of them, , which is based in , responded, declaring in a statement on its Web site that it would not seek the contract.“Broad government censorship of citizen access to the Internet is morally wrong,” Websense said. “We further believe that any company whose products are currently being used for government-imposed censorship should remove their technology so that it is not used in this way by oppressive governments.”Websense had previously withdrawn the use of its technology from after facing accusations from the OpenNet Initiative, a U.S.-Canadian academic group, and other organizations that it had been used by the government of that country to stifle political expression on the Internet.Governments around the world buy filtering and blocking technology to root out illegal content like . Some private companies employ it to restrict access to social networks and other distractions on company computers.But the use of Western technology to rein in political speech in countries with repressive regimes has come under increasing scrutiny since the Arab Spring. The OpenNet Initiative said in a report last year that at least nine governments in the or North Africa had used such products, with the Western companies maintaining lists of sites to be blocked, including sites featuring skeptical views of Islam and even dating services.Even before implementing its new system, Pakistan has been an active censor. The country was 151st, out of 179, on a ranking of media freedom by the Paris-based group Reporters Without Borders in 2011.“Reporters Without Borders urges you to abandon this project, which would reinforce the arsenal of measures for communications surveillance and Internet censorship that have already been put in place by your government,” the group wrote in a letter Friday to Prime Minister .To free-speech advocates in Pakistan, the government’s seeming insouciance about censorship is a particular cause for alarm.“This is a case study,” said Ms. Saleem of Bolo Bhi, which is based in Karachi and whose name means “speak up.” “No government has ever done this so publicly.”'"

(AP) — The photograph shows a hunter with a proud smile holding a slain, man-sized mountain lion in a snowy wilderness — a memento from a successful Idaho hunting trip that has become a political nightmare for the hunter.The man in the photograph is Dan Richards, the State Fish and Game Commission president in California, where cougar killing is banned.Since the photograph surfaced in a California hunting journal last month, Mr. Richards has faced growing criticism, and animal rights activists and 40 California Democratic Assembly members have demanded that he resign from his appointed position. And on Thursday, he was hit with a complaint to the state’s ethics commission that the lion hunt was an illegal freebie.Defiantly defending himself, Mr. Richards has rebuffed calls to step down and has said that he not only killed the cougar in Idaho, where it was legal, he ate what he shot, as good hunters do.Mr. Richards is a Republican commercial real estate developer from San Bernardino County who unsuccessfully ran for governor during the 2003 recall election, garnering 383 votes.

"'12-03-04,'0','Re “Moral Hazard: A Tempest-Tossed Idea” (News Analysis, Feb. 26), which said the concept refers to “the undue risks that people are apt to take if they don’t have to bear the consequences.”The article asked whether it was better to avoid moral hazard by maintaining a homeowner’s overwhelming debt, or to bail out the homeowner at everyone else’s expense. The best choice is neither. This is exactly the situation that the notion of bankruptcy was designed to address, forcing both borrowers and lenders to take their losses and move on. Painful for both, it requires borrowers to adjust to their new circumstances and the lender to take a “haircut.” Society doesn’t bail out either, and the borrower gets a better shot at getting back on his or her feet.Many people don’t want to go this route. But whether we are talking about over-indebted homeowners or whole countries like Greece, an unwillingness to take the short-term pain of wiping the slate clean only prolongs the borrower’s suffering and defers recovery for both borrower and society. Jeff BodenstabThe concept of moral hazard plays an important role in helping to sustain high health care costs.Health insurance has the effect of insulating patients from their full costs of care. There is moral hazard in that people will use health care services more if they are insured than if they have to bear the full costs of these services. This form of consumer behavior thus leads to higher utilization of health care services and potentially higher systemwide costs.'"
"'12-03-04,'0','Largely because of tensions in Iran and other countries in the region, oil prices rose more than 22 percent in the six months through Thursday, according to John LaForge, commodity strategist at Ned Davis Research.While those numbers may be disquieting, they haven’t had much of an effect on either the stock market or consumer sentiment, said Ed Yardeni, an independent economist who has analyzed the price surge.Partly because energy companies including Exxon and Chevron account for 12.3 percent of the market capitalization of the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index, rising oil prices “may actually be good for the stock market, up to a point,” he said.Since the second half of 2008, Mr. Yardeni says, there has been a strong positive correlation between energy prices and the stock market.If prices continue to rise, though, that benign influence is unlikely to last, he says. “At some point, you’ll have a negative feedback loop. High energy prices will correct themselves, and if they go high enough, the negative effects will spill over to stocks and the economy.”Ned Davis Research has found that when oil prices climb by more than 33 percent in a six-month period, stock market performance then tends to weaken, Mr. LaForge said. Prices may not be a big problem right now, he said, but that could change quickly.How high will those prices go?Presumably, futures prices already reflect the collective intelligence of the financial markets, said Richard B. Hoey, chief economist of BNY Mellon. “Those prices already factor in the risks of a possible war with Iran or an incident in the Strait of Hormuz that disrupts oil shipping,” he said.He added that he expects that the impasse over Iran’s nuclear program will be resolved peacefully — and believes that, at the moment, the markets think likewise.Mr. Hoey said that oil prices might spike further, but that they were likely to come down without much lasting harm. “Of course, you never know,” he added.In the past, the domestic effects of rising gasoline prices have sometimes included a decline in auto sales. So far, though, the most recent energy price surge hasn’t had that effect.To the contrary, auto sales rose sharply in February, carmakers and analysts said last week, with the seasonally adjusted selling rate for new vehicles climbing to about 15.1 million, the highest level since February 2008.Rising energy prices tend to have a lagging economic impact, said James D. Hamilton, professor of economics at the University of California, San Diego. Unless income also rises — which isn’t happening for many people now — higher fuel costs will eventually displace other expenditures. And at a certain point, he said, there will be additional “nonlinear” effects if prices keep rising.It’s as though people finally sit up and really notice the price increase, and their behavior changes. “There’s no single magic moment when it happens,” he said. But the data indicates that this effect tends to kick in when the highest price level of the preceding three years is surpassed, he said.We’re not at those levels, but we could easily get there. For regular gasoline in the United States, that average price point would be $4.11 a gallon in nominal terms, and $4.27, accounting for inflation. For oil prices, it would be $145.29 a barrel for benchmark American crude, or $150.87, when inflation is factored in.Ugly-looking prices at the pump are never a good omen for incumbent politicians. Since 1976, they have generally been inversely correlated with presidential approval ratings, Ned Davis Research has found.In other words, the more expensive gasoline is, the less popular the president tends to be.The financial reason for this is obvious: with the possible exception of energy investors, few people enjoy paying more to drive. And because fuel costs affect many other items, including food, rising gasoline prices are often associated with an increase in the cost of living.ON the other hand, the behavioral changes cited by Professor Hamilton include measures to reduce energy expenditures throughout the economy. Thanks in part to the long-term impact of rising prices, the nation has become far more energy-efficient in recent decades, so high fuel prices today shouldn’t hurt as much as they once did.Figures provided by Ned Davis Research show that in December 1981, for example, energy expenditures accounted for 7.81 percent of disposable income in the United States, compared with only 5.5 percent in December 2011. Inflation-adjusted prices of gasoline were approximately the same in both periods, about $3.30 a gallon.Higher fuel efficiency may account for the relatively strong level of recent auto sales, despite higher energy prices. Consumers have been buying smaller and less gas-thirsty vehicles, auto industry executives say.What’s more, inflation in the United States is quite low at the moment — largely because of the weak economy.Yet the apparent relationship between rising gas prices and falling presidential approval ratings appears to be as strong as ever, Mr. LaForge said. “President Obama will need to be paying close attention to gasoline prices, even if they don’t have the impact they once did,” he said.'"
"'12-03-04,'0','LAST Saturday, a few hours after the Jil Sander show in Milan, a French fashion executive who had seen the fall collection online sent the following e-mail:“Difficult to see any show after Jil Sander! A real dream ... one of these moments when you understand why you have a passion for this industry.”And that same evening, the chief executive of an Italian fashion company related how he and his young daughter had recently gone into the Jil Sander boutique in Milan to see the current spring clothes up close. They, too, are fans of the designer, Raf Simons.You simply don’t hear about these kinds of reactions nowadays in the fashion world — for that matter, you don’t find many galvanizing examples of talent in other creative fields — and it’s hard to imagine an executive taking time on his day off to look at someone else’s runway show. But that’s how talented Mr. Simons is.Shortly before the Sander show, Mr. Simons was dismissed — “unceremoniously dumped,” as Bridget Foley said in Women’s Wear Daily — after seven years as creative director. Although this cold fact emerged only later, the audience knew that Mr. Simons was being replaced by the company’s founder, Jil Sander. Indeed, a lot of editors and buyers assumed he was going on to greener pastures — namely, Dior, which reportedly wanted him. Along with Chanel, Dior is the last of the truly Parisian couture houses. It’s a plum job.Still, many in the audience sensed that Mr. Simons got a raw deal from Sander’s Japanese owner, Onward Holdings, and its Italian subsidiary, Gibo. A news release had trumpeted Ms. Sander’s return (“Jil is Back!”) and that, too, felt wrong. Hadn’t Mr. Simons’s designs represented forward thinking? After watching his final show — an intimate, bare-shouldered, fully modern glimpse of femininity done in pinks, grays and browns — people stormed the Sander runway, applauding. In my experience, this was a first.For now, Mr. Simons, 44, is out of a job. (He still has his small but influential men’s line in Antwerp, Belgium, where he lives.) Because his designs for Jil Sander were greeted with an unusual degree of anticipation by the industry — he is widely credited with starting the trend for bright colors (now visible in all the red and royal blue jeans around) and bringing fresh air to iconic couture shapes — his situation is a little like that of a respected actor, a Philip Seymour Hoffman or Daniel Day-Lewis, between roles. You are eager to see what he, like them, will do with existing material or something original. As the Vogue editor in chief, Anna Wintour, a supporter of Mr. Simons, said, “We look forward to seeing what he does next.” But that’s where the similarities to film work end.'"
"'12-03-04,'0','For I.B.M., Rio is a crucible. By 2050, roughly 75 percent of the world’s population is expected to live in cities. Many metropolitan areas already use data-collection systems like sensors, video cameras and GPS devices. But advances in computing power and data analysis now make it possible for companies like I.B.M. to collate all this data and, using computer algorithms, to identify patterns and trends. Mr. Banavar calls it “sense-making software.”Running a big city, particularly one as varied as Rio, makes running many companies seem easy. No wonder the market to supply cities with “smart” systems is expected to reach $57 billion by 2014, according to IDC Government Insights, a market research firm.I.B.M. wants a piece of that. It is expanding into the local government market as part of a plan to raise its annual revenue to $150 billion or more, Mr. Banavar said. In 2011, the company’s revenue was nearly $107 billion.The Rio operations center, which opened at the end of 2010, is part of an effort to gain a toehold in a market with more established players like Cisco Systems. (Cisco calls its local government initiative “Smart+Connected Communities.” The company is heavily involved in the Songdo International Business District, a new city in South Korea, where Cisco’s network technologies help commercial buildings control energy consumption, for example.)But even for a company like I.B.M., Rio represents a grand challenge. A horizontal city sprawled between mountains and the Atlantic Ocean, it is at once a boomtown, a beach town, a paradise, an eyesore, a research center and a construction site. Oil-industry giants like Halliburton and Schlumberger have been rushing to build research centers here to help develop massive oil and gas fields off the coast.Special police units have moved into about 20 slums, called favelas, in an effort to assert government control and combat crime. Rio is also reconstructing major arenas and building a rapid-bus system ahead of the 2014 World Cup and the 2016 Summer Olympics.This is a city where some of the rich live in gated communities while some of the poor in the favelas pirate electricity from the grid. And where disasters, natural and otherwise, sometimes strike. Rainstorms can cause deadly landslides. Last year, a historic streetcar derailed, killing five people. Earlier this year, three buildings collapsed downtown, killing at least 17.The complex conditions create a kind of hothouse for I.B.M. to expand its local government business. If the company can remake Rio as a smarter city, it can remake anywhere.“Smart is all about information,” Mr. Banavar said. “Once you have the information and understand it and know what to do with it, you are halfway to smart.”AT 45, Mr. Banavar is the unofficial ambassador for Smarter Cities. He flies around the world, listening to mayors’ predicaments and overseeing the I.B.M. teams whose job is to produce the solutions. Since its start in 2010, Smarter Cities has become involved in several thousand projects.That Mr. Banavar was raised in Bangalore, India, now lives in New York and is married to a woman from Skopje, Macedonia, only bolsters I.B.M.’s global urban cred. It also helps that he embeds himself as he sizes up each city.One day last month, he stood at the central Praça da Bandeira intersection, a knot of streets and highway overpasses that connect northern Rio with the southern beach zone.“Imagine this intersection with a meter or two of water,” Mr. Banavar said. An overhead camera was streaming video to the operations center. “This becomes like a pond.”The catalyst for the operations center was a torrential summer storm here nearly two years ago. Around 4 that morning, Mayor Paes started receiving alarming reports. There were landslides in some favelas, with the risk of many more. There were flash floods. Cars and trucks were stuck in rising water. But Rio did not have a predetermined location from which the mayor could monitor the situation and oversee a response.“By then, I realized we were very weak,” Mr. Paes recounted in a phone interview. “That also made me mad.”So he improvised. He had lived in Connecticut as a teenager and remembered how some American cities declared snow days so they could clear the streets. In the wee hours, he began calling television stations, radio stations and newspapers, declaring an emergency and urging people to stay home.“We had no plans for that, but it worked,” Mr. Paes said.In the city, 68 people died as a result of the floods and landslides, but the toll might have been worse if he hadn’t issued the warning, he said.Mayor Paes decided that Rio could do better. A month later, he met with Mr. Banavar and a team from I.B.M. Like a corporate chief executive, the mayor wanted to knock down silos among his departments and combine each one’s data to help the whole enterprise.“We used to have all of this information.” Mr. Paes said. “But we could not put it together to use in a smart, intelligent way.”He wanted his new operations center to open as soon as possible.PREVIOUSLY, I.B.M. developed crime control centers for Madrid and New York City, along with a traffic congestion fee system for Stockholm. But creating a citywide, interdepartmental system for Rio was a far bigger task. I.B.M. approached the challenge like a general contractor, managing the overall project while farming out some of the work. Local companies handled construction and telecommunications. Cisco provided network infrastructure and the videoconferencing system that links the operations center to the mayor’s house. The digital screens are from Samsung.“We coordinated everything,” Mr. Banavar said. “In our terminology, we call it being the ‘master integrator.’ ”I.B.M. incorporated its hardware, software, analytics and research. It created manuals so that the center’s employees could classify problems into four categories: events, incidents, emergencies and crises. A loud party, for instance, is an event. People beating up each other at a party is an incident. A party that becomes a riot is an emergency. If someone dies in the riot, it’s a crisis. The manuals also lay out step-by-step procedures for how departments should handle pressing situations like floods and rockslides.I.B.M. also installed a virtual operations platform that acts as a Web-based clearinghouse, integrating information that comes in via phone, radio, e-mail and text message. When city employees log on, they can enter information from, say, an accident scene, or see how many ambulances have been dispatched. They can also analyze historical information to determine, for instance, where car accidents tend to occur. In addition, I.B.M. developed a custom flood forecast system for the city. Mr. Banavar even recommended that the mayor create the position of chief operating officer to oversee the operations center, and the mayor agreed.The project cost Rio about $14 million, Mayor Paes said. If it all works according to plan, it could make Rio a model of data-driven city management.“We want to put Rio ahead of every city in the world concerning operations of daily life and emergency response,” the mayor said. But, he said, the challenge will be to make the city run more efficiently without watering down the brio that makes Rio Rio. “We don’t want to be Lausanne or Zurich.”ONE evening in late January, a 20-story office building downtown next to the municipal theater collapsed, taking two other buildings along with it. Panic ensued. The operations center sprang into action.A city employee happened to be having a beer near the scene and alerted Carlos Roberto Osório, the city’s secretary of public works and conservation.“We gained one minute by luck,” Mr. Osório said. “But the system worked very well.”At the operations center, employees alerted the fire and civil defense departments and then asked the gas and electric companies to shut down service around the scene. Others temporarily closed the subway underneath the site, blocked off the street, dispatched ambulances, alerted hospitals, sent in heavy equipment to remove the rubble and activated civil guards to evacuate nearby buildings and secure the accident site. The operations center’s Twitter feed alerted followers about blocked streets and alternate routes. Mr. Osório himself sped to the scene, from which he posted photos to his own Twitter and Facebook accounts.At least 17 people died in the collapse, and city officials said later that construction work inside the 20-story building might have knocked out load-bearing walls. Still, the city’s coordinated response was a victory for the operations center. “We were never able to react so quickly before,” Mr. Osório said.In early February, Mr. Osório was standing in the noonday heat in the middle of the Sambadrome stadium, overseeing the reconstruction of the samba school parade grounds two weeks before Carnaval. The city had promised to widen the space and add thousands of seats for the Olympics. Mr. Osório wanted the work finished on time.Many other sites here are under construction. That is because, after decades of neglect, the government and private companies are heavily investing in upgrading infrastructure and services like transportation. This includes a $4.5 billion waterfront revitalization project to remake the port area as a combination residential, business and tourism zone.“There is a barrage of problems and needs,” Mr. Osório said. “We are doing too many things at once, all necessary.”Amid such changes, officials view the operations center as a stabilizing influence — and a selling point. Mr. Osório says officials are using the operations center to try to minimize inconveniences as well as to attract investment.Consider Carnaval. The biggest challenges for the city are the street performances, which involve about 425 mobile samba bands performing over four weekends at 350 different sites, Mr. Osório said. Several million people attend. With the operations center in place, the city now coordinates planning across 18 different agencies. Together, those departments assign time slots to the street bands and map their routes, as well as plan for security, street cleaning, crowd control and other needs.“In the past, each of them would do their planning separately and without talking to each other,” Mr. Osório said.Rio officials, meanwhile, have adopted Mr. Banavar as an honorary Carioca — a Rio native. Last year, Mayor Paes invited several I.B.M. executives and their wives to watch the samba schools from the mayor’s box at the Sambadrome. The Banavars sambaed until 6 a.m.ONE evening last month, a fire broke out on Visconde de Pirajá, an upscale shopping street in the Ipanema district.Some Cariocas got out their smartphones and took pictures. Just before 7 p.m., Pitty Webo, an actress who lives nearby, began alerting her Twitter followers. A few minutes later, the operations center’s Twitter feed — @operaçõesrio — reported that traffic was being diverted.Luiza Amoedo, an event planner, joined the crowd gawking at flames in an adjacent square. Glass panes cracked and crashed into the street. Fire trucks arrived and a red helicopter dropped firefighters onto the roof.Down below, it was chaos. Nobody had cordoned off the square or moved onlookers out of the hail of glass. One end of the street was closed to traffic, but on the other side, a traffic officer redirected cars around the crowd.“Rio is too far from being prepared. Nothing works,” Ms. Amoedo sighed. “It’s ridiculous. It’s the year 2012. This should not be happening.”The operations center has received a lot of publicity here and abroad. (Last week, Mayor Paes attended a TED conference in Long Beach, Calif., where he participated in a panel about cities.) The center even has an on-site press room from which the Globo television network broadcasts traffic and weather reports. And yet many inhabitants have never heard of the center or, if they have, they’re not really sure what it does.Some wonder if it is all for show, to reassure Olympic officials and foreign investors. Some worry that it will benefit well-off neighborhoods more than the favelas. Others fear that all this surveillance has the potential to curb freedoms or invade privacy. Still others view the center as a stopgap that does not address underlying infrastructure problems.At least that was the prevailing view one Sunday afternoon in Armazém Saõ Thiago, an old bar in Santa Teresa, a historic neighborhood of cobblestone streets and colonial-style houses. For more than a century, the neighborhood’s signature attraction had been its bright yellow streetcars. But last year a trolley derailed, killing five people. The transportation department for the state of Rio de Janeiro, not the city, was responsible for maintenance and has halted the trams. Above the marble bar, a poster protesting the move depicted a streetcar crying a big white tear.“The system the mayor created will resolve a problem when it happens, but it does not resolve infrastructure problems,” said Alexandre Hartz, a health insurance risk assessor who was sharing a beer with some friends. “The culture of Rio is reactionary. It is not preventive.”Try telling that to Márcio Motta, the city’s hyper-vigilant subsecretary of civil defense. Since the landslides two years ago, Rio has installed sirens, wirelessly linked to the operations center, in 66 favelas. It has also staged numerous practice drills in which volunteers have helped evacuate residents.In real flood conditions, the operations center decides when to set off the sirens. That decision is based on I.B.M.’s system, which uses computer algorithms to predict how much rain will fall in a given square kilometer — a far more precise forecast than standard weather systems provide. When the program predicts heavy rain, the center sends out text messages to different departments so they can prepare.But it’s difficult for the public to appreciate when a crisis has been averted, Mayor Paes said.“It’s not what people feel every day,” he said. “It’s the problems that could happen that don’t happen every day.”CAN I.B.M. turn small government into big business? You could think of Rio as a high-level science project from the same company that built Watson, the computer that plays “Jeopardy.” It is certainly good P.R. Seven years after I.B.M. stopped selling personal computers, such projects might help keep the company in the popular psyche.But I.B.M. is hoping that mayors the world over will develop Rio envy. To that end, the company has just introduced a product called the I.B.M. Intelligent Operations Center, which combines a number of the systems that were designed for Rio into a single product.Think of it as a smart city in a box.“Previously, you’d have to buy 12 different pieces and get services to integrate it,” Mr. Banavar explained. “Now you can do it in one shot.”Some cities are already interested. Late last month, I.B.M. said Zhenjiang, a city of about three million people in eastern China, had bought the new system to manage public transportation. It also bought a custom analytics program to help predict and alleviate traffic jams along bus routes.And it is not just cities: the Miami Dolphins football team just bought the packaged product to manage visitor traffic at its 75,000-seat Sun Life Stadium.I.B.M. expects its Smarter Planet unit, which includes the Smarter Cities business, to have revenue of $10 billion by 2015.IT was 11:30 p.m. on a Tuesday at Carioca da Gema, a popular samba bar in the Lapa neighborhood here. Mr. Banavar’s Brazilian colleagues from the local I.B.M. office had gone home, but he wasn’t yet ready to turn in. Sitting in the balcony overlooking the dance floor, he was dissecting the bands he had just heard.Like a city or a multinational corporation, a samba band involves a lot of moving parts: musicians, singers, instruments, equipment, compositions, lyrics, improvisations — not to mention its audience. In Mr. Banavar’s view, the warm-up band had been in sync, but the singers in the headline band seemed out of whack.To this I.B.M.-er, everything could use a better system, even a samba band. And, the more complex the problem, the more valuable the solution.“I come from I.B.M. research. I’m attracted to large, complex systems,” Mr. Banavar said. “Can you think of a system that is more complex than a city?”'"
"'12-03-04,'0','Michigan’s last Big Ten regular-season title came in 1986, its lone N.C.A.A. championship in 1989. Michigan was runner-up for the national title in 1992 and 1993, but those achievements were vacated because of N.C.A.A. violations.The Wolverines have reached the N.C.A.A. tournament twice since Beilein arrived from West Virginia, losing in the second round both times.The under-construction meme is metaphor and reality for Michigan. Beilein’s spacious, bright office in the recently opened William Davidson Player Development Center faces a construction site.The $24.5 million complex, which contains practice courts, offices and training facilities for the men’s and women’s basketball teams, is only a piece of a bigger project.A $54 million plan will expand 44-year-old Crisler Center, with a private club, improved areas for fans and more retail space. The first phase of the renovation replaced the seats, scoreboard, infrastructure and roof of the facility last year.Michigan’s investment in the arena, and by proxy the basketball team, is taken as a vote of confidence by the players and members of the basketball staff. The Wolverines nearly went undefeated this season at Crisler, ending up at 15-1 after losing to Purdue last Saturday.“I never could have imagined this when I came here,” the senior guard Zack Novak said. “It’s like Christmas every day, having a great place to practice and play, all the fan support, and we’re working hard and getting the wins.“We’ve all had our hearts broken here, so we really appreciate things we’re getting and how they’re coming to us. It’s setting us up for even bigger successes now and in the future.”The Wolverines think they are on equal footing, on and off the court, with their archrival Michigan State. While Michigan’s program fell apart on and off the court, Michigan State surged under Tom Izzo. The Spartans, who have clinched at least a share of the Big Ten title, have put together a deep legacy since 1994: winning the 2000 N.C.A.A. tournament and reaching six Final Fours while collecting seven regular-season Big Ten championships.In his early days at Michigan, Beilein made a trip to Michigan State to tour its basketball facilities. He said he was impressed by the practice courts, office space and meeting rooms for the men’s and women’s teams.“I was told Crisler was old, but I thought it looked fine until I saw what Michigan State had,” Beilein said. “That really opened my eyes that we needed to do something.”The renovated Crisler Center’s now matches the Spartans’ Breslin Center, and the basketball tide could be turning. Michigan has beaten Michigan State in three of their past four meetings.“We notice that people aren’t talking about us yet,” the sophomore shooting guard Tim Hardaway Jr. said. “We turn on the TV and hear ESPN talking about Ohio State and Michigan State, and that’s fine. We’re the underdogs. We’re going to take care of that by winning, and we feel we’re a team that could win the national championship this year. We believe.”Hardaway and the freshman point guard Trey Burke have become an explosive backcourt combination. Novak and his fellow senior Stu Douglass provide the toughness and calm underpinning Michigan’s play this year.“I never saw myself as a leader, but I grew into it and I really like being that person on the floor,” said Douglass, whom Beilein described as the team’s Dalai Lama for the way he quietly counsels younger teammates. “I think we’ve all grown and gotten better. I see where we’ve come from and this is the best team I’ve been on here.”There is a clear, easy chemistry between the players and the coaching staff, with plenty of friendly ribbing and laughs during film sessions and practices. Beilein awarded Burke a maize-and-blue sledgehammer during a recent film session, signifying commendable defense and rebounding in a 67-55 overtime win over Northwestern on Feb. 21.The sledgehammer was awarded with the playing of M C Hammer’s “U Can’t Touch This” video on the screen in the room, eliciting a little shimmy from Beilein and a bigger one from Burke with his sledgehammer. Laughs rang out from every player and coach before everyone got back to business.The assistant Bacari Alexander has been trying to share a little of the Michigan attitude online, through his Twitter account. He has written more than 12,000 entries in two years at Michigan, with more than 5,100 followers getting his “Wolverine Revolution”-themed posts.“What I am saying on Twitter is more than a slogan or attitude; it’s who we are,” Alexander said. “We’ve been changing everything we do to get better, and having this social media side is part of it. Anything we can do to convey how Michigan is evolving, and to be a positive force of change, is what we are about. Michigan basketball is being rebuilt, we are coming back, and we’re going to take it to new places.”'"
"'12-03-04,'0','As a result, the relationship between many borrowers and lenders is softening from outright animosity to something that more resembles a détente.Michelle Murray-Clark is one of the beneficiaries — or so she calls herself on a good day. A grocery clerk who found work last month after three years of unemployment, Ms. Murray-Clark has not made a payment in 40 months. Servicing, the loan processor, has not taken steps to evict her and is working on a third attempt at a .The company is also paying on her little house with the blue aluminum siding near downtown Orlando. They talk every week.“Our whole philosophy is that it’s beneficial to keep people in their homes — better for the consumer, the investors, and for us,” said Philippa Brown, the vice president for corporate communications at American Home Mortgage Servicing. “Our job is to work with homeowners who are experiencing hardship and find ways that will keep them in their homes. We’re open to new ways of doing things.”Guy D. Cecala, the publisher of Inside Mortgage Finance, an industry newsletter, explained: “Are you better off leaving a defaulted borrower in there if they’re at least maintaining the property? A lot of times, the answer is yes.”Many wonder why it has taken the banks and loan servicers so long to adapt. Andrae Bailey, executive director of the Community Food and Outreach Center in Orlando, said, “We are seeing lenders start to work with families in a way that would have made sense in 2008.” But he worries that because so many neighborhoods have already deteriorated, “it’s too little too late.”These days, some banks announce their willingness to compromise to keep houses occupied. Vickee Adams, a spokeswoman in the home mortgage division of , said, “To the point of folks remaining in their homes, there is a benefit to keeping a community active with residents.”Other lenders are often reluctant to discuss such arrangements because of questions of fairness that are inevitably raised: why should defaulting homeowners get a break?The slowing of a process that was widely seen as out of control has been a welcome relief to many borrowers who are likely to be in economic distress as a result of long-term unemployment or underemployment, experts say. But interviews with several homeowners who have had lengthy stays in their homes after defaulting show that the impact on their lives is both a blessing and a curse.“Sometimes I wake up in a foul mood,” said Ms. Murray-Clark, 52. “The mortgage company, they say, ‘We’re going to work with you,’ so I stop packing. Then they say, ‘Sorry, it didn’t work,’ and I start packing. Then they say, ‘Let’s try again!’ And I stop packing.”“I know that this is way long for anybody to be in their house,” she said.But every day, questions nag: Should she save her first paycheck to pay for movers, or should she make repairs to the roof? If the latest attempt at a loan modification comes through, how will she pay for the accumulated interest and penalties?“It’s very tense, because I don’t know what’s going to happen,” she said.Judith Fox, a law professor who directs the Economic Justice Project at the Notre Dame Law Center in South Bend, Ind., has changed the advice she gives defaulting clients. “Three or four years ago, I would always tell clients, ‘You have three or four months to get yourself together,’ ” she said. “Now I tell folks, even if they’ve been foreclosed, ‘Just stay put, because it could be years before anything happens.’ ”One of Ms. Fox’s clients is Nicholas Cline, 35, a construction worker who fell behind on his mortgage payments in 2009. (He thought he had modified his loan, but the company he was working with has since pleaded guilty to criminal fraud.) The bank that holds Mr. Cline’s mortgage has left him alone, he said. No letters, no calls, no hassles.“But now that it’s going on three years, what do you do?” Mr. Cline said. “I am living in my house. But the stress of this, not knowing what’s going to happen or when, it’s an unbelievable burden on your mind.”In New York, the time to complete a foreclosure has almost quadrupled, from 263 days in 2007 to 1,019 days in 2011. Abraham Kleinman, a lawyer in Uniondale who represents homeowners fighting foreclosure, said he counseled a client who felt guilty about remaining in his home so long after defaulting. “He says to himself, ‘I’m sitting here rent free, it can’t go on forever,’ ” Mr. Kleinman said. “But the plaintiff has not been aggressive. As near as I can tell, they’ve put this to the side.”'"
"'12-03-04,'0','Wyn Hornbuckle, a Justice Department spokesman, said the deal with private plaintiffs leaves much to be done. “We are pleased that BP may be stepping up to address harms to individual plaintiffs, but this by no means fully addresses its responsibility for the harms it has caused,” he said.Nothing in the Friday deal, Mr. Hornbuckle said, “compensates the public for the significant damages to its natural resources and environment, and BP has yet to pay a penalty for its violations of law.”In a statement on Friday, he said, “Although we remain open to a fair and just settlement, we are fully prepared to try the case.”Kenneth R. Feinberg, who has administered BP’s compensation fund, praised the deal, calling it “good news,” and saying “it avoids a lengthy, complex trial and uncertain appeals.”Mr. Feinberg, whose fund has evaluated more than one million claims from nearly 600,000 people and businesses, has paid out $6.1 billion to more than 225,000 of them. He urged “an orderly transition to the new proposed claims program.”Whether that transition will be orderly is another of the open questions. In some ways, delays that often occur in such settlements will be minimized: while defendants in class actions usually do not pay out settlements until final approval by the court, BP has agreed to continue paying claims throughout the process.Still, elements of the rough outlines of the proposal before the judge already have some plaintiffs’ lawyers grumbling. Anyone who currently has an offer of settlement payment from the Feinberg fund will receive only 60 percent of that money right away, and will have to join the broader lawsuit to receive the rest, though plaintiffs will then be able to choose the original offer if they prefer.“Under the new program, eligible claimants will generally be paid greater benefits” than under the current claims facility, said Stephen J. Herman and James P. Roy, who serve as liaison counsel for the plaintiffs.In an interview, Mr. Herman said, “We appreciate everything Mr. Feinberg tried to do. It was a challenging situation. But it’s time for a new program.“We’re hoping that there won’t be that many bumps in the road and the claims process will be much improved.”Daniel E. Becnel Jr., a Louisiana lawyer who has chosen to move most of his clients through the Feinberg fund, expressed skepticism about that element of the deal, saying that it seemed that the goal of the new process was to siphon more people into the settlement process. “It looks like it’s all about fees,” he said, and he predicted, “You’re going to have a lot of opt-outs.”Under the proposed agreement, fees for work already done by the plaintiffs’ team are expected to be paid by BP and will not come from individual plaintiffs, though those plaintiffs might be billed for additional work in preparing their claims.Initial business reaction to the proposed deal was positive. “It’s a good thing for BP because it is a good step forward,” said Nancy T. Schmitt, president and partner at Taum Sauk Capital Management, a hedge fund.“It took Exxon 20 years to settle the Exxon Valdez,” she added. “It looks like a fair deal and a step in the right direction. And, as an investor, that’s what you want to see.”Some, however, said they would have been happier to see the case go to trial, where the mistakes and decisions that led to the gulf disaster could be brought to light.Brian Moore, the legislative director of the National Audubon Society, said, “It’s the largest Clean Water Act violation we’ve seen in our nation — maybe those things should be talked about publicly, and not privately.”'"
"'12-03-04,'0','Hundreds of lawyers, victims’ families and survivors of the wreck of the cruise ship Costa Concordia, which capsized off the Tuscan coast in January, converged on Grosseto, Italy, on Saturday for the first evidence hearing in the criminal investigation against the ship’s captain and others.So many people had the right to attend that prosecutors had to move the hearing from the courthouse to a 1,000-seat theater. More than 4,230 people are considered parties in the case, and there were more than 50 lawyers at the hearing on Saturday.The giant cruise ship with about 4,200 passengers aboard hit a rock off the Tuscan island of Giglio, tearing a gash in the hull and partly sinking the ship, killing 32 people.The main order of business on Saturday was to appoint experts to analyze data from the ship’s recording devices, including the black box.Prosecutors hope the recordings will help pinpoint the actions of the ship’s captain between the time of the impact and the evacuation order, which was given more than an hour later. Prosecutors have argued in preliminary documents that the crew delayed the evacuation.The ship’s captain, Cmdr. Francesco Schettino, is under house arrest near Naples on preliminary charges of manslaughter, neglecting to report the accident to port authorities, causing a shipwreck and abandoning ship before passengers were taken to safety. Captain Schettino did not attend the hearing because he was not required to, one of his lawyers said.'"
"'12-03-04,'0','The seven Dietrich-von Sternberg movies form a unified whole, but within the series von Sternberg systematically works variations in theme and style. With the exception of her lowdown Berlin cabaret singer, Lola Lola, in the “The Blue Angel,” a figure of pure malevolence (she revels in humiliating her older lover, a once-respected schoolmaster played by Emil Jannings), Dietrich’s characters function both as objects of desire (her face drinks in light like a Brancusi sculpture) and agents of desire, in the grip of consuming, concentrated loves that frequently demand pain or martyrdom. Von Sternberg places this complex figure into many different contexts, from street prostitute (“Dishonored”) to absolute monarch (“The Scarlet Empress”). He even tries, with mixed success, to imagine her as an ordinary, middle-class wife and mother (“Blonde Venus”).The theme of “Dishonored” is death: it’s virtually the only topic the characters discuss, and at the end of the film we discover that the secret trajectory of the Dietrich character, a Mata Hari-like spy known only as “X-27,” has been toward suicide by firing squad. The compositions tend to uncluttered close-ups; there is relatively little movement within the frame; and the dominant tonality is inky darkness, with individual figures picked out by glaring, overhead spotlights.In a sense the film is an inversion of “The Blue Angel,” this time with Dietrich playing the Jannings character (a cultured past is suggested by her concert-level abilities as a pianist), now throwing herself at the feet of the crude sensualist played by Victor McLaglen, a crowing Russian colonel who lives only for excitement. In the end she gives up her life for this shallow, thuggish man and in doing so finds fulfillment.“Shanghai Express,” by contrast, is one of the few comedies in the von Sternberg canon, at least in the sense that it has a happy ending and is shaped by some wonderfully droll dialogue by Jules Furthman. (“It took more than one man to change my name to Shanghai Lily.”) Here the surface of the screen is always abuzz with back and forth movements (systematically lateral, to imitate the movement of the train that gives the film its title), interposed foreground objects and various kinds of filters (veils, clouds of steam, dirty windows, dense patterns of shadow) that interrupt the direct access to the characters offered by “Dishonored.” We are left instead with a world of appearances, almost all of them false: hardly anyone on this crowded train, making its troubled way through revolutionary territory from Peiping (as it was then called) to Shanghai, is who he or she first seems to be.In “Shanghai Express” the challenge will be for Lily and her ex-lover, a British medical officer played by Clive Brook, to clear away these cobwebs of perception and see each other for who they really are — for von Sternberg a task of immense difficulty and one his characters rarely accomplish. “Blonde Venus” ends with an image of the Dietrich character’s young son, reaching out through the bars of his crib and trying to touch a dangling toy that just eludes his grasp; so goes the search for authenticity in Sternberg’s world of glittering surfaces.

"'12-03-04,'0','The exhibition is chronological, and the early years are a story of big dreams and failed schemes for replacing the ferries and railroad barges that got people and goods across the Hudson until the early 20th century. On display here is the 1895 cornerstone for the proposed North River Bridge, and a rendering of what might have been: a fearsome-looking rail span, 14 tracks wide, that would have left a broad swath of Hoboken in perpetual shadow.The first tunnels for passenger trains under the river opened in 1908, but then came another problem: how to accommodate all the new motor vehicles that were beginning to fill the roads. A bridge seemed the most logical answer, but was also, at an estimated $42 million, the most costly. A tunnel would be far cheaper, $11 million, and would gobble much less land, but would also be more difficult to engineer.Planning dawdled until the arctic winter of 1917-18, when the Hudson froze, and coal was stranded on the New Jersey docks while New Yorkers shivered. The ice eventually melted, and so did opposition. After much political wrangling, New York and New Jersey managed to reach an agreement, choose as the chief engineer the young Clifford M. Holland — whose plan for two tubes won out over the single-tube plan promoted by the venerable George Washington Goethals, builder of the Panama Canal — and start digging.“If they had not figured out a way to handle the ventilation system,” Dr. Jackson said, referring to the method of dealing with the exhaust fumes from motor vehicles, “the tunnel wouldn’t have worked, and prior to the Holland Tunnel they had not figured that out.”Four tall ventilation towers circulate air under the roadways and back out, keeping it cleaner in the tunnel, as measured by tests at the time, than in Midtown Manhattan — a solution devised by Ole Singstad, who went on to design several other tunnels, including the Lincoln. “The solution was so elegant and perfect that it’s been copied in virtually every vehicular tunnel built since,” said Dr. Jackson, an urban planner from Texas who holds a Ph.D. in American civilization and has written widely on the history of engineering projects in the United States.Construction of the tunnel cost at least 13 lives; a 14th was the chronically stressed and overworked Mr. Holland himself, who died just two days before the eastward tunneling crew and the westward tunneling crew met beneath the river for the momentous “hole through” in 1924. “It did wear on him, and unfortunately drove him to his grave,” Mr. Webster said.His tunnel was quickly named for him. “It’s extremely unusual to have a work of heroic civil engineering named after the engineer,” said Angus Kress Gillespie, a professor of American studies at Rutgers University whose recent book “Crossing Under the Hudson” recounts the history of both the Holland and Lincoln Tunnels and was, along with Dr. Jackson’s book, a source of both inspiration and information for the Hoboken exhibition. Dr. Gillespie is scheduled to give a talk at the museum on March 4 at 4 p.m.The toll was 50 cents when it opened, and the old traffic graphs hanging in the exhibition show that it was an immediate hit, soon carrying 35 million vehicles a year. Plans were quickly made for another tunnel, which was originally known as the Midtown Holland Tunnel.“The way I kind of see it is that the Lincoln Tunnel is the son of Holland,” Dr. Gillespie said. “It’s kind of frightening, the thought of going underneath the river, and the powers that be were afraid that people wouldn’t accept it.”Because the Holland had solved the engineering problems of a vehicular tunnel, the new tunnel, it was thought, would be easier to build. But what the Holland had not solved were the financial problems. The first tube of the Lincoln Tunnel opened in 1937; the third did not open until 20 years later.Near the end of the exhibition in Hoboken is its prize artifact: one of the narrow electric cars that used to carry police officers along the catwalk that borders the roadway in the Holland Tunnel. The catwalk car was the fastest, surest way through the tunnel, gliding blithely past the most epic traffic jams — equipped with no horn, because none was needed — but, alas, it was taken out of service last spring.'"

"'12-03-04,'0','Right now the area around Kep is still in that traveler’s sweet spot — mostly itself, but with roads and a few boutique hotels here and there for those who want them.Yet as I would see over the course of two weeks, change is afoot. The crowds will surely be coming, but before they do I wanted a chance to see it for myself.JUST a few hours from , the country’s capital, Kep started out as a stylish retreat for the French in the 1920s, and by 1960 was called the of Southeast Asia (Kep-sur-Mer), with modernist colonial villas built along the coast and weekenders arriving in vintage convertibles. When the Khmer Rouge set up camp here in the 1970s the French beat a retreat, and the villas fell into disrepair.In the last five years, however, a number of these structures have been turned into boutique hotels — properties like Villa Romonea, which opened in 2010, and , which opened a few years before.Villa Romonea was the dream second home of a Khmer woman who built the house in 1968 with the help of a famous local architect, Lu Ban Hap. It was the last villa built before the war, and the owner and her husband, a pharmacist, were killed in the early days of the regime. Now British developers have taken over.The six-room hotel with its saltwater infinity pool and tropical grounds is representative of the kind of small-scale enterprises that have been spreading across southwestern Cambodia. Many are run by foreigners who discovered the area early on and wanted an excuse to stay. Jef Moons, Knai Bang Chatt’s Belgian owner, first saw Kep in 2003 while on a vacation. He then proceeded to buy a -influenced villa, which he restored initially into a vacation home and then, in 2006 — a hotel. “I first fell in love with the people in Cambodia,” Mr. Moons said, “but also with the nature. It still feels remote.”Over the course of my stay last year, I tried out both hotels. Each, set along the tranquil rocky coast, proved difficult to leave. One could camp out for days, sitting at waterfront tables watching the boats pass by and taking brief strolls into town. They were also incredibly good spots to be with a baby; everyone from cooks to hotel managers treated my son like a visiting celebrity.But I was eager to explore the surrounding countryside, in particular the inland region to the northwest and the beaches and islands up the coast — areas, I had been told, whose futures were already being plotted by Chinese, Russian and Cambodian conglomerates eager to make their mark.Our first trip was to Kampot, about an hour away. One can arrange to hire a car and driver but we decided to rent motorcycles. After leaving the baby in capable hands at Knai Bang Chatt, we sputtered along, passing countless oxen knee deep in rice paddies, bustling markets and clusters of little villages made up of traditional stilt houses.Decades-old Camrys seem to be the local car of choice (I noticed one with plates), which shared the road with an assortment of scooters, and vans that double as buses, not to mention the water buffalo, chickens and pigs that shuffled about amid the traffic.In Kampot, a quiet city set alongside pepper plantations and forested hills, we drank at one of the cafes that have sprouted in the crumbling 1920s verandas that front the lazy Praek Teuk Chhu River. Kampot was once one of the country’s most important ports, and is still the center of Cambodia’s pepper production; its streets are lined with turn-of-the-century colonial buildings, now mostly in disrepair.As we sat watching boats make their way along the river, we were again struck by the startling lack of hawking here — especially compared with many tourist towns in and .Another observation: There were few people in their 40s, 50s and 60s. The reason for this speaks to the horrifying fact that between 1975 and 1979 a fifth of the population was wiped out under the regime. The Khmer Rouge endured in Kampot through much of the , much later than other parts of the country, and almost every person I met lost at least one close family member or friend.Despite this, a sense of unrelenting friendliness pervaded. As we meandered around the neighborhoods behind the riverfront, no one seemed to register our difference except maybe by giving us a wave.But the sleepy atmosphere of Kampot belied the busy construction going on above, in the old mountain retreat of Bokor.Almost a hundred years ago, about 20 miles from Kampot in the cool mountains of Preah Monivong , the French created a summer escape from the intense heat of the capital and plains below, with a hotel, casino, post office and church. The mammoth, once-opulent buildings of marble and timber were initially abandoned in the 1940s during the first Indochina war and then again in the 1970s when the Khmer Rouge took them over.More recently, according to Stephane Arrii, the Villa Romonea’s manager, they were the site of clandestine New Year’s parties, with expatriates and Cambodians dancing together in the spooky bullet-riddled ruins of the former casino with its graffiti-covered walls and echoing drawing rooms. travelers would take daylong hikes through the jungle or suffer the bumpy roads in 4x4s to see the dilapidated icon.When I was there a year ago, however, it took quite a lot of maneuvering to arrange a visit, as the area is once again the object of a developer’s dreams. Sokimex, Cambodia’s oil and banking company, along with its hospitality division, Sokha Hotels & Resorts, is redeveloping the area and is busily creating access roads. After multiple calls Ms. Arrii was finally able to arrange for a guide to take a couple of Belgian and me to see the work in progress (though it wasn’t until a park ranger gave us the final go-ahead that we were assured access).The route, once almost impassable in a car, was being turned into a multilane paved road that has now been completed. It snakes through forests that are reputedly teeming with rare birds and animals — including, some say, Cambodia’s last tigers. And even though we went on a Sunday, construction was moving at a furious pace, with young men paving the remaining miles up to the top. To keep efficiency at a maximum, temporary encampments had been set up along the way. Toddlers wandered about; lines of washing hung outside trailers.As we made our way farther into the hills, the bright sun of the coast turned to fog; soon we couldn’t see more than a few feet in front of the jeep.  Finally, the outline of two hulking structures came into view — the casino and the church. Out of the car we were able to freely explore, peering in to see what looked like acres of elaborate mosaic floors, mostly smashed. An unending chorus of bird calls wafted up from the jungle below.Plans for a casino, a cable car, an golf course and 652 guest rooms all seemed improbable when I saw the site, but construction has moved quickly. The hotel is scheduled to open this season and work is under way at the casino.MEANWHILE, thanks to Cambodia’s wealth of not only history but natural beauty, ambitious plans are simultaneously unrolling up the coast to the north.Before I had come, a friend had written to me about the coastline: “The sand is like snow and there are miles of crystal-clear-water beachfront with nothing there.”In other words, unlike the oceanfront in Kep, which is mostly rocky, the sandy coast to the north is resort-ready, and resort owners have taken notice. Not that it’s entirely deserted. There are simple seafront villages along the coast on some of the bigger islands. Populated by fishermen and their families as well as people from nonprofits there to teach about sustainable fishing practices (and English), the ramshackle outposts are a colorful part of any visit here.To get a more intimate sense of the landscape, my friend put us in touch with Claude Du Dinh Tan, a Franco-Vietnamese man who rents a small collection of bungalows in the hills above and leads dive excursions.As we chugged around the islands and the mainland’s coastline in his small motorboat, Mr. Du Tinh Tan, who arrived here in 1992, did not try to conceal his feelings about the planned development. “It is forbidden to build concrete hotels on the beach,” he pointed out, as we drove by what was at the time an almost-completed concrete tower sitting on a prime piece of beachfront. “But it seems like local officials are just turning a blind eye to this kind of site.”The suggestion that developers are playing fast and loose with a pristine area was echoed throughout the day as we toured the hundreds of islands, many of them marked by a single, unassuming flag indicating some sort of ownership or planned development.One of the closest to Sihanoukville, Snake Island, was recently connected to the mainland by a large concrete bridge that was forced to close soon after it was opened because parts of it were buckling. A Russian company apparently has plans to populate the island with a resort, a yacht club and shopping centers.Luckily (and thanks in large part to the global financial meltdown of the last few years) the more egregious development plans seem to be moving slowly. Except for the bridge and the concrete hotel, Cambodia’s version of a on the beach still exists only on paper. The few projects that have been realized, like the recently opened Saa on the island of Koh Rong, tend to be high-end and lower-impact — 27 luxury villas mixed with an emphasis on sustainability and community participation.In the meantime, there are still too-good-to-be-true budget places. We stopped at one of them, called Angkor Chum, on the southwestern part of Koh Rong, for a meal on the way back to Kep: $15 (American dollars are accepted all over Cambodia) a day covers a beachfront bungalow at the edge of a secluded cove reached only by boat; meals of crab, squid and barbecued fish are served to order at a bare-bones dockside restaurant.IT is hard not to see a piece of haunting history like Bokor or the unspoiled islands off the coast of Sihanoukville and not want them to stay like that forever — for your eyes only.But Cambodia has other needs, too. The average family makes the equivalent of only $2,100 a year, and development can put money in their pockets. On one of my last excursions I went to visit a resort that is attempting to serve the triple needs of tourists, locals and the land itself. Specifically, we headed to the Retreat, a hotel and restaurant that opened a couple of years ago on a working pepper plantation close to Kep.The owner, David Pred, found the plantation by Chamcar Bei village, now the site of the Vine, through his work with Bridges Across Borders, an organization that has, among other things, established a local school and health clinic.Overlooking pepper fields, the property is lovely, with a few beautifully decorated rooms that cost less than $50 a night. After a meal of curry and fresh juice at the hotel’s organic restaurant, we visited the school, passing kids on bikes who called out to our toddler. Without the school, which opened its doors in 2007, Mr. Pred said, the children would be working on family farms.Later, I spoke to him about the dual impulses of progress and preservation. “Aid groups alone are not going to be able to lift Cambodians out of poverty,” he said, “but I wanted to demonstrate that it is possible to do business here in a way that is profitable, and at the same time benefits the local community and leaves as faint a footprint as possible on the environment.”With a little luck, projects like this that mix hospitality with community initiatives will flourish along this changing coastline and create alternatives to huge resorts.I certainly hope to find him here when I come back. Having seen Koh Samui and other Southeast Asian islands before developers set in, I know what can be lost when a place is found.'"
"'12-03-04,'0','“It’s possible to make books of a certain fascination,” Thornton Wilder once said, “if you scrupulously leave out the essential.” Wilder was commenting on “The Education of Henry Adams,” that masterly autobiography in which Adams purposefully excluded any direct mention of his wife, Clover, their marriage or her shocking suicide. In fact, posterity has occasionally hinted that Adams was partly responsible for Clover’s death, as if omitting her from “The Education” suggests guilt rather than a surfeit of feeling. Adams did tell a friend that the “great calamities in life leave one speechless,” and three years after Clover died he wrote that he was still “sad, sad, sad.” He then burned some of the diaries he kept during his marriage. If Clover left a suicide note, he must have burned that too. “Wisdom,” he declared, “is silence.”For biographers, though, silence is seductive. Absent sources stir speculation. And the latest biography of Clover Adams, melodramatically subtitled “A Gilded and Heartbreaking Life,” takes the idea of loss as the theme of her story. To Natalie Dyk­stra, the life of Marian Hooper (nicknamed Clover) was founded in grief and early sorrow, and in a touch of madness.Although Clover’s maternal grandfather, a China trader, was one of the richest men in Boston, her maternal grandmother sealed herself off to pace in a darkened room after the death of her only son. Clover’s mother, who had published poetry in the Transcendentalist magazine The Dial, died of consumption in 1848 when her daughter was 5. A favorite aunt drank arsenic when Clover was 9. “Crazy as coots,” was the way Henry Adams’s brother described the family. Clover’s sister would later walk into the path of an oncoming train, and her brother would fall or throw himself out of a third-story window. In retrospect, Clover’s troubled life, with its early death, seems a foregone conclusion.Though Dykstra wants to narrate Clover’s story as she lived it, her suicide shades every gesture, every mood, every lacuna in her short life. (She died at 42.) Yet Clover was well educated, athletic and intelligent. Her vocation, as befitted her class and kind, was marriage. In 1872, at 28, she wed Henry Adams, who had recently given up his position as a Washington journalist to edit the North American Review and teach medieval history at Harvard. It was a good match: he was the grandson and great-grandson of presidents; she was the devoted daughter of an ophthalmologist whose own father presided over the largest bank in Marblehead, Mass. Clover and Henry were witty, intrigued by power and in love. Henry James called her a “perfect Voltaire in petticoats”; later her husband would be hailed as the American Voltaire.Both the Adamses were racked by self-doubt. During their yearlong honeymoon, which included a trip on the Nile, Clover seems to have fallen apart. Dykstra attributes the apparent breakdown to the fact that Clover was desperately missing the one man she truly adored: “The anchoring love of her father must have seemed a million miles away.” Clover recovered, and the Adamses returned to Boston with 25 crates of china, glass, paintings, linen and mementos: this was the gilded part of the heartbreaking life.After Henry resigned from Harvard in 1877, the couple rented a place in Washington with a view of the White House. Late in the day, after Henry finished working on his histories, he and his wife entertained guests at tea. Clover was the consummate hostess, her invitations highly sought. But Henry James noted, in a story inspired by the Adamses, that their circle “left out, on the whole, more people than it took in.”'"
"'12-03-04,'0','I was deeply moved by Geoff Dyer’s well-crafted Reading Life essay (“Next Time, Try ‘Unflagging,’ ” Feb. 19) about the dead-as-a-doornail words “tireless” and “tirelessly.” I thoroughly agree that there is no way in the world to breathe life back into them. With the greatest respect, however, might I humbly suggest that it may have been close to a crying shame that Dyer himself trotted out “thoroughly brilliant,” “brilliantly thorough,” “thoroughly exhausted” and “thoroughly used up” all on the, er, same page. Unless he did it to make mischief, as wouldn’t by any stretch of the imagination be a complete surprise.P.S. Dyer wonders if there are other thoroughly debased single words. I humbly suggest “iconic.”DANIEL MENAKERNew YorkThe writer is the former editor in chief of Random House and the author, most recently, of “A Good Talk: The Story and Skill of Conversation.”Geoff Dyer fixates on the perfectly inoffensive adjective “tireless” and hies off in search of uses of the word to shore up his argument that it is shopworn to the point of meaninglessness. I’d suggest that as there are only 26 letters in the English alphabet, there are similarly only a finite number of words in the English language, and good writers use them as purposefully as they can manage to. I’m sure I could go hunting for uses of the alternative, “unflagging,” and then choose to be impressed by its infinite appearances in English prose. It’s not that hard to find what one is looking for, if what one is looking for is as common as a common modifier.One could, I suppose, easily rap out a series of such articles on alleged word exhaustion: I’d start with “brilliant,” which, at least from my perspective, has been ground by overuse (especially, you’ll pardon me, in book reviews) into sheer pointlessness. (And I’m not even addressing its knee-jerk use in England: “I’m off to do my laundry.” “Oh, brilliant!”)BENJAMIN DREYERNew YorkThe writer is executive managing editor and copy chief of the Random House Publishing Group.I realize that Geoff Dyer’s essay on the overuse of “tirelessly” concerned books — and those in most cases by otherwise good writers. But I can’t resist pointing out in this election season — which seems endless if not tireless — that Michele Bachmann attracted unwanted attention by asserting that the founding fathers “worked tirelessly” to end slavery.This exercise in unintended irony adds new meaning to the word “tirelessly,” since the founding fathers, many of whom were slave owners, protected slavery in the Constitution and worked, perhaps even when they were tired, to maintain slavery as the law of the land.'"
"'12-03-04,'0','Most airline apps (except Southwest’s) let you view and change your seat assignment if a better seat opens. Delta, United and American also let you monitor your standby status (Delta and United track upgrades, too) and save a digital boarding pass on your phone. That last option has met with mixed reviews among travelers — myself included — since airport scanners sometimes have trouble reading the bar code on mobile boarding passes.But even if you print a boarding pass later, an app lets you check in 24 hours before your flight, no matter where you are. Before a recent Delta flight, the airline’s app even popped up an alert on my iPhone reminding me it was time to check in.TRACKING A FLIGHT One of the most useful features the airlines apps offer is a way to track flights, although some carriers are still working on proactively sending alerts to the phone’s home screen rather than making customers navigate through the app to find out whether a flight is on time. Still, using an app is more convenient than calling the airline’s automated system to check a flight’s status; in some cases, the app gives you more information.On the way to the airport before my Delta flight, I used the flight status feature on Delta’s app and could see that even though my flight was listed as “on time,” the incoming plane was running late. I figured that meant my flight would take off late (which it did), and decided there was time to run an errand on the way to the airport.Airline apps are especially handy when you have a connection: once your first flight lands, you can look up the gate number and status of your next flight while you’re taxiing to the terminal, rather than waiting until you get off the plane and find an electronic billboard.Although most airlines let customers sign up for e-mail or text alerts about flight delays, these notifications can be hit or miss (depending on how often the carrier decides to send them). JetBlue’s new app sends flight alerts to the iPhone’s home screen, saving passengers the extra step of looking for an update; other airlines say they’re working on similar “push” notifications.MONITORING YOUR LUGGAGE Delta is ahead of the pack in offering a novel feature on its app: the ability to track your checked bag, much as you can a package. Once you check your bag and get a receipt at the airport, you can select the “Track My Bags” feature on Delta’s app, which will guide you through using your phone’s camera to scan the bar code on your baggage receipt (or you can enter the bag tag number instead). From there, the app lets you see where your bag is within Delta’s system.“It will show that the bag has been received for check-in, inducted into the baggage system, scanned planeside or is at baggage carousel No. 4,” said Paul Skrbec, a Delta spokesman.You can also use Delta’s app to pay for your bag if you check in with your phone, then drop off your luggage and get a receipt once you get to the airport.NAVIGATING THE AIRPORT Another useful feature airline apps offer is airport maps, and for now United is the leader. Its app includes detailed maps for more than 100 airports, and that alone makes it worth downloading, even if you’re not flying United.Once you select an airport, you can zoom in on the map to see not only where various gates are, but also where you can find baggage claim locations, airline clubs, rental car counters, a , a bookstore and other retailers and restaurants.American offers maps for just six airports, and they only display gate numbers, not the amenities available, although Matt Miller, an American spokesman, said that an app update, which is due in the coming months, would include detailed maps for more than 80 airports. Delta’s 26 maps are relatively basic — they don’t show retailers or specific gate numbers — but Mr. Skrbec said improvements are in the works.Henry Harteveldt, a travel analyst and co-founder of the Atmosphere Research Group, expects that airlines and airports will ultimately use these mapping tools and the devices’ geo-targeting capabilities to send special offers to travelers — like a coupon for a discount at a nearby store.Likewise, he sees an opportunity for airlines to use their apps to manage the rebooking process when passengers miss a connection, perhaps by displaying a special phone number customers can call to get expedited help. For now, he said, booking and rebooking are tasks most passengers prefer to do on a larger screen or over the phone, although some airlines do offer booking via their apps.“We’re still in Phase One of all this,” Mr. Harteveldt said. “When it comes to mobile applications, the travel industry collectively is still in the crawl stage.”'"

"'12-03-05,'0','Mr. Thrun was enraptured by the scale of the course, and how it spawned its own culture, including a Facebook group, online discussions and an army of volunteer translators who made it available in 44 languages.“Having done this, I can’t teach at Stanford again,” he said at a digital conference in Germany in January. “I feel like there’s a red pill and a blue pill, and you can take the blue pill and go back to your classroom and lecture your 20 students. But I’ve taken the red pill, and I’ve seen Wonderland.”Besides the Artificial Intelligence course, Stanford offered two other MOOCs last semester — Machine Learning (104,000 registered, and 13,000 completed the course), and Introduction to Databases (92,000 registered, 7,000 completed). And this spring, the university will have 13 courses open to the world, including Anatomy, Cryptography, Game Theory and Natural Language Processing.“We’re considering this still completely experimental, and we’re trying to figure out the right way to go down this road,” said John Etchemendy, the Stanford provost. “Our business is education, and I’m all in favor of supporting anything that can help educate more people around the world. But there are issues to consider, from copyright questions to what it might mean for our accreditation if we provide some official credential for these courses, branded as Stanford.”Mr. Thrun sent the 23,000 students who completed the Artificial Intelligence course a PDF file (suitable for framing) by e-mail showing their percentile score, but not the Stanford name; 248 students, none from Stanford, earned grades of 100 percent.For many of the early partisans, the professed goal is more about changing the world than about making money. But Udemy, a startup with backing from the founders of Groupon, is hoping that wide use of its site could ultimately generate profits. And Mr. Thrun’s new company, Udacity, which is supported by Charles River Ventures, plans to, essentially, monetize its students’ skills — and help them get jobs — by getting their permission to sell leads to recruiters.“We’re going to have detailed records on thousands of students who have learned these skills, many of whom will want to make those skills available to employers,” said Mr. Evans, the Virginia professor. “So if a recruiter is looking for the hundred best people in some geographic area that know about machine learning, that’s something we could provide, for a fee. I think it’s the cusp of a revolution.”On Feb. 13, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, which has been posting course materials online for 10 years, opened registration for its first MOOC, a circuits and electronics course. The course will serve as the prototype for its MITx project, which will eventually offer a wide range of courses and some sort of credential for those who complete them.The Georgia Institute of Technology is running an experimental two-semester MOOC, known as Change 11, a free-floating forum that exists more in the online postings and response of the students — only two of whom are getting Georgia Tech credit — than in the formal materials assigned by a rotation of professors. Next year, Richard DeMillo, director of Georgia Tech’s Center for 21st Century Universities, hopes to put together a MOOSe, or massive open online seminar, through a network of universities that will offer credit.Udemy recently announced a new Faculty Project, in which award-winning professors from universities like Dartmouth, the University of Virginia and Northwestern offer free online courses. Its co-founder, Gagen Biyani, said the site has more than 100,000 students enrolled in its courses, including several, outside the Faculty Project, that charge fees.Experts say several factors have helped propel MOOCs to the center of the education stage, including improved technology and the exploding costs of traditional universities.“We also now have the example of for-profit colleges that have shown that it’s perfectly possible to go to scale online,” said Kevin Carey, policy director of Education Sector, an independent policy institute.Five years ago, George Siemens started a MOOC on what was happening in open education, hoping to do for teaching what M.I.T.’s OpenCourseWare had done for content: it attracted 2,300 participants, with a syllabus translated into several languages. Mr. Siemens, a professor at Athabasca University, a publicly-supported online Canadian institution, said it was quickly apparent that the format created distinctive social networks, as students carried on wide-ranging discussions on their own.“A lot of the relationships formed through that first course are still continuing today,” said Mr. Siemens, who is also a facilitator of Georgia Tech’s program. “What we found was that in a MOOC, instead of the classroom being the center, it becomes just one node of the network of social interactions.”The current, more technically focused MOOCs are highly automated, with computer-graded assignment and exams. But there is still plenty of room for social interaction. The Stanford MOOCs, for example, included virtual office hours and online discussion forums where students could ask and answer questions — and vote on which were important enough to filter up the professor.“In a classroom, when you ask a question, one student answers and the others don’t get a chance,” Mr. Thrun said. “Online, with embedded quizzes, everyone has to try to answer the questions. And if they don’t understand, they can go back and listen over and over until they do.” Just as a child who falls while learning to ride a bike is not told “You get a D,” but is encouraged to keep trying, he said, online classes, where students can work at their own pace, can help students keep practicing until they master the content.“The goal should be to get everybody to A+ level,” he said.Several students in Mr. Thrun’s class last semester, contacted by e-mail, said the MOOC worked for them.Balakrishnan Srinivasan, 45, a computer engineer in Bangalore, said he frequently replayed the videos, which made him “feel as if I had a personal tutor.” He earned a 94.8 in Artificial Intelligence and has signed up for both Udacity courses.Brian Guan, 44, a Malaysian-born software engineer who lives in Palo Alto, Calif., offered his own utopian vision in an e-mail interview: “I wish that the always-available, always-replayable and free nature of this style of learning can help to elevate education/knowledge for all of human kind.”'"

"'12-03-05,'0','The accuracy of the Apple jobs calculation in the may well be debated among economists for years. “Apple has a big effect, and big is about as precise as I can make it,” said Gary P. Pisano, a professor of business administration at Harvard Business School. “It’s hard to say the exact size.”David Autor, an economics professor at the , said via e-mail that the “entire business of claiming ‘direct and indirect’ job creation is disreputable” because most of the workers Apple is taking for would have been employed elsewhere in the company’s absence.“But of course, they might not have been as well paid or gratified with their work,” Mr. Autor said. “We’ll never know.”Mr. Autor also said that Apple should not be held accountable for employment problems in the United States. “Generating the conditions that give rise to high rates of employment and wage growth is the domain of policy makers, not individual companies,” he said.A number of companies, including , have commissioned similar research aiming to tally up such indirect employment, by suppliers and other partners. The use of “job multipliers” has become common practice, sometimes by businesses lobbying for breaks from local and state governments.But the calculations of such multipliers are often fiercely debated both in economic and political terms. For instance, the , which calculated the impact of the 2009 federal stimulus on jobs, has set estimates that vary between as few as 1.6 million jobs and as many as 8.4 million jobs.Peter Cappelli, a professor of management at the Wharton School at the , says companies often have a stronger case when quantifying their effects on a regional economy, rather than on the entire national economy. It does matter to a state, for example, whether a big business is there, though it might not matter nationally if the business moves to a different state, he said.The Analysis Group, the consulting firm Apple hired, concluded that 257,000 jobs were in companies that work directly with Apple, including employees in and New York at , a company that creates glass for the , and people at a Samsung plant in .The Analysis Group arrived at that figure by analyzing how much Apple spent on goods and services in the United States in 2011 and applying that information to a formula developed by the federal government’s Bureau of Economic Analysis called an “employment multiplier.” The group used this multiplier to calculate direct and indirect employment figures from Apple’s spending, though it omitted any jobs created through spending by those people on, say, nannies, vacation homes or restaurants.Among the outside jobs Apple said it helped support were the delivery services that bring packages of Apple devices to its retail stores and directly to customers’ homes. Norman Black, a spokesman for , said the company estimated that for every 40 new packages a day transported through its system, the company hired one more person. He declined to say how many packages Apple shipped through U.P.S. and, therefore, how many jobs could be credited to the company.“They rely on us for a lot of shipping,” Mr. Black said. “There’s no question that as they roll out and launch products, that’s creating new jobs in the U.S.”Apple’s study said the company also supported an additional 210,000 jobs among companies creating apps for Apple devices like the iPhone and . The study based that figure on the 466,000 app-related jobs that TechNet, a high-tech lobbying group, recently estimated existed in the United States. Apple’s study estimated that 45 percent of that figure could be credited to development of software for Apple devices, based on an analysis of online job listings.While several economists and employment experts agree that Apple has an economic impact that goes beyond the people it directly employs, they said it was difficult to conclude from Apple’s study what the company’s benefit is to the overall jobs market. “They certainly have a big economic impact, as does every other firm,” Mr. Cappelli said. “If you say, ‘If there had been no Apple, those people would not have jobs,’ that’s not true.”As an example, Mr. Cappelli said that if there were no iPad, the $500 an Apple customer would have spent on the device most likely would not have been put into savings, but rather spent on some other product or service. That impact could have been more or less than Apple’s. Apple is, however, an innovative company that created a market for tablets and radically increased demand for smartphones.'"
"'12-03-05,'0','Start with government employment (which is mainly at the state and local level, with about half the jobs in education). By this stage in the Reagan recovery, government employment had risen by 3.1 percent; this time around, it’s down by 2.7 percent.Next, look at government purchases of goods and services (as distinct from transfers to individuals, like unemployment benefits). Adjusted for inflation, by this stage of the Reagan recovery, such purchases had risen by 11.6 percent; this time, they’re down by 2.6 percent.And the gap persists even when you do include transfers, some of which have stayed high precisely because unemployment is still so high. Adjusted for inflation, Reagan-era spending rose 10.2 percent in the first 10 quarters of recovery, Obama-era spending only 2.6 percent.Why did government spending rise so much under Reagan, with his small-government rhetoric, while shrinking under the president so many Republicans insist is a secret socialist? In Reagan’s case, it’s partly about the arms race, but mainly about state and local governments doing what they are supposed to do: educate a growing population of children, invest in infrastructure for a growing economy.Under , however, the dire fiscal condition of state and local governments — the result of a sustained slump, which in turn was caused largely by that private debt explosion before 2008 — has led to forced spending cuts. The fiscal straits of lower-level governments could and should have been alleviated by aid from Washington, which remains able to borrow at incredibly low interest rates. But this aid was never provided on a remotely adequate scale.This policy malpractice is doing double damage to America. On one side, it’s helping lose the future — because that’s what happens when you neglect education and public . At the same time, it’s hurting us right now, by helping keep growth low and unemployment high.We’re talking big numbers here. If government employment under Mr. Obama had grown at Reagan-era rates, 1.3 million more Americans would be working as schoolteachers, firefighters, police officers, etc., than are currently employed in such jobs.And once you take the effects of public spending on private employment into account, a rough estimate is that the unemployment rate would be 1.5 percentage points lower than it is, or below 7 percent — significantly better than the Reagan economy at this stage.One implication of this comparison is that conservatives who love to compare Reagan’s record with Mr. Obama’s should think twice. Aside from the fact that recoveries from financial crises are almost always slower than ordinary recoveries, in reality Reagan was much more Keynesian than Mr. Obama, faced with an obstructionist , has ever managed to be.More important, however, there is now an easy answer to anyone asking how we can accelerate our economic recovery. By all means, let’s talk about visionary ideas; but we can take a big step toward full employment just by using the federal government’s low borrowing costs to help state and local governments rehire the schoolteachers and police officers they laid off, while restarting the road repair and improvement projects they canceled or put on hold.'"
"'12-03-05,'0','Sometime soon, probably by the end of April, the city of Detroit is likely to run out of cash. Its revenues are falling and its expenses are growing. If that happens, paychecks will not be issued, doors of public buses and city agencies could be closed, and streetlights will be shut off in more neighborhoods.Having lost so much — a quarter-million people in just a decade, its industrial base, its political clout — Detroit is now on the verge of losing control of its ability to make its own decisions. If it does not find a way to quickly stabilize its finances through spending cuts and union concessions, the state may appoint a manager to take over its budget from the mayor and the City Council.No one, least of all the state, wants that to happen. In Michigan, emergency managers can break union contracts, fire city officials and sell off city assets. That has already begun in four other cities, all of them largely black, that the state has taken over in the last few years. Black officials and union leaders have charged that Gov. Rick Snyder, a Republican elected in 2010, has an ideological and racial agenda, and taking over Detroit, which is 83 percent black, would only magnify the tension.Muscling the city aside would clearly be undemocratic, and it is not even clear how effective it would be. The state took over Detroit’s schools in 2009, and has little to show for it yet except for more closed schools and a continuing exodus of students and teachers. But an emergency manager may be inevitable.Detroit simply does not have a large enough tax base to pay for city services and billions in long-term liabilities. The turnaround in the auto industry brought about by the government bailout has been good news for Michigan and the region, and has helped lower the state’s jobless rate to 9.3 percent from 14.1 percent in 2009. Little of that, however, has trickled inside the city limits, where the unemployment rate is estimated by city officials at close to 30 percent.The city that once teemed with auto plants now has only two, a Chevrolet and a Chrysler factory. Chrysler’s gritty new slogan, “Imported From Detroit,” is a bit painful to local residents who know that the Chrysler 200, featured in an Eminem ad, is made in the suburbs, and the 300 and the Town & Country are made across the river in Ontario.Chrysler’s gleaming Jefferson North plant on the east side of town does churn out Jeep Cherokees and Dodge Durangos, and President Obama noted in a speech last week that it has been adding new shifts. But it is not enough. Just blocks from the plant is some of America’s worst urban devastation, acre upon acre of vacant land, abandoned houses, burned-out stores. A city that held nearly two million people in the 1950s is now down to 714,000, more than a third of whom live in poverty.'"

"'12-03-05,'0','Volkswagen’s Audi unit, having already moved into the subcompact segment with the A1, will take the wraps off the first redesign in almost a decade of the A3. The car, a kind of sporty small wagon, has been a huge hit in Europe, though it has made less of a mark in the United States. Volvo, now under Chinese ownership, will introduce a compact wagon called the V40.Even Porsche is moving down market, in relative terms, with plans for an S.U.V. priced below the Cayenne and a two-seat roadster that will be less expensive than the Boxster.The premium carmakers have managed to deploy their brand prestige to get buyers to pay a few thousand euros more for vehicles that, in purely practical terms, may not be dramatically better than Fords, Opels or Fiats.Consider the basic BMW Mini and the Ford Fiesta. “They are both excellent cars to drive,” Mr. Urquhart said. “The Fiesta might even be better.” Yet the least expensive Mini starts at €15,550, or $20,500, in Germany while even the top-of-the line “Titanium” version of the Fiesta lists for €700 less. So even though the Fiesta has been a top-seller for Ford of Europe — and has helped the company gain market share — it is unlikely that the car delivers the same profit margin as the Mini.“The Fiesta is a really well-designed, attractive car,” Mr. Urquhart said. “Everything about it is right. For whatever reason it doesn’t have that cachet, that X factor.”The two companies that appear to be suffering most acutely at the moment are G.M.’s Opel and Peugeot Citroën. Both sell most of their cars in Europe, which makes it more difficult for them to compensate for slack volume by exporting to more dynamic markets in Asia. Opel was largely responsible for the $747 million loss that G.M. reported for its European operations in 2011, while Peugeot Citroën’s automotive division lost €439 million last year. Both companies have been trying to move into the high end, but face tough going against Mercedes, BMW and Audi.G.M. said last week that it would take a 7 percent stake in Peugeot Citroën and cooperate to design major components. But analysts say that more radical steps will be needed to restore profitability, including plant closings.Fiat of Italy and Renault of France are also losing overall market share in Europe, while BMW and Daimler are gaining.All of the mass-market carmakers have more factory capacity than they need. Yet closing plants to cut costs is an agonizing undertaking in Europe. Political resistance is enormous because of the devastating economic effect that the demise of a car factory has on the surrounding community.The West European market is only getting worse, falling 7.9 percent in January from a year earlier, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association. Yet hard-pressed European governments are not in a position to subsidize the industry the way they did during the slump of 2009 with various kinds of scrappage schemes. This time the car companies will probably be on their own.In fact, the problems of the mass-market carmakers raise the question of whether it is possible to make money selling cars that are merely very good, as opposed to very good plus sexy, quirky or prestigious.“In the current environment it’s very hard to make money,” said Ferdinand Dudenhöffer, a professor at the University of Duisburg-Essen who follows the car industry. Mr. Dudenhöffer said that incentives offered by dealers to prospective buyers in Europe are at their highest in five years, cutting deeply into profits.Even Volkswagen, the largest carmaker in Europe, earns more from Audi than from lower-priced Volkswagen brand cars — even though Audi sells only about a third as many vehicles. At the lower end of the market, Volkswagen benefits from the Skoda brand built in Eastern Europe, where costs are lower. But Volkswagen also has its own problem with a money-bleeding subsidiary in the form of Seat, a brand made mostly in Spain that has struggled with losses for years.The company that appears to be most wowing analysts and peers is Hyundai and its affiliate Kia, which seems to have proven that it is still possible to make money in Europe with the right combination of geographical diversification, highly efficient manufacturing and attractive models.Hyundai and Kia have together surpassed Toyota in European market share with models like the Kia Cee’d, made at a spotless plant in central Slovakia. Mr. Dudenhöffer calculates that Hyundai-Kia workers are the most productive in the world.Hyundai’s i30 model even received an inadvertent endorsement from Martin Winterkorn, the chief executive of Volkswagen. In a video watched nearly 1.7 million times on YouTube, Mr. Winterkorn, surrounded by an entourage, is seen closely scrutinizing an i30 at the Frankfurt auto show last year.In the video, Mr. Winterkorn runs a finger along the Hyundai’s hood and even takes out a tape measure to gauge its dimensions. Sitting in the driver’s seat, Mr. Winterkorn tests the adjustable steering column and says with what sounds like grudging admiration, “Da scheppert nichts,” or, “It doesn’t rattle.”Opel and Peugeot continue to make innovative models. Opel will introduce a new compact S.U.V. in Geneva called the Mokka, while Peugeot will show its 208 line, some versions of which will have highly efficient three-cylinder engines.But the existing European manufacturers will have trouble replicating Hyundai’s manufacturing efficiency when they are dependent primarily on European sales and are burdened with older factories.Meanwhile, the profitable premium carmakers are taking over more and more garages in middle-class suburbs. BMW, long known for its rear-wheel drive cars, is developing front-wheel drive technology for smaller models.The Mercedes unit of Daimler is also expected to expand the smaller A- and B-Class lines, and to sell the models in the United States. The company had been reluctant to do that for fear of tarnishing its luxury image there, but has evidently concluded that American drivers are also becoming more willing to pay for compact luxury.For the traditional mass-market carmakers, there may be no choice but to become smaller and merge with rivals.“It’s not rocket science,” Mr. Urquhart of IHS Automotive said. “There has to be some consolidation. There has to be some cutting somewhere.”'"
"'12-03-05,'0','The University of Rhode Island fired its men’s basketball coach, Jim Baron, on Sunday, according to a source with direct knowledge of the situation. School officials met with the team around noon on Sunday to inform them of the decision.Baron’s firing came after a 7-24 regular season in which he threw the team’s leading scorer, Jamal Wilson, off the team. Baron coached at Rhode Island for 11 seasons, taking over a team with a gutted roster and in academic disarray, and creating a solid and consistent program. He had two years remaining on his contract.Rhode Island had won 20 games for four consecutive years before this season. The decline this year combined with Baron’s failure to reach the N.C.A.A. tournament during his entire tenure ultimately led to his firing, the source said.The decision creates a thorny decision for Baron’s son Billy, a sophomore guard who scored 13 points per game. Baron transferred to the university from Virginia this season and would face a difficult decision of whether to play for the school that fired his father or transfer again and sitting out another year.'"
"'12-03-05,'0','Neither they nor any delegate is likely to say anything publicly about jockeying over the transition.“People are not allowed to speak,” Zheng Yongnian, an expert on Chinese politics who directs the East Asian Institute at the National University of Singapore, said in an interview. Before the Communist Party congress this fall, where leadership changes are to be formally ratified, “stability must be the highest priority.”“They want to guarantee the coming transition,” Mr. Zheng said. But behind the facade, he added, “you can feel a sense of nervousness over the changes at the top.”The National People’s Congress runs nearly in tandem with a meeting of a party-appointed advisory body, the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference, which opened Saturday. While meetings of the groups’ committees and provincial delegations can be freewheeling, their formal agendas are largely free of controversy, including measures like one requiring product makers to eliminate waste in their packaging.Mr. Wen’s annual report is the most substantive event at a meeting whose agenda has long been predetermined by the leadership. In it, he said that the slowdown in China’s growth is coupled with the beginning of a structural transformation toward a consumer-based economy, a change long advocated by economic experts.The forecasts of previous annual reports have not always proven reliable. Mr. Wen set a target of 8 percent annual gross domestic product growth in his 2011 address, a figure that, as in many other reports, was easily exceeded.It also remained to be seen whether the government would be able to deliver on its pledge to shift economic growth to consumer demand. Promises to rebalance the economy have been a staple of Mr. Wen’s earlier addresses, but many structural changes crucial to that goal have been hamstrung by internal political resistance.Some experts said they had heard Mr. Wen’s refrain too often before.“There is a growing recognition that rebalancing is not really happening,” said Stephen Green, an economist at Standard Chartered Bank. “Consumption is not really going up, the state sector continues to expand, the private sector continues to suffer, the income gap is growing. This is probably not the year for rebalancing.”The government’s annual work report is reliably larded with praise for the state’s accomplishments and the superiority of socialism with Chinese characteristics, as leaders call their state-controlled economy.Mr. Wen dismissed the concerns of many economists about the ballooning debt burden of local governments and the potential for a real estate bubble, indicating that both problems were under firm state control.“Government debt in China now is at a controllable and secure level,” he said. “China’s economy as a whole continues to grow as we anticipated in our exercise of macro-controls and has become more resilient. Economic growth is robust, prices are stabilizing, economic returns are good and the people’s well-being is improving.”The two meetings bring with them an annual security lockdown on Beijing, with vast cordons of police and other security officers deployed to prevent demonstrations or attacks.'"

"'12-03-06,'0','Outside, rats prowl heaps of garbage, the homeless beg for quarters and dog droppings stucco the sidewalk. But watching “Make Mine Manhattan,” you’d never suspect that such blemishes besmirched our fair city.Dimpled and full-skirted, this sweet little revue has soft-shoed its way into the Connelly Theater and banished all ugliness to Hoboken, N.J.The show was first produced on Broadway in 1948 at the Broadhurst Theater, and has now been revived in a scaled-down version by UnsungMusicalsCo. Today’s production is what you might expect a small golden-age Broadway revue to look like: gauzy white gloves, fedoras, apple-cheeked.Almost every song is a valentine, dedicated to Manhattan or to some nameless stranger spotted across the park, and sometimes both. Every time a woman is kissed, she pops her heel or gets dipped so deeply that her spine might snap.There’s also one of those obligatory numbers in which Girl doesn’t like Boy, but after he forces her to dance with him she realizes she actually loves him. (The fox trot just might be the world’s most potent persuasion technique.)As dated as the genre and its conventions may be, some themes about New York never change.Throughout the show, survivors of humdrum Midwestern childhoods blossom after they arrive in this great unsleeping metropolis. Young lovers lament the transportational misfortune of a Bronx-Brooklyn romance. People eat disgusting things on the subway.The show is charming and peppy, even though it is often repetitive. Arnold B.

"'12-03-06,'0','WASHINGTON — Six days after hearing arguments in a major human rights case about whether corporations may be sued for complicity in torture abroad, the Supreme Court on Monday instructed the parties to address an even broader question.The court called for additional briefs to be filed by June and a reargument to be held during the court’s next term, which starts in October.The original question in the case, Kiobel v. Royal Dutch Petroleum Company, No. 10-1491, was whether corporations might be sued in United States courts for human rights violations under a 1789 law.At the argument last Tuesday, it emerged that several justices were interested in a larger question.They wanted to know whether American courts might ever hear disputes under the law for human rights abuses abroad, whether the defendant was a corporation or not.The case was brought by 12 Nigerian plaintiffs who said the defendants, foreign oil companies, had been complicit in human rights violations committed against them by the Abacha dictatorship in Nigeria.“What business does a case like that have in the courts of the United States?” Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. asked at the argument. “There’s no connection to the United States whatsoever.”'"
"'12-03-06,'0','Bay said that to some extent, there was a bit of willful ignorance among his teammates.“If we had a huge presentation on it and everybody was trying to be abreast of what was going on, it might make things way worse,” Bay said. “Honestly, I think not knowing, in this situation, for what we have to do, is huge.”The players had other things to occupy their minds anyway.Several hours before the first pitch, Jon Rauch, the team’s tallest player at 6 feet 11 inches, and Daniel Herrera, the team’s shortest at 5-6, put on each other’s uniforms and bounced gleefully through the clubhouse. The visual gag was much appreciated by their teammates.Throughout the day, several players passed the time around a pair of clubhouse televisions tuned to a game between two of their geographic rivals, the Yankees and the Philadelphia Phillies.And just over an hour before the Mets took the field, Tim Teufel, their new third-base coach, ushered a group of players into a corner of the room to test their proficiency with the team’s signs.Earlier, R. A. Dickey shot down the supposition that the financial stability of any employer could become the subject of water-cooler talk.“It’s a bit of a different dynamic in baseball,” Dickey said. “I feel like it’s a personal matter for those guys, and it doesn’t filter down to us, as far as the conversations we’re having in here.”The night’s contest provided a distraction as well. Andres Torres, leading off in his first game with the Mets, walked, stole second and scored when Daniel Murphy singled up the middle. Ike Davis, who missed most of last season and who has a lung infection, received a loud cheer before grounding into a double play.In the end, the game, which the Mets lost, 3-1, did not hold much significance. And as far as the players were concerned, neither did the judge’s decision.Zach Lutz, who was hit on the left elbow by a fastball from Bobby Parnell during an intrasquad game Sunday, did not work out Monday. Lutz, a 25-year-old third baseman who finished last season in Class AAA, had a precautionary X-ray, which turned out negative.'"
"'12-03-06,'0','But an aide to the Senate majority leader, Harry Reid, Democrat of Nevada, said Monday: “There is a decent chance that we will just take the House bill. That would be the path of least resistance. Reopening the debate would be complicated and controversial.”Mr. Reid noted possible procedural hurdles to the creation of a conference committee.“To get to conference,” Mr. Reid said, “I’ll have to have three cloture votes. And that’s always difficult. I hope we can get consent to move forward on it. At this stage, we don’t have that.”Going to conference is usually a routine action, accomplished with a single three-part motion. But supporters of the bill could face a fight over any of the three steps: disagreeing with the House, asking for a conference and authorizing the appointment of Senate conferees.The insider trading measure began as a modest bill to rehabilitate the reputation of Congress. Its focus was greatly expanded with the adoption of numerous amendments on the Senate floor.One of the most significant would, for the first time, require firms that collect “political intelligence” to register and report their activities, as lobbyists do. Such firms try to glean information from Congress and federal agencies and provide it to hedge funds, private equity funds and institutional investors, which use the data to guide investment decisions.“If someone on Wall Street is trying to make money off conversations they have with senators or staff, we should know who they are,” said Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, who proposed the registration and disclosure requirements.Critics, including the House Republican leader, Eric Cantor of Virginia, said the definition of political intelligence was exceedingly vague. Congress, they said, needs to study the industry before rushing to regulate it.Mr. Grassley said he would not give up. But he added, “I’m willing to address any concerns about the political intelligence provision being too broad and modify the language as needed.”Watchdog groups like the Project on Government Oversight and Public Citizen favor the Senate-passed measure.The co-authors of the original House bill, Representatives Louise M. Slaughter of New York and Tim Walz of Minnesota, both Democrats, called again on Monday for negotiations between the House and the Senate.They strongly support provisions of the Senate bill that would require disclosure of political intelligence activities and crack down on public corruption.The Senate bill would expand mail and wire fraud laws to prohibit “undisclosed self-dealing” in which public officials perform official acts intended to further their own financial interests.Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont and chairman of the Judiciary Committee, and Senator John Cornyn, Republican of Texas, said the proposal would undo the effects of several Supreme Court decisions that had made it more difficult to prosecute dishonest public officials. The House Judiciary Committee has approved similar legislation.But Senator Tom Coburn, Republican of Oklahoma, and some defense lawyers have expressed concern. The proposal “may blur the line between innocent behavior and criminal public corruption offenses,” Mr. Coburn said.'"
"'12-03-06,'0','When I got to the airport, I ran to the gate. There were four gates in this one little area, and I got there just as they were closing what I thought was my gate.I was so relieved when I got on board. But when I got to my seat, someone was sitting in it. The attendant just told me to take another seat.The flight was delayed for a while, but once we took off, I felt the flight was just going on for too long. I didn’t really dwell on it. I was just happy to be going home.However, I couldn’t figure out why the pilot kept talking about the weather in Syracuse. What did I care about Syracuse? I was going to New York City.We landed and I followed everyone out and I swear the hallways looked the same as Marine Terminal at La Guardia.I did think it was really odd that there was only one cab outside, and I was the only one who wanted it. I told him to take me to 89th Street and Madison Avenue and then to 94th and Park. He looked at me really strangely and then said he wanted cash for a fare that was going to cost hundreds of dollars. I got angry thinking he was just trying to take advantage of me.I went back into the terminal, composed myself, and then had the moment of clarity where I put everything together. No seat. A Syracuse weather report. A cab driver who wanted a king’s ransom. I wasn’t in New York City. I was in Syracuse.I just started laughing at myself because maybe I should have paid more attention to the skyline.I explained my situation to an agent who was very kind and flew me back to New York City at no charge. No one was really to blame but me, and considering how far he had to travel, maybe that cab driver’s fare was just fine.So much for my rush to get home. I didn’t arrive until seven hours later.'"
"'12-03-06,'0','With jet fuel at $3 a gallon, the situation would be just “ugly,” Mr. Boyd said. At $4 a gallon, it will be a full-blown crisis, he said. At the end of last week, the jet fuel price was $3.23 a gallon, about triple the average price a decade ago.But as we assess the airlines’ credible declarations for more favorable federal assistance, let me make a suggestion. If we travelers are going to have to accept higher fares, a reduced air travel network and less federal regulation as the price of commercial aviation viability, why don’t we, as travel consumers, nail up our own manifesto to the airline industry’s door?Let me start with just two items of my own to begin this On the Road Column Airline Consumer Manifesto. Readers may wish to add their own suggestion for a follow-up.¶ Airlines must be more clear about their relationships with the regional airlines — the companies they contract with to provide regional jet and some turbojet service for small and midsize airports, where some of the worst disruptions now occur. Far too often, passengers who have problems on connecting regional flights are frustrated in trying to deal with the major airline, which sold them the ticket but sometimes shrugs off its responsibilities to the contractor that flies the plane.For major airlines except Southwest, regional airlines form the backbone of service between the big airline hubs and many midsize and small airports. Regional airline flights, for instance, account for about two-thirds of the departures at Chicago O’Hare and Washington-Dulles airports. But that business is struggling as major airlines re-evaluate domestic route networks to get the most revenue possible for every mile flown.“Regional airlines are not airlines,” Mr. Boyd said. “They’re leasing companies, and the kind of equipment they lease, especially 50-seat regional jets, is becoming less and less economically feasible.” He added that “the need for what they provide is going away” as major airlines drop service on those the smaller jets.¶ Customer service complaints must be handled better. For one thing, I hear far too often from travelers who are angry about being threatened with arrest, as I noted in last week’s column, by airline employees who are merely annoyed by the customer’s insistence on getting better information. So I propose that any airline employee who threatens a customer with arrest for any reason be required to file a formal report of the incident for independent evaluation.As I said, just a few thoughts. Yours are welcome.Incidentally, I think we can get Ralph Nader, the founder of the consumer advocacy group Public Citizen, to join our movement, given his growing vexation with air travel.“I’m trying to get the Harvard Business School to do a case study” on how companies can continue alienating customers with bad service and get away with it, he told me recently.“I never saw anything remotely like this when I started fighting against the airlines back in the 1960s,” he said. “Those issues were totally trivial compared with what we’re dealing with today. You can expose them and they just don’t care.”'"
"'12-03-06,'0','The manufacturer of the popular hair-straightening product Brazilian Blowout, the subject of government inquiries and health complaints, said on Monday that it had agreed to settle a class-action lawsuit for about $4.5 million.Under the terms of the agreement, consumers who contend they were harmed by the product would receive a $35 payment for each treatment, up to three total, and stylists would receive $75 for each bottle of the product they bought, said Elizabeth Pritzker, a lawyer for the plaintiffs.In addition, Brazilian Blowout can no longer market its product as “formaldehyde free,” and the company must provide more detailed instructions on how to use it safely, she said.“They can still sell the product as long as they market it appropriately,” Ms. Pritzker said. “Our major concern is that people simply know what it is that they are buying.”The proposed settlement goes before Judge Elihu Berle of Los Angeles Superior Court on Tuesday for approval.'"
"'12-03-06,'0','The Food and Drug Administration on Monday rejected an application by Merck to combine a cholesterol-fighting pill with the generic version of Lipitor.Merck had hoped the combination drug would offer an alternative to its troubled cholesterol drug Vytorin.In announcing the F.D.A decision, Merck said the agency had asked for additional data that could lead it to reconsider the drug combination.The proposed new drug would combine Merck’s drug Zetia, which lowers low-density lipoprotein (L.D.L., or “bad” cholesterol) with the generic version of Lipitor, the best-selling statin made by its rival, Pfizer, that lost its patent protection last year.The news is a setback for Merck, which has had trouble with Vytorin, which combines Zetia with a different statin. Zetia, known chemically as ezetimibe, has been shown to lower bad cholesterol, but it is still not known whether it reduces heart disease. It is not known whether Vytorin, which was approved in 2004, is more effective than a statin alone.'"
"'12-03-06,'0','Immediately, the necks bent backward by 90 degrees. After three months and significant rotting, they had twisted further backward — to 140 degrees.These results were verified at Brigham Young University by a paleontologist, Brooks B. Britt, and an undergraduate student, Alicia Cutler.“When you hold a carcass in your hand, it’s like a limp rag, you can move it anywhere,” Dr. Britt said. “But as soon as we put the first dead chicken in the water, we realized, ‘Holy smokes, this is amazing.’ The head immediately curved backwards.”To test whether muscle contractions caused the spasms, both groups of researchers removed the skin and muscle from the birds, and got the same result. Only by cutting the ligaments between vertebrae could they prevent the necks from bending backward in water.The teams independently concluded that the ligaments in chicken necks were like rubber bands — bendable, but contracted by default to hold the bird’s head upright against gravity. In the dead chicken, those ligaments still want to return to their natural, unstretched position, but the dead weight of the bird fights against it. In water, however, buoyancy and lack of friction allow the ligaments to contract into their natural shape, cranking the neck backward as they go.The observations have been replicated in other bird species, in saltwater and fresh water, and at various depths. Because birds are living dinosaurs, the researchers think the same phenomenon may have caused opisthotonic posture in nonavian dinosaurs as well.Kevin Padian, a paleontologist at the University of California, Berkeley, is not entirely convinced. Because similar contortions of the spine and neck occur when modern animals experience trauma, he has argued that a fossil’s opisthotonic posture could indicate that the animal died of suffocation, starvation, poisoning or other brain injuries.Mr. Reisdorf “may be onto something, but it remains to be seen,” Dr. Padian said. The new observations don’t explain the opisthotonic fossils found in dry, non-aqueous sediments. Nor do they explain how mammals — which have a different ligament anatomy — also fossilized with these postures.“I don’t think the two theories are mutually exclusive,” he continued. “The question is, how do you tell what’s really going on?” Like a 150-million-year-old crime scene, ancient fossils offer few clues to help paleontologists reconstruct the past.But Mr. Reisdorf and Dr. Britt say their research reprieves most of these dinosaurs from the agonizing deaths that had been proposed for them. “A longstanding debate has been solved,” Dr. Britt said, “and it turns out to be pretty doggone simple: Just add water.”'"

"'12-03-06,'0','The use of statin drugs to lower cholesterol in people with stable coronary artery disease is associated with a significantly reduced risk for depression, a new study reports.It has been well established in many studies that coronary artery disease increases the risk for symptoms of major depression — feelings of hopelessness and despair so severe that they interfere with daily routines and activities.Researchers recruited 965 people with stable coronary artery disease at outpatient clinics in the San Francisco Bay Area, tracking their statin use and depressive symptoms over six years. The study was published online Feb. 21 in The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry.Statin users had fewer symptoms of depression at the start of the study. And among the 776 people free of depression at the beginning, those who took statins were significantly less likely than those who did not to develop depression over the course of the study. Even after adjusting for age, sex, smoking, education, income, social support, baseline depression symptoms, medication use and other factors, statin use was associated with a decrease of 38 percent in the odds of developing depressive symptoms during the follow-up period.“We’re not sure that this association is causal,” said Dr. Mary A. Whooley, the senior author and a professor of medicine at the San Francisco Veterans Affairs Medical Center. “This is an observational study and not a randomized trial.” Still, she said, “the findings are very intriguing.”'"
"'12-03-06,'0','LONDON — Greece moved closer Monday to avoiding default when a large group of private sector bondholders said that it would participate in a restructuring through a bond swap.The Institute of International Finance, a global banking group that represents large private sector holders of Greek debt, said that 12 members of its steering committee would trade in their Greek bonds for new ones, at a loss of as much as 75 percent.The committee includes some of the largest individual holders of the estimated 177 billion euros, or $234 billion, of bonds in question, including Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank of Germany and BNP Paribas of France.The announcement was not a surprise because the committee had negotiated the debt-swap deal. But the agreement of these large banks, with institutions in Greece that have already joined the deal, means that Athens is likely to surpass its target of acceptance by holders of 75 percent of the debt outstanding.A restructuring to make Greece’s huge debt burden sustainable is a condition for the release of 130 billion euros in bailout cash that Greece has been promised by international lenders. Without the debt swap, Greece would probably default this month.'"
"'12-03-06,'0','LONDON — Iceland opened a criminal trial on Monday against its former prime minister, Geir H. Haarde, becoming the first country to prosecute one of its leaders over the financial crisis of 2008.Mr. Haarde is charged, in effect, with doing too little to protect the country against the depredations of its bankers as they pursued wildly expansionary lending that resulted in financial disaster for the country. He was indicted in 2010 by a sharply divided Parliament, charged with violating the laws of ministerial responsibility.Public opinion in Iceland about the case is split, according to Hannes Holmsteinn Gissurarson, a professor at the University of Iceland. Some people hope the case will help to shine more light on a traumatic episode, but “many think that Haarde is a sacrificial lamb, and that it is strange to drag him in front of court for something he failed to do,” Mr. Gissurarson said. “He may be a failed politician, but is he a criminal?”The trial opened a month after a prosecutor indicted the former heads of Kaupthing, one of three failed Icelandic banks, on charges of fraud and market manipulation. Hreidar Mar Sigurdsson, Kaupthing’s former chief executive, and Sigurdur Einarsson, the former chairman, have pleaded not guilty and are due in court later this year.Iceland was hit harder by the global financial crisis than many other countries because of its inflated banking system. In a matter of weeks after the banks’ collapse, the unemployment rate jumped to 10 percent, house prices fell, the currency plunged and inflation surged.'"
"'12-03-06,'0','The Mets, having lost $120 million the last two years, made the biggest one-season payroll reduction in baseball history last fall. They signed no big-money players for the second straight off-season, saw their revenue at Citi Field shrink further in 2011, and have key players coming back from injuries or nursing new ones.The lawsuit, filed in late 2010 by Irving H. Picard, the court-appointed trustee, originally sought $1 billion from Wilpon, Katz and their dozens of co-defendants, who include relatives like Wilpon’s son, Jeff; executives who work for Sterling Equities, the holding company that owns the Mets; and the team itself.The Mets, soon after the lawsuit became public, quickly put a portion of the team up for sale. More than a year after that announcement, the team is still trying to raise the $200 million it is seeking for a 40 percent chunk of the team.Meanwhile, the team’s debts have only expanded, with a $25 million loan from Major League Baseball in late 2010 and a $40 million bridge loan last fall from Bank of America needed to keep the club operating while it sought investors.Wilpon and Katz’s greatest hope for relief was that Rakoff, who had earlier reduced the size of the lawsuit, would declare there was not enough evidence against the men to go to trial. Instead, they now face a possible jury verdict of more than $300 million.For Picard, the decision was a welcome development after a series of significant disappointments. Rakoff, against the wishes of Picard, had seized the case from bankruptcy court, asserting that the lawsuit raised complex questions of securities law best heard in federal district court. He then dismissed 8 of the 11 claims against the Mets’ owners last September, and perhaps most significant for the trustee’s efforts to recoup money from scores of other Madoff investors, Rakoff sharply limited the time frame that the trustee could use to recover money from Wilpon and Katz.In Monday’s ruling, Rakoff said he remained skeptical that Picard could prevail at trial on the question of whether the men’s conduct met the legal standard of willful blindness, a threshold that must be established for the jury to award the $303 million that will be at stake in the trial.Last August, during a hearing, Rakoff said that in essence, the legal term willful blindness means that one “purposely turned away from learning something because you knew there was a high probability that you would learn something bad that would render improper what you were doing.”Wilpon and Katz have argued that they never saw anything that looked like fraud during their investing with Madoff, and that the trustee has distorted and fabricated the evidence against them.In a statement Monday, Sterling Equities said its partners were preparing for trial and “look forward to demonstrating that we were not willfully blind to the Madoff fraud.”Rakoff’s ruling Monday also meant that one key aspect of the lawsuit will not go to trial — the claim by the trustee that Wilpon and Katz were “net winners” during their years of investing with Madoff, and that they now must return millions of dollars of what the trustee calls “fictitious profits.”The trustee has sought $83 million, but Rakoff indicated he would hear additional arguments about whether that is indeed what Wilpon and Katz owe.The Mets’ owners, given the heavily leveraged state of their multiple businesses, would seem poorly positioned to produce a substantial amount of cash quickly. They could choose to formally appeal Rakoff’s ruling, but even then they would have to post a bond worth 110 percent of what they might owe. If Rakoff rules the figure is $83 million, they must post $91 million.What seems certain is that almost all aspects of the case — those decided to date and those to be decided — will be appealed by one side or the other. The stakes for both are that high. The trustee already has asked a federal appeals court to review Rakoff’s decision to limit how many years it can look back to recover fictitious profits and principal from Wilpon and Katz and many other investors that the trustee has asserted profited improperly from their dealings with Madoff. And lawyers for the Mets have asked the Supreme Court to review a ruling that denied their and others investors’ claims of losses at Madoff’s hands.Looming ahead, though, is a trial unlike any that baseball has seen. It could end with jurors backing Wilpon and Katz, or rendering a verdict that could affect their entire business empire.'"

It is not necessarily the end of the world, but it gave people a reason to take some money off the table,” he said.Shares of materials, which are sensitive to signs of slowing in China’s commodity-hungry economy, dropped and were the biggest drag on Wall Street. The S.& P. materials sector index fell 1.6 percent, with Freeport McMoRan Copper and Gold off 3.8 percent at $40.45.The S.& P. 500-stock index dipped 5.30 points, or 0.39 percent, to 1,364.33. The Dow Jones industrial average shed 14.76 points, or 0.11 percent, to 12,962.81. The Nasdaq composite index lost 25.71 points, or 0.86 percent, to close at 2,950.48.The Institute for Supply Management said its services index rose to 57.3 in February from 56.8 in January. Economists expected a drop to 56.1.It was the index’s highest level since February 2011. The services sector accounts for about two-thirds of economic activity in the United States. A reading above 50 indicates expansion.In another report, the Commerce Department said orders for manufactured goods fell 1 percent, not as big as the 1.5 percent drop that economists were expecting. Still, it was the biggest decline since October 2010.The Nasdaq registered the biggest decline among the three major stock indexes as Apple dropped as much as 3.5 percent to a session low at $526 share on heavy volume. By the close, Apple had recouped some of that loss, closing down 2.2 percent at $533.16. “There is talk about iPad sales slowing down and all that,” Mr. Polcari said. Sales, he added, have gone straight up with no correction, “so any whiff of the slightest miss or negative news is going to take money right out of it, and that’s what you saw today,” he said.In another deal weighing on investor sentiment Monday, Greece warned it was ready to enforce losses on its private sector creditors, although major Greek bondholders later voiced their support for the deal.Steel makers in the United States were also hurt by the news from China. AK Steel fell 6.1 percent, to $7.29; United States Steel dropped 4.7 percent, to $26.21; and Nucor slipped 2.4 percent, to $42.52.Interest rates were higher on Monday. The Treasury’s benchmark 10-year note fell 8/32, to 99 30/32, and the yield rose to 2.01 percent from 1.96 percent late Friday.'"
"'12-03-06,'0','BEIJING — Three Tibetans killed themselves by self-immolation in two different Tibetan regions of western China over the past three days, to protest China’s repression of Tibet, according to reports by Tibetan exile groups and Radio Free Asia, which is financed by the United States government.The three deaths — a man and two women — bring the number of Tibetans who have set fire to themselves in western China since March 2011 to at least 25; at least 17 have died.Free Tibet, an advocacy group, said that an 18-year-old identified as Dorjee set fire to himself on Monday in the Sichuan provincial town of Chara, about 40 miles from the town of Aba, known in Tibetan as Ngaba, where many of the self-immolations have taken place. The group quoted a witness as saying Dorjee walked “in flames to a government office building where he collapsed.”The Radio Free Asia report said that Rinchen, a 32-year-old widow and mother of three, killed herself by self-immolation on Sunday in front of the Kirti Monastery in in Ngaba. A report by Free Tibet, said Rinchen had four children.On Saturday, a woman who attends a middle school in Maqu County in Gansu Province set fire to herself in a vegetable market, Radio Free Asia reported. On Monday, the Tibetan Women’s Association, an exile advocacy group, identified the woman who killed herself as Tsering Kyi, age 19; Free Tibet said she was 20.“This third self-immolation in as many days underlines that Tibetans will not stop protesting until their calls for freedom are heeded,” said Stephanie Brigden, director of Free Tibet.The women’s association said the self-immolations by the women were the first by Tibetan laywomen in Tibet’s history. Previously, only nuns or former nuns had set fire to themselves.'"
"'12-03-06,'0','Scientists have discovered the world’s oldest fleas to date — bloodsuckers that lived among (and possibly on) dinosaurs.Fossils found in northeastern China belong to two ancient species of fleas, the researchers report in the current issue of the journal Nature: one dating to the Middle Jurassic, about 165 million years ago, and the other to the Early Cretaceous, about 125 million years ago.Females ranged from one-eighth to half an inch long, males from one-sixth to a third of an inch.That makes them giants. Today’s fleas are only about one-tenth the size.Also, although modern fleas feed primarily on the blood of mammals, the ancient fleas may have relied on that of dinosaurs.“They had very elongated and sharp mouth parts,” said the study’s first author, Diying Huang, a paleontologist at the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Nanjing.'"

"'12-03-07,'1','Fifteen Somali men accused of being pirates, who were captured aboard a hijacked Iranian fishing vessel by the United States Navy in January, were transferred on Tuesday to the Seychelles for trial.The move from Djibouti to the Seychelles, an island nation in the Indian Ocean, was a welcome development for the United States in a high-profile case that had no clear legal resolution.It also signaled the end of an intensive interagency effort to find a jurisdiction willing to receive the suspects, who had been held aboard a series of American warships for almost two months.From its outset, the case, for all its high-seas drama, underscored the difficulties in developing effective and comprehensive programs to fight piracy. Capturing pirates, once international navies applied themselves to the task, has proved easier than bringing them to justice.None of the nations most directly involved in the case — Somalia, home of the suspects; Iran, home of 13 hostages seized in the case; or the United States, which detained the Somalis — had either the capacity or desire to take on the costs and difficulties of prosecuting the suspects.'"
"'12-03-07,'1','Suffolk County’s more affluent next-door neighbor, Nassau County, has had a control board since 2000, whose dealings with the county have been rocky. The board seized control of Nassau’s finances in January 2011, saying the county had failed to balance its $2.7 billion budget. The Nassau County executive, Edward P. Mangano, sued, accusing the board of overreaching and treating the county unfairly because he is a Republican. A court dismissed most of Mr. Mangano’s complaints.Mr. Bellone said he had been shocked to learn that Suffolk County faced a deficit this year, because just two months ago it had reported a balanced budget. The new independent report said the deficit would grow sharply next year unless the county took action.Mr. Bellone said he would leave it to others to determine whether anyone had falsified county records to hide the deficit now coming into view. The county’s audited financial statement for 2011 is expected in a few weeks.In the meantime, he said, the county laid off 12 lawyers so it could hire financial officials who will look for ways of delivering county services more efficiently.Mr. Bellone, who was elected last November, said he sought an outside financial review in January because he wanted to know how bad the county’s problems were. The seven-member task force found that Suffolk County’s expenses had been rising every year, in particular because residents required more public services during recessions.At the same time, revenues have not kept up. Suffolk County gets 45 percent of its revenue from sales taxes, and those dived in 2008 and have not yet climbed all the way back. An additional 22 percent of the county’s revenue comes from real estate taxes, which were hurt after the housing bubble burst.To close the gap, the county has been drawing down reserves for the last few years. Now its “rainy day” money is almost gone, and it cannot increase property taxes to solve its problems because New York State has capped property tax increases.The county has resorted to issuing various types of short-term debt to finance day-to-day operations. That is a tool that New York City used in 1974 in its unsuccessful attempts to stave off the fiscal crisis of 1975.“I don’t necessarily say that this is like New York City, but I think it’s clear that the county is facing financial challenges,” said Geordie Thompson, a vice president and senior credit analyst at Moody’s Investors Service.Moody’s took the unusual step of downgrading Suffolk County’s short-term debt in December, and it has put the county’s general-obligation bonds on review for a possible downgrade.“Everybody always thought Suffolk County was doing O.K.,” Mr. Bellone said. “It turns out that was not accurate at all. In fact, Suffolk County has got a real crisis on its hands.”'"
"'12-03-07,'1','New York’s leading gay rights organization has dismissed its executive director, who played a central role in the legalization of same-sex marriage last year.The organization, the Empire State Pride Agenda, posted a statement on its Web site on Tuesday saying that its executive director, Ross D. Levi, was no longer serving in that position, and that his deputy, Lynn Faria, was taking over immediately as interim executive director.People involved in the discussions said that despite the passage of the marriage measure under Mr. Levi’s watch, board members felt that his low-key, unassuming style was ill-suited to the job of executive director and that he had failed to articulate a compelling vision for the future of the organization.Mr. Levi was fired on Monday after a pair of conference calls that day among board members of the organization and its sibling nonprofit group, the Empire State Pride Agenda Foundation, one board member said. The board member, who would discuss internal matters only on the condition of anonymity, said that Mr. Levi had been offered a severance package if he would resign and sign a confidentiality agreement, but that Mr. Levi had declined.In an interview, a chairwoman of the foundation, Marla Hassner, would not comment on the circumstances of Mr. Levi’s departure, saying that the group did not discuss such matters.Mr. Levi, in a statement, said, “I am extremely proud of my 12-year tenure with the Pride Agenda, and the work I did as executive director.” Noting some of the organization’s accomplishments in recent years, he said, “I am hopeful about its future successes.”'"
"'12-03-07,'1','“One, he’s really good at it,” said Coach Mike D’Antoni, who has been a fan of Chandler’s for many years. “Two, he concentrates on all the little things — walk-throughs, film session — and he’s not afraid to speak up, and he’s not afraid to say, ‘That’s not good enough’ to players.“Coaches can only go so far,” D’Antoni continued, “and then there’s peer pressure. And that’s probably the best. And he doesn’t say it in a spiteful or ‘I know everything’ way. He just says it in the right way. And guys buy into it, they rally around him and he’s the focal point of our defense this year.”Chandler, 29, is averaging 11.6 points, 9.8 rebounds, 1.43 blocks and shooting a league-best 68.9 percent from the field.“I think he’s as good as any center in the league,” D’Antoni said. “What he brings to the table —whether somebody gives you more here or somebody gives you more there — his overall play and his intangibles in the locker room, there’s nobody better in the game.”Chandler’s contributions extend beyond the box score. On a roster loaded with All-Stars, former All-Stars and budding stars, only Chandler has won a championship, which carries its own cachet and credibility. He has been the Knicks’ most vocal leader this season.“I know what it takes to win a championship now at this point,” Chandler said. “I’m not going back to the early days in my career, where I just sit around and watch and don’t voice my opinion. I’m going to push my teammates and myself. And hopefully, at the end of the day, that makes us a contender.”D’Antoni said Chandler’s voice “carries a lot of weight, more with some people than others.”“But he would never throw it in your face,” D’Antoni said. “He’s not that type.”WHERE IT ALL BEGAN This trip was also a homecoming of sorts for Jeremy Lin, whose N.B.A. odyssey began as a member of the Mavericks’ summer-league team in 2010. He spent a week practicing with the team at American Airlines Center before heading to Las Vegas, where he impressed scouts and ultimately earned a contract from the Golden State Warriors.Lin had gone undrafted that June. His only summer-league offer came from the Mavericks’ general manager, Donnie Nelson.“It was good to be back and it was good to just be here,” Lin said. “Donnie Nelson was the one who first gave me an opportunity, and I’ll forever be thankful to him for that.”Lin recalled a conversation with Nelson after the Portsmouth Invitational, an event for fringe draft prospects: “He said, ‘I like your game.’ He said, ‘I think you’re one year away from being able to play in the N.B.A., and I’d like you to play for the Texas Legends,’ ” the Mavericks’ affiliate in the Development League.In summer-league practices, Lin competed against Roddy Beaubois and Dominique Jones, and had the chance to reacquaint himself with the point-guard position after primarily playing shooting guard at Harvard.Those practices “really helped me just get my feel back for being a point guard,” Lin said.“So that was helpful,” he added. “And then at the same time, I saw what I really need to work on by playing against Roddy and Dominique Jones. So that was an eye-opening experience for me. And I saw what could work for me and what wouldn’t work for me, and then I had to make another adjustment once it went from summer league to the N.B.A.”Asked if he would be starting for the Knicks if not for his brief time with the Mavericks, Lin said, “Probably not.”“All I know is, he gave me a chance,” Lin said of Nelson, “and that definitely has something to do with me being able to even be in the N.B.A. this year.”'"
"'12-03-07,'1','In the 1990s, when the anti-sweatshop movement was going strong, Paul Krugman, before he became a columnist for The New York Times, wrote that “as long as you have no realistic alternative to industrialization based on low wages, to oppose it means that you are willing to deny desperately poor people the best chance they have of progress for the sake of what amounts to an aesthetic standard — that is, the fact that you don’t like the idea of workers being paid a pittance to supply rich Westerners with fashion items.”Today, globalization has a decidedly better track record than its alternative. Countries that receive lots of multinational investment have grown faster. They report less poverty and less use of child labor.China is an example of globalization’s benefits. Foreign investment has surged over the last 20 years, driving spectacular economic growth. Wages in the nonfarm sector have risen 10 percent a year in real terms over the last decade, according to Nicholas Lardy of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.The nation’s poverty rate, measured by the share of the population living on less than $1.25 a day, fell to 17 percent by the middle of the last decade, from 64 percent in the early 1990s, according to World Bank statistics. In Bangladesh, ignored by foreign capital, half of the population live in abject poverty, roughly the same share as in 1981. As Joan Robinson, a British economist, noted half a century ago, “the misery of being exploited by capitalists is nothing compared to the misery of not being exploited at all.”This poses a quandary for would-be activists in the West. They see their task as convincing multinationals like Apple that whatever the cost of improved working conditions at its suppliers’ plants, it is less than the potential cost to its reputation of allowing workers to toil in sweatshop conditions. But they must not forget that the No. 1 priority for most of Foxconn’s workers is to keep their job. While outside pressure might improve their lives, it could also persuade Foxconn to replace them.The anti-sweatshop movement’s origins can be traced to late 1980s Indonesia, a global hub of the apparel and footwear business. Reports of violations of workers’ rights at Indonesian suppliers to big brands like Nike and Reebok led unions and human rights groups to press the United States to suspend Indonesian trade preferences. Articles about women stitching Nikes in dismal conditions for 91 cents a day appeared in the press, mobilizing campaigns against the apparel giant.For a while it seemed that activism could win the day: the Indonesian minimum wage rose from less than 80 cents to about $1.80 a day from 1990 to 1996. Wages at factories for brand-name sneakers rose even faster, as the brands forced suppliers to comply with the wage floor. Nike issued a code of conduct requiring suppliers to adhere to labor, health and environmental standards. Many other victories followed, with big brands repeatedly acceding to demands that they enforce better working conditions at their suppliers’ plants across the third world.But in time, many of the victories of consumer activism turned a little sour. Though Indonesian factories that stitched sneakers for big brands like Nike did add jobs in the 1990s, despite the sharply higher wages, economists reported significant job losses throughout the economy. Activists bemoan the fact that even when they persuade brands to press their suppliers to improve working conditions, victories turn to defeat when suppliers try to pass on the additional cost of higher wages, shorter hours or increased benefits.“When brands get caught at one facility, and pressure is brought to bear, they can be forced to push for changes at that facility,” said Scott Nova, executive director of the Workers Rights Consortium, which monitors working conditions at plants that make college-brand clothes. “However, if those changes raise costs and slow delivery times, it is easy enough, a year or two down the road, for the brand to reduce orders at that factory in favor of others.”The most telling commentary on the effectiveness of the anti-sweatshop movement is the prevalence, years later, of dismal working conditions and illegally low wages at many suppliers of the world’s large multinational brandsApple’s critics should not despair, however. Despite failures and drawbacks, activists have made progress.For one thing, they have persuaded major brands and retailers to take responsibility for working conditions along their supplier pipeline — something unheard-of two decades ago. And the anti-sweatshop movement has contributed to improvements in workers’ lives in concrete ways, forcing better compliance with health and safety norms and reducing the most egregious forms of harassment.But the most promising consideration for critics is just how different Apple is from the companies singled out by the anti-sweatshop movement of the 1990s.For starters, Apple’s enormous profit margins — owing to the great popularity of the inimitable products it sells — vastly outstrip the thin margins prevalent in the garment and footwear industry and make it much easier for the company to absorb the cost of improving worker conditions at its suppliers.What’s more, supplier contracts in the electronic industry tend to be much longer than the three-month terms common in the apparel business. This gives Apple a much bigger stake in the long-term success of Foxconn as a supplier, and makes it less attractive to cut and run to a cheaper option.And Apple’s vaunted ability to make suppliers twirl on a dime to satisfy its most exacting specifications in the shortest possible time suggests the company would have little trouble imposing rules on wages or workers’ rights.Consumer pressure and bad publicity have already led Apple to make some big changes. In 2005 it created a code of conduct for its suppliers, monitored regularly. Last month it became the first electronics company to join the Fair Labor Association, a group set up in 1999 by companies, universities and nonprofit groups to monitor working conditions at garment makers in the third world. Over the last two years, Foxconn has announced repeated wage increases at its plant in Shenzhen.These are early days. Who knows, if activists keep up the pressure, they might help lead to significant improvements in the lives of Foxconn’s workers and make us feel better about how our iPhones are made.'"
"'12-03-07,'1','His experience is not at all uncommon. Before the game, the faces of many Mets players lit up as they recalled the first time they were called to spend a day in big-league camp.“You would have thought it was Game 7 of the World Series with how nervous I was,” said David Wright, who was drafted by the Mets as a teenager in 2001.Ike Davis said he remembered popping up in his first at-bat and playing just a couple of innings in the field his first time in 2009. But the experience, he said, was not about performance.“You get to be in the same clubhouse as major leaguers,” Davis said. “You sit on the bench with them, see what they do, see how they work.”And, Davis said, “You get better food.”This was not lost on Nimmo, who spent the morning doing his routine at the minor league side of the Mets complex before being led over to the major league clubhouse before lunch.He seemed particularly impressed by one item in the major league spread, a dish of baked bell peppers stuffed with beef and rice.“I never saw those in the minor league side,” Nimmo said, laughing. “There was more variety. I definitely enjoyed that.”Sandy Alderson, the general manager of the Mets, acknowledged observing young players in such situations, but he played down the importance.“Ultimately, it would be unfair to draw any conclusions during what for the most part is just supposed to be a fun and exciting opportunity for them,” Alderson said.Demonstrating the point, Alderson left his seat in the stands before Nimmo entered the game as a pinch-hitter in the bottom of the seventh.Wearing No. 87, Nimmo walked to the plate with some cheers of recognition from the crowd. He walked after a seven-pitch sequence and then scored from second base on a fielding error.“Scoring was great,” said Nimmo, who grounded out to third the next inning. “You hear the crowd as you’re running down third base; the volume’s coming up.”Scott Hairston said he remembered feeling somewhat like an outcast because he was not aware of every major league clubhouse convention. Nimmo would experience a bit of that, too.Late in the game, Nimmo was playfully chided by Jack Voigt, the minor league outfield coordinator, after running onto the field to slap D. J. Carrasco on the back as the pitcher strolled toward to the dugout. The unwritten rule, he said, is that you let the pitcher reach the dugout before congratulating him.“Jack yelled, ‘What are you doing?’ ” Nimmo said, laughing. “I looked back, and I was the only one out there.”Manager Terry Collins said afterward that he hoped the minor leaguers valued such experiences, and thought about what it would take for them to get back to the major league clubhouse.The message would not have been lost on Nimmo. As he stood along the rail in the ninth inning, no one around him, he turned his eyes upward and pointed a finger to the sky. The gesture was brief and subtle, but filled with meaning.“It was just me giving thanks to God,” Nimmo said, “because this is amazing, that this is my job.”'"
"'12-03-07,'1','Newt Gingrich prevailed in his native state, Georgia, doing best with older and less educated voters and those who live in small towns and rural areas. Men and women backed Mr. Gingrich about equally. “I’m a Georgia girl, and I just love Newt,” said Patches Mongeon, 38, a wholesale accounts manager voting in Atlanta.In Ohio, unemployment is at 7.7 percent, lower than the national rate of 8.3 percent. Still, more than half of voters in Ohio considered the economy the most important issue; about a quarter pointed to the federal budget deficit. About three-quarters said they were very worried about the direction of the nation’s economy.Among voters in Georgia, where the unemployment rate is above the national average and the foreclosure rate is one of the highest in the country, nearly 6 in 10 selected the economy as the top issue. It also mattered most for nearly 6 in 10 voters in Massachusetts, which has one of the highest median incomes and low unemployment. In Oklahoma, Vermont and Virginia, voters for whom the economy was the top issue also backed Mr. Romney.More than 7 in 10 voters said the price of gas was an important factor in their vote. Less affluent voters were more likely to say that gas prices affected their vote choice, particularly in Georgia.Although Mr. Romney had trouble in Georgia and Tennessee with very conservative voters, he did win a majority of the primarygoers in Georgia with an advanced degree and of the voters whose family income was over $200,000. Both of these groups also favored Mr. Romney in Tennessee, as did, moderates, Tea Party opponents, those favoring abortion rights and those looking for a candidate who can beat Obama.In the earlier contests, Ron Paul did very well with younger voters — getting a sizable portion of those under 30 in some states, where he received a smaller percentage of the overall vote than other candidates.Tuesday was no exception. About 3 in 10 under 30 in Ohio and Tennessee voted for Mr. Paul. In Virginia, where he and Mr. Romney were the only candidates on the ballot, Mr. Paul received more than 60 percent of the votes of those under 30 (in fact about 60 percent of those under 45). The “younger” vote, however, does not have much of an impact in the Republican primaries — about 10 percent or less in the contests on Tuesday were under 30.“He’s the only candidate talking about limiting the size of government, reducing the debt and maintaining personal liberties,” said Matt Martin, 29, a youth minister in Smyrna, Ga., who voted with his toddler and infant in tow. “All the other choices are votes for more government and more big government.”Although Mr. Romney was regarded as the conservative alternative to John McCain when he ran for the nomination four years ago, many voters on Tuesday saw Mr. Romney as not conservative enough. At the same time, Mr. Santorum and Mr. Paul were seen as too conservative. Mr. Gingrich was the only candidate whose positions were selected as “about right” by most primary voters.Fred Russo, 70, and his wife, Estelle, 65, also came to the polls to vote for Mr. Romney at St. Mary Magdalene Catholic Church in Willowick, Ohio, a small suburb about 20 miles east of Cleveland. “I would prefer someone more conservative, but it’s important to beat Obama,” he said.In earlier primaries, with the exception of South Carolina, Mr. Romney did best with voters who were looking for a candidate who can defeat President Obama. On Tuesday, 4 in 10 of those voters backed Mr. Romney in Tennessee, while a third voted for Mr. Gingrich. Almost half of these voters backed Mr. Gingrich in Georgia, but almost as many supported Mr. Romney in Oklahoma.In the rest of the states on Tuesday, Mr. Romney received a majority. The exit polls were conducted by Edison Research for a consortium of the television networks and The Associated Press and included in-person interviews with voters as they were leaving polling places across the state and telephone interviews with early and absentee voters.'"
"'12-03-07,'1','The prices of drugs used most widely by older Americans rose by nearly 26 percent from 2005 to 2009 — nearly twice the rate of inflation — according to a report issued Tuesday by AARP.The increase happened even as the price of generic drugs, which account for the vast majority of prescriptions, has been falling in recent years, the report found. “At a time when our country is contracting economically and inflation is really, really low, inflation in the cost of prescription drugs is going in the other direction,” said Cheryl Matheis, the senior vice president for policy strategy at AARP, whose members are 50 and older. “The word we use is relentless because it just doesn’t seem to abate.”But officials in the pharmaceutical industry criticized the report, saying that the expanded availability of generic drugs has slowed the increase in drug prices in recent years. “AARP has released yet another misleading pricing report that ignores key facts about the marketplace for prescription medicines and paints an inaccurate picture of prescription drug spending in the U.S.,” the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, the industry trade and lobbying group, said in a statement Tuesday.The AARP report, which examined the retail prices of the 514 brand name and generic drugs most widely used by Medicare recipients, said that the price of generic drugs fell by nearly 31 percent from 2005 to 2009. But at the same time that brand-name drug prices grew by nearly 41 percent and specialty drugs rose more than 48 percent. The rate of inflation, by contrast, grew by just over 13 percent over the same period.Few dispute that the price of brand name drugs is increasing. “Inflation is alive and well in the drug industry,” said Lawrence Marsh, managing director of equity research at Barclays Capital, who tracks drug prices. He said drug companies had been raising prices on drugs whose patent protections were about to end in an effort to squeeze as much profit as they could before losing market share to generics.'"
"'12-03-07,'1','The Swedish defense research and technology agency has secretly been helping Saudi Arabia build a weapons factory that would produce antitank missiles, Swedish public radio reported Tuesday.

"'12-03-07,'1','WASHINGTON (Reuters) — The House voted on Tuesday to ensure that the United States could impose duties on subsidized goods from China and Vietnam, overwhelmingly rejecting a conservative group’s attempt to portray it as a tax increase.The bill, which was passed 370 to 39 and addresses a court ruling, now goes to President Obama, who is expected to sign it into law. The Senate passed the bill on Monday.“China distorts the free market by giving enormous subsidies to its producers and exporters, and our companies and workers should not be expected to compete against the deep pockets of the Chinese government,” Dave Camp, a Michigan Republican who is chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, said during debate.The Obama administration helped draw up the bipartisan bill after an appeals court ruled in December that the Commerce Department did not have authority to impose countervailing — or antisubsidy — duties on goods from “nonmarket economies.”The decision endangered countervailing duties on about two dozen goods from China and Vietnam worth more than $4 billion in trade, and potential new duties in cases involving solar panels and turbine towers from China.'"
"'12-03-07,'1','The crucial word in “Devotion Study #1 — The American Dancer,” Sarah Michelson’s contribution to the 2012 Whitney Biennial, is “study.” Like much of Ms. Michelson’s work, this one is relentless, formally severe, unafraid to push repetition to extreme ends. But her focus here is even narrower, zoomed in on a detail from last year’s acclaimed, endurance-testing work “Devotion.” For almost 90 minutes, while a metronome ticks, dancers walk backward in circles.They do so across the expanse of the museum’s fourth floor, tracing their loops over a surface painted with a blueprint for the building. At one end, opposite the window onto Madison Avenue, hangs a giant neon-tube portrait of Ms. Michelson, glowing green.Nicole Mannarino is the first to enter and the last to leave. Her blue jumpsuit, slit in a bare V, from neck to waist, has kimono sleeves that suggest wings as she holds her arms out to the side. She circles backward on half-toe, pauses periodically to reset, and continues circling.Eleanor Hullihan arrives, her legs uncovered — the costumes, by Ms. Michelson and James Kidd, are remarkable for their individualized exposure of flesh — and the two women circle together with a precision that grows more incredible as their paths diverge and overlap. Each lowers an arm to avoid a collision.One at a time, three other circlers join in; one at a time, all five circlers depart. (This is not counting the character in the horse’s head from Ms. Michelson’s 2009 work “Dover Beach,” who comes and goes inscrutably.)That’s the gist of the dance, and the dancers’ entrances and exits constitute major events. But so, eventually, do small variations in the circling or quick digressions from it. Very late in the game, a mere torso tilt screams “beauty.” A few leaps forward by Ms. Hullihan seem as shocking as a reversal of gravity.'"
"'12-03-07,'1','Most male models have the shelf life of a bag of potato chips, even shorter if they are familiar with the product. So at age 32, after 12 years in the business of catwalks and ab crunches, Brad Kroenig is about the closest thing there is to a male supermodel.A few weeks ago, Mr. Kroenig got a call from Karl Lagerfeld, for whom he has been something of a muse for eight years. Mr. Lagerfeld was casting models for his fall Chanel show and wondered if Mr. Kroenig might be available.Of course he was!Mr. Lagerfeld was asking for the other Mr. Kroenig: his 3-year-old son, Hudson. It seems young Master Kroenig made quite an impression when he appeared in a Chanel show in 2010, then walking alongside his dad. At 2, he was the talk of Paris Fashion Week. This time, Mr. Lagerfeld said he wanted only Hudson for the show. Sorry, Brad.So father and son boarded a plane on Saturday night, and thanks to Mr. Lagerfeld’s largesse, they were holed up at the Ritz while Hudson prepared for the show on Tuesday morning. Upon meeting the young star, and Mr. Kroenig, too, for coffee and juice in the hotel bar the other day, it was easy to see that the golden-haired tyke was born with a natural modeling ability. It was possible, even, that some passers-by thought him a bit of a diva.“I want to order!” Hudson said. “I order food. I want a hot dog! And cake!”“He’s never even had a hot dog,” Mr. Kroenig said. “You know, we make him eat healthy.”You’ve heard about all that fuss in the states about underage models? Well, in Europe, it’s no big deal. Hudson has already landed a Fendi campaign, in which he nestles himself in the embrace of Anja Rubik.'"
"'12-03-07,'1','UConn (19-12) will play eighth-seeded West Virginia (19-12) in Wednesday’s first game, followed by Pittsburgh (17-15) against No. 5 Georgetown (22-7).With Coach Jim Calhoun stalking the sideline for a second straight game, UConn beat back DePaul after looking heavy-legged in the first half and allowing a 24-point second-half lead shrink to 9 with about seven minutes left.Despite nearly squandering their lead, the Huskies are among the most talented teams in the country, to say nothing of the conference. Yet UConn lost 9 of its final 13 regular-season games, a finish like last season’s.Last year, UConn lost 7 of its final 11 regular-season games. Then came the Big East tournament. Kemba Walker burnished his status as a star, toppling top-seeded Pittsburgh with a jumper at the buzzer, scoring 33 points against Syracuse and running past Louisville for the title.Although they have a cast of likely N.B.A. players, these Huskies do not have Walker or anyone who approaches him. But Lamb scored 25 points, making 10 of 18 shots from the field.“I’m not trying to be Kemba,” Lamb said. “Of course, everyone would want to lead their team to championships. I’m just trying to do what’s best for this team.”UConn’s problem has not been talent. The Huskies returned key pieces of the national title team like Lamb, Shabazz Napier and Alex Oriakhi and added the talented freshman center Andre Drummond. But the uninterested way UConn has played at points this season has been perplexing.On Tuesday, the Huskies seemed sluggish again, especially early on. The offense was not always crisply run, and the defense was often porous.“At this point, you’ve got to build off anything you can,” Oriakhi said. “We’re just trying to go out there and play with a sense of urgency.”The best player on the court all game, Lamb showcased his ability in a variety of ways: making 3-pointers, kissing a layup off the glass after a drive to the rim, dishing to teammates after running the floor on a fast break.But the Huskies hope the return of Calhoun, who had been out since Feb. 3 with back problems before coming back last Saturday, is an answer to their lack of verve. Calhoun has led UConn to three national titles since he took over in 1986.“I’m trying to coach this basketball team,” Calhoun said. “That’s my job. It’s also my love. That’s why I came back for my basketball team. I felt I owed them something.”Calhoun, 69, missed eight games this season because of the effects of spinal stenosis, a narrowing of the spine. He underwent surgery last week in New York that involved removing a large disk fragment that had been pressing on a spinal nerve.UConn’s victory on Tuesday made it two in a row, which had not happened since wins over West Virginia and Notre Dame on Jan. 9 and 14. The victory over the Fighting Irish was the Huskies’ last before their slide leading into this week.But UConn hopes this could be the start of another March full of victories.ST. JOHN’S STUMBLES Lacking depth and experience, St. John’s could not keep up with Pittsburgh, which was led by Ashton Gibbs. He was 4 of 9 from 3-point range and scored 20 points.St. John’s, which was led by Moe Harkless with 25 points and 9 rebounds, ended a season that amounted to a step backward for the program under Steve Lavin.A year after making its first N.C.A.A. tournament appearance since 2002, the Red Storm had several top recruits declared ineligible by the N.C.A.A. and played without Lavin while he recovered from surgery for prostate cancer. Before the game, Lavin reasserted that he would return next season after coaching four games this season.'"
"'12-03-07,'1','The Federal Bureau of Investigation offered a $1 million reward on Tuesday for information about a former F.B.I. agent who disappeared in Iran five years ago.The F.B.I. also said it would have billboards with a picture of the missing man, Robert A. Levinson, put up in Afghanistan, Pakistan and other places in southwest Asia. Fliers and radio announcements are also planned.The effort, announced at a news conference in Washington, is the latest move in the bureau’s long campaign to find Mr. Levinson, who disappeared in March 2007 while on Kish Island, a resort area off the coast of Iran.American officials believe that Mr. Levinson is still alive. But over the past five years, the only substantive information to surface about him was sent to his family, apparently by his captors.After hearing nothing for three years, the family received a videotape in 2010 showing Mr. Levinson sitting in a makeshift prison. In the tape, he said he was being held captive and urged officials in the United States to help him.'"
"'12-03-07,'1','MUSHROOM barley soup, as nubby as oatmeal, is the kind of thing my grandmother used to simmer on the stove all winter long. The barley partly dissolved after a few hours, thickening the broth until it was dense and shiny and slightly sticky.A steaming bowl was perfect to warm a body on a frigid night.Sadly, though, the dearth of such nights in New York City has made me shelve my grandmother’s mushroom barley soup, along with hot chocolate and fondue, until next winter rolls around. Then, with any luck, the icicles will return, and I’ll need to thaw out with comfort food.In the meantime, my appetite yearns for lighter, more springlike fare.Thinking about the soup I wasn’t going to make led me to wonder why there weren’t more recipes combining mushrooms and barley.The two get along extremely well, with the woodsy meatiness of the mushrooms rounding out the starchy softness of the barley. Other than in soup and maybe the odd risotto, I haven’t seen the two sharing the same dish with any regularity.But a barley salad, tossed with browned, crispy mushrooms and, to counter those earth-bound flavors, plenty of fresh scallions and parsley, would unite the two without the heft and heat of a bubbling soup pot.Toasting the barley for this salad is essential. It not only accentuates the nuttiness of the grains, but also helps to keep them separate as they cook. That way, instead of clumping together into a gluey mass, they stay distinct, much like farro (which can be substituted for the barley here; just reduce the cooking time per the package directions).'"

"'12-03-08,'1','An avid fly fisherman who has a Scottish estate, the sheik envisions a Herculean water management project that involves the creation of a salmon run in which the fish can swim upstream to spawn. Not only will it bring his favorite leisure activity closer to home, he declares, but it will also help his people.When the plan is proposed to the British government by the sheik’s assistant, Harriet (Emily Blunt), Patricia seizes on it as an opportunity to distract the public from Middle Eastern conflicts and score political points for her boss.Dr. Alfred Jones (Ewan McGregor), a British fisheries expert who goes by Fred, is approached to evaluate the feasibility of the concept, which would involve importing 10,000 North Atlantic salmon to Yemen from Britain. Believing the plan to be preposterous and impossible to carry out, he dismisses the idea. But Patricia, whose research reveals that two million British voters are fishing buffs, will not let it rest. She pressures Fred’s boss to force his participation.An unexpected uproar ensues when British fishermen learn that their salmon stock will be depleted. It is decided that the only solution is to use farmed salmon, which have no river experience. Thus the big question: Will farmed salmon follow their wild cousins’ instincts and leap upstream?Mr. McGregor has a delicious role in Fred, a buttoned-up, unhappily married bureaucrat whose cold, nasty wife of two decades leaves him for months at a time to conduct business in other places. He develops an unspoken romantic attraction to Harriet, whose boyfriend, Robert (Tom Mison), is fighting overseas. When she receives the news that Robert is missing in action, she falls apart.Whether Harriet and Fred will get together is a question that hovers over the movie. The appeal of the film depends on the charm of Mr. McGregor and Ms. Blunt, whose polite but discreetly charged connection is the story’s emotional center.The uptight Fred is a nifty departure from Mr. McGregor’s typically roguish roles, and he sufficiently camouflages his romantic magnetism to reduce the gleam to a distant twinkle. Ms. Blunt’s Harriet is demure and ravishing.The movie is burdened with a perfunctory subplot in which the sheik becomes the target of an assassination plot by Islamic extremists. The biggest moment of suspense has nothing to do with international politics or terrorism. It comes when those farmed salmon are finally released into the waters of their new home. Will they mill around in confusion or will they jump? It is enough to say that for this moment to be the film’s dramatic turning point is an indication of its softness.“Salmon Fishing in the Yemen” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). Some sexual content, violence and brief strong language.'"

"'12-03-08,'1','Yet by inserting herself into the cut and thrust of Burmese politics, Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi is placing some of her hard-fought prestige on the line.Increasingly, she is being asked to propose solutions to her country’s woes rather than merely lament them. Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi is a consummate intellectual who spent the first decades of her life hopping across the globe. Being elected to Parliament — assuming she wins — will be a test of whether she can help bring prosperity to a constituency that gets its water by pulling buckets out of a well.“There’s an element of gamble and risk for her,” said U Thant Myint-U, the author of several books on Myanmar.“Once she’s won, and pretty much everybody assumes she’ll win, things will be very different,” Mr. Thant Myint-U said. “She will have to deal with a range of issues, from the government’s fiscal policies to health care reform to responding to demands from her constituency for electricity, cheaper phones and more jobs.”Until now, Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi’s life has often been defined by her steely defiance of the military junta and by personal tragedies, starting with the assassination of her father, Gen. Aung San, the founder of the Burmese Army, in 1947 when she was 2.Biographers and filmmakers have tended to emphasize the wrenching decisions in her adult life, including her leaving a comfortable existence in England to pursue her political struggle for democracy here. Her two children remained in England, and her English husband died of cancer there as she rallied resistance to military rule, which ended last year when a nominally civilian government came to power.The transition from critic to policy maker has been a tricky turning point for dissidents in other countries.Her career could follow the trajectory of Vaclav Havel, who after his rise as an intellectual and activist against Communist rule was twice elected president of the Czech Republic. Or she could slump like Lech Walesa, the hard-charging hero of the Solidarity labor movement in the waning days of Polish Communism, who alienated allies and voters, flirting with single-digit percentages in opinion polls during his one-term presidency.One factor for Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi, 66, is her health. The relentless campaign is taking its toll. She fell ill during the trip to Mandalay, cut short a speech and was put on a drip by her doctors.Biographers say she seems to have inherited the dogged personality of her father, who before his assassination was in line to become the first leader of Burma after independence from Britain. Those who have met with Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi since her release from house arrest in late 2010 say she appears driven to play a substantive role in the country’s political future.“I don’t think she wants to be perceived only as an icon,” said Larry M. Dinger, the head of the United States mission here until last August. “She’s a democrat who sees herself as a practical politician.”During the campaign, she has spoken about the need for more jobs, better health care and education. She emphasizes the importance of achieving unity among the country’s many ethnic minorities. But on most issues, Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi rarely delves into specifics. She jokes in speeches that she does not like to make promises.Still, Sean Turnell, one of the leading analysts on Myanmar’s economy, described her as “fluent in the language of economics” and well versed on issues like microfinance and property rights.Myanmar’s economic prospects are uncertain. For a country sandwiched between the rising economies of China and India, poverty is jarringly endemic, especially in rural areas. Oxen pull plows; houses are made of thatch and bamboo.The constituency where Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi is running is a two-hour drive south of Yangon, the country’s main city, and is not as underdeveloped as other parts of the country. But in most areas it remains without a sewerage system, paved roads or cellphone reception. Residents power light bulbs with car batteries, though there are few cars in sight.Years of mismanagement by a corrupt military leadership have left Myanmar without a functioning banking and finance system.By entering politics at this delicate stage, Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi is imparting legitimacy on a government run by the same generals, now retired, whom she battled for two decades. If the reform in Myanmar falters, Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi could be held partly responsible, analysts say.Even if her party, the National League for Democracy, does well in the April 1 elections, her power in Parliament — numerically, at least — will be slight. The 48 constituencies in contention are just a fraction of the more than 600 seats in Parliament.Her party’s main challenger is the Union Solidarity and Development Party, a proxy party for the former military junta. But there are also signs of fracture and disaffection within her wider democracy movement.“I respect her. I like her. But she isn’t the leader of all other democratic forces,” said U Kaung Myint Htut, a candidate running against Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi’s party. “Sometimes we think she is a little self-centered,” he added, accusing her of acting like a queen who does not consult other democracy activists.Bertil Lintner, one of Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi’s biographers, predicted future fissures as her party entered the political system.“As long as they were suppressed and almost banned, they remained united,” he said. “Once the pressure comes off, all sorts of conflicts and contradictions will come to the surface.”Whatever bickering exists, it does not seem to be diminishing Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi’s standing among voters.“I am the head of the village, so it’s hard for me to say this directly,” said U Khin Tint, a local official in her constituency. “But I don’t see any competition.”'"
"'12-03-08,'1','He built his miniature submarine secretly in , and already it has outdone all other watercraft in its ability to ferry people through the deep’s crushing pressures. As with the birth of the private space rocket industry, where commercial companies are building ships to take astronauts aloft, the debut of Mr. Cameron’s submarine signals the rising importance of entrepreneurs in the global race to advance science and technology.His goal with his next dive is to tackle a much older record. A half century ago, in a technical feat never equaled, the sent two men down nearly seven miles into the Challenger Deep, their vehicle 60 feet long. A window cracked on the way down. The landing stirred up so much ooze that the divers could see little through the portholes, took no pictures and began their ascent after just 20 minutes on the seabed.Mr. Cameron’s bid is to be unveiled Thursday in by the , where he holds the title of Explorer-in-Residence. Both the society, which is helping pay for the expedition, and Mr. Cameron took pains to characterize the effort as purely scientific rather than competitive.It comes as a number of wealthy men — including of the Virgin empire and the Internet guru — are building or financing miniature submarines meant to transport them, their friends and scientists into the remotest parts of the world’s oceans, including the Challenger Deep.Mr. Cameron will collect samples for research in biology, microbiology, astrobiology, marine geology and geophysics. “The science is paramount,” Ellen Stanley, a National Geographic spokeswoman, said in an interview. “We’re out to learn what’s down there.”Mr. Cameron called his venture “very different from going down and planting a flag” — a seeming reference to how Russian explorers in 2007 put a flag on the seabed under the North Pole. Their deed was meant to strengthen ’s claims to nearly half the seabed.The Challenger Deep is in the Mariana Trench, the deepest of the many seabed recesses that crisscross the globe. Over the decades, biologists have glimpsed their unfamiliar inhabitants mainly by lowering dredges on long lines. Up have come thousands of strange-looking worms and sea cucumbers. More recently, robot cameras have spied ghostly fish with sinuous tails.Aboard Mr. Cameron’s expedition is Douglas Bartlett, a professor of marine microbial at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, an arm of the . Last year, Dr. Bartlett led a team that dropped cameras into the Mariana Trench and observed giant amoebas — a first in the inhospitable zone. Known as xenophyophores, these mysterious life forms consist of a single cell and appear able to grow to the size of a fist. Scientists find them exclusively in the deep sea.National Geographic said the public would be able to follow Mr. Cameron’s expedition at www.deepseachallenge.com. It described the project’s main science collaborator as Scripps, followed by the , ’s and the University of Guam. The film director has long exhibited a fascination with the deep sea, making (1989), “Titanic” (1997) and a number of documentaries about lost ships, including (2002) and (2003), a 3-D tour of the ’s interior. National Geographic said that Mr. Cameron had now made a total of 76 submersible dives, including 33 to the famous luxury liner.The crew capsules of submersibles are made small to better withstand tons of crushing pressure, and thus have no amenities. Mr. Cameron’s solo model is unusually small, its inner diameter less than four feet.He said the vehicle over all had many cameras but only one thick porthole, its inner diameter three inches. He described the craft as a “vertical torpedo,” meant to fall and rise quickly so as to maximize time for exploring the seabed.“You’d be an idiot not to be apprehensive, but I trust the design,” Mr. Cameron said as he contemplated his impending dive. “You’re going into one of the most unforgiving places on earth.”He said the deaths early last month of his two crew members, Mike deGruy and Andrew Wight — both celebrated filmmakers who specialized in carrying viewers into the sea’s depths — initially prompted him to want to scrap the expedition. The two were preparing to film a sea trial of the Deepsea Challenger when their helicopter went down shortly after takeoff from an airstrip south of , Australia.“It was a horrible day,” Mr. Cameron recalled. “We felt sick at heart. It caused us to question risk and the meaning of life. I personally did not want to continue at that point, but the team rallied.”Mr. Cameron said the project, if successful, will result not only in a number of new scientific findings but two documentary films — one a 3-D production for wide-screen theaters, and the other a National Geographic TV special.He said that he would take some protein bars with him for the historic dive, but that much of his space was taken up with digital recording decks.“It’s full of electronics,” Mr. Cameron said. “It’s tight, like a Mercury space capsule.”'"

"'12-03-08,'1','A United Nations investigator of Iran’s human rights record castigated its government for what he called evidence of “a striking pattern of violations of fundamental human rights guaranteed under international law.” A 36-page report by the investigator, Ahmed Shaheed, a special rapporteur for the Human Rights Council, catalogued numerous examples, including violations of due process in the courts, illegal detentions, extensive accusations of torture of prisoners, and maltreatment of dissidents, minorities, journalists and women. The report praised Iran for omitting stoning as a form of capital punishment in its new penal code, but it faulted the country for its large number of executions, mostly in drug cases, which increased to at least 670 cases last year from 100 in 2003.It also criticized a bill under consideration in Parliament that would allow men to enter into temporary marriages without the knowledge or permission of their wives. Iran had previously objected to the appointment of a special investigator of its rights record and said the inquiry reflected what it called “Western espionage agencies, Zionist elements and terrorist groups.” It has not permitted Mr. Shaheed to visit the country, which he acknowledged in the report, saying the restriction required that he fulfill his mandate “on the basis of voluminous information collected from a variety of independent and reliable sources.”'"
"'12-03-08,'1','A Netflix spokesman declined to comment on discussions with cable operators, but said Mr. Hastings’s comments in San Francisco were “futuristic.”The nascent negotiations with cable operators, first reported by Reuters, underscore how Netflix has evolved. Once, on the strength of its popular DVD-by-mail service and emerging streaming offerings, the company was viewed as a rival to cable giants like Comcast and Time Warner Cable, the kind that could lead to widespread cord-cutting.Netflix has stumbled, however, in obtaining rights to stream television shows and movies, and as the company has added streaming subscribers, it has lost subscribers to its DVD service.At the same time, competitors have emerged. Last month, Comcast began an online streaming service called Streampix. The service is now available to Comcast’s 22.3 million Xfinity subscribers, but the company has the reach to one day expand the service beyond its customer base.Also last month, Verizon said it would partner with Coinstar’s Redbox on a Web streaming service at a monthly rate of $4.99, compared with $7.99 for unlimited streaming on Netflix. The $79-a-year Amazon Prime service, which also offers shipping and Kindle benefits, has licensing deals with major television networks and movie studios. And Time Warner’s HBO Go, a streaming service available only to HBO subscribers, has been cited by Mr. Hastings as Netflix’s biggest competitor.Partnering with a major cable operator would instantly increase the number of subscribers to Netflix, which currently has about 21.7 million streaming subscribers in the United States, according to the company.Netflix may let cable partners handle monthly billing while still relying on the Web for delivering shows and movies. The company said Wednesday that it had struck a similar arrangement with Apple TV that lets viewers sign up for Netflix and pay via their iTunes accounts.A Netflix partnership could manifest itself as an additional on-demand service through a traditional set-top box or allow customers to subscribe to Netflix through their cable providers.But subscribers would stay only if Netflix mimics its pay-cable competitors with high-quality original series and exclusive movies, analysts said. Without original content, they said, there is a chance that cable operators will shun a potential partnership.“If Netflix is going to more closely resemble a cable network, we believe it will need to acquire more exclusive content and also push more into development of original programs,” Anthony DiClemente, a Barclays Capital analyst, wrote in a report titled “Is Netflix Becoming a Cable Network?”Last month, Netflix struck an exclusive deal with the Weinstein Company to offer films like “The Artist” and “Undefeated,” both of which won Oscars. Its anticipated original series “House of Cards,” a political drama based on a BBC miniseries, will arrive this year.HBO, meanwhile, has 29 million subscribers in the United States and original movies and television series that attract critical acclaim and international revenue. The network took off by offering exclusive recently released movies, boxing matches and comedy and concert specials.That is a different proposition from Netflix, which has evolved into a service for reruns of television series like “Mad Men,” “Lost” and “Breaking Bad,” rather than current feature films. Last week, its three-and-a-half-year deal with Starz ended, taking with it movies like “Toy Story 3” and “Scarface.”If Netflix succeeds in forging new partnerships with major cable operators, customers will not see the results any time soon. Netflix’s rights agreements would need to be renegotiated and would only get trickier if the company paired up with cable providers, analysts said. Hollywood studios currently view cable companies and Netflix as separate sources of revenue.“As we’ve seen, the content guys can be prickly,” said Barton Crockett, a media analyst at Lazard Capital Markets. “If Netflix has twice as many subscribers, they’ll look for twice as much money.”On Wednesday, trading in Netflix closed at $105.19, down $1.94. Its 52-week high was $304.79.'"
"'12-03-08,'1','WASHINGTON — A day after the authorities arrested several hackers from the Anonymous movement, the director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Robert S. Mueller III, warned members of Congress that terrorist groups might use hackers to attack the United States.“Terrorists have shown interest in pursuing hacking skills,” Mr. Mueller said Wednesday in written testimony to a House appropriations subcommittee reviewing the bureau’s budget. “And they may seek to train their own recruits or hire outsiders, with an eye toward pursuing cyberattacks. These adaptations of the terrorist threat make the F.B.I.’s counterterrorism mission that much more difficult and challenging.”Mr. Mueller said that the federal government must act swiftly to prevent such attacks and economic espionage from other countries because they pose a “potentially devastating” threat to the country’s businesses and infrastructure.“We tend to focus on protecting our databases, protecting our infrastructure, which is absolutely an appropriate focus,” he said. “But we should not forget that you want to identify these individuals who are responsible for these crimes, investigate them, prosecute them and put them in jail for a substantial period of time.”Mr. Mueller has been particularly vocal over the past week about the issue of hacking and cybersecurity. Last Thursday at the RSA computer security conference in San Francisco, Mr. Mueller said that a terrorist had proclaimed in a recruiting video “that cyberwarfare will be the warfare of the future.”Anonymous embarrassed the F.B.I. in February when it posted a 16-minute recording of a conference between the bureau and law enforcement officials in Europe about their joint investigation into the hackers. The group has supported the whistle-blower site WikiLeaks and has claimed responsibility for hacking the Web site of a law firm that represented a Marine accused of killing unarmed civilians in Haditha, Iraq, in 2005.On Tuesday, federal prosecutors in New York revealed that a leading hacker known as Sabu had been cooperating with the federal authorities, helping them to arrest several “hactivists” for Anonymous in the United States and Europe. Sabu was identified in court papers as Hector Xavier Monsegur, a 28-year-old who operated from a sixth-floor apartment on the Lower East Side of Manhattan.'"

Getting into the hall was even one caper that neither Jesse James nor Calamity Jane could pull off.But please make way for Rush Limbaugh, the conservative radio host whose planned entry into the hall has prompted an outcry.Armed with the latest batch of his derisive comments — Mr. Limbaugh called a law student who testified before Congress in favor of access to contraception “a slut” and “a prostitute,” remarks for which he later apologized — Democrats and progressive groups are waging an uphill campaign to exclude the talk radio king from the pantheon of notable sons and daughters of the Show Me State.“People are really upset with the idea that such a controversial, divisive and hateful person would be in a position of such honor,” said Sean Soendker Nicholson, executive director of Progress Missouri, which has been leading the opposition effort.Steven Tilley, the speaker of the Missouri House, who enjoys sole discretion on whom to add to the collection of several dozen bronze busts in the Capitol rotunda, said he had no intention of changing his mind. The busts, which cost $10,000 each, are paid for with private donations.“By any measurement he’s a famous Missourian,” said Mr. Tilley, a Republican, who has been inundated by calls and e-mails protesting the move. “And in my part of the state we’re proud of him.”The current inductees include Mark Twain, George Washington Carver, Harry S.

"'12-03-08,'1','“It was a tiny preview of a trait he would grow famous for in business: emotion-free crisis management,” Swidey wrote.People, does any of this sound appealing? Elect Mitt Romney and he will take the nation on the road to the future. Some of us will be stuck on the roof. The rest of us will be inside singing camp songs and waiting for the day when the master plan lets us stop to visit the bathroom. Plus, anybody who screws up on the way to the future gets the hose.Anyhow, we are now at a post-Super-Tuesday lull in the campaign, and I am ready to answer Seamus questions.Haven’t you brought this episode up like about 10 million times already?I’ve made a kind of game of trying to mention Seamus every time I write about Mitt Romney. This is because the Republican primary campaign has been an extremely long and depressing slog, and we need all the diversion we can get.It’s as though you’re saying this is the most important fact about a possible future president of the .You could argue that the Seamus story puts Romney in a more human context. This is not just a quarter-billionaire with approximately the same gift for the common touch as Scrooge McDuck. This is a real person. A person who once drove to Canada with the family dog tied to the roof of the car.“This is a completely airtight kennel, mounted on the top of our car. He climbed up there regularly, enjoyed himself,” Romney told Chris Wallace in a Fox interview that began with Wallace, a dog owner, demanding: “What were you thinking?”Wait a minute, if the kennel was airtight, how did Seamus breathe?Excellent question. Also hard to envision the animal continually trying to leap on top of the station wagon in order to enjoy its delights.So that’s it from Romney?He did once suggest that the Seamus publicity was a plot by to get even with him for allowing rodeo performances at the Winter Olympics in .I bet would never put Bo on top of a car.Yes, the Obama campaign has been eager to point this out. Although, really, if you’re the president of the United States, you can give the dog his own helicopter if you want to.I should note that when it comes to presidents and dogs, Romney would have to go a long way to match , who once held up his beagles by the ears for photographers.Is it even legal to drive around with a dog on top of your car?Chris Wallace did ask Romney if he knew that he was breaking a law against cruelty to animals. Mitt did his heh-heh-heh thing and pleaded ignorance. The law is actually kind of vague. But I will point out that a member of a group called Dogs Against Romney drove to a protest in with a model of Seamus on top of his car and was stopped by the police.I heard a rumor that when the family got to Canada, Seamus ran away.Seeking sanctuary? Mitt’s sister Jane told Swidey that the dog developed a tendency to wander, and that she took Seamus to her home in where there was more space. She also gave The Globe an extremely cute picture of Seamus cuddling with some kittens.Does Romney have a dog now? I’m not sure I want to see Seamus II in the White House.Romney occasionally says, “We love our pets. Heh. Heh. Heh.” The Romney camp hates talking about Seamus-related issues, but there’s no evidence of an actual family dog at the present. If there is one, I’d hate to think of how it travels when they fly between campaign stops.'"

"'12-03-08,'1','But it appears probable that a trial will start March 19 when a federal judge, Jed S. Rakoff, will question prospective jurors to impanel a 6- to 12-person jury.“Anytime your fate is in the hands of a jury, it’s a big risk,” said Bradley Simon, a former federal prosecutor who is a partner at Simon & Partners. “Jurors are not likely to be that sympathetic to individuals like them who are financially well off and did well with their Madoff investments. “Lawyers for the team argued unsuccessfully, on constitutional grounds, against a jury trial.Rakoff, regarded as a brilliant but unpredictable jurist, alone will question the jury pool. He is a Yankees fan and a partial season-ticket holder. So his neutrality is assured and seems unlikely to be affected by his rooting interests. Anyway, the role of the opposing lawyers in shaping the makeup of the jury will be somewhat limited.Experts suggest that both sides probably already know the sort of jury makeup they want, and that mock trials have likely yielded juror profiles. But neither side will get all it wants.“The real challenge is to ferret out latent prejudices, so it’s extremely important for lawyers to suggest questions to the judge beyond those the judge would use to elicit obvious biases,” said Mark Zauderer, a partner at Flemming Zulack Williamson Zauderer in Manhattan. Rakoff need not use their questions.According to several lawyers and a jury consultant, the trustee will want jurors who resent millionaires.But Wilpon and Katz’s team, they said, probably want less class-conscious people who might be more inclined to feel the trustee’s pursuit of the Mets’ owners was overzealous and unfair. The trustee has accused the owners of ignoring warning signs about Madoff’s operation as they benefited from steady returns during their many years of investing with him.“If they get some Wall Street types on the jury, or partners of big law firms, they might feel this is another attack on wealth,” said Annemarie McAvoy, a former federal prosecutor who is a professor at Fordham Law School. “But if they seek sympathy, they have to come off sympathetically.”Wilpon and Katz’s wealth is likely to be a recurring theme at what the judge has said will be a 10-day trial. They had a lot of it, and invested much of it with Madoff.Wilpon and Katz, who are brothers-in-law, built their company, Sterling Equities, out of investments in real estate, sports and private equity. They poured $1.6 billion into their Madoff accounts over 23 years.Their riches, then, could cut two ways. The financial crash and the Occupy Wall Street protest movement have made the rich less sympathetic than ever; some now pejoratively label the wealthy the one percent.Simon said that jurors’ resentments of wealthy defendants is not always easy to discern.“People say it won’t influence but they don’t really say it,” he said.The owners would be fortunate to find a juror who has been betrayed in his life — or at least has a sense of fair play about people whose wealth is well beyond theirs, the experts said.Philip Aidikoff, a partner in the securities firm Aidikoff, Uhl & Bakhtiari in Los Angeles, said, “Some of our clients are far wealthier than Wilpon and we say, ‘Our client is wealthy beyond belief? So what? Can you lie to them? Give them false information?’ ” He has represented clients defrauded by Madoff.Although a jury will decide the case, Rakoff can exercise broad influence on the evidence and testimony he allows into the record. He is not shy about voicing his opinions, no more so than in his tartly worded rejections of the Securities and Exchange Commission’s settlements of major bank cases.In his decision on Monday to clear the path for the trial of the Mets’ owners, he questioned the trustee’s ability to prove that Wilpon and Katz acted in bad faith and described some of the “bombshells” submitted recently by both sides in the case as evidence “proved to be nothing but bombast,” and may not be admissible.McAvoy said: “I know Judge Rakoff. He’s tough, he’s very good, and he’s very astute. He won’t give much leeway. They have to present the evidence right or it won’t come down.”'"
"'12-03-08,'1','“What matters is after-tax wealth,” said Michael A. Dubis, a fee-only certified financial planner in Madison, Wis. “I will tell clients if their return expectations don’t make sense. Hope is not a strategy.”Mr. Dubis sees a policy statement as part of a coordinated financial planning process. Although most advisers are generally focused on investments, they can also work with tax, estate and insurance advisers on protecting your assets and helping them grow over time.To draft a policy statement, you need to determine your investment philosophy. What kind of investor should you be? Can you afford to be aggressive? Maybe not, if your income is tied to a volatile industry like financial services. Are you an active or passive investor? Trading is rarely a good idea when hundreds of index funds are available, offering broad exposure to nearly every market.Advisers should include in the statement their style of money management, how much they charge, their responsibilities and a periodic review schedule. They may even include some language on what they won’t or can’t do — like estate planning or tax planning — although they often coordinate with other professionals. Even computerized Monte Carlo analyses of the probability of achieving your goals are useful.Once you review your objectives, what you own, how you want to invest and risk and return expectations over given time periods, you can sit down with your planner to construct a portfolio that’s right for you. The amateur investment group Bogleheads provides an excellent introduction to the process.A draft portfolio is a synthesis of the information you supply your planner. A sample might stress long-term growth in United States and international stocks, along with bonds, real estate investment trusts and inflation-protected securities.Larry Swedroe, director of research for Buckingham Asset Management in St. Louis, said people needed to do some self-analysis and chat with family members before the final statement was in place.“You need to separate desires from needs,” said Mr. Swedroe, who wrote “The Only Guide You’ll Ever Need for the Right Financial Plan” (Bloomberg Press 2010). “It’s critical to integrate your plan with taxes, estate planning and insurance needs. It’s a necessary condition for success, but not a sufficient one.”Mr. Swedroe recommends that clients also do a mind map, which is like a flow chart that shows relationships among family members, assets, advisers, interests, values and goals.While this process sounds tedious and time-consuming — it can take up to four meetings to draft and review a policy statement with your adviser — it is worthwhile because it may address needs you’ve never discussed with your family or advisers.What do you do if the market dives just before your retirement? Can you save more? What if you have to support an aging relative? What if you sell some real estate and downsize? Your statement can be adjusted as you go along.At the very least, your adviser should be able to tell you the worst- and best-case range of returns given your investment allocation. That way, you can insulate your portfolio from a dismal year like 2008.A few paragraphs on how your adviser will manage your money is also essential before you actually build the portfolio. If his or her objectives differ from yours, you need to discuss it. Do you want an actively managed, aggressive growth strategy? Or are you more focused on capital preservation and income? Don’t stay with an adviser whose approach doesn’t match your needs.Like any moving vehicle, an investment policy statement needs regular care, maintenance and rebalancing. It should be flexible to accommodate changes in your life: divorces, aging parents, inheritances. As the route of your journey changes, you may need a new road map.'"
"'12-03-08,'1','Because of their high payouts, REITs have gained increasing favor with income investors. While they can move in the opposite direction of the stock market, they often move in the same direction, as they did in 2008. So they carry significant market risk. If you want to avoid the struggling property market in the United States, two worthy considerations that sample REITs across the globe are the SPDR DJ Wilshire International REIT exchange-traded fund (RWX) and the iShares S&P Developed World ex-U.S. Property Index (WPS).It’s also worthwhile to look beyond developed countries for income. With debt woes beleaguering the United States and the euro zone, emerging markets have garnered more attention.“Many emerging economies are facing fewer headwinds than the more developed economies,” said Richard K. Fullmer, an asset allocation strategist with the mutual fund company T. Rowe Price. “Emerging market bonds are attractive relative to developed markets.”The Powershares Emerging Markets Sovereign Debt Portfolio (PCY) and the Market Vectors Emerging Markets Local Currency Bond ETF (EMLC) sample undeveloped debt markets. Unlike domestic bond funds, emerging markets funds carry currency and political risk, although those risks may be muted in a diversified portfolio.Another category traditionally thought to be verboten by conservative income investors is high-yield or “junk” bonds. These corporate issues, given low credit ratings because they have a higher risk of default, have gained renewed attention in the last year. The reason is simple: As the economy improves, default risks on these bonds generally decline. For the increased risk you are taking, you are offered yields several points higher than blue-chip corporate bonds.Douglas Wolfe, chief investment officer of Saddle River Capital Management, said he placed his clients in high-yield bond E.T.F.’s such as the PIMCO 0-5 year High Yield Corporate Bond Index Fund (HYS) and the iShares iBoxx High-Yield Corporate Bond Fund (HYG).Mr. Wolfe also recommends another asset often overlooked by yield-hungry investors: master limited partnerships contained within E.T.F.’s. Partnerships own physical assets such as pipelines and toll roads that generate income streams for investors. Although buying individual partnerships can be risky and expensive, when several of them are managed within a portfolio, diversification lowers the volatility. Mr. Wolfe favors the Alerian Master Limited Partnership E.T.F. (AMLP).You will find that balancing the different kinds of risk can be daunting when assembling a portfolio of nontraditional income vehicles. They are all vulnerable to interest-rate risk and inflation risk to some degree. Market analysts have been warning for years that high inflation may return because of all the sovereign debt being sold.“Interest rates are extremely low now,” adds Mr. Fullmer. “At some point, rates will go up and prices will fall. Investors should be concerned about inflation.”The best way to manage bond market risk? As with holding stocks, you need to look at total portfolio risk and the potential losses associated with what you own. What happens to your holdings if interest rates jump one percentage point, also known as “duration” risk?If you cannot directly measure your overall risk — or tax — exposure, you need to consult a certified financial planner, chartered financial analyst or registered investment adviser. These fiduciary advisers should be able to gauge how much risk you are taking and whether it is appropriate for you given your age, lifestyle and personal preferences.The best thing about holding bonds is their steady income, but there is never a free lunch if you want more yield. It is best to educate yourself now to avoid nasty surprises later.'"
"'12-03-08,'1','At a company event, Apple also showed a new version of Apple TV, the company’s $99 set-top box for accessing Internet video, which streams movies in the sharpest of the high-definition video formats, called 1080p.The initial reaction to the tablet computer was mixed, as has frequently been the case of late with Apple’s new iterations. Apple’s stock price was about flat in regular trading, ending up 43 cents higher, at $530.69, a 0.1 percent gain.The new tablet, called simply the new iPad, with no numbers or letters after the name, is an effort to keep growth chugging along in a two-year-old business that has turned into a major franchise for the company. Apple’s $9.15 billion in iPad sales over the holiday quarter was almost double the amount of revenue reported from its Windows software and not far from ’s total revenue as a company during the same period.Speaking from the same stage where , the company’s late chief executive, introduced the second-generation iPad almost exactly a year ago, the company’s new chief executive, , said the iPad last quarter outsold the number of personal computers sold by any individual manufacturer.“In many ways, the iPad is reinventing portable computing and outstripping the wildest predictions,” Mr. Cook said.The new iPad, the third generation of the device, is nearly indistinguishable from its predecessor, though it is slightly heavier and thicker. The most visible of its changes is the screen, which can display text and images that appear as sharp as they would on a printed page. The company said the screen has more than 3.1 million pixels, or four times more than the current iPad.It will also operate on the fourth-generation cellphone network technology known as LTE. In the , the new iPad will work on ’s and ’s networks to get data.The iPad will also allow users to dictate e-mail, though Apple did not introduce an iPad version of Siri, a voice-command virtual-assistant feature that proved popular on the iPhone 4S.Last fall, Apple disappointed some pundits and enthusiasts by making mostly incremental enhancements with the iPhone 4S. That product ended up squashing doubts to become a smash hit, leading to record sales over the holidays. During that time, Apple, based in Cupertino, Calif., solidified its lead as the most valuable company in the world, with a market capitalization of almost a half-trillion dollars, well ahead of its nearest rival, .At times, Apple has wowed people by radically rethinking the design of its products. Several years ago, it overhauled its MacBook Air with a drastically thinner case. It gave the iPhone 4 a novel, hard-edged case that looked very different from the design of early iPhones.Charles Wolf, an analyst at Needham & Company, said those kinds of radical redesigns did not happen every year, partly because the smaller components and other underlying technologies that made them possible did not change at that pace. Mr. Wolf said he believed that more of Apple’s innovation was happening in software because it was not as encumbered by the development of outside technologies in that area.“I always look at Apple as a software company,” he said.The new iPad may show how durable Apple’s hold on the tablet market is. For most of the two years the iPad has been on sale, Apple has faced a phalanx of competitors from , , Samsung and Motorola, yet none has established a firm beachhead in the tablet business. A few of those competitors, like H.P., gave up.In a recent survey of American consumers with tablets by , 73 percent said they owned an iPad. That is a sharp contrast to the smartphone business, where Apple’s market share has steadily eroded as phones based on Google’s operating system have swept the market. Phones with Android software accounted for 51.6 percent of smartphone shipments worldwide in the fourth quarter, compared with 23.4 percent for the iPhone, according to Canalys, a research firm.Sarah Rotman Epps, an analyst at Forrester, said the iPad had maintained its grip on the market because most consumers bought it through retail stores rather than wireless carriers. “Android smartphones are selling like hot cakes because that’s what the carriers push,” she said. “With tablets, carriers are not the main destination for tablets.”The new iPad, though, is likely to face more serious challenges to the product’s dominance than in the past. Over the holidays, is estimated to have sold more than five million of its Kindle Fire, a smaller tablet that has attracted a new group of consumers to the category with a $199 price tag.Later this year, the first tablet devices to use Windows 8, a new operating system from Microsoft, are expected to hit the market. The software has been redesigned by Microsoft to take advantage of touch-screen devices.Apple sold 15.4 million iPads over the holiday quarter and has sold 55 million iPads in total since they first went on sale in 2010.Mr. Cook told the audience Wednesday that Apple had sold 315 million iOS devices through the end of 2011 and that iPads, iPhones and iPods were now responsible for 75 percent of the company’s revenue. The chief criticism that some stalwarts of the PC industry have leveled at the iPad is that the device is not well suited for creating content, even if it is good for consuming it.Apple, though, sought to undermine that argument with a number of new apps. Those include a new version of its Mac software for editing digital photographs, iPhoto. A new version of Apple’s GarageBand software lets up to four people play together in a virtual band with iPads that are connected wirelessly.'"
"'12-03-08,'1','“That is the only way to do it,” Mr. Marchionne said at the auto show. “There has to be some production taken out.”Mr. Marchionne, who besides running two of the world’s biggest car companies is president of the European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association, estimated that the industry needed to cut capacity in Europe by 20 percent. That is a huge number considering that the car industry directly employs 2.3 million people in Europe, including subcontractors, according to the manufacturers’ association.Unused capacity is ruinous for car companies because even idle factories cost money to maintain and unproductive workers must be paid. In addition, the oversupply of cars drives down prices. Mr. Marchionne said the glut of capacity had forced European carmakers into a “discount binge” similar to what happened in the United States in 2007 and 2008.“You can’t keep that up for long,” Mr. Marchionne said. “You’ll go bankrupt.” That is, in fact, what happened to Chrysler and General Motors.Mr. Marchionne and Mr. Ghosn were reluctant to point fingers, but to analysts it is pretty obvious which companies are under the most pressure to confront overcapacity. They are G.M.’s Opel unit and PSA Peugeot Citroën, both of which suffered huge losses last year.Karl-Friedrich Stracke, the chief executive of Opel, acknowledged as much in a meeting with reporters on Tuesday. He estimated that Opel, based in Germany with factories in Britain and several other countries, was operating at about 80 percent of capacity.Mr. Stracke made no claim that an alliance with PSA Peugeot Citroën to jointly develop and purchase components, announced last week, would solve the capacity problems. “PSA has to address their problems, and we have to address ours,” he said. “There is a high urgency to get our company back to sustainable production. There is no other way out.”Mr. Stracke deflected questions about plant closings, saying that the company was in intensive discussions with “stakeholders” — code for workers and political leaders — about what to do. He said it would be several months before they reached any agreements.Production capacity in Europe fell only a little after the downturn in 2009. Last year, Fiat closed a plant in Sicily, and Saab in Sweden went bankrupt. Opel shut down a plant in Antwerp, Belgium. But a large production overhang remains.When Mr. Ghosn said that all the car companies in Europe suffered from overcapacity, he was presumably not including the premium automakers. Bayerische Motoren Werke, Daimler’s Mercedes-Benz unit and Volkswagen’s Audi unit are operating all-out to meet demand from China, the United States and strong European markets like Germany.The bifurcation between thriving premium car builders and suffering mass-market companies is similar to the divide that exists in Europe between countries with stronger economies, like Germany, and struggling countries, like Italy and Spain.The premium carmakers suffered capacity problems during the recession of 2008, but learned from that experience and have become better at managing fluctuations in demand. BMW, for example, makes heavy use of temporary labor. Other companies, like Porsche, outsource production of some models.Probably the most important reason that premium carmakers do not have capacity problems is that they have been able to sell more cars even as the overall market in Europe has slumped.BMW said Wednesday that it had had its best February ever, with sales rising 14 percent from a year earlier, to almost 128,000 cars, including the Mini and Rolls-Royce brands. Almost all of the growth for BMW was in Asia, where sales rose 35 percent, and North and South America, where they increased 26 percent. Sales were stagnant in Europe.By contrast, sales by mass-market carmakers like Renault or Fiat tend to be skewed to some of the most vulnerable markets, including France or Italy. In January, registrations of new cars in France plunged 21 percent from a year earlier while in Italy they fell 17 percent, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association.The mass-market carmakers also offer luxury models, but they have had trouble competing with the established German brands. “That is our weakness,” Mr. Ghosn said. A new model is in the works that will help Renault capture more affluent buyers, he said.But it is unlikely that luxury Renaults or Opels will help solve those companies’ overcapacity problems. It would take years to gain a share of the high-end market. “If you want to be a big player in premium, you need patience: it took Audi 10 or 15 years,” Peter Schwarzenbauer, the director of marketing at the company, said.Mr. Schwarzenbauer attributed Audi’s upscale position to a decision years ago to focus on making cars that were leaders in technology. The company never wavered from that strategy, he said.“You have to stick to what you believe in,” he said. “You never know if it’s going to work.”'"
"'12-03-08,'1','Yet by inserting herself into the cut and thrust of Burmese politics, Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi is placing some of her hard-fought prestige on the line.Increasingly, she is being asked to propose solutions to her country’s woes rather than merely lament them. Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi is a consummate intellectual who spent the first decades of her life hopping across the globe. Being elected to Parliament — assuming she wins — will be a test of whether she can help bring prosperity to a constituency that gets its water by pulling buckets out of a well.“There’s an element of gamble and risk for her,” said U Thant Myint-U, the author of several books on Myanmar.“Once she’s won, and pretty much everybody assumes she’ll win, things will be very different,” Mr. Thant Myint-U said. “She will have to deal with a range of issues, from the government’s fiscal policies to health care reform to responding to demands from her constituency for electricity, cheaper phones and more jobs.”Until now, Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi’s life has often been defined by her steely defiance of the military junta and by personal tragedies, starting with the assassination of her father, Gen. Aung San, the founder of the Burmese Army, in 1947 when she was 2.Biographers and filmmakers have tended to emphasize the wrenching decisions in her adult life, including her leaving a comfortable existence in England to pursue her political struggle for democracy here. Her two children remained in England, and her English husband died of cancer there as she rallied resistance to military rule, which ended last year when a nominally civilian government came to power.The transition from critic to policy maker has been a tricky turning point for dissidents in other countries.Her career could follow the trajectory of Vaclav Havel, who after his rise as an intellectual and activist against Communist rule was twice elected president of the Czech Republic. Or she could slump like Lech Walesa, the hard-charging hero of the Solidarity labor movement in the waning days of Polish Communism, who alienated allies and voters, flirting with single-digit percentages in opinion polls during his one-term presidency.One factor for Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi, 66, is her health. The relentless campaign is taking its toll. She fell ill during the trip to Mandalay, cut short a speech and was put on a drip by her doctors.Biographers say she seems to have inherited the dogged personality of her father, who before his assassination was in line to become the first leader of Burma after independence from Britain. Those who have met with Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi since her release from house arrest in late 2010 say she appears driven to play a substantive role in the country’s political future.“I don’t think she wants to be perceived only as an icon,” said Larry M. Dinger, the head of the United States mission here until last August. “She’s a democrat who sees herself as a practical politician.”During the campaign, she has spoken about the need for more jobs, better health care and education. She emphasizes the importance of achieving unity among the country’s many ethnic minorities. But on most issues, Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi rarely delves into specifics. She jokes in speeches that she does not like to make promises.Still, Sean Turnell, one of the leading analysts on Myanmar’s economy, described her as “fluent in the language of economics” and well versed on issues like microfinance and property rights.Myanmar’s economic prospects are uncertain. For a country sandwiched between the rising economies of China and India, poverty is jarringly endemic, especially in rural areas. Oxen pull plows; houses are made of thatch and bamboo.The constituency where Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi is running is a two-hour drive south of Yangon, the country’s main city, and is not as underdeveloped as other parts of the country. But in most areas it remains without a sewerage system, paved roads or cellphone reception. Residents power light bulbs with car batteries, though there are few cars in sight.Years of mismanagement by a corrupt military leadership have left Myanmar without a functioning banking and finance system.By entering politics at this delicate stage, Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi is imparting legitimacy on a government run by the same generals, now retired, whom she battled for two decades. If the reform in Myanmar falters, Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi could be held partly responsible, analysts say.Even if her party, the National League for Democracy, does well in the April 1 elections, her power in Parliament — numerically, at least — will be slight. The 48 constituencies in contention are just a fraction of the more than 600 seats in Parliament.Her party’s main challenger is the Union Solidarity and Development Party, a proxy party for the former military junta. But there are also signs of fracture and disaffection within her wider democracy movement.“I respect her. I like her. But she isn’t the leader of all other democratic forces,” said U Kaung Myint Htut, a candidate running against Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi’s party. “Sometimes we think she is a little self-centered,” he added, accusing her of acting like a queen who does not consult other democracy activists.Bertil Lintner, one of Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi’s biographers, predicted future fissures as her party entered the political system.“As long as they were suppressed and almost banned, they remained united,” he said. “Once the pressure comes off, all sorts of conflicts and contradictions will come to the surface.”Whatever bickering exists, it does not seem to be diminishing Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi’s standing among voters.“I am the head of the village, so it’s hard for me to say this directly,” said U Khin Tint, a local official in her constituency. “But I don’t see any competition.”'"
"'12-03-08,'1','Mr. Panetta, who spoke alongside General Dempsey, told the committee that military review was in the earliest stages. “We have not done the detailed planning because we are waiting for the direction of the president to do that,” he said. Modern commanders in chief have routinely asked for military options during foreign crises, and the Pentagon as part of its daily business draws up contingency plans for a wide range of potential conflicts.Mr. Panetta and General Dempsey spent much time explaining the difficulties of military action. Mr. Panetta said intervention could expedite a civil war in the country and make an explosive situation worse. He said bluntly that the Obama administration recognized “that there are limitations of military force, especially with U.S. boots on the ground.” He added that “it doesn’t make sense” for the United States to act alone, without a coalition of allies, as was the case in .Ms. Amos, the United Nations under secretary general and emergency relief coordinator, arrived in Syria for a two-day visit to assess the country’s relief needs. She accompanied a team from the Syrian Arab into the Baba Amr neighborhood of Homs, which had suffered enormous destruction and where activists have reported hundreds of civilian deaths.She made no statement about what she observed, but a spokeswoman at the United Nations, Amanda Pitt, said that Ms. Amos had told her via telephone that the neighborhood was “pretty devastated,” largely devoid of people and punctuated by occasional gunfire.“She wanted to go to Homs and Baba Amr to try and get a sense for herself of the impact of the fighting — and of the lack of humanitarian access —  and to get there as soon as possible,” Ms. Pitt said in an e-mail. She said Foreign Minister Walid al-Moallem of Syria, her host, had told Ms. Amos that she “would be able to go wherever she wanted.”The state-run Syrian Arab News Agency made no mention of Ms. Amos’s visit to Homs, but reported her arrival in Syria earlier on Wednesday and quoted Mr. Moallem as saying that the government was trying to respond to emergency civilian needs “despite the burdens it faces because of the unfair sanctions imposed by some Arab and Western countries on Syria.”Accounts of torture and deprivation in Homs, conveyed by fleeing civilians, have been denounced as enemy propaganda by the government of Mr. Assad, who has belittled the mass demonstrations against him and insisted that his forces have been battling foreign-backed terrorism. While and , his biggest foreign supporters, have defeated attempts by the to condemn Mr. Assad and hold him accountable, fractures have surfaced.On Monday, Russia’s prime minister and president-elect, , reaffirmed his support for Mr. Assad but said he did not know how much longer Mr. Assad’s government would last. On Wednesday, China announced it was withdrawing most of its workers from Syria, reflecting what appeared to be declining confidence in Mr. Assad’s powers of governance.Syria’s deputy oil minister, Abdo Hussameldin, announced his defection on a YouTube video, Reuters reported early Thursday, which would make him first high-ranking civilian official to abandon the Assad government since the uprising began.The authenticity of the video, which was filmed at an undisclosed location, could not be confirmed.“I Abdo Hussameldin, deputy oil and mineral wealth minister in Syria, announce my defection from the regime, resignation from my position and withdrawal from the Baath Party. I join the revolution of this dignified people,” Mr. Hussameldin says in the video, which was uploaded Wednesday and seen early on Thursday.“I say to this regime: you have inflicted on those who you claim are your people a whole year of sorrow and sadness, denying them basic life and humanity and driving Syria to the edge of the abyss,” he says, adding that the country’s economy is “near collapse.”Mr. Assad appointed Mr. Hussameldin, 58, to his position through a presidential decree in 2009.Wearing a suit and tie, Mr. Hussameldin looked relaxed as he stared directly into the camera in a tight head and shoulders shot, appearing to read from a prepared statement on his lap as he sat on a dark gray chair against a yellow background.”I have been in government for 33 years,” he said. “I did not want to end my career serving the crimes of this regime. I have preferred to do what is right although I know that this regime will burn my house and persecute my family.”Public defections have remained rare among the civilian branches of the state, which Mr. Assad’s opponents attribute to the tight control of the secret police and the fear of retribution against families of any would-be defectors.In late August, the attorney general of Hama Province, Mohammad al-Bakkour, declared in a YouTube video that he had resigned in protest against the suppression of street demonstrations and the storming of the city of Hama by tanks, according to Reuters. Mr. Bakkour has not been heard from since and some opposition sources say the video was made under pressure from rebels.'"
"'12-03-08,'1','At 46, Mr. Lazzarini teases Mr. Levai that he’s old enough to be his father. But Mr. Lazzarini also introduces him to people in the art world.“I’m just trying to learn from everyone, so I listen as much as possible,” said Mr. Levai, who only seems innocent in a tough market, although it’s also hard, with his russet hair, soulful brown eyes and pale skin, not to see him as looking like an older Max of “Where the Wild Things Are” who also set out on a hero’s journey of sorts.At his father’s openings as a child, and when he wasn’t busy playing video games, he learned from what the grown-ups were saying about the work of Fernando Botero, Richard Estes, Dale Chihuly, Tom Otterness and other artists represented by Marlborough. His first art memory was a Red Grooms installation (another Marlborough artist) at Grand Central Terminal in 1993.Art runs in the family. Mr. Levai’s great-uncle, Frank Lloyd, was a founder of Marlborough, in London in 1946. Mr. Levai’s father, now 76, met his mother, Rosemary, when she was an assistant to Philippe de Montebello at the Metropolitan Museum in the 1970s. (They are separated.) Looking at art was as regular an activity for father and son as fishing.“When my father took me to museums, I always wanted to rent the recorded-tour headsets,” Mr. Levai said on a recent evening in a spare but imposing office he borrowed from a staff member of his gallery, since he doesn’t have his own. “But he said no because he wanted to talk and he also wanted to hear what I had to say.”Was that a key to raising a son willing to step up so early without the requisite period of rebellion? “My father didn’t push, but we’d go and look at art, and he’d tell me a little, and then we’d talk about other things,” Mr. Levai said. “He never pressured me to join the business, but he was always around for me. I see him as much as a friend as a father.”Even when Dad disapproves of how things are going and son gets in trouble. That’s what happened when he was late with the catalog for his first major group exhibition, “Blind Cut,” a multi-generational survey of international artists held this winter.“He warned me the catalog would take longer than I thought,” he said. But once it materialized, he added, it was so impressive that his father had nothing but praise.“One of the reasons I started here right away is that he’s in his mid-70s,” he said, sitting below a sculpture of a stretched skull by Mr. Lazzarini that seemed to be rushing forward into the future. “There isn’t a lot of time for me to learn how his business runs.”There was sadness in his voice, perhaps at the thought of his father’s mortality.But then, he is without the glibness and buoyancy of the young. Well, as Shakespeare wrote, “Uneasy lies the head that wears a crown.” That was the sentiment of Henry IV, whose cutup son, Hal, eventually bucked up to step up and become Henry V.How does the younger Mr. Levai, who not so long ago was playing basketball for the Browning School, then studying art history at Marymount Manhattan College, escape the responsibility of the insurance, the shipping, the critics and all the curatorial conversations?He goes to Knicks games with his father, hangs out with artists and hits the occasional club, too. Lately he’s been cooking in his East Village apartment for school pals, many who live in Bushwick or Greenpoint, Brooklyn, or with parents. He also smokes. “But only recently in front of my father,” he said while inhaling a Camel Light in front of his gallery on West 25th Street in the dusk. “I guess that means I’m really a grown-up now.”Cigarette finished, he opened the impossibly heavy glass doors to his monumentally modern glass building, where his gallery occupies a couple of floors. Two tiny figures passed though, looking about as big as raccoons. They said hello: the Olsen twins, formidable fashion designers at an early age.'"

"'12-03-09,'1','The Bay Area is known for the Golden Gate Bridge, technology start-ups and California cuisine, among other things. Oil does not usually make the list.But the region’s five oil refineries along San Pablo Bay and the Carquinez Strait were responsible for $7.8 billion in oil exports in 2010, more than any other metro area in the country, according to a report released Thursday by the Brookings Institution.It was up $726 million from the year before.“A lot of U.S. exports are things that we do not see,” said Emilia Istrate, a senior research analyst at Brookings, who helped write the report. “Sometimes people forget how much refined oil there is around,” she said.Government and industry officials said in interviews that the increase in the amount of finished oil exported from the East Bay’s refineries was linked to changing economic and gas consumption patterns in the United States. Other facilities along the West Coast have also seen their exports skyrocket as domestic demand sags.High gas prices, more fuel-efficient cars and fewer commuters have all contributed to California drivers using a million fewer gallons of gas than they did in 2005, according to the California State Board of Equalization, which collects the state gasoline tax.'"
"'12-03-09,'1','But housing is one of the most contentious issues in a city that likes a good fight, and any ideas are sure to face pushback.Since 2002, the city has offered incentives to commercial developers to include units for low-income residents in their projects. But in 2010, it changed its rules to create more leeway for developers to pay fees instead of including the units, and possibly profit more in the hot rental market.Before that change, 75 percent of new construction projects included affordable units. Now the majority of projects receiving permits, 55 percent, opt out, according to a January report by the city’s budget and legislative analyst.More developers have chosen to pay the fee, “rather than construct inclusionary affordable housing,” the report concluded.While those fees do go toward building affordable housing elsewhere, many experts argue that the process is slower than private sector inclusionary projects. Further complicating matters are continuing cuts in federal and state financing to the city for affordable housing, which dropped to $56 million annually in 2011 from $104 million in 2007, a decrease of 46 percent.With urgency mounting, Mayor Edwin M. Lee has created the Housing Trust Fund Working Group, consisting of city officials, developers and community leaders, to find ways to develop affordable housing.But there are many challenges:¶For-profit ventures alone are unlikely to succeed. Because of the recession and tightened lending rules — coupled with higher costs of building in the city (in part due to municipal fees) — private banks are likely to finance only luxury housing for the wealthy, experts said.¶Adding more housing of all types — rentals and private homes — could stabilize prices or drive them down. But a city analysis estimated that it would take 100,000 new units, and only about 2,700 are in development.¶And there is the city’s storied predisposition to oppose any change, or even discuss issues.That view was apparent last month after I wrote a column about what some see as the unintended consequences of the city’s rent control laws: subsidies for the rich, inadequate protections for the poor, and thousands of rental units kept vacant by frustrated landlords.An avalanche of vitriol followed, along with a record number of comments on the Bay Citizen Web site (some longer than the column), revealing long-simmering resentments by tenants weary of high rents and property owners who feel unfairly demonized.Ken Cleaveland, director of government and public affairs for the Building Owners and Managers Association of San Francisco, a commercial real estate group, said the city must move past such divisions with “a combination of private and public means” to address affordable housing.S. Osborn Erickson, chairman of Emerald Fund, a local developer, and a member of the mayor’s housing group, agreed. One example is his company’s project at 333 Harrison Street. Financed partially by a state grant, there will be 326 units, 49 of them affordable housing with rents that could be as little as $600 a month for a one-bedroom apartment.But with such inclusionary grants increasingly rare, Mr. Erickson said other ideas are needed — he is looking up, literally, to the sky.He said taller buildings should be allowed in this notoriously low-rise city as a way to increase housing and influence affordability. In existing commercial stretches, “Why not 80 feet high?” he asked.Tamper with the skyline? To some, that’s as verboten as debating rent control.'"
"'12-03-09,'1','“We started to think about how Web ads can move from being informative and transactional to delighting and engaging, stirring the soul and building a brand,” said Jim Lecinski, vice president for United States sales and service at Google.Project Re:Brief is “an experiment, like how automobile companies build a concept car or clothing companies put on a runway fashion show,” he added. “It’s about what it inspires everyone else to do.”The four campaigns chosen for reworking were all for “iconic brands, brands the industry and creatives look to for inspiration,” Mr. Lecinski said, and “they’re all based on emotive ideas.”The new campaigns, he added, were developed by “a mashup of technologists and big-idea creative people,” who were seeking to produce work that would “showcase our creative possibilities.”The creators of the original campaigns who agreed to participate in the project after being tracked down by Mr. Lecinski and Aman Govil, product marketing manager for Google, are: for Alka-Seltzer, Howie Cohen and Bob Pasqualina, who worked at Wells Rich Greene; for Avis, Paula Green of Doyle Dane Bernbach; for Coca-Cola, Harvey Gabor of McCann Erickson; and for Volvo, Amil Gargano of Carl Ally Inc., later Ally & Gargano.“Taking our classic commercial and totally reimagining it for today, using Google technology and the Internet,” Mr. Cohen said, was “exciting, a little intimidating, challenging and thrilling.” Mr. Cohen, 69, is now partner and chief creative officer of the Phelps Group in Santa Monica, Calif.Mr. Pasqualina, who is 74, said Google found an actor “who looks a little bit like” Milt Moss, who played Ralph in the original campaign. The three were reunited during production of the new campaign.The new ads will give consumers a look at “a day in the life of Ralph” eating the whole thing from breakfast through dinner, said Mr. Pasqualina, who with Mr. Cohen also created the campaign for Alka-Seltzer known as “Try it, you’ll like it.”Google executives plan to share the results of the project with marketers and agencies to stimulate discussion of ways that technology can encourage creativity rather than squelch it. The four marketers will also be offered the work to potentially run if they so choose.“There are assets we’ll be able to use in our own advertising and communications efforts,” said Linda Gangeri, national advertising manager at the Volvo Car Corporation, owned by the Zhejiang Geely Holding Group, in areas like digital and social media. Volvo involved its creative agency, Arnold Worldwide, part of Havas, in the effort, she added.“I’m very familiar with ‘Drive it like you hate it,’ ” said Ms. Gangeri, who has worked for Volvo more than 30 years. She said she already had in mind other campaigns that could be refreshed with new technology, among them one with a safety focus that carried the theme “My daddy loves me so much he bought a Volvo.”Jackie Jantos, global creative director at the Coca-Cola Company, said that she, too, would “love to do it again.”“It’s less about taking content from our past and recontextualizing it and more about finding new and interesting ways to use technology to have more conversations with our fans,” she added.Ms. Jantos praised the updated “Hilltop” as “amazing” because it provided a real-world version of the story of the original commercial “about bringing people together.”“There was a woman in South Africa and a man in Buenos Aires who were able to have a little conversation back and forth,” she added, on a video screen embedded in one of the special vending machines.Because Project Re:Brief is a Google marketing effort, the money to develop and produce the campaigns came from the Google marketing budget and the four marketers did not spend any ad dollars. The cost of the project is estimated to be in the low seven figures.'"
"'12-03-09,'1','Responding to intensifying criticism about the Texas government’s decision to exclude Planned Parenthood from a health care program for low-income women — a move that the federal government considers illegal — Gov. Rick Perry said at a news conference on Thursday that the state would use its own money to operate the program if Washington stops financing it.“This program is not going away,” he said.The Medicaid Women’s Health Program, which serves 130,000 women, receives $35 million in federal financing every year and hands it out to many clinics, including some run by Planned Parenthood.None of the clinics are allowed to perform abortions. But Planned Parenthood provides the procedure elsewhere in the state, and Mr. Perry and Republican lawmakers pushed for a new rule to keep the organization from receiving any of the money that goes to the Women’s Health Program.The Obama administration has said that as of March 14, when the new rule takes effect, the federal government will suspend its financing of the program if Texas persists in excluding a Planned Parenthood. That would shut down the Women’s Health Program, which gets 90 percent of its financing from the federal government.The program, also provides birth control, breast cancer screenings and pap smears.Mr. Perry said Thursday that he would not rescind the rule barring financial assistance to Planned Parenthood. He did not say where he would find the $35 million to keep the program running if the federal support ends, or whether the program would still serve women on Medicaid.'"

"'12-03-09,'1','But the Kurdish activists remain divided, and so are not a full force in the drive to oust Mr. Assad. Like Syria’s Christians, many are deeply suspicious and fear that a new Sunni government will marginalize them even further. In meetings of Syrian opposition leaders, Kurdish representatives have quarreled over which rights, freedoms and powers Kurds would have — or would be denied — in a new Syria.“The Kurds in Syria have their own problems,” said Mahmoud Othman, a Kurdish Iraqi member of Parliament. “They are against the Assad regime. They have been for years. They have no rights. But they are not sure about which people will come after.”Mr. Assad has in part been able to retain support throughout the popular uprising by courting Syria’s minority groups that looked to the police state for protection. Recognizing the potential danger of a unified Kurdish opposition and a chance to exploit their divisions, Mr. Assad offered long-sought citizenship rights to tens of thousands of Kurds and invited Kurdish leaders to the negotiating table.But Abdul Basit Sida, a Kurdish opposition leader, said that the government’s brutal response to dissent was gradually unifying Kurds against Mr. Assad, and that they were ironing out differences with Arab leaders of the opposition.Still, mainstream Kurd opposition leaders have pledged not to fight the Assad government or join rebel fighters, for fear of drawing a lethal response from the security forces. That reluctance could blunt their role, given how the government has deployed tanks, soldiers and pounding force to crush centers of dissent.“We support the Free Syrian Army,” said Kawa Azeri, a Kurdish exile in Iraq and an opposition member, referring to the main armed opposition group. “We have a deal with them and we are coordinating with them, but we are not fighting with them.”But their presence here also highlights another potential ramification of the upheaval and violence in Syria, because as the refugees arrived in northern Iraq, they are discovering they are not the first.In 2004, a riot erupted at a soccer match in the heavily Kurdish city of Qamishli, in northeast Syria, setting off clashes with security officers and days of demonstrations as Kurds vented their rage. Thousands fled the ensuing crackdown and wound up here, in a refugee camp they named Qamishli, to memorialize the violence.Nearly eight years later, their seemingly permanent exile may offer a glimpse of the future for thousands of Syrians who have crossed into Lebanon, Turkey and Jordan, a distressing omen that the emergency along Syria’s borders could persist for months, if not years.“When I first came to Kurdistan, I thought I would stay for a few weeks,” said Barzan Bahram, a leader in the Qamishli camp. “I didn’t expect to live in exile.”The recent influx of Kurdish refugees represents the first real movement of Syrians into Iraq since the uprising against Mr. Assad’s government erupted a year ago. The newest arrivals are young men evading conscription, soldiers deserting the army and civilians and protesters fleeing the spreading instability.Their numbers — 100 to 500 — are a trickle compared with the thousands who have poured into other countries. The United Nations refugee agency said that there was no pressing humanitarian emergency inside Kurdistan, and that the people crossing the border had been finding shelter with residents.But they are living as a people apart.In Iraq, the Kurdish refugees are strangers, welcomed into refugee camps and the homes of family friends and distant relatives, but still living in limbo.They say they hope to return should Mr. Assad’s government fall. They want to begin working to carve out guarantees so that they, like Iraq’s Kurds, could have greater rights and control over their lives. But as opposition fighters retreated from their stronghold of Homs last week, any hopes of a quick return crumbled as the state forces moved aggressively to regain control with heavy weapons, including tanks.Kurdish officials are allowing the Syrian Kurds to stay, welcoming them on humanitarian grounds even as the officials refuse to take sides in a Syrian civil war that has turned into a global power struggle.Iraq’s Kurdish leaders are trying to thread the needle in a bewilderingly complicated clash of political, sectarian and ethnic interests. Iraq’s Sunni Arab minority has channeled money, aid and weapons to the Syrian opposition, but many Shiites worry about new waves of violence if Mr. Assad’s Alawite-dominated government falls to a largely Sunni uprising.Iran, Kurdistan’s powerful and increasingly besieged neighbor, is the Syrian government’s staunchest regional supporter. Turkey, a crucial economic partner for Kurdistan, is rallying behind the opposition. And yet the government of both nations are wary that greater Kurdish autonomy in a post-Assad Syria could stoke separatist movements among their own large Kurdish populations.Syrian Kurds say more control is precisely what they want. To some, self-rule inside Syria could be a critical step toward creating a single independent nation of Kurdistan uniting the diaspora from different countries, a long-term dream that complicates the regional calculus.“We are definitely seeking to obtain what Iraqi Kurds have gained,” said Mr. Azeri, the exiled opposition member. “I think what they have got so far is because of their long-term struggle, mass graves and chemical bombs. This is our minimum right.”Kurdistan’s president, Massoud Barzani, has made several overtures to Syrian Kurdish opposition groups. He invited them to Erbil, the Kurdish capital, and urged them to demand their rights as Kurds. But he has not called for Mr. Assad to step down, despite the rising death toll and broad international condemnation of the Syrian government’s brutal tactics.But under lonely gray skies, the patchwork tents and cinder-block homes of Qamishli feel far removed from those questions. The new arrivals huddle in shadowy living rooms, texting their friends and checking their Facebook pages for updates from inside Syria. They worry about reprisal attacks against their families, and wonder about the shape of their future.“There is no chance to go back now,” said Mohammed Jafo, 26, a Kurdish student at Damascus University who said he fled Syria rather than be conscripted into the army. “We crossed the line.”Two weeks ago, Mr. Jafo said, he paid a smuggler about $850 to take him close to the Iraqi border, and in the dead of night, walked three hours across the border. Iraqi villagers sheltered him for a night, and then took him to the Kurdish security forces, the pesh merga, who questioned him and then brought him to Qamishli.“I need to find a job, I need to find a house,” he said. “I don’t know anyone. This is the problem.”He is staying in the spare bedroom of a long-term exile named Adnan Yousef, who still speaks bitterly of how Syrian officials made him change his true Kurdish name — Shiro — for an Arab one. Mr. Yousef said he had a duty to take in the Kurds now fleeing Syria.“When I came here,” he said, “someone else took care of me.”'"
"'12-03-09,'1','Lawyers for nine of those pardoned — four who had been working as trusties at the Governor’s Mansion and five who are the only ones still in prison — argued that the courts did not have the authority to determine whether procedures were followed correctly. The Constitution not only gave the governor the power to pardon, they said, but also left it solely to the governor to determine whether they were issued properly.“While this court clearly has the constitutional duty to interpret the content of laws passed by the Legislature and executive orders issued by the governor,” wrote Justice Jess H. Dickinson in his majority opinion, “we decline — as have so many other courts before us — to assume for ourselves the absolute power to police the other branches of government in fulfilling their constitutional duties to produce laws and executive orders, unless there is alleged a justifiable violation of a personal right.”In a dissent, Chief Justice William L. Waller Jr. argued that the State Constitution put limits on the governor’s pardon power, and that the court was obligated to make sure those limits were not crossed.“Certainly, no one would argue that a court could investigate and determine the wisdom or propriety of a governor’s acts, including pardons,” he wrote. “However, the constitutionality of a governor’s acts, including pardons, is a question which the court must determine.”Mr. Barbour expressed gratitude toward the court and defended the pardons as “decisions based on repentance, rehabilitation and redemption, leading to forgiveness and the right defined and given by the State Constitution to the governor to offer such people a second chance.”Mr. Hood criticized the decision, saying, “It is truly unfortunate that a majority of the court has stricken from our Constitution a right to notice of a pardon reserved by the people of Mississippi in our 1890 Constitution.” He said he would push for an amendment to Section 124 “to make it very clear that the judicial branch is responsible for enforcing the 30-day notification period.”While the decision applied only to the nine pardons, an opposite ruling would have put the vast majority of the others in jeopardy.The five who are still in prison are beginning the procedures for release, which should happen within the next 48 hours, said a spokeswoman for the Department of Corrections. And the men who worked at the Governor’s Mansion, including four murderers whose pardons attracted the most controversy, now have clean records.Tiffany Brewer, whose sister was killed by one of the men, said she had somewhat expected this decision.

"'12-03-09,'1','THE ’scape has come a long way since the 19th century, when it tended toward purple mountains’ majesty, soul-stirring seas and fields of transcendence, with God or Nature — take your pick — beaming in the background. Our cultural sense of the ’scape expanded throughout the 20th century and continues to evolve: cityscapes and microscapes, starscapes and bodyscapes, dreamscapes and inscapes (as clarified by Jung and Freud) and today’s soundscapes, Webscapes, datascapes and an infinity of futurescapes.The following books include views of New York City as seen through the eyes of a certain web-spinning superhero; “big weather,” as captured by a storm-chasing photographer; and that man-made oasis of Southern California, the swimming pool. As with all the best ’scape artists, just when we think we’re looking at places or things that we think we know, the artist makes us blink — and our eyes are shocked wide awake.When Marvel Comics arrived in the 1960s, one thing that set it apart was that most Marvel heroes worked out of New York (right, the first page of “Spider-Man” No. 69). No metaphorical Metropolis or lame Gotham for the Fantastic Four and the Amazing Spider-Man. Heck, Spidey even grew up in Queens. And one of the many pleasures in this oversize book — each page scanned directly from the original art — is watching the ol’ webslinger zip and zoom through the Manhattan cityscape in the 1960s and ’70s as drawn by Mr. Romita, one of his defining artists. (Available at comics shops or idwpublishing.com.)One purpose of landscape art can be to evoke awe, to make the viewer feel as small as a carpenter ant at a skyscraper construction site. In “Supercell,” with its otherworldly photos of extreme weather, consider that mission accomplished. From Turkey, Tex., to Broken Bow, Okla., from Thunder Butte, S.D., to Moscow, Kan., these stormscapes by Kevin Erskine — the Nebraskan alter ego of the Dutch photographer Erik Hijweege — bear us to the very heart of tornado weather, of storm supercells and motherships, vast clouds from which tornados descend. These hallucinatory sky sculptures (above, “Low Clouds 1, Levelland, Texas, 2007”) give us what the critic John Ruskin called “the truth of the skies.”In Diebenkorn’s Ocean Park Series the abstract is in constant conversation with the figurative. Diebenkorn, who died in 1993, started out as a West Coast abstractionist, then migrated to the realistic. When he moved to Ocean Park, a beachfront neighborhood in Santa Monica, Calif., in 1967, his work eased back toward the abstract (right, “Ocean Park #105,” 1978). These landscapes, suffused by Southern California light, evoke the planes of Cézanne’s world and the colors of Matisse, and reveal the inscapes of Diebenkorn’s final decades.'"
"'12-03-09,'1','In a sign of the tough approach Washington is taking, prosecutors in February indicted Wegelin & Company, the oldest Swiss private bank, on charges that it had helped Americans evade $1.2 billion in taxes. That prompted the bank, founded in 1741, to say it was breaking up, raising fears among the Swiss that Washington might pick off others.The Swiss presidency rotates among the seven members of the country’s executive body, the Federal Council, with a different member serving each year. That makes Ms. Widmer-Schlumpf, 55 and a lawyer by training, “first among equals” on the council and the face of Switzerland in many international settings.“We were very surprised by the Wegelin indictment,” Ms. Widmer-Schlumpf said, “because we understood there to be an implicit agreement that they would not do something like that during the negotiations.”She said the countries had made “considerable progress” toward a global deal in the last few months. An agreement will include deferred prosecution deals against Swiss banks accused of helping American tax evaders, fines and a “substantial” transfer of client data to the Internal Revenue Service, she said.Ms. Widmer-Schlumpf said that Switzerland, which accounts for more than one-quarter of the world’s offshore wealth, was not prepared to abandon banking secrecy altogether and that the data transfer “has to take place within the existing legal procedures in both countries.”“States have rights, and we have to respect that,” she said, expressing hope that a deal would be reached soon. “I think it’s in the interest of both sides to come to a solution now.”Ms. Widmer-Schlumpf spoke after the Swiss Parliament on Monday approved a new double-taxation treaty with the United States, under which American authorities will be able to more easily track suspected tax cheats, even without naming names, by asking for information on particular types of suspicious accounts.Donald S. Beyer Jr., the American ambassador to Switzerland, told Swiss radio this week that it was a “positive and useful step.”Paul L. Behling, a partner at the law firm Withers Bergman in New Haven, said that the Swiss Parliament’s approval “eliminates the legal obstacle to a deal” between the banks and the I.R.S.Switzerland’s banking secrecy law has complicated banks’ efforts to resolve the conflict. Another source of friction is the distinction made by the Swiss, and virtually no one else, between tax fraud, a crime here, and tax evasion, which is not.On the side of the United States, ratification of the double-taxation treaty, signed by the two governments in September 2009, has stalled. Senator Rand Paul, Republican of Kentucky, has balked at the treaty, arguing that it gives the I.R.S. too much power to intrude without grounds for suspicion of financial crimes.Mr. Paul’s office did not respond to requests for comment. The Treasury and State Departments declined to comment.“We have a very good relationship with the U.S.A.,” Ms. Widmer-Schlumpf said, noting, for example, that Switzerland represents American interests in Iran and is one of America’s largest investors.“The problem we have now, you shouldn’t hang the whole relationship on it,” she added. “I believe that’s why we can find a solution to this problem.”Ms. Widmer-Schlumpf said that Switzerland was working to improve its reputation with a “clean-money strategy” announced in February. The strategy is based on three main elements: new international withholding tax agreements with other countries, improved administrative assistance in international tax cases, and a requirement that Swiss banks scrutinize accounts more closely.First, she said, the Swiss have to overcome their past sins, settling with the Americans and other governments and persuading doubters of their sincerity.“Our problem is that we have not been taken seriously,” she said, though for several years “we’ve been doing more than other countries.” That includes efforts to fight money laundering and insider trading, more than 40 double-taxation agreements with other countries, and the adoption of tough capital standards at too-big-to-fail institutions like Credit Suisse and UBS.Ms. Widmer-Schlumpf said the Swiss financial sector — which contributes about 11 percent of the country’s gross domestic product and accounts for about 200,000 jobs in a country of fewer than eight million people — might struggle in the first few years of a more transparent era.“But in the long term,” she said, “we’ll gain clients because of the Swiss quality.”A deal with the United States may not be the model for others, as the United States has a stick — the threat of denying Swiss banks access to its vast markets — that others lack. The Swiss-preferred models are the withholding tax deals reached last year with Britain and Germany, which will ensure that taxes are paid without divulging client data.But those deals have been challenged by the European Commission because, the commission argues, they undermine its efforts to set up deals for automatic information exchange with Switzerland, which does not belong to the European Union. The German Parliament is also threatening to block any bilateral agreement on fairness grounds.In any case, the writing is on the wall for American tax cheats in Switzerland. Some Swiss banks have been warning American clients that they should either prove they are in compliance with American law or have their accounts closed. They are also recommending that any clients not in compliance should hire a lawyer and enter the I.R.S.’s voluntary disclosure program.“I tell my clients if they have an undeclared offshore account that it’s in their best interest to come back into compliance,” said Kevin E. Thorn, a tax lawyer in Washington who has helped people navigate the voluntary disclosure program. In practice, he said, that means paying a penalty, now 27.5 percent of the value of the undeclared account, and bringing their records up to date.“Because if they don’t, and the government opens a criminal investigation, they’re going to pay a lot more,” he said, perhaps 50 percent or more of the undeclared account with the cost of fighting a felony charge of tax evasion to boot.Martin Naville, chief executive of the Swiss-American Chamber of Commerce in Zurich, said the hope for Switzerland was that after a deal was reached, “there will still be some kind of confidentiality or data protection.”“But protection for tax evaders, I think that part is really gone,” he added.Mr. Naville said he was skeptical that a Swiss deal would do much to stop Americans from trying to beat the taxman.“They’ll go to the Channel Islands; they’ll go to Singapore,” he said. “But no Swiss bank will touch them.”'"

Housing wealth decreased by the most in more than a year.Since reaching a five-year low of $50.5 trillion in the first quarter of 2009, net worth has improved by $8 trillion.

"'12-03-09,'1','According to two officials closely involved in the debt negotiations, the participation rate could surpass 90 percent, a level that few would have predicted weeks ago. Greece will still need to impose so-called collective action clauses — provisions that will force the holdouts to accept the offer.But to pull that trigger with a number of 90 percent or better would put Greece in a much better position legally if some investors challenged the swap.“It’s a done deal,” said Hans Humes, the president and chief investment officer of Greylock Capital Management in New York, whose fund is a member of the committee of banks that negotiated the transaction.One remaining wild card in the deal was the 20 billion euros ($26.5 billion) of Greek bonds governed by foreign law, which gives creditors better legal protection than the local-law bonds. The foreign-law securities have attracted the attention of potential holdouts, at least some of which are speculators that bought them at a discount on the open market in hopes of extracting a better deal.Petros Christodoulou, the head of Greece’s debt management agency, has told wavering bondholders that there will be no sweetheart deals for holdouts. “We know what money we have and we know what money we don’t have,” he said during a recent interview. “My blood curdles to think what happens if this deal does not get done.”The Institute of International Finance, the global banking body that has represented private bondholders in the discussion, circulated a confidential memorandum to European leaders recently estimating that a disorderly default by Greece, which could result in the nation’s departure from the 17-nation euro monetary union, could result in losses to banks, corporations and governments of as much as a trillion euros.Although many considered the memo a scare tactic, it nevertheless seemed to have had an effect on some of the potential holdouts. When the alternative was put in such stark terms, many investors evidently concluded it would be better to accept the swap — giving them a package of foreign-law Greek bonds, as well as securities from Europe’s financial rescue fund — than to end up with nearly worthless bonds subject to Greek law.The value of Greek 10-year bonds recently hit a record low of 16 cents on the euro.“This is the best offer they can make to investors,” said Ioannis Sokos, a bond analyst at BNP Paribas. “Because at the end of the day Greece has no cash.”Still, many foreign investors say they believe that even with a successful debt swap, the Greek debt burden will remain untenable — well above the 120 percent of Greece’s gross domestic product that the I.M.F. considers the highest sustainable level. And with the Greek economy still in free fall and the makeup of the next government uncertain, many analysts contend that Athens may have to restructure its debt yet again within a year or so.Against that possibility, some hedge funds and other investors are already talking about the prospect of eventually buying the new foreign-law bonds at rock-bottom prices and then fighting Greece in courts outside the country in hopes of earning a handsome profit.A successful swap deal right now would also leave much of Greece’s debt in the hands of official lenders like the European Central Bank and the I.M.F. Those institutions might ultimately face large losses themselves if Greece cannot find a way to manage its finances without further bailouts.Legal analysts contend that the Greek government’s recent strategy of bluntly emphasizing the cost of not participating in the swap deal has been a significant factor behind its coming together so quickly.“What is remarkable is the speed with which this has been executed — that is unprecedented,” said Michael Waibel, an expert on sovereign debt law at Cambridge. “And this very well may have been done by design.”'"
"'12-03-09,'1','An initial draft of the amendments published last year prompted fears that the police would be given even more powers than they already hold. About 80,000 people responded to the government’s invitation for online comments. The most controversial proposal, called “the disappearance clause” by critics, would have allowed the police to hold suspects for up to six months at secret residential locations without notifying relatives.Human rights activists and legal scholars argue that China’s police use detention in secret residential sites to restrain and silence government critics, a practice they say has grown in the past three or four years as China has clamped down on dissent. The internationally known artist and dissident Ai Weiwei, for instance, was held incommunicado for 43 days last year in a secret location in Beijing before his wife was allowed to visit him.Chen Guangzhong, an adviser to the legislative committee that drafted the amendments, said he and others had argued strenuously that the police should not be given such broad latitude. The issue was debated in a series of sessions that were also attended by representatives of the Ministry of Public Security, China’s main law-enforcement body.“I made it clear that was unacceptable,” said Mr. Chen, a consultant to the Supreme Court and the government’s top prosecutorial authority. “That could mean that someone could be holed up in a place for six months without anybody knowing it.”The revisions would give the police just 24 hours to inform relatives when a suspect is being held at a residential location. “This particular battle has been won,” said Nicholas Bequelin, a senior researcher for Human Rights Watch who is based in Hong Kong. “This is about reformers preventing the police from getting extra powers.”The police would also be required to contact relatives of suspects who are held in detention centers, unless notification would impede an investigation and the suspected crimes involve national security or terrorism. Even then, legal specialists said, the delay would be limited to 37 days.Legal scholars argue that alerting relatives is important because otherwise suspects and defendants are completely isolated in a system stacked heavily against them, with no way to seek legal help.Under the revised law, the police would also be required to record on videotape and audiotape interrogations of suspects who face possible death sentences, life imprisonment or, according to Mr. Chen, prison terms of 10 years or more.A suspect would also be allowed to meet a defense lawyer without permission from the police, except in cases involving national security, terrorism or grave allegations of bribery. Legal aid would be provided to those in economic need before as well as during trial. And for the first time the code would specify that one goal of the criminal justice system would be to “respect and safeguard human rights.”But other important safeguards fell by the wayside. Mr. Chen said he had failed to win approval of a clause that would have guaranteed a suspect’s right to remain silent. As a practical matter, defendants risk longer sentences if they protest their innocence or complain about the police behavior, including the infliction of torture. Nonetheless, about 5 percent of defendants insist their confessions were obtained by torture, a study by Professor McConville found.The revised law would specify that the police must inform a suspect of his or her right to a lawyer when first questioning the suspect. But it is not clear whether suspects who want a lawyer would be granted one during the initial interrogation, which determines the outcome of many cases.Moreover, under China’s Criminal Law, which is a separate statute, defense lawyers would still be subject to prosecution if they presented evidence the prosecution deemed false. Legal experts say the threat of such retaliation poses a serious impediment to any kind of defense.Whether the police and prosecutors will abide by the new strictures is another question entirely.The previous round of reforms, in 1996, did not significantly change “the behavior of all those who are in charge of the system, including police, prosecutors and judges,” said Professor McConville, a law professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. For instance, although reformers said the revisions would make judges more impartial, Mr. McConville’s study found that judges still see themselves as duty-bound to help prosecutors construct and win their cases.In a nutshell, he said, China places a huge amount of trust in the police, prosecutors and judges while giving individuals precious few tools to defend themselves. “The defendant is placed at enormous disadvantage,” he said.Legal reformers prefer that suspects be interrogated and held in formal detention centers rather than isolated at undisclosed residential locations where they might be subjected to more abuse. The latest amendments specify that residential confinement should take place in a suspect’s home, for up to six months, except in cases involving threats to national security, terrorism or extreme cases of bribery. In those cases, suspects can be held at an unspecified residential location other than their home.At a packed news conference late Thursday, Lang Sheng, a criminal law committee expert with the congress’s legislative affairs commission, said that residential confinement is to be used only in limited circumstances to hold suspects who would otherwise be arrested.'"

"'12-03-10,'0','In view of regional differences in health care markets, Mr. Hill said, “we want to give states as much flexibility as possible to choose what works for them.”“We want states to be successful in establishing their own exchanges,” Mr. Hill said. “We are doing everything we can to help states get ready. But we are not naive. There is a likelihood that some states won’t be ready.”Under the rules, each exchange will certify health insurance plans, operate a Web site comparing costs and benefits, and help consumers enroll. In addition, the exchange will determine who is eligible for federal subsidies, available to people with annual incomes up to four times the poverty level (up to $92,000 for a family of four).Federal officials pointed to these examples of flexibility in the rules:¶ A state can choose to run an exchange through an existing state agency or through a nonprofit entity established by the state.¶ A state can open its exchange to all insurers and health plans, or it can limit the number of health plans available to consumers through the exchange.¶ States can decide what role agents and brokers should have in selling insurance through an exchange. Officials assume that agents will play a significant role.¶ States can allow larger employers to participate. In 2014 and 2015, each exchange will be open to companies with either 1 to 50 or 1 to 100 employees. In 2016, all exchanges will be open to businesses with 1 to 100 workers. Starting in 2017, states can let in companies with more than 100 employees.If an employer seeks coverage through an exchange, it can designate one health plan for its employees or it can offer them a choice of two or more plans.Some states, like California, Connecticut and Washington, are racing to set up exchanges. Some, like Florida and Texas, have expressed little interest.The variation was illustrated by events on opposite sides of the country this week. In Oregon, Gov. John Kitzhaber signed a bill, passed with bipartisan support, specifying how the state’s insurance exchange will work.“The exchange will contribute to the success of our larger health care reform effort,” said Mr. Kitzhaber, a Democrat.But the New Hampshire House of Representatives passed a bill that prohibits state and local officials from planning or creating a state insurance exchange. The bill goes now to the State Senate, where some Republicans have expressed support.State Representative Andrew J. Manuse, a Republican, said the bill was “part of a national effort to amend, repeal or replace the federal health care law.”'"

"'12-03-10,'0','The oceans have always served as a sink for carbon dioxide, but the burning of fossil fuels since the beginning of the industrial revolution, especially over the last 40 years, has given them more than they can safely absorb. The result is acidification — a change in the chemical balance that threatens the oceans’ web of life.In earth’s history, there have been many episodes of acidification, mainly from prolonged volcanic eruptions. According to a new research review by paleoceanographers at Columbia University, published in Science, the oceans may be turning acid far faster than at any time in the past 300 million years.Changing something as fundamental as the pH of seawater — a measurement of how acid or alkaline it is — has profound effects. Increased acidity attacks the shells of shellfish and the skeletal foundation of corals, dissolving the calcium carbonate they’re made of. Coral reefs are among the most diverse ecosystems on the planet. Ocean acidification threatens the corals and every other species that makes its living on the reefs.The authors tried to determine which past acidification events offer the best comparison to what is happening now. The closest analogies are catastrophic events, often associated with intense volcanic activity resulting in major extinctions. The difference is that those events covered thousands of years. We have acidified the oceans in a matter of decades, with no signs that we have the political will to slow, much less halt, the process.'"
"'12-03-10,'0','Compact at 5 feet 8 inches and 160 pounds, he straightened his hair and wore a sliver of a mustache. He earned a reputation as a playmaking center, a dipsy-doodler of a stickhandler who liked to put the puck between a defender’s legs and go around him.“While you’re looking down, I’m behind you,” he said.When he and his older brother Ossie started their careers, no blacks played in the N.H.L. Conn Smythe, the Maple Leafs’ owner, watched Carnegie skate and, the story goes, said, “I’ll give $10,000 to anyone who can turn Herb Carnegie white.”The Carnegie brothers heard racist slurs from the stands in the small towns of the Canadian mining leagues.“You learned to play on,” Carnegie said last month in a telephone interview.They graduated to the Quebec Provincial League, a notch or two below the N.H.L., and teamed with Manny McIntyre, a winger/enforcer from New Brunswick. The presence of three black players on the same line was a gate attraction and a headline writer’s dream. They became known as les Noirs, the Black Aces, the Dusky Speedsters.When fans watched them, Carnegie said, “their reaction was, ‘There’s three of them?’ ”They were more than a novelty act, with Carnegie winning multiple Most Valuable Player awards with the Sherbrooke Saints.“When I was 13 or 14, I never missed a game when Sherbrooke was in town,” Jean Beliveau, the Hall of Fame forward, said. “I tried to duplicate what Herbie was doing at faceoffs and making passes onto the blade, not behind the wingman.”In 1946, Kenny Washington and Woody Strode broke the N.F.L.’s color line with the Los Angeles Rams. The next year, after a season with the minor league Montreal Royals, Robinson made his major league debut with the Brooklyn Dodgers.In August 1948, Rangers General Manager Frank Boucher invited Carnegie to the team’s training camp in Saranac Lake, N.Y.“Bring your own skates,” Boucher wrote in a letter, adding, “if possible, have your skates sharpened so that you will not lose any time in getting on the ice.”Carnegie said: “It was a very exciting time for me. I said, ‘This is my opportunity.’ ”During the first week of camp, he said, the Rangers offered a contract with their minor league club in Tacoma, Wash. He turned it down. A day later, he received an offer to play for their team in St. Paul. He declined. Then came a third offer: to report to New Haven of the American Hockey League, just below the N.H.L.Carnegie was 28, with a wife, three children and a fourth on the way. He could not afford to take a pay cut.“It was hard for me to demean myself to take a pee-wee salary when I was worth a senior salary,” he said.Carnegie believed that he had earned a spot on the Rangers.“I was as good as the most talented player,” he said. “I was stopped by the color barrier.”He never got another opportunity.“I think Herbie made a mistake,” said the hockey historian Stan Fischler, who saw Carnegie play during his prime. “He should have gone to the minors like Jackie Robinson and proven how good he was.”Cecil Harris, the author of “Breaking the Ice: The Black Experience in Professional Hockey,” wrote that Carnegie would be remembered as “the best black player never to reach the N.H.L.” Harris referred to him as “the Josh Gibson of hockey,” a reference to the star Negro leagues catcher who never got to play in the majors.Three months after his tryout, Carnegie led his Sherbrooke squad to Madison Square Garden to play the Rovers, another Rangers farm team. He scored a goal in a 4-2 victory.Any satisfaction was short-lived. The Black Aces split up, and Carnegie could only watch as teammates and opponents advanced to the N.H.L. He said he had bouts of rage.Carnegie retired in the mid-1950s after a stint with the Quebec Aces of the Quebec Hockey League; Beliveau, now 80, was a teammate.In 1958, the N.H.L. became the last of the four major professional sports leagues to integrate when Boston signed Willie O’Ree.By then, Carnegie had started the Future Aces Hockey School, one of the first hockey academies in Canada. He devised the Future Aces Creed, a 12-point philosophy that empowers youths to become responsible, caring citizens.Working with young players allowed him to confront, and soothe, the bitterness inside him. Carnegie stayed active, winning several senior golf tournaments, until his sight failed him. He was a successful financial planner and was married for more than 60 years. His wife, Audrey, died in 2003.In addition to Bernice Carnegie, his survivors include two other daughters, Goldie and Rochelle, and a son, Dale.Carnegie had one final unrealized dream: to be inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame, in his hometown. The 18-member selection committee denied Carnegie the honor in the player and builder categories.“Without question,” Carnegie said, he should be in the Hall. A 2001 documentary, “Too Colourful for the League,” made his case, with testimony from Richard Lord, who broke collegiate hockey’s color barrier at Michigan State.“Herbie deserves to be in the Hall of Fame,” Fischler said. “He was a pioneer. But he has to have a rabbi, a good one, with the selection committee, and no one has stepped up.”'"
"'12-03-10,'0','I was delighted to read Paul Krugman’s March 5 column, because he identified a problem, the “states of depression” at the state and local levels, that has received too little attention.Living in California, I have had the sad opportunity of watching as a minority of Republicans in this deep blue state have been able to put a stranglehold on the state’s finances by a rigid adherence to the Grover Norquist anti-tax pledge, thanks to a required supermajority for tax measures.With the state in fiscal free fall, the effect has been felt at every level of government, not only because these levels have their own problems but because the state can no longer offer other jurisdictions the subsidies that it had been able to provide in the past.A good example of the problem in the no-longer Golden State is the fate of the redevelopment process, which the state ended in 2011, thereby striking a death blow to some 400 redevelopment agencies statewide. By means of this process and under state law, cities had been able to renew infrastructure and promote economic development.Now all bets are off about how cities will be able to proceed in the future.

"'12-03-10,'0','LONDON — Norman St. John-Stevas, a Conservative politician who coupled a dandified manner with keen intellectual and aesthetic sensibilities, and who presented a ready target for Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher when she began culling left-leaning Tory dissidents from her cabinet in the early 1980s, died on March 2 at his home here. He was 82.His death followed a short illness, his family said.Known in later life as Lord St. John of Fawsley, after his political downfall was cushioned with a seat in the House of Lords, he was both a protégé and a victim of the woman he called, with a strongly irreverent inflection, “the Blessed Margaret.”His first government post, as junior minister in 1972, made him an aide to Mrs. Thatcher, then the education minister in Prime Minister Edward Heath’s cabinet. After usurping Mr. Heath as Conservative leader and forming her own government in 1979, she appointed Mr. St. John-Stevas leader of the Commons with a seat in the cabinet, responsible for managing the government’s parliamentary agenda.But the exuberance that had appealed to the new prime minister in her years of political insurgency became irksome when her government ran into choppy political waters with its hard-line economic policies. Mr. St. John-Stevas aligned himself with the “wets,” the group in the cabinet that took a skeptical view of her policies.Cabinet members recalled Mr. St. John-Stevas as he sat at the end of the cabinet table, drawing laughter from other dissenters with stage whispers aimed at an increasingly unamused prime minister, often invoking his nicknames for her, including “the leaderene” and, most irritating for Mrs. Thatcher, Tina, coined from her political battle cry at the time, “There is no alternative!” She also suspected him of feeding cabinet gossip to an always eager press.One anecdote he liked to tell was of the time he asked to be excused from a meeting at 10 Downing Street because he had a reception to attend. “But I’m going to the same function,” Mrs. Thatcher said. “Yes,” he replied, “but it takes me so much longer to change.”'"
"'12-03-10,'0','Even so, a case can be made that Lehman fared much better than could have been expected for either G.M. or Chrysler. Within days of Lehman’s collapse, Barclays stepped in and bought its core investment banking unit. That gave Lehman the cash to keep managing the remaining assets, and it subsequently was able to borrow what is known as debtor-in-possession financing to keep operating through the Chapter 11 process. Barclays kept about 10,000 Lehman Brothers employees.None of those options were available to G.M. or Chrysler. Months into the financial crisis, rapidly running out of cash, the auto companies couldn’t find anyone interested in buying their assets. Even if they could, no banks were in a position to lend to would-be acquirers, nor would they provide the financing needed to keep the automakers operating during the Chapter 11 process. When G.M. filed for bankruptcy in June 2009, a Federal District Court ruled that the Treasury was the only potential source for the $15 billion in DIP financing G.M. needed to continue operating. The court also oversaw and approved G.M.’s emergence from bankruptcy, contrary to Mr. Gingrich’s contention that G.M.’s reorganization was a “violation” of bankruptcy law.I spoke this week to Harvey R. Miller, a partner at Weil, Gotschal & Manges in New York and a prominent bankruptcy expert who advised both Lehman and G.M. The idea that General Motors or Chrysler could have survived a Chapter 11 filing without government support “was very unlikely,” he told me. “Without the debtor-in-possession financing, they would have had to shut down,” he said. “The court ruled there was no possibility for DIP financing except from the government. The Republican candidates are ignoring this. I’ve watched the debates. The misstatements are so shocking.” (Mr. Miller said he wasn’t identified with either political party.)Besides the fact that no one would provide the financing to keep the companies running, Mr. Miller said, “every survey ended with the conclusion that few, if any, people would buy a vehicle from a company that was in Chapter 11,” unless there were some guarantee. “A car or truck is the second-largest investment an American family makes after the purchase of a home,” he said. “Buyers factor in what will happen to the warranty, maintenance and the resale value. They were going to be very reluctant to buy a car from a company whose future was in serious doubt.” Even with government backing, rivals used G.M.’s brief 43 days in Chapter 11 — a far shorter period than Lehman’s — to try to grab market share.Mr. Miller said that an analogy to the kind of Chapter 11 bankruptcy Mr. Romney has called for, one unassisted by taxpayer money, might come from Braniff Airways, which filed for bankruptcy in 1982. Passengers were already shunning the airline as rumors of bankruptcy circulated. Once it filed, much of its fleet was grounded. It soon ran out of the cash needed to keep operating in bankruptcy. The airline was liquidated.It’s hard to measure what would have been the consequences if G.M. and Chrysler had been forced to liquidate. But we know that policymakers seriously underestimated the unforeseen reactions and dire results of Lehman’s bankruptcy filing. Rescuing Lehman wouldn’t have addressed the deeper causes of the crisis, like the housing and mortgage bubbles. Still, it might have prevented the near panic that ensued. It’s hard to find anyone today who argues that letting Lehman Brothers fail was actually a good thing, although Mr. Santorum and Mr. Gingrich have both said they wouldn’t have bailed it out. Mr. Miller says he believes the consequences of a G.M. and Chrysler failure would have been potentially catastrophic.“It was clear in December of 2008, if G.M. and Chrysler went under, the effects would course through the entire automotive supply business,” he said. “Dana and Delphi had already failed. Many others were on the brink. The estimate we saw was that in excess of 500,000 jobs would be lost. Michigan, Indiana, Ohio and Illinois would have been devastated. It was a compelling factual situation. President Bush took a look at this and said, ‘I can’t let this happen on my watch.’ ”Even though Mr. Bush is an avowed free-market champion, he approved emergency loans of $17.4 billion to G.M. and Chrysler, financed by the same Troubled Asset Relief Program legislation that rescued the banks, which gave the automakers enough cash to operate until the Obama administration could fashion a longer-term plan. The Republican candidates have repudiated Mr. Bush’s action in the name of ideological consistency, “but sometimes circumstances get in the way of philosophy,” he told a national convention of auto dealers last month. “I would make the same decision again.""However healthy the American auto industry is today, the idea of government bailouts and continued ownership of private companies remain anathema to a large swath of the American public, an audience the Republican candidates are surely aware of. Last month a Gallup poll asked, “Do you approve of the auto bailout?” A majority, 51 percent, said no; 44 percent said yes. Among Republicans, 73 percent said they disapproved of it.'"
"'12-03-10,'0','The would-be agent impressed them with his passion, and when Mason was selected with the 17th pick of the first round of the 2000 draft by the Seattle SuperSonics, Montgomery was on the map.By the time Lin came to his attention in 2009, Montgomery had departed from Momentum and struck out on his own. N.B.A. clients had come and gone during that time — Mason, for example, retired in 2009 — leaving Montgomery relying largely on his longest-tenured player, the Washington Wizards’ Maurice Evans, who had gone undrafted in 2001 before willing himself into a nine-year career.Going it alone was not easy; Montgomery, who is married with three children, confessed to doubts along the way. But he kept at it, taking notes, constantly looking for players he might realistically be able to reach out to. And on Dec. 6, 2009, when Lin, a senior at Harvard, put up 30 points in a near-upset of 13th-ranked Connecticut, Montgomery was quick to respond.“Right away, I liked his game,” he said. “I thought, ‘I’ve got to get him.’ ” Lin was an ideal candidate for the Montgomery Sports Group — a player with a big ceiling and a small likelihood of attracting larger agencies, who are not likely to dwell on Ivy Leaguers.“Often, I don’t bother going after top prospects,” said Montgomery, who until recently was his firm’s lone full-time employee, with an office in suburban San Antonio. “I aim for guys who are similar to me: they haven’t been given much in their careers and they’re supermotivated to prove themselves.”For Montgomery, the overtures to Lin began with an introductory package of material sent to Harvard Coach Tommy Amaker, who passed it along to Lin’s family. Telephone interviews gave way to Skype talks; Montgomery even asked Evans to get on the phone to provide a candid take on life in the Montgomery Sports Group family.“Roger told me this was a special player,” Evans said, “and said, ‘Be honest with him.’ ” Montgomery then met Lin for the first time in April 2010 at the Portsmouth Invitational in Virginia, an annual gathering of N.B.A. prospects. Soon after, he received a commitment from Lin.It is an agent’s job to be ambitious, bordering on delusional. Leading up to the 2010 draft, Montgomery was holding out hope that Lin might sneak into the first round. The worst-case scenario, he figured, was that the Knicks, who needed a point guard not named Chris Duhon, would select him with one of their two second-round picks.“After his private predraft workout, Jeremy said Coach D’Antoni called him into his office and told him he saw some Steve Nash-type qualities in him,” Montgomery said of Knicks Coach Mike D’Antoni. “We thought he was a perfect fit for the system.”But on draft night, as he sat at home in San Antonio texting with Lin, Montgomery watched the Knicks use those second-round picks on Landry Fields, a shooting guard, and the since-jettisoned guard Andy Rautins.“I was devastated,” Montgomery said. “There were sleepless nights. When you’re a boutique agency, you have to get it right.”Indeed, for agents with only one or two clients — with income derived from fees of up to 4 percent they receive on player contracts and up to 20 percent on endorsement deals — it is a continual struggle to prove credibility to recruits and avoid having clients poached by larger firms. Boutique agents have to compensate for a lack of visibility and clout with resourcefulness, attentiveness and savvy scouting.“I focus on under-the-radar guys, and I learn everything about them — talent, character, work ethic,” said Mike Naiditch, an agent based in Chicago who represents the Boston Celtics’ Greg Stiemsma and Lin’s Knicks teammate Bill Walker, who is sidelined with an elbow injury.But the problem when dealing with the overlooked is that that type of player may never get a chance to wake up. Like many boutique agents, Naiditch trades in bubble players, guys fighting for spots on the bench rather than in the starting five.Which was exactly the position that Lin found himself in after being passed over in the draft. To boost his stock, he headed to Las Vegas for the N.B.A. summer league and earned notice while playing for the Dallas Mavericks’ squad. That led to a two-year deal that Montgomery negotiated with Golden State.Warriors General Manager Larry Riley said Montgomery “did right by Jeremy” by insisting on some guaranteed money in the deal rather than settling for a “make-good contract” without such money, an arrangement other teams might have offered.Still, the Bay Area marriage did not last. Lin played sparingly during the 2010-11 season and was waived on the first day of training camp after the lockout. The Houston Rockets picked up his contract, but cut him 12 days later, on Christmas Eve. The Knicks called the next day.The rookie Iman Shumpert had strained his knee in their season opener on Christmas and the team needed a replacement who could run the point if needed.“When I saw the 212 on my phone,” Montgomery said, “I thought: Here we go. Let’s see what happens.”Montgomery has not looked at his February phone bill yet. No need. He knows it is “off the charts.” Linsanity had a slower start than many people remember — Lin saw limited action with the Knicks for more than a month before he suddenly started taking over games — but once it took hold, Lin became one of the more marketable figures in the United States, and beyond.That left Montgomery and his new team — he has hired two full-time staff members, one to work on marketing and player relations, the other to be an administrative assistant — with the enviable task of sifting through the pitches cascading their way. They are taking their time, talking to Nike about a revised deal for Lin, trying to fend off unsolicited advice. And withstanding the criticism from those who think Montgomery is doing Lin a disservice by not getting his name on several dotted lines right now.“I’ve been hearing that we should strike while the iron is hot, as though Jeremy’s a one-hit wonder,” Montgomery said. “People don’t know what we should do, but they’re on TV pretending they do.”So he is blocking it out, even as Linsanity has quieted down for now as the Knicks and Lin have found it harder to sustain their initial run.Montgomery has two businesses to build— his client’s and his own — and that does not leave much time for engaging talking heads or reading any of Lin’s press clippings or even wondering what is ailing the Knicks at the moment. Back in the pharmacy, Montgomery did not buy that copy of People, or even flip through it. There was not much point. “It’s not as interesting to read a story,” he says, “when you’re living it.”'"

"'12-03-11,'0','First, the global backdrop: Factors tightening supplies include harsh weather in Europe, a cutback in exports from producers like Syria, Yemen and South Sudan, growing demand from India and China, and, increasingly, international measures imposed on Iran. Because of concern about Iran’s nuclear program, the United States is restricting bank transactions with Tehran, the European Union has set an embargo on Iranian oil for July 1 and many international insurers have stopped covering tanker pickups of Iranian oil.The insurance cutoff is already having an effect, said Morten Arntzen , the nonexecutive chairman of Tankers International, a consortium of supertankers based in London. Tankers International is “not going to Iran any longer,” he said. (Mr. Arntzen is also chief executive of the Overseas Shipholding Group, the largest United States tanker operator, which, he said, has not taken part in the Iran trade as a company since 2002.)The possibility that Iran might block shipping in the Strait of Hormuz has added a risk premium to oil futures markets, which are regionally bifurcated, said Robbert Van Batenburg, head of equity research at Louis Capital Markets. The price for Brent crude, widely viewed as the global benchmark for oil, was about $126 a barrel on Friday, far higher than for West Texas Intermediate, often called the American benchmark, which was about $107.The gap has been widening. North American oil “is trading at a discount to world prices, because it is landlocked and can’t easily be transported to world markets” — or to refiners in the Northeast or the West Coast, said Andrew J. Black , president of the Association of Oil Pipe Lines. And East Coast gasoline prices reflect the higher Brent crude price, said Tom Kloza, chief oil analyst for the private Oil Price Information Service.Crude oil production has increased sharply in Canada and in the central United States in recent years — including initial production from the Bakken Shale, an oil-rich deposit in North Dakota. This has created what the White House calls a bottleneck in Cushing, Okla., the midcontinent storage hub.Pipelines connect Cushing to ports and refineries in the gulf, but they flow in only one direction at a time, and were originally designed to move imported oil north from the gulf into the Midwest, Mr. Morse said. In a laborious process, the flow of some pipelines is being reversed and a new one — the southern part of the Keystone XL pipeline — is being built to ease the glut. (The pipeline’s owner has reapplied for permission to build a northern portion, which would run from Alberta, Canada, to Cushing, after President Obama said that more extensive environmental reviews were needed.)In the short term, if prices spike further in a geopolitical crisis, the government could release oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, a series of storage sites on the gulf in Louisiana and Texas established in the wake of the 1973 oil shock. But Mr. Morse said that moving oil through the north-south pipelines connected to the reserve no longer made sense because of the glut to the north. “It’s not needed there,” he said.Moving reserve oil by tanker from the gulf could run into another series of problems. The 1920 Jones Act requires purely domestic cargo to move on ships built in the United States, carrying the American flag and using American crews. Large tankers meeting these requirements are in service on the Alaska-California route, but few are available for additional shipping, according to government reports.To release oil from the reserve quickly during the Libya crisis last year, the government waived provisions of the Jones Act. Some labor and industry groups oppose a repeat performance.“In a time of high unemployment in the United States, ignoring the Jones Act, which has been central to American national security and protects American jobs, just makes no sense,” said Dan Duncan, secretary-treasurer of the maritime trades department of the A.F.L.-C.I.O.And Thomas A. Allegretti, president of the American Waterways Operators, which represents tug and barge operators, says that there are plenty of small to midsize vessels available that are Jones Act-compliant. “Our barges are transporting a great deal of petroleum products already,” he said. “We have a fleet that is ready and able.”But even if there were enough American-flagged ships to move substantial amounts of additional oil, the price of shipping from the gulf to the Northeast or the West Coast is prohibitive, several industry executives said, because American-flagged vessels charge much higher rates than foreign-flagged ones.That helps explain why gasoline in the Northeast is so expensive. “If we could get that cheaper American oil in our Northeast refineries, we would have been using it,” said Thomas Golembeski, a spokesman for Sunoco, which is closing its refineries in the region. Those operations are unprofitable, he says, partly because Sunoco must import more expensive oil from Europe and Africa.Prices may ultimately decline nationwide. But as Northeast refineries close, the federal Energy Information Administration says, prices for refined petroleum products in the region are likely to rise compared with the rest of the country. That should be true even when differences in local taxes are taken into account.Eventually, market forces will bring the Northeast’s prices down some, the agency says, but infrastructure and shipping constraints are likely to preserve regional disparities.Meanwhile, if you are a consumer in a less-favored region, be prepared for more unpleasant price comparisons.'"
"'12-03-11,'0','Peyton Manning is a free man. Drew Brees is not.A week after a record 21 players were given franchise tags — only Brees, the Saints’ star quarterback, got an exclusive tag and cannot talk to other teams — the N.F.L.’s free-agency period begins. And it will be crazy.For teams willing to part with two first-round draft picks, game-changers like Ray Rice, Wes Welker and Matt Forte are available. For those looking to spend only money to acquire new talent, the Saints starters Marques Colston and the All-Pro guard Carl Nicks are on the market. So is the highly regarded quarterback Matt Flynn, who does not seem to have much future in Green Bay behind Aaron Rodgers.And for teams ready to gamble, there is Manning, a four-time most valuable player.“I have no idea who wants me, what team wants me, how this process works,” Manning said after being released by the Indianapolis Colts, who are rebuilding, uncertain about his health after four neck operations and have a $28 million roster bonus remaining in their bank account by cutting Manning.“I mean, this is all so new to me,” Manning said.Manning can even sign before free agency opens Tuesday because he was released. Already, cornerback Stanford Routt signed a new deal, joining Kansas City for a three-year, $19.6 million contract soon after he was cut by Oakland.This could be the wildest free-agency period in years. Coming off the 2010 season that had no salary cap and different free-agent rules, then the lockout and a condensed bidding war, the marketplace is crowded. Many of those available figure to be backups: quarterbacks Chad Henne and Rex Grossman, running back Ronnie Brown and defensive back Pacman Jones, for example.'"
"'12-03-11,'0','And, last week, it emerged that News Corporation, which is controlled by Rupert Murdoch and has been trying to contain the damage from a long-running phone-hacking scandal in Britain, is the subject of an F.B.I. inquiry into possible bribery there and in Russia. A spokesman for the News Corporation, Jack Horner, declined to comment.Until recently, federal prosecutors had won settlements in nearly every battle involving charges of foreign bribery by multinational corporations and their executives. But in late February — indeed, the very week that Mr. Stanley was sentenced — the Justice Department had an embarrassing setback: it abruptly withdrew the biggest case ever brought against individuals under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.It was an extraordinary turn of events. The F.B.I. had recorded 800 hours of video and audio as part of a sting operation involving supposed arms contracts in Africa. Twenty-two executives had been arrested.Then the whole case fell apart. In a withering appraisal, the federal judge in the case, Richard J. Leon, called the government’s effort “a long and sad chapter in the annals of white-collar criminal enforcement.” Its approach to the law, Judge Leon said, had been “very, very aggressive.”THE development opened the door for critics who assert that federal authorities have overstepped in trying to fight corruption overseas. They say that the crackdown, which began in earnest three years ago, has made it harder for companies to win legitimate business and that it has needlessly instilled fear among executives. Many companies would rather make any charges brought under the act go away with a quick settlement than try to fight them in court.“We are seeing companies getting scooped up in aggressive enforcement actions and investigations,” said Lisa A. Rickard, president of the United States Chamber of Commerce’s Institute for Legal Reform, which is pushing to modify the law. “A culture of overzealousness has grabbed the Justice Department.”“The last time I checked,” Ms. Rickard added, “we were not living in a police state.”Such heated criticism aside, federal authorities say they are unbowed.Lanny A. Breuer, the assistant United States attorney general who has stepped up enforcement actions under the act, said he saw no reason to change course. In fact, he is expanding his staff — and his range of potential targets.“We have to be willing to take cases that we would be willing to lose,” Mr. Breuer said in an interview. “We can’t just pick the easy cases.”Even more, he sees himself on the right side of history, especially given the outcry against government corruption in the Arab world and elsewhere.“This is not the time for the United States to be condoning corruption,” Mr. Breuer said. “We are a world leader and we want to do everything to make sure that business is less corrupt, not more.”Enacted in 1977, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act prohibits American companies and foreign companies whose securities are traded on exchanges here from bribing foreign officials to attract or keep business. For many years, there were few prosecutions under the act. In 2003, for instance, not a single person was charged.But in the last four years, a total of 58 companies have paid a combined $3.74 billion to settle such corruption charges. Since 2009, some 67 people have been charged, 20 are still awaiting trial or are at large, and 42 have been convicted, some from charges prior to 2009. A total of 22 have been acquitted or had charges dismissed.One big fish the government has targeted is the son of the president of Equatorial Guinea, a tiny West African nation. The authorities say the man, Teodoro Nguema Obiang Mangue, amassed over $100 million in the United States through corruption and money laundering while earning an annual government salary of under $100,000. The United States government filed a civil forfeiture complaint last October and is seeking to recover a $38.5 million Gulfstream V, a $30 million oceanfront home in Malibu, Calif., $1.8 million worth of Michael Jackson memorabilia and a 2011 Ferrari valued at more than $530,000. Calls to Mr. Obiang’s lawyer were not returned last week.AS they pursue their overall campaign, federal authorities have their work cut out for them. As business has gone global, so has graft, particularly as companies in rich nations push into poorer regions. The World Bank estimates that $1 trillion in bribes is paid annually to government officials. In Africa alone, $148 billion is siphoned off annually, according to Transparency International, a global nonprofit group that tracks corruption.Jeffrey M. Kaplan, a lawyer in Princeton, N.J., who specializes in cases brought under the corruption act, said: “You are talking about millions of dollars going to dictators who are selling their national patrimony in countries where you cannot even get clean water. Bribery is endemic to the human condition. If it cannot be rooted out, then you need to do something, and the F.C.P.A. is that.”The law does not stop at American shores. Of the 10 largest corporate settlements, nine have involved companies outside the United States. One of the biggest cases involved Siemens, the German engineering company, which was accused in 2008 of bribing officials in a number of countries where it did business. Siemens paid $800 million to federal regulators here and another $800 million to German regulators to settle the case.But a criminal case continues against eight former Siemens executives and contractors, who were charged last December. The eight, none of whom are American, have been accused of paying $100 million in bribes to Argentine officials, including the former President Carlos Menem, to get business for Siemens, whose securities are traded in the United States.According to American authorities, a scheme began in the late 1990s, when the Siemens executives sought a $1 billion contract to make national identity cards for Argentine citizens. The authorities contend that after Siemens paid $16 million to President Menem and more to other Argentine officials, the government cooled on the project. Even after President Menem left office, the American complaint said, former members of his administration demanded payment and members of the incoming administration of President Fernando de la Rúa demanded bribes, too.Mr. Menem has denied any wrongdoing, and Mr. de la Rúa could not be reached for comment.The complaint said Argentine officials later threatened to expose the payments and, in the words of one defendant it quoted, demanded still more money “to prevent potential physical harm” to Siemens employees in Argentina. The complaint said bribes continued to flow until 2007, when the payments were finally uncovered.Since then, Siemens has “been compliant with every anticorruption law around the world,” said Peter Y. Solmssen, general counsel for Siemens. “Our experience shows it pays off to pay attention to these issues.”The defendants live in Germany, Switzerland or Argentina and have not been arrested or extradited. Among them was Uriel Sharef, a former Siemens board member; attempts to reach his lawyer in Germany were unsuccessful.In the United States, however, the battle between the Justice Department and its critics is heating up. One big complaint is that corporations would settle allegations rather than face the bad publicity of a trial. As a result, these critics say, the big settlements held up by the Justice Department represent hollow victories.What’s more, some individuals are fighting back — and winning. Citing prosecutorial misconduct, a federal judge in Los Angeles in December tossed out a conviction involving two American businessmen who were accused of paying bribes in Mexico. In January, a federal judge in Texas, citing lack of evidence, threw out a corruption case against an American businessman working for a Swiss company.To critics, such events show weakness in some of Washington’s efforts.“This is a facade of F.C.P.A. enforcement,” said Mike Koehler, an assistant professor of business law at Butler University in Indianapolis, who writes the FCPA Professor blog. “When you have cases in which the corporate defendant settles with neither admitting nor denying, that isn’t a success. It is just a cost-benefit analysis.”Matthew T. Reinhard, a white-collar defense lawyer in Washington, said that most corporations would prefer to settle because the potential losses are big if they lose in court. “For corporations, if you lose, the way the law is written, the financial penalties can be catastrophic,” he said.Mr. Breuer at the Justice Department counters that other white-collar cases often result in settlements, as well. “I don’t buy it,” he said of the criticism. “You could make the same argument for every other area of white-collar cases.”Leading the efforts to modernize the corruption act — or weaken it, in the eyes of the government — is the Chamber of Commerce. The group, in Washington, has been in discussions with the Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission about new guidelines on enforcement. That guidance, expected later this spring, would give corporations a better notion of what they need to do to stay on the right side of the law.Corporate America clearly wants its views heard.“You are dealing with criminal liability, and that strikes fear and terror through the heart of the corporate suite,” said Ms. Rickard at the chamber.In a letter signed by more than 30 trade associations, the chamber asks that the guidance allow companies with strong compliance programs to use that as a defense against liability. It also asks that the definition of a “foreign official” be more limited and that companies not be held accountable for the past wrongdoing of foreign companies they may purchase, among other provisions.Siding with the chamber is a range of business interests, including the American Gaming Association, the American Insurance Association, the Poultry Federation, TechAmerica, the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers Association and the National Association of Manufacturers. The chamber has also lined up the firepower of Michael B. Mukasey, a former attorney general who has been pushing for changes to the corruption act in speeches and testimony before Congress.Mr. Breuer and other government lawyers have spoken out against the provisions. They have been joined by 33 human rights groups, including Amnesty International, Oxfam America and Transparency International.AND yet business interests aren’t the only ones pushing back. People with the financial means are fighting, too. One closely watched case in legal circles is that of Frederic Bourke, co-founder of Dooney & Bourke, the luxury handbag company. He is appealing a 2009 conviction a in a bribery conspiracy case and has vowed to go all the way to the Supreme Court.As Mr. Bourke was about to enter prison last December, he got word that his appeal would be heard. He hardly seemed like a person who would end up facing jail time. His first wife was the great-granddaughter of Henry Ford, he owns homes in Aspen, Colo., Greenwich, Conn., and Maine, and he made a fortune in the handbag business.Mr. Bourke has said he simply fell in with a bad crowd. His former business partner is Viktor Kozeny, the fugitive financier known as the Pirate of Prague over accusations involving financial dealings in his native Czech Republic. Though charged, Mr. Kozeny has avoided extradition by remaining in the Bahamas. Mr. Bourke’s conviction came over his role in a scheme to bribe officials in Azerbaijan over an oil investment.At Mr. Bourke’s trial, tales came out of lavish trips and million-dollar shopping sprees in New York and London paid for by the investment partnership that Mr. Bourke was involved in — the Oily Rock Group — for Azerbaijan officials and their families, some of which were arranged by Mr. Bourke. There was also testimony about plane flights with millions of dollars stuffed into suitcases and dealings with the Chechen underworld.In his defense, Mr. Bourke said he had made no money from the scheme. In fact, he said, he actually lost $8 million. His appeal will turn on whether he was duped or simply turned a blind eye to the apparent corruption around him. He has hired a defense lawyer, Michael E. Tigar, who represented Terry Nichols in the Oklahoma City bombing case.At the Justice Department, Mr. Breuer, speaking in general terms and not about the Bourke case, sounded as if he was up for any fight. The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, he said, often ensnares the wealthy.“Some of the people we accuse are fabulously rich,” Mr. Breuer said. “And they are often fabulously powerful people who can get fabulous lawyers.”'"

"'12-03-11,'0','One work that John Leland’s review of “Eminent Outlaws,” by Christopher Bram (Feb. 26), and apparently the book itself, fail to mention is “A Separate Peace,” by John Knowles. Although there is no explicit sex between the novel’s two main characters (or indeed, between any of the characters), this book, widely assigned in secondary schools and some colleges, can easily be read today as a coming-out story. But it was not seen as such, except by those in the know, when it was first published in 1959.John Leland’s review implies that novels published as early as 1948 “showed teenagers in the hinterlands that they were not alone and pushed discussions of homosexuality onto national television and into the mainstream press.”In the early 1950s I was one of those potentially gay teenagers, growing up in northern New York. Homosexuality was never discussed then in my presence except in epithets and dire references. I read The Times on Sundays and watched television but never learned of explicitly gay characters in any novels. There were no respected public homosexual role models. At Yale in the late 1950s, I learned only of two, both dead: Gide and Whitman. In my three philosophy courses, Plato’s attraction to young men was never mentioned.Had those alleged “national” and “mainstream” discussions happened in the 1950s, I would have noticed.The Times welcomes letters from readers.

"'12-03-11,'0','Stella McCartney was born with a platinum spoon in her mouth and is under no pressure to do anything at all. Yet she has worked hard to become quite accomplished in her own right. Hard to find fault with that. It’s a tribute to both her and Sir Paul.Those shoes. Why do women feel as if they have to teeter around on 4-, 5- or 6-inch heels? Stella is a fashion mogul, a person in power. Could you imagine a man giving up his power by having to focus on walking in shoes like that? It’s the 21st-century version of Chinese foot binding.“I always say there’s this kind of hidden ghetto side to Stella.” Say what? Stella McCartney sounds lovely. Gwyneth Paltrow? Not so much. I’m rather surprised to learn that they’re such good friends and that Gwyneth Paltrow is an expert on all things “ghetto.”It’s clear from this story that Scott Ritter has problems. Big problems. He’s a pervert who has earned his stint in jail. . . . Still, it’s interesting to contemplate part of his point here: that no prominent figures who argued for the war in Iraq have suffered for the disaster they visited upon this country. Rick Santorum, a big and unrepentant Iraq war hawk, a senator who voted for the war, is a leading candidate for the G.O.P. nomination. Mitt Romney likes every position on the Iraq war and has among his elite national security advisers two men — Eliot Cohen and Robert Kagan — who were leading Iraq war proponents among the policy elite. The fact that Iraq isn’t even an issue in the G.O.P. primary race tells you that the American public, or at least G.O.P. voters, aren’t interested in learning any lessons from the Iraq debacle.I saw Scott Ritter as one of the few real heroes in the public sphere for speaking out against the Bush administration’s ginned-up Iraq invasion and subsequent war. He put everything at risk to keep challenging the W.M.D. story line, to avoid war and promote democracy. Unfortunately, he has not been able to combat his personal demons. And like Bill Clinton and Eliot Spitzer, he somehow misses that his personal acts aren’t done in isolation — those closest to him, those who love him, also pay.'"

"'12-03-12,'1','Last week General Dempsey and Defense Secretary said the military was only in the earliest stages of considering the possibilities. Modern commanders in chief have routinely asked for military contingency plans during crises overseas.Senator of and some of his fellow Republicans continue to argue that the United States has a responsibility to involve itself in the Syrian rebellion. “How many more have to die?” Mr. McCain demanded in a Senate hearing last week, referring to what the estimates are 7,500 people killed in less than a year in Syria.Senator , Republican of , said in an interview that the United States had far more strategic interest in Syria than it did in Libya and that the risks of military action could be worth it. “We can’t do every war where you never lose an aircraft,” he said.Mr. McCain, a retired Navy pilot who was shot down and captured during the Vietnam War and who ran against Mr. Obama for president in 2008, has particularly angered military planners for what they see as his emotional and cavalier comments about getting into another war. The planners say they also need more direction from senior officials in Washington on the administration’s goals and desired end-state in Syria.“We’ve been sucked into this open-ended arrangement before, and we’re not going there again,” a senior military official said, speaking of Libya, which required extensive American air power — as well as hundreds of missiles fired from American ships and submarines — to take out Libya’s air defenses so that European warplanes could operate freely. Even then, the United States continued to supply ammunition and refueling planes and fly combat missions.Defense and intelligence officials say that Syria’s integrated air defenses — a combination of thousands of surface-to-air missiles, radars and antiaircraft guns — are not only more advanced than those in Libya, they are also arrayed in densely populated areas on the country’s western border, meaning that even with precision bombing, civilians nearby would probably be killed.“There would be some severe collateral damage going after those areas,” Mr. Panetta said last week.As in Libya, the early stages of an air campaign over Syria would be almost entirely American because of the United States’ arsenal and electronic warfare capabilities and would probably take, General Dempsey said, “an extended period of time and a great number of aircraft.”Once the United States had air dominance, it would be possible to create either safe havens or a “humanitarian corridor” — a secure exit route for refugees to, say, — but military officials say the corridor and havens would be vulnerable to attack by what American intelligence officials say is a formidable, 330,000-troop Syrian Army.“I don’t know how long they would tolerate those safe havens,” Senator , Democrat of and a former Army Ranger, said in a Senate hearing last week. “But second, given safe havens, it would also I think imply that someone would have to go in and organize training and organize, literally, an army. That could take months if not years.”Military officials say that the opposition does not have control of any one area in Syria, unlike in Libya, where, General Dempsey said, “we had tribal forces in the east and west collapsing on the center.” In Syria, he said, “there’s no geographic density of population to collapse anywhere; they’re all intermingled.”Military and intelligence officials say that the opposition to Mr. Assad remains splintered, made up of as many as 100 groups, and that so far no clear leaders have emerged. American officials are considering providing the opposition with an array of technical assistance, potentially including communications equipment, but have yet to be successful in bringing the disparate groups together into a cohesive council.A major concern of the Pentagon is Iran, Syria’s most important ally. Military and intelligence officials say that Iran has recently flown into Syria small arms, chiefly rocket-propelled grenades, as well as technological equipment and high-ranking experts to assist the Assad government in interrupting social media communications and the internet.“They’re providing listening capability, eavesdropping capability to try and pick up where the opposition networks are at, and they’re providing experts who I can only say are experts in oppressing,” Gen. , the head of the American military’s Central Command, said in a Senate hearing last week.At the same time, Russia is a leading arms supplier to Syria and maintains a naval station at the Syrian port city of Tartus, on the Mediterranean coast, its only military installation outside the former Soviet territories. has pushed hard in recent weeks to preserve its relationship with Mr. Assad, most notably vetoing, along with , a resolution calling on Mr. Assad to resign.“If we jump in with purely military instruments as the U.S., absent a broader strategy, we could very quickly hasten reactions from others, namely Iran and Russia, to bolster the regime and start us down a road towards greater confrontation,” Michèle A. Flournoy, a former top Pentagon official, said in Washington last week.Administration officials say that they remain concerned about Syria’s chemical and biological weapons, believed to be among the largest stockpiles in the world, and that they are in discussions with allies in the region about how to secure them.“I’m not saying it’s a fait accompli that if they’re left unsecured, automatically someone can grab them and use them,” General Mattis said. “They may end up frying themselves. But I think that it’s going to take an international effort when Assad falls, and he will fall, in order to secure these weapons.”In the meantime, the Obama administration continues to review all military options in Syria. “Could it be done?” said Lt. Gen. David A. Deptula, who retired last year as the ’s top intelligence official, speaking of a potential American air campaign in Syria. “The answer is yes. But it would not be a cakewalk.”'"

"'12-03-12,'1','So has officially defaulted on its debt to private lenders. It was an “orderly” default, negotiated rather than simply announced, which I guess is a good thing. Still, the story is far from over. Even with this debt relief, Greece — like other European nations forced to impose austerity in a depressed economy — seems doomed to many more years of suffering.And that’s a tale that needs telling. For the past two years, the Greek story has, as one recent paper on economic policy put it, been “interpreted as a parable of the risks of fiscal profligacy.” Not a day goes by without some politician or pundit intoning, with the air of a man conveying great wisdom, that we must slash government spending right away or find ourselves turning into Greece, Greece I tell you.Just to take one recent example, when , the governor of , delivered the Republican reply to the , he insisted that “we’re only a short distance behind Greece, and other European countries now facing economic catastrophe.” By the way, apparently nobody told him that Spain had low government debt and a budget surplus on the eve of the crisis; it’s in trouble thanks to private-sector, not public-sector, excess.But what Greek experience actually shows is that while running deficits in good times can get you in trouble — which is indeed the story for Greece, although not for Spain — trying to eliminate deficits once you’re already in trouble is a recipe for .These days, austerity-induced depressions are visible all around ’s periphery. Greece is the worst case, with unemployment soaring to 20 percent even as public services, including health care, collapse. But , which has done everything the austerity crowd wanted, is in terrible shape too, with unemployment near 15 percent and real G.D.P. down by double digits. and Spain are in similarly dire straits.And austerity in a slump doesn’t just inflict vast suffering. There is growing evidence that it is self-defeating even in purely fiscal terms, as the combination of falling revenues due to a depressed economy and worsened long-term prospects actually reduces market confidence and makes the future debt burden harder to handle. You have to wonder how countries that are systematically denying a future to their young people — youth unemployment in Ireland, which used to be lower than in the , is now almost 30 percent, while it’s near 50 percent in Greece — are supposed to achieve enough growth to service their debt.'"
"'12-03-12,'1','There is usually a ceremony at the start of the next season as fans and players look on with pride as a mysterious figure in the catwalk — usually a facility worker — removes a drape, and the banner signifying a championship is revealed. The crowd roars.It is not simply window dressing.Murray State was an obscure college to Donte Poole when he arrived for a recruiting visit. Poole understood the Racers were successful, but he did not know how successful until he walked into CFSB Center and saw college basketball’s version of a crown: the Ohio Valley Conference championships and the N.C.A.A tournament banners.“When I walked in and saw how many there were I just said, ‘Wow, they really win here,’ ” said Poole, a senior forward. “You want to play at a place where they have had success; it makes a difference. I know when I used to host recruits, I would make sure I pointed out all of our banners.”Poole added: “I’m from Vegas, and I go to U.N.L.V. games. They have some banners, but they don’t have as many as Murray State.”Few universities have as many banners as Kansas does. There are 65 banners at Allen Fieldhouse for everything from retired jerseys to conference titles to national titles to academic all-Americans. Jim Marchiony, the associate athletic director for communications at Kansas, said the banners added to the pageantry of a home game.“Our fans expect to see the banners up there, and the significance of them for the program is not lost on us,” Marchiony said. “It’s part of the history and fabric of the building.”The banners can cause great joy, and they can cause heartache. The two Final Four banners Michigan raised during the Fab 5 era (1992 and 1993) have been taken down because of N.C.A.A. violations. Jalen Rose, the former Wolverines star, has criticized the university for the decision.Memphis had to remove its Final Four banner from the 2007-8 season because of an N.C.A.A. violation. The university also forfeited $615,000 in tournament money and erased 38 wins from its record book, but Coach Josh Pastner said Memphis fans watched the university’s greatest team for five months and would not forget.“It is not a lasting sting because the fans here had a lot of fun with that team, and that season was more than a banner for these fans,” said Pastner, who was not on the staff at the time. “You can erase the wins, but you can’t erase the memory. It happened; 18,000 season-ticket holders don’t need to be reminded by a banner.”But, as the Memphis coach, Pastner understands the significance of the banners. “You coach under them and see what was built here, even before I was born, and it adds some pressure,” he said.New England Flag & Banner, which opened in 1892, has hand-stitched banners for about 1,800 colleges and universities. The Watertown, Mass., company made a name for itself as the Boston Celtics made a name for themselves in the 1950s and ’60s with 11 N.B.A. titles. Red Auerbach, the team’s coach and general manager, ordered one championship banner after another for Boston Garden.The most basic banner, which high schools and smaller colleges often order, is a 3-foot-by-5-foot single-sided banner that can cost $200. A 5-by-8-foot single-sided banner can cost $400. The large double-sided banners that universities typically order for a national championship can cost $2,000.“We have two constituencies: the athletic director, who wants to highlight a program’s success, and the former players at schools who are devoted to the institution,” said Ned Flynn, the owner of New England Flag & Banner. “They buy tickets, they bring their kids, they’re really involved as boosters, and they like to point up and say, ‘There’s my championship.’ ”If a team does earn a banner this month and it is sewn by New England Flag & Banner, the university will receive a little something extra. Sewn in behind the label with the last stitch from the seamstress will be a 2012 penny, buffed and shiny. Flynn said it is meant as a good-luck charm for the program as it pursues more commemoration for its hard work.'"

"'12-03-13,'1','Washington, DC – The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) today announced that Goldman Sachs Execution & Clearing, L.P. (GSEC), a registered futures commission merchant based in New York, N.Y., agreed to pay a $5.5 million civil monetary penalty and $1.5 million in disgorgement to settle CFTC charges that it failed to diligently supervise accounts that it carried from about May 2007 to December 2009. The CFTC order also requires GSEC to cease and desist from violating CFTC regulations requiring diligent supervision. Additionally, the order states that GSEC represented in its settlement offer that it has made changes in light of the events discussed in the order, including implementing enhanced supervision policies, procedures, and training.GSEC provided back-office and other services to some clients who themselves are broker-dealers, according to the order. One such broker-dealer (Broker-Dealer) offered memberships to investors to trade commodities in subaccounts of the Broker-Dealer carried by GSEC, the order finds. GSEC failed to diligently supervise the handling of these subaccounts when it did not investigate signs of questionable conduct by the Broker-Dealer, according to the order. For example, in May 2007, at the beginning of GSEC’s relationship with the Broker-Dealer, the Broker-Dealer’s lawyer represented that the Broker-Dealer would not engage in commodity futures trading and therefore would not need to register as a commodity pool operator with the CFTC. However, the order further finds that the Broker-Dealer had already opened a commodity futures trading account with GSEC and, thereafter, traded commodity futures. Nevertheless, GSEC did not investigate the apparent contradiction between the lawyer’s representations and the Broker-Dealer’s actions, the order finds.The order states, as another example, that in August 2009, GSEC learned that the Broker-Dealer distributed to at least one of its members a subaccount statement that falsely purported to have been issued by a non-existent GSEC affiliate. In addition to noting that no such GSEC affiliate existed, GSEC told the Broker-Dealer that the statement created an inaccurate picture of the Broker-Dealer’s overall performance. Yet, as the order further finds, despite these signals of questionable conduct, GSEC simply instructed the Broker-Dealer not to issue such an account statement and accepted the Broker-Dealer’s assurances that it had not done so before and would not do so again. In December 2009, the Broker-Dealer provided to GSEC a draft disclosure statement that disclosed that the Broker-Dealer had carried negative capital balances of approximately $6.8 million since October 2009, according to the order.From May 2007 to December 2009, GSEC received approximately $1.5 million of gross fees and commissions for transactions it executed and/or cleared on behalf of the Broker-Dealer, the order finds.According to CFTC Division of Enforcement Director David Meister: “The CFTC’s rules mandate that registrants diligently supervise their employees and agents. When registrants become aware of questionable activity, they must not simply rely on assurances from interested parties and their representatives, but instead must diligently investigate. As this case indicates, the Commission will hold registrants accountable if they fail in this regard.”The CFTC appreciates the assistance of the National Futures Association, the Chicago Board Options Exchange, and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.CFTC staff members responsible for this case are Laura Martin, Janine Gargiulo, Candice Aloisi, Judith Slowly, David Acevedo, Manal Sultan, Lenel Hickson, Lisa Hazel, Annette Vitale, Ronald Carletta, Stephen Obie, and Vincent McGonagle.'"

First circulated last week, the 36-page report by Ahmed Shaheed, a former foreign minister from Maldives, found what he called evidence of a “striking pattern of violations of fundamental human rights guaranteed under international law,” offering numerous examples of illegal detentions and maltreatment of prisoners, dissidents, minorities and women. The report, commissioned after Iran’s crackdown on the political opposition following the disputed 2009 presidential election, also criticized Iran for its large number of executions. Iran’s own High Council for Human Rights said the report “amounted to nothing more than the repetition of a barrage of unsubstantiated and biased contentions.”'"
"'12-03-13,'1','Airbus and Europe’s biggest airlines on Monday called on the European Union to find a compromise on aviation carbon curbs, warning that Europe’s emission limits on foreign carriers could lead to retaliation.Airbus, the world’s biggest maker of civil aircraft, and eight airlines including Air France-KLM, Lufthansa and British Airways urged European leaders to “use their influence” and push for a global agreement to tackle emissions from the industry and avoid an escalating trade conflict, according to a letter sent to the prime ministers of France, Germany, Spain and Britain.“The situation is becoming intolerable for the European aviation industry,” according to the letter. “We have always believed that only a global solution would be adequate to resolve the problem of global aviation emissions.”At stake is the first expansion of the European Union’s emissions trading system beyond European borders. The bloc, which wants to lead the global fight against climate change, decided in 2008 that aviation should become a part of the emissions trading system this year after airline carbon dioxide discharges in the region doubled over two decades and international organizations failed to enact pollution curbs.The emission curbs on flights to and from European airports are opposed by the United States, China, Russia and other countries, which said Europe should let the United Nations’ International Civil Aviation Organization decide on greenhouse-gas limits for the industry.Russia is considering limits on European flights over Siberia, Russia’s deputy transportation minister, Valery Okulov, said after the meeting on Feb. 22.'"
"'12-03-13,'1','A Chinese official said that China would have no comment on the issue until the Commerce Ministry’s regular monthly news conference, scheduled for Thursday in Beijing.But the state-run news agency, Xinhua, carried a commentary asserting: “The U.S. decision to bring a lawsuit against China over its rare earth export quotas is likely to hurt bilateral trade ties and trigger a backlash from China instead of settling the rift.”The commentary said China had imposed limits on its rare earth industry so as to protect the environment, including moves to tighten environmental restrictions on rare earth processors. But the commentary did not mention that these limits also include export restrictions that have pushed prices for the 17 rare earths in markets outside China up to several times the level of prices inside China, giving companies an incentive to move factories to China.“These rare earth export restrictions are not about the environment, they are about favoring Chinese industry over global industry,” the European official said.In another sign of the economic and strategic importance of rare earths, the case represents the first time that Japan has started a formal trade case against China at the since the creation of the agency in 1995, although Japan has played a supporting role in a dozen cases filed by other countries against China.Japan had been reluctant until now to bring any trade cases against China, where memories of atrocities by Japanese soldiers still rankle. Japan decided to proceed with the case after China halted shipments of rare earths to Japan for two months in the fall of 2010 during a dispute over contested islands in the East China Sea.Rare earths are vital to various sophisticated technologies, including smartphones, smart bombs, large and . Tungsten and molybdenum are used to strengthen steel and other industrial materials. China is the world’s dominant producer of rare earths, tungsten and molybdenum, and it has imposed increasingly stringent export taxes and quotas on them for the past two years despite having promised the W.T.O. when it joined in 2001 that it would remove export taxes and quotas on all goods except for a handful of other products.“If China would simply let the market work on its own, we’d have no objections,” President Obama said Tuesday. “But their policies currently are preventing that from happening, and they go against the very rules that China agreed to follow” when it joined the W.T.O. in 2001.The minerals trade case and the other trade issues are likely to meet Chinese resistance, particularly as senior officials in are jockeying for position ahead of a Communist Party conclave this autumn that is expected to choose a slate of leaders for the country for the next five years or more.Compounding the trade tensions is the prospect of revived frictions over China’s currency policies.After rising fairly consistently against for nearly two years, helping quiet Western criticism that Beijing has kept artificially low, the currency has begun to weaken again, making Chinese exports more competitive on the global market. On Monday, the Chinese currency fell further against the dollar, after China’s central bank lowered its daily target for the currency. It has now fallen 0.5 percent against the dollar so far this year, after rising 4.7 percent last year.For the last month, American and European officials had mostly deferred action on trade tensions with China.The United States, seeking a good start with Mr. Xi, who is expected to become China’s top leader next winter, postponed acting on the solar panel trade dispute until March to avoid colliding with the Chinese official’s visit to the White House in February.But China is seldom popular during election years in the United States, and this year is no exception. and Congressional Democrats and labor unions have little in common politically — except that they have all called for tough trade policies toward China. It would be politically difficult for the White House to ignore the outcry.The European Union, for its part, has also been fairly quiet in the last month about Chinese trade policies, as it lobbied for a public commitment of Chinese money to ease the . But that sense of crisis has cooled somewhat, now that has succeeded in reaching a debt reduction deal with its private creditors.And senior European Union officials have concluded that even if Beijing does decide to lend money toward a European bailout after two years of resistance, it would not be enough to make a significant difference, according to a person with a detailed knowledge of European deliberations on the issue who was not authorized to comment publicly.A World Trade Organization appeals panel ruled in late January that China must eliminate its export taxes on nine widely used industrial materials, not including rare earths or tungsten. The panel strongly criticized China’s export quota system, saying the policies favored Chinese domestic manufacturers over their global competitors that also need the same raw supplies.The panel did leave open the possibility that the separate system of quotas could be reformed instead of being scrapped entirely. Chinese trade officials are to join the W.T.O.’s monthly dispute-settlement meeting for all member nations in Geneva on March 23 to discuss the matter.Chinese commerce ministry officials have already told Chinese state-controlled media that they do not plan to change their rare earth policies in light of the W.T.O. appeals panel decision.In the United States and Europe, lawmakers, unions and businesses have been chafing at what has seemed to them like Western delay in addressing the rare earth issue. The other four trade issues now also likely to move to center stage are these:AUTO PARTS About 150 members of the House and Senate are preparing to send a letter to President Obama this week asking him to investigate whether China has violated American trade laws by helping its auto parts manufacturers become big suppliers to the United States market. The president is expected to refer the letter to the new interagency trade enforcement task force he announced in January during his .CARS After promising late last year not to discriminate against foreign products in government procurement, China unexpectedly released this month a draft list of automobiles that government officials may buy. All of the more than 140 models are Chinese brands, with no foreign nameplates — even though most foreign brands are now made in China, including the Audis and Buicks popular with Chinese officials.Federal procurement practices in the  United States allow the purchase of foreign brands, including imports as well as foreign brands produced in the United States, although critics contend that American government agencies tend to show an informal preference for brands anyway.SOLAR PANELS The is scheduled to release on March 20 an initial decision on whether China has illegally subsidized solar panel shipments to the United States. The department is widely expected to impose retroactive tariffs on the Chinese products.ANTI-SUBSIDY CASES Congress has just passed, and President Obama planned to sign Tuesday in the Rose Garden, a law that would retroactively revise some American trade laws to 2006. The move would help American companies and labor unions bring anti-subsidy cases against companies in nonmarket economies like China.Quick action on trade, though, can sometimes create new problems. In mid-December, a federal appeals court in Washington ruled that off-road tires from China could not be subjected to the anti-subsidy taxes the Commerce Department had tried to impose. The court said Congress had never explicitly stated that nonmarket economies like China’s could be accused of giving preferential subsidies to local manufacturers.Congress has quickly responded by passing a law that awaits President Obama’s signature, making such cases retroactive to 2006 — the year that the Commerce Department began letting anti-subsidy cases be filed against China.Andrew Schroth, a trade lawyer in the Hong Kong office of Grunfeld, Desiderio, Lebowitz, Silverman & Klestadt who sometimes represents the Chinese commerce ministry in trade cases, said that the United States could be violating its World Trade Organization commitments by making such a legislative change without first consulting China.“The U.S. is trying to change the rules on them,” he said.The Obama administration is already seeking a rehearing of the December appeals court decision. The administration wants to argue that Congress has always implicitly allowed anti-subsidy cases against nonmarket economies — a stance that would be harder for China to challenge at the trade organization.'"
"'12-03-13,'1','Through its invaluable First Music program, the New York Youth Symphony has commissioned works from more than 100 emerging composers since 1984. The orchestra’s concert on Sunday afternoon at Carnegie Hall brought the premiere of “That Blue Repair,” a kind of mini-concerto by Chris Rogerson.Born in 1988, Mr. Rogerson is just a couple of years older than many of the players, who executed the gleaming piece with confidence, and Jay Campbell, an adventurous cellist and an undergraduate at the Juilliard School, who performed the solo part with subtle power and rich tone.The 10-minute work begins with glistening high strings eventually countered by a gloomy undercurrent. The brooding and glimmering alternate, subsiding into a low rumble as the soloist starts a lyrical line upward. The orchestra surges sympathetically underneath him.There are inspired, well-devised touches throughout. As Mr. Campbell went higher and higher up the fingerboard, his line was suddenly taken over by the winds at the same pitch. Mr. Rogerson has a gift for transitions, for moving us from moment to moment, section to section, while maintaining the coherence of the whole.The soloist re-enters, more impassioned this time, with a burst of faster, spikier passagework, before receding again, accompanied by beautiful bell-like riffs in the harp. The weakest part of the work follows, a murky section of standard post-Romantic dissonant waves under the quivering solo cello. It feels a little like film music.'"
"'12-03-13,'1','The sublime and the ridiculous can coexist in disconcerting proximity. Witness Alexei Ratmansky’s 2007 production for the Bolshoi Ballet of the 19th-century ballet “Le Corsaire,” which on Sunday was broadcast live to cinemas worldwide (including in Manhattan). Actually “Le Corsaire” (“The Pirate”) in any modern production is often ridiculous. Only in Mr. Ratmansky’s version does it touch on the sublime — and more so in this broadcast than when I saw this staging live in 2007 in the relatively cramped conditions of the London Coliseum.This ballet, first staged in 1856 in Paris, has become a triumph of textual corruption. By the time Marius Petipa and his successors had finished revising it in Russia at the end of the czarist era, it had a patchwork score by at least seven composers; and the last 90 years have seen its text drastically revised and reordered. It’s a different ballet in each modern production; and no version comes remotely close to the tragic melodrama of Byron’s original “Corsair” poem.What would Byron have made of the “Jardin Animé” scene that is a bizarre but extraordinary highlight of the ballet? The work’s heroine, Medora, is incarcerated in an eastern Mediterranean harem (Christian audiences in the 19th-century loved the titillation of Muslim seraglios) and reigns as ballerina amid this “Animated Garden” in which flower beds, flower baskets, garlands and single blooms are all part of a vast spectacle led by adults (female) and children (male). I stopped counting after 44 women and 12 boys. Its adagio is set to the sweetly fragrant melody of Léo Delibes’s “Naila” waltz (which recurs in Balanchine’s ballet “La Source”).On Sunday this extravaganza, allowed to breathe spaciously on the vast Bolshoi stage and partly shown from above to show the patterning, brought out the work’s most breathtaking moment: femininity as horticulture, an idea that should be offensive to a modern mind enlightened by feminism but ravishing here nonetheless. Which is not to say the whole scene is without absurdity or even longueurs; but images from it stay powerfully with you. The adagio’s climactic image is really of one vast, tiered tableau: small movements pass along the rows as if in the breeze.By the time you reach the “Jardin Animé,” you have already surrendered all hope of coherent sense in “Le Corsaire.” In this version the heroine Medora mainly sports a tutu so wide it looks as if she could spread a picnic on it. In her scene in the corsairs’ cavern lair, however, she nonetheless models two other outfits. The Muslim characters are less appreciatively treated than in, say, Mozart’s “Abduction From the Seraglio.” “Le Corsaire” comes awkwardly close to mocking Muslim prayers toward Mecca.The constant star of these Bolshoi broadcasts is the host, the company’s press spokeswoman Katya Novikova, who manages to be charming, attractive and extremely ballet knowledgeable in Russian, French and English, passing on just enough helpful information and conducting interviews with grace. Camerawork is generally admirable, though in the final scene we should be given a fuller view of the ship before it’s wrecked.'"
"'12-03-13,'1','Eating red meat is associated with a sharply increased risk of death from cancer and heart disease, according to a new study, and the more of it you eat, the greater the risk.The analysis, published online Monday in Archives of Internal Medicine, used data from two studies that involved 121,342 men and women who filled out questionnaires about health and diet from 1980 through 2006. There were 23,926 deaths in the group, including 5,910 from cardiovascular disease and 9,464 from cancer.People who ate more red meat were less physically active and more likely to smoke and had a higher body mass index, researchers found. Still, after controlling for those and other variables, they found that each daily increase of three ounces of red meat was associated with a 12 percent greater risk of dying over all, including a 16 percent greater risk of cardiovascular death and a 10 percent greater risk of cancer death.The increased risks linked to processed meat, like bacon, were even greater: 20 percent over all, 21 percent for cardiovascular disease and 16 percent for cancer.If people in the study had eaten half as much meat, the researchers estimated, deaths in the group would have declined 9.3 percent in men and 7.6 percent in women.Previous studies have linked red meat consumption and mortality, but the new results suggest a surprisingly strong link.'"
"'12-03-13,'1','A new analysis has found evidence that circumcision may reduce the risk for prostate cancer.Researchers studied 1,754 men with prostate cancer and 1,654 controls in King County, Wash. They asked the men if they were circumcised and if they had ever had a sexually transmitted infection. The investigators also gathered information on prostate cancer from a tumor registry.The study, published Monday in the journal Cancer, controlled for age, race, family history of prostate cancer and other factors. The scientists found that circumcision before first sexual intercourse was associated with a 15 percent lower risk for prostate cancer.There is evidence for the role of germs in the development of several cancers — cervical, liver and stomach cancer among them. And there is good evidence that circumcision can reduce rates of sexually transmitted diseases. Sexually transmitted germs have been found in the prostate, including chlamydia, H.I.V., and HPV.Although the exact mechanism remains unknown, the authors suggest that circumcision eliminates the possibility of germs flourishing in the moist environment under the foreskin, and reduces the chance for infection.“These are observational data that don’t prove causality,” said the lead author, Dr. Jonathan L. Wright, an assistant professor of medicine at the University of Washington. “But there is some role for inflammation in several cancers, and this helps bolster that argument.”'"
"'12-03-13,'1','Higher amounts of vitamin D in the diet are associated with a lower risk for bone fractures in teenage girls, a new study has found.Researchers studied stress fractures — the kind that occur with repeated rather than sudden stress to a bone — in 6,712 girls ages 9 to 15 over a seven-year period. Almost 4 percent developed stress fractures, and 90 percent of those who did participated in at least an hour a day of high-impact physical activity, like basketball, running or volleyball.Using diet questionnaires, the researchers calculated the girls’ intake of calcium, vitamin D and dairy foods. Accounting for menarche, body mass index, maternal history of low bone density and other factors, the investigators found that the girls in the group with the highest 20 percent of vitamin D intake were 52 percent less likely to have a stress fracture than those in the group with the lowest 20 percent. Consumption of calcium and dairy foods had no effect.“We can’t say conclusively that intake of vitamin D is going to prevent stress fractures,” said the study’s lead author, Kendrin R. Sonneville, a research scientist at Children’s Hospital Boston. “This is an observational study only. But it can’t hurt, and it might help, to take the recommended or higher doses of vitamin D.”The study was published on March 5 online in Archives of Pediatrics & Adolescent Medicine.'"
"'12-03-13,'1','Rainer Ohler, the head of public affairs at Airbus, said on Monday that Boeing’s Dreamliner, a lighter-weight passenger plane that has outsold Airbus’s midsize models, “is now to be called the ‘Subsidy-liner.’ ”But Ron Kirk, the United States trade representative, said that, from the various rulings, “It is now clear that European subsidies to Airbus are far larger — by multiples — and more distortive than anything that the United States does for Boeing.”European supporters of Airbus had focused much of their complaint on research contracts that Boeing received from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and the Pentagon since the late 1970s to develop lightweight carbon composite materials that the manufacturer subsequently used in the design of the Dreamliner. As much as 50 percent of the 787’s primary structure, including the fuselage and wings, is made of composite materials, more than any other large civil aircraft.United States officials said $2.6 billion of the subsidies that the panel found were from NASA. The appellate body also found that tax breaks that Boeing received from states like Washington and Kansas represented improper subsidies.Boeing has said that about $2 billion in government export subsidies has already been eliminated, though they were included in the W.T.O.’s reports.The W.T.O. has no enforcement mechanism, and both sides pointed to different aspects of the ruling in their efforts to seek more negotiating leverage.In one change that favored Europe, the appellate body added $476 million in subsidies in Kansas to the tally, which had previously focused on those from Washington State. European officials complained that the state and local subsidies continued while the case was under investigation.But Robert T. Novick, a lawyer for Boeing, said the appeals judges also lowered the W.T.O.’s assessment of the harm that the American subsidies had caused Airbus in terms of lost plane sales.One major goal for Boeing and American officials has been to try to prevent Airbus from receiving similar low-interest loans to complete its A350 XWB, which will be similar to Boeing’s Dreamliner.The United States has asked the W.T.O. to form a compliance panel to determine if changes that Europe plans to make will eliminate the subsidies attributed to it. If the European Union plan is found lacking, the United States might consider $7 billion to $10 billion in retaliatory measures, American officials have said.'"

"'12-03-14,'1','When the history books are written about Goldman Sachs, they may reflect that the current chief executive officer, , and the president, Gary D. Cohn, lost hold of the firm’s culture on their watch. I truly believe that this decline in the firm’s moral fiber represents the single most serious threat to its long-run survival.Over the course of my career I have had the privilege of advising two of the largest hedge funds on the planet, five of the largest asset managers in the , and three of the most prominent in the and . My clients have a total asset base of more than a trillion dollars. I have always taken a lot of pride in advising my clients to do what I believe is right for them, even if it means less money for the firm. This view is becoming increasingly unpopular at Goldman Sachs. Another sign that it was time to leave.How did we get here? The firm changed the way it thought about leadership. Leadership used to be about ideas, setting an example and doing the right thing. Today, if you make enough money for the firm (and are not currently an ax murderer) you will be promoted into a position of influence.What are three quick ways to become a leader? a) Execute on the firm’s “axes,” which is Goldman-speak for persuading your clients to invest in the or other products that we are trying to get rid of because they are not seen as having a lot of potential profit. b) “Hunt Elephants.” In English: get your clients — some of whom are sophisticated, and some of whom aren’t — to trade whatever will bring the biggest profit to Goldman. Call me old-fashioned, but I don’t like selling my clients a product that is wrong for them. c) Find yourself sitting in a seat where your job is to trade any illiquid, opaque product with a three-letter acronym.Today, many of these leaders display a Goldman Sachs culture quotient of exactly zero percent. I attend derivatives sales meetings where not one single minute is spent asking questions about how we can help clients. It’s purely about how we can make the most possible money off of them. If you were an alien from Mars and sat in on one of these meetings, you would believe that a client’s success or progress was not part of the thought process at all.It makes me ill how callously people talk about ripping their clients off. Over the last 12 months I have seen five different managing directors refer to their own clients as “muppets,” sometimes over internal e-mail. Even after the S.E.C., Fabulous Fab, Abacus, God’s work, , Vampire Squids? No humility? I mean, come on. Integrity? It is eroding. I don’t know of any illegal behavior, but will people push the envelope and pitch lucrative and complicated products to clients even if they are not the simplest investments or the ones most directly aligned with the client’s goals? Absolutely. Every day, in fact.It astounds me how little senior management gets a basic truth: If clients don’t trust you they will eventually stop doing business with you. It doesn’t matter how smart you are.These days, the most common question I get from junior analysts about derivatives is, “How much money did we make off the client?” It bothers me every time I hear it, because it is a clear reflection of what they are observing from their leaders about the way they should behave. Now project 10 years into the future: You don’t have to be a rocket scientist to figure out that the junior analyst sitting quietly in the corner of the room hearing about “muppets,” “ripping eyeballs out” and “getting paid” doesn’t exactly turn into a model citizen.When I was a first-year analyst I didn’t know where the bathroom was, or how to tie my shoelaces. I was taught to be concerned with learning the ropes, finding out what a derivative was, understanding finance, getting to know our clients and what motivated them, learning how they defined success and what we could do to help them get there.My proudest moments in life — getting a full scholarship to go from to , being selected as a Rhodes Scholar national finalist, winning a bronze medal for table tennis at the Maccabiah Games in , known as the Jewish Olympics — have all come through hard work, with no shortcuts. Goldman Sachs today has become too much about shortcuts and not enough about achievement. It just doesn’t feel right to me anymore.I hope this can be a wake-up call to the board of directors. Make the client the focal point of your business again. Without clients you will not make money. In fact, you will not exist. Weed out the morally bankrupt people, no matter how much money they make for the firm. And get the culture right again, so people want to work here for the right reasons. People who care only about making money will not sustain this firm — or the trust of its clients — for very much longer.'"
"'12-03-14,'1','“I certainly think that we are seeing some serious issues there, but I think it is a national issue,” said Senator Patty Murray of Washington.Ms. Murray, a Democrat who is chairwoman of the Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee, has pushed the Army and the Pentagon to investigate how Madigan Army Medical Center, based at Lewis-McChord, handles mental health issues. Last week, she told The Seattle Times that the hospital had reversed 285 diagnoses of post-traumatic stress disorder. Critics say the changes may be linked to efforts to cut costs. Two doctors who screened for the disorder have been removed from that duty.In an interview on Tuesday, a senior noncommissioned officer at Fort Lewis, who recently received a diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder after two deployments in Iraq, said his superiors here initially expressed doubt about his condition.“It was greeted with great skepticism from my command,” the 40-year-old officer from Chicago said, referring to his provisional diagnosis during a pre-deployment screening by a doctor in October that was corroborated about a month later by a psychologist on the base.He recounted that a supervisor said to him that “The reality is that I am skeptical” and that, in his personal opinion, he was seeing an increasing number of soldiers use this as an excuse to put one over on the Army. “I was absolutely shocked that the word ‘skeptical’ came out,” the soldier said. “Here I have 13 years of active duty with two deployments, so the idea of me lying to get out of work came as a real blow.”After meetings with a military psychologist, the diagnosis was confirmed.Jorge Gonzalez, a veteran from Lewis-McChord who served 15 months in Iraq and now is executive director of Coffee Strong, a coffee house and nonprofit resource center for soldiers, said: “A huge problem is that the soldiers are not given time to heal before they are redeployed. It is a military-wide problem, and there is a lot of it going on at this base.”In the case of the soldier accused of the massacre on Sunday, the possibility that he experienced some form of traumatic brain injury, known as T.B.I., before his most recent deployment has prompted questions about whether he should have been sent to Afghanistan. The soldier, part of the Third Stryker Brigade, Second Infantry Division, had served three tours in Iraq and was sent to Afghanistan in December. He worked in support of Special Forces operations.But the reports about traumatic brain injury have also raised alarms among some veterans advocates, who say they are worried about broad-brush assessments of all combat veterans, particularly those with head injuries or post-traumatic stress disorder.“I know lots of people who have T.B.I., and that doesn’t make them killers of civilians,” said Paul Rieckhoff, executive director of Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America. “I think that it’s really important that we, as a community, push back on a rush to judgment, a rush to simplify.”Mr. Rieckhoff, an Iraq war veteran, said there seemed to be a “concentration of problems” at Joint Base Lewis-McChord, but a lack of clear data made it hard to draw conclusions about whether it had a higher level of crime, substance abuse, domestic violence or suicide than other bases.Of the Second Infantry Division’s three Stryker brigades, each containing roughly 4,000 soldiers, the Third Brigade has deployed the most: three times to Iraq before its current tour in Afghanistan. All of those were for 12 months, except for an extended 15-month tour in Iraq at the beginning of the surge, from June 2006 into September 2007.Joint Base Lewis-McChord had 16 soldiers commit suicide last year, the most of any Army post, Army statistics show. Since 2003, 68 soldiers from the base have killed themselves, among the higher totals for the Army in that period, but still below Fort Hood, Fort Campbell and Fort Bragg.'"

"'12-03-14,'1','A federal judge who sharply questioned whether the government had proved a fundamental part of its corruption case against a former Yonkers councilwoman has refused, for now, a defense request made on Tuesday that she dismiss crucial charges before the case went to a jury.The judge, Colleen McMahon of Federal District Court in Manhattan, said she would not yet rule on the matter, leaving open the possibility of a decision after the jury delivers a verdict.If the jury votes to convict the former councilwoman, Sandy Annabi, and a co-defendant, Zehy Jereis, the judge would have the power to direct an acquittal if she concluded the evidence was not sufficient to support a conviction. Ms. Annabi is accused of selling her vote for secret payments.Judge McMahon announced her decision after a spirited and at times contentious hearing outside the jury’s presence in which she expressed continued skepticism about whether prosecutors had adequately shown that Ms. Annabi agreed, as early as 2002, to officially act on behalf of Mr. Jereis, a former Yonkers Republican chairman, in return for close to $175,000 in payments from him and another man.Prosecutors contend that in return, Ms. Annabi dropped her opposition to an 81-acre luxury mall and residential project in Yonkers, known as Ridge Hill, and a second smaller project.Lawyers for Ms. Annabi and Mr. Jereis said Tuesday that the evidence simply was not there. Ms. Annabi’s lawyer, William I. Aronwald, said there was no evidence that the payments by Mr. Jereis “were in fact connected to any agreement between the two of them that she would at some point vote as he directed her to.”'"
"'12-03-14,'1','Iran signaled on Tuesday that it was unwilling to grant a request by international nuclear inspectors for unfettered access to a restricted military complex that they suspect may house a chamber designed to test explosives used in atomic weapons triggers.In its first public statement on the matter since the leader of the International Atomic Energy Agency expressed irritation last week about Iran’s lack of cooperation, Iran also denied suggestions that it had sought to cleanse the military complex, called Parchin, to eliminate any trace of incriminating activity.“The site is a military site, and conventional military activities are being carried out in the site,” the Foreign Ministry spokesman, Ramin Mehmanparast, said, according to Iranian news agencies. Ridiculing reports that Iran had tried to clean up the site, he said, “If military nuclear activities are carried out, evidence of them can never be cleaned up, and the issue is mostly propaganda.”Iran’s unwillingness to grant the inspectors’ request could complicate resumed talks announced last week between Iran and the five permanent United Nations Security Council members plus Germany over Iran’s nuclear energy program, an increasing source of world tension. Iran says the program is peaceful; Western nations and Israel say it is a cover for developing nuclear weapons capacity.A sprawling desert complex near Tehran, Parchin figured prominently in the atomic agency’s report on Iran’s nuclear activities last November. The report said Iran had constructed a containment vessel there in 2000 that may have been designed to conduct tests on explosives required to set off the type of reaction needed to detonate a nuclear bomb.On an earlier visit to Parchin, inspectors found nothing, but were not allowed free access. Inspectors were recently twice denied permission to visit the site.'"
"'12-03-14,'1','Concerned about the dampening effect that a fund-raising scandal involving the city comptroller could have on Asian-American voters, the New York City Campaign Finance Board held a workshop on Monday night on the dos and don’ts of campaign finance.The workshop was requested by a new coalition of community groups, the Asian American Civic Alliance, which was formed after the fund-raising woes of the comptroller, John C. Liu, who had been regarded until recently as a likely candidate for mayor, came to light. Over the course of two hours, Daniel Cho, the board’s director of candidate services, responded to granular questions about house parties and in-kind contributions, while also offering, with a PowerPoint slide show, broad guidelines on disclosure forms and personal information.¶Underscore just how important it is, legally, for donors to read and sign a contributor card affirming that they are not being reimbursed for their campaign contributions.¶Don’t forget to ask each contributor to fill out as much information about himself or herself — including place of employment — as possible.¶Remember, there is nothing wrong with being a bundler or an intermediary.Mr. Cho stressed that the workshop was not about “any specific candidate.” But there was little doubt that many people were thinking about Mr. Liu, whose campaign treasurer was arrested last month on charges of illegally directing campaign money using fake donors.Mr. Liu, the first Asian-American elected to citywide office, has long been a symbol of pride and achievement for a fast-growing population. So if he, or anyone close to him, becomes ensnarled in an investigation, many people would feel great disappointment, some workshop participants said.'"
"'12-03-14,'1','He added: “We hit rock bottom on this in 2010. Then we hit rock bottom in 2011. And we are still at rock bottom. We were vulnerable before and now we’re just more vulnerable. You can destroy physical infrastructure with a cyberattack just like you could with a bomb.”The legislation the administration is pressing Congress to pass would give the federal government greater authority to regulate the security used by companies that run the nation’s infrastructure. It would give the Homeland Security Department the authority to enforce minimum standards on companies whose service or product would lead to mass casualties, evacuations or major economic damage if crippled by hackers.The bill the administration backs is sponsored by Senators Joseph I. Lieberman, independent of Connecticut, and Susan Collins, Republican of Maine. It has bipartisan support, and its prospects appear good. Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, is sponsoring a more business-friendly bill that emphasizes the sharing of information and has fewer requirements for companies.Last week on Capitol Hill, Janet Napolitano, the secretary of Homeland Security; Robert S. Mueller III, the director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation; and Gen. Martin E. Dempsey, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, made their pitch to roughly four dozen senators about why they should pass the Lieberman-Collins bill.At a closed-door briefing, the senators were shown how a power company employee could derail the New York City electrical grid by clicking on an e-mail attachment sent by a hacker, and how an attack during a heat wave could have a cascading impact that would lead to deaths and cost the nation billions of dollars.“I think General Dempsey said it best when he said that prior to 9/11, there were all kinds of information out there that a catastrophic attack was looming,” Ms. Napolitano said in an interview. “The information on a cyberattack is at that same frequency and intensity and is bubbling at the same level, and we should not wait for an attack in order to do something.”General Dempsey told the senators that he had skipped a meeting of the National Security Council on Iran to attend the briefing because he was so concerned about a cyberattack, according to a person who had been told details of the meeting. A spokesman for General Dempsey said the chairman had “sent his vice chairman to the meeting on Iran so that he could attend the Senate meeting and emphasize his concern about cybersecurity.”“His point was about his presence at the cyber exercise rather than a value judgment on the ‘threat,’ ” the spokesman, Col. David Lapan, said.Experts say one of the biggest problems is that no part of the government has complete authority over the issue. The Central Intelligence Agency and the National Security Agency give the government intelligence on potential attacks, and the F.B.I. prosecutes hackers who break the law. The Department of Homeland Security receives reports about security breaches but has no authority to compel business to improve their security.“Nobody does critical infrastructure of the dot-com space where America now relies on faith healing and snake oil for protection,” Mr. Lewis said. “The administration wants it to be the Department of Homeland Security, but the department needs additional authorities to be effective.”'"
"'12-03-14,'1','Commissioner David Stern, from time to time, has suggested that the court of public opinion is harsher in its judgments of his very visible and predominantly African-American player base — hardly a radical contention. But Stan Van Gundy, the Magic coach, pointed out that when baseball stars become free agents, there is compensation for teams that lose them and few are affected in the way Cleveland was, for example, when James migrated to Miami.“In baseball you can pay Albert Pujols as much as you want and he may be the best hitter in the game, but you can still only hit him one out of every nine times at bat,” Van Gundy said. “His team’s not going to fall apart because he left. With us, you can go to Kobe Bryant, Dwyane Wade or LeBron James every time down the floor. It’s not, oops, we got five guys, he just had his turn, he’s got to wait four more.”True enough, when Pujols bailed on St. Louis for sunny Anaheim, few people outside eastern Missouri were insulted. Certainly no one in the White House was compelled to weigh in. But President Obama took the opportunity on Monday during a local television interview to address the fear and loathing that has enveloped central Florida, telling the host, “If I were the owner, I’d do everything I could to get him to stay.”How much is too much? According to an ESPN report, the Magic had already promised Howard the acquisition of a companion star and the privilege of determining the fates of Van Gundy and the general manager, Otis Smith. That precipitated a new round of news media teeth gnashing and maybe was why Van Gundy — after saying “if they want to fire me to please somebody, fine” — sounded like the only person in Orlando not ready to compare his team’s ordeal with the unimaginable departure of Disney.“From our standpoint, I wish we had a system where Dwight had no choice, but we’ve got to be fair to our players, too,” he said.As for what the N.F.L. has, the right to slap a franchise tag on a player to retain him, Van Gundy said: “If you want to do that, be fair, make the rule that you can’t trade anybody either. You draft them, you’re stuck with them.“Like everybody, we want it both ways. But I think our system is fair. It was negotiated. It’s not desirable what we’re going through, but it’s not anyone’s fault.”Not Howard’s. He has done his share over the last seven years to help the DeVos family build the gleaming Amway Center and maximize its revenues. He could decide to stay, or the Magic could retain him for the rest of the season, with no guarantees.“Well, I told those guys, I’ve been telling them for the past two or three weeks now that I want to stay and finish the season,” Howard said, putting the onus on the franchise to risk competitive bankruptcy and a repeat of what happened with Shaquille O’Neal in 1996.Compared with what Cleveland got for James, the Nets’ reported offer of Brook Lopez and other assets would be a haul. Maybe the Knicks owner James L. Dolan is beginning to realize he didn’t score the coup of the century in Carmelo Anthony and he will make a late bid.Meanwhile, Alex Martins, the Magic’s chief executive, said there are “plenty of teams” willing to take Howard as a short-term rental.When Howard said he wanted to stay Tuesday night, what he did was put the Magic in the position of having to make the most prudent business decision. Which is the game of professional sports, for all those who play.'"

"'12-03-14,'1','Interest rates were higher. The Treasury’s benchmark 10-year note fell 26/32, to 98 28/32, and the yield rose to 2.13 percent from 2.04 percent late Monday.Equity gains this year have been part of a general trend of solid corporate balance sheets and improving economic data. On Tuesday, the Commerce Department reported that retail sales in February were their strongest since September, rising 1.1 percent. The report included upward revisions from previous months, and it added to a positive picture of the economic recovery as the jobs market and consumer confidence improve.“We have had a good series of economic data come out the past few months,” said Jason D. Pride, the director of investment strategy for Glenmede. Noting the European debt crisis, he said, “We don’t think we are completely out of the woods, but at least those risk-of-downside items have been greatly diminished.”There could be some tests to the United States economy and consumers from higher gasoline prices and slowing global economy, said Jim Baird, the chief investment strategist for Plante Moran Financial Advisors, in a research statement.The S.& P.’s close on Tuesday was its highest since June 5, 2008, when it hit 1,404.05. Consumer discretionary stocks were up the most since then, or 35 percent, while financials did the worst, down 39 percent.The composition of the Nasdaq has changed over the years; many of the stocks from early 2000 no longer even listed. In the dot-com bubble, many companies did not have earnings, or even business models, to back up their lofty stock market valuations.Now, a handful of the 2,500 stocks in the index in particular have produced strong performances lately, like Apple. Apple, Microsoft, Oracle and Cisco account for 20 percent of the weight of the index.“The technology sector is as popular as ever, maybe not as crazy as it was back in the dot-com 1998-2000 time frame, but technology firms are pretty popular this time around,” said Paul Larson, chief equities strategist for Morningstar. “They also had strong underlying fundamentals to back up these prices.”In 2000, Mr. Larson said, “a lot of the blue-chip names were trading at 35 to 40 times their earnings. They did not have earnings to back up their lofty prices, at least not enough earnings to justify, or growth to justify, a 40 times multiple on the stock. But today the earnings have grown significantly.”Now, he said, Apple, Microsoft, Cisco and Oracle are trading in the low teens or single-digit multiples of earnings. The price/earnings ratio for the Nasdaq index over all is 24, compared with the S.& P.’s 14, while Nasdaq’s in 2000 was a sky-high 155.The recent ascent of technology stocks is restrained compared with the dot-com boom. And the shares of social networking and media companies like Yelp and Groupon have slipped after their initial public offerings. But there are some echoes of the unqualified optimism of the Internet bubble of more than a decade ago — in the surging salaries for engineers, the accommodating accounting applied to some young companies, and the ease with which start-ups, unproved and unprofitable, can attract investment money.Some analysts are approaching the new 3,000 level with caution, saying it might be more representative of a few companies than a trend that is happening for the collective group.The index is weighted by capitalization, which means about 500 technology stocks that trade on the Nasdaq exchange account for more than 48 percent of the index. Apple in particular continues to have an outsize influence on the overall Nasdaq. Its share price was just over $31 in March 2000, and it subsequently fell below $7. It is now over $500, closing up nearly 3 percent to $568.10.About 315 consumer services stocks account for about 18 percent and about 406 health care stocks for 12 percent. In a survey of stocks with market capitalizations of more than $1 billion at the end of February, Vivus Inc., a biopharmaceutical company, and Sears Holdings, the retailer, had gained more than 100 percent from the beginning of the year, making them among the top five gainers on the Nasdaq. Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, also a biopharmaceutical company, also was up nearly 100 percent.Mark Sue, a communications technology analyst with RBC Capital Markets, said the rise of the index was not broad-based, and market share shifted from one company at the expense of others.Apple gained market share from Research in Motion, Nokia and Motorola, for example. Cisco gained share from Nortel but in turn lost some share to Juniper Networks, which lost share to smaller players, Mr. Sue said. Ericsson gained share from smaller players only to cede margins to Chinese vendors. “So few things are constant in tech,” he added.The Nasdaq 100, which represents the largest market capitalization companies, closed 2.7 percent higher in 2011 over 2010, while the overall index finished 2011 down 1.8 percent, Mr. Sue noted. So the gain so far this year, “while encouraging, needs some sustainability to show that the environment is better and technology innovation is accelerating,” he said.The positive sentiment was felt across the Asia-Pacific region, too, on Wednesday, sending the Nikkei 225 up 2.1 percent by late morning in Tokyo. The benchmark indexes in Hong Kong, Singapore and Australia were 1 percent higher in morning trading, while the markets in Taiwan and South Korea gained 1.3 percent.'"
"'12-03-14,'1','An 18-year-old Tibetan monk, Gepey, died Saturday after setting himself on fire to protest Chinese rule in Tibetan areas, according to Free Tibet, an advocacy group based in London.Gepey was from Kirti Monastery in Sichuan Province, which is the epicenter of the wave of self-immolations that began in March 2011. Since then, at least 26 Tibetans have set fire to themselves across the Tibetan plateau, and at least 18 have died. Gepey committed self-immolation on the anniversary of an ill-fated Tibetan uprising against Chinese occupiers in 1959 that resulted in the Dalai Lama fleeing to India.Free Tibet said Gepey killed himself behind a military building in the town of Aba, known in Tibetan as Ngaba. He was the third Tibetan in a row to self-immolate by a building that symbolizes China’s crackdown in Tibet, the group said. It added that security officers took away Gepey’s body, and the authorities did not allow traditional funeral rites to be performed for fear of the ceremony turning into a protest.'"

"'12-03-15,'1','On Tuesday, the Federal Reserve concluded that 15 of the 19 banks it examined would be able to maintain a minimum capital level during a severe economic crisis. That cleared the way for those banks to bolster dividend payments to shareholders and initiate a round of share buybacks.It also set off a debate among economists and banking analysts about whether banks have actually achieved renewed strength.“The Fed has essentially appeased critics and proclaimed the banks healthy without doing real due diligence,” said Anat R. Admati, a professor of finance and economics at Stanford.The Fed has maintained that its examination of banks was extremely rigorous. On Tuesday, a senior Federal Reserve official countered any worries about the health of most banks, noting that despite dividend plans, the banks would all have more capital by the end of the year than they had at the start of the year. That is because banks, even after increasing shareholder payouts this year, will still retain more profits because the dividends will be lower than they were before the financial crisis. Despite paying out dividends last year, they bolstered their capital by $52 billion in 2011.Healthy banks should be able to reward their shareholders with dividend payments, some banking analysts said.“The scenarios were incredibly severe, and the banks fared extremely well,” said Michael Scanlon, a senior equity analyst with Manulife Asset Management in Boston.First out of the gate, JPMorgan Chase announced Tuesday that it would buy back roughly $12 billion in stock this year and increase its quarterly dividend payment by a nickel, to 30 cents.Others quickly followed suit, bolstered by passing the Fed’s test. Wells Fargo increased its dividend by 10 cents, to 22 cents. John Stumpf, the bank’s chairman and chief executive said, “We are extremely pleased to reward our shareholders.”American Express, the credit card issuer, also announced it would increase its quarterly dividend by 2 cents, to 20 cents a share. Meanwhile, U.S. Bancorp raised its quarterly dividend, too, by 7 cents, to 19.5 cents.The latest tests were the third that banks have been subjected to in the wake of the financial crisis. While some complained that the tests were too harsh, forcing industry titans like Citigroup to shelve plans for a dividend payment, some economists, including Professor Admati, have raised an alarm, saying the tests were not hard enough.“Why are we letting banks hand out dividend payments and encouraging risky behavior after they passed flimsy tests?” she said. “It’s frankly dangerous, and the Fed should not allow it.”Rebel A. Cole, a former Fed economist and a professor of finance at DePaul University, said that the stress tests created too rosy a picture, drastically understating how a financial crisis would impact banks’ balance sheets.Even though the tests assumed a grim economic situation, with unemployment surging to 13 percent and housing prices plummeting by 21 percent, they failed to register how deeply banks’ holdings, like mortgages and credit cards, would suffer.For instance, the tests assumed that banks could lose up to $56 billion on home equity lines of credit and second-lien mortgages, or roughly 13 percent of their portfolio. That’s too low, Mr. Cole said. “Those loss rates don’t even pass the smell test,” he said. In an economic downturn, more underwater homeowners would default on their loans, he said.Another problem with the tests, critics said, was that they underestimated the legal liabilities that might still be lurking for banks as they work through a backlog of soured mortgages.In its analysis of Bank of America, the Fed predicted the firm could withstand up to $60 billion in losses over the next two years, without increasing its current dividend of 1 cent a quarter. But Professor Cole said that Bank of America’s liabilities on those mortgages — especially if the bank has to pay more money to investors who are demanding that the bank reimburse them for losses on mortgage bonds — could far exceed that $60 billion mark.In addition, the Fed too heavily relies on 2008 and 2009 to create its nightmare economic situations, he said. For example, the Fed situation expected that interest rates on 10-year Treasuries would plunge to 1.64 percent, without factoring in a different circumstance where interest rates could surge and undercut loan demand.In addition, the tests did not take into account difficulties that the banks might face in borrowing money. Without that, the tests could potentially be incomplete, Mr. Barofsky said.Instead of allowing banks to return money to shareholders, the Fed should force them to retain it, he said. “In this case, the Fed is acting as enabler,” he said.Banks had long been a reliable source of income for shareholders through dividends, until the rising payouts were essentially wiped out as the financial crisis crippled the banks and they sought federal money to survive. Shareholders have been pressuring banks to increase the payouts, eager to recoup losses on financial stocks.Citigroup was among those that were not permitted to raise dividends. It had paid a hefty 54 cent quarterly dividend to shareholders before the financial crisis. Now, the bank pays 1 cent a share. The Fed quashed Citi’s latest effort to increase dividend payouts for shareholders. The regulator determined that despite two years of profits, Citi would not have enough capital to increase its dividend payments while still weathering a financial crisis even more severe than 2008’s. Neither Citi nor the Fed disclosed how much the bank wanted to raise the payout.Still, Citi will try again, resubmitting a revised proposal to the central bank later this year.'"

"'12-03-15,'1','Thirteen Cuban dissidents have holed up in a Roman Catholic church in Havana to press for an audience with Pope Benedict XVI when he visits Cuba in two weeks. The protesters, through an intermediary, said they wanted to discuss human rights grievances against the Castro government. On Wednesday, only pilgrims visiting an image of the Virgin of Charity of Cobre, Cuba’s patroness, were permitted inside the Church of Charity in central Havana, where the dissidents had gathered. There was no sign of any police presence, and activity on the street outside appeared to be normal. “They entered the church last night and stayed. They will not budge from there,” said William Cepera, a dissident who spoke for those inside. Mr. Cepera said that the group was in a closed room and that he had spoken with them through a window that was later closed. “We would like to talk with the pope and tell him that the government of Fidel and Raúl has released only some prisoners, but other political prisoners remain,” Mr. Cepera said.'"

"'12-03-15,'1','Noble Fleming, who for nearly 50 years sipped and sniffed from teaspoons and fine china cups to ensure the quality of tea for millions of Americans, died on Feb. 24 at a nursing home in Saint-Vaast-la-Hougue, France. He was 92.Mr. Fleming, an Englishman known in the industry as Toby, was head of Royal Estates Tea, the subsidiary that bought tea from around the world for the Thomas J. Lipton Company, whose brand is the biggest seller in the United States. In that capacity he was perhaps the industry’s leading tea taster, almost always fulfilling the role in a finely tailored suit.“Toby was legendary; he held one of the most powerful positions in the industry,” said Joe Simrany, president of the Tea Association of the U.S.A.For decades, starting as a teenage apprentice, Mr. Fleming traveled to tea estates of 1,000 acres or more — primarily in India, Sri Lanka and East Africa — searching for varieties with specific tastes in the way an oenologist knows a chateau wine. Based on soil, elevation, rainfall, temperature and how the estate was managed, he would make an initial assessment of the tea’s quality.Back at the company’s laboratorylike tasting room in Englewood Cliffs, N.J., Mr. Fleming and his handful of experts would study the tone of the leaves (brightness indicated enhanced flavor), place them in white bone china cups lined up in rows, steep them in purified water, add a precise amount of skim milk and then sip.'"
"'12-03-15,'1','“I favor the Violence Against Women Act and have supported it at various points over the years, but there are matters put on that bill that almost seem to invite opposition,” said Senator , Republican of , who opposed the latest version last month in the Judiciary Committee. “You think that’s possible? You think they might have put things in there we couldn’t support that maybe then they could accuse you of not being supportive of fighting violence against women?”The legislation would continue existing grant programs to local law enforcement and battered women shelters, but would expand efforts to reach Indian tribes and rural areas. It would increase the availability of free legal assistance to victims of domestic violence, extend the definition of violence against women to include stalking, and provide training for civil and criminal court personnel to deal with families with a history of violence. It would also allow more battered illegal immigrants to claim temporary visas, and would include same-sex couples in programs for domestic violence.Republicans say the measure, under the cloak of battered women, unnecessarily expands avenues by creating new definitions for immigrant victims to claim battery. More important, they say, it fails to put in safeguards to ensure that domestic violence grants are being well spent. It also dilutes the focus on domestic violence by expanding protections to new groups, like same-sex couples, they say.Critics of the legislation acknowledged that the name alone presents a challenge if they intend to oppose it over some of its specific provisions.“Obviously, you want to be for the title,” Senator of , a member of the Republican leadership, said of the Violence Against Women Act. “If Republicans can’t be for it, we need to have a very convincing alternative.”The latest Senate version of the bill has five Republican co-sponsors, including of , a co-author, but it failed to get a single Republican vote in the Judiciary Committee last month.As suggested by Mr. Sessions, Republicans detect a whiff of politics in the Democrats’ timing. The party just went through a bruising fight over efforts to replace the Obama administration’s contraception-coverage mandate with legislation allowing some employers to opt out of coverage for medical procedures they object to on religious or moral grounds.Polling appears mixed over which side gained political ground on the fight, but Republican lawmakers are not eager to revisit it. State efforts in and to mandate ultrasounds before an abortion or ban abortions once a heartbeat is detected have further inflamed passions. And the on Wednesday pounced on a suggestion by that he would eliminate federal financing for .“There are lots of other issues right now that could be dealt with other than this one,” said Senator , Republican of , who is responsible for Republican messaging. “I suspect there’s a reason for bringing it up now.”But if Republican lawmakers are not eager to oppose a domestic violence bill, conservative activists are for a fight. Janice Shaw Crouse, a senior fellow at the conservative Concerned Women for America, said her group had been pressing senators hard to oppose reauthorization of legislation she called “a boondoggle” that vastly expands government and “creates an ideology that all men are guilty and all women are victims.”Last month on the conservative Web site , the conservative icon Phyllis Schlafly called the Violence Against Women Act a slush fund “used to fill feminist coffers” and demanded that Republicans stand up against legislation that promotes “divorce, breakup of marriage and hatred of men.”The third reauthorization effort of the legislation started off in November the way the previous efforts had, with a bipartisan bill and little controversy. The measure, authored by Senators Crapo and , Democrat of , attracted 58 co-sponsors, including Republicans and of , Ms. Murkowski, of and of .But Senator of , the senior Republican on the Judiciary Committee, found multiple reasons to oppose the bill when it came up for a formal consideration last month.The legislation “creates so many new programs for underserved populations that it risks losing the focus on helping victims, period,” Mr. Grassley said when the committee took up the measure. After his alternative version was voted down on party lines, the original passed without a Republican vote.Senator , Democrat of , one of two women on the judiciary panel, said the partisan opposition came as a “real surprise,” but she put it into a broader picture.“This is part of a larger effort, candidly, to cut back on rights and services to women,” she said. “We’ve seen it go from discussions on Roe v. Wade, to partial birth abortion, to contraception, to preventive services for women. This seems to be one more thing.”Republicans say they see that line of attack coming and will try through amendments to make the final version more palatable. But if Democrats dig in, Republicans will stand their ground, Mr. Blunt said, pointing to a new New York Times/CBS News poll that showed Americans supporting an exemption to the contraception mandate for religiously affiliated employers 57 percent to 36 percent. By 51 percent to 40 percent, Americans appeared to back Senate efforts to grant employers an exemption on religious or moral exemption grounds.“Our friends on the other side are in serious danger of overplaying their hand on this one,” Mr. Blunt said.'"
"'12-03-15,'1','In addition, a bipartisan coalition of lawmakers is resuscitating a bill to overhaul the way the prison manufacturing company does business, proposing to eliminate its preferential status.Under current practice — governed by intricate laws, regulations and policies — an agency must buy prisoner-made goods if the company offers an item that is comparable in price, quality and time of delivery to that of the private sector, with certain exceptions. The company’s prices are not always the lowest, but it frequently has been able to underbid private companies, Congressional aides say.The bill seeks to limit those advantages by putting a limit on F.P.I.’s sales to the federal government, opening more product areas to private companies and strengthening requirements that the prices for prisoner-made products be competitive. The legislation would also impose federal work-safety standards and higher wages, starting at $2.50 an hour.Separately, Senator McConnell has introduced a bill that would subject the Bureau of Prisons, including its manufacturing company, to greater Congressional oversight.F.P.I. has traditionally relied on office furniture, electronics and clothing manufacturing for the bulk of its business, but it has been moving into new industries like renewable energy. The company already has one factory each in New York and Oregon to build solar panels and is looking into making energy-efficient lighting and small wind turbines.“This is a threat to not just established industries; it’s a threat to emerging industries,” said Representative Bill Huizenga, a Michigan Republican who is the lead sponsor of the proposed overhaul legislation. “If China did this — having their prisoners work at subpar wages in prisons — we would be screaming bloody murder.”Begun in 1934 as a way to teach inmates useful skills and help supply federal agencies with needed products, Federal Prison Industries is something of an anachronism. Its operations are patterned after a “mass-production, low-skilled labor economy of the 1930s,” according to a report last year from the Congressional Research Service. It is at root a correctional program intended to keep inmates busy (and therefore less likely to become violent), reinforce the value of work and the sense of self-worth work can provide, and reduce recidivism. It is inefficient by design, employing as many inmates as possible, which diminishes the advantage of its low wages.“The program has been important to the Federal Bureau of Prisons for a long time,” said George Keiser, a consultant and former official at the National Institute of Corrections in the Justice Department. “It’s one of the areas where they can demonstrate a high correlation between people who work in prison industries and who eventually, as they return to their communities, have a higher-than-average success rate at not being rearrested, not being reconvicted and not returning to prison.”According to the Bureau of Prisons, inmates who go through the program are 24 percent less likely to return to jail and 14 percent more likely to find employment upon release because of the skills and experience they receive. The program operates in a range of industries — including fleet management and data services — to lessen the effect on any particular one. Over the years, its board has adopted various resolutions to reduce competition with small businesses, like raising the threshold for buying the prisoner-made goods to $3,000, from $25, and eliminating its preferential status for products when the prison share of the federal market rises above certain levels.“F.P.I. supplies only a small fraction of the government’s goods and services,” Traci Billingsley, a spokeswoman for the Bureau of Prisons, said in a prepared statement. “F.P.I. also helps support American jobs as it often partners with private American companies as a supplier.” (Mr. Eisen said Tennier once received a contract to provide precut fabric for military gear to the government company so it could avoid having inmates use cutting equipment.)With a tight economy, dwindling agency budgets and past Congressional moves to weaken its preferential status, the prison manufacturing company has faced its own business pressures, closing down some factories and employing fewer inmates. Its overall sales fell to about $745 million in fiscal 2011 from about $772 million the year before, according to its annual report to Congress. Its net loss narrowed to $1.8 million from $56.3 million the year before, when it took $35 million in write-offs for defective helmets recalled by the military — still the subject of a Justice Department investigation — and for solar cells.“F.P.I. continues to face the negative impact of economic and legislative forces,” the report says. “F.P.I. continues to address these external challenges through aggressively pursuing new customers and new products, involvement in legislative initiatives, capacity reductions and strict measures to control cash.”The move into solar panels and other energy technologies is meant to help government agencies meet mandates for using energy from renewable sources and to “provide inmates with job skills in a new and growing market,” according to Julie Rozier, a spokeswoman for the company.Across the country, some correctional facilities have begun preparing inmates for the green economy, offering training in solar panel installation and energy-efficient heating, ventilation and cooling systems. Inmates do not install solar panels, but assemble them; when fully operational, the plants in Otisville, N.Y., and Sheridan, Ore., can employ about 400 inmates and produce 75 megawatts’ worth of panels a year, Ms. Rozier said.So far, response from the solar industry has been measured, with representatives saying that production is too small to pose a serious threat. A pool of trained solar workers might even be beneficial, the Solar Energy Industries Association says.But industries that have long been competing against the federal company, like the clothing and furniture industries, are leaning on lawmakers to do something.Chris Reynolds, president of Campbellsville Apparel in Kentucky, said he had contacted Senator McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, to express concern about possible competition for his military T-shirt contract, a move that inspired Mr. McConnell’s bill.“My employees just cannot believe the fact that a prisoner who should be paying a debt to society is being promoted through the federal government to take a job from an American taxpaying citizen,” he said.'"
"'12-03-15,'1','LONDON — In what could prove to be one of the most damaging chapters yet in the scandal enveloping Rupert Murdoch’s tabloid newspapers in Britain, Scotland Yard arrested a former chief reporter for The News of the World on Wednesday on suspicion of intimidating a witness, the first time the police have raised the specter of witness tampering in the course of their investigations.A police statement said a 51-year-old man had been “arrested by appointment” at a central London police station “on suspicion of intimidation of a witness” and of “encouraging or assisting” a related offense. The statement did not name the man, but former employees of News International, the British newspaper subsidiary of Mr. Murdoch’s News Corporation, identified him as Neville Thurlbeck, who was fired by News International last summer after 21 years with The News of the World.Mr. Murdoch shut down The News of the World, a Sunday paper, in July amid a wave of revelations about its use of cellphone hacking. Police inquiries have widened to include The Sun, the daily newspaper that is the most profitable and most widely circulated of the Murdoch newspaper titles in Britain, and a broad range of suspected criminal wrongdoing.As Mr. Thurlbeck was undergoing questioning, a parliamentary committee released a new letter from Mr. Murdoch’s 39-year-old son, James, who until his recent resignation as chairman of News International was the overall head of the newspaper operations in Britain.In the seven-page letter, James Murdoch expressed his “great and real regret” over the cellphone hacking. But he insisted that he had not misled Parliament in his two extended appearances before the committee last year, and that he had not engaged in a cover-up.“I did not know about, nor did I try to hide, wrongdoing,” he said. “I do not believe the evidence before you supports any other conclusion.”'"
"'12-03-15,'1','On Tuesday, the Federal Reserve concluded that 15 of the 19 banks it examined would be able to maintain a minimum capital level during a severe economic crisis. That cleared the way for those banks to bolster dividend payments to shareholders and initiate a round of share buybacks.It also set off a debate among economists and banking analysts about whether banks have actually achieved renewed strength.“The Fed has essentially appeased critics and proclaimed the banks healthy without doing real due diligence,” said Anat R. Admati, a professor of finance and economics at Stanford.The Fed has maintained that its examination of banks was extremely rigorous. On Tuesday, a senior Federal Reserve official countered any worries about the health of most banks, noting that despite dividend plans, the banks would all have more capital by the end of the year than they had at the start of the year. That is because banks, even after increasing shareholder payouts this year, will still retain more profits because the dividends will be lower than they were before the financial crisis. Despite paying out dividends last year, they bolstered their capital by $52 billion in 2011.Healthy banks should be able to reward their shareholders with dividend payments, some banking analysts said.“The scenarios were incredibly severe, and the banks fared extremely well,” said Michael Scanlon, a senior equity analyst with Manulife Asset Management in Boston.First out of the gate, JPMorgan Chase announced Tuesday that it would buy back roughly $12 billion in stock this year and increase its quarterly dividend payment by a nickel, to 30 cents.Others quickly followed suit, bolstered by passing the Fed’s test. Wells Fargo increased its dividend by 10 cents, to 22 cents. John Stumpf, the bank’s chairman and chief executive said, “We are extremely pleased to reward our shareholders.”American Express, the credit card issuer, also announced it would increase its quarterly dividend by 2 cents, to 20 cents a share. Meanwhile, U.S. Bancorp raised its quarterly dividend, too, by 7 cents, to 19.5 cents.The latest tests were the third that banks have been subjected to in the wake of the financial crisis. While some complained that the tests were too harsh, forcing industry titans like Citigroup to shelve plans for a dividend payment, some economists, including Professor Admati, have raised an alarm, saying the tests were not hard enough.“Why are we letting banks hand out dividend payments and encouraging risky behavior after they passed flimsy tests?” she said. “It’s frankly dangerous, and the Fed should not allow it.”Rebel A. Cole, a former Fed economist and a professor of finance at DePaul University, said that the stress tests created too rosy a picture, drastically understating how a financial crisis would impact banks’ balance sheets.Even though the tests assumed a grim economic situation, with unemployment surging to 13 percent and housing prices plummeting by 21 percent, they failed to register how deeply banks’ holdings, like mortgages and credit cards, would suffer.For instance, the tests assumed that banks could lose up to $56 billion on home equity lines of credit and second-lien mortgages, or roughly 13 percent of their portfolio. That’s too low, Mr. Cole said. “Those loss rates don’t even pass the smell test,” he said. In an economic downturn, more underwater homeowners would default on their loans, he said.Another problem with the tests, critics said, was that they underestimated the legal liabilities that might still be lurking for banks as they work through a backlog of soured mortgages.In its analysis of Bank of America, the Fed predicted the firm could withstand up to $60 billion in losses over the next two years, without increasing its current dividend of 1 cent a quarter. But Professor Cole said that Bank of America’s liabilities on those mortgages — especially if the bank has to pay more money to investors who are demanding that the bank reimburse them for losses on mortgage bonds — could far exceed that $60 billion mark.In addition, the Fed too heavily relies on 2008 and 2009 to create its nightmare economic situations, he said. For example, the Fed situation expected that interest rates on 10-year Treasuries would plunge to 1.64 percent, without factoring in a different circumstance where interest rates could surge and undercut loan demand.In addition, the tests did not take into account difficulties that the banks might face in borrowing money. Without that, the tests could potentially be incomplete, Mr. Barofsky said.Instead of allowing banks to return money to shareholders, the Fed should force them to retain it, he said. “In this case, the Fed is acting as enabler,” he said.Banks had long been a reliable source of income for shareholders through dividends, until the rising payouts were essentially wiped out as the financial crisis crippled the banks and they sought federal money to survive. Shareholders have been pressuring banks to increase the payouts, eager to recoup losses on financial stocks.Citigroup was among those that were not permitted to raise dividends. It had paid a hefty 54 cent quarterly dividend to shareholders before the financial crisis. Now, the bank pays 1 cent a share. The Fed quashed Citi’s latest effort to increase dividend payouts for shareholders. The regulator determined that despite two years of profits, Citi would not have enough capital to increase its dividend payments while still weathering a financial crisis even more severe than 2008’s. Neither Citi nor the Fed disclosed how much the bank wanted to raise the payout.Still, Citi will try again, resubmitting a revised proposal to the central bank later this year.'"
"'12-03-15,'1','Alabama, of course, was not the only part of the South involved in the civil rights movement. But some of the most infamous scenes unfolded in the blocks surrounding the 58,000-square-foot institute. Opened 20 years ago, the museum was built directly across the street from the Sixteenth Street Baptist Church, where on Sept. 15, 1963, a bomb planted by segregationists killed four black girls. The blocklong museum faces Kelly Ingram Park, where earlier that same year, the public safety commissioner, Bull Connor, blasted protesters with fire hoses and set dogs on them. Many of the protesters, who were trying to march in protest of racial segregation laws, were children.The institute is one of the largest and oldest of about a dozen civil rights-themed museums in the South. It was the inspiration of a group of residents led by Richard Arrington Jr., who in 1979 — barely 15 years after the worst of the unrest — was elected the city’s first black mayor. “We felt it was important for people from Birmingham to tell the story of this period and not let others tell it for us,” said Mr. Arrington, who retired in 1999 after five terms as mayor. The initial response from the local business community was not enthusiastic, he said. “I was told that we were only going to reopen old wounds,” he said, and there was concern that it would be a “museum of hate,” or even a magnet for radicals.Birmingham’s African-American population was supportive of the idea of a museum, Mr. Arrington said, “until I explained that we’d have to raise property taxes in order to fund it.” He chuckled as he recalled the reactions recently while sitting in the institute’s boardroom. “They grew cool very quickly.”Referendums to pay for the museum were held in 1986 and in 1988. Both were defeated. “That caught me completely off guard,” Mr. Arrington acknowledged. “I was thinking about forgetting the whole idea, but the advisory board encouraged me to continue the fight.”The mayor decided to do a risky end run around the voters: He was able to sell some city property and, using a loophole in the law, direct the money to building the museum, which opened in November 1992. Twenty years later, the Birmingham Civil Rights Institute attracts about 150,000 visitors annually — including Barack Obama (who visited while he was a state senator), former President Jimmy Carter, the author Toni Morrison and Lynne Cheney, the wife of Dick Cheney, the former vice president. Museum officials said Mrs. Cheney donated $5,000 after her visit.The institute also houses a growing archive of documents and about 500 recorded oral histories related to the civil rights period.In 2005, the institute was the second African-American-themed museum in the country to be accredited by the American Association of Museums. It is also an affiliate of the Smithsonian Institution. Perhaps most surprising, at least to its early critics, is that it has become a major tourist attraction.In 2006, the institute’s president and chief executive, Lawrence J. Pijeaux Jr., was named Alabama’s tourism executive of the year. “Can you imagine that?” said Dr. Pijeaux, a native of New Orleans who has a doctorate in education and became president three years after the institute opened. “A black man who is leading an institution that chronicles all this unpleasant racial history in the state of Alabama” — he paused — “was selected as the state’s tourist executive of the year? It shows you how far things have come.”The story told to visitors starts with the history of Birmingham, a thriving industrial center in the first half of the 20th century, then explains why it became “Bombingham,” a battleground in the larger civil rights movement.Exhibits include a stylized rendition of the heavily segregated city in the 1950s, replete with vintage water fountains designated for use by race, and a sobering side-by-side comparison of white and black classrooms of the time. The classroom for white students has a motion-picture projector and glossy textbooks, while the classroom for black students is furnished with little more than beat-up wooden desks.Many artifacts are on display, like one of the armored police vehicles used by Connor to attack the marchers and a replica of a burned-out Freedom Rider bus. There is also the actual barred door from the city jail cell in which the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., arrested in April 1963 during the demonstrations, wrote his “Letter from Birmingham Jail,” a defense of his tactics that is now considered a definitive document in human rights literature.The Rev. Gordon Gibson, a white Unitarian minister who was arrested in Selma in 1964 along with Dr. King, now leads civil rights heritage tours and considers the institute and the National Civil Rights Museum in Memphis two of the best museums on the period. Still, he can understand the institute’s incubation struggles. “I’m sure they had a lot of resistance, and not just from whites,” said Mr. Gibson, who lives in Knoxville, Tenn. “I’m sure there were some from among the movement who might say, ‘Don’t try to stick me in a museum. That’s not going to tell what it was like to face down Bull Connor.’ ”Veterans of the Birmingham civil rights campaign — which was led by the Rev. Fred L. Shuttlesworth, the charismatic Baptist minister whose statue is in front of the institute — didn’t always agree with museum organizers. “Some of the foot soldiers didn’t trust us,” recalled Odessa Woolfolk, a former chairwoman of the museum’s board who led its planning committee. “We also got a lot of ‘you didn’t hear the real story about what happened that day.’ ”Ultimately, the community coalesced around the institute. So has Birmingham’s business sector, which now contributes significantly to the museum’s annual $2.2 million budget and also holds corporate events at the institute.The interpretation that the institute’s planners settled on — and will celebrate in November with a dinner gala and a weeklong series of educational events — is evenhanded and without a sense of triumphalism.“It’s a story with a complicated ending,” said Ms. Woolfolk, acknowledging the racial issues that still affect both her city and her country. “But it’s a story in which hope prevailed.”'"
"'12-03-15,'1','I was fortunate to have worked for the firm for 34 years in two divisions, fixed income and investment management. During my career I had the privilege of working with outstanding people who exhibited the highest business standards and integrity.The firm’s leadership from the days of Gus Levy, John Whitehead and John Weinberg through present management always stressed the importance of the client’s coming first. All of us in leadership positions were expected to live by a very high standard of excellence and to be role models for our younger colleagues.Goldman Sachs continues to be a leading market maker in thousands of global securities, and its willingness to risk its own capital on behalf of clients is unparalleled in the industry. Mr. Smith’s comments are inconsistent with the firm I proudly knew.The writer is a retired managing director of Goldman Sachs.What Greg Smith’s article leads to is the need for the compensation model for brokers and financial advisers to change.Instead of fees for transactions, remuneration should be based on a percentage of profit for the institutional or individual investor. That way, the culture will alter for the good.I worked in the derivatives industry at a firm owned by a foreign bank for more than 15 years before voluntarily retiring because I had achieved my career goals there.When a business or a person deals with a third party that is selling something, the vast majority of sellers are seeking to maximize profits. That’s capitalism, and it’s self-adjusting: if a seller is perceived to provide a poor value proposition by its customers (whether it actually rakes in huge profits or not), the customers go elsewhere and that seller either improves the bargain or eventually ceases to do business altogether. Morally there is nothing wrong with this, and it happens with just about every business in every industry.When you walk into a car dealer, the No. 1 goal of that dealer is to sell you a car — and quickly — so you don’t buy another brand or even the same brand from another dealer. All other things being equal, he’d like to sell you the car that makes him the most profit.But before the dealer can do that, he must juggle things to convince you that the car is the best one for you and is a good value. It may or may not be the best car for you or the best value; that’s where you, as the buyer, must decide whom to do business with.If you perceive the seller as “ripping [your] eyeballs out,” you are likely to go elsewhere, and if you do, you send a message to the seller that he needs to change his strategy. That’s how our system works, and the seller is doing nothing wrong if he is obeying the law, which Greg Smith concedes is true in the case of Goldman Sachs.The most successful long-term businesses balance doing what’s right by the client with selling a profitable product, and Goldman is no different, never was and never will be. For buyers, the old two-word adage still holds: caveat emptor (let the buyer beware).The world will aptly take notice of Greg Smith’s article. He was able to eloquently and resolutely express what is wrong with Goldman Sachs and probably the financial system at large. While unexpected, his commentary is largely a reiteration of what most of us already assumed to be a corrupt system.Substantially more powerful and disruptive, however, would be if Mr. Smith’s resignation inspired the less vocal minority of “everyday workers” to speak out against the injustices they, too, see in their workplaces.Coming from a Fortune 500 company, I have seen no lack of barely short-of-illegal corruption, practices well known even at the organization’s lowest echelons.Mr. Smith’s brave act should be an impetus for others to expose their own knowledge of morally bankrupt business practices, and to reveal even more shocking truths about our broken system.Greg Smith’s article about his decision to leave Goldman Sachs highlights only one part of the problem with our financial system. He warns that Goldman’s culture is dedicated only to increasing its own profits at the expense of its clients, and that it risks the loss of these clients if it continues to ignore the clients’ interests. But is anyone surprised by Goldman’s conduct? I think not.The other half of the problem is that the ultimate clients of Goldman are not truly represented. The large corporations, the asset managers, the hedge funds, and mutual and pension funds are the immediate clients of Goldman, and they are run by fund managers and the corporate officers who are acting in the same fashion as Goldman’s managers — maximizing their own profits at the expense of their clients (the shareholders and investors).Quis custodiet ipsos custodes? (Who watches the watchmen?) No one.'"

"'12-03-15,'1','Apparently triggered by a vacation trip the designers Jack McCollough and Lazaro Hernandez made to Santa Fe, N.M., land of the broomstick skirt, the jackalope and the howling blue coyote, the collection either inspired a raft of imitators or blundered into a stealth trend.Anna Sui got on board, and so did Mathew Williamson, Etro and Levi’s Workwear. Nike introduced some anomalous sneaker-style moccasins.The French designer Isabel Marant produced a spring collection that draws on the stylized motifs of Navajo sand paintings and the arts of the Southwestern Pueblo tribes. In cities like Los Angeles, Ms. Marant’s skinny jeans ornamented with Navajo-style patterns quickly went celebrity-viral, if that term can be used for material goods. To judge from the catalogs of high-end retailers like Bergdorf Goodman, New York is due for an Indian spring.On either coast, the cliché references have been dusted off: squash blossom necklaces, beadwork, feathers, turquoise jewelry, Minnetonka moccasins, Pendleton-blanket jackets, clunky silver, fringed anything. Trend-establishing shops like Rene Holguin’s RTH on La Cienega Boulevard in West Hollywood, Calif., have lately begun looking like satellites of some Wild West trading post.It was probably inevitable that mass merchandisers would seize on a trend that requires little beyond bowdlerized graphics and ornamental doodads to telegraph cultural reference, and just as likely that items like Urban Outfitter’s Navajo Printed Hipster Panty would also turn up soon enough to inflame Native American sensibilities.In its complaint last October, the Navajo Nation singled out the panties as “derogatory and scandalous,” along with a Navajo Print Wrapped Fabric Flask, an association the group considered particularly objectionable, given that the sale and consumption of alcohol is banned on the 25,000-square-mile reservation.Though the company eventually withdrew certain Navajo inspired products from its Web site, others continued to appear in catalogs and Web sites for brands like Free People, which Urban Outfitters controls.The lawsuit, filed in February in United States District Court in New Mexico, alleged violations of trademark law and the federal Indian Arts and Crafts Act, which makes it illegal to suggest that goods are of authentic Indian manufacture when they are not.“The fame or reputation of the Navajo name and marks is such that, when defendant uses the ‘Navajo’ and ‘Navaho’ marks with its goods and services, a connection with the Navajo Nation is falsely presumed,” the suit alleged. The Navajo Nation holds 10 registered trademarks covering a variety of household and apparel goods bearing the Navajo name. (Urban Outfitters did not respond to repeated requests for comment.)Of course, what was partly lost in all this is that the Navajo Nation is hardly walled off from American pop culture. At the sartorial and possibly other levels, as well, the Navajos evoked by Navajo chic may be a dwindling few. While the traditional folkways of the country’s most populous tribe remain vital to an aging population, you won’t find many young Navajos in the trappings of Navajo chic.Bashas’ supermarket in the Tseyi’ Shopping Center serves the town of Chinle, just outside the sacred Navajo site and national monument at Canyon de Chelly. As the only major supermarket for miles around, Bashas’ offers a fairly representative cross section of the population on the reservation.And, whether there or at the nearby Pic-n-Run or the local franchise of Church’s Chicken or at Wildcats games at Chinle High School, the majority of those not old enough for Social Security appear to favor the uniform most other Americans do: hoodies, T-shirts and baggy jeans.Elderly couples can still be seen at Bashas’, having driven long distances from farmsteads dotted throughout the vast reservation. Their pickups are often piled high with cordwood or potable water. Women wear long flounced skirts, velveteen blouses, Pendleton jackets and the weighty turquoise jewelry that represents portable wealth in a culture with historically limited access to banks.Like most of the old, they favor sensible shoes over flimsy moccasins. The men, with their typical barrel chests encased in Carhartt jackets, narrow hips snug in Wranglers and black felt Stetsons with upturned brims, epitomize an equally endangered form of classic cowboy style.“Nowadays we don’t wear it anymore,” said Alex Mitchell, an associate at the museum of Dine College, a two-year tribal college in Tsaile, Ariz., referring to traditional Navajo clothing. “In their 20s and 30s, everyone wears jeans and maybe miniskirts and so on.” Teenagers in Navajo country dress as teenagers do everywhere: the same lip rings, A & F logos and Crazy Color streaks. “That Navajo style, it’s probably the last generation that will do it,” Mr. Mitchell said, noting with a hint of optimism that graduation season is coming.Ceremonial occasions are a remaining stronghold of Navajo style in Navajo land. Whether for tribal gatherings, powwows or any event involving a diploma, even the young still make their way to cities like Gallup, N.M., to buy traditional moccasins, cowboy shirts with pearly snap buttons, blanket dresses and the hunks of silver and turquoise that are a Navajo version of a graduation-day watch.'"
"'12-03-15,'1','LONDON — After months of tortuous and tense negotiations, a second bailout for Greece finally became a reality on Wednesday when euro zone nations formally approved the plan and authorized the release of the first multibillion-euro loan installment.In a statement, Jean-Claude Juncker, who, as the president of the Eurogroup, leads the finance ministers of the 17 European Union members that use the euro, said the national governments had formally approved Greece’s second rescue, which is valued at 130 billion euros ($170 billion). “All required national and parliamentary procedures have been finalized,” he said.Finance ministers gave their political seal of approval to the accord earlier in the week, but the announcement on Wednesday signified the end of negotiations that had provoked tensions between Greece and some of its creditors and that periodically had teetered close to failure.A first installment of 39.4 billion euros ($51.4 billion) in loans will be disbursed from the euro zone’s temporary bailout fund, the European Financial Stability Facility.The board of the International Monetary Fund is scheduled to meet on Thursday and is expected to agree to contribute 28 billion euros ($37 billion) to the package.Greece will not be handed a blank check. The bailout loans will be paid in installments, and each tranche of aid will be conditional on the government in Athens hitting goals and completing structural changes to its economy, including the privatization of state-owned assets.'"
"'12-03-15,'1','Q. What’s the incentive for a small business’s customers to share a deal with their social network?A. The small business chooses the incentive. The reward might be an extra $5 discount on the coupon, or 20 percent off on a second visit, or a free item, or whatever the business wants to offer. But the biggest difference with SaveLocal is that the customer gets the reward just for sharing, whether or not the friends buy anything.Q. By offering smaller discounts, your merchants may protect per-customer profits, but won’t the deals be less compelling to consumers?A. We’re seeing success with discounts of less than half off. We haven’t tested it enough to know exactly at what point you get diminishing returns from decreasing the discount, but we’ve seen a customer be wildly successful with a 33 percent discount. A smaller discount might not attract as many customers, but it’s the rabid deal-seekers who are going to find it less appealing, and that’s not necessarily who small businesses want to attract.We’re changing the whole economics of the deal. The daily deal companies not only make merchants offer about half off, they keep about half of what the merchant takes in on the deal. We only charge $1 to $3 for each coupon. And we help our customers think through the best way to structure the deal. Restaurants can offer a coupon for less than the average ticket and make more when the customer buys up, so that if customers spend $40 on a dinner, the merchant can offer a $20 coupon for $10, and keep all of the extra $20 that the customer spends.Q. If your customers e-mail their offerings only to existing customers, are they giving up the opportunity to attract lots of new customers?A. About a fifth of the people responding to our deals are new customers for the merchant. But more important, because they’re getting the offer through an existing customer, they’re much more likely to be local than the people who respond to daily deals, and they’re much more likely to turn into loyal customers. They’re learning about the deal from an existing customer who’s endorsing the merchant. And we give merchants the means for following up, by helping the merchant get the new customer’s e-mail address and opt-in permission during the purchase process. Groupon and LivingSocial don’t share contact information with merchants.Q. Why can’t a small business send out its own coupons to its own mailing list? Why does it need you?A. We make it easier and help them structure and manage the deal. We handle the redemption, and we gather and analyze the data, so the merchant can understand the true R.O.I. of the deal based on how much customers spent and how much of it was discounted. And we make it ridiculously affordable.Q. How do you calculate the return on investment?A. We think about R.O.I. in two stages. First, the small business wants to know if it made money just on the purchases made by both existing and new customers when they use the coupons, and we track all that to tell our customers exactly how much was spent on the total purchase versus what the business spent on the promotion.Then we look at the longer-term R.O.I. by tracking how many new customers were brought in and whether they’re being turned into loyal repeat customers by collecting their e-mail addresses with permission for the small business to contact them. We’ll continue to track that longer-term R.O.I. and help our customers take advantage of it with e-mail campaigns.From the deals that have been done with SaveLocal so far, we’ve seen a good R.O.I. just on the first stage, and now we’re starting to see it on the second stage.[You can read about a business that tried SaveLocal and one that chose not to at nytimes.com/boss.]Q. Not all businesses have their customers’ e-mails. Can this work for a business that hasn’t been collecting e-mails?A. Certainly it wouldn’t be starting from as strong a point as a business that has the e-mail addresses, but yes, a small business can start off SaveLocal through sharing over a social network. We believe it’s important that every small business build that e-mail list, and these offers create a great incentive for customers to get on it.Q. How is your core business of e-mail-based marketing holding up? Is it being replaced by social-media marketing?A. We do help customers with social-network campaigns, but e-mail is still one of the fundamental channels of communication. Facebook just released the statistic that on average only 12 percent of the people that “like” a page see a new message from the page owner show up in their news feed. The typical small business only has about 100 people who like their page, which means a total of 12 people are seeing the message. The typical small business has more than 2,000 names on an e-mail list. It wouldn’t be smart to stop communicating to those 2,000 people in order to focus on the 100 people they might be able to reach on Facebook.'"
"'12-03-15,'1','Mr. Lively is the founder and president of Abiding Truth Ministries. He is also the author of “The Pink Swastika: Homosexuality in the Nazi Party,” which says that Nazism was a movement inspired by homosexuals, and “Seven Steps to Recruit-Proof Your Child,” a guide to prevent what he calls “pro-homosexual indoctrination.”He has traveled to Uganda, Latvia and Moldova to warn Christian clergy members to defend their countries against what he says is an onslaught by gay rights advocates based in the West.Pamela C. Spees, a lawyer for the Ugandan group, works with the Center for Constitutional Rights, a legal advocacy group based in New York City. Ms. Spees said that since gay men and lesbians in Uganda have little support, the suit “brings the fight” to those in the United States who she says fomented the anti-gay legislation in Uganda. She says that the suit is targeted at Mr. Lively’s actions, not his beliefs. “This is not just based on his speech,” she said. “It’s based on his conduct. Belief is one thing, but actively trying to harm and deprive other people of their rights is the definition of persecution.”Mr. Lively is one of many conservative American evangelicals who were active in Uganda. He and others tried to distance themselves from the legislation after the international outcry over the death penalty provision. Ms. Spees said the lawsuit singled him out because “his role was critical.”Mr. Lively posted a report after his visit to Uganda in 2009 describing how he addressed groups of lawyers, members of Parliament, universities, secondary schools and Christian leaders about “the ‘gay’ agenda,” and spoke at a three-day conference.Frank Mugisha, of Sexual Minorities Uganda, the plaintiff in the lawsuit, said Wednesday in a conference call that before these events in 2009, gay men and lesbians were “looked at as different,” but that “no one bothered them.”But after Mr. Lively’s speeches, Mr. Mugisha said, “People were being reported to the police as homosexuals, were thrown out by their families or thrown out by the church.”The lawsuit names four Ugandan co-conspirators: Stephen Langa and Martin Ssempa, evangelists active in the anti-gay movement; David Bahati, the legislator who sponsored the bill; and James Buturo, the former minister of ethics and a proponent of the legislation.Informed of the lawsuit against Mr. Lively, Mr. Buturo said Wednesday in an interview, “I don’t know that person at all.” Nevertheless, Mr. Lively said in his report that he had a half-hour meeting with Mr. Buturo in 2009.'"
"'12-03-15,'1','A Tibetan monk in his 30s, Jamyang Palden, set fire to himself on Wednesday in the town of Rongwo in the Chinese province of Qinghai to protest rule by China, according to Free Tibet, an advocacy group based in London.Jamyang Palden, who self-immolated in a square in front of Rongwo Monastery, is believed to have survived. The authorities took him to a hospital, but monks brought him back to the monastery for fear that he would be arrested, Free Tibet said.At least 27 Tibetans have self-immolated since March 2011, and at least 18 of those have died. About 500 monks gathered in the square after the self-immolation on Wednesday, and some held up pictures of the Dalai Lama, the exiled spiritual leader of the Tibetans, Free Tibet said.The International Campaign for Tibet, another advocacy group, said its sources had confirmed the self-immolation, which took place around 9 a.m. Rongwo is in the county of Rebkong, called Tongren in Chinese, an area that is on the border of the Tibetan and ethnic Han lands.'"
"'12-03-15,'1','As flowers and tributes piled up outside the shuttered ’t Stekske school, Bas van Dijk, 13, came to mourn. “I’d say we’re kind of angry with whoever was responsible for this crash,” he said. “I knew every single one of the victims.” Many, he said, were his soccer mates.There was mounting rage over the loss and the physical and psychological damage to survivors. How, wondered parents and teenagers, could a bus from a company with an apparently good safety record swerve out of control like that?“I’m asking myself, what are the drivers doing before they start out on their journeys?” said Jos Bode, 58. His 12-year-old granddaughter Jennifer was on the bus, he said, and he did not know whether she had survived. “Maybe it was not responsible of the tour operators to be driving at night,” he added.Both bus drivers perished in the crash, along with other adults: Frank van Kerckhove, a Dutch teacher who had set up a blog for the Heverlee children to keep in touch with parents at home; Raymond Theunis, 54, a sixth-grade teacher at ’t Stekske; and Veerle Vanheukelom, 38, a school administrator.“Everyone loved” Mr. Theunis, recalled a former student, Marie Vercauteren, 14. “He was a very good teacher.”Kris Verduyckt, deputy mayor of Lommel, who announced the death of the teacher and the administrator, said Wednesday evening that 6 of the 22 students from ’t Stekske had survived. The fate of the other 16 was not clear, he said.In some years, the ski party took the train, Bas said. Ms. Emmers wondered whether a bus was used this year because it was more direct and thus easier for children lugging heavy bags.Because Lommel-Kolonie is less than a mile from the Dutch border, 9 of the 22 children from ’t Stekske on the bus were Dutch citizens, and one was German. The rest were Belgian.“Here the education is so much better than in Holland, and the kids have to treat their teachers with respect,” said Luc Erken, 58, whose home is directly next to the school, in a tidy middle-class district dotted with antiques shops and small businesses. “Some Dutch people even moved here thinking that here they get better schools, and gardens, and generally a much nicer environment.”“Something really has gone forever with this tragedy,” said William van Dijk, 47, who lives opposite the school and has an 11-year-old daughter who goes there. Mr. van Dijk, who is Belgian, had already decided with his wife, who is Dutch, not to send his daughter on next year’s ski trip if it meant going by bus.Across Belgium, radio and television were full of commentary about whether the rules for bus trips were sufficiently rigorous. Parents told phone-in programs that they might now take a more active role in vetting drivers and bus companies and in planning such trips, long left to schools to organize. Current and former bus drivers took to the airwaves, insisting that they were among the most responsible drivers anywhere in the world and that their companies acted responsibly and should not be thought of as unscrupulous.In Heverlee, near the old university town of Leuven, residents mourned “Teacher Frank” and an unknown number of pupils lost out of 24 who had gone on the trip from the Sint-Lambertus school, a small Roman Catholic institution with about 200 pupils, The Associated Press reported.Entries from the blog the teacher had established included glowing mentions of a torchlight march, rides in a funicular railway, a sing-along and a dress-up casino evening, The A.P. said.The agency reported from Switzerland that even hardened rescue workers were stunned by the scene at the crash site.It was “a scene like a war,” the police chief in the canton of Valais, Christian Varone, told reporters. “We have had a number of serious accidents in Valais, but nothing like this, with so many young victims.”'"

"'12-03-15,'1','ISLAMABAD, Pakistan — A Swiss couple held by the Taliban in northwestern Pakistan for eight months turned up at a military checkpoint early on Thursday and were flown by helicopter to Peshawar and then Islamabad, where they were handed over to the Swiss Embassy, officials said.It was unclear how the two obtained their freedom. A Pakistani military spokesman, Maj. Gen. Athar Abbas, said they had escaped. But in a video released last week, another Taliban hostage, Ajmal Khan, the head of a university in Peshawar, said that the government had agreed to pay “millions of rupees” and to free 100 prisoners in exchange for the Swiss hostages.Kidnapping has become a major source of revenue and propaganda for the Pakistani Taliban and associated militant factions based in North and South Waziristan, the tribal agencies at the heart of militant operations that have borne the brunt of American drone strikes in recent years. Hostages captured by various groups around the country, or in Afghanistan, are often sold to the Taliban or Al Qaeda and transferred to the tribal belt.Along with high-profile kidnappings of foreigners, the Taliban have targeted dozens of wealthy and prominent Pakistanis, some of whom have spent years in captivity. On Thursday night, the local news media reported that Amir Malik, 41, a wealthy jeweler kidnapped from Lahore in August 2010, had been freed in Waziristan.Mr. Malik’s father-in-law, Gen. Tariq Majid, is a retired four-star general and former chairman of the military’s Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee. Overjoyed relatives said the army had promised to bring Mr. Malik home soon.'"

"'12-03-16,'0','WASHINGTON — For more than two years, a handful of Democrats on the Senate intelligence committee have warned that the government is secretly interpreting its surveillance powers under the Patriot Act in a way that would be alarming if the public — or even others in Congress — knew about it.On Thursday, two of those senators — Ron Wyden of Oregon and Mark Udall of Colorado — went further. They said a top-secret intelligence operation that is based on that secret legal theory is not as crucial to national security as executive branch officials have maintained.The senators, who also said that Americans would be “stunned” to know what the government thought the Patriot Act allowed it to do, made their remarks in a letter to Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. after a Justice Department official last month told a judge that disclosing anything about the program “could be expected to cause exceptionally grave damage to the national security of the United States.”The Justice Department has argued that disclosing information about its interpretation of the Patriot Act could alert adversaries to how the government collects certain intelligence. It is seeking the dismissal of two Freedom of Information Act lawsuits — by The New York Times and by the American Civil Liberties Union — related to how the Patriot Act has been interpreted.The senators wrote that it was appropriate to keep specific operations secret. But, they said, the government in a democracy must act within publicly understood law so that voters “can ratify or reject decisions made on their behalf” — even if that “obligation to be transparent with the public” creates other challenges.'"

"'12-03-16,'0','During Ms. Cruz’s testimony, prosecutors showed her a copy of Mr. Espada’s most recent salary contract, which included provisions that limited the daily allowance, or per diem, to travel expenses. Ms. Cruz read the contract aloud from the stand.“C.C.D.C. agrees that it will reimburse Espada for any and all necessary, customary and usual expenses incurred by him while traveling for and on behalf of C.C.D.C. or otherwise in the conduct of C.C.D.C. business,” she read. Soundview was originally incorporated as Comprehensive Community Development Corporation.Ms. Cruz read from a document that said, “Per diem will be paid when the travel period exceeds 10 hours in the same calendar day.”Mr. Espada, a Democrat and former Senate majority leader, is accused of spending more than $115,000 in personal charges using his corporate credit card.The government entered into evidence a copy of Mr. Espada’s most recent contract, which gave him an annual salary of $235,000, eight weeks of paid vacation and 30 sick days per year.Mr. Espada, along with his son, Pedro Gautier Espada, is also accused of subleasing business space that belonged to the health care network and directing the proceeds to a subsidiary that his family controlled.Ms. Cruz said she had seen checks that were made out to the subsidiaries rather than to the Soundview Health Care Network, which actually leased the property in the South Bronx.The government spent much of the morning outlining a web of nepotism that prosecutors said Mr. Espada controlled. Prosecutors placed a giant poster with Mr. Espada’s family tree on an easel in front of the jury box.Ms. Cruz went through the family person by person, pointing out more than a dozen of Mr. Espada’s family members and in-laws who served on the board of the health care network or held other leadership positions. Most had little experience relating to the job, including one relative who joined the board after working as a cook in a restaurant.Ms. Cruz said that Soundview had financial difficulties that became more severe over time, particularly in the last 8 to 10 years.“We were constantly running low on medical supplies,” she said. “The patients would come in to get their dentures and their dentures would not be there.”Under an immunity agreement, Ms. Cruz will not be prosecuted for her role in the Soundview operation in exchange for her testimony. In 2005, she was convicted of working on Mr. Espada’s political campaign for two weeks while still accepting a paycheck from Soundview. She was also convicted of assaulting a woman with a knife in 1991. Mr. Espada helped get her out of jail.'"
"'12-03-16,'0','“Making such a certification would undermine the brave struggle of the Egyptian people for a society founded on respect for human rights and the rule of law,” Adotei Akwei of Amnesty International USA wrote in a letter to Mrs. Clinton released on Thursday. “Waiving the certification requirement would forfeit a key form of pressure for the advancement of human rights.”The State Department’s spokeswoman, Victoria Nuland, said a final decision had not yet been made over resuming the aid, but other officials said there was still a question over how to write the waiver.President Obama, Mrs. Clinton and other senior officials explicitly warned Egypt’s military leaders that the aid this year was at risk because of the prosecution of the American-financed organizations, which include Freedom House, the International Republican Institute and the National Democratic Institute. The case, which began in December, continues, though Egyptian authorities, under intense pressure from the administration, lifted a travel ban on the seven American employees of the groups. The individuals were allowed to depart after the groups paid nearly $4 million in bail.One administration official said that with the prosecution still under way, it was impossible for Mrs. Clinton to certify Egypt under the new law, which says that its leaders must carry out “policies to protect freedom of expression, association and religion, and due process of law.” At the same time, Egypt has seated a new Parliament in elections widely seen as free and fair, and it has scheduled a presidential election in May, with a runoff to follow in June. In addition, officials said they believed the aid was crucial to maintain close cooperation with Egypt’s military on regional security and counterterrorism.Besides the military assistance, the United States has budgeted $250 million for economic and political programs, including those targeted by the Egyptian courts. It has also proposed continuing military aid next year and creating a new $770 million fund to support economic development across North Africa.Only the military assistance is tied to the certification on basic freedoms, though all assistance to Egypt requires the State Department to certify that the country continues to honor the Camp David peace treaties with Israel. The administration succeeded in including the waiver authority in the new law, giving Mrs. Clinton flexibility to allow some aid, without a blanket waiver.Within the administration, some officials have argued that the certification should wait until the presidential election, but Egypt’s military has exhausted previously authorized aid and has received no new American funds since the current fiscal year began in October.Within weeks Egypt risks missing payments on defense contracts, largely with American arms manufacturers, forcing Mrs. Clinton to decide the certification question now. “It’s coming up sooner than some people wanted,” one senior official said.The pressure the administration put on Egyptian authorities to resolve the fate of the Americans working for nongovernment organizations provoked an angry reaction in Cairo. After the Americans were released and six of them left the country, the new Parliament, in a symbolic action, debated rejecting American aid outright, and questioned relations with Israel.In Washington, such moves have heightened concerns, especially among lawmakers who imposed the conditions on aid. “The Parliament has said some things that are very chilling,” Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, said at a budget hearing this week. “We’re not going to throw good money after bad,” he added.Many in Congress, though, share the administration’s wariness off cutting off assistance altogether. “The strength of Egypt, its stability, is important to the region and to the world,” the House Democratic leader, Nancy Pelosi, said on Thursday during a visit to Cairo with a delegation of lawmakers, “and we want to be helpful in that regard.”But Tom Malinowski, director of the Washington office of Human Rights Watch, said the administration needed to rethink assistance to Egypt after decades of focusing it largely on the military.“There’s a much bigger question here,” he said, “and that is: if we want to help a post-Mubarak Egypt, does the current aid package make the slightest bit of sense?”'"
"'12-03-16,'0','For the last few weeks and months, Raymond W. Kelly, the police commissioner of New York, had taken his lumps over various issues, from his department’s handling of Occupy Wall Street to its surveillance practices and its reliance on stop-and-frisk tactics. And with his scheduled appearance before the City Council on Thursday, more of the same was expected.But as the session began, it became evident that Mr. Kelly was not going to take it anymore.The defensive scowl etched into Mr. Kelly’s face dropped away as he suggested that the Council was notably at a loss to offer ideas — any ideas at all — for how to stop violence among young minority men.“What I haven’t heard is any solution to the violence problems in these communities — people are upset about being stopped, yet what is the answer?” Mr. Kelly asked Councilwoman Melissa Mark-Viverito, who had been asking the commissioner to acknowledge that the department’s practice of street stops in minority communities left many people “feeling under siege.”“What have you said about how do we stop this violence?” Mr. Kelly asked, asserting that violence among minority youth is “something that the government has an obligation to try to solve.”Ms. Mark-Viverito, whose district includes East Harlem and part of the South Bronx, was now pressed for an answer.'"
"'12-03-16,'0','“This kind of thing just happens any time a platform is successful,” said David Edery, chief executive of Spry Fox, a small software company that sells games in the App Store. “People start flooding into it and it starts to get crazy.”The App Store offers more than 600,000 applications for iPhones, iPads and Touches, and has already generated billions in revenue for Apple and its developers. That makes it both the best deal going for software makers and consumers, and also a hulking target for those looking to manipulate the system and cheat people.Apple declined a request for an interview, but said in a statement that it was working to enhance security. It advised customers whose payment information had been stolen to change their iTunes passwords and to contact their financial institutions.In the shadowy world of hacking, it’s often unclear how criminals get iTunes passwords or credit card information. But the App Store, and Apple’s broader iTunes Store, have become playgrounds for illicit transactions. And the Web is rife with App Store scams. On Chinese online marketplaces, like Taobao or DHgate, some sellers are offering access to iTunes accounts for as little as $33. One seller on DHgate, for instance, has sold 56 iTunes accounts for less than $35 each, promising thousands of dollars in “ .”There are services that claim to generate codes for iTunes gift cards, and forums that explain how to use prepaid Visa cards to get free App Store purchases.The scale of the problem is difficult to gauge without Apple’s cooperation, though there is widespread anecdotal evidence, even on Apple’s own site. On one Apple support forum, a thread titled “iTunes store account hacked,” there are some 1,370 replies, starting in November 2010 and extending to Thursday. Last week, more than 100 people on who said they were iTunes users complained about stolen funds.Last month, Daniel Saewitz, a 20-year-old student, was charged $81 for purchases related to a Chinese iPhone game. He alerted Apple and changed his iTunes password. But 24 hours later, he said, his account was hacked again. In an e-mail, Apple said it was refunding Mr. Saewitz’s money, but added that it was making an exception to its usual rules.For developers, the scams can cause big headaches, eating up resources and damaging their reputations. Several game makers in , where many of the hacks appear to originate, said they had lost hundreds of thousands of dollars because of fraud.Hoolai Game, a -based developer that introduced an iPhone app last year, looked at its monthly payments from Apple and found that they were roughly 20 to 50 percent less than the sum of the daily reports it gets from the company. Hoolai and others say they believe these missing payments are fraudulent transactions that are wiped out by Apple.More troubling for developers is that consumers whose accounts have been improperly charged often blame the game makers. The reviews in the App Store for Kingdom Conquest, from the Japanese game giant Sega, include dozens from incensed users who accuse Sega of robbing them. Sega, which first noticed a burst of fraudulent transactions last summer, is still working on the problem, according to Ben Harborne, a brand manager at the company.“We are very worried about reputation,” said Jian Huang, the president of Hoolai, who hopes to introduce a game in the later this year. “We have no way to tell the customer that we’re victims too.”One successful American game developer, who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of retribution by Apple, said he started to notice discrepancies in payments last summer. The developer said his team had sent multiple e-mails to Apple, but that it had not addressed whether the missing payments were a result of fraud. Over the last year, the gap has amounted to millions of dollars, according to internal documents provided by the developer.With little action from Apple, some affected developers have banded together. One Chinese developer, CocoaChina, has created an antifraud alliance of roughly a dozen developers.While many of the affected consumers and developers said they did not blame Apple for their misfortunes, nearly all said the company could be more responsive, and noted that it lacked even a dedicated phone line to deal with complaints.“Apple wants to pretend that everything is magic,” said Alex Stamos, co-founder of iSEC Partners, a security firm. “They need to admit that their products can be used by bad people to do bad things.”One problem, Mr. Stamos said, is that iTunes customers use a single account and password to access all Apple services. For example, the same login can be used to download a $1 game or buy a $2,000 laptop through the Apple Store app. He said that Apple could adopt a two-step verification method like ’s. For example, if a user wanted to log in to the iTunes store on a new device, Apple could send a message to his iPhone containing a code, which he would enter to verify his identity.Some App Store problems are the fault of the developers themselves — including those who make it harder for consumers to trust the store by cheating the system. The easiest ways to find new apps are Apple’s Top 25 lists for different categories, including “most downloaded.” But some of those downloads may not be generated by real people.Walter , an independent programmer, said he was disheartened by a phone call from a service that offered to put his game in the Top 25. He said the promoter, whom he declined to name so as not to attract clients to the service, had hired someone to build an army of software “bots” that automatically download apps and drive up their rankings. The company wanted $5,000 for this service, said Mr. Kaman, who declined.Mr. Edery of Spry Fox said his company was approached in October by a firm called GTekna, which offered to push its apps into the Top 25 for $10,000. Chang-Min Pak, GTekna’s chief executive, said in an interview this week that it stopped offering such a service because Apple reminded developers in February that it was not allowed.Then there are the customers who have been tricked into downloading apps that are not what they seem to be. Apple has strict guidelines for developers, and it has tools and human reviewers to screen apps. But bad ones do slip through. One $2 app, for example, promises extra virtual coins for people playing the game DragonVale. But when customers download the app, no coins appear. The app has received dozens of one-star reviews from customers complaining that it is a scam and should be removed.John Casasanta, owner of the iPhone app studio Tap Tap Tap, said the issue of developers manipulating the App Store remained largely unaddressed. “Apple has been doing the barest minimum to keep these things under control, because from their perspective, there’s simply not a problem,” Mr. Casasanta said.'"
"'12-03-16,'0','The three-week Paul Taylor season at the David H. Koch Theater piles on new repertory with staggering abundance. It remains true that the season demonstrates Mr. Taylor’s centrality to the tradition of American modern dance, and that it makes his choreography look impressively different by placing it in the context of a tall, deep and broad opera house. It is also true that its profusion of works old and new must make us rethink both Mr. Taylor’s history and that of modern dance. People watching his choreography for the first time this week have spoken of their immediate enthusiasm for his work; long-term aficionados have rejoiced both to recognize and to reconsider what they knew and loved. There are, however, problems.But then Mr. Taylor loves problem and paradox. Wednesday’s performance introduced the New York premiere of “The Uncommitted,” set to music by Arvo Pärt. I assume that Mr. Taylor knows perfectly well that Mr. Pärt’s music — which Mark Morris has recently, and quite fairly, called dance resistant — has become a cliché of modern choreography, adding nebulous atmosphere without dance. Provocatively “The Uncommitted” even opens with one of the most familiar Pärt pieces, “Fratres.”What “The Uncommitted” seems to address is the enigmatic nature of Mr. Pärt’s music. Mr. Taylor takes this composer seriously; after “Fratres” he goes on to three much less known pieces: “Mozart-Adagio,” “Ricercar” and “Summa.” Santo Loquasto’s designs suggest deliberately unclear and fractured views of various dark landscapes. It’s an ensemble piece; the cast of characters keeps changing. What doesn’t change is the sense that each individual here, often just viewed for a few seconds, is afflicted by some unresolved dilemma.A man gestures and changes direction as if looking for help from outside, a woman moves slowly as if in doubt and hesitation, another man keeps contradicting himself in successive physical impulses, another woman seems wracked by need; every dancer has a solo moment. One woman hurls herself at a man, but even this potent stroke of drama becomes just a symptom here of a general human condition. You can’t get caught up in any one situation; Mr. Taylor’s focus keeps moving. But you can’t miss the sense of a pervading malaise.On a first viewing what impresses me most in “The Uncommitted” is Mr. Taylor’s sheer mastery of stagecraft. The choreography for “Fratres” features a succession of solos, but better yet is the way Mr. Taylor wipes the stage after each one, bringing on a different ensemble to absorb the last soloist and deposit the next one. Remarkably, this too fits right in with the spare, haunting sound world of Mr. Pärt’s music.On Wednesday “The Uncommitted” occurred as the centerpiece of a triple bill, between two of the Taylor works I have come to love the most, “Cloven Kingdom” (1976) and “Beloved Renegade” (2008). Both are quintessential Taylor studies in paradox, but at this performance the main revelation was simply the basic pleasure of Mr. Taylor’s dance movement. When it comes to individuals, his phrasing is so rich with contrasts; when it comes to groups, his sense of patterning constantly renews itself with fresh ideas.'"
"'12-03-16,'0','Kansas State Coach Frank Martin had spoken at length about Rodriguez a day earlier, joking that he has increased his gray hairs. Still, Martin said, he understands the risks of having a freshman handling the responsibility of starting at point guard but is willing to take the good with the bad.Eustachy said Rodriguez “murdered” the Golden Eagles, but there was no denying the freshman’s ups and downs: he committed a sloppy turnover with just over two minutes remaining that led to Darnell Dodson’s dunk and cut the Kansas State lead to 3, only to come back on the next possession with an acrobatic twisting drive and lay-up that pushed the advantage back to 5.“You either have trust in someone or you don’t,” Martin said. “It’s not like I trust him today, don’t trust him tomorrow. It’s not like I trust him with 10 minutes to go and not trust him with two minutes to go.”Southern Miss was led by point guard Neil Watson, who scored 16 points and had 4 assists but also recorded 5 turnovers. Guard LaShay Page played all 40 minutes and scored 15 points, while Dodson contributed 14 and grabbed 10 rebounds.The Golden Eagles were hurt by long stretches of futility: they started the game by making 1 of their first 10 shots and 5 of their first 20. Then, after opening the second half on a run, they finished poorly, making only 6 of their final 20 shots.Eustachy said Henriquez played a significant role in limiting the Southern Mississippi offense. Henriquez, a junior from Port Chester, N.Y., who is 6 feet 11, was a presence under the rim throughout the game and left Eustachy bemoaning the points Southern Miss lost on blocked lay-ups.“When you’re going to the rim, he really changes the game,” Eustachy said. He then noted that Henriquez had six blocks and said: “That’s 12 points. I’m not sure what we lost by, but that’s 12 points. McGruder is a great talent, but Henriquez is as important to that team as McGruder.”Despite his typically animated showing during the game — he and Martin are both famous screamers — Eustachy was contemplative afterward.“This is as special as it gets — you’re talking about the Super Bowl, you talk about the World Series,” he said. “We fought hard to try to win. I knew once I got out on the court all that stuff would go away and I’d be myself. But leading into it, it was just neat to be in the process.”'"
"'12-03-16,'0','MOSCOW — In a move seemingly taken from a Soviet dictator’s handbook, the government of Belarus has apparently started barring opponents of President Aleksandr G. Lukashenko from leaving the former Soviet republic.Over the last week, at least 10 journalists, opposition political figures and human rights workers have been either prevented from crossing the country’s border with the European Union or informed that they are no longer permitted to leave Belarus.Though the authorities have offered no explanation, the travel bans appear to be a response to new sanctions imposed by the European Union last month on Mr. Lukashenko’s government. Among other measures, the sanctions prevent top officials from entering the European Union.On Thursday, border guards refused to allow two independent journalists to travel to Poland to attend a conference of Belarussian non-governmental organizations. One of them, Mikhail Yanchuk, the head of the country’s only independent television station, said he was kicked off a train at the Polish border without explanation and given a stamp in his passport that will prevent him from leaving in the future. His colleague, Zhanna Litvina, the head of the Belarussian Association of Journalists, was stopped from boarding a flight.“This fits in with other methods employed in the fight against civil society over the last 17 years, but it is certainly a new one,” Mr. Yanchuk said by telephone. “It is being carried out to make our lives just a little more difficult.”'"
"'12-03-16,'0','“I did not know about, nor did I try to hide, wrongdoing,” he said. “I do not believe the evidence before you supports any other conclusion.”Mr. Thurlbeck’s arrest on Wednesday was his second in Scotland Yard’s investigations. His arrest in April, the police said, was on suspicion of phone hacking.More than 40 people with links to the Murdoch papers have been arrested and released on bail in the scandal, including six who were taken for lengthy questioning on Tuesday on suspicion of obstruction of justice. The six included Rebekah Brooks, a former editor of The News of the World and former chief executive of News International; her husband, Charlie Brooks, a well-known racehorse trainer; and Mark Hanna, the head of security at News International.Legal experts said the arrests in recent weeks pointed to an ascending hierarchy of suspected wrongdoing that made for a worsening situation for News International and its parent, News Corporation. After concentrating for months on phone hacking, Scotland Yard has progressed to allegations that carry potentially far heavier criminal penalties — bribery of public officials, obstruction of justice and now witness intimidation.One of the problems facing the company is the bitter disaffection of some who lost their jobs as a result of the News of the World shutdown or who, like Mr. Thurlbeck, were dismissed. In that regard, Mr. Thurlbeck has become a focal figure, suing the company for his legal costs and using a blog on his own Web site to excoriate News International executives for passing information to Scotland Yard that led to some of the recent arrests.He has made a target of News Corporation’s Management and Standards Committee, appointed by Rupert Murdoch to track down evidence of wrongdoing from the company’s files and turn it over to the police, and to draw up new ethical rules for the company’s journalism.In one post last week, Mr. Thurlbeck described the committee as “obsequious,” and said that it was “busily heaping the corpses of its most loyal servants onto a funeral pyre” in the hope of deterring any prosecution of News Corporation in the United States under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.One News Corporation executive who has been singled out by Mr. Thurlbeck for harsh comments has been Will Lewis, the 42-year-old former executive editor of the group that publishes The Daily Telegraph and the Sunday Telegraph, who was recruited by News International in 2010, and, as a News Corporation executive, plays a leading role in the Management and Standards Committee.In another post last week, Mr. Thurlbeck reported that Mr. Lewis had hired a private security company to tighten surveillance of his home outside London after The Evening Standard, a non-Murdoch tabloid in London, ran a story saying that two Sun journalists had attempted suicide after the Murdoch committee turned their names over to the police. Mr. Thurlbeck said Mr. Lewis had acted on his home security in the face of “mounting fury on the Sun’s newsroom floor.”In its original form, the Thurlbeck post gave the street address of Mr. Lewis’s home, a detail he subsequently struck from the blog, with an apology.'"
"'12-03-16,'0','Economic growth showed signs of becoming more robust as the number of Americans claiming new jobless benefits fell to a four-year low last week and manufacturing activity in the Northeast picked up this month, according to reports released Thursday.But the effect of higher oil prices was also starting to be seen. Producer prices racked up their biggest increase in five months in February, while manufacturers in New York State reported a surge in input costs in March.The recent gains in oil and gasoline prices have raised concerns that the higher costs could start to squeeze businesses and consumers and slow the recovery.Still, producer prices last month did not rise as much as economists had expected, and underlying inflation pressures were contained.Thursday’s initial claims data for state unemployment benefits was further evidence of an improving labor market after the jobless rate held at a three-year low of 8.3 percent in February.“This suggests that the recovery is firmly on track,” said Scott Brown, chief economist at Raymond James in St. Petersburg, Florida.'"
"'12-03-16,'0','ISLAMABAD, Pakistan — A Swiss couple held by the Taliban in northwestern Pakistan for eight months turned up at a military checkpoint early on Thursday and were flown by helicopter to Peshawar and then Islamabad, where they were handed over to the Swiss Embassy, officials said.It was unclear how the two obtained their freedom. A Pakistani military spokesman, Maj. Gen. Athar Abbas, said they had escaped. But in a video released last week, another Taliban hostage, Ajmal Khan, the head of a university in Peshawar, said that the government had agreed to pay “millions of rupees” and to free 100 prisoners in exchange for the Swiss hostages.Kidnapping has become a major source of revenue and propaganda for the Pakistani Taliban and associated militant factions based in North and South Waziristan, the tribal agencies at the heart of militant operations that have borne the brunt of American drone strikes in recent years. Hostages captured by various groups around the country, or in Afghanistan, are often sold to the Taliban or Al Qaeda and transferred to the tribal belt.Along with high-profile kidnappings of foreigners, the Taliban have targeted dozens of wealthy and prominent Pakistanis, some of whom have spent years in captivity. On Thursday night, the local news media reported that Amir Malik, 41, a wealthy jeweler kidnapped from Lahore in August 2010, had been freed in Waziristan.Mr. Malik’s father-in-law, Gen. Tariq Majid, is a retired four-star general and former chairman of the military’s Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee. Overjoyed relatives said the army had promised to bring Mr. Malik home soon.'"

"'12-03-17,'0','After obtaining her doctorate with a dissertation titled “Beauty as Treated in Persian Literature,” she married the leftist writer and social critic Jalal Al-e Ahmad. He shared her outrage at the power that foreigners had come to exercise in Iran, and is said to have coined the term “gharbzadegi,” sometimes translated as “westoxification.” Nationalists used it to describe the extent to which Iran had fallen victim to foreign power.During a two-year Fulbright fellowship at Stanford University, Ms. Daneshvar studied under the writer Wallace Stegner, who later visited her in Tehran. Afterward she returned to Iran and taught art history at Tehran University. Pressure from the government of Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi, which saw her as potentially dangerous, prevented her from being granted a full professorship.In the 1950s and ’60s, Ms. Daneshvar became known as a translator of Chekhov, Shaw, Hawthorne, Schnitzler, Saroyan and other writers. She also published short stories, including several that focused on the oppression of Iranian women. Until the publication of “Savushun” in 1969, however, she was generally assumed to be living under her husband’s literary shadow. No one ever thought of her that way again.“Despite the fact that she lived with a massively egotistical public intellectual and in a deeply patriarchal society, Simin Daneshvar emerged as a luminary figure of the Persian literary scene entirely of her own making,” the Columbia University scholar Hamid Dabashi wrote. “She outlived Al-e Ahmad by more than four decades, and she will outlast him for an eternity.”“Savushun” — the title refers to a Persian mourning ceremony, and some editions translated it as “A Persian Requiem” — revolutionized Iranian literature and helped change the way Iranians viewed themselves, from a defeated people to an independent, self-respecting one. For the generation that came of age in the 1970s — and gave birth to the revolution that convulsed their country at the end of that decade — Ms. Daneshvar was the indispensible literary inspiration.“They killed my husband unjustly,” the heroine tells the police during a climactic funeral procession, after the husband had been assassinated under murky circumstances. “The least that can be done is to mourn him. Mourning is not forbidden, you know. During his life, we were always afraid and tried to make him afraid. Now that he is dead, what are we afraid of any more?”Ms. Daneshvar’s novel was the most widely read Iranian book of its era. It is a linear story, told from a woman’s point of view, set against a widely shared and deeply painful episode of foreign intervention. Its characters deal with a range of emotions as the plot unfolds through marriage, childbirth, adultery, poverty, loneliness, political defiance and death.Some critics believe that although “Savushun” strikes a rich chord in Iranian hearts, it is less durable as literature than avant-garde novels like “The Blind Owl,” a dazzlingly modern work of violent fantasy by Ms. Daneshvar’s contemporary, Sadegh Hedayat. Her book, however, was far more widely read in Iran.“Simple people have much to offer,” Ms. Daneshvar once asserted. “We, too, in return, must give to them to the best of our abilities. We must, with all our heart, try to help them acquire what they truly deserve.”During the decades of Islamic rule over her country, Ms. Daneshvar continued to write. She had no children.“ ‘Savushun’ will probably not make it to the best-seller list for reasons that are not far to seek,” a reviewer for Middle East Journal wrote after her masterpiece was published in English. “In a culture where it takes a devastating war to bring an area of the world to public attention, only to watch it recede into oblivion after a few days of relative calm and quiet, there is not much hope for a single book to make an impression, whatever the effort to enable it to communicate its message to American readers.”'"

"'12-03-17,'0','The Yankees understand the folly of sentimental decisions. When they need to be bloodless, they can. Ask Bernie Williams and Jorge Posada, who gathered their championship rings and went home when the Yankees decided they were no longer useful.With Andy Pettitte, it is different. The Yankees welcomed back Pettitte on Thursday with a one-year, $2.5 million minor league contract. It is a much more reasonable deal than the staggering $28 million (prorated) salary they gave Roger Clemens in May 2007. But these Yankees have much less of a need.When Clemens returned, the Yankees were drowning. They were below .500, five and a half games out of first place, giving starts to Kei Igawa and every fringy Class AAA starter they could find. They needed a savior, and Clemens needed one last payday before the Mitchell Report came out.Circumstances now are not so dire. The Yankees have six starters, with C. C. Sabathia, Hiroki Kuroda, Ivan Nova, Michael Pineda, Phil Hughes and Freddy Garcia. When Pettitte is ready, that makes seven for five spots.In a way, the Yankees had to do this. If Andy Pettitte wants to pitch, you let him pitch. He is only 39 years old — five years younger than Clemens was in 2007 — and in his last season, 2010, he was very good: 11-3 with a 3.28 earned run average in 21 starts, plus two more strong efforts in October.'"

"'12-03-17,'0','But there is surprisingly little evidence that gas prices deserve an outsize reputation for economic and political influence.Studies suggest that most voters agree with Ms. Hawks: they are angry about gas prices, but other factors, like the economy and the personal qualities of candidates, ultimately determine their votes.Gas prices influence voters indirectly, because rising prices can slow the pace of growth. But the influence is modest, because spending on oil and its derivatives makes up only a small part of the nation’s economic activity. Gas purchases account for less than 4 percent of household spending. Prices would need to increase by at least 28 percent to lift that share by a single percentage point. So far this year, they have jumped by 15 percent.“Presidential elections are based on evaluations of presidential performance and on the performance of the economy. You can’t reduce that to one small issue,” said Alan Abramowitz, a professor of political science at Emory University. “Are gas prices part of the equation that people think about? They probably are, but only a small piece.”Rising gas prices also make Americans less confident in the nation’s economic prospects and less approving of political leaders, according to public opinion surveys. But these, too, are small effects. One study by a political scientist estimated that the impact of changes in unemployment was 27 times greater than the impact of equivalent changes in gas prices.In part, the difference is that Americans are divided as to whether politicians should be held responsible.Donald J. Wheeler, a ball bearing tester from Springfield, Ohio, said people blamed the president because it was the easiest thing to do. “It’s ridiculous,” he said. “In my opinion, it’s the companies that are gouging people.”Brian Gregory, who delivers auto parts in northern Virginia, spends about $60 most weekdays filling his station wagon. He said that he blamed Mr. Obama for failing to control prices and that the issue was a major reason he planned to vote “either for a Republican or not at all.”“I don’t understand health care as well as I should,” he said. “Housing, I’m kind of vague on that. But this I can definitely understand.”Gas prices exert an unrivaled hold on the public imagination. Americans spend more on gas than on almost any other single good, and the exact amount is hard to miss as the numbers spin by on the pump. It hurts to watch, but there is also little choice. People can substitute chicken for steak, but they still need to drive the same distance to work.When prices rise, people wait to buy cars; they travel less; they buy fewer lottery tickets and spend less on child care, according to a study by Paul Edelstein and Lutz Kilian, economics professors at the University of Michigan.Michael Wills has stopped driving weekly from his home in Fairfax, Va., to his father’s home in North Beach, Md., a distance of 50 miles. Mr. Wills, 56, said he had seen his father only a few times in recent months.Amy Rivera, 24, of Orlando, said she shorted her electric bill last month to make sure she had enough money for gas.And Pat Rosenbeck, 57, a restaurant owner from Franklin, Ohio, said the flow of customers had slowed as gas climbed above $3 a gallon.The impact on happiness is even larger than the changes in spending, according to a 2010 study by researchers at the Brookings Institution, in part because people do not like uncertainty, and they do not know how high prices will climb.Republican primary voters overwhelmingly cite gas prices as an important issue. But voters’ views of a president are influenced by a wide range of issues.Rising gas prices sometimes track declines in presidential approval ratings. Gallup reported that President George W. Bush’s ratings fell to 48 percent at the end of October 2004, just before Election Day, from 60 percent in January. The price of a gallon of regular gas climbed 27 percent over the same period.But gas prices often move out of sync with approval ratings, too. President Bill Clinton’s ratings rose to 54 percent just before Election Day from 42 percent in early January 1996, even as the price of gas climbed 13 percent.Since 1976, a 30-cent increase in gas prices over a three-month period has corresponded to a reduction of two percentage points in a president’s approval rating if other economic factors are held constant, according to an analysis by John Sides, a professor of political science at George Washington University.That kind of movement has not been sufficient to affect the outcome of a presidential election, he said. “I think of the information flow that takes place during a presidential campaign as a big, wide Mississippi River, and gas prices are a tributary that flows into that river,” Professor Sides said. “It’s hard for one number, even if it’s staring you in the face while you’re pumping gas, to burn through all the other information that’s out there about the economy and the candidate.”A key implication, however, is that gas prices could make a difference if the movements were large enough and the race was close enough.A 2011 study of the impact of economic conditions on regional voting patterns found that the spike in gas prices in the summer of 2008 did give a small boost to Mr. Obama. Independent voters in areas where prices climbed highest reported a significantly more negative view of the health of the economy and were less likely to vote for incumbents.James Gimpel, a professor of government and politics at the University of Maryland who was a co-author of the study, said the increased volatility of gas prices was raising its importance in elections. “It may well be that this is an emerging factor that we’ll have to consider,” he said. “But if I can rely on that old social sciences copout, we need more evidence.”'"
"'12-03-17,'0','There is no way to determine exactly how many consumer satisfaction surveys are completed each year, but Mindshare Technologies, a small company that conducts and analyzes on-the-spot electronic surveys, says it completes 175,000 surveys every day, or more than 60 million annually.ForeSee, an offshoot of the American Customer Satisfaction Index in Ann Arbor, Mich., a company that measures consumer sentiment about business and government, says it collected 15 million surveys in 2011.Consumer patience may be fraying under the onslaught. The constant nagging has led to a condition known as survey fatigue and declining response rates over the last decade.“The frequent requests to fill out these surveys, especially with no incentives, have been so annoying that people just stop doing it,” said Richard L. Oliver, a professor of management at Vanderbilt University and the author of the textbook “Satisfaction: A Behavioral Perspective on the Consumer” (McGraw Hill, 1996). “In the old days, you felt as though you had been selected to represent the community, or even the nation. But this is the information age, and people know their information is worth something.”If customers balk at taking what can feel like an SAT test, the fault may lie with the surveys themselves. Many businesses, often against the advice of the experts they have hired to construct their questionnaires, cannot resist the urge to ask, ask and ask yet again. Exasperated consumers, assured that the survey will take only five minutes to complete, often bail out as they approach the 10-minute mark.Kimberly Nasief, the owner of Measure Consumer Perspectives, a company that sends mystery shoppers into stores, fills out customer satisfaction surveys out of professional interest. She recently wrote a screed on her blog, Service Witch, about the excessive length and lack of focus in most online surveys.“The one that broke my back was a survey for Babies ‘R’ Us,” she said in an interview. “I wrote a blog entry, ‘Infant Who Begins Babies “R” Us Customer Satisfaction Survey Dies of Old Age.’ ”In an act of revenge, she has posted videos on YouTube showing the painful process of filling out her least favorite surveys, from Walmart, Wendy’s, Continental Airlines, and Jo-Ann Fabric and Craft Stores — this last is an epic requiring two videos.To counter survey fatigue, companies are pressing consumers with renewed urgency. On their register receipts, stores like Walmart, Petco and Rite Aid include a Web address and an invitation to fill out a survey, with the chance to win a prize. At Staples, the prize is a $5,000 store card.In the auto industry, which tries to measure customer satisfaction at every possible stage, from the first tentative Web search to the last service visit, the assessment ritual can become a kind of performance.Sales representatives have been known to show pictures of their wives and children as they plead for a favorable review in their dealership’s satisfaction survey. Some show their customers a sample survey already ticked off with top marks in every rating category. Dealers sometimes throw in a free tank of gas or a free oil change as a quid pro quo.Pressure tactics have crept into other industries as well. Cable technicians, after completing an installation or repair, often call into the head office to report and then hand their cellphone over to the customer for a quick round of questioning about the service, an awkward conversation with the technician standing a few feet away.Sales clerks who once concluded a transaction with “Have a nice day” now plead with customers to fill out surveys and award good marks because “my job depends on it.”For beleaguered consumers, the forecast looks grim: more questionnaires. Although businesses now harvest a wealth of information on social media and opinion sites like Yelp and TripAdvisor, they are unlikely to abandon the customer satisfaction surveys, for at least two reasons.“From social media you can gauge sentiment and to a lesser extent underlying emotional content,” said Leonard Murphy, who writes for the marketing blog GreenBook. “But you won’t be able to determine why the customer feels that way. A survey gives you the opportunity to dig deeper.”Traditional surveys are also deeply embedded in the salary and bonus structures of big companies, which have accumulated decades’ worth of information and statistics that analysts use for year-to-year comparisons.There may be a third powerful force that will keep the consumer survey alive — the cult of the personal opinion and information exchange that Internet culture has nourished among younger Americans.“Young people send and receive communications at a rate we’ve never seen before,” said Claes G. Fornell, founder of the American Customer Satisfaction Index and a professor at the Stephen M. Ross School of Business at the University of Michigan.“They don’t seem to mind answering surveys if they’re not too long,” he added. “When you think about it, the whole concept of social media is, I’m going to give my opinion whether I’m asked or not.”'"
"'12-03-17,'0','In Brunswick, where Republicans decided to hold their caucuses two days early, the first question of the evening was whether to bind delegates to results of the primary. The measure passed by a wide margin and with no discussion, sending four delegates on behalf of Mr. Santorum and none for Mr. Romney or Representative Ron Paul of Texas, to the district convention in April and to the state convention in June.“All of our county delegates will be bound to the popular vote for Chariton County,” said Andrea Rice, the county Republican chairwoman, who presided over the meeting and reminded caucusgoers that Mr. Santorum had carried the county by 58 percent.A handful of people wearing shirts for Mr. Paul did not openly object, but chatted quietly among themselves and voted against the measure to bind the delegates. No one challenged the proposal on behalf of the Romney campaign, but Ms. Rice said a local Romney supporter was in the room.A spokesman for the Missouri Republican Party said that all counties had the option to use Mr. Santorum’s victory in the primary as a starting point in their selection of delegates if they chose. The Romney campaign said that it would push back against using the primary result, but there was no such rebuttal offered here in Brunswick, where a reporter dropped by unannounced.Mr. Santorum, who visited Missouri on Friday and is set to be on hand at two caucus locations on Saturday morning, is making a robust effort to win the majority of the state’s 52 delegates. It is part of the campaign’s county-by-county strategy to try to outflank Mr. Romney and catch him in the delegate race.The proceedings on the second floor of the Railyard Steakhouse drew 33 Republicans, all of whom were asked to present their driver’s licenses as they signed their names in a show of support for a voter identification law in the state.Mr. Santorum’s strength became clear in conversations with voters as they sliced their prime rib and grilled pork chops at a dinner that preceded the caucus. There were signs or banners for Santorum — or for any of his rivals — but several people said that he was the strongest conservative in the race.“I like his values. He’s one of us,” said Duane Leimkuehler, 53, a farmer of corn, wheat and soybeans. He was elected as a delegate and said that he would represent his county proudly at the district and state conventions, He also said he was focused on defeating President Obama and eager for the Republican race to conclude.“Mitt Romney is not my first choice. He’s getting support solely because he’s the front-runner,” Mr. Leimkuehler said. “But we’ve got to unite at some point.”The outcome of the caucus here was not necessarily representative of the gatherings to be held on Saturday.The Romney campaign is concentrated on finding its base of support in suburban St. Louis and Kansas City, where the candidate visited earlier in the week.In Brunswick, Harry Deweese, a construction company owner who was elected as a delegate, arrived wearing a white Ron Paul Revolution T-shirt. Before the business meeting began, his wife whispered to him, and he walked downstairs. He returned a few minutes later with a long-sleeved, collared blue shirt covering the Paul one, saying he was fearful of not becoming a delegate if he “looked like a Paul supporter.”He said that he had never been active in politics and had hoped to represent Mr. Paul, whose views on government spending and foreign policy he supported. But he would follow the wishes of the county, he said, in its support for Mr. Santorum, whom he called “my second choice.”He paused when asked if he would support Mr. Romney if he became the Republican nominee. Finally, he replied: “He’s a Republican Obama. He’s just like what we already have.”'"
"'12-03-17,'0','A little better free-throw shooting might have saved O’Quinn some anxiety. He missed three of his last four, including two with 3.8 seconds left that gave the Tigers (30-5) a chance to pull it out.Ricardo Ratliffe rebounded for Missouri, which called a timeout with 2.9 seconds to play. Phil Pressey fired up a 3-pointer from the left wing that bounced off the rim, and Pressey pulled his white jersey over his head as the Spartans celebrated behind him.“That was one of the most intense games I’ve ever been a part of,” Norfolk State Coach Anthony Evans said.Guards Pendarvis Williams and McEachin each added 20 for Norfolk State, and Michael Dixon had 22 and Pressey and Marcus Denmon 20 for Missouri.Kim English, Missouri’s second-leading scorer, who played with a bruised quadriceps, had only 2 points on 1-for-7 shooting.“He just wasn’t himself,” Missouri Coach Frank Haith said.The Spartans had seen Missouri’s four-guard look from teams in their conference, so nothing the Tigers did appeared to rattle them. Norfolk State used its size advantage to outrebound Missouri, 37-25, including 14-7 offensively. Twice, Norfolk State put back air balls for buckets.“They killed us on the glass,” Denmon said. “A lot of them were off us playing good defense originally, and then they would get a loose ball, an air ball, or a 3 that rebounded long.”Missouri had several opportunities to pull away in the second half. But Norfolk State refused to back down as the lead changed 14 times. That thrilled Kansas supporters who arrived early for their team’s night game against Detroit.With 7 minutes 56 seconds to play, the crowd howled in protest when O’Quinn blocked a Pressey driving layup from behind but was called for a foul. Later, a chant went up of “We Love You, N-S-U!” “I didn’t know they were cheering that,” he said. “Now that you say that, it feels good.”Dixon had tied the score, 81-81, with two foul shots when McEachin launched a long jumper from right wing. No one boxed out O’Quinn, who anticipated the air ball. “I didn’t know the guy was going to hit me,” said O’Quinn, meaning Matt Pressey, who committed the foul. “Good thing he hit me.”A wild 3-pointer by Denmon with the shot clock winding down caromed off the rim. O’Quinn rebounded and was fouled, but he only made the first. Phil Pressey’s 3-pointer cut it to 85-84 with 10.1 seconds left.Then Norfolk got two decisive breaks. Marcos Tamares mishandled Rodney McCauley’s inbounds pass, but the ball caromed right to McCauley, who was fouled and made one free throw with 8.2 seconds left. When McCauley missed the second, O’Quinn tipped the rebound twice before he and Phil Pressey fell to the court with it together. Norfolk State kept the ball on the possession arrow.Two seconds later, O’Quinn failed to clinch it from the line. That gave Phil Pressey one more chance.“Pressey got a great shot at the end,” O’Quinn said. “The ball could have bounced a different way, and we could have been on the other side. Thank God we’re on this side.”'"
"'12-03-17,'0','Only 1,193 people are allowed to vote in the elections on March 25. It is an elite group in which tycoons are heavily represented but that also includes members of the Legislature and of the National People’s Congress in Beijing. There are even 30 practitioners of traditional Chinese medicine, an obscure category included because they tend to follow Beijing’s instructions unquestioningly.But even during Prime Minister Wen Jiabao’s annual press conference on Wednesday, there were few hints of whether Mr. Tang or Mr. Leung was more in favor in Beijing. Mr. Tang, the son of wealthy industrialists who immigrated from Shanghai after the Communists took power on the mainland in 1949, was widely viewed here as a favorite of the influential Shanghai faction in Beijing. Yet he has not won any public endorsement from Beijing as he has acknowledged scandals involving marital infidelity and the construction of a capacious basement under his wife’s villa without planning permission or the payment of real estate taxes.One of the most striking features of the election campaign here, and the development that may cause the greatest discomfiture in Beijing, is that all three candidates are vying to outdo each other in allowing greater democracy in Hong Kong, as a way to increase their standings in polls of the general public.The Beijing authorities have said that they “may” allow universal suffrage — one person, one vote — in the 2017 chief executive election. But all three candidates in the race here strongly endorsed on Friday evening letting everyone vote in the 2017 election.Mr. Tang went further in the debate, also suggesting the abolition of so-called functional constituencies, representing sectors of the economy like banking and commerce, in the 2020 legislative elections. Half the seats in the Legislature are occupied by representatives of functional constituencies now — Mr. Tang used to be one of them — and they have been the bedrock of pro-Beijing votes on legislation even as the general population has tended to elect democracy advocates to the other half of the Legislature.Mr. Leung helped Beijing draft Hong Kong’s Basic Law, which has been the territory’s miniconstitution ever since the British returned it to Hong Kong in 1997, and which is widely seen here as being close to the Chinese Communist Party. But he also endorsed universal suffrage during the debate, saying that “Hong Kong does not belong to a small circle; it belongs to everyone.”'"
"'12-03-17,'0','The additional cost of the expanded baby benefits alone will total $4.6 billion a year, according to an estimate by the Higher School of Economics in Moscow.Most of Mr. Putin’s spending promises came at least partly in response to the street demonstrations by young and middle-class protesters in Moscow and other big cities challenging his authority in the weeks leading up to the March 4 election. His apparent aim was to shore up support from the rest of Russia: poorer and rural parts of the country, and from state workers and the elderly.The repercussions of his campaign promises, and an earlier commitment on military spending, could be felt for years to come, giving price swings in oil a bigger role than ever on the Russian economy.Taxes on oil and natural gas sales provide half of Russia’s government revenue. Each increase in the Russian budget equivalent to 1 percent of the gross domestic product requires a rise in the price of oil of about $10 a barrel on global markets — which is how Citigroup arrived at the $150-a-barrel figure for meeting the new obligations Mr. Putin has taken on.Analysts worry that, even if the government can fulfill its promises, too little will remain for a sovereign wealth fund that is intended as a shock absorber for the Russian economy and the ruble exchange rate during an oil price slump. Russia needed to use that buffer as recently as 2008, during the financial crisis.“The concern is simple,” Kingsmill Bond, the chief strategist at Citigroup in Russia, said in a telephone interview. “If the oil price that Russia requires to balance its budget is higher, the systemic risks that the market faces are also higher.”The bank estimated that Mr. Putin’s promises of higher wages and pensions, not counting the military outlays, add up to additional spending equal to 1.5 percent of Russia’s gross domestic product. That comes on top of an earlier pledge to spend an additional 3 percent of gross domestic product a year re-arming the military.In all, the new commitments would add up to about $98 billion a year, Citigroup estimates.The spillover from the Arab Spring and the specter of an Israeli attack on Iran’s nuclear development plants are propping up oil prices now. But over the long term, economic stagnation in Europe could help bring them down.Even before the election, Russia’s government spending was up, helping reinforce Mr. Putin’s message that he was the best candidate to deliver prosperity and stability. In January, the Russian military ministry, for example, doubled salaries in the nation’s million-person army. It was ostensibly a long-planned move. But coming just two months before the presidential vote, the political message was clear.Also smoothing the path for Mr. Putin’s victory was a national cap on utility rates that helped keep inflation at the lowest level in Russia’s post-Soviet history for January and February, at a 3.7 percent annual pace.“Putin made large spending commitments,” the Fitch rating agency said in a statement released the day after the election.“The current high price of oil cushions Russia’s public finances,” Fitch said. “But in the absence of fiscal tightening that significantly cuts the non-oil and gas fiscal deficit, a severe and sustained drop in the oil price would have a damaging impact on the Russian economy and public finances and would likely lead to a downgrade” of the nation’s credit rating.As Mr. Putin’s spending promises started to be introduced in January, Fitch altered Russia’s outlook to stable, from positive.Mr. Putin has defended the proposed spending as necessary and just, given the hardship of teachers and other public sector workers in the post-Soviet years. “A doctor, a teacher, a professor, these people should make enough money where they work so they don’t have to look for a side job,” Mr. Putin wrote in a manifesto published during the campaign.But in fact, the government will offset a portion of the pay raises, perhaps as much as one-third of their cost, by laying off some public sector workers and trimming some other public spending. That was the word from Lev I. Yakobson, the deputy rector of the Higher School of Economics, who helped draft the policy.That part of the plan, though, was never part of Mr. Putin’s stump speech.'"
"'12-03-17,'0','RelayRides is one of several car-sharing services to arrive on the scene in recent years. Getaround is another start-up, as are JustShareIt and Wheelz, a company that the car-sharing giant Zipcar invested in last month.They’re all part of a larger “collaborative consumption” movement that has captured the imagination of a growing number of civic-minded, Web-addicted people who want to both save some money and use a bit less of the world’s resources. This includes home-sharing services like Airbnb, office-sharing services like Loosecubes and general sharing sites like NeighborGoods and Rentabilities.The car-sharing services allow you, in effect, to turn your personal car into a Zipcar and rent it out by the hour or the day. You set the price, and the intermediary service lists your car online, connects you with people who want to rent it and takes a cut of the fee. Renters use a smart card to open your locks and get to the key, or you can exchange the key in person. G.M.’s investment in RelayRides holds out the promise of G.M.’s OnStar service opening the car for you, too.For all of this to work, there are a few mental hurdles that car owners need to clear besides generalized fear of strangers and whatever cooties they leave on the steering wheel. Are they safe drivers? (Car-sharing services generally check driving records.) Will someone try to steal my car? (Yes, they will, if it’s expensive enough and the car-sharing company lacks proper controls; this problem has already put one company out of business.)But the biggest challenge is insurance. Here’s the basic problem: Car insurance companies generally will not cover a claim that results from you putting your personal vehicle into commercial use, say by running a taxi service on the side — or making yourself into a one-person Hertz. RelayRides is well aware of this and provides $1 million of liability coverage in the event that a driver kills or maims somebody else while using your car. This is intended to fill the gap in coverage created by the fact that your own insurance company would refuse to pay this claim if the victim came after you.This raises questions about three potential situations.First, if some sort of catastrophic accident results in a claim of more than $1 million, what happens then? The answer is that you could be responsible for paying it. The odds of an injury this horrid and a legal judgment that blames you for renting your car to someone who crashes it are extremely low. I laid out the long odds in a column last year about Zipcar’s insurance coverage for renters (I link to it in the online version of this column.)Only you can be the judge of how uncomfortable this makes you.Second, do the rules change if you haven’t been taking good care of your car and that contributes to an accident? RelayRides’s terms of service seem to protect the company here, since it “disclaims” any “warranty” for “fitness for a particular purpose.” Meanwhile, a law in Oregon that relates to insurance coverage for car sharing quite specifically gives car-sharing companies the right to go after vehicle owners who engage in “material misrepresentation in the maintenance of the vehicle.”RelayRides and its general counsel counter with two points. First, they say that language elsewhere in the company’s terms supersedes the fitness disclaimer. Second, the Oregon statute and its presumably high bar for “material misrepresentation” aside, RelayRides’ insurance broker,  Bill Curtis, makes the following pledge: “I’m willing to raise my hand and say, ‘Yes,’ to the question of whether the owner will have protection in the event that they are sued and the allegation is that the car wasn’t maintained,” he said.Third, there’s the question of what your insurance company thinks about all of this. I had a hard time finding out, frankly. Geico wouldn’t respond to any of my requests for comment.An industry group, the Insurance Information Institute, meanwhile, is not pleased. “If the ‘renter’ were involved in an accident, most likely the insurer would non-renew or maybe even rescind the auto policy,” Loretta Worters, its spokeswoman, said in an e-mailed statement. Translation: If someone wrecks your car and injures someone and a lawyer tries to reel in your insurer as well as the car-sharing company’s insurer, your insurer may take away your coverage.RelayRides takes exception with this, given that the word “rescind” could make people think that insurance companies would take away coverage retroactively. “It’s ridiculous,” Mr. Curtis said.USAA, which has always gotten high marks for customer service, takes an even sterner approach than the institute. I’m a USAA customer myself, and I asked the company what would happen if I or others called and confessed that we’d signed up for RelayRides.“We would inform them that participating in such a program will generally result in non-renewal,” Roger Wildermuth, a USAA spokesman, said in an e-mail message.Allstate took a similar tack. “The owner could put their current coverage for personal use of the vehicle in jeopardy as the act of making the vehicle available for rental purposes could inherently change the risk profile of the vehicle,” said Kevin Smith, a company spokesman.  “And by entering into commercial arrangements with their vehicle, the insured may risk being unable to secure auto coverage from our company in the future.”Not every insurer responded this way. A Progressive spokesman, Jeff Sibel, said that while there were certain risks that would cause the company to cancel coverage on the spot if it found out about them, car sharing was not one of them “at this time.”Meanwhile, at least three states (California, Oregon and Washington) have passed laws that generally prohibit insurance companies from dropping your coverage simply because you’re renting your car out via a car-sharing service.I wish I knew which way the wind was ultimately blowing on this, but of the other seven major insurers I approached for comment, all either declined to talk at all or declined to squarely address this non-renewal question.Their general wariness doesn’t surprise industry watchers, though. “The easiest answer for an insurance company is no,” said Sunil Paul, a venture capitalist who helped get the California law passed and has flirted with entering the car-sharing business. “There is no downside to no. Their knee-jerk reaction is why we need laws like the one in California.”Or it’s simply an effort to sell more insurance. After all, fewer cars on the road with more people sharing them means fewer sales of personal policies.But none of this leaves consumers with a clear sense of what to do. If you call your insurance company and ask for permission to rent out your car, as some of my colleagues did this week, the people you talk to may tell you that you’re nuts to even consider this, which is indeed what we heard.To RelayRides, however, dutifully doing what some ignorant frontline agent tells you to do is to stand against innovative companies and progressive values.“The insurance industry has already demonstrated acceptance of peer-to-peer cars sharing through their support of car-sharing legislation in three states,” the company said in a statement.“Insurers also regularly deal with exclusions, for example, for part-time commercial purposes such as pizza delivery,” the statement continued. “Since our founding almost two years ago, we’ve been operating in Massachusetts without car-sharing legislation and without any problems. Given that we provide insurance for the rental period, we do not anticipate any problems for car owners. As with any new service, we work closely with all organizations to ensure that the best interests of all parties are protected.” I asked both Google and G.M. for comment, and neither offered one.I, for one, am glad RelayRides is out there taking the bullets. Their idea is a good one, and I’d consider participating myself, but I’m also not about to willingly defy my insurance company.'"
"'12-03-17,'0','But with no word yet on what impact the latest American move has had, Western officials and rights advocates here are viewing the hard line as a troubling sign: not just of waning Western influence as relations have worsened, but also for maintaining hard-won gains in rights for women in Afghanistan as the prospect of a speeded-up American withdrawal has become a greater possibility.This is not an oversimplified case of high-minded Westerners versus conservative Afghans. The West’s role in Afghanistan has empowered many Afghans to champion women’s and minority rights in the past decade, and those home-grown reformers have helped establish most of the social changes that have been seen as encouraging steps here.Yet the Afghans at the forefront of pressing for those rights are already finding themselves increasingly marginalized as Afghanistan’s old guard flexes its muscles. In fact, the official in charge of all of Afghanistan’s civilian prisons, Gen. Amir Jamshid, has tried and failed to stop the invasive searches of women, his objections overridden by Mr. Mohammadi, the interior minister, Afghan and American officials said. Those officials spoke on condition of anonymity to avoid offending their Afghan counterparts.Other worrying signs have appeared. President Hamid Karzai in December removed outspoken members of the Afghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission, which is appointed by the government but acts independently.Then this month, Afghanistan’s Ulema Council, the country’s highest religious authority, released a “code of conduct” that suggested it was permissible for a man to beat his wife under certain circumstances. President Karzai endorsed the code last week, in a move seen as part of his efforts to reach out to hard-liners among the ahead of an American withdrawal.“There has been important progress made on human rights in the last 10 years, largely due to brave Afghans inside and outside the government,” said Heather Barr, the Afghanistan researcher for . “But they’ve needed international support and without it, they may see their work become impossible.”American officials cautioned that trouble at one prison did not herald the overall collapse of Western influence, and that they believed they could still effect change, especially at Pul-e-Charki, which houses about 7,000 convicts.But they have so far failed to stop the invasive searches, which were first noticed by American mentors at the prison in mid-February, according to multiple American and Western officials.The Americans have since then twice received assurances that the practice would stop — once from General Khan and then later from Mr. Mohammadi. It has nonetheless continued, and the American Embassy said this week it was still discussing the matter with the Interior Ministry. It is not clear whether women face the same kinds of searches at Afghanistan’s other civilian prisons.Since June 2009, the has earmarked $26.8 million for renovations at the prison, and just over half of that has already been spent.“I don’t think we’d be facing the same kind of resistance if this was last year or the year before,” said one American official in Kabul. “We’re going, and they know it.”A request from to visit Pul-e-Charki was turned down by the Interior Ministry.Saturday is the next visiting day at Pul-e-Charki, which is run by civilian authorities. General Khan, who comes from the police force, said in a telephone interview the searches would continue.“Stopping somebody hiding narcotics or mobile phone or banned items, that’s not a violation of their rights,” he said.The prison, he said, is thick with Taliban detainees and rife with contraband and needs to be brought under control. He said Taliban commanders held there were plotting attacks in Kabul, a view shared by American officials.General Khan said the invasive searches would stop once America bought an machine for the prison — a purchase that American officials say they have no plans to make. He added that men suspected of smuggling could also face a similar kind of search. And he insisted that the searches were conducted only on “suspicious” women.That account was countered by a female guard at the prison and by Western and Afghan officials familiar with the situation.“We have been strictly ordered to search genital areas of all the women who are visiting the prisoners,” said the guard, who asked not to be named for fear of losing her job. She added that even the prisoners, all of whom are men, are patted down only after meeting visitors.She said that the guards sometimes find phones or drugs in searches, but that she was still uncomfortable with the blanket order to search all women. She said many of her fellow guards felt the same, and they sometimes let women pass without searches when they could.The Afghan woman who had been subjected to the searches said the practice had been going on since at least last year, though it had gotten stricter in the past few months. “I have been subjected to this humiliating type of body search more than 20 to 25 times,” said the woman, who did not want to be identified because she felt ashamed.'"
"'12-03-17,'0','Consumer prices rose to a 10-month high in February as the cost of gasoline spiked, the Labor Department said Friday, but there was little sign that underlying inflation pressures were building up.Surging gasoline prices hurt consumer confidence early this month, other data showed on Friday. Still, Americans apparently do not believe the sharp run-up in prices will last.The Labor Department said the Consumer Price Index rose 0.4 percent in February after advancing 0.2 percent in January. Gasoline accounted for more than 80 percent of the rise.Stripping out volatile food and energy costs, the so-called core C.P.I., edged up just 0.1 percent.“Consumer purchasing power, at least for the next few months, is going to remain pressured by rising gasoline prices,” Sam Bullard, a senior economist at Wells Fargo Securities in Charlotte, N.C., said. However, he said a trend toward lower inflation was still in place.Consumer prices rose 2.9 percent last month from the same period a year ago, unchanged from January but down from a peak of 3.9 percent in September. The core index was up 2.2 percent over the 12 months through February, down from 2.3 percent in January.Rising gasoline prices helped pull the preliminary Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan index on consumer sentiment down to 74.3 early this month from 75.3 in February.'"
"'12-03-17,'0','WASHINGTON — An Afghan interpreter in a speeding truck tried to run down a top American commander and his British deputy, forcing the two and others to scatter as Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta’s plane taxied toward them at a military base in Afghanistan, defense officials said on Friday.The latest account of what apparently was a suicide attack shows there was a greater security risk to Mr. Panetta than defense officials originally admitted. American military officials had at first played down the episode, which occurred on Wednesday at Camp Bastion in Helmand Province in southern Afghanistan, and they did not immediately disclose important details.It was not until Friday that defense officials said that Mr. Panetta had already landed when the attack occurred, although they did not say how close his plane came to the speeding truck. But one of the officials acknowledged that if the attack had occurred five minutes later, it was “possible” that Mr. Panetta would have been on the tarmac and in the path of the speeding truck along with the commanders, who had been waiting for him as part of a welcoming party.The officials, who spoke to reporters on Mr. Panetta’s plane en route from Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, to Washington, asked for anonymity to discuss security matters.Defense officials said the Afghan interpreter, who apparently set himself on fire, had aimed his truck directly at a group that included Maj. Gen. Charles M. Gurganus of the Marines, the top commander in Helmand, and his British deputy, Brig. Stuart Skeates. A day earlier, military officials described the welcoming party as “a group of Marines,” suggesting they were of lower rank — and omitting that the attacker was heading for one of the most senior American military commanders in Afghanistan.'"

"'12-03-18,'0','PORTLAND, Ore. — As New Mexico mounted a late comeback, Louisville turned to the player who revived its championship hopes over the past month. Sure, guard Peyton Siva produced relatively ordinary statistics Saturday, but he also calmed the Cardinals and quelled the comeback.The shift took place late in the second half, with the Lobos (28-7), seeded fifth in the West Region, surging against the Cardinals, seeded fourth. Already, Siva had slowed the pace, taken control. He stood near midcourt, bouncing the ball, then surged toward the basket, creating a lane for center Gorgui Dieng, who took a pass and slammed home a dunk.That effectively ended the Lobos’ season, as Louisville (28-9) held on for a 59-56 victory at the Rose Garden. The win marked the Cardinals’ sixth-consecutive triumph, dating to their final regular-season game, continuing through the Big East tournament and now through two rounds here. Louisville will play the winner of Michigan State-St. Louis this week in Phoenix.Siva finished with 6 points and 6 assists, statistics that failed to fully describe his impact. Russ Smith chipped in 17 points off the bench.Louisville broke the game open early in the second half behind its signature pressure defense. Siva grabbed a loose ball, sprinted toward the basket, then fired a behind-the-back pass to Kyle Kuric, who laid it in. Immediately after that, guard Russ Smith stole the ball and scored. The Cardinals led, 40-29. New Mexico, though, would come back, although only part of the way.'"
"'12-03-18,'0','State Senator Robert Duncan, Republican of Lubbock, said such schools allow young people to stay close to home longer. “The key to maintaining population in rural areas is making sure different generations have a reason to come back,” he said.Mr. Duncan noted that in addition to state appropriations declining, which means schools are increasingly relying on tuition and local taxes, a quirk in the taxing system can limit financing for such colleges.South Plains College in Levelland, for example, serves an area in the Panhandle that is larger than some states, but it can collect taxes only from its local area. Though it is the main feeder for Texas Tech University in Lubbock, its tax base does not extend the 30 miles to the city.Rural West Texas colleges, therefore, must generate significant local buy-in. The community college tax rates around South Plains and Western Texas are more than double those for colleges in urban areas like Austin or Dallas.Western Texas officials have struck a deal with the local community. Any students from Scurry County, the local tax base, can attend free if they maintain certain grades and standards.For many residents, it is an impossible deal to turn down. Tanner Robertson, a student from Snyder in his second year at Western Texas, never questioned where he would go after high school. “You graduate from Snyder High School, and you go to W.T.C.,” he said. “It’s what you’re raised to do.”Increasingly, Mr. Dreith said, the school is working with estate planners and companies to finance its operations to ensure its future.“We spend as much time on that, unfortunately, by virtue of the financial circumstances that we’re in, as we do on student success, which is really Job 1,” he said, noting that Western Texas still has among the highest community college graduation rates in the state.The financial situation at South Plains is not as dire, because it is less remote, but the schools’ concerns are similar, and so are their aspirations. “Our goal is to sustain rural Texas,” said Kelvin Sharp, the college’s president.“We can’t all live in Lubbock,” he said. “Some people have to live in Muleshoe, Plains or Denver City. And you have to have an auto mechanic, and firefighters, nurses and all the things we offer in technical ed. You have to have those basic services.”'"
"'12-03-18,'0','Wisconsin moves on to face Syracuse on Thursday. Vanderbilt’s season ends at 25-11.Jenkins’s missed shot saved Wisconsin. But for most of the second half, the Badgers’ savior was the most unlikely candidate on their roster: the sophomore guard Ben Brust.In November and December, Brust averaged 10.7 points per game and hit 40.1 percent of his 3-point attempts. In the last 12 games, those numbers were 2.5 points and 29.7 percent.But with the rest of the Badgers as frigid as a Wisconsin winter during the second half, Brust scalded Vanderbilt. During a stretch of the second half that covered nearly 12 minutes, he scored all 11 of Wisconsin’s points — one more point than he had scored in the previous six games combined.“I’ve got great teammates,” Brust said. “They never gave up on me.”The Badgers led most of the game, but long cold stretches from outside kept them from putting the game away. Wisconsin’s inside game was neutralized by Vanderbilt center Festus Ezeli, who at 6 feet 11 inches and 255 pounds is about an inch taller and 20 pounds heavier than any Badgers starter.Ezeli’s presence forced the Badgers to stay outside and let shots fly. Thirty-three of their 55 attempts were from beyond the 3-point arc.Nevertheless, the Badgers took advantage of the rare chances to attack the interior, particularly early in the game. They jumped to a 7-2 lead with Ezeli on the bench at the game’s start, increased it to 10-2 after he entered and eventually built a 9-point cushion.Vanderbilt guard Jeffery Taylor struggled in his return to the Pit, where he won a high school state championship in 2008. He was held to 9 points on 4-of-12 shooting and did not score until the second half.“It was a bittersweet experience,” Taylor said. “I was hoping to get the same kind of ending I got last time I was here.”Taylor’s first basket gave Vanderbilt its first lead, 33-32. But it lasted only 92 seconds, and the Commodores’ deficit was back to 7 after back-to-back 3-pointers and two turnovers spurred an 8-0 Badgers run.Wisconsin maintained the lead until Ezeli blocked a layup, then converted a layup of his own 18 seconds later to give the Commodores a 57-56 edge with 2 minutes 19 seconds remaining.But Jordan Taylor then drilled a 3-pointer to put the Badgers in front to stay.'"
"'12-03-18,'0','BAGHDAD — An American man who said he had been kidnapped nine months ago by Iraqi militants was handed over to United States officials in Baghdad on Saturday night in a bizarre and murky series of events that caught diplomats here by surprise.Speaking at a news conference in Baghdad, the camouflage-clad American, identified as Rand Hultz, said he was a former soldier who had returned to Iraq as a civilian contractor before being kidnapped last June by a Shiite paramilitary group loyal to the anti-American Shiite cleric Moktada al-Sadr. He said he had been shuffled from house to house around Baghdad before his release on Saturday.“It was explained to me that this is a gift to me, my family and the American people who opposed the war,” Mr. Hultz said in a stilted, sometimes halting deadpan during the news conference. “Without a doubt I and my family thank Saeed Moktada al-Sadr.”At the news conference, Sadrist politicians called the American’s release a demonstration of the “humanitarian and moral standards of the Iraqi Islamic resistance” meant to cultivate good will after the American military’s withdrawal from Iraq.They said there had been no negotiations with the Americans — Mr. Hultz was released to United Nations officials, who then turned him over to the Americans.Officials at the United States Embassy were scrambling on Saturday night to understand what had happened. They said they had no records of any American citizen still considered missing in Iraq, and some learned of his resurfacing from news reports. The State Department confirmed that the United Nations had transferred an American citizen to the embassy in Baghdad, but cited privacy laws that prevented them from releasing his name, or any details about him, without his consent.'"
"'12-03-18,'0','The victory moved the streaking Penguins 2 points behind the Eastern Conference-leading Rangers, whom Pittsburgh beat, 5-2, on Thursday in Crosby’s comeback game. The Rangers hosted Colorado on Saturday night.On Thursday, Crosby returned after missing 40 games because of concussion and neck injury symptoms. He took one shot and had two assists in 16 minutes. He was originally credited with one assist in that game, but on Friday afternoon the N.H.L. ruled he touched the puck just before Pascal Dupuis scored the game’s last goal.Crosby has 17 points in 10 games this season, on 2 goals and 15 assists. His 1.70 points per game is the best average in the N.H.L., followed by Malkin’s 1.38 on a league-leading 87 points in 63 games. Malkin had a goal and an assist Saturday.The Penguins, who have won 23 of their last 28 games, were something of a juggernaut before Crosby’s return, and they may be even more of one now.“We’re a team, and you’re happy to see your teammates do well,” Crosby said. “When I wasn’t in for the previous nine games, I was just as happy to see guys do well. There’s a good feeling when you’re rewarded for your efforts.”Against the Devils, Crosby set up Cooke for the goal that gave Pittsburgh a 3-1 lead. He burst down the right wing on a quick two-on-one break, drew defenseman Mark Fayne toward him and zipped a perfect pass to the goalmouth that Cooke knocked in with his skate. The goal withstood a review.Crosby also set up a power-play goal later in the second period that made the score 4-1. He was bumped to one knee by Jacob Josefson along the left-wing boards, but got to his feet still stick-handling. He sent a cross-ice laser to Malkin, whose one-timer produced his 40th goal of the season.On Cooke’s second goal, which made the score 5-2, Crosby merely touched the puck before Tyler Kennedy’s flubbed shot was slotted home by Cooke.Crosby came close to increasing his point total, but he was robbed by acrobatic saves from goalie Martin Brodeur on at least three shots.“I’m always looking for a goal,” Crosby said. “Marty made some great saves today.”Crosby almost set up a goal on his first shift with a backhand pass that freed Chris Kunitz for a breakaway, forcing Devils defenseman Marek Zidlicky to trip Kunitz. But Brodeur stopped Kunitz on the ensuing penalty shot.As they had Thursday against the Rangers, the Penguins possessed the puck so thoroughly they often seemed to be on a permanent power play. They outshot the Devils, 44-14.The Devils’ only threats came on occasional counterattacks. They scored on one at 16:57 of the first period, tying the score at 1-1 on Andy Greene’s first goal of the season, in his 46th game. It ended the Devils’ goal drought at 147:38, almost two and a half games.Crosby played with Cooke and Kennedy on his wings more often than he did against the Rangers, but he also had shifts with other wings. He also skated a couple of shifts as a wing with Staal centering.Crosby said Thursday that he was trying to stay away from contact rather than courting it as he did in his first comeback, which lasted eight games in November and December before his concussion symptoms forced him out again.“I’ve noticed a slightly different mind-set from his eight-game stretch earlier this year, when he was using his body more,” Penguins Coach Dan Bylsma said. “Now he’s using his stick more to break up plays in tight situations.”Crosby did have one brief moment of contact against the Devils when he wound up in Brodeur’s crease, poking once for the puck. Devils defenseman Mark Fayne shoved him lightly but firmly against the crossbar as the whistle blew. Crosby shoved Fayne back harder, but both players disengaged.The Penguins, whose 11-game winning streak is the longest in the N.H.L. this season, got 12 saves from Marc-Andre Fleury. James Neal scored his 32nd goal, and Dupuis notched his 20th.The loss left the Devils six points behind the Penguins.'"
"'12-03-18,'0','Gonzaga, which led by as many as 7 points in the first half, had its chances in the endgame but could not hit shots at the most significant moments. The Bulldogs rallied from a 10-point deficit midway through the second half and drew level, at 61-61 with four minutes left, but did not make another basket until 12 seconds remained.In a critical sequence, Gonzaga guard Kevin Pangos, who was blanketed by Craft all game and finished 3 of 13 from the field, missed a 3-pointer from the corner with 1 minute 27 seconds left. Sullinger responded at the other end with a pretty post move that pushed the Ohio State lead to 5.“It felt really good,” Pangos said of the shot, which bounced in and out. “I was relaxed. It just came off my hand nice. I thought it was good, for sure. But it rolled out.”Few added, “If Kevin’s 3 from the corner goes in, we might be dealing with something different here.”Although Gonzaga and Ohio State combined to win their opening games by 42 points, the sentiment for each team coming into the game was different. Gonzaga beat up on West Virginia, which was playing just 75 miles from its Morgantown campus and had a sizable advantage in crowd support. The Bulldogs flew up and down the floor against the Mountaineers, leaving Few and the players brimming with confidence as they tried to become the third team in 24 hours to knock off a No. 2 seed.Ohio State, on the other hand, was sluggish Thursday in beating Loyola (Md.), which won the Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference tournament but was not expected to hang around against the Buckeyes for as long as it did. Afterward, several Ohio State players talked about lacking an edge in their performance, and Matta implored them to up their intensity or face the consequences against Gonzaga.Ultimately, they did play harder. Even with Sullinger struggling with foul trouble in the first half, the Buckeyes refused to let Gonzaga get too far ahead early. After trailing, 30-23, with about seven minutes remaining in the opening period, Ohio State finished the half with a 16-7 run to lead by 2 at halftime. They did not trail again.“It was tough for them to guard us,” Thomas said. “They can’t just focus on one guy.”After the final buzzer, the Gonzaga senior Robert Sacre — who contained Sullinger for most of the game — gathered his teammates on the court. It was Sacre’s last game, and he had been taught by previous team leaders, he said, to bring the players together.Sacre was not on the team when it made its first surprising run, to the Round of 8 in 1999, but he was at Gonzaga, as a redshirt, in 2009 when the Bulldogs made the Round of 16. Even as he sees other upstart programs making waves in the tournament, he knows about Gonzaga’s history.“We still are America’s team,” he said. “I don’t know why people forget that.”'"
"'12-03-18,'0','Jeff Bingaman, chairman of the Senate energy committee, complained the other day of “widespread misunderstanding” about rising oil prices. He was being senatorially polite.The issue of gas prices has not only been misunderstood but thoroughly distorted by relentless ideological spin from industry and its political allies, mainly Republican. Hardly a day goes by that some industry cheerleader somewhere — be it Gov. Bobby Jindal of Louisiana or Senator James Inhofe of Oklahoma — does not flay President Obama for driving up oil prices by denying the industry access to oil and gas deposits and imposing ruinous environmental rules. Senator John Barrasso, a Wyoming Republican, said last week that Mr. Obama should be held “fully responsible for what the American public is paying for gasoline.”If only the president had the power to give us $2.50-a-gallon gasoline, as Newt Gingrich promised to do if he got to the White House. It is ridiculous to think that a president can.One can sympathize with consumers feeling the pain of higher gas prices. But the fundamental truth is that those prices are tied to the price of oil, set by world markets. There are peaks and valleys, but their causes — a worldwide recession, an embargo or conflict in the Middle East — are beyond the control of any one country. As the chart below shows, gasoline prices rise and fall in the same pattern throughout the world. Americans historically pay much less at the pump because they pay lower taxes; when the price of a gallon spikes at $3.70 in the United States, it is closer to $8 in, say, Germany.Because oil is a global commodity, increasing domestic production will do very little to bring down retail prices, although it does help narrow the trade deficit as America spends less on imports. On this score, America is doing much better than the Republicans will admit. In 2005, oil imports accounted for nearly 60 percent of America’s daily consumption. In 2010, for the first time in recent memory, imports were less than half of consumption, and last year, imports were only 45 percent — 8.6 million barrels a day of the 19 million consumed. There are two reasons for this welcome shift: production is up and oil consumption is down. Production of crude oil and other liquid fuels, onshore and offshore, reached about 10.3 million barrels daily in 2011, its highest level since the late 1980s.Some of the biggest discoveries have occurred on private land in deep shale formations in Texas and North Dakota, and production on federal land is beginning to boom, too. The real issue, which industry’s allies never mention, is whether the oil companies are fully exploiting the federal resources they already control. Mr. Bingaman notes that 7,000 approved onshore drilling permits have been sitting unused by the companies that own them, and that millions of acres under lease in the gulf remain unexplored.The most encouraging news is on the consumption side. Americans are getting more miles to the gallon, which means there’s that much less carbon dioxide going into the atmosphere. We used 20.8 million barrels a day in 2005, the highest level in history. That dropped to just under 19 million barrels last year, and, according to the federal Energy Information Administration, is likely to stay there awhile. The recession has had a lot to do with the decline, but so has fuel efficiency. Ten years ago, cars and light trucks (including S.U.V.’s) averaged 24.7 miles a gallon. In 2011, the figure rose to 29.6 miles a gallon as consumers chose more efficient cars. Two landmark agreements between the administration and the automakers — aimed at improving efficiency and reducing greenhouse gases — could raise it to 55 miles per gallon by 2025.'"

"'12-03-18,'0','Nazi hunters and protesters who had demonstrated outside his home for years had no doubts. Nor did the Justice Department. Mr. Demjanjuk, stripped of his citizenship in 1981, was deported to Israel, where witnesses and an identity card of “Ivan the Terrible,” a sadist who had murdered thousands of Jews at Treblinka, had turned up. The photograph on the card bore a striking resemblance to Mr. Demjanjuk.He was placed on trial, convicted in 1988 of crimes against humanity and sentenced to be hanged. But five years later, the Israeli Supreme Court overturned the conviction when new evidence showed that another Ukrainian was probably the notorious Ivan. Back in America, Mr. Demjanjuk regained his citizenship, only to have it revoked again as new allegations arose.Deported to Germany in 2009, Mr. Demjanjuk, suffering from bone-marrow and kidney diseases, was tried in a Munich court on charges in the killing of 27,900 Jews at the Sobibor camp in German-occupied Poland in 1943. In the nearly seven decades since 250,000 people were put to death at Sobibor, no surviving witnesses, even those who had been shown photographs, could place him at the scene.The case was largely based on documentary evidence — an S.S. identity card purporting to be Mr. Demjanjuk’s, Nazi orders sending the man identified as Mr. Demjanjuk to work as a guard at Sobibor and other records of the era — and testimony by relatives of victims killed in the camp.In May 2011, the Munich court found Mr. Demjanjuk guilty and sentenced him to five years in prison. He was credited with two years of pretrial detention, leaving three left to serve if an appeal failed. Pending the appeal, he was released from prison and transferred to a nursing home. The court said his age, infirmity and statelessness made it unlikely he would flee.Even some relatives of the victims, who were recognized as co-complainants at the trial, said it was the proof of guilt, finally, that counted. “Whether it’s three, four or five years doesn’t really matter,” said David van Huiden, who lost his mother, father and sister at Sobibor. “He took part. He volunteered.”Mr. Demjanjuk’s son, however, said that under German law, a conviction is not official until appeals are completed, and that his father’s death had the effect of “voiding” the Munich verdict.Mr. Demjanjuk died a “a victim and a survivor of Soviet and German brutality,” his son said, adding, “History will show Germany used him as a scapegoat to blame helpless Ukrainian P.O.W.’s for the deeds of Nazi Germans.”Ivan Demjanjuk (pronounced (dem-YAHN-yook) was born on April 3, 1920, in Dubovye Makharintsy, a village in Ukraine, to impoverished, disabled parents. The family nearly starved in a forced famine in the early 1930s that left millions dead in Ukraine. He had only four years of schooling, and was drafted into the Soviet Army in 1941. In 1942, the Germans wounded and captured him in the Crimea. What he did for the rest of the war was the crux of the issues surrounding his later life.After the war, Mr. Demjanjuk met Vera Bulochnik in a German camp for displaced persons. They married and in 1950, still living in camps, had a daughter, Lydia. In 1952, they emigrated to the United States and settled in Cleveland. Mr. Demjanjuk became a mechanic at a Ford plant and she worked in a factory. The couple had two more children, John Jr. and Irene. In 1958, Mr. Demjanjuk was naturalized. In 1973, the family moved to the Cleveland suburb of Seven Hills.Besides his son, Mr. Demjanjuk is survived by his wife; his two daughters, Lydia Maday and Irene Nishnic; seven grandchildren; and two great-grandchildren.In 1977, the Justice Department sued to revoke Mr. Demjanjuk’s citizenship, saying he had lied on his immigration application to hide mass murders and other war crimes at Treblinka, the camp in Poland where 870,000 died. The accusations arose from Holocaust survivors who had identified Mr. Demjanjuk as Ivan the Terrible, a Ukrainian captured and trained by the Germans to operate gas chambers.In 1981, after years of delays, a federal judge ruled that Mr. Demjanjuk had lied on his immigration papers and revoked his citizenship. He appealed, and the case was pending when Israel extradited him to stand trial as Ivan the Terrible. He was deported to Israel in 1986, and the trial began in 1987.Prosecutors produced a Nazi identity card, said to be from the S.S. training camp at Trawniki, Poland, that bore what looked like Mr. Demjanjuk’s photograph. It cited his name and date of birth, his father’s name, and a scar like one Mr. Demjanjuk had.Prosecutors said he had volunteered to collaborate and had been trained at Trawniki to run diesel engines that supplied carbon monoxide for gas chambers. They said he had killed thousands at Treblinka in 1942 and 1943. Treblinka survivors testified that Ivan the Terrible had also savaged Jews, breaking arms and legs with a steel pipe, cutting off ears and noses with a sword, and flogging women and children with sadistic glee.But the defense noted that the survivors were relying on memories four decades old. It also challenged the identity card, saying the photo showed signs of having been lifted from another document, cited an incorrect height for Mr. Demjanjuk, and said its bearer had been at camps in Poland at Chelmno in 1942 and Sobibor in 1943 but did not mention Treblinka. Mr. Demjanjuk testified that he had been held as a prisoner at Chelmno for 18 months until 1944, and then in Austria until the war’s end.Found guilty and sentenced to death in 1988, he was held until 1993, when the Israeli Supreme Court struck down his conviction, citing new evidence from former guards at Treblinka that Ivan the Terrible was another Ukrainian, Ivan Marchenko. On his citizenship application, Mr. Demjanjuk had listed his mother’s maiden name as Marchenko, but contended later that he had forgotten her real maiden name and used Marchenko only because it was common in Ukraine.Released by Israel, Mr. Demjanjuk returned to Cleveland, where a federal appeals court overturned his 1981 conviction for lying on his immigration papers, saying prosecutors had deliberately withheld evidence and committed fraud. His citizenship was restored in 1998.But in 1999, the government again sued to strip him of citizenship, charging that he had been a Nazi guard at Majdanek and Sobibor in Poland and at Flossenbürg in Bavaria. After a trial, a court in 2002 upheld the government. An appeal confirmed the decision in 2004. In 2005, he was ordered deported to Germany, Poland or Ukraine, and the United States Supreme Court denied him a hearing in 2008.In 2009, Germany agreed to accept Mr. Demjanjuk as a deportee to stand trial on charges that he helped kill Jews at Sobibor. His lawyers and family argued that he was too sick, but doctors concluded that he was fit enough.The case involved 15 transport trains known to have arrived at Sobibor in 1943 from the Westerbork camp in the Netherlands, carrying 29,579 people. Mr. Demjanjuk was charged with 27,900 counts based on a theory that some must have died in transit.“When a transport of Jews arrived, routine work was suspended and all camp personnel took part in the routine process of extermination,” the indictment said. The unloading of the trains proceeded “with loud cries, blows and also shots. If people refused to come out, the Trawnikis entered the cars and forced those who hesitated, with violence, out of the train and onto the ramp.”In painful detail, witnesses like Rudie S. Cortissos recited dates when the trains arrived, the number of people aboard and the names of prisoners. Mr. Cortissos said his mother arrived on May 21, 1943, with 2,300 others, mostly Dutch Jews who were immediately sent to the gas chambers.Defense lawyers argued that the Soviets had falsified Mr. Demjanjuk’s identity card and other documents, but a judge found a clear trail of evidence showing his path from Soviet prisoner to Sobibor guard. The court rejected arguments that he had no choice but to work in the camp, and concluded that it would have been impossible for a guard there not to have been part of the Nazi death machinery.Evidence at the trial also filled in previously unknown details of Mr. Demjanjuk’s life between Sobibor and the end of the war. It showed that after Sobibor was shut down in 1943, Mr. Demjanjuk served in a Ukrainian unit that fought alongside the Germans, was captured by American forces in 1945 and was sent to the displaced persons camp where he met and married the woman who was to share his odyssey.The Munich case might well have been the last major war crimes trial in Germany, ending an era that began in Nuremberg in 1945. As survivors and defendants have aged and died, the prosecution of Nazi-era war criminals has become increasingly rare and difficult.And the elusiveness lies not only in the distance of the past, as Justice Meir Shamgar of the Israeli Supreme Court said in striking down Mr. Demjanjuk’s conviction. “This was the proper course for judges who cannot examine the heart and the mind, but have only what their eyes see and read,” he wrote. “The matter is closed — but not complete. The complete truth is not the prerogative of the human judge.”'"
"'12-03-18,'0','BEIJING — Thousands of Tibetans took to the streets of a city in China’s northwest Qinghai Province on Saturday after the death of a farmer who set himself on fire at a Buddhist religious site, according to Tibetan exile groups. It was the second large protest in Qinghai this week.The gathering at the Rongwo Gonchen Monastery in Tongren, said to exceed 6,000 people, according to activist groups, was the biggest public protest in China’s traditionally Tibetan areas in recent years and a sign that the spate of self-immolations and demonstrations were spreading beyond the northern wedge of Sichuan Province where most of the unrest — and many of the previous 28 self-immolations — has taken place since last March.Free Tibet, a group based in London, said it was the most significant act of defiance against the Chinese government since 2008, when rioting in Lhasa, the capital of the Tibet Autonomous Region, shook the Communist Party leadership and prompted a crackdown in the remote high-altitude plateau that is home to five million ethnic Tibetans.On Friday, at least 1,000 people protested at a government building in Tongde County, not far from Tongren.“What we’re seeing is unprecedented, with more and more people willing to take significant risks,” said Stephanie Brigden, director of Free Tibet.'"
"'12-03-18,'0','It could have been 1955 again. At the Paper Mill Playhouse in Millburn, it was the opening night of a new production of “Damn Yankees,” and the orchestra began the overture. Those familiar songs — “Heart” (“miles and miles and miles of heart”), “Whatever Lola Wants,” “Goodbye, Old Girl” — were instant reminders of why this Faustian baseball musical won seven Tony Awards 56 years ago. This is a first-rate, frequently thrilling revival, even if it does have one disappointing flaw. But that comes later.The curtain goes up on two characters who would surely describe themselves as an old married couple. Joe Boyd (Joseph Kolinski), whose waistline and blood pressure have seen better days, is engrossed in a televised baseball game, in which his team, the Washington Senators, is losing to the New York Yankees. His wife, Meg (Patti Cohenour), begins singing “Six Months Out of Every Year,” a baseball widow’s lament.It would be just another evening at home if Joe didn’t say (to himself, he thinks), “I’d sell my soul for one long-ball hitter.” In an instant, with a firecracker pop and a puff of smoke, a certain Mr. Applegate (Howard McGillin), a k a Satan, appears at his door and offers just such an arrangement. He turns Joe into Joe Hardy (Christopher Charles Wood), a young, strong, handsome ballplayer with supernatural athletic abilities. And when Mr. Wood joins his older self in “Goodbye, Old Girl,” you could be forgiven for thinking that his gorgeous singing voice was a result of a pact with the Devil, too.The Senators are skeptical about this unknown rookie, even after they’ve seen Joe Hardy hit, but Applegate will not be deterred. Joe joins the team, and the season turns around immediately. The only catch is that once the Senators win the pennant, Joe has to accompany Applegate to hell and spend eternity there. Unless he exercises the escape clause, which Applegate arranges to make almost impossible.Mark S. Hoebee has directed with humor and imagination, and he has pretty spectacular material to work with.'"
"'12-03-18,'0','The day’s second-highest sale was also a Porsche, but not from the Drendel collection. A 1955 550/1500 sold for $3,245,000, handily topping its presale estimate of $2.2 million to $2.6 million. “The best-of-the-best examples are bringing more, and sometimes multiples of what might be expected,” said David Gooding, president of the auction house. “This is not the case of one or two bidders dominating the market. Many of our recent bidders are either new to us or new to the game.”While its cosmetic condition was not the “best of the best,” a 1956 Mercedes-Benz 300SL Gullwing brought $715,000, a touch over its $700,000 low estimate. At the lower end of the price scale, a 1970 Volkswagen Karmann-Ghia convertible sold for $25,300, or $300 above its low estimate.On Saturday, RM Auctions returned to the grounds of the Ritz-Carlton for a one-day sale, its 14th at Amelia Island. The top seller was a 1929 Cord L-29 known as the Hayes Coupe, after the Grand Rapids, Mich., company that made its custom body. With strong interest from bidders in the room and over the phone, the car sold for $2.42 million. The Hayes Coupe, which had sold for nearly $1.1 million at a 2008 Gooding auction at Pebble Beach, Calif., carried a presale estimate of $1.2 million to $1.5 million.Phil Neff, the operations director for the Elegance at Hershey, a concours in Pennsylvania, was enthusiastic about the Hayes Coupe. “It’s one of the few American cars that was shown in, and won, European concours” when it was new, he said. “It beat the likes of Delage, Bugatti and Delahaye on their home turf.”RM also claimed auction-record prices for three models: $1.21 million for a 1965 Aston Martin DB5 Vantage convertible, $363,000 for a 1973 Ferrari Dino 246GTS and $990,000 for a 1960 Mercedes-Benz 300SL roadster. Six cars at RM sold for more than $1 million.The Mercedes, a black car with green leather interior, was recently restored by a specialist in the marque, Rudi & Company of Victoria, British Columbia. Equipped with a factory hardtop and Rudge knock-off-style wheels, the car was presented as complete, down to its tool kit.A second 300SL, this one a silver 1957 model, went unsold for a high bid of $625,000.A complete set of 30 glass radiator ornaments by René Lalique, dating to the early 20th century, sold for $805,000, barely above the low end of the presale estimate of $800,000-$1.2 million.Other sales at RM included a 1959 Chrysler Imperial Crown hardtop sedan with Copper Spice metallic paint. Selling for $33,000 including buyers’ fees, the wildly flamboyant Imperial, designed by Virgil Exner, was among the few cars at the sale that changed hands for less than $40,000.'"

"'12-03-18,'0','Nrityagram was founded in 1990 as a gurukul, or residential village of learning, by the actress Protima Bedi. Though she died in 1998, her name is constantly invoked here. Her vivid personality and love affairs were one part of her legend, but another was her commitment to Indian classical dance, and in particular Odissi, of which she became by all accounts a compelling exponent. In essence Nrityagram remains as she had hoped: an idyllic place where it is not unusual for people to dance — usually with live musicians — morning, noon, and night.India has no fewer than eight genres of dance that have been officially deemed classical (as well as innumerable folk forms). The country’s complex political and social history, however, brought most of these forms close to extinction by the 1950s. Most of these idioms were connected to female temple dancers known as devadasis, a legendary caste surrounded in moral controversies (some were concubines, some were vowed to chastity, some dwindled into prostitution) and now virtually defunct. Though the classical dance forms today have become well established again, they’ve been extensively reconstructed — and inevitably altered — during the last century.Odissi, which came the closest to oblivion, derives from the state of Orissa on India’s east coast; Karnataka, including Nrityagram, is southwest and largely inland. As a result a few Orissan purists assert that Nrityagram detaches the dance form from its home culture. The truth, however, is that the village’s inception coincided with the worldwide spread of Odissi as a boom dance industry.What’s special about Odissi? Its most distinguishing features are its sensuous shifts of weight (creating a series of S-bend curves primarily at knee, torso, and neck), its rhythmic phrasing and its connection to ancient sculptural depictions of dance. Like many of the traditional dance forms of Southeast Asia it derives from the Natya Shastra, the treatise on the performing arts written between 200 B.C. and A.D. 200. Three weeks after leaving Nrityagram I saw, in the caves at Udaigiri in Orissa state, the oldest depiction of Odissi: a striking bas-relief, dating from about the first century A.D., of a female dancer backed by musicians. And the spectacular seventh-century temple at Konark has a Hall of Dance whose bas-relief depictions of dance are another prime source.Many of these bas-reliefs bear a point-for-point resemblance to the way today’s Odissi dancers move. Yet this ancient form is also a new one. Though once its greatest exponents were the devadasis, their art had dwindled largely to music making by the early 20th century. A separate Odissi lineage was (and remains) that of the gotipuas, boys trained until puberty to dance women’s roles and to perform acrobatic feats and tableaus (it was startling to see two of these troupes rehearsing in Orissa), and a third Odissi strain was a folk tradition. Core features have been codified only in living memory and are still subject to debate.Certainly Odissi’s range and rich beauties deserve to be called classical. Like several other classical forms in India, it has large capacities both for pure form (nritta) and for poetically dramatic expression (abhinaya). At Nrityagram it’s spellbinding, in the abhinaya sections, to watch the dancers’ facial mobility and rapt gestural communicativeness.What is classicism? The question often occurs in India. For Westerners classicism (in dance, but also in music and other arts) is a system of beliefs connecting the human and the ideal. Its external features have undergone Darwinian evolution to often drastic degrees. (Nobody in today’s classical ballet would consult pictures of Louis XIV’s era for practical guidance.) For the Indians classicism, intimately linked with the spirit of national independence, and also to the pride of individual states, is a way of touching base with a tradition that existed before Western and other colonial invasions.The production coming to the United States is a joint project, yoking Nrityagram dancers and musicians with a guru, choreographer, drummer and two dancers from the Chitrasena Dance Company from Colombo, Sri Lanka. (The Kandyan dances of Sri Lanka, which the Chitrasena performers practice, form yet another of the many genres of the Indian subcontinent.) The production, called “Samhara,” is a remarkably subtle dialogue between the two styles. Both Surupa Sen, the dancer and choreographer who is Nrityagram’s artistic director, and her fellow dancer Bijayini Satpathy, director of Nrityagram’s Odissi Gurukul, told me that they had encountered no other dance company with which they feel in such harmony as that of Chitrasena. They refer to it as a masculine counterpart to the essentially feminine Odissi style.The Chitrasena company, like the Nrityagram one, is internationally celebrated. It was founded in Colombo in 1944 by the guru Chitrasena, whose real name was Amaratunga Arachige Maurice Dias; he also founded its school. Chitrasena, who died in 2005, and his wife, Vajira, were renowned dancers; their daughter Upeka, who retired from performance last year, is currently its guru (source of enlightenment) and has been commuting between Colombo and Nrityagram for several months.At first you wonder why the Nrityagram dancers call the Chitrasena style masculine. The two Sri Lankan dancers involved in this project are remarkably lovely, slender, and long-limbed young women. Soon, however, the difference between their idiom and the Nrityagram one becomes obvious. The Chitrasena women cover much more space than the Odissi dancers, both in the easy vertical lift of their limbs and in their horizontal traveling. They also move their arms, wrists and torsos in different ways; and they show few of the meltingly sensuous horizontal curves that are central to Odissi. They also show facial enthusiasm with broad smiles, whereas the Nrityagram dancers, like most Indian classical stylists, maintain facial composure in passages of pure dance form (while using vividly changing facial expressions in formally expressional sequences).And where Odissi dancers wear a chain of bells twined three times around the ankle, the Chitrasena dancers wear bronze anklets with internal bells, attached both to ankle and second toe. (It was fascinating later to see such an anklet depicted in a centuries-old sculpture in the temple at Madurai, in the Indian southeast state of Tamil Nadu.) After watching a rehearsal or two I could certainly identify the ways in which the Nrityagram and Chitrasena dancers differ. I could also see where they come close to each other, like a meeting of finely attuned minds. What I couldn’t see, however, was where the dancers took anything specific from each other’s style. So I asked.The answer was rhythm. Here, admittedly, the Western ear passes into mystery; Indian and Sri Lankan traditional music customarily uses meters of a complexity that perplexes many trained Western musicians and bewilders most Western dance lovers.One evening at Nrityagram I watched the two Sri Lankan dancers, Thaji Dias (a granddaughter of Chitrasena) and Mithilani Munasingha, working for hours with their choreographer, Heshma Wignaraja, and with three of the Nrityagram musicians to perfect their rhythmic command of these syllabic dances (“Takateeta deena, Takateeta deena, Takateeta deen” is how one phrase sounds) in Odissi meter. The vocalist and violinist were as involved in the syllables as were the drummer and dancers.Likewise, at other times the Odissi dancers absorb Sri Lankan rhythm. Watching them at another rehearsal I noted that even a seemingly slow-motion phrase is set to a passage of brisk drumming. It seemed that, within the gradual movement, there was a rapid sequence of minor pulsations, each to be fitted with intense precision into the dance.A Western observer begins by finding everything in Indian dance “other”; when I first watched it in London in 1980, I thought I had no vocabulary, no frame of reference, for what I saw. What becomes absorbing, however, in Indian dance — not least the Odissi form of Nrityagram — is that it contains multiple othernesses. These Indian dances abound in dualisms: masculine and feminine elements (even within the “feminine” Odissi), sculptural qualities and sinuous transitions, abstract form and mime gesture, motion and repose. The contrasts within the idiom make for endless expressiveness.'"
"'12-03-18,'0','Clement seems to be through with many things. He survived a terrible ordeal by fire during the war, which has left much of his body scarred; he walks feebly and uses a cane. Though lucky to be alive, he thinks himself repellent, ugly “in the way that a few prominent cracks in a ceramic vase ruin it entirely.” He has numbed himself to hope, though he takes great care to dress handsomely, “with almost excruciating attention.”Who would be attracted to him? No matter. He is relieved to be “excused from love and marriage and all the preliminary and subsequent complications and mortifications they involved.” The dead tissue stretched across his body is hard and dry, senseless. “And then he would touch a patch of skin that had been spared, and the silken softness of it, the electric thrill of the feeling, seemed an even worse shock.” His best friend since they were schoolboys, Robin Lofting, still loves him, with “an almost unbearable pain.” But their love is impossible, so Robin has married.This is hardly the most welcoming of households for a lost soul like Coral. Naturally timid, she is frequently bewildered and frustratingly passive in the face of small, commonplace humiliations. But even unspeakable violence can’t penetrate her haze. Like Clement, she has numbed herself from mortifications too soon visited on a tender young life, for Coral has been ill used. The novel follows her quiet but steady journey out of, as Trollope put it, “a lifeless life.”Small things unhinge her nervous placidity. She buys a lavender silk dress, though “to try to look beautiful, which effort implied a belief that one could achieve beauty, made her feel uneasy.” When she tries it on in her room, she realizes she can’t do up the zipper and hooks at the back. “It seemed very cruel to design a dress that the wearer could not don independently.” The problem with the dress is the problem with her life. Coral drifts into compromising situations — and panics. She feels trapped; she can’t think.Some readers may want to yank Coral’s dress over her shoulders, shake some sense into her and shove her on her way. One can only hope that such readers never become psychoanalysts. Healthy minds are not Cameron’s subject. This is a book of delicate sensibilities. Cameron’s characters are in danger of defeat almost as soon as they set out. “It is too exhausting, what people expect,” thinks Coral — whose problem, more often than not, is that she can’t bring herself to actually say what she thinks.Cameron’s patient, painstaking concern is with the fog banks of neuroses, in which even the most inconsequential gesture settles, like a heavy woolen blanket, over an aching heart. He writes about an unbearable, smothering sadness that renders even violence dully prosaic. But it would be a mistake — one everybody in Coral’s life seems to have made, including herself — to think that because a person is undemanding, even yielding to whatever abuse is visited on her, she doesn’t want, desperately, to be loved.There is a forest near the house in which Coral works, a mysterious place where she thinks she hears someone crying. But it is “just the weird sawing of the holly leaves, chafing in the wind.” The woods are cut through with paths leading to places that hint at different worlds — a churchyard, an overgrown garden, water meadows, an abandoned aerodrome. Although the woods aren’t large, Coral senses that there is “a feeling of isolation in the center of them.” As there is in her life.Everyone in this novel has occasion to spill copious but silent tears. They don’t weep in vain — and that’s the story’s saving grace. Through almost imperceptible movement, these people find, in the forest of their daily experience, a clearing. And if they’re lucky, they even find a path through its dark heart.Those tear flasks remained unpainted until their owners experienced the death of a loved one. “Thou tellest my wanderings,” the Old Testament says. “Put thou my tears into thy bottle: are they not in thy book?” This gracious novel tells of one soul’s wanderings. But Coral Glynn’s tears of calamity are, finally, bottled. In Cameron’s novel, pain becomes the scrollwork etched across memory, a surface decoration of the vessel that is one small, foolish, buoyant life. There is always hope.'"

"'12-03-19,'1','This is a longer and still far from perfect post in response to the recent OpEd in the Times.   Sorry my original one had so many typos but I was rushing to post something before leaving on a few day vacation with my family, which I am still on…Revised from the post on WEDNESDAY.I read the OpEd in the New York Times upon waking early, very early, to get some work done before heading off on a short vacation with my family. I don’t know the author Greg Smith, nor do I know anyone who knows him personally. I do know a lot of people who have worked, and do work, at Goldman Sachs. I am a former partner (left in 2002), as is my husband Greg (left in 2000), and I have many close friends who are or have been partners as well. Needless to say, there has been a flurry of emails and phone calls regarding what Mr. Smith has said so very publicly. I also went online and read many of the articles that have been written in response. Talk about a diversity of opinions!Who am I to challenge what Mr. Smith has said? Based on his background, he certainly seems like a credible guy. He has worked at Goldman for 12 years, has a big title and more. I have known many disgruntled employees and none have ever done something like this. None. For that reason alone I felt I had to pay attention. As a rule, I love people who are really brave and I really dislike people who are passive aggressive. Only Mr. Smith knows which one he is. So although I am not directly challenging Mr. Smith, I did work at the firm for 14 years, was the youngest woman and first woman trader to be made partner in 1996, and served on multiple committees for the firm including the firm’s partnership committee, and thus want to weigh in. That committee was, and I believe still is, responsible for all of Goldman’s people practices, had as members many management committee members and business line heads, and reported to the board of directors in some form. That said, I did leave the firm in 2002, which, my children point out, is a very long time ago.I joined Goldman Sachs in 1988 as an analyst in mortgage trading. I, like Mr. Smith, appeared in recruiting videos and annual reports, spoke on college campuses and recruited actively. As the first woman trader to be made partner at the age of 32, I was almost a ‘poster child’ for diversity, meritocracy, and more. I gave countless speeches to thousands over my 14-year career at the firm. When I spoke so positively about the firm, it was because I believed what I was saying. My reviews were always outstanding in both the commercial and culture sense and that is why I believe I was promoted so young. Though I left my trading position 12 years ago, I will tell you from personal experience that the vast majority of people I worked with cared deeply about our customers, and, if you were heard calling customers any of the things Mr. Smith mentioned, you would be in big trouble. BIG.More relevant is that if you continuously ‘ripped your customers eyeballs out’, they would cease to be your customers. The behavior that Mr. Smith so graphically describes was, at the time, the exception and not the norm in my opinion. Were we supposed to make money? Yes. If you promoted that this came at the customer’s expense, that was a bad thing. At that time sales managers called on accounts regularly to check in regarding their feelings on the level of service they were receiving from their salesperson and traders. If you were not doing a good job, you heard about it. These sales managers were senior people and had power, as did the traders. That balance made for responsible behavior. Traders in general pushed to make money and the salespeople pushed to keep their customers happy. I believed in a win/win approach and, more often than not, that was the case. If that were not the case, I don’t believe Goldman would have been as successful as they have been for so long.That was 12 years ago. The questions now are: has the business changed and has the firm changed? I think the answer to both is yes.First, how has the business changed? I believe there is, in general, a climate of greater suspicion. Firms like Goldman and others have large proprietary positions that can never, in my opinion, be divorced from providing liquidity for customers. This is not in and of itself a negative, as it can be argued that having large positions can help facilitate large customer trades. On the other hand, traders can use customer information to do things like ‘front run’, which is unethical. Traders cannot do their jobs by just bidding and offering securities to their customers without having positions.  This is what the public and government regulators do not seem to understand.  That has been the way traders have operated for DECADES.  You have to take positions and, in fact, your customers should, in general, want you to.  Their job as customers is in part to figure out who on the street has positions in what they want to buy so they can ask you to make an offering. Conversely, if they want to sell something, the best buyer is likely the one who is short that security.   This is where a talented salesperson comes in who has a long-term relationship with the client. That person helps to bridge the divide between what his client may want and what his trading desk is positioned to do. The most common question asked every single day to me for 10 years as a trader was: ‘what is your axe?’ Meaning what are you the best buyer or seller of today? What this does is allow the salesperson to go to his client and let him or her know what her trader wants to do and thus become the best buyer or seller of. This is called a win/win.  This approach worked when there was relationship and that relationship was based on telling the truth.I know this is a very long paragraph but I believe that there is so much misunderstanding about the business and it makes me nuts.   Bottom line: if people don’t trust each other, none of this works.  Our financial system is built on TRUST and if that trust breaks, really breaks, look out.  Game over.Another major change over the past 10 to 15 years is that customers have become huge and do huge trades. In my day, a $100 million trade was big; now trades can be in the billions. Many customers are much bigger than the firms they trade with. Mr. Smith himself says he works with customers that have total assets of over a trillion dollars. Further, there never used to be so many mega hedge funds. Hedge funds are not good or bad, but my experience has been that they are less open to sharing information. They trust the street less. They are truly paid on how much money they make, more so then the average street trader or institutional customer. In discussion with many a hedge fund manager, they often say ‘we treat Goldman and any other firm like another hedge fund.’ In other words, we don’t trust them, think they are only out to make money for them.  Which came first, the chicken or the egg?I have heard many in the business ask this troubling question about the current state of affairs, ‘who is a customer anyways?’ Wow. Back in 2000 when I left trading, the lines were starting to get blurred but now it seems that the lines may be gone altogether.  It used to be that, generally speaking, both sides of the trade cared about the relationship as it was in their mutual best interest to care over the long term; both needed each other for liquidity, ideas and more.  When everyone starts seeing each other as competitors, that is a big problem.  The goal ceases to be one of building relationship and becomes instead to win.  Not to be overly dramatic here but think about war crimes for a second.  How do people justify doing what they do to other people?  They stop seeing them as human beings. How does the street perhaps justify what they are doing?  They are not clients. And vice versa.Let me give you an example. It is not uncommon, I am told, for a trader to be asked to sell a large block of bonds, hundreds of millions, only to learn that many other dealers were asked to do so at the very same time resulting in instantaneous losses and an inability to buy back what you sold or anything else that might provide a hedge for that sale. Such ‘customers’ are not innocent victims but the opposite. Is it right for that trader to no longer be transparent with that customer? Yes.  The vicious cycle of mistrust begins. In the old days we knew which customers could not be trusted and we adjusted our prices accordingly but traders often found themselves in a ‘catch 22.’  When the next trade came, they would adjust their prices expecting to get bamboozled and then the client would often scream bloody murder about how much the trader ‘sucked.’  The opposite could easily happen as well.  A salesperson would give the trader a ‘heads-up’ that the client was thinking about doing a big trade based on their relationship and the trader could inappropriately jump ahead of it.  The client would figure this out, accuse the salesperson who would then accuse the trade and bingo, trust broken.  My point is, at the end of the day, TRUST is what makes it all work.  Without that, you have nothing.Firms like Goldman do not make money on every trade, and it is not as one-sided as Mr. Smith makes it out to be.  Did I ever ask the question of my traders ‘how much money did you make on that trade?’  Of course, and that was my job as desk manager, but again, it is not so black and white.  Making money might have meant a smart and hard-working trader bought a block of securities at a low price months earlier and worked hard to tell the story of why that security was so undervalued before selling it to an educated client because he/she thought it would go up even more.  A more common example is that a trader positioned herself long before an economic announcement, then the market went up and that trader was given an opportunity to sell a block of bonds to a customer at the most competitive price.Please don’t read this as poor Wall Street firms and big bad customers, that is NOT what I am saying, but the discourse has been so skewed and should be at least partially rebalanced. There are huge issues on BOTH sides of the equation.Is this all to say that clients do not get “their eyeballs ripped out?”  No, they certainly can and do but institutional clients are, in my experience, smart too. They usually quickly figure out that they’re getting ripped off and will stop doing business with that trader and salesperson.  I know the whole ‘buyer beware’ thing can be an excuse for a lot, but we are talking about institutional clients and not ‘Mom and Pop’.  Also, in my day, if the client felt they were being ripped off they would call their salesperson first, then the sales manager, and often the head of the division.  It was not uncommon for the sales manager and department head to march over to a trader to talk about a ‘situation.’ This was not a good thing. At the end of the day, the trader had to care about the customer and not just about making money because it was in their best self-interest to do so.Notice I am not going to that dark place of talking about sub-prime mortgages, CDOs, CDOs squared, credit derivatives and more. That is an essay in and of itself and really not the point of Mr. Smith’s article. So much junk was created that should never have been with disastrous consequences and that will be a black mark on the whole industry for a long time, as it should be. That in and of itself is testimony to the industry in general having lost its way. When you create toxic waste and market it as if it is was not, you are indeed harming your moral fiber. I know many people who were in ‘that business’ who quit because they could not in good faith sell the crap they were being asked to create and market. Too many people leaned on the ‘buyer beware’ clause and forgot to look in the mirror. As per the war crime example above, they stopped treating their customer like a customer.Next question: Is Goldman Sachs, as Mr. Smith says, on a serious decline with respect to their moral fiber? I cannot answer that from my personal experience of late, but I will say that the Goldman Sachs I joined in 1988 was not the same one I left in 2002 from a culture perspective. That is one of the reasons I left too. When you put your values out there so publicly you better damn well honor them. No one wants to intentionally be a hypocrite. This was the big point in Mr. Smith’s article. As long as he believed what he was saying, all good. When he stopped believing it, he had to leave.So what was my story? In my later years at Goldman I was promoted to a position wihin the Executive Office where I was responsible at some level for the people processes of the firm. As mentioned, I served on the Partnership Committee, which was a HUGE honor. I witnessed people getting promoted who were not positive ‘culture carriers’, and I knew exactly where people were ranked and what was said about them by their bosses, peers and more.  I also knew what every managing director got paid. I sat and listened to arguments about how commercial people HAD to be promoted despite being poor team players, downright jerks or much more. That really pissed me off.I also heard business leaders fight passionately for their people who were amazing positive culture carriers and less strong commercially. These same leaders fought against promoting the commercial animal/jerks and often won. That made me happy.  For both categories of people, there was frequently a fight and the more powerful leaders’ candidate often won. Not surprisingly, partners who were great culture carriers generally had people working for them who were as well and vice versa.  What made the firm GREAT for so long is that one held the other in check. You need people who are very commercial but they cannot dominate or you risk the outcome that Mr. Smith described.During my time at the firm, there were a lot of people in that optimal category who were both great commercially and culturally, and those were the people who were quickly and unequivocally promoted. If you were to ask me, ‘did people get promoted who should not should not have?’, I would say yes. There was always tension but, more often then not, the right decisions were made. Great people got deservedly promoted. Was it perfect? Of course not, but it was pretty damn good.Many people over the past few years have told me that Goldman has increasingly become tilted towards the money side at the cost of the firm’s character. I cannot tell you the number of times I have heard ‘Goldman is not the place it was’ and that truly breaks my heart. Mr. Smith was right in saying that a trajectory of descent occurs over time when more and more people are promoted who are not good culture carriers. It that is the case, then correcting this will also take time by weeding out the toxic people, and promoting ones who are BOTH commercially and customer-oriented.The Goldman Sachs of my memory was indeed a very special place and was recognized as such in countless ways over decades and decades. It was the professional home of not only some of the smartest people I have ever met, but the most generous and kind as well. Books were written about Goldman’s culture because it was great, it was different, and I am sure that the firm’s founders and historical leaders would be devastated by the article that was written, as was I.  A person who comes to mind is John Whitehead, one of the most ethical and service oriented human beings to ever walk the planet. I would like to know what he thinks at this moment.I also have to make this point: Mr. Smith likely does not know even the tiniest fraction of the 30,000 something people who work at the firm, the majority of whom are a long way from the trading floor in Europe or anywhere else. The vast majority of people do their job in a deeply respectful way. It is just not right or fair to paint all people who work at Goldman, or Morgan Stanley, or any other firm with the same brush. Most don’t make a million dollars a year and most are not ‘masters of the universe.’  Most are just normal, good people who chose a career in finance when that was a really acceptable thing to do.  It seems to me that Mr. Smith is really speaking to the ‘five different managing directors’ who he has had deep interaction with and the upward chain of command that promoted them to those positions. Maybe he is also talking about the trading businesses in general but he is certainly not talking about the 1,200 people who live and work in Salt Lake City? Has he ever even been there?So what now? Will this article have consequences? I hope so. These are very serious accusations from a credible person in my view and I hope it does indeed provide a ‘wake-up’  (quote from Mr.  Smith’s piece) call to the board of directors. It is their responsibility to ensure that promotion and compensation decisions are not divorced from peer reviews and customer feedback. It is their responsibility to ensure that traders, and especially ones who do not have the best interests of clients in mind, do not dominate the firm. It is the board that is accountable to the shareholders and before they take another paycheck, I hope they ask a heck of a lot of questions and get honest answers. If those answers do not reflect the kind of behavior reported by Mr. Smith, then they would have done their job, this story will fade, and Goldman will go about its business for another 143 years. If the answers are the opposite, there should be accountability.I am not defending Goldman nor am I attacking them. I just cannot as it is just way too personal for me. At times, in private conversation, I can be their most passionate supporter, and at other moments, their worst critic. Both come from a place of wanting Goldman to be what it was, and what it could and should be. Thoughts of parenting come to mind.I am so grateful to Goldman as it was there I met my husband, it was there that I developed quality relationships that have lasted decades, it was there I learned so much about myself, it was there I was made a partner before the firm went public, and it was there that ignited my passion for the advancement of women and girls. On the other hand, I do believe that the firm has changed and perhaps lost hold of the business principles that made it so great and so special for so very long.This I know to be true: If you promote people into leadership roles who are bad people, the outcomes will be bad over the long term. If you promote people who are all about their paycheck, the culture will be all about the paycheck. The opposite is true as well.  Has Goldman become full of bad people who really only care about money, money, money? I will leave that to the board of directors to figure out. I sure hope not.To Mr. Smith: If what you described in your OpEd was indeed your honest and unembellished personal experience, you were right to quit, and it was very brave to put yourself out there. If not, and you are a disgruntled employee who wants his moment in the sun, shame on you. Either way, as you did currently state, without clients they will not make money, or at least make a heck of a lot less.In the words of Forest Gump: “And that’s all I have to say about that.”'"

"'12-03-19,'1','“I’m glad that he’s married, and has been married to the same person for a long time and has children,” said Dawn Parker, 51, a secretary from Freeport, Ill. “As a woman, I like that. I like that he’s a family man, a father and a grandfather.”Still, Ms. Parker said that she had not yet made up her mind for the primary on Tuesday, but that Mr. Romney was “a possibility.”While women are hardly monolithic in their politics, the Romney campaign is urgently trying to shift the conversation back to the economy from more divisive social issues.That effort was on full display as Mrs. Romney traveled across Illinois with her husband on Sunday. She concluded her speech here in Moline with a direct plea: “We need you. We all need you in November, too. We have to remember why we’re upset and what we’ve got to do to fix things.”Mr. Romney’s speech on Sunday morning — which also focused on the economy, the animating force of his campaign — was more subtle, as he talked about families being hurt by the rising cost of gasoline.“You’ve got moms that are driving their kids to school and practice after school and other appointments, and wonder how they can afford putting gasoline in the car, at the same time putting food on the table night after night,” he said. “This president doesn’t understand the economy.“He’s an economic lightweight, and he’s made decisions that have hurt the American people.”This was not the first time that Mrs. Romney had overtly reached out to women. The campaign understands her potential for wooing women, and it had previously used her, in Iowa, to offer an implicit contrast between her 42-year marriage to Mr. Romney and Newt Gingrich’s marital history.In a speech in Boston on March 6, Super Tuesday, where the discussion leading up to the contests in the 10 states that day had been heavily dominated by issues of contraception, Mrs. Romney addressed the women she said she had been hearing from “all across this country.”“Do you know what women care about — and this is what I love — women care about jobs,” Mrs. Romney said at the time. “Women care about the economy, they care about their children, and they care about the debt.“And they’re angry. They’re furious about the entitlement debt that we’re leaving our children.”She concluded: “So this is what we’re hearing when we’re out there — this is our message. It’s an economic message, it’s about the future for our children, and that’s what I’m hearing out there.”'"
"'12-03-19,'1','Labor reform has long been a third rail in Italy, where unions, business groups and countless governments have invested in the status quo to protect their constituents, at the expense of economic growth. Without such changes, experts say, Italy is headed toward an economic and social implosion, with a rise in under-the-table work and a looming pension crunch, now that Italy bases pensions on years of social security contributions and not a worker’s final salary at retirement age.Economists say that Italy’s employment rate and productivity have been stunted by high labor costs and that lowering the cost of firing workers and increasing protections for shorter-term contracts would encourage companies to hire, stimulating growth.“Reforming contracts, unemployment benefits and salary levels would permit labor productivity to rise, which would in turn permit the country to grow,” said Tito Boeri, an economist at Bocconi University in Milan. “It is a central theme for improving a country like Italy.”Italy is already in recession, and its economy is expected to contract by 2.2 percent this year, according to the International Monetary Fund. Mr. Monti, a technocrat appointed in November to turn around Italy’s flagging economy, said from the outset that he intended to recalibrate the system.“We have to get away from a dual labor market where some are overly protected, while others totally lack protection and benefits when unemployed,” the prime minister said shortly after taking office. He said that “equity and growth” would be the watchwords of his government, and that he aimed to increase employment among young people and women.Such changes would be welcomed by Ms. Linza, who, like so many in her generation, feels thwarted, overly reliant on her parents and uncertain of her future. She once dreamed of working with autistic children, but started at a call center when she could not find work in her field. She is currently on a semipaid furlough, which she went on after her company moved its operations outside Rome, where labor costs are lower.“My father can’t believe how his 30-year-old daughter, who got her degree at age 23” — young by Italian standards — “is unemployed, while he, with a fifth-grade education, in 1970 won a state competition and could choose between becoming a policeman or working for the state railway,” Ms. Linza said.Her father took early retirement in the mid-1990s from his job as an electrical technician in the southern region of Calabria, where the family is from. The state railway company, Ferrovie dello Stato, offered early retirement with full pensions to many workers as a way of reducing its staff and cutting costs in the period before Italy joined the euro zone.It is the prospect of having to pay for these golden parachutes — known as “buon uscite,” or “good exits” — when they let workers go that makes employers afraid to hire them for full-time positions in the first place. Instead, Italian companies today are quick to hire younger workers on a range of temporary contracts and internships that the Italian government created nearly a decade ago to make the market more flexible. Those changes resulted in the two-tiered system.The most delicate topic on Mr. Monti’s agenda is the infamous Article 18 of the Italian labor statute of the 1970s, long a sticking point in labor talks. It states that workers cannot be fired without just cause and, if fired, can sue their companies to be reinstated — cases they generally win in Italy’s employee-friendly courts. While such cases are pending in the notoriously slow legal system, companies are required to keep fired workers on the payroll, a system that critics say rewards the clever at the expense of a company’s solvency.Last week, Mr. Monti held talks with the party leaders supporting his coalition in an effort to reach a consensus on the issue before completing the measures to be put to a vote in Parliament. In a statement after the meeting, the government said it was working to simplify labor contracts and revise the norms governing layoffs, “distinguishing between firing for discriminatory reasons, for disciplinary and for exclusively economic reasons.”Mr. Boeri, the economist, said that some of the proposed changes to Article 18 appeared to be a compromise that would satisfy neither workers, because protections would be reduced, nor employers, because some laid-off workers could still sue to be reinstated. “This reform risks being” something “which changes everything in order not to change anything,” he said.Labor unions in particular have said that changes to labor laws would affect the entire economy and society. For instance, today, Italy’s conservative banks will not approve mortgages for most middle-class borrowers unless they have a guaranteed contract, an issue that has not been resolved in talks.Mr. Monti’s labor overhaul is something of a make-or-break moment for Italian labor unions, which still hold sway over negotiating national labor contracts and have held a series of demonstrations against the changes. But today, the unions represent more retirees than workers, and younger Italians have come to see them as part of the problem.“I am sorry that the unions are desperate, I am sorry that people in their 60s are desperate because they raised the pension age,” said Eleonora Voltolina, who edits the Web site Republic of Interns, which calls attention to young people’s plight in the Italian labor market. “But we’re a generation that won’t even see a pension.“They don’t realize there’s a system that’s falling apart. I hope the government goes ahead like a tank and doesn’t hold back on this.”The reason the system has not yet fallen apart is simple. “The Italian state took advantage of the fact that the family is the welfare state,” Ms. Voltolina said. “There is no cultural barrier to an Italian family maintaining a kid of 20, 30 or 40 years old.”Ms. Linza and her husband, who works as a nurse, now have a mortgage to pay, which they got thanks to the help of their families. “For my generation there was the welfare of the parents,” she said. “My kids won’t have it because I don’t save any money. That’s when the revolution might start.”'"
"'12-03-19,'1','ATHENS — The finance minister of Greece, Evangelos Venizelos, assumed the leadership of the country’s embattled Socialist Party, known as Pasok, on Sunday as the country’s political parties prepared to face austerity-weary voters in a general election that is expected in late April or early May.Mr. Venizelos took the reins from George A. Papandreou, who was prime minister until his government fell at the height of the country’s financial crisis last November. Mr. Venizelos, who mounted a strong but unsuccessful challenge to Mr. Papandreou for the party leadership in 2007, was unopposed this time after two rivals failed to attract adequate backing to run. The leader is chosen by a vote of the party’s members and supporters in what amounts to a national primary.Mr. Venizelos was expected to give up his ministry post on Monday, either to one of his several deputies or to Prime Minister Lucas Papademos, following a formal handover of the party post from Mr. Papandreou.In a speech on Greek television shortly after the polls closed Sunday evening, Mr. Venizelos described the election as “a successful exercise in political readiness” and said that he would lead his party to “rebirth” and Greece to recovery. “Already, our country is at that crucial stage between the crisis and the now-palpable prospects for emerging from it,” he said.Pasok, for decades the largest party in Greece with 40 percent of the vote or more in most elections, has seen its support plummet since the financial crisis took hold. The party took most of the blame for the painful rounds of austerity measures enacted in exchange for aid and debt relief from foreign creditors. Many of the measures fell most harshly on important parts of Pasok’s political base — public-sector workers — and amid the bitter internal rancor over the measures, the party expelled several members of Parliament who broke ranks during voting.In the end, completing the aid and debt deals and passing a new national budget required the formation of a unity coalition with Pasok’s main rival, the conservative New Democracy Party, and the appointment of an interim prime minister, Mr. Papademos, who will leave office after the general election.'"
"'12-03-19,'1','On Tuesday, President will convene a special sitting of Parliament that aims to improve his government’s strained ties with the United States, which have been suspended since American warplanes killed 24 Pakistani troops on the Afghanistan border in November. Public outrage over the shooting capped a tumultuous year for the countries’ relationship, already rocked by a shooting by a C.I.A. contractor in Lahore and the commando raid that killed .“We want this relationship to be transparent and predictable,” said Sherry Rehman, Pakistan’s ambassador to Washington.American officials hope that the parliamentary debate will pave the way for a normalization of relations by early April, end a months-long blockade of supply lines through Pakistan and boost faltering efforts to draw the Afghan Taliban into peace talks. All those issues are critical to American plans to withdraw combat troops from Afghanistan in 2014. But signs are that the Pakistani debate will be dominated by strident calls for an end to drone strikes.“The drones are killing innocent bystanders, including children and women,” said Chaudhry Nisar Ali Khan, the leader of the opposition in Parliament, in an interview. “They must be stopped forthwith.”American officials say there is no question of grounding the unmanned aircraft, which have become a central weapon in the Obama administration’s counterterrorism arsenal. A senior American official in Washington said that the C.I.A. had consistently taken precautions to reduce the risk to civilians, and noted that some strikes had killed Pakistan’s insurgent enemies, too. “These efforts have been extremely precise and effective,” said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the program’s covert status.In North and South Waziristan, the tribal districts where 95 percent of about 265 strikes ordered by the Obama administration have occurred, the drones have sown fear and paranoia among Taliban fighters who, facing a technologically superior enemy, have adopted some unusual countermeasures.During an interview last month in Shawal, a thickly-forested district of plunging valleys that became a haven for Al Qaeda after 2001, a senior Taliban commander, Wali ur-Rehman, ordered his fighters to scan a newly arrived car with a camcorder. Mr. Rehman explained that the camera could somehow detect otherwise invisible signals from the “patrai” — local slang for small electronic tracking devices that, many tribesmen believe, guide American missiles to their target.“This is our new weapon,” said Mr. Rehman, who has a $5 million United States government bounty on his head, pointing to the camera. “It has saved a lot of lives.”Whether that was true is unclear, although a former C.I.A. official confirmed that the agency does use tracking devices to identify targets. Either way, Mr. Rehman’s camcorder served a gruesome secondary purpose: recording the last testimony of tribesmen accused of spying for the United States, dozens of whom have been tortured and executed. Yet that, too, was a sign of vulnerability.Another militant commander, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said that the killing of several innocent tribesmen by the Taliban’s “spy squads” had provoked discord in militant ranks over the past year, and led to a drop in summary executions.On the American side, the drone program is also evolving. The pace has relented, with 64 strikes recorded in 2011, down from 117 in 2010, according to the Long War Journal, a Web site that closely monitors the strikes. A lively debate inside the Obama administration last summer gave the State Department greater say in the strikes. The final say, however, still rests with , the C.I.A. director.The Afghan war also affects the program’s momentum. Gen. , the top allied commander in Afghanistan, now receives more timely information about C.I.A. strikes in Pakistan than he did just a few months ago, an American military official said. That allows the general’s commanders to direct attacks more effectively on the Afghan side of the border.In January, publicly acknowledged the covert program for the first time. “This thing is kept on a very tight leash,” he said.In Waziristan, though, many take those assurances with skepticism. On a visit to Islamabad last week, Noor Magul, a farmer from North Waziristan, spoke of his anger at the death of three relatives who were killed last Oct. 30 when a drone struck the car in which they were traveling. Naming the men as Khastar Gul, Mamrud Khan and Noorzal Khan, Mr. Magul insisted they had no militant links but worked in a local chromite mine.“I have revenge in my heart,” said the 64-year-old, fingering his ash-colored beard. “I just want to grab a drone by the tail and smash it into the ground.”Accounts of civilian casualties play a major role in Pakistani anger toward the drones. An extraordinary claim by President Obama’s top counterterrorism adviser, , last June that there had not been “a single collateral death” over the previous year drew an indignant response. The Bureau of Investigative Journalism, which monitors the toll, counted “credible media accounts” of between 63 and 127 nonmilitant deaths in 2011, and a recent Associated Press investigation found evidence that at least 56 villagers and tribal police had been killed in the 10 largest strikes since August 2010. But analysts, American officials and even many tribesmen agree the drones are increasingly precise. Of 10 strikes this year, the local news media have alleged civilian deaths in one case. The remainder of those killed — 58 people, by conservative estimates — were militants.“The overriding concern is to avoid collateral damage,” another senior United States official said.For diplomats on both sides, the drone issue has become the Rubik’s Cube of their relationship — a puzzle with no easy solution. “Things are at a very delicate point right now,” one senior United States official said.Some officials suggest that the diplomatic deadlock could be broken by sharing more information with Pakistan’s Directorate. But patience with Pakistan in Washington has been so low since the Bin Laden raid in May that such changes could be a tough sell in Congress, said Shamila N. Chaudhary, a former member of the .“It’s not in the U.S. interest to have a drone program with limits,” she said. “The administration wants utmost flexibility.”Whatever this week’s debate brings, many in Pakistan are cynical that it will change much. “I can tell you how all this will end,” said Aftab Ahmed Khan Sherpao, a former interior minister. “The Pakistani people will keep on protesting. And the drone strikes will keep taking place.”'"
"'12-03-19,'1','Home prices in China posted the worst performance in a year in February, the country’s National Bureau of Statistics said Sunday, with the prices in almost half of the cities monitored by the government falling from a year ago as China maintained curbs on the property market.Prices for new homes fell in 27 of 70 cities last month from a year earlier, and prices were unchanged in six cities, the bureau said in a statement on its Web site. That is the worst since, at the start of 2011, the government began releasing individual data for 70 cities instead of a national average.Prime Minister Wen Jiabao said last week that housing prices remained far from a reasonable level and called on the government not to let up in its efforts to regulate the home sector. Relaxing the curbs could cause chaos in the market, Mr. Wen said.China’s two-year campaign to rein in home prices has included measures like raising down payments and mortgage rates and restricting home purchase in 40 cities.'"
"'12-03-19,'1','The Cuomo administration said that enforcement was as vigorous as ever, and that Mr. Cox was on target to avoid $1.1 billion in improper Medicaid spending this year, even more than his predecessor. But veterans of Medicaid policing pointed to important audits that were started by Mr. Sheehan but have not been released, and said the inspector general’s office was at a difficult crossroads, caught between the Legislature’s allegiances to campaign contributors from the health care field and the governor’s plans to cut Medicaid costs, which depend on the goodwill of , hospitals and home health agencies.“An industry that’s regulated doesn’t love the regulator unless the regulator isn’t doing much,” said Arthur A. Levin, the longtime director of the Center for Medical Consumers, a nonprofit advocacy organization, who admired Mr. Sheehan. “Asking the regulator and the regulated party to sit down and come to some sort of consensus on how the regulation should be — to me, it makes no sense.”Michael A. Zegarelli, a past president of the national association of Medicaid oversight officials and a senior regulator in New York until 2003, said that by definition, an audit that found overbilling, fraud or waste was “going to be adversarial.”“Sheehan’s successor will have a short leash,” Mr. Zegarelli said. “Will that be for the benefit of the program, or to keep Cuomo’s constituency happy?”New York’s Medicaid program, jointly financed by federal, state and local taxpayers, is the nation’s largest, at $53 billion. In 2005, an investigation by found that Health Department regulators had uncovered only 37 cases of suspected fraud in 400 million annual claims, overlooking red flags like a storefront dentist whose billings spiked to 991 procedures daily and a nursing-home operator who took in $1.5 million in salary and profit the same year he was fined for neglecting the home’s residents.The 2006 overhaul spurred by that investigation was financed by a $1.5 billion payment from the federal government with tough terms: the state had to recoup the money by September 2011 or pay back the shortfall. To take charge, Gov. in 2007 appointed Mr. Sheehan, who had prosecuted health care fraud for 20 years as an assistant attorney in .Mr. Sheehan exceeded recovery targets. Over all, the state reclaimed 1.2 percent of its total Medicaid spending, the nation’s highest rate.But complaints from providers mounted, and were taken up by legislators. The providers charged that under pressure to meet the federal target, Mr. Sheehan treated paperwork errors like fraud. At one legislative hearing, he was accused of “gangster tactics” for demanding that providers settle with the state or risk having to pay more based on findings extrapolated from statistical samples.“Jim Sheehan was able to make up his own rules,” said Richard J. Herrick, president of the New York State Health Facilities Association, a nursing-home trade group. “It wasn’t for purity, it was where can we find money to recoup.”In June, Mr. Sheehan was dismissed with a month’s notice in a phone call from Mr. Cuomo’s director of operations.“He said, ‘We’ve decided to go in a different direction,’ ” recalled Mr. Sheehan, who has since been hired as the chief integrity officer and executive deputy commissioner for the , which oversees Medicaid in .A spokesman for the Cuomo administration would not specify the reasons for the decision, and Mr. Sheehan said that as a political appointee, he had no problem with it. But he disputed providers’ accusations, saying that the real issue was his challenge to a powerful industry that is a large employment engine.“Medicaid is to New York what corn is to ,” he said. “It’s a heavy lift.”He said that audits of nursing homes, for example, found that some had inflated their profits by needlessly sending every patient to during the month when annual reimbursement rates were calculated.The nursing-home trade group sought an injunction to stop the audits. A court dismissed the association’s argument that Mr. Sheehan had exceeded his jurisdiction.Mr. Herrick said that the decision was on appeal, and that his association was revising audit protocols with Mr. Cox, the new inspector general. “I have no personal knowledge that facilities followed the practice alleged,” he said, “and as a practical matter find it highly unlikely.”In home health care agencies, Mr. Sheehan said auditors found widespread patterns that violated Medicaid requirements linked to quality of care.“Nurses are supposed to review the work and design the plan of the home health aides, but there were cookie-cutter plans,” he said, citing one plan that failed to mention that the patient was an amputee or to explain how the aide was to care for the stump.“Home health aides would not show up, or would be in two places at once,” he added. “One entity billed us 500 times for home health care while patients were in the hospital.”Mr. Sheehan would not name audited agencies, but two of his former managers said the largest audit was of Visiting Nurse Service of New York, a $1 billion nonprofit group. That audit gained attention a year ago, when an internal report citing tens of millions of dollars in overpayments was leaked to The Wall Street Journal. At the time, the agency’s chief executive was on a task force advising the new governor on how to redesign Medicaid to trim costs.Richard Rothstein, a spokesman for Visiting Nurse Service, said that under an agreement with the inspector general’s office, he could not talk about the audit, which started in 2008 and has not been released. But he added, “There is absolutely no discussion about fraud,” only “errors in paperwork.”One example cited in the preliminary report was a bill for an eight-hour-long sponge bath. Mr. Rothstein said that there had been no intent to cheat Medicaid and that the aide who started the sponge bath had forgotten to report that a nursing crisis had intervened before she finished it hours later.Many providers welcomed Mr. Sheehan’s exit, but Richard J. Mollot, executive director of the Long Term Care Community Coalition, which advocates for nursing-home residents, did not.“It was politics at its worst to see him leave,” Mr. Mollot said. “They put enormous pressure on that office to sustain their budget, so to then turn around and say they were too aggressive is the height of hypocrisy.”After Mr. Sheehan’s dismissal, lawmakers unanimously passed a bill curbing the office’s authority. It cut the government’s time to reclaim overpayments to three years from six and let providers submit corrected bills rather than repay.Mr. Cuomo, an aggressive prosecutor of Medicaid fraud as attorney general, vetoed the bill. “The provider community, as a whole, plays a critical role,” his veto message said, “and many of their concerns reflected in this bill are legitimate.” But, he added, the bill “would potentially allow fraudulent and abusive activity to go undetected or unprosecuted.”Instead, he ordered Mr. Cox to review policies with “a working group comprised of representatives of provider associations and others.”Mr. Cox’s confirmation last week, after a nine-month wait, underscored the change in climate. At genial committee hearings, state senators said they were receiving positive feedback from providers, but one warned that the vetoed bill would be resubmitted “if we hear otherwise.”Mr. Introne, the deputy health secretary, said that Medicaid providers followed rules better now than they did five years ago. Mr. Sheehan agreed, and said his successor was well-qualified. But he noted that dozens of city audits he had asked to start or to release in his new job were still awaiting Mr. Cox’s approval.Audit figures released by the state show that Mr. Cox’s findings of overpayments have fallen steeply since Sept. 30, when the state met the deadline for the $1.5 billion federal target.Mr. Cox, a 23-year veteran of audits for the Health and Human Services inspector general, said he involved government lawyers and providers at the outset of an audit and examined every audit himself to make sure its findings could withstand a court challenge. That has held up some audits, he acknowledged, including that of Visiting Nurse Service, which is “still being reviewed and discussed with the entity and its lawyers to see what areas we agree on or disagree on.”“We’re all about fighting fraud,” he said, and “also about improving program integrity, quality of care, and saving taxpayer dollars. That’s our mission, and we’re sticking with it.”'"
"'12-03-19,'1','“Usually, by late December it’s too cold for ticks to be out questing for a blood meal,” said Richard Pollack, a public health entomologist and instructor in the department of immunology and infectious diseases at the Harvard School of Public Health.“Last year at this time, people were sitting in their living rooms watching TV, but now they’re out in their neighborhoods, enjoying the warm weather with their dogs and wearing T-shirts,” Dr. Pollack said.“It’s not that the warm weather has created more ticks,” he added, “but it has created the opportunity for both humans and ticks to be more active, and to make contact with each other.”While some experts say the prevalence of dog-biting ticks this mild winter indicates neither a more virulent tick nor an increased risk of Lyme disease in dogs and humans, a recent study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that data from dogs may help predict areas of Lyme disease emergence. In addition, the study found that combining data from both humans and dogs could assist health officials in targeting Lyme disease prevention efforts.Though most entomologists decline making any predictions about the coming tick season, Dr. Scott Demanes, a veterinarian from Peoria, Ill., said that ticks this winter had kept him busy treating dogs with tick bites well beyond late fall.“The whole winter, there’s never really been a lull,” Dr. Demanes said.“If a dog is not scratching the area a lot, many owners have no idea the dog has a tick bite unless it starts to engorge with blood,” he said.At the Bristol County Veterinary Hospital in Seekonk, Mass., Dr. Amy Hurd recommends that all dogs be tested annually for Lyme disease. She also worries that the bleak economy has led some pet owners to forgo buying the protective lotions that ward off ticks.“Times are hard for a lot of people these days, and for some pet owners, tick lotion can seem like a luxury — they just don’t have the money,” Dr. Hurd said.“There are a lot of choices to make, but with the warm winter weather we’ve just had, dog owners should be applying a tick lotion and checking their dogs every day,” Dr. Hurd said.Of course, even the most vigilant pet owners can discover that despite their best efforts, they have not eluded the ever intrepid and terribly tiny tick. Aggie Hozempa of Warren, R.I., and her yellow Labrador retriever, Libby Lane — one of Dr. Hurd’s patients — both received a diagnosis of Lyme disease contracted from tick bites in November.“I had severe pain in my right knee, and when an M.R.I. ruled out an injury, the doctor ran a blood test, and I tested positive for Lyme disease,” Ms. Hozempa said. “Dr. Hurd tested Libby Lou, and it was the same story, but my dog had zero symptoms.”Both Ms. Hozempa and Libby Lane were treated with doxycycline and are now healthy and symptom-free, resuming their daily walks, covered with a protective tick lotion and never straying from a paved bike path.“As a golfer, if on occasion my ball ends up in the woods, I will not go and get it,” Ms. Hozempa said. “Tick bites and Lyme disease are just so bizarre and frightening. I’m trying to be proactive, but these ticks are like the size of a pepper flake. The wind can blow one on you or your dog, and you’d never know it.”'"

It will announce its plans in a conference call at 9 a.m. Eastern time.Apple, which recently released the newest version of its , said it would not provide any information about how its business was going in the current quarter, restricting the discussion with reporters to questions about its cash.Apple, based in Cupertino, Calif., is widely expected to announce a plan to issue a continuing dividend to its shareholders. As its cash has piled up, Wall Street analysts and investors have begun to call more loudly for Apple to return some of it to shareholders as dividends. Although having too much cash is rarely seen as a burden for a company, Apple earns less than 1 percent in interest on the cash, which many investors view as wasteful.Until recently, Apple had resisted pressure to issue a dividend, a practice often associated with mature companies that have settled into slower rates of sales and earnings growth.While it is more than three and a half decades old, Apple has been on a growth spurt that is highly unusual for a company of its age. The success of new products like the and iPad has propelled both revenue and profits; during the holiday quarter, for example, the company more than doubled its profit from the same period in the prior year.'"

"'12-03-19,'1','Chevron, the foreign oil company with the largest operations in Brazil, has argued that the country’s response to the November spill, which was a tiny fraction of the size of the 2010 BP spill, was an “overreaction.”“I’ve never seen a spill this small with this size of reaction,” Ali Moshiri, who is in charge of Chevron’s Latin America operations, told The in late 2011.Such comments did not seem to sit well in Brazil. Authorities accused Chevron of lying about the scope of the November spill. And the news media criticized George Buck, the head of Chevron’s Brazil operations, after he and Mr. Moshiri were summoned to Brazil’s Congress to discuss the spill, questioning why Mr. Buck relied on a translator instead of speaking Portuguese.Now Mr. Buck, an American, is barred from leaving Brazil, and a lengthy legal battle awaits him and other employees at Chevron and Transocean.Judge Magalhães issued his ruling prohibiting the departure of the 17 Chevron and Transocean employees at the request of a federal prosecutor. “There is no doubt the exit of these people from the country, at this moment, would generate considerable risk to the investigation,” the judge said.Prosecutors said the criminal charges in connection with environmental crimes could result in prison terms of 20 years for each defendant.Kurt Glaubitz, a Chevron spokesman, said in a statement that “any legal decision will be abided by the company and its employees.”“We will defend the company and its employees,” he said. Mr. Moshiri, the top Chevron executive for the region, was not available for comment.Guy Cantwell, a spokesman for Transocean, the operator of the rig at the offshore field controlled by Chevron, declined to comment.As Chevron and Transocean prepared to respond to the possible criminal charges over the spill, prosecutors said the companies may also face charges related to the seepage found Friday in the field, called Frade. It resulted in a sheen extending over one kilometer, or five-eighths of a mile.Chevron said it had halted output at Frade, which has the capacity to produce 80,000 barrels a day, while the company captures the oil in containment devices. According to estimates provided by Chevron, the seepage released much smaller amounts of oil than the 3,000 barrels that leaked from sea-floor cracks at the field last November.Nevertheless, the latest seepage points to the technical difficulties of producing oil in Brazilian waters. Big oil reserves lie under about four miles of sea, rock and salt deposits. In 2011 alone, , the state-controlled oil company that dominates Brazil’s energy industry, had 66 leaks of oil in its operations, releasing 234,000 liters of oil, according to a report by the newspaper Folha de São Paulo.“We cannot allow one leak, no matter how small,” said Maria das Graças Foster, Petrobras’s chief executive, in an interview here this month. Ms. Foster said she had created a working group in her office that will report to her directly about leaks or spills of any volume. “We are working to have zero leaks, none at all.”The scrutiny over offshore oil leakages and Chevron’s handling of its November spill is also unfolding alongside other politicized debates.Brazil remains more open to foreign oil companies than some oil-producing countries like or , and Chevron and other international oil companies have gained a foothold here. But Brazil has also asserted greater state control over its oil industry by ensuring that Petrobras oversees and gets a dominant role in new exploration areas.Elected officials throughout Brazil are also engaged in a contentious discussion over the distribution of oil royalties. As Brazil increases its production, the state of Rio de Janeiro, where the bulk of the nation’s energy industry is based, is trying to maintain a big share of the royalties.Rio stands to lose billions in revenue if the royalties are more equally distributed among Brazil’s 26 states.“This accident is proof that producing states should receive a bigger share of the royalties,” Sergio Cabral, Rio’s governor, recently said of the Chevron spill, arguing that part of the royalties would be used for spill prevention and cleanup efforts.'"

"'12-03-20,'0','The suspicions of Ms. Moulin and her family were aroused last year when more than 30 artworks that had been reported missing or stolen were found in a vault at the Wildenstein Institute, a nonprofit research organization the Wildensteins run from a mansion on the Right Bank. The items, most of which had vanished years earlier during the settlement of estates, were recovered in an unrelated investigation.But members of one Jewish family told the police that they believed a sculpture of theirs recovered from the vault could have been looted by the Nazis because it appeared on no postwar estate lists.Guy Wildenstein, the billionaire who leads the family business from New York, declined through his lawyers to comment on Ms. Moulin’s accusations. But he has contended that the institute never hid missing works, saying it simply lacked a full inventory of what was in its vault.Lawyers for Mr. Wildenstein, who is Jewish, have strenuously denied that any of the seized items were Nazi loot.The Monet vanished in a Gestapo raid on a bank vault in the southwest of France, from which 10 paintings belonging to Ms. Moulin’s father, Max Heilbronn, were taken. Heilbronn was a member of the Resistance whose French Jewish family was forced out of the historic Galeries Lafayette store on Boulevard Haussmann in Paris and replaced by Nazi collaborators. He was imprisoned in Buchenwald with other French resisters, including Étienne Moulin, who later married Mr. Heilbronn’s daughter, Ginette, and took charge of Galeries Lafayette.Four of the family’s works have been recovered, including a painting of pastel roses that the family spotted when it came up for sale at in 2004. Two Pissarro landscapes were also recovered from the home of Hermann Goering, ’s second in command.Even now, though, more than half the artworks taken from Jewish families in France and during World War II remain missing.Alexandre Bronstein, whose family’s sculpture was found in the Wildenstein vault, said new clues could come when archives from a 1949 war-crimes trial of a German diplomat who organized the looting are unsealed in 2024.What drives Ms. Moulin to keep searching after so many years?“This painting represents some of the history of our family,” she said. “It was my grandson who pushed me to react. He doesn’t understand how this could happen.”Ms. Moulin said that in the 1950s, her mother, Paulette Heilbronn, met with an art dealer who had a photograph of the painting, and that he pledged to recover it. But when Mrs. Heilbronn approached the dealer again, he told her it was in the possession of people who were “untouchable,” Ms. Moulin saidYears later the family discovered references to the missing painting in the 1979 and the 1996 editions of Daniel Wildenstein’s five-volume inventory, or catalogue raisonné, of Monet’s work. Such catalogs list all known authenticated works by an artist and serve as something of an imprimatur. No major auction house, for example, will sell a work as a Monet unless it is listed in the Wildenstein inventory.The catalogs’ mention of the missing Monet fueled suspicions in Ms. Moulin’s family that the Wildensteins either had the painting or knew where it was, she said. But the Wildensteins repeatedly stymied her family’s inquiries, she added.In 2002 records show that her lawyers asked Guy Wildenstein for help in locating the painting and that he referred them to the Wildenstein Institute, which said it had no information about the painting’s whereabouts.In recent months Guy Wildenstein has been interviewed at least seven times by investigators in connection with the institute case, according to confidential French judicial records. That case is an outgrowth of the family’s long-running internal clash over the multimillion-dollar estate of Daniel Wildenstein, Guy Wildenstein’s father.The elder Wildenstein’s widow, Sylvia Roth, pursued lawsuits against her stepson until her death in 2010 and accused the family of hiding its wealth and artworks through trusts in offshore accounts. The raid on the Wildenstein Institute was part of the fact-finding in that case.“When we heard about these strange stories, I thought it was the right moment to struggle to get back the painting,” said Guillaume Houzé, 30, a grandson of Ms. Moulin’s.The quest to find the missing Monet has reached the in New York. It owns a Monet that is described as a near twin of the missing painting. Its work, “Torrent of the Petite Creuse at Fresselines,” was purchased by the Wildensteins in 1958 from a private collector, then sold to another collector, Milton de Groot. She bequeathed it in 1967 to the Met, which lists it as “Rapids on the Petite Creuse at Fresselines.”It is not on display, though the museum has posted a copy online with a notation that says it “is nearly identical to another painting (private collection.)” The Met says its information about the other painting came from the Wildenstein catalog.Last summer the Conference on Jewish Material Claims Against Germany, a New York-based organization that tries to arrange for the restitution of property to Holocaust survivors and their heirs, asked the museum about its painting’s provenance.The museum said the paintings were clearly different. It also produced a typed, unsigned English translation of a 1961 letter from Max Heilbronn to Daniel Wildenstein, in which Mr. Heilbronn acknowledges that the Met’s work “cannot be the one which was stolen from me during the war.” The museum has not been able to find a copy of the original letter.“There’s no question that this is not the canvas,” said Harold Holzer, a spokesman for the Met. “The Met has made its collections available to scholars and to students and, when necessary, to people doing research on paintings for legal questions. There is nothing hidden here.” He said there had never been a formal challenge to the painting.The person who could perhaps provide the most information, Daniel Wildenstein, is buried below two obelisks in Montparnasse Cemetery here. A few months before Mr. Wildenstein died, Ms. Moulin’s New York lawyer asked him why he reported in his 1996 catalog that her painting was held by a private collector.A few weeks later a brief letter was sent out by the Wildenstein Institute, dated Sept. 12, 2001, carrying Daniel Wildenstein’s typed name and signature.“I regret,” the letter said, “that this error slipped into the new edition of the book.”It contained no other information about the painting.'"

"'12-03-20,'0','The soldier accused of killing 16 Afghan civilians this month ran afoul of financial regulations more than a decade ago when he worked as a stockbroker. He was fined for defrauding a couple from Columbus, Ohio, and when the fine was not paid he was suspended from the brokerage industry, officials said on Monday.Lawyers for the soldier, Staff Sgt. Robert Bales, 38, have said he was inspired to join the military after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, and friends and neighbors have said in interviews that he left behind a promising business career to serve his country. But records from the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, or Finra, show that he and several colleagues were accused of fraud the previous year, in May 2000, in a case that led to more than $1.2 million in fines in 2003.The case stems from Mr. Bales’s days as a broker at a securities firm in Ohio, where he sold stocks and bonds to retail investors. He and several colleagues were accused of selling unsuitable and overly risky investments. The case, regulatory records show, involved the stocks of Stearns & Lehman, a specialty food products company, as well as Orange County bonds and various mortgage investments, including products issued by Freddie Mac.The brokers denied wrongdoing, sending the matter before a Finra arbitration panel, which in 2003 ruled against Mr. Bales and his co-defendants. The panel, saying Mr. Bales had “engaged in fraud, breach of fiduciary duty” and “unauthorized trading,” fined most of the brokers more than $1.2 million in punitive and compensatory damages.By the time the panel handed down the ruling, Mr. Bales had begun a new life in the Army. He did not appear before the arbitration panel, and failed to pay the fine. Ultimately, regulators suspended him from the industry.'"
"'12-03-20,'0','Falling global fertility rates are hardly a cause for handwringing pessimism.We should celebrate the advances that come from access to affordable voluntary contraception and the empowerment of women. The benefits to individuals and families are obvious. But communities and countries gain, too.As societies shift to smaller families, there are more resources available for health and education. Improvements in those areas can lead to greater productivity. And that, in turn, can provide the financial resources needed to provide for an aging population.All things considered, it’s a far less daunting challenge than is posed by endless population growth in a world with limited resources.David Brooks’s column about a global fertility implosion carries important implications for immigration policy. In particular, his analysis suggests that keeping relatively open borders will be critical to maintaining our position in the global economy.However overpopulated the world may be as a whole, there is no question that it will be more difficult for countries with low population replacement rates to pay for the retirement of their elders. And societies struggling under that burden will be less competitive globally.David Brooks writes that lower birthrates will result in a lower American living standard.'"

It also produced a typed, unsigned English translation of a 1961 letter from Max Heilbronn to Daniel Wildenstein, in which Mr. Heilbronn acknowledges that the Met’s work “cannot be the one which was stolen from me during the war.” The museum has not been able to find a copy of the original letter.“There’s no question that this is not the canvas,” said Harold Holzer, a spokesman for the Met. “The Met has made its collections available to scholars and to students and, when necessary, to people doing research on paintings for legal questions. There is nothing hidden here.” He said there had never been a formal challenge to the painting.The person who could perhaps provide the most information, Daniel Wildenstein, is buried below two obelisks in Montparnasse Cemetery here. A few months before Mr. Wildenstein died, Ms. Moulin’s New York lawyer asked him why he reported in his 1996 catalog that her painting was held by a private collector.A few weeks later a brief letter was sent out by the Wildenstein Institute, dated Sept. 12, 2001, carrying Daniel Wildenstein’s typed name and signature.“I regret,” the letter said, “that this error slipped into the new edition of the book.”It contained no other information about the painting.'"
"'12-03-20,'0','BEIJING — Liu Ping, a rights activist who has angered officials in China with her advocacy of free elections and support of labor and women’s rights issues, has been missing since early this month after she was detained in Beijing by security personnel from her hometown, according to an advocacy group.Wang Songlian, a researcher at Chinese Human Rights Defenders, said Monday that Ms. Liu’s disappearance was most likely part of a wave of detentions tied to the meetings of China’s handpicked legislature, the National People’s Congress, and an advisory body, the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference. The meetings typically lead to detentions of people whom the authorities consider troublesome, in an attempt to stop those people from petitioning the government, the group said. The meetings ended last week.Although the crackdown is an annual event, “in general the feeling is that this year is more serious than previous years,” with China facing its biggest leadership transition in a decade later this year, Ms. Wang said.Ms. Liu, 47, who is from the city of Xinyu in the southern province of Jiangxi, sent two text messages to Chinese Human Rights Defenders on March 6, saying that she had been intercepted at a Beijing train station by a group of people working for her former employer, the state-owned Xinyu Iron and Steel Company, Ms. Wang said. Ms. Liu’s cellphone has been off since then, Ms. Wang said.“I didn’t come to Beijing to petition, I came to find work!” one of the messages read, according to Chinese Human Rights Defenders. “They are ruthless, they are shutting me down economically! I have to put my daughter through university!”Ms. Liu has petitioned the government in the past and she has been detained before, she said in interviews last month.She campaigned last year as an independent candidate for a seat on Xinyu’s local congress but did not win. Her high-profile campaign helped inspire other independent candidacies around China, nearly all of which failed.'"
"'12-03-20,'0','A man who drinks one 12-ounce sugar-sweetened drink a day sharply increases his risk for heart disease, according to a large epidemiological analysis.Researchers analyzed data from a prospective study of 42,883 male health professionals, ages 40 to 75. The men responded to diet questionnaires every four years, and more than 18,000 of them provided blood samples.Over 22 years, 3,683 of the men had heart attacks. Even after controlling for factors like smoking, exercise and family history, the scientists found that men who drank the sweetened beverages most often were 20 percent more likely to have had a heart attack than those who drank the least.They calculated that one serving daily of a sugar-sweetened beverage was linked to a 19 percent increase in the relative risk of cardiovascular disease. The study was published online in the journal Circulation last week.Sugar-sweetened drinks were linked with adverse changes in levels of HDL, triglycerides and C-reactive protein. Dr. Frank B. Hu, senior author of the analysis and a professor of medicine at Harvard, said that a study a little over two years ago found similar results in women.Is diet soda a good alternative? No, said Dr. Hu.“Some studies have found a relationship between diet soda and metabolic disease,” he said.'"

"'12-03-20,'0','Apple executives said the move was also intended to attract a new class of investors. Many funds have rules that prevent them from owning a stock unless it pays a dividend.The decision to share some of its cash with stockholders also resonated symbolically. It is one of the clearest signs of change at Apple under the leadership of , who became chief executive after stepped down in August. Mr. Jobs, who died from complications of in October, long resisted calls to issue dividends and buy back shares, saying he preferred to hold onto the money for possible acquisitions or other investments.Apple said that it would pay a quarterly dividend of $2.65 a share beginning in its fiscal fourth quarter, which starts July 1, and that its board had authorized a $10 billion share buyback starting Sept. 30. In all, Apple expects to spend about $45 billion over three years on the plan, all of the money from cash generated by its sales.In a conference call with Wall Street analysts to announce the plan, Mr. Cook spent much of the time reassuring his audience that Apple’s top priority for its cash remained keeping the ability to finance its innovations. He said Apple still had a pipeline of strong products.“Simply stated we don’t see a ceiling to our opportunities,” said Mr. Cook. He added later that returning some of its cash to shareholders “will not close any doors for us.”Analysts generally agreed, saying that while the plan would slow the growth of Apple’s cash hoard, it would not reverse it. Even with the dividends and stock buybacks, analysts estimate that Apple’s total cash balance would grow by more than $30 billion a year in the near term because of how much new cash it takes in from its business.By the close of Apple’s next fiscal year, which will end in September 2013, Apple could have around $180 billion in cash, after dividends and buybacks, estimated Gene Munster, an analyst at Piper Jaffray. He also estimated that Apple would report net income of $41.2 billion for the current fiscal year.Apple executives said the plan would make it among the top dividend payers in the nation, but the amount is still small relative to its share price, amounting to a 1.8 percent annual yield on Apple’s stock.That places Apple at the low end of its peers in the technology world, said Mike Abramsky, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets,. In comparison, he said, Microsoft pays a 2.5 percent dividend, Intel pays a 3 percent dividend and pays a 2 percent dividend.In a research note, A. M. Sacconaghi Jr., an analyst with Bernstein Research, expressed disappointment with the size of Apple’s dividend, calling it a “pretty vanilla return of cash program.” Other investors said they thought Apple had done a good job of balancing competing concerns with the size of the dividend.“It’s not too piddling, and on the other hand not so large to signal that growth prospects aren’t what they thought,” said David A. Rolfe, chief investment officer of Wedgewood Partners, a money management firm whose largest holding is Apple.Shares of Apple rose 2.65 percent, or $15.53, to $601.10 Monday.Apple’s shares were already widely held, but the decision to pay a dividend might spread them around even more. Every large fund family, from Fidelity to Vanguard, has “income-oriented funds” that will now be able to buy Apple shares, said Bill Choi, a managing director for Janney Scott. “It is one high-quality name that they can own,” Mr. Choi said.Mr. Jobs’s resistance to paying dividends was hardly unique in Silicon Valley. Even other dividend-paying technology companies like , and Microsoft are still among the biggest cash hoarders. , which does not yet pay a dividend, is in the club, too.“There is a in Silicon Valley where senior management likes to have a lot of cash on hand,” said David B. Yoffie, a professor at Harvard Business School. “Every financial economist would tell you it’s silly.”Professor Yoffie said the mentality stems partly from the “near-death experiences” that some pioneers in technology have undergone, Apple included. When Mr. Jobs returned to Apple in 1997, it was near bankruptcy. Apple stopped paying dividends to its shareholders in December 1995, when its cash reserves were dwindling.Earlier this year, Mr. Cook announced that Apple’s board was actively discussing what to do with the company’s cash. While the bulk of $45 billion it expects to spend will go to its dividend, Apple said its share repurchase would account for $10 billion of that figure over three years. Its primary purpose will be to eliminate the shareholder dilution that will occur from future Apple employee equity grants and stock purchase programs.Apple said it would not finance the dividends and buybacks using any of the cash generated by overseas sales, which currently account for about two-thirds of its total cash balance. To bring that cash back to the United States, Apple would have to pay hefty repatriation , very likely more than 30 percent.The amount of money held overseas is likely to become a bigger part of its cash balance in the future as more of its sales shift to developing markets like . Apple told Congress that current tax laws discourage United States companies from bringing foreign-held cash back home.'"

"'12-03-21,'0','The studies, led by Dr. Peter M. Rothwell, a professor of clinical neurology at the University of Oxford, were published in the medical journal The Lancet. A third paper by Dr. Rothwell and his colleagues, published in The Lancet Oncology, compared the findings of observational studies and randomized trials of aspirin.There is an urgent need for clinical trials of treatment regimens incorporating aspirin, Dr. Rothwell said.“What really jumps out at you in terms of prevention is the striking 75 percent reduction in esophageal cancer and a 40 to 50 percent reduction in colorectal cancer, which is the most common cancer right now,” Dr. Rothwell said. “In terms of prevention, anyone with a family history would be sensible to take aspirin,” he added.But while some experts called the new findings “provocative” and “encouraging,” mounting evidence about the preventive promise of aspirin puts health providers in a quandary. Aspirin increases the risk of not just of gastrointestinal bleeding, but of hemorrhagic strokes.The new studies, however, also found that the risk of bleeding in aspirin users diminished over time, and that the risk of death from brain bleeds was actually lower in the aspirin users than in the comparison group.“I think he’s on to something. I just want to be cautious, and I don’t want to exaggerate,” said Dr. Otis W. Brawley, chief medical officer and executive vice president of the American Cancer Society. “I’m not ready to say that everybody ought to take a baby aspirin a day to prevent cancer.”Dr. Andrew T. Chan, an associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and co-author of a comment published with the articles in The Lancet, said the studies, despite their limitations, “raise the level of excitement about using aspirin as a chemopreventive agent.”“If you start to include the possibility that aspirin reduces the cancer risk beyond colon cancer, then the risk-benefit ratio shifts quite a bit, especially for those cancers where we have little to offer in the way of screening and early diagnosis,” Dr. Chan said.The randomized clinical trials the Oxford investigators examined were not focused on cancer prevention; they were originally intended to study the effects of aspirin on preventing heart disease. The application of the findings to cancer prevention may be flawed, some experts said.In the United States, two major studies of low-dose aspirin to prevent cancer did not find reductions in cancer with aspirin use. Those findings were excluded from analysis by the Oxford researchers because they involved use of aspirin every other day, rather than daily use.Though many Americans use baby aspirin daily to reduce their risk of heart disease, patients are generally advised to do so only when their cardiac risk is presumed to outweigh the risks of taking aspirin. Physicians remain extremely reluctant to recommend long-term use of aspirin in a healthy population.Some cancer doctors commended the new research, saying that despite the limitations of the analyses, no other long-term clinical trials of aspirin and cancer are likely to be done because of the enormous expense involved and the fact that aspirin is a cheap generic drug.'"
"'12-03-21,'0','The two cases the justices considered concerned defendants who were 14 when they were involved in killings. According to the Equal Justice Initiative, there are about 80 prisoners serving sentences of life without parole for murders committed when they were 14 or younger.One case, Miller v. Alabama, No. 10-9646, involved Evan Miller, an Alabama man who was 14 in 2003 when he and an older youth beat a 52-year-old neighbor and set fire to his home after the three had spent the evening smoking marijuana and playing drinking games. The neighbor died of smoke inhalation.The other, Jackson v. Hobbs, No. 10-9647, concerned Kuntrell Jackson, an Arkansas man who was 14 when he and two older youths tried to rob a video store in 1999. One of the other youths shot and killed a store clerk.Kent G. Holt, an assistant state attorney general in Arkansas, said the victim, Laurie Troup, was 28. Her body was found by her mother and her 11-year-old son.“The punishment for this crime reinforces the sanctity of human life,” Mr. Holt said, “and it expresses the state’s moral outrage that something like this could happen.”Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg responded that there were important values on Mr. Jackson’s side, too.“You say the sanctity of human life,” she told Mr. Holt, “but you’re dealing with a 14-year-old being sentenced to life in prison, so he will die in prison without any hope. I mean, essentially, you’re making a 14-year-old throwaway person.”Mr. Stevenson later picked up on the point. He said his request was in one sense modest.“We are not suggesting that states should not be able to impose very harsh punishments and very severe sentences on even children who commit these kinds of violent crimes,” he said.“They can even impose sentences that give them the authority to maintain control of the lives of these children for the rest of their natural lives,” he said. “What we are arguing is that they cannot do so with no hope of release, that that would be incompatible with child status.”John C. Neiman Jr., Alabama’s solicitor general, said the sorts of parole hearings that Mr. Stevenson sought imposed burdens.“There’s really no cost to society at least in allowing that process to occur,” Mr. Neiman said, “but the cost is to the victims and their families, who have to endure what are often very painful hearings.”Much of the argument concerned the lines the court might draw. It could prohibit sentences of life without parole for offenders younger than 15. Or it could bar the punishment for all juvenile offenders, which would affect more than 2,000 prisoners.The court could also bar sentences of life without parole for defendants like Mr. Jackson, who was an accomplice and not the gunman, while leaving them available for defendants like Mr. Miller, who actually committed the killing. Or it could bar mandatory sentences, which are common, and require judges and juries to take account of the defendant’s youth.Mr. Stevenson said the court should extend its ruling in the Graham case to bar all sentences of life without parole for crimes committed by juveniles.If the court is not prepared to do that, he said, it should bar such sentences for offenders younger than 15 and bar mandatory sentences of life without parole for all juvenile offenders.'"
"'12-03-21,'0','“It woke us up a little bit,” Ms. Caswell, 25, of Hackensack, N.J., said of their business meeting amid beds of daffodils and stands of forsythia. “We were feeling tired, and now we’re more chipper and also more relaxed.”On the waterfront promenade behind the World Financial Center, two American Express employees, Jenna Hess, 28, a senior marketing manager, and Balaji Viswanath, 36, the director of online marketing, had abandoned their offices on the spur of the moment and were reviewing their progress on a Web site for small-businesses alfresco. “It energizes you, so when you go back inside, you’re raring to go,” Ms. Hess said.Mr. Viswanath admitted that outside was not always the best place to get more serious work done. “These meetings are more for catching up to make sure we’re all on the same page,” he said. “Looking at heavy material would probably be a little more distracting.”Not far away from Ms. Hess and Mr. Viswanath, a man in a striped shirt went over marketing strategies with a group of women, all of them sitting on a group of large stone blocks. “We thought it would be great scenery to help us tap into our creative juices,” the man said, declining to give his name because of office policy.Whether the bosses would agree that working outside boosts productivity is an open question. Sean O’Keefe, 28, was not worried about that. He is in the middle of a job search and had planned to hunker down at the New York Public Library on Fifth Avenue. But Bryant Park, whose green lawn spreads out behind the library, beckoned.Having quit his job at a hedge fund last week, Mr. O’Keefe settled into a bistro table with his MacBook just before noon. The sun filtered through the London plane trees, whose branches were still bare, as he began to compose a cover letter. “It’s so nice that I decided to come out here instead,” he said. “It’s very Parisian. The only downside is the glare.”On the High Line, a steady stream of tourists filed past three software developers who met over falafel to discuss a new educational gardening game they were developing. Dan White and Maurice Cheeks of Filament Games had flown in from Wisconsin for a series of meetings and visited the walkway at the recommendation of their associate. “He recommended this wonderful falafel place, Taim, which was right by this beautiful park, so we thought, Why not?” Mr. White, 31, said.There were times when the silken air, distant laughter and scent of spring flowers were at odds with the work itself.That incongruity was perhaps most stark on a boulder in Central Park, near East 66th Street, where Mitchell Quatinetz, a part-time student at Hunter College, and his tutor, Josh Manley, were taking part in a more common corollary to conducting business outside — holding class outside — and poring over a physics review book.“If we want to know the total capacitance of a circuit, we need to first figure out what type of circuit it is — whether series or parallel,” explained Mr. Manley, who held a dry-erase board on his lap. A few feet away, toddlers scampered over the rocks, while the strains of a nearby accordion provided an unusual soundtrack.As for the work at hand, it would not be inaccurate to say that at various outdoor sessions clients were discussed, problems explored, decisions made. But it is also true that at least one of the meetings morphed seamlessly into the afternoon break, without anyone having to go anywhere.“We actually finished our work,” said Ms. Cosio, one of the Cooke Center clinicians, dallying under a crab apple tree in Central Park. “But we’re still hanging out.”'"

"'12-03-21,'0','That vote seemed to catch Democratic leaders by surprise, given that the amendment had Republican co-sponsors. But before the vote, Senator Mitch McConnell, the minority leader, urged his Republican members to vote against the Export-Import measure even though many of them supported it.A yes vote would result in the measure being sent back to the House for approval, because the House did not include the Export-Import Bank in its legislation. Mr. McConnell said that would unnecessarily delay the bill’s trip to President Obama’s desk.Mr. Reid said that if the Senate did not complete work on the Export-Import Bank on Tuesday, that it would not be able to do so until possibly after the bank’s current authorization expired. Mr. Reid said the Senate had several other issues that it needed to turn to and he could not “move it ahead of everything else.”Mr. McConnell countered that if he were majority leader, “we could turn to that very quickly.”Mr. Reid blamed Republicans for the failure to move the bill through the Senate. “Reauthorizing the Export-Import Bank is something that has always been done on a broad, bipartisan basis,” Mr. Reid said. “Republicans must now explain to the American people why they decided that the marching orders they received from their extremist Tea Party allies are more important than the jobs of hard-working Americans across the country.”Senate Democrats met Tuesday evening to decide how to proceed in a situation that could bring considerable embarrassment. The JOBS bill passed by a 390-23 vote in the House, one of the largest margins in recent memory for a bill that included significant policy initiatives.President Obama has also said that he approved of the House legislation, while allowing that it could use some tweaks to further protect investors. And earlier on Tuesday, Mr. Reid himself signaled that the bill was likely to make it through the Senate.“This is an important piece of legislation, as flawed as it may be,” he said.'"
"'12-03-21,'0','SAN FRANCISCO — Hewlett-Packard said Wednesday it will merge its personal computer and printing divisions in an effort to cut costs, improve its designs and become more efficient.The consolidation is the first major strategic move by Meg Whitman since she became chief executive last September. Until now, she had focused on understanding H.P.’s businesses, which are as various as home computers, corporate call centers and computing systems, and on communicating her ideas to employees. Last month, however, she warned of radical changes, possibly including significant layoffs.Layoffs now seem likely. Personal computers and printing have overlaps in many areas, including manufacturing and marketing. Both businesses have been challenged by the popularity of cloud computing and Apple’s iPad, which allow easy storage and display of documents and photos. Besides cost savings, H.P. wants PCs and printers designed and sold so they work better together.The new combined division will be run by R. Todd Bradley, who runs H.P.’s PC business, called the personal systems group. Vyomesh I. Joshi, who runs H.P.’s imaging and printing group, will retire after 31 years with H.P.Mr. Joshi, one of the best-liked leaders at H.P., was for many years responsible for much of the company’s total profits, largely because of the high margins on printer cartridges. Efforts to expand in areas like industrial printing, however, have been disappointing.The merger, initially reported Tuesday by All Things D, will create a division accounting for about half of H.P.’s revenues. In the quarter ended Jan. 31, PCs and printing had combined revenue of $15.1 billion, out of a revenue total of $30.4 billion, and earnings of $1.2 billion, out of total earnings of $2.9 billion. A year earlier, the two groups had combined revenue of $17.1 billion and earnings of $1.8 billion.'"
"'12-03-21,'0','WASHINGTON — Two of the White House’s nominees to fill vacancies on the Federal Reserve board moved closer to confirmation on Tuesday after a routine Senate hearing.The Senate banking committee held a hearing to test the two candidates, the Harvard economist Jeremy C. Stein and Jerome H. Powell, a former private equity executive and Treasury official. If the committee approves the two candidates as expected, perhaps as early as next week, and they pass a Senate vote, the Fed would have a full roster of seven confirmed governors for the first time in six years.The confirmation process for the two capital markets experts comes amid a tense political climate. For months, the White House has lashed out at Congress for failing to vote on confirming important economic policy makers, including nominees to the Fed board. Lawmakers, in turn, have criticized the White House for starting to vault over the traditional confirmation process.But Professor Stein and Mr. Powell seem to be candidates chosen to avoid a fight. The nomination of Mr. Powell, a Republican, is the first time in nearly 25 years that a president has nominated a member of the opposing party to the Fed’s powerful board, not counting the position of chairman. Mr. Powell is currently a visiting scholar at the Bipartisan Policy Center, a Washington-based research group.Professor Stein is an acclaimed academic economist. He served on President George H. W. Bush’s Council of Economic Advisers, and advised the Obama administration for six months in 2009.'"
"'12-03-21,'0','Li Junfeng, a Chinese government renewable energy policy maker who is also the president of the Chinese Renewable Energy Industries Association, a government-backed trade group, welcomed the Commerce Department’s decision not to levy heavier tariffs. “I’m happy that it’s not a lot, but not surprised — the Chinese government does not give too many subsidies to the companies,” he said.Whatever political spin proponents or critics might want to put on the tariff decision, there is no question that solar panels from China now control about half of the American market, while panels from the United States control less than a third.American imports of Chinese solar panels have soared to $2.65 billion last year from $21.3 million in 2005.While American manufacturers oppose the imports and filed the trade case against China, users of have benefited from low-cost Chinese solar panels. An American industry group composed of companies that sell and install solar panels said Tuesday that it was pleased with the relatively small size of the tariffs, having braced for higher ones.“This is a huge victory for the U.S. solar industry and our 100,000 employees,” said Jigar Shah, president of the Coalition for Affordable Solar Energy. “Given all our expectations, this is really good news.”Barry Cinnamon, chief executive of Westinghouse Solar, which imports panels from China and adds wiring, racking and other components, said he was relieved by the decision, which will raise the price of his 250-watt system to about $610 from $600.“If the tariffs were big, 20 percent or 50 percent or 100 percent, it would be really bad for U.S. jobs,” he said. “If it’s a small tariff, it does send a signal to encourage manufacturers to do more manufacturing in the U.S., but it’s not enough to have a huge impact on costs.” And it will not set off a trade war, he predicted.Globally, low-cost Chinese panels have driven down the cost of solar energy by two-thirds in the last four years, narrowing but not eliminating the wide price gap that used to separate solar power from electricity generated by burning fossil fuels.But the solar energy boom has had few benefits for American manufacturers. The plunging prices led to the bankruptcy of three American solar panel makers last August.One of the failures was , which cost the federal government more than $500 million. Solyndra’s collapse has been the subject of an investigation by Congressional Republicans, who contend that the Obama administration should not have lent so much money for an unproved clean energy program.The Commerce Department decision Tuesday may be the most comprehensive review yet by an American government agency of how China uses subsidies to dominate an industry.China now has about 700 solar panel manufacturers with a combined annual production capacity of 40 gigawatts of electricity — the electric power equivalent, at peak sunlight hours, to the total output of every electrical generating station in .Chinese companies have been able to grow so fast, and cut costs so quickly, because they could take large from government-owned .Although Chinese bankers and solar panel executives now deny that those loans were made at subsidized rates, that was a central issue in the Commerce Department’s antisubsidy review.The question facing the Commerce Department was whether the Chinese government’s support violated American laws — and international free trade rules — meant to prevent countries from spending government money to help exporters buy market share overseas.A few Chinese companies have acknowledged receiving substantial government assistance. Executives at Hunan Sunzone Optoelectronics, a solar panel manufacturer in Changsha, in south-central China, said in interviews in 2010 that they had been able to buy valuable land near downtown for a third of the citywide rate for industrial land. And the company said that Chinese bankers had offered large loans at just 6 percent interest — below market rates at the time — with the provincial government paying much of the interest.China’s huge and growing need for imported from volatile countries in the Mideast and has made energy independence one of the country’s highest strategic and economic objectives.Top Chinese officials have talked extensively in recent years about the need to support renewable energy industries. They also have encouraged local and provincial governments to remove regulatory obstacles and have pushed state-owned banks to lend heavily to the sector.And yet, until very recently, China has not focused on installing solar panels domestically. The factories were primarily geared for export.Government subsidies are by no means solely a Chinese practice. The United States supported the development of solar energy by offering financial incentives for companies and households to buy solar panels. And many states have put quotas on power companies for the amount of renewable energy they must buy.But China focused first on developing large-scale manufacturing of solar panels for export, and only in the last year has it started to subsidize the installation of large numbers of panels in China.The result is that up to 95 percent of China’s output in recent years has been exported, leading critics to suggest that China was capitalizing on other countries’ solar subsidies. Chinese officials have rejected those suggestions and have hinted that they might retaliate with a trade case against American exports of polysilicon, a material used in manufacturing solar panels.Ben Santarris, a spokesman for SolarWorld, a leader of the manufacturing coalition that filed the antisubsidy case at the Commerce Department, said that the company still hoped that higher tariffs would come this year. The Commerce Department will continue investigating evidence of Chinese subsidies, and later this year will reassess Tuesday’s preliminary ruling.The Commerce Department assigned a tariff of 2.9 percent to solar cells and panels from Suntech, 4.73 percent to solar cells and panels from and 3.61 percent for products from all other Chinese solar panel makers. The tariffs “are the first step in a multi-step process, but we believe they are a clear indication Suntech has been managing its business from a competitive perspective,” said Andrew Beebe, the chief commercial officer of Suntech.Mr. Li, the Chinese regulator, said that it would be wrong for the Commerce Department to assess any antidumping tariffs on Chinese solar panels in May because panel prices are even lower in China than in the United States.Some trade experts are already suggesting that the United States and China should look at trade strategies worked out between the United States and in the 1980s to manage Japan’s rapid rise as an exporter. These strategies included so-called voluntary export restraints by Japan, which were actually far from voluntary. They included restraints on Japanese cars in 1981 and government-led research efforts like Sematech, which helped establish to assist the American semiconductor industry.“The future of renewable alternative energy, and in this case solar energy, is too important to be left to be ‘solved’ by litigation,” said Alan Wolff, a trade official in the Nixon, and Carter administrations who was one of the leading trade lawyers during the struggles with Japan in the 1980s. “Beijing and Washington have the means to work out a mutually and globally beneficial way to work out a solution to the solar panel trade case.”The solar panel industry also faces a serious challenge from the plunging price of natural gas in the United States, where new drilling techniques have brought large increases in the amount of gas on the market. The deployment of those same drilling techniques in foreign markets could bring down the price of gas there as well. That could make solar panels seem costly.The Commerce Department decision is subject to a ruling by the that the domestic industry has suffered harm from imports. Such decisions usually favor the domestic industry when there have been bankruptcies or mass layoffs. Besides the three bankruptcies in the American solar industry, all last August, at least four of the biggest survivors have also resorted to sizable layoffs in the last two years.One of the companies, Evergreen Solar, announced in January of last year that it was moving production from to China because the Chinese government was offering more financial support for manufacturers there. But the move came too late to save the company from declaring bankruptcy.'"
"'12-03-21,'0','Louis C. K., who stars in the FX series and has performed in comedy specials on HBO, Showtime and Epix, said that he was seeking minimal outside interference and maximum ease for his audience.“I don’t have to go, ‘Here’s this product,’ to whatever company,” Louis C. K. said, “and then cringe and shrug and apologize to my fans for whatever words are being removed, whatever ads they’re having to watch, whatever marketing is being lobbed on.”The experiment worked: produced at a cost of $250,000, “Live at the Beacon Theater” sold more than 220,000 downloads and grossed over $1.1 million — enough for Louis C. K. to give $250,000 in bonuses to his crew and donate a further $280,000 to charities.Other comedians following Louis C. K.’s online trail say that they have been contemplating Internet-only projects for several months.Jim Gaffigan, an actor and stand-up comedian, said he began seeking new platforms for his material after a routine he performed about was partly edited out of a 2010 benefit special.Mr. Gaffigan said he considered many commercial routes, including licensing; selling a new stand-up performance to an online content provider like , Amazon or ; or making it available free to viewers who watched a block of commercials first.But Mr. Gaffigan said he was able to turn down unfavorable deals and corporate ties after Louis C. K. upended “the perception of selling something on your Web site as being kind of icky.”He added: “My manager was like, ‘You’re not going to sell it on your Web site like that.’ And I’m like, ‘Why wouldn’t I?’ ”Instead, Mr. Gaffigan will release his next special — with his McDonald’s routine intact — on April 11 for a $5 fee, with $1 from each sale going to charity.For the comedians taking their material directly to the Internet, the decision is as much a reflection of a desire to serve online-savvy audiences as it is a lack of other options.Pay-cable channels like HBO and Showtime, comedians say, are too focused on scripted programming, while on basic cable, Comedy Central offers specials to nearly everyone, with little quality control and licensing deals that are not lucrative.“I don’t get any money from the specials that air on Comedy Central,” said Mr. Ansari, who also stars on the comedy “Parks and Recreation.” “I haven’t seen any checks from the DVDs, CDs. If I just put it out in a traditional way, I wouldn’t have made any money, so why don’t I do it this way?” Comedy Central said Mr. Ansari had been paid a six-figure advance and continues to receive residuals on his last televised special.Kent Alterman, Comedy Central’s head of original programming and production, said that the number of stand-up specials it shows was “in service to our audience and our business,” and that only “a very rarefied community of comedians” commanded followings large enough to make Internet-only programs viable. Many performers — even those with a large fan base — would still go to Comedy Central for “the marketing muscle that we have and the enormous exposure they get,” he said.HBO says it still seeks top-tier performers for specials but is mindful of a glut of comedy on television, while Showtime’s entertainment president, David Nevins, said, “It’s fair to say Showtime needs to renew our focus on it.”The Internet has been happy to capitalize on content that television has neglected. Last month offered a free live performance by the HBO host (one that ended with Mr. Maher’s donating $1 million to the pro-Obama SuperPAC Priorities USA). Yahoo! said this special has generated more than 2 million streams and that it hopes to add more such shows, seeing stand-ups as an inexpensive but powerful way to build brand identification with viewers.“Musicians can have personas,” said Erin McPherson, who is Yahoo’s head of video programming and originals, “but comics are themselves, and their fans relate to them almost as friends. They have that intimate, one-on-one connection.”Mark Greenberg, a former Showtime and HBO executive who is now the president and chief executive of Epix, a cable and online network that focuses on movies and live events, said that programmers’ interest in stand-up was partly demographic: comedians bring more male viewers and especially desirable younger viewers, whom programmers can’t afford to ignore “unless your attitude is that you’re going to be retired in 10 years and you don’t care,” he said.Still, Mr. Greenberg was skeptical that other comedians would be able to duplicate the online sales results that Louis C. K. enjoyed.“There’s no bigger report card than pay-per-view,” Mr. Greenberg said. “The first person that does 30,000 buys instead of 200,000, that person’s going to sit there and say, ‘Why did I fail?’ And it’s going to affect them as an asset.”Not every comedian sees the Internet as the salvation of the stand-up special. Patton Oswalt, a comic who often appears in film and television roles, said that by being transparent about their production budgets, Louis C. K. and other Web pioneers had taught him a lesson he could apply to future televised specials.But Mr. Oswalt, whose last special was jointly paid for by Showtime and Comedy Central, said that if he did an online-only special it would be “when I’m ready — I’m not going to do that model because it’s the fashion right now.”Louis C. K. said his next special might not follow the Internet model. “I think there’s huge potential,” he said, “but potential means there might be nothing.”And Mr. Gaffigan said he was not staking his entire career on his Web experiment, predicting he could still license his new performance to Comedy Central if it flopped online.“It’s a gamble with the crops,” he said. “This is one harvest. You’re going to use some piece of equipment that could make it twice as productive.”That said, Mr. Gaffigan would still prefer success to failure. “Just to be clear,” he said, “I have four children, and they’re very young, and I have a woman who gets pregnant looking at babies.”'"

"'12-03-21,'0','Starting on Monday, the Supreme Court will consider constitutional challenges to the Affordable Care Act, hearing arguments about Congressional authority to mandate the purchase of health insurance by individuals and threats to states’ sovereignty by an expansion of state obligations under Medicaid.Although not likely to be struck down in its entirety, the law will continue to face stubborn opposition accompanied by lingering charges that “death panels” will ration health care.Many Americans mistakenly believe that Canada and Britain ration care while we do not. In reality, we also ration care, not through waiting lists but through high prices that impede access for those with no or limited insurance.This inconvenient truth has been twisted into a convenient lie by reform opponents to confuse the public. The specter of rationing has also been invoked by those seeking to repeal the Independent Payment Advisory Board — a panel that would recommend ways to lower Medicare costs — so that Congress and special interests may retain firm control over Medicare spending cuts. By delegating responsibility to independent experts, such a board would help depoliticize the existing process.Lost in the rhetoric is the Affordable Care Act’s efforts to reduce rationing through mandatory coverage of preventive services and essential minimum benefits. The act holds promise for more rational allocation and consumption of scarce resources. But first, we must accept the fact that rationing already exists but needs to be made more equitable if we are to achieve better health for our citizens and better value for our health care dollars.The writer is a professor of health policy and management at Boston University School of Management and executive director of its Health Policy Institute.'"
"'12-03-21,'0','But the timing, location and intensity of the Damascus clashes suggested that diplomacy had made little headway in resolving the conflict. By contrast, the Syrian Army appeared to have advanced significantly in recent days against rebel enclaves around the country, from the northern city of Idlib to Dara’a in the south, the birthplace of the protests that began last March.As the uprising has grown ever bloodier, international human rights investigators have assailed the Syrian authorities for the bulk of abuses, saying those by armed opponents of Mr. Assad are on a lesser scale.But, accusing the opposition of abuses, the New York-based Human Rights Watch said on Tuesday in an open letter to the Syrian National Council, the main umbrella opposition group, that some armed attacks by opposition fighters were motivated by religious and sectarian sentiments arising from the association of some communities with government policies.“The Syrian government’s brutal tactics cannot justify abuses by armed opposition groups,” said Sarah Leah Whitson, director at Human Rights Watch. “Opposition leaders should make it clear to their followers that they must not torture, kidnap or execute under any circumstances.”Human Rights Watch also repeated that it had documented widespread violations by Syrian government forces, “including disappearances, rampant use of torture, arbitrary detentions and indiscriminate shelling of neighborhoods.”The letter said antigovernment groups reported to be carrying out abuses “do not appear to belong to an organized command structure or to be following” the orders of the opposition’s exiled political leaders in the Syrian National Council.In Monday’s fighting in Damascus, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, an opposition group based in , said its informers had reported that at least 18 members of the security forces were killed. The official SANA news agency put the toll much lower, saying one member of the security forces and two opposition fighters were killed in a raid on a “hide-out of an armed terrorist group” in the affluent district.It was impossible to independently corroborate the differing accounts because of government restrictions on outside reporting in Syria. But residents and activists reached by telephone and said it was extraordinary to see such clashes in a well-defended area of Damascus so close to crucial security installations and the homes of powerful figures.“It’s the first time something happened so close and so loud,” said a businesswoman, reached by telephone, who lives a short drive from the center of the fighting and who declined to give her name. “We stayed awake and couldn’t sleep till around 5 a.m.”The fighting started around 2 a.m. or 3 a.m. with several explosions, activists and residents said, followed by automatic-weapons fire and helicopters circling with searchlights, in a wealthy area of the Mezze district that is home to businesspeople, United Nations offices and diplomatic residences. was seen rising near an upscale supermarket and the high-rise Tala Tower, decorated with a seven-story image of a smiling Mr. Assad.One resident reached by telephone said he had heard three explosions and seen exchanges of gunfire between two buildings near the tower, a residential building and another where security forces had been positioned. The resident, who gave his name only as Moaz, said that the battle lasted three hours and that government forces evacuated the residential building and cut the power before mounting a raid.“We had a terrible night,” said another nearby resident who was reached by telephone. The woman, in her mid-30s, said she was too afraid to send her daughter to school.Mezze, sometimes spelled Mezzeh, is a sprawling area on the western edge of Damascus, one of the first city panoramas that greets visitors arriving on the Damascus-Beirut highway named for , the president’s father, who ruled for 30 years.The West Villas section of Mezze, where the early-morning clashes took place, is a neighborhood of stand-alone houses across the highway from a military airport. It is home to wealthy Syrians of a mix of ethnic backgrounds and political persuasions, many of whom lead cosmopolitan lives and have a foothold abroad, in the form of business or dual citizenship.To its north is Mezze 86, a less wealthy area home to many members of President Assad’s minority Alawite sect, members of the security forces and, some residents say, the pro-government gangs known as shabiha that have been unleashed against the opposition. Activists with the Local Coordinating Committees, a coalition of Syria-based opposition groups, reported that large numbers of security vehicles and shabiha members were deployed there by midday on Monday.Mr. Assad has described his opponents as armed terrorists financed from abroad. But his willingness to engage with Mr. Annan and allow for the possibility of outside aid to civilian victims of the conflict has raised the possibility of a temporary halt to the violence.In , Russia’s foreign minister, Sergey V. Lavrov, met with the president of the , Jakob Kellenberger, and both agreed that providing aid to all Syrians was an “absolute priority at the given stage,” the Foreign Ministry said in a statement on Monday. The statement said Russia and the were urging both the Syrian government and opposition forces to “immediately agree to a daily humanitarian pause” that would allow convoys to provide medical care and evacuation for the wounded.Russian officials on Monday also denied an ABC News report that one of their warships had docked in the Syrian port of Tartus with a squad of Russian antiterrorism marines; the report fed speculation that Russia was actively helping Mr. Assad by supplying military experts.A spokesman for the Defense Ministry was quoted by the Interfax news service as saying that he was perplexed by the report, which he said might have referred to the Iman, a Russian tanker that had docked in Tartus 10 days earlier. He said security guards were aboard the Iman because it supplies fuel to Russian ships participating in international antipiracy patrols in the Gulf of Aden.'"

"'12-03-22,'0','“I think it’s huge — I really do,” said Dan Maffei, who is running to reclaim a House seat in a Democratic-leaning upstate New York district from Ann Marie Buerkle, the Republican who unseated him in 2010. “To be running in a Middle American district with lots of seniors who understand how Medicare works on a platform of privatizing Medicare, it’s fitting a round peg into a square hole.”Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, the chairman of the budget committee, pleaded for restraint.“We can’t afford to keep acting like politicians,” he said. “This country needs leaders, and what leaders do is they see a problem on the horizon, they know what it’s going to do to their country and their children and they stop it from happening.”But as more information emerged on the Republican budget, opposition continued to grow. Under questioning, the Republican staff director of the budget committee, Austin Smythe, said the budget was likely to cut transportation financing by $40 billion to $50 billion in the coming fiscal year alone. White House officials said steep domestic spending cuts would push 200,000 children from Head Start, while denying access to food assistance to 1.8 million infants, children and pregnant and post-partum women.“I’m happy that you introduced this document,” said Representative Bill Pascrell Jr., Democrat of New Jersey, as the Budget Committee began its drafting. “I’m happy to run against it, politically, economically, any way you want.” A California Democrat, Representative Michael M. Honda, urged his colleagues to “reject the radical, regressive Republican notion that the only way to maintain sustainability is to cut every program indispensable to the American people.”Republicans say the plan’s failure will consign the country to what Mr. Ryan called “debt and decline.” But as they portrayed themselves as the responsible adults in the room making the hard choice, they were muddying the waters with simultaneous attacks on Democrats for their own Medicare cuts.Asked whether the National Republican Congressional Committee would campaign on the Ryan budget, its spokesman, Paul Lindsay, said it was focused on attacking Democrats for $500 billion of Medicare cuts in the 2010 health care law.On the House floor, Republicans pressed legislation to repeal the Independent Payment Advisory Board, a group of independent advisers created by the health care law and empowered to find ways to hold down Medicare costs. The bill is expected to pass Thursday.And a new conservative group, American Doctors for Truth, broadcast advertisements in Florida and Texas that showed President Obama pushing an elderly woman out of her wheelchair and over a cliff. The ad was patterned on a similar one that ran last year in a special House election in upstate New York.“We felt obligated as physicians to step forward and start a dialogue with the American people,” said Dr. Jane Hughes, an ophthalmologist in San Antonio who is one of the physicians financing the ad.The Ryan budget will go no further than the House. The Democratic-controlled Senate will not take it up, and Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the majority leader, has said he has no intention of bringing a budget to a vote for the third straight year.But the Ryan plan’s most immediate problems will come from the right. Representative Tim Huelskamp, Republican of Kansas, said the plan did not cut spending as much as he promised he would in his maiden run for Congress in 2010. He also objected to “reneging” on the debt deal of July, which promised more than a trillion dollars in cuts to domestic and defense programs if a broader deficit control agreement could not be reached.“It’s good, but not good enough,” he said.'"
"'12-03-22,'0','A onetime journalist, Mr. Fehrnstrom joined Mr. Romney’s political team in 2002, quitting his job at an advertising agency on a day he was writing a press release about the spicy menu at Popeye’s Fried Chicken. He quickly became known for his aggressive manner with reporters. In a testy 2008 exchange with an Associated Press reporter immortalized on YouTube, Mr. Fehrnstrom chided, “Save your opinions and act professionally!”“Classic Fehrnstrom,” said Kevin Madden, another adviser to Mr. Romney. “He doesn’t hesitate for a second to defend his boss.”During a post-debate spin session last year, it was Mr. Fehrnstrom who twisted the knife after Rick Perry’s now-famous brain freeze.“Nothing I say could darken the night Rick Perry had,” Mr. Fehrnstrom deadpanned to the reporters around him.But Mr. Fehrnstrom’s role has expanded over the years from a public one into a backroom one. It was Mr. Fehrnstrom, aides said, who thought to dig into the financial records of Mr. Gingrich, where the campaign’s researchers found that the former House speaker had invested in housing giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. That allowed Mr. Romney to later quip in a debate, “Have you checked your own investments?”Now, Mr. Fehrnstrom serves as a kind of validator for the many consultants and advisers who have been drawn into Mr. Romney’s presidential orbit. “When Eric trusts you, it helps you build the relationship with the governor,” Mr. Madden said.“Governor Romney holds out Eric’s counsel almost above all else,” said Gail Gitcho, the campaign’s communication’s director. “He certainly is keeper of the Romney record. He’s been there from Day One.”But Mr. Romney is no longer Mr. Fehrnstrom’s only focus, and that fact has proved problematic at times.  After Mr. Romney’s failed presidential campaign in 2008, Mr. Fehrnstrom opened up his own political consulting firm called the Shawmut Group. His first client: Scott P. Brown, who — with Mr. Fehrnstrom’s help — claimed the seat of the late Senator Edward M. Kennedy for Republicans.Last summer, as he prepared to help Mr. Brown begin his re-election campaign, Mr. Fehrnstrom secretly donned a fake Twitter identity to mock Alan Khazei, then a Democratic Senate hopeful. Using the handle “CrazyKhazei,” Mr. Fehrnstrom for weeks wrote mocking and sometimes nasty missives, anonymously.It was not until he accidentally tweeted one of his snarky notes about Mr. Khazei under his own, nonanonymous Twitter account that he was forced to fess up.The incident was a minor embarrassment to Mr. Romney, who shrugged it off, according to other close aides. Several people in the current Romney inner circle said Mr. Fehrnstrom’s “Etch A Sketch” comment prompted no dressing down either.Mr. Fehrnstrom continues to balance his duties to Mr. Romney and Mr. Brown. But it is Mr. Romney who is trying to become the Republican standard-bearer, with a shot at the White House. And so Mr. Fehrnstrom has become a target.In January, Mr. Axelrod and Mr. Fehrnstrom engaged in their first of what has become occasional Twitter wars, shooting mildly snarky messages back and forth.“Sometimes you don’t need a picture to tell a story,” Mr. Fehrnstrom tweeted to Mr. Axelrod. “The numbers speak for themselves — 1.7 million jobs lost under Obama.”“Dude, none of my business,” Mr. Axelrod responded. “But shouldn’t you be in debate prep instead of trying to explain yourself to me?”An overly modest Mr. Fehrnstrom had the last word: “Haha! Believe it or not, the economy is an issue where we don’t prep Mitt, he preps us.”'"
"'12-03-22,'0','Not everyone in Christine C. Quinn’s hometown went to kindergarten when she was growing up in the early 1970s. Her family parish, St. Patrick’s, in Glen Cove, N.Y., on Long Island, did not even enroll students for parochial school until first grade.But Ms. Quinn, the City Council speaker and a hopeful for mayor of New York, said that her mother, Mary Callaghan Quinn, made sure she never missed an educational opportunity and drove her to and from the public school a mile away. (She went to parochial school the next year.)“There was mandatory kindergarten in my house,” recalled Ms. Quinn, 45, with a burst of laughter, while sorting through a pile of family photos in her City Hall office one recent morning. “Let me be perfectly clear, there wasn’t a choice.”Ms. Quinn has emerged as the city’s champion of kindergarten attendance since announcing in her State of the City address last month that she intends to make school mandatory for all 5-year-olds in New York. Under current city and state law, children do not have to enroll until the first grade, though in reality the vast majority of them begin with kindergarten. This year, there are 68,245 kindergartners in the city’s public schools.Ms. Quinn and her staff have worked behind the scenes in recent weeks to line up the support of Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, city education officials and state legislators. Assemblywoman Catherine Nolan, a Queens Democrat, and State Senator John J. Flanagan, a Long Island Republican, plan to introduce a bill in Albany that would grant New York City authority to require kindergarten for all 5-year-olds. If approved, it could take effect as early as this fall.Nationally, 16 states and the District of Columbia require students to attend kindergarten according to data compiled by the Education Commission of the States. In New York State, only Syracuse has received legislative approval to require all children to attend kindergarten; school officials there said they had received no complaints about the policy.'"
"'12-03-22,'0','And while they had alerted Commissioner Bud Selig to the growing intensity of their settlement talks with the trustee, Wilpon and Katz waited until early Saturday, the day after the settlement was reached, to tell him so as to avoid any leaks before Monday.The timing of the share sales and loan payments underscores a point that Wilpon and Katz have long emphasized: many of the team’s troubles were separate from their personal and business legal entanglements with the trustee. But it also raises questions about how they found $60 million to pay for stakes in a team they already control — and why they waited until just before the settlement to spend it.With the probability of a settlement growing, and the threat of hundreds of millions of dollars in damages fading, the owners may have felt confident enough to release that money. And it is possible that if the team’s performance improves over the next few years, the owners could resell the shares at a profit.In a statement released Tuesday, the team declined to discuss the share sales with any specificity.Although the sale of the team shares and the Madoff settlement were distinct events, it is clear that the Mets lost a source of friendly financing when Madoff was arrested in late 2008 for orchestrating one of the largest Ponzi schemes in history. The Mets’ owners suddenly had more than $500 million wiped out — and no one to provide the improbably consistent returns on the capital they invested with him.Once Madoff was in jail, the team’s financial troubles began to cascade. The team lost $9 million in 2009 and $51 million in 2010, by which time the trustee had filed suit against Wilpon and Katz. Days before the suit was unsealed in February 2011, Wilpon said he was looking to sell a noncontrolling stake of 20 to 25 percent in the team.Wilpon came close to selling a third of the team to the hedge fund manager David Einhorn, but when that collapsed last September, he decided to sell 10 to 12 limited partnerships for $20 million each. The delay caused by the demise of the Einhorn deal pushed the Mets to borrow the $40 million from Bank of America.Ultimately, the Mets’ owners bought three of those shares — the first two, Wilpon said recently, and a third more recently — and Time Warner Cable and Comcast, who are partners in SNY, bought two shares each to help the team steady its finances. In exchange, they extended certain elements of their network deals.Another share was bought by Robert W. Pittman and Kenneth B. Lerer, two media moguls.A ninth share was purchased by the hedge-fund billionaire Steven A. Cohen, who is in the midst of trying to buy the Los Angeles Dodgers. If he succeeds, he will have to sell his stake in the Mets.The identities of the remaining three new shareholders are not publicly known.Their money will be warmly welcomed. The Mets lost $70 million last season, and although the payroll has shrunk by about $50 million, the team made no significant signings in the off-season even as the Miami Marlins and their other division rivals improved their rosters.'"
"'12-03-22,'0','Investors were effectively paying the German government to keep their money safe — as holders of United States Treasury bonds have been doing in recent years. (Holders of Treasuries are also now experiencing a similar decline in the market value of their haven assets.)The change in European sentiment is good news for Italy and Spain because it means at least some investors no longer regard their bonds as impaired.Italy’s 10-year bond was yielding 4.9 percent Wednesday — still a higher interest rate than Germany’s, but well off the 7 percent interest rates and more that investors were demanding that Italy pay last November.But there is a dark side for European banks, which have loaded up on haven bunds the last two years. Europe’s 90 biggest banks had holdings of German government debt that regulators valued last June at 489 billion euros ($645 billion).Some analysts even speak of a bursting bund bubble.“The bund is probably the most widely held asset in European banks,” said Carl Weinberg, chief economist at High Frequency Economics in Valhalla, N.Y. “Any further decay in a widely held asset like bunds would be unwelcome, and would contribute to a contraction in credit that I think is the next big problem for Europe.”One problem is that many banks booked gains from German bonds when they underwent official stress tests last summer. The profits helped offset other losses and reduced pressure on the banks to raise more capital. It could be a problem for some banks if those bund profits proved to be ephemeral.Some economists and European policy makers have watched the decline in German bonds with concern.Otmar Issing, the former chief economist of the European Central Bank, who remains influential with central bankers, said in a conference in Frankfurt on Tuesday that the price of bunds and United States Treasuries had become “distorted” because of their haven status.Peter Praet, a member of the executive board of the European Central Bank, said at the same conference that banks had been benefiting until recently from the safety status of their German bonds, which made it easier for them to satisfy regulators’ demands that the banks reduce risk.As a sign of the bunds’ rising value on the open market last year, the yield on the 10-year bunds went from about 3.5 percent in April to as low as 1.67 percent in September. Now some of those gains are turning into losses.“What is the potential impact of that distortion?” Mr. Praet asked.The answer is probably that no one knows. Detailed information on banks’ current bond holdings is lacking.Many will certainly benefit from the recovery by Italian and Spanish bonds, as well as the return of relative calm to European financial markets. But any big shift in such a huge market, especially when prices had reached levels widely considered to be extreme, offers a potential for disruption.Much depends on how much more bund prices fall, and their yields rise.Gianluca Salford and Aditya Chordia, analysts at J.P. Morgan in London, forecast in a note to clients this week that the yield on the 10-year bund would not rise above 2.2 percent. That would be about the same level as in December.Some analysts even say that moderately higher yields on German bonds would be healthy. The resulting decline in the value of the bonds “is not necessarily pleasant news for German banks,” which have large holdings of their own country’s debt, said Nicolas Véron, a senior fellow at Bruegel, a research organization in Brussels.But, “I’m not too worried given the levels we have which are not very high,” Mr. Véron said. “If we went to significantly higher bond yields, 3 or 4 percent, it would be an entirely different situation. But we’re not there and I’m not sure we’re going there.”An auction of German bonds on Wednesday showed that they retain their allure.The government sold debt maturing in two years at a yield of 0.31 percent. Shorter-term bonds almost always have lower interest rates than longer-term bonds. That was up from 0.25 percent at the previous auction on Feb. 22, but still well below the 0.51 percent that buyers bid last September.Germany also further burnished its reputation as a fiscally prudent country on Wednesday, as Chancellor Angela Merkel’s cabinet approved a budget plan that aims to cut the government deficit to just 0.35 percent of gross domestic product in 2014, two years earlier than previously planned.The ratio was 1 percent for 2011 — compared with 8.5 percent for Spain.And yet, a disruptive lurch in German bond prices is still a risk. Hedge funds and asset managers, who are the most active traders, stand to make immense profits by dumping German bunds and buying longer-term bonds from so-called peripheral countries like Spain and Italy.These investors are betting that the worst of the debt crisis is over, and yields of peripheral country debt will continue to fall in relation to German debt.“If you time this right, this will continue being the trade of the year,” said Mark T. Müller, a managing director at Credit Suisse in Frankfurt who specializes in debt. “Bunds are probably overvalued and some other countries are undervalued. There is money on the table.”The most common explanation for the rise in German bond yields is that they are coming back to more normal levels as fear of a euro zone Armageddon subsides.But another reason for the yield surge may be that investors see potential weaknesses in Germany. If the crisis heats up again, as many analysts say it will, Germany is the country that would bear the greatest share of the cost. Its creditworthiness could then slip.“Whenever there is a disbursement to a Greece program or a Portuguese program, Germany is on the hook for roughly one quarter of the bill,” said Mr. Weinberg of High Frequency Economics.He is also skeptical about another premise for Germany’s status as a refuge from the financial crisis: that it has a robust economy. Mr. Weinberg noted that the German economy shrank in the last quarter of 2011, and that recent data shows a slowdown in orders to German manufacturers.“Based on the numbers I see,” Mr. Weinberg said, “the notion that Germany is safe as an economy doesn’t hold any water.”'"
"'12-03-22,'0','Federated and other investors are betting that in 2012, the housing market will emerge from its doldrums. Government and industry data on housing have generally shown improvement for several months, although that may vary regionally. Prices are still depressed, but sales and permits to start new construction have picked up, though they are not near their peaks of 2005.On Monday, the National Association of Home Builders said that its housing market index, which measures the outlook for home builders, held steady at 28 in March from the same level in February, its highest level in five years. While still far below the 70s it reached in 2005 during the housing boom, the index has doubled in the last six months.On Tuesday, economic data showed that builders requested 5.1 percent more permits in February but broke ground on fewer units. On Wednesday, a report from the National Association of Realtors said that sales of previously owned homes declined 0.9 percent in February from January but that they were still at their second-highest level in 21 months. The median sales price for an existing home rose 0.3 percent to $156,600 in February, compared with a year earlier.Diane Swonk, the chief economist for Mesirow Financial, said in a research commentary that pent-up demand for housing was clearly rising but that problems obtaining mortgages were limiting a recovery and would push more potential buyers into renting.“Over all, it shows the housing market is improving, but still it is depressed,” said Patrick Newport, an economist with IHS Global Insight.One of the biggest problems hanging over the market is the glut of foreclosed properties, which has pushed down prices of new and existing homes. For the home builders, the question is how much the backlog will damp demand for new homes. High unemployment and stricter lending standards are also limiting sales.The recent rise in shares is “one of the biggest moves in the last few years,” said Joel Locker, a home builders analyst with FBN Securities. “But it has always been a sentiment-driven sector, and fundamentals change at a turtle pace. You might have started to turn the battleship around, but it takes a while.”Home builder shares lost half their value when the housing market crumbled in 2007 and dropped further during the financial crisis of 2008-9. All last week and through Wednesday, the S.& P. home builder index closed higher than 300 for the first time since March 2009, though it is still far from its peak of over 600 in early 2007. The gains have outperformed the stock market’s overall broad measure, the S.& P. 500, which has risen 27 percent since the beginning of October.The companies whose share prices are performing best this year tend to be those that in 2011 were viewed by investors as having excess debt or weaker profit margins and that now have the most to gain from an improved housing market, said Adam Rudiger, a senior analyst at Wells Fargo Securities. The underperforming companies, on the other hand, generally have stronger balance sheets, or higher levels of cash and less debt.Hovnanian Enterprises’s shares rose from $1.03 in early October to $2.83 on Wednesday. The home builder, which posted a loss of about $18 million in the first quarter, has slashed its work force, bought land for future housing development and reduced its debt.The company reported increases in contracts in recent months and a good start to the spring season. But it is too soon to say whether the housing market is rebounding, said J. Larry Sorsby, the chief financial officer for Hovnanian, which is based in Red Bank, N.J.“The jury is still out,” Mr. Sorsby said. “I don’t think anyone can say for sure, but we remain cautiously optimistic.”'"
"'12-03-22,'0','The Inter-American Court of Human Rights ruled that Chile must pay damages to a judge who was denied custody of her three daughters by the Supreme Court in 2004 because of her sexual orientation. The ruling by the human rights court, a judicial entity of the Organization of American States, requires Chile’s government to pay the judge, Karen Atala, left, $50,000, in addition to $12,000 in court costs. The February ruling, which was made public on Wednesday in Chile, is the latest development in a multiyear legal battle waged by Judge Atala, a lesbian who had lost custody of her daughters to her ex-husband, also a judge. Judge Atala’s lawyer called the decision “historic” for Chile’s legal system. Justice Minister Teodoro Ribera said Wednesday that Chilean authorities had acted to protect the “superior interests of the children involved,” but he also said Chile would respect the ruling.'"
"'12-03-22,'0','Claims of ineffective assistance at trial are commonplace even though trials take place under a judge’s watchful eye. Challenges to plea agreements based on misconduct by defense lawyers will presumably be common as well, given how many more convictions follow guilty pleas and the fluid nature of plea negotiations.Justice Scalia wrote that expanding constitutional protections to that realm “opens a whole new boutique of constitutional jurisprudence,” calling it “plea-bargaining law.”“The Supreme Court’s decision in these two cases constitute the single greatest revolution in the criminal justice process since Gideon v. Wainwright provided indigents the right to counsel,” said Wesley M. Oliver, a law professor at Widener University, referring to the landmark 1963 decision.In the context of trials, the Supreme Court has long established that defendants were entitled to new trials if they could show that incompetent work by their lawyers probably affected the outcome. The Supreme Court has also required lawyers to offer competent advice in urging defendants to give up their right to a trial by accepting a guilty plea. Those cases hinged on the right to a fair trial guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment.The cases decided Wednesday answered a harder question: What is to be done in cases in which a lawyer’s incompetence caused the client to reject a favorable plea bargain?Justice Kennedy, joined by Justices , , and , acknowledged that allowing the possibility of do-overs in cases involving foregone pleas followed by convictions presented all sorts of knotty problems. But he said the realities of American criminal justice required to the court to take action.Some 97 percent of convictions in federal courts were the result of guilty pleas. In 2006, the last year for which data was available, the corresponding percentage in state courts was 94.“In today’s criminal justice system,” Justice Kennedy wrote, “the negotiation of a plea bargain, rather than the unfolding of a trial, is almost always the critical point for a defendant.”Quoting from law review articles, Justice Kennedy wrote that plea bargaining “is not some adjunct to the criminal justice system; it is the criminal justice system.” He added that “longer sentences exist on the books largely for bargaining purposes.”One of the cases, Missouri v. Frye, No. 10-444, involved Galin E. Frye, who was charged with driving without a license in 2007. A prosecutor offered to let him plead guilty in exchange for a 90-day sentence.But Mr. Frye’s lawyer at the time, Michael Coles, failed to tell his client of the offer. After it expired, Mr. Frye pleaded guilty without a plea bargain, and a judge sentenced him to three years.A state appeals court reversed his conviction but said it did not have the power to order the state to reduce the charges against him. That left Mr. Frye roughly where he started, with the options of going to trial or pleading guilty without the benefit of a plea deal.Justice Kennedy wrote that Mr. Frye should have been allowed to try to prove that he would have accepted the original offer. But that was only the beginning of what Mr. Frye would have to show to get relief. He would also have to demonstrate, Justice Kennedy wrote, that prosecutors would not have later withdrawn the offer had he accepted it, as they were allowed to do under state law. Finally, Justice Kennedy went on, Mr. Frye would have to show that the court would have accepted the agreement.There was reason for doubt that Mr. Frye could prove that prosecutors and the court would have ended up going along with the original 90-day offer, as Mr. Frye was again arrested for driving without a license before the original plea agreement would have become final.Justice Scalia, in a dissent joined by Chief Justice and Justices and , called all of this “a process of retrospective crystal-ball gazing posing as legal analysis.”The second case, Lafler v. Cooper, No. 10-209, concerned Anthony Cooper, who shot a woman in in 2003 and then received bad legal advice. Because all four of his bullets had struck the victim below her waist, his lawyer incorrectly said, Mr. Cooper could not be convicted of assault with intent to murder.Based on that advice, Mr. Cooper rejected a plea bargain that called for a sentence of four to seven years. He was convicted, and is serving 15 to 30 years.Justice Kennedy rejected the argument that a fair trial was all Mr. Cooper was entitled to.“The favorable sentence that eluded the defendant in the criminal proceeding appears to be the sentence he or others in his position would have received in the ordinary course, absent the failings of counsel,” he wrote.A federal judge in Mr. Cooper’s case tried to roll back the clock, requiring officials to provide him with the initial deal or release him. Justice Kennedy said the correct remedy was to require the plea deal to be re-offered and then to allow the trial court to resentence Mr. Cooper as it sees fit if he accepts it.Justice Scalia, here joined by Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Thomas, said this was “a remedy unheard of in American jurisprudence.”“I suspect that the court’s squeamishness in fashioning a remedy, and the incoherence of what it comes up with, is attributable to its realization, deep down, that there is no real constitutional violation here anyway,” Justice Scalia wrote. “The defendant has been fairly tried, lawfully convicted and properly sentenced, and any ‘remedy’ provided for this will do nothing but undo the just results of a fair adversarial process.”Stephanos Bibas, a law professor at the and an authority on plea bargaining, said the decisions were a great step forward. But he acknowledged that it may give rise to gamesmanship.“It is going to be tricky,” he said, “and there are going to be a lot of defendants who say after they’re convicted that they really would have taken the plea.”Justice Kennedy suggested several “measures to help ensure against late, frivolous or fabricated claims.” Among them were requiring that plea offers be in writing or made in open court.'"
"'12-03-22,'0','Home sales fell in February, the National Association of Realtors said Wednesday, but upward revisions to the previous month’s rate and the first yearly increase in prices in 15 months suggested the housing market recovery remained on track.The association said existing home sales slipped 0.9 percent to an annual rate of 4.59 million units last month.Still, last month’s sales rate was the second highest since May 2010.Some economists said smoothing out the data to account for the extra day in February might have contributed to the surprise drop in sales last month. Economists polled by Reuters had expected sales to rise to a rate of 4.62 million.“We compared the February 2012 seasonal adjustment factor to past leap years, and it appears that the seasonal adjustment was fairly aggressive,” said Ellen Zentner, an economist at Nomura Securities in New York. “Using last year’s seasonal adjustment factor instead of this leap year’s, existing-home sales would have actually risen by 3 percent month on month, to 4.77 million units.”Despite the drop in sales, the report added to signs of a tentative recovery in the housing market, with the median home price rising 0.3 percent from a year earlier, to $156,600 — the first yearly increase since November 2010.Since hitting a bottom of about 4.05 million units in July, home resales have largely held up. Compared with February last year, sales were up 8.8 percent.'"

Its stock fell 5.8 percent to $45.04, its lowest close since mid-December.The S.& P. 500 energy sector index was off 1 percent.In a report on Wednesday, Goldman Sachs argued that the prospects for future returns in equities relative to bonds were as good as they had been in a generation.”Given current valuations, we think it’s time to say a ‘long goodbye’ to bonds, and embrace the ‘long good buy’ for equities as we expect them to embark on an upward trend over the next few years,” Goldman Sachs said.The bond market, however, rallied on Wednesday after last week’s sharp sell-off. The price of the benchmark 10-year Treasury note rose 19/32, to 97 13/32, while its yield dropped to 2.30 percent from 2.36 percent late Tuesday.The Dow Jones industrial average fell 45.57 points, or 0.35 percent, to 13,124.62 at the close. The S.& P. 500 dipped 2.63 points, or 0.19 percent, to 1,402.89. The Nasdaq composite index edged up 1.17 points, or 0.04 percent, to 3,075.32.Advancing issues were almost evenly matched with decliners on both the Big Board and the Nasdaq.Shares of Hewlett-Packard, a Dow component, fell 2.2 percent, to $23.46, after it said it was merging its printer and PC businesses in a reorganization to cut costs and increase growth.Oracle’s shares fell 2.3 percent to $29.41 after earlier climbing to a session high at $31.15. The world’s No. 3 software maker beat Wall Street’s earnings estimates late Tuesday.Nasdaq got a lift from Green Mountain Coffee Roasters, whose shares shot up 10 percent to $55.79 after the company said it would carry Starbucks-branded coffee in packs designed for its new line of brewers, increasing its efforts to protect its lead in the single-cup coffee market in the United States.Earlier, data showed home sales fell in February, but upward revisions to January’s pace and the first yearly increase in prices in 15 months suggested the recovery in the housing market remained on track.An index of housing stocks rose 0.5 percent and is up 26.6 percent so far this quarter.The stock market’s recovery started last October as investors saw ways to avoid a dire situation in the European debt crisis that threatened the global economic recovery. But analysts see a shift in investor sentiment that could translate into more market gains.“We believe that the bull market is transitioning from an advance based on crisis resolution toward one driven by expanding risk appetite stemming from mounting evidence of a more durable, self-sustaining economic expansion,” said Carmine Grigoli, chief investment strategist at Mizuho Securities U.S.A., in a note to clients.'"
"'12-03-22,'0','ATHENS — The Greek government on Wednesday appointed the deputy finance minister to run the ministry temporarily after his boss resigned to lead the country’s Socialist party.Filippos Sachinidis, 48, a Canadian-born economist, worked closely with the former finance minister, Evangelos Venizelos, who resigned Monday, in negotiating Greece’s second financial bailout, which was approved early this month.He is to be finance minister until general elections, which are expected in late April or early May, the prime minister’s office said.Mr. Sachinidis was widely expected to get the job. He was deputy finance minister in the previous Socialist government of George A. Papandreou and an adviser in the office of another Socialist premier, Costas Simitis, from 2000 through 2004.Local news media had speculated that Prime Minister Lucas D. Papademos might take on the task, in the manner of his Italian counterpart, Mario Monti. The interior minister, Tassos Yiannitsis, a veteran Socialist, also was mentioned.'"
"'12-03-22,'0','Back in England, women are spending more pounds on beauty, including the services of the facialist Sarah Chapman, who opened Skinesis Clinic in London’s Chelsea 10 years ago. Eve Lom, a favorite of beauty editors who has made inroads in the United States market, “is like the grand doyenne of English skin care,” Ms. Kinnaird said. “Sarah is who is next.”Ms. Chapman introduced a house-named beauty line three years ago, positioned somewhere between the no-nonsense dermatologist lines and the luxury botanical-based brands. The signature product, Skinesis Overnight Facial, is a serum that blends peptides with exotic-smelling essential oils.“Before, there was a really strong identity to French or Swiss skin care,” Ms. Chapman said in a telephone interview from London. “Now there is a shift to British lines, and the U.S. customer is much more open to that. Part of it is because those French lines are still where they were 10 years ago. They are like spa brands, and it’s not enough. The customer has moved forward.”Ms. Chapman said she was pleasantly surprised by the traction she has found in the American market. Skinesis sold well in its debut on QVC’s American channel last year, and she is in talks to continue that relationship. “The Americans and the English feel more connected,” she said. “Maybe it’s the language, but it’s also the approach. Especially with New York City and London, there’s the drive to be at the forefront.”But English lines are also masters of heritage branding. At Min New York, a beauty boutique in SoHo that specializes in fragrances, Mindy Yang, the company’s vice president, walked through a dark wood interior, decorated with Chesterfield-style leather tufted sofas, that could’ve passed as Oscar Wilde’s living room.The store’s English perfume selection included Miller Harris (a relatively young brand by Lyn Harris), Penhaligon’s (circa 1870) and Taylor of Old Bond Street, a men’s line with unisex appeal that was established in 1854, during Queen Victoria’s reign. “For Americans, British brands speak to this elegant, dandyish lifestyle — there’s always this grand story — and with etiquette,” Ms. Yang said. “I think people miss etiquette. They’re looking for a real connection.”Besides “Downton Abbey,” Ms. Yang mentioned the rekindled interest in British royalty after Prince William and Kate Middleton’s wedding last summer as a possible reason that people are buying more English scents. Penhaligon’s Bluebell, a fragrance favored by Princess Diana, is a best-seller, as is the Blenheim Bouquet, a bracing citrus concoction inspired by Winston Churchill.The perfumes tend to be literal. According to Ms. Yang, there’s usually an aromatic, or herbal note, and lots of citrus and floral notes, as if dousing one’s pulse points with a liquefied English garden. “French scents are more like accessories,” she said. “They can be very complex and esoteric. British scents are very wearable. It’s confidence in simplicity.”Jo Malone of London, a fragrance company that began from casual kitchen concoctions and is now owned by Estée Lauder, shares a similar sensibility, with unisex scents like lime basil and mandarin.Many fans of English brands tend to be professionals, like doctors and lawyers who can wear only subtle scents to work, Ms. Yang said. Others are nostalgic travelers. “Some of our American customers want to ‘revisit’ that place they went on a trip,” she said of British scents like Taylor of Old Bond Street’s Eton College cologne.Indeed, Ms. Kinnaird introduced Beautannia, an in-house bath line, last November, with scents named after British locations, including Bloomsbury, Balfour and Brideshead. May will bring Brighton, a seaside scent with notes of sea moss and grapefruit.Rococo Nail Apparel, a three-year-old London nail-polish brand also stocked at Space NK, named its spring collection Garden Party. It was founded by two sisters, Ange and Vernice Walker, who have created polishes for Roland Mouret and Burberry runway shows and become known for creative hues like T-Cup, a popular powder blue with a subtle gold sheen.“It was inspired by an actual teacup with the light blue pattern with gold rim,” said Ange, the older sister.In May, Rococo will introduce the Rock and Royal threesome, which features an intense blue, shimmery red and sheer white. The hues were created for the 60th anniversary of the queen’s accession to the British throne in June.“In New York, it’s all about Kate and Will,” Vernice said. “Everybody is watching what Kate will wear.”But then again, the new nail polishes could also work nicely for the Fourth of July.'"

"'12-03-23,'1','The tear in the muscle, as Wright has described it, is not particularly severe. And because he has primarily felt stiffness, not all-out pain, Wright has said he would very likely have played through this sort of injury had it occurred in the regular season.But there is a sense of wariness with Wright because he has become, on a few levels, the Mets’ most indispensable player. The team will need a high level of offensive production from him after a 2011 season unsteadied by a frustrating back injury. They also need his leadership, particularly with such an inexperienced group of players.“To have the guy who I consider the face of this organization out there, I think, is really important,” Manager Terry Collins said of Wright. “Not only do we need his skills on the field, we need his energy and the way he plays the game on the field, too.”Wright, who had been limited to hitting balls off a tee and from soft tosses until Thursday, went through the normal warm-up routine with his teammates starting at 9:30 a.m., before taking batting practice at Digital Domain Park.He looked relaxed as he took his rotations at the plate, swinging smoothly and lacing line drives deep into the outfield. He said he was making all of his normal throws across the field from third base.The move from hitting baseballs inside to taking batting practice outdoors was a small but significant step, Wright said.“I’ve been in the cage for a little bit of time now,” he said. “Today was the next step, going on a field, because it’s a little more energy, you exert a little more.”Wright’s schedule will be based on how he responds each day. Collins said Thursday that he would need to see Wright complete four or five more full workouts before having him play in any games.Wright acknowledged that he would be squeezing significant work into a short time. He has not played in any sort of full-speed game after being scratched from the Mets’ first intrasquad scrimmage.But he said he was not particularly concerned with his lack of game action.“That’s something you can make up, whether on the minor league side or kind of cram it in the last couple of weeks, so I’m not overly concerned with that,” Wright said. “I’m more concerned with how I’m going to feel tomorrow, doing the same thing tomorrow. But so far, so good.”The Mets beat the Houston Astros, 8-2, at Digital Domain Park and improved their Grapefruit League record to 5-12-1. ... R. A. Dickey made his fourth start of spring training and allowed just one run and one hit over six and one-third innings. ...

Initially, only two of the seven teenagers involved were charged with crimes, and one of those was reduced to simple assault.This week, with more of the case against the teenagers unveiled, it became clear that they had been going into Jackson looking for blacks to harass and assault since at least April, often targeting drunk or homeless people they thought would be less likely to report the crimes.Mr. Anderson, who had locked his keys in his truck and who appeared to be intoxicated, was standing near his vehicle in a parking lot of the motel just off the highway when the teenagers attacked him.His family argued against the death penalty in the case and urged that the matter be used to promote racial reconciliation in the city.Sentencing on the federal charges is not likely to take place for months. Meanwhile, investigators said they were continuing to examine the involvement of the other four people who were in the parking lot that night.“I think the prosecutors hope the pressure will mount,” said Morris Dees, co-founder of the Southern Poverty Law Center, who has also helped Mr. Anderson’s family file a wrongful death lawsuit against the seven.Mr. Dees said Mr. Dedmon was likely to serve what is expected to be a 50-year sentence in federal prison before beginning his state sentences.“It would be dangerous for him to serve his time in a Mississippi state prison that has a predominantly black population, given the nature of these crimes,” he said.'"
"'12-03-23,'1','“We played as well as we can play,” Boeheim said, “and that’s why we won the game.”The Orange (34-2) showed the resilience and toughness they displayed in close games all season, withstanding one final possession by fourth-seeded Wisconsin (26-10) in which it had two shots that could have won the game. But Dion Waiters played good defense on Wisconsin’s Jordan Taylor on the first shot and Josh Gasser air-balled a desperation 10-footer at the buzzer.After hitting six consecutive 3-pointers in one stretch, the Badgers missed their final five and did not score a field goal in the final four minutes.“We knew that if you live by the 3 you’re going to die by it someday,” said Syracuse guard Scoop Jardine, who had 14 points. “And they died by it.”Taylor and Gasser fell to the floor after their misses, while the Orange celebrated wildly at the end of a strange game. Both teams finished a blistering shooting night by not scoring a field goal in the final 4 minutes 48 seconds.The Orange won by shooting 55 percent from the field, led by an unexpected performance from the junior forward C. J. Fair (15 points) and a typical jolt of energy from Waiters (13). Wisconsin was led by Taylor and Jared Berggren with 17 points each.“This is one of the best games I’ve been involved with in a long time,” Boeheim said.Wisconsin cut Syracuse’s lead to a point on two free throws by Gasser with 31 seconds left. When Kris Joseph missed the front end of a one-and one for the Orange — usually a tortured free-throw-shooting team — with 18 seconds to go, it conjured up ghosts of tournament nightmares past. But the Orange survived.Fair had not scored in double digits since Feb. 22 and shot 1 for 10 from the field in Syracuse’s first two tournament games, against North Carolina-Asheville and Kansas State. But Fair was Syracuse’s most efficient and effective player, scoring 15 points while shooting 7 for 9, with a team-high 7 rebounds.Some of Fair’s most impressive rebounding work helped compensate for the loss of the suspended center Fab Melo. Fair may have grabbed the biggest defensive rebound of the night, off a missed shot by Wisconsin’s Rob Wilson, with two minutes remaining and Syracuse clinging to a 64-61 lead.Jardine said it was good to see Fair get his “powers back.”Orange guard Brandon Triche added: “To see the smile back on his face, to see the confidence. He was out there making moves.”At times, especially when the Orange built a 10-point lead in the first half, the TD Garden sounded like a New England version of the Carrier Dome. Syracuse fans dominated the arena and will probably have an even more pronounced presence Saturday after scooping up tickets from fans of the losing teams Thursday.Boeheim played down any potential advantage, however. “It’s always nice to have your fans,” he said, “but they don’t score.”Syracuse scored just enough to survive. It will be rewarded with the equivalent of a home game Saturday for a spot in the Final Four.'"
"'12-03-23,'1','MEXICO CITY — After weighing the risks of traveling to Mexico, the parents of one American teenager decided to allow her to join a school trip to Oaxaca, where students volunteered at an orphanage, visited archaeological sites and sipped vanilla milkshakes on the honey-colored town plaza.The fact that the parents were President Obama and the first lady, Michelle Obama, and that the teenager was their daughter Malia, thrilled Mexican tourism officials, who are trying to redefine the country’s image as it has struggled with drug violence.“It’s a compliment that the daughter of President Obama and her friends have decided to live the experience of Oaxaca,” said José Zorrilla, the state secretary for tourism and economic development, slipping into promotion mode.Each updated travel advisory from the United States State Department is painted as an affront here. Especially galling to Mexicans was the spring break warning issued by the Texas Department of Public Safety suggesting that Texans avoid Mexico altogether.Plenty of Americans are ignoring the government warnings. Last year, Mexico reported a record year for foreign visitors, 22.67 million, and most of them were American.'"
"'12-03-23,'1','The campaign has two goals. One is to encourage visits to the NV200 taxi that will be on display at the 2012 New York International Auto Show, to be held at the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center from April 6 to 15. (Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, who advocated the contest to redesign the cabs that cruise the streets of his city, and Carlos Ghosn, chief executive of Nissan Motor, are to appear with the NV200 at an event on April 3.)The other goal of the campaign is to connect in the minds of consumers the selection of the Nissan van with what has been the theme of the Nissan campaign since August 2010, “Innovation for all.”The NV200 is “evidence of innovation,” Mr. Schwartz said, from an automaker that is “really trying to develop fresh ideas.”In fact, the taxi campaign serves as a curtain-raiser for a separate campaign that will also begin on Monday. The second campaign heralds the arrival in Nissan showrooms of what are described as “five all-new models over the next 15 months,” beginning with Altima and continuing with Pathfinder, Sentra, a hatchback Versa and Rogue.Nissan North America plans to add $100 million to its ad budget to market those five models as they arrive. The company spent $496.5 million to advertise Nissan models last year, according to the Kantar Media unit of WPP, up from $459.1 million in 2010 and $341.2 million in 2009.Nissan’s efforts are not unusual for the automotive industry, which is trying to take advantage of a growing interest among consumers in buying cars and trucks again after they delayed the purchase of big-ticket items for several years. Automakers typically spend more money each year on advertising in the United States than any other category of marketer.“We’ve known that in midyear 2012 we would start an onslaught of product launches,” said Jon Brancheau, vice president for Nissan marketing at Nissan North America in Franklin, Tenn.The campaigns are meant to “drive a stake in the ground,” he added, “and build on our momentum.” The Nissan brand in the United States set a record last year with sales of 944,073 vehicles, an increase of 17.3 percent from 2010.It was not so long ago that an association with New York City was something brands shunned rather than saluted. But with less crime, more students applying to colleges here and record numbers of tourist visits, the Big Apple has become a big draw for marketers.“We have been amazed at the level of interest around the world in the taxi,” Mr. Brancheau said. For instance, the Nissan operation in China “has asked that the display vehicle” from the auto show “be sent there” for exhibition once the show has ended, he added.And the NV200’s victory in the competition is cited in ads in other countries for the regular versions of the van, a light commercial vehicle that Nissan Motor sells in Asian and European markets. “If it can make it in New York,” one ad says, “it can make it anywhere.”A couple of ads in the taxi campaign explicitly link the contest to the Nissan brand theme. “Innovation for NYC,” one headline reads. Another ad asserts that the cab “goes to the corner of innovative and cool.” (Although some may wonder if a vehicle that resembles a minivan can be deemed cool.)Other ads are lower key and humorous. “All hail,” one headline declares. Another confides: “Kept it yellow. Changed everything else. Nissan taxi of tomorrow. Coming 2013.” A third ad calls the NV200 “Taxi 2.0.”An element of the campaign that may draw attention is a billboard with an oversize sliding door, evoking the doors of the van. “The future of the auto industry?” the headline asks. “We can take you there.”And there are plans to give away to passers-by near the Javits Center foam fingers that can be used to hail cabs rather than root for sports teams. There will also be giveaways of gift cards worth $15 to apply toward cab rides.'"
"'12-03-23,'1','This latest leg of Mr. Wiley’s world tour starts with a portrait of a young Ethiopian-Israeli man, “Alios Itzhak” (2011), set against a pattern borrowed from a 19th-century Eastern European mizrah, a papercut made to be placed on a wall to indicate the direction of Jerusalem for purposes of worship. The portrait, acquired by the museum, is joined by 13 additional paintings of young men by Mr. Wiley, along with 11 historic papercuts and textile works he selected from the museum’s collection.Like Alios Itzhak, most of the other portrait subjects are shown in their street clothes and painted against elaborate patterns from traditional Jewish art. T-shirts advertising YouTube or sportswear companies are juxtaposed with decorative motifs like lions, birds and arabesques that wrap around the figures, moving from background to foreground. The result is a fusion of Pattern and Decoration painting with figuration, a mash-up or sampling of historical styles and references.One canvas, “Kalkidan Mashasha” (2011), does feature a hip-hop-reggae artist, who is painted in a light brown military shirt with patches depicting the Ethiopian flag and commemorating Haile Selassie, the last emperor of the Ethiopian monarchy and a deified figure in Rastafarian culture. Meanwhile, cases nearby quietly display intricately painted mizrahs and textiles from 19th-century Italy, Poland and Ukraine.There are some good elements to this show, and some problems. On the positive side, the Jewish Museum has been in the vanguard of showing contemporary art. The exhibition provides an opportunity to exhibit the work of an African-American while celebrating the Jewish diaspora’s diversity and Israel as a “melting pot” (to quote the catalog).And yet the show raises some difficult questions. For instance, what is the position of the Ethiopian Jew in Israeli society? The gallery installation gives the impression of Jewish culture as a seamless visual narrative, slipping faultlessly from old Europe to modern-day Tel Aviv. It also posits, particularly in a video accompanying the paintings, Israel as a haven for persecuted Ethiopian Jews.In the catalog, however, Mr. Mashasha, who cites thinkers and activists like Frantz Fanon, Malcolm X, Nelson Mandela and Marcus Garvey as influences, states, “I am struggling with the issue of not becoming what I criticize, not to be racist if others are, not to perceive things simply because I’m sensitive and I’m black.”Another question is why Mr. Wiley’s work focuses solely on young men, when many of the textiles on view were made by women, and, as the catalog informs us, one of the best-known Israelis of Ethiopian descent is a female singer named Hagit Yaso, who won last year’s edition of an Israeli show similar to “American Idol.”Part of the answer is that Mr. Wiley has generally painted preening young men, and there is a strong homoerotic element in his work that is glossed over here.It’s not necessary to label him as a gay artist — or an African-American one — to understand or appreciate his work. And yet this omission speaks to the way Mr. Wiley has been packaged: as a slightly titillating but not too radical artist whose work nods toward racial and sexual taboos, but is safe enough to be shown just about anywhere. (This is reflected in the paintings themselves, which look particularly bland and factory-produced when viewed up close.)Perhaps the greater problem is that Mr. Wiley’s work gains its currency by leaning on hip-hop for cultural authenticity, but veers away from what gives that medium its extraordinary power. In Mr. Wiley’s hands, one of the most vital and viral idioms of the last quarter-century becomes safe and palatable, a domestic product that has been successfully exported around the globe and re-enters American art as fashion or style, largely stripped of its political and emotional charge and dressed up with extraneous decorative motifs.Just as music critics have complained of hip-hop’s becoming a corporatized global commodity, Mr. Wiley can be accused of using it to neutralize differences and difficulties like those cited by Mr. Mashasha in the catalog. And it is those very difficulties that we rely on art to broach.'"
"'12-03-23,'1','“Lured by Visions of Real Estate Profits, Nonprofit Group Stumbled” (news article, March 15) suggested that the Community Preservation Corporation “strayed” from its mission by providing “luxury” housing. This is not so.In building and preserving more than 147,000 housing units during its 37-year history, C.P.C. took many risks to support the varied and changing needs of the communities it serves — rebuilding deteriorated low- and moderate-income neighborhoods in New York City, revitalizing downtowns in upstate New York, stabilizing failing middle-income cooperatives, creating “work force” housing — hardly “luxury” — for middle-income families, and restoring the 12,271-unit housing complex at Parkchester.During the 1990s, as new housing units in New York City failed to keep pace with the population increase, building “work force” housing for families earning between $90,000 and $130,000 became an important part of the city and state’s housing agenda, as it did for C.P.C.C.P.C. provided such housing without using public subsidies by financing condominium buildings whose average projected sales price was affordable to households earning in the above income range.C.P.C., like all residential lenders, was affected by the depth of the recession. For the first time it experienced significant losses, which, I believe, it has so far absorbed with its own resources.C.P.C. has been an extraordinarily productive and important vehicle for affordable housing. I expect that it will build on this legacy and play a central role in creating affordable housing in the years ahead.'"
"'12-03-23,'1','The changes are intended to allow analysts to more quickly identify terrorism suspects. But they also set off civil-liberties concerns among privacy advocates who invoked the “Total Information Awareness” program. That program, proposed early in the and partially shut down by Congress after an outcry, proposed fusing vast archives of electronic records — like travel records, credit card transactions, phone calls and more — and searching for patterns of a hidden terrorist cell.But national security officials stressed that analysts could already get the same information under the old rules, just in a more cumbersome way. They cited safeguards to protect against abuse, including audits of searches. The same rules apply to access by other federal agencies involved in counterterrorism.“There is a genuine operational need to try to get us into a position where we can make the maximum use of the information the government already has to protect people,” said Robert S. Litt, the general counsel in the office of the Director of National Intelligence, which oversees the National Counterterrorism Center. “We have to manage to do that in a way that provides protection to people’s civil liberties and privacy. And I really think this has been a good-faith and reasonably successful effort to do that.”The center has developed a priority list of databases it wants to copy entirely, but he and other officials declined to say which ones they were. (The says it has already shared several entire databases, including records related to refugees, foreign students and international travelers.)“We’re all in the dark, and for all we know it could be a rerun of Total Information Awareness, which would have allowed the government to make a computerized database of everything on everybody,” said Kate Martin, the director of the Center for National Security Studies, who criticized the administration for not making the draft guidelines public for scrutiny ahead of time.The guidelines were also signed by the director of national intelligence, , and the director of the center, Matthew G. Olsen.The previous guidelines for sharing information with the counterterrorism center were issued by Attorney General in 2008.They set up three tracks by which the center could retrieve information gathered by another agency: by doing a limited search itself for certain data, by asking another agency to perform such a search, or — in cases whether neither was sufficient — by replicating the database and analyzing the information itself.The new guidelines keep that structure in place, but put greater emphasis on the third track, while also relaxing restrictions on how long data on Americans who have no known tie to terrorism may be stored. The old guidelines said data on innocent Americans must be deleted promptly, which the agency interpreted to mean if no tie to terrorism was detected within 180 days.The new guidelines are intended to allow the center to hold on to information about Americans for up to five years, although the agencies that collected the information — and can negotiate about how it will be used — may place a shorter life span on it.Moreover, the first two tracks for searching the databases that remain under the control of the original agencies prohibit “pattern analysis.” But that restriction does not apply to databases the center has copied.Marc Rotenberg, executive director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, voiced concerns about how the guidelines would interact with proposals to give the government greater access to telecommunications information in order to protect critical infrastructure from hackers.The new rules are silent about the use of commercial data — like credit card and travel records — that may have been acquired by other agencies. In 2009, Wired Magazine obtained a list of databases acquired by the , one of the agencies that shares information with the center. It included nearly 200 million records transferred from private data brokers like ChoicePoint, 55,000 entries on customers of Wyndham hotels, and numerous other travel and commercial records.Intelligence officials offered a hypothetical scenario to explain one way the change could be helpful: A person from applies for a visa and lists an American as a point of contact. There is no sign that either person is a terrorist. Two years later, another person from Yemen applies for a visa and lists the same American, and this second person is a suspected terrorist.Under the existing system, they said, to discover that the first visa applicant now had a known tie to a suspected terrorist, an analyst would have to ask the State Department to check its database to see if the American’s name had come up on anyone else’s visa application — a step that could be overlooked or cause a delay. Under the new rules, a computer could instantly alert analysts of the connection.'"
"'12-03-23,'1',', alarmed about the threat to stability in a region seething with discontent over religious and cultural controls, has responded with an assortment of heavy-handed measures. Officials have described the self-immolators as outcasts and terrorists, blamed the pernicious influence of Tibetan exiles and flooded the region with checkpoints and paramilitary police officers in flak jackets.Communist Party leaders have also introduced a “monastic management” plan to more directly control religious life. As part of the plan, 21,000 party officials have been sent to Tibetan communities with the goal of “befriending” monks — and creating dossiers on each of them. Compliant clergy members are rewarded with health care benefits, pensions and television sets; the recalcitrant are sometimes expelled from their monasteries.At some temples, monks and nuns have been forced to publicly denounce the , the exiled spiritual leader whose name is often invoked by self-immolators. The freedom of movement that allowed monks to study at distant monasteries across Tibet and four adjacent provinces has been curtailed.“They claim we are free to practice our religion but in fact they keep pulling the reins tighter and tighter so we can hardly breathe,” said a 22-year-old monk from Qinghai Province, who like many Tibetans keeps banned pictures of the Dalai Lama in his room and on his cellphone.Senior officials have trumpeted the new approach, which includes the distribution of one million national flags and portraits of and other party leaders — with a requirement that they be displayed at homes and monasteries. “Temples have undergone a delightful change since the new management methods were put into place,” Xinza Danzengquzha, a top Tibetan official, said this month in Beijing.Such measures, however, may be having the opposite intended effect. Robert Barnett, director of the Modern Tibet Studies Program at , said that the government’s more intrusive approach to monasteries, the heart of Tibetan society, is a reversal of self-management policies put in place in the 1980s. “History suggests it is unlikely to work,” he said.The antipathy, never far beneath the surface, is erupting into plain view with greater frequency. In the past week, several protests have broken out, including two in Qinghai Province that were led by students angry over the introduction of Chinese-language textbooks for subjects like chemistry, math and geography. In January, exile groups say 31 people were shot, at least one fatally, when police officers opened fire on demonstrators in Drango County, in Sichuan Province. In Diru County, in the Tibet Autonomous Region, 20 of the 22 monasteries have been closed, according to the Tibetan Center for Human Rights and Democracy.Spasms of unrest have coursed through modern Tibetan history with some regularity since 1959, when the Dalai Lama fled to after a failed uprising. Between 1987 and 1989, the region was rocked by protests that were brutally crushed. The most recent crackdown began in March 2008, when rioting in , the Tibetan capital, led to the death of at least 19 people, most of them Han Chinese. In the weeks and months that followed, exile groups say a far greater number of Tibetans died.But Tibetan scholars and exiles say the current resistance campaign is unlike anything seen before. The tactic — public, fiery suicides that do not harm bystanders or property — has profoundly moved ordinary Tibetans and bedeviled Chinese officials. Just as significant, they note, is that the protesters are mostly young — all but nine of them under 30.Tsering Kyi was one of them. According to family members, she was a thoughtful student whose hard work earned her a place on the school’s honor roll. But in 2010, she joined classmates who took to the streets of this dusty county seat to protest the new Chinese-language textbooks and the decision to limit Tibetan to a single class. In the clampdown that followed, several teachers suspected of encouraging the protest were fired and the headmaster, a popular Tibetan writer, was sent to work on a dam project, according to local residents.Tsering Kyi’s death has been widely publicized by Tibetan activist groups eager to draw attention to the self-immolations. The Chinese state news media, which has ignored most of the cases, reported that she was mentally unstable after hitting her head on a radiator. Her grades started to sag, the official Xinhua news agency said, “which put a lot of pressure on her and made her lose courage for life and study.”In interviews, several Tibetan residents and relatives of Tsering Kyi’s contemptuously waved away such assertions. Instead, they were eager to discuss her devotion to her Tibetan heritage and the final moments of her life. When she emerged from the public toilets in flames, they said, the market’s Han Chinese vegetable sellers locked the front gate to prevent her from taking her protest to the street. No one, they claim, tried to douse the fire.When the police arrived, they forced witnesses to remain inside the market and returned Tsering Kyi’s body to the bathroom. Then, after collecting everyone’s cellphones, they methodically went through the devices and deleted any photographs of the incident.In interviews last week with two dozen monks and ordinary Tibetans in Qinghai and Gansu Provinces, many said that they expected the fiery suicides and protests to continue to spread beyond Aba, the county in Sichuan Province where the majority of the self-immolations have taken place. “From the outside, everything looks so pretty here, but on the inside, everyone is boiling.” said one lama at a monastery in Rebkong, a major tourist draw in Qinghai famous for its intricate thangka paintings.The lama, who asked for anonymity because speaking to foreign reporters can lead to severe punishment, said monks were expected to attend “patriotic education” sessions that consist of pro-government propaganda. “I don’t want trouble with the authorities, but I can’t control their rage any longer,” he said of the monks.In Gansu Province, security at the sprawling Labrang Monastery was visibly tighter, and emotions more raw. Monks there said the accumulation of indignities, years in the making, was followed by two days of street protests in 2008 that led to a wave of detentions and beatings.Many Tibetan monks are unable to get passports and the Han, they said, often treat them with contempt. “We can’t even speak our minds on the phone because the police are listening in,” said one 39-year-old who ducked into a reporter’s hotel room to share details about life for Labrang’s 1,400 monks.He described how the police had raided the white-walled monastery complex one night as everyone slept, kicking in doors, smashing computers and tearing up photographs of the Dalai Lama. At least 180 monks were detained that night. “They ran out of handcuffs, so they started tying our wrists with rope they found in the monastery,” he said.The monks were eventually released but Labrang, one of the most important religious sites in Tibetan Buddhism, is a changed place. Video surveillance cameras hang from the eaves of hallowed temples and plainclothes police officers mingle with the faithful. “They never fool us because they hold their prayer beads with their right hand, and every Tibetan knows to hold them in their left hand,” one monk said.'"
"'12-03-23,'1','Outfitted in caps and gowns, the singer Nellie McKay and her musicians trouped onto the stage of Feinstein’s at Loews Regency on Tuesday evening with mischievous smirks on their faces. Along with the show’s title, “Silent Spring — It’s Not Nice to Fool Mother Nature,” the costumes signaled what was ahead: a zany homemade one-woman musical comedy with an educational agenda and more wardrobe changes to come.The caps and gowns, which were soon discarded, suggested a collective graduation from naïveté about nature and the world we inhabit into a more complex awareness. Ms. McKay personified a contradiction: an ingenuous naïf with a torch singer’s sophistication. This alter ego became a fairy-tale version of her show’s heroine, the pioneering conservationist Rachel Carson who died in 1964.Ms. McKay is a protean talent who asks a lot of an audience. Her broad conceptual leaps from song to song can be daunting. When is she being sweetly sarcastic and when unabashedly nostalgic? It’s not always clear. When she accompanies herself on ukulele, she comes across as a precocious child playing in Toyland.On one level, the show is an admiring biographical gloss of Carson’s career as a writer and proto-environmental activist, with a strong feminist subtext.On another, it embodies Ms. McKay’s far-reaching vision of popular music as a level playing field on which everything from rap to jazz to Irving Berlin has equal status, and the lines between standards and contemporary pop and jazz dissolve.A rendition of Charles Mingus’s jazz instrumental “Fables of Faubus,” played by her band (Alexi David on bass, Kenneth Salters on percussion, Cary Park on guitar, and Tivon Pennicott on saxophone and flute) may be the first time the piece has been heard in a cabaret.'"
"'12-03-23,'1','In addition, the bill requires lawmakers to disclose the purchase or sale of stocks, bonds, commodities futures and other securities within 45 days of transactions, rather than once a year as they now do. The information will be posted on the Web.Thousands of federal agency officials, including many at the White House, will be subject to similar reporting requirements.The bill — the Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge Act, or Stock Act — originated in the Senate. But House Republican leaders rewrote it, and the Senate on Thursday accepted the changes.Watchdog groups and some lawmakers said the changes had weakened the bill by killing two important provisions that were added last month after a freewheeling debate on the Senate floor in early February.One provision would have regulated a growing industry that collects “political intelligence” from political insiders for the use of hedge funds, and other investors. The second provision dropped from the bill would have given prosecutors powerful new tools to pursue public corruption cases.The Senate majority leader, , Democrat of , said Republicans had blocked efforts to go to a conference to negotiate differences with the House.A handful of lawmakers, led by Representative , Democrat of New York, have tried for years to enact restrictions on stock dealing by members of Congress. Their efforts drew little support until new attention to the practice last year — coupled with election anxiety — prompted a flood of backing for the idea and support from Mr. Obama.The renewed push for the legislation was led by two of the newer senators, , Republican of , and , Democrat of New York.“Those who make the laws should live under the same laws as everyone else,” said Mr. Brown, who like Ms. Gillibrand is running for re-election.Senator , Republican of , who helped write the bill, explained the surge in support. “At a time when public confidence in Congress is at an all-time low,” Ms. Collins said, “we must remove any doubt that the law and rules against insider trading apply to members of Congress.”Federal securities law does not explicitly exempt members of Congress, but experts disagree on whether and when lawmakers may be found to have violated the existing insider trading ban. The bill is meant to eliminate ambiguity, though lawyers said prosecutions would still be difficult.The legislation says that lawmakers owe “a duty arising from a relationship of trust and confidence” to Congress, the federal government and citizens of the , a duty they violate by trading on “material nonpublic information.”The is investigating the buying and selling of stock options by Representative Spencer Bachus, Republican of , who is chairman of the House Financial Services Committee. He predicted last month that he would be exonerated.The bill passed by Congress also requires lawmakers and executive branch officials to disclose the terms of on their homes. It prohibits them from receiving special access to initial public stock offerings. And it will deny federal pensions to members of Congress who are convicted of felonies involving public corruption.But the proposed regulation of “political intelligence” firms was scrapped, over the objections of Senator , Republican of . Mr. Grassley said that people who troll for political intelligence and sell it to Wall Street should register and disclose their clients, as lobbyists have long been required to do.Rejection of this proposal was “a victory for Wall Street and a defeat for the American people — a victory for the hedge funds and big that like the secrecy of the status quo,” Mr. Grassley said.However, critics, like the House Republican leader, of , said the definition of political intelligence was exceedingly vague. As a result, they said, the registration requirement could have applied to people seeking information from their members of Congress about the status of legislation.Mr. Lieberman, chairman of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, said he wanted to know more about political intelligence gathering. “There may be a problem here,” he said, “but it needs more thoughtful study,” to ensure that regulation would not infringe on First Amendment rights.Under the bill, the comptroller general of the United States will conduct a one-year study of “political intelligence and the extent to which investors rely on such information.”The three no votes were cast by Senators of , of and Mr. Grassley, all Republicans.Mr. Grassley said he supported the insider trading ban, but wanted to restore his proposal on political intelligence.'"
"'12-03-23,'1','WASHINGTON — The American intelligence community warned in a report released Thursday that problems with water could destabilize countries in North Africa, the Middle East and South Asia over the next decade.Increasing demand and competition caused by the world’s rising population and scarcities created by climate change and poor management threaten to disrupt economies and increase regional tensions, the report concludes.Prepared at the request of the State Department, the report is based on a classified National Intelligence Estimate completed last October that reflected an increasing focus on environmental and other factors that threaten security. An estimate reflects the consensus judgment of all intelligence agencies.While the report concluded that wars over water are unlikely in the coming decade, it said that countries could use water for political and economic leverage over neighbors and that major facilities like dams and desalination plants could become targets of terrorist attacks. Coupled with poverty and other social factors, problems with water could even contribute to the political failure of weaker nations.The public report, unlike the classified version, did not specify countries at greatest risk for water-related disruption but analyzed conditions on major river basins in regions with high potential for conflict — from the Jordan to the Tigris and Euphrates to the Brahmaputra in South Asia.'"

One of its tracks, Los Alamitos, had the nation's fifth-highest rate.Twenty-seven states in this analysis allow betting on horses at tracks and “racinos.” Most of the tracks with the highest incident rates are in the Southwest.Five of the seven tracks with the nation’s highest incident rates are in New Mexico. Four tracks are unaccredited, and enforcement of drug violations is relatively lenient.Ruidoso Downs had the nation’s highest overall rate from 2009 to 2011. Race officials there claim that the track’s high altitude (about 6,900 feet) is partly to blame.Rarely did a track have more than two incidents per day.

"'12-03-24,'0','The police later arrested three people, and said one of them, a prostitute, had visited Mr. Lewis on Feb. 26, and her boyfriend and another man followed and killed him. “That story seems all wrong,” Andrea said.But more urgently, she thought, what would become of his dog, named Zeus? He had loved that dog.Andrea called the 45th Precinct in the Bronx. A detective told her that the dog had been taken to the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. This is a common mistake, as she learned when she called the A.S.P.C.A., which directed her to the city’s center.The center often receives animals — sometimes several — after a crime or police action. “Drug busts, people dying in their apartment, homicide of owners, owners arrested,” said Ms. Bank. “It runs the gamut.” If nobody comes forward to claim an animal, the center sends letters to the owner’s house, even if the owner is dead, in hopes that a relative will open the mail. The shelter urges pet owners, especially the elderly, to stick a note on the refrigerator with pet instructions in case of an emergency.After Andrea’s call, the shelter was able to identify which dog was Zeus. She said she wanted to adopt him. No, the shelter said. He could only be released to the owner’s next of kin. Andrea did not know any of Mr. Lewis’s family. The dog was not doing well. “He was in an isolated distress room,” Andrea said. “His pupils were dilated and he was barking like crazy.”FOR three weeks, Zeus spent most of his time in a kennel in a room with 23 other dogs. The kennels are arranged back to back, so the dogs don’t see one another. He had a blanket and a toy. He was taken to a yard behind the shelter to play with volunteers as often as possible, Ms. Bank said. Some dogs are walked down 110th Street and around the neighborhood, but Zeus’s fits of barking ruled that out.Finally, Andrea got in touch with Mr. Lewis’s father, who came to New York from Florida after the murder to attend to the many threads left hanging by his son’s death. The dog was one. On Sunday, he and Andrea met at the shelter.“He got there first,” Andrea said. “He was standing on line. You could just tell it was the dad. The eyes, that’s how I knew.”Papers were signed. A microchip was injected under Zeus’s coat. The father had no interest in taking Zeus home. “You could tell he’d been through a lot,” Andrea said. He gave her the dog on Monday and left. “Very proper,” she said of him.The dog has been happy at her home this week, she said. “I felt like Geno was talking to myself and his pup,” she said. “Everything is going to be O.K. now.”'"

"'12-03-24,'0','The Landmarks Preservation Commission designated much of the West Village — a swath of 2,035 brownstones and other buildings on leafy lanes— as a historic district in 1969. Forty-five buildings were added in 2006 and 235 more in 2010. But the commission has not safeguarded the core of the entertainment quarter.By some accounts, a largely unknown Bob Dylan wrote “Blowin’ in the Wind” at the Fat Black Pussycat and could also be heard at the Gaslight, Cafe Wha? and the Village Gate. After gaining fame, he lived in a town house at 94 Macdougal, where the zealous Dylan aficionado A. J. Weberman sifted through and chronicled his garbage. Cafe Wha? is still there, but the long-shuttered Fat Black Pussycat on Minetta Street is now a Mexican restaurant and last year, the owner painted over the Pussycat’s faded sign.“The Village was freedom,” the restaurant’s owner said. “It wasn’t a concreted-over straitjacket.”The comedian Lenny Bruce was arrested in 1964 for using obscenities at Cafe au Go Go at 152 Bleecker and was convicted after a nationally publicized trial focused on the First Amendment. The club lasted until 1969 and was a showcase for acts like the Grateful Dead, but it is now a Capital One bank branch.In the 1950s, beats like Allen Ginsberg, William S. Burroughs, and Jack Kerouac idled at the San Remo at 189 Bleecker, a bar with a pressed-tin ceiling and all the bread and butter one could eat. Legend has it that a drunk Kerouac was once beaten up outside. The spot was most recently an Asian restaurant.Many legendary spots survive. Caffe Reggio, at 119 Macdougal since 1927, still has an intricately carved bench that belonged to the Medicis, a painting from the School of Caravaggio and a coffee machine that is said to have introduced cappuccino to America. Tobia Buggiani, its manager, supports preserving the district.“It’s part of our collective history as Americans, and to watch a lot of it disappear is sad,” he said.But in recent years, many sites have been demolished or replaced with little trace of the past. The Village Gate, the jazz and cabaret spot, is now a CVS drug store, with only a small corner sign recalling the much-admired Jacques Brel musical it hosted. The Bleecker Street Cinema, the art house that Truffaut called “the American Cinematheque,” closed in 1990 and is now a Duane Reade drug store and a FedEx outpost.A longtime home of the Circle in the Square Theater was torn down around 2005 to make way for a nine-story apartment house. The Provincetown Playhouse, which produced Eugene O’Neill’s early plays, is a New York University Law School building, though a portion of the facade has been preserved and a new theater built.A house where Edgar Allan Poe lived has been replaced by another law school building, though a Poe room is open for two hours a week.The row house that held the Sullivan Street Playhouse, where over 42 years “The Fantastiks” became America’s longest-running musical, has been turned into a glass-fronted apartment building.The tenements whose ground floors house the remaining nightclubs — as well as tattoo parlors, tourist trinket shops and pizza and falafel joints — were once home to 19th-century immigrants.Preservationists like Mr. Berman think that era, whose most stalwart emblem is the Shrine Church of St. Anthony of Padua, should be honored, too.Elisabeth de Bourbon, a spokeswoman for the landmarks commission, said it had not scheduled any hearings on expanding the Greenwich Village historic district, but she suggested there was no rush to do so.“While alterations to buildings in a potential historic district are a cause for concern,” she said in a statement, “our experience has shown that changes involving only one or a small number of buildings relative to the overall size of a large district do not diminish the integrity of the neighborhood as a whole, or affect the district’s eligibility for designation.”Other intrinsic factors protect the district, including its relatively low-rise zoning and rent-regulation laws that make it difficult for developers to oust protected tenants.Mr. Berman argues that time may indeed be important because the South Village will be affected by two nearby developments — a planned N.Y.U. expansion and a rezoning of Hudson Square west of Avenue of the Americas.“Our fear is that this neighborhood is going to get squeezed between these two massive rezonings,” he said, “and that will increase development pressure in an already fragile neighborhood.”'"

"'12-03-24,'0','Israel’s foreign minister, Avigdor Lieberman, told Army Radio on Friday that Israel was weighing its steps, “including ending all cooperation with the council.”Nabil Abu Rudeineh, a spokesman for Mahmoud Abbas, the president of the Palestinian Authority, said, “This is a new international position that supports Palestinian rights and sends a message to Israel from the international community that settlements are illegal and should be stopped in total.”The United Nations and much of the world considers the settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, territories that Israel captured from Jordan in the 1967 Middle East war, as a violation of international law. Continuing growth in the settlements has been a continuing frustration for the Obama administration. Its 2009 demand that Israel freeze construction yielded a 10-month moratorium, but it expired and the Palestinians will not return to talks without a new freeze.Israel has agreed to dismantle some small, unapproved settler outposts in the West Bank, but maintains that those settlements it has officially approved are legal and that their fate must be settled in bilateral negotiations with the Palestinians.Hostility between Israel and the council peaked in 2009 when a fact-finding mission led by Judge Richard Goldstone investigated Israel’s three-week offensive in Gaza that ended that January, and published a scathing report concluding that both the Israeli military and Palestinian armed groups firing rockets against Israel committed possible war crimes. Israel utterly rejected the accusations and in April 2011, Judge Goldstone retracted his statement that Israel had intentionally killed Palestinian civilians in Gaza. Other members of the panel stood by the conclusions of the report.On Thursday, after the council’s resolution passed, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel said: “This is a hypocritical council with an automatic majority against Israel. This council ought to be ashamed of itself. Until today, the council has made 91 decisions, 39 of which dealt with Israel, three with Syria and one with Iran.”The Israeli Foreign Ministry added that the council “ridicules itself” by working “to satisfy the Palestinians’ whims and to harm future chances to reach an agreement through peaceful means.” Further, the ministry said, “The Palestinians must understand that they can’t have it both ways: they can’t enjoy cooperation with Israel and at the same time initiate political clashes in international fora.”Also on Friday, Israel facilitated a delivery of fuel to the Hamas-run Gaza Strip to provide temporary relief for a fuel crisis stemming from a dispute between Hamas and Egypt. Shortages have caused power cuts of up to 18 hours a day in recent weeks.With the situation in Gaza becoming more urgent, and the supply to hospitals threatened, Hamas agreed to the assistance from the West Bank-based Palestinian Authority and Israel as a temporary measure.“This is no solution,” Adham Abu Salmia, a Gaza health official, told The Associated Press.At the request of the Palestinian Authority, which has no access to Gaza, Israel allowed some 450,000 liters of fuel to be trucked through its Kerem Shalom border crossing on Friday, when it is usually closed. Maj. Guy Inbar, a spokesman for the Israeli authority responsible for the crossings, said that amount would be enough for no more than two days.Over the last year, Hamas stopped paying the Palestinian Authority for Israeli-supplied fuel and relied on cheaper fuel smuggled through tunnels beneath the Gaza-Egypt border. In recent months Egypt has tried to end the practice and to have Gaza import fuel from Egypt legally, also via the Israeli border crossing, a request that Hamas refused. Hamas wants the fuel to arrive directly from Egypt to Gaza.Hamas staged protests Friday in Gaza to urge Egypt to let the flow of its fuel resume. Hamas spokesman Mushir al-Mashri called on the Egyptians to open the border with Gaza, The Associated Press reported.'"
"'12-03-24,'0','“I just fell over: ‘Are you serious, stop joking!’ ” Hunter said. “I ran through the little workout facility screaming, ‘We got Pujols!’ ”The reaction reverberated throughout the Angels’ universe. The young leadoff hitter, Peter Bourjos, awoke in Tempe to urgent text messages about Pujols. Bourjos said he got goose bumps.In Newport Beach, Calif., the Angels’ top starter, Jered Weaver, said he woke up and saw 15 text messages on his phone. For a moment, Weaver said he was worried, remembering all the messages he had received when he learned that a teammate, Nick Adenhart, had been killed in a car crash. But his fear subsided quickly.“Once I heard the good news of getting Pujols, I couldn’t help but run around in my underwear, go find my wife and give her a big hug,” Weaver said. “It was pretty exciting, no doubt about it.”The Angels also signed an All-Star starter, C. J. Wilson, that morning. But it was the Pujols announcement that most improved the team’s outlook. After missing the playoffs two years in a row — while the rival Texas Rangers won two American League pennants — the Angels were making a serious push to return.The Pujols deal has substantial risk. He is 32 years old, so most of his prime is probably over. He earned about $113 million over 11 seasons with the St. Louis Cardinals and will make $240 million for the next 10 years with the Angels. Chances are the Cardinals years will be more productive, at less than half the price.Yet the Angels have a fortune in local television revenue coming to them, and they want to retain their hold on Los Angeles fans while the Dodgers are up for sale. The Angels have not reached the World Series since winning it in 2002, and especially in the early part of the contract, with a strong rotation and Pujols at his peak, they have a good chance to return.“When you bring in a player like Albert, you’d like to think you can score a few more runs and win a few more games,” starter Dan Haren said. “As a starting rotation, that stuff’s out of our control. But if we can all just stay healthy, we can do some pretty special things.”If they all stay healthy, the Angels will have a logjam of talented hitters. Last year’s first baseman, Mark Trumbo, hit 29 home runs. Kendrys Morales slugged 34 homers as the first baseman in 2009, but missed most of the last two seasons after breaking his ankle while jumping on the plate in a 2010 celebration.Trumbo could see time at third base this season, and Morales, who played his first exhibition game Thursday, will be the designated hitter. The veteran Bobby Abreu could be an expensive bench player.“The potential is there to be every bit as deep as we’ve ever seen here,” Manager Mike Scioscia said. “More importantly, it’s a lineup that’s going to support a premium pitching staff, and that’s something we struggled with last year. We’re going to be deeper. It doesn’t matter if it’s the deepest lineup we’ve ever had here. Are we deep enough to let these pitchers pitch without their backs to the wall?”The Angels scored only 667 runs last season, their fewest in a nonstrike year since 1992. But they allowed only 633, their fewest in any season since 1989. The bullpen has questions, but with Weaver, Haren, Wilson and Ervin Santana in the rotation, most innings will be well covered. The hope is that Pujols can elevate the hitters.“He’s one of those guys who coaches players,” Hunter said. “He might coach them and doesn’t even know he’s coaching them, because guys are watching everything he’s doing right, and how consistent he is. It’s contagious.“He’s an M.V.P., he’s a World Series champ. His presence changes everything, the way the pitcher pitches to the lineup.”A week into spring training, Bourjos said, Pujols found him in the batting cage and emphasized the importance of planting his front foot earlier, to get an extra split-second to see the pitch. The gesture meant a lot, Bourjos said, showing him that for all of Pujols’s accomplishments, he is simply a normal guy who tries to make his teammates better.With 445 career homers, a .328 average and three Most Valuable Player awards, Pujols might never be considered normal. But he said he was eager to share his wisdom.“It’s part of my responsibility,” Pujols said. “This is what I’m supposed to do, just try to be a leader in whatever aspect of the game, not just on the field, but off the field. That’s something that I learned early in my career through the veteran guys that I played with in St. Louis. I took that from them and it’s time to continue to pass it along to the future of this organization.”'"
"'12-03-24,'0','PROBLEMS WITH MENTORS One of the top complaints about programs aimed at helping entrepreneurs is that they fail to pair people correctly. But I also heard that some of the programs lack focus and clear goals.“If you don’t have good chemistry, you could have a group discussion about spreadsheets but the business owners won’t tell you that they don’t get along with their No. 2 person,” said Bernard H. Tennenbaum, former associate director of the Entrepreneurial Center at the Wharton School and the founding director of the entrepreneurial institute at Fairleigh Dickinson University. “It’s so important for these people to get along,” he said.The UBS-Clinton Foundation partnership aimed to avoid the common pitfalls by focusing on vetting both the mentor and the person being mentored. It also put a UBS financial adviser into the mix to help maintain clearly defined goals that could be accomplished in a short period of time.“We knew from the Clinton Foundation why the business owners wanted to participate ahead of time and so we could make a better match,” said Lori Feinsilver, who runs the program for UBS.Still, Admiral Straw’s experience got off to an inauspicious start. The owner of the first company he was supposed to help did not show up for the introductory lunch. But the next business proved to be a perfect match: Linda Tool, which manufactures precision components for military contractors.Admiral Straw said that the Linda Tool plant in the Red Hook section of Brooklyn was much different from what he expected. The 12,000-square-foot shop was spotless, and the company had won industry certifications for the quality of its products. Michael DiMarino, its president, was managing his inventory, expenses and profits well. On the surface, it seemed as if there would be little for Admiral Straw to do.But Mr. DiMarino said his big problem was that his business had stagnated after the 2008 financial collapse. “I never had to do marketing,” he said. “The 1990s were fruitful years, and the business grew until it just stalled. But the price of everything else kept going up.”Admiral Straw began advising him on how to bid directly with the Department of Defense and military contractors.“I figured we could show him how to go directly to the federal government,” Admiral Straw said. “I took him to the Defense Logistics Agency and got him educated by the head of the small-business office on how to bid directly for the jobs.”PROBLEMS WITH TIMING The timing of the Straw-DiMarino partnership was fortunate. Therese Flaherty, director of the Small Business Development Center at the Wharton School, said she had found that mentoring programs had the greatest impact when mentors came in at a point when the business owners were struggling with something that had stymied their original idea. This usually has something to do with finances or employees.Mr. DiMarino said from 2008 to 2010 he worked hard not to lay off any of his employees. He said he was proud that many of his machinists had been with him for decades. But he had moved to a new, larger space and, he said, he was eager to figure out a way to increase his business since he had the capacity to do more work. Now that he is bidding directly for many contracts, he expects his sales to increase to $5 million this year from $3.8 million in 2011. His experience with Admiral Straw, in other words, has worked out well.K. Y. Chow, who owns GM Printing, was also trying to expand his company. Over 18 years, he had won many city contracts for his printing company, but he moved into a larger plant in Long Island City just as the economy slowed. He wanted to know how to increase his sales beyond the contracts he had.He was paired with Don Terwilliger, president of Digital Color Concepts, a much larger and more established printing company. “The first question was, ‘Tell me the problem I’m having,’ ” Mr. Chow said. “Is it pricing, quality, logistics?”It was sales, since Mr. Chow was the only salesman. He has since hired two additional sales people.DEFINING SUCCESS Mentoring programs often struggle to determine if they have accomplished anything. This is just as important for the mentors who are giving their time as the business owners who need help.Julie Azuma, president of Different Roads to Learning, which sells more than 500 learning aids for children with autism, said she had been trying for two years to find a company that could translate her vision into an app that she could sell. She was feeling frustrated.Yet Ms. Azuma, who has been part of many mentoring programs, said she had her doubts about the adviser and the entrepreneur assigned to help her.“But after we met a few times,” Ms. Azuma said, “there was this feeling of accountability in working with them.”Her mentors focused mainly on helping her create the app, but they also worked with her on improving the way she communicated her business goals. “It was something she dreamed of, and we helped her make it a reality,” said Amy Butte, a former Wall Street executive and Internet entrepreneur who was Ms. Azuma’s mentor.Ms. Butte and Ms. Azuma are still in touch. And this is something the program stressed: after the six months of formal work, the teams are expected to stay in contact for at least six months to help the business owners follow through on what they started.Admiral Straw said he had continued to help Mr. DiMarino, adding that he went with him recently to a job fair for veterans in Stamford, Conn. “What really kept me in it was Mike’s dedication and work ethic,” he said.'"
"'12-03-24,'0','AS the presidential election campaign heats up, two measures of the economic success of President Obama’s administration provide drastically different views of how he has done.His stock market record is among the best of all the administrations that have held office over the last century. But in terms of economic growth, the record is among the poorest.The accompanying chart measures the performance of the stock market and the economy under each administration since Woodrow Wilson was elected in 1912, adjusted for inflation. The measures cover the time from when a president took office until the following campaign got under way.From the fourth quarter of 2008 through the final quarter of 2011, the American economy grew at an annual rate of just 1.4 percent. Of course, the economy declined during the first two quarters of 2009, reflecting the financial crisis and recession that began before Mr. Obama was elected, and has since recovered all of the decline and more. Nonetheless, over comparable periods, the economy performed better in 21 of the previous 24 administrations.But since the presidential inauguration on Jan. 20, 2009, the stock market has risen at an annual rate of 16.4 percent, even after adjusting for inflation. That is better than all but four previous administrations.It is highly unusual for the two measurements to differ so greatly, but there is one similar case. Nearly a century ago, President Wilson took office just as a recession was beginning. The stock market had plunged before he was inaugurated, and the eventual recovery in prices came on his watch. But the decline in the economy during 1914 was not fully overcome until 1916, when spending on World War I brought rapid growth.'"
"'12-03-24,'0','But neither the judge’s order nor the F.D.A.’s expected rule changes are likely to fundamentally alter the large-scale agricultural uses of antibiotics because farmers and ranchers now say the drugs are being used to prevent animal diseases, not to promote growth. The F.D.A. has so far refused to propose restrictions on antibiotic uses to prevent disease even when the drugs are delivered in feed or water, and Judge Katz’s order does not extend to disease prevention uses.Gwen Venable, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Poultry and Egg Association, said that poultry producers “judiciously use antibiotics to maintain the health of their flocks.”“Our association has not had an opportunity to review the judge’s order, so we cannot comment on the impact of the specific decision at this time,” she said.Environmentalists and health advocates cheered Judge Katz’s ruling, as they have largely cheered the F.D.A.’s incremental efforts to begin restricting some of the less discriminating antibiotic agricultural uses because they welcome any improvement in the decades-old issue.“The rise of superbugs that we see now was predicted by F.D.A. in the ’70s,” said Jen Sorenson, a lawyer for the Natural Resources Defense Council.But agricultural trade groups were more critical. Ron Phillips, vice president of public affairs for the Animal Health Institute, an association representing companies that make animal medicine, said that the judge’s order could slow efforts to reduce agricultural uses of antibiotics by diverting resources from the agency’s collaborative efforts with industry.Antibiotics were the wonder drugs of the 20th century, and their initial uses in humans and animals were indiscriminate, experts say. Farmers were impressed by the effects of penicillin and tetracycline on the robustness of cattle, chickens and pigs, and added the drugs to feed and water, with no prescriptions or sign of sickness in the animals.By the 1970s, public health officials had become worried that overuse was leading to the development of killer infections resistant to treatment. In 1977, the F.D.A. announced that it would begin banning some agricultural uses. But the House and Senate appropriations committees passed resolutions against the ban, and the agency retreated.“In the intervening years, the scientific evidence of the risks to human health from the widespread use of antibiotics in livestock has grown, and there is no evidence the F.D.A. has changed its position that such uses are not shown to be safe,” Judge Katz wrote in his order.Eighty percent of antibiotics bought in the are used in animals, not humans. Meanwhile, outbreaks of illnesses from antibiotic-resistant bacteria have grown in number and severity, killing thousands.Environmental and health groups petitioned the F.D.A. in 1999 and 2005 to restart the process to ban the drugs for promoting animal growth. The Natural Resources Defense Council, the Center for Science in the Public Interest , the Food Animal Concerns Trust, and the filed suit against the F.D.A.On Thursday, Judge Katz ruled that these groups had won their case without need for a trial.Judge Katz ordered the F.D.A. to alert drug manufacturers that it intended to prohibit the use of penicillin and tetracycline to promote growth in animals. The manufacturers can request a hearing to present evidence that these uses are safe. If the companies have such evidence, the drugs can continue to be used for growth promotion, the judge wrote.'"
"'12-03-24,'0','WASHINGTON (AP) — Sales of new homes fell in February for the second consecutive month.The Commerce Department said Friday that new-home sales dropped 1.6 percent last month, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 313,000 homes. Sales have fallen nearly 7 percent since December.While a mild winter and three months of strong job growth have lifted resales, those conditions have not helped the new-home market. The current pace is less than half the 700,000 that economists consider to be healthy.Economists cautioned that the housing market was a long way from fully recovering.“Despite renewed hopes over the turn of the year for an imminent turn in housing, it appears that it is too early for such optimism to translate into a rapid pickup in real activity,” said Yelena Shulyatyeva, an analyst at BNP Paribas.There were some positive signs in the report. The government revised December’s sales figures up to show an annual rate of 336,000, the best sales pace in a year.And the median sales price for new homes surged in February more than 8 percent, to $233,700. That is the highest median price since June.Just 150,000 new homes were for sale in the United States in January and February — the lowest number in records that date back to 1963. The supply of new homes on the market has consistently fallen over the last two years, which could help stabilize prices.'"

"'12-03-25,'0','HOUSTON — Both candidates seeking the Democratic nomination for the Congressional seat held for two decades by Tom DeLay, the former House majority leader, are unusual.One of them, K. P. George, has a background that makes him an improbable candidate — he was born in a village in India that still has no electricity or running water. For his opponent, Kesha Rogers, it is her political positions that stand out — she is best known for demanding President Obama’s impeachment.In light of Ms. Rogers’s candidacy, the Fort Bend County Democratic Party’s executive committee has issued a rare primary endorsement, backing Mr. George in the 22nd District.“If I can figure out what that silver bullet is to make sure that she is not on my slate after May, then I’ll definitely do that,” said Steve Brown, chairman of the Fort Bend Democratic Party. “I don’t think the endorsement alone is going to do it. It’s going to take work.”Party officials worry that if Ms. Rogers prevails, Democrats will not be able to encourage voters to cast straight-ticket ballots for their party in the general election — already an uphill battle in the Houston suburbs. But Ms. Rogers, a follower of the controversial activist Lyndon H. LaRouche Jr., says she is in the race “to restore the principles of Franklin Roosevelt and John F. Kennedy to the Democratic Party.”'"
"'12-03-25,'0','It is rare for a Knicks game to yield only good outcomes for the team, and Saturday’s good vibes were seemingly dashed when Amar’e Stoudemire left in the third quarter with a sore lower back. Stoudemire, whose back problems knocked him out of the playoffs last season and prevented him from playing in the off-season, had his playing status listed as questionable after he went back to the locker room.But Stoudemire and his teammates, including Tyson Chandler and Carmelo Anthony, played down the injury after the game.“It’s just got a little tight, that’s all,” Stoudemire said. “We just took precautionary measures. Just came in the back and got treatment.”Jeremy Lin also left the game with an injury in the third quarter. He had a sore left knee and returned to the bench. He was available but was not needed with the outcome in hand. Lin said his knee was “good to go,” and said the team was taking a precaution because of “overuse.”No Knick scored more than 17 points, but Stoudemire, Lin, Chandler, Anthony and J. R. Smith all finished in double figures. Anchoring a defense that held the Pistons to 37 percent shooting, Chandler tied a season high by snagging 17 rebounds.The Knicks overcame eight turnovers to build a 4-point advantage after the first quarter on the strength of good shooting and solid defense. The Pistons, their offense lacking without Stuckey, scored 10 of their 17 first-quarter points off those turnovers.Both teams flew to New York after losses Friday, and the sloppy play reflected that, with the ball bouncing off feet, fingers and faces. Sequences of back-to-back turnovers were common occurrences in the first half.“But I am concerned, from a basketball standpoint, the turnovers,” Woodson said. “It’s just ridiculous, I think. We’re just too nonchalant with the basketball and not reading it.”The Knicks said before the game that a magnetic resonance imaging test had confirmed inflammation in the right knee of Jared Jeffries, and that he would miss about two weeks.“It gives other guys an opportunity to step up, like Josh,” Woodson said, referring to the rookie Josh Harrellson. In 12 minutes on Saturday, Harrellson (4 points, 7 rebounds) fit in well, and the team played solid defense.A bigger test comes Monday against a lightning-quick Milwaukee Bucks backcourt that will demand pick-and-roll switches and constant harassment from the Knicks’ big men.The coaching matchup was intriguing because under different circumstances, Woodson and Lawrence Frank might have been on opposite benches. Frank was D’Antoni’s first choice to become the Knicks’ defensive coach last summer. When the Pistons hired Frank as their head coach, D’Antoni turned to Woodson, who had interviewed for the top coaching jobs in Detroit, Minnesota and Houston.“I struck out three times this summer,” Woodson said.Frank avoided the topic, saying, “I’m happy where I’m at.”The Knicks were forced to evaluate where they were after the game, as Woodson had pictures of the Larry O’Brien Trophy — given to the N.B.A. champion — taped above every player’s locker during the third quarter of Saturday night’s game.“I have no idea what the story is,” Stoudemire said. “But I’m a visual guy, so I love to see it. So whenever you got those type of trophy posters over your locker, it gives you that visual, that you can achieve that goal, so it’s great to see.”Stoudemire, whose improved play has spurred the Knicks during their recent surge, will have to remain healthy for those visual aids to have any significance.Ben Wallace (0 points and 7 rebounds in 19 minutes) played what was most likely his last game at the Garden. Wallace was the anchor and Mike Woodson the architect of the defense that propelled the Pistons to the 2004 N.B.A. championship. Wallace has said that he will retire after the season. ... J. R. Smith and Iman Shumpert connected on a spectacular give-and-go alley-oop late in the fourth quarter. Shumpert said it was the first time he had executed such a play in a game situation.'"

"'12-03-25,'0','If there is one lesson from the financial crisis that should be indelible, it is that unregulated are prone to catastrophic failure. And yet, nearly four years after the crash, and nearly two years since the passage of the Dodd-Frank law, the multitrillion-dollar derivatives market is still dominated by a handful of big , and regulation is a slow work in progress.That means Americans, and the economy, remain at risk. Properly regulated, derivatives — financial instruments that hedge risk — help to stabilize the economy. Unregulated, they are all too easily converted into tools for vast speculation, as demonstrated by their role in inflating the real estate bubble, amplifying the bust and provoking the bailouts. Unreformed, they will cause havoc again.Even if they don’t cause a meltdown, unregulated derivatives are still an economic threat. That’s because derivatives have become deeply embedded in the economy. Pension systems use them to hedge risk. Food companies use them to lock in crop prices. Airlines and manufacturers use them to lock in prices for fuel or metal. But because there is no central exchange where derivatives’ prices are listed, no one knows if the prices banks charge are reasonable.What is known is that the banks make billions of dollars a year on derivatives deals — lush profits that are surely higher than they would be if the market were transparent and competitive. Overcharging means that bankers are enriched with money that companies could otherwise invest in their businesses and that consumers could otherwise keep in their pockets.The Dodd-Frank law charged two agencies with writing a broad range of new rules to rein in derivatives — the , which oversees derivatives linked to oil, crops and other commodities, and the , which oversees securities-based derivatives. There has been progress. The C.F.T.C, in particular, has moved ahead with sound rules to create competition, promote safety, increase transparency and tame speculation. But some of the toughest rules are languishing — like the crucial Dodd-Frank requirement that most derivatives be traded on an open exchange, with prices visible before deals are made.That would minimize the practice of trading derivatives as private bilateral contracts, in which the price is whatever the bank says it is. Over a year ago, the C.F.T.C. sensibly proposed a system in which buy and sell offers would be electronically posted and widely accessible. In response, industry lobbyists and some lawmakers have made the absurd argument that open trading would hurt banks’ flexibility to continue doing business as usual.Unfortunately, in today’s political environment, even absurd arguments have the power to delay or derail vital reforms. Republican lawmakers, with some Democratic support, have proposed legislation to roll back the rules on open trading even before regulators have finalized them. Rules that have been finalized are increasingly subject to protracted legal challenges by the financial industry. And regulators are routinely reduced to pleading with Congressional appropriators for chump change to carry out their duties.'"
"'12-03-25,'0','“I don’t care,” he said. “What are they going to see?”But when Valentine called for a suicide squeeze in the ninth inning of Thursday night’s game against the Yankees, the Yankees had plenty to see. They may have been irritated that Valentine, against spring training protocol, used the play. He had runners on second and third and one out with the Yankees leading by a run, and flashed some of his National League pedigree by running the squeeze instead of letting the hitter swing away, and possibly win the game with a hit.Whether or not it was showmanship, it gave Yankees Manager Joe Girardi something to think about when these teams meet when it matters.“I don’t think they would do that with most of their hitters,” Girardi said, “but you have to be aware.”The Yankees would have also been remiss not to have noticed that the new Red Sox right-hander Aaron Cook, a career National Leaguer, has a solid pickoff move. Cook picked off two savvy Yankees runners, Eric Chavez and Andruw Jones. They are not likely to fall asleep on him again this season.“I think we saw how quick Cookie’s feet are,” Girardi said.Valentine, who said he wanted to see how his players executed the squeeze, also drew criticism from Lou Piniella, the former manager who is a YES Network broadcaster, for another play he ran in the first meeting between the Red Sox and the Yankees. In the bottom of the first, the Yankees had runners at second and third. Valentine had shortstop Mike Aviles and second baseman Dustin Pedroia start back, then charge on the pitch.Piniella said managers should never run plays like that in spring training, an assessment Valentine dismissed with a wave of his hand.“Really? he said. “So how are you supposed to know how it works if you don’t practice it? That was a perfect place for us to work on it.”But it is not only the new managers who have to be watched carefully. Yankees center fielder Curtis Granderson recalled a 2008 spring training game when he was with the Detroit Tigers, playing against the Toronto Blue Jays. Granderson noted how aggressive the Blue Jays were on the basepaths, speeding from bag to bag at every chance, and they did not care who saw it.“I figured, these guys are going to try and steal a lot of bases this year,” Granderson said.Sure enough, the Blue Jays, in the fifth and final year under Manager John Gibbons, stole 80 bases, a 40 percent increase from the year before.Chavez said that one spring training he noticed the unusual way the ball came off the bat of the left-handed first baseman Casey Kotchman.“Normally lefties have some slice on the ball when they hit it to third,” he said. “He didn’t. It just came with normal topspin, like a right-handed hitter pulling the ball.”So in the regular season Chavez made sure to play Kotchman closer to the line than he would for most left-handed hitters.Girardi said he could recall a sliver of information that he learned in spring training of 2008 from one at-bat by Evan Longoria, the Rays’ rookie third baseman.“It was the first time I saw him, and, man, it was a great at-bat,” Girardi said. “He fouled off some really good pitches and then hit a double to right-center. I said, ‘Wow.’ ”So, Longoria was good even then. It was the kind of springtime material even Maddon could not hide from the scouts.After doing extra work with the hitting coach Kevin Long and Reggie Jackson on Friday, Raul Ibanez, who has been terrible at the plate, responded with a home run off Max Scherzer in the Yankees 4-2 victory in 10 innings over the Tigers on Saturday. “It felt good to get to first base and take a left turn instead of a right turn,” Ibanez said. ... Francisco Cervelli was struck on the left shin with a pitch and removed from the game, but he said it was not serious. “Don’t write anything,” he said. “Nothing happened.” ... The Tigers tied the game, 2-2, in the bottom of the ninth, but this time, as opposed to Thursday in Fort Myers, the Yankees stuck around to play the 10th inning. ... The Yankees reassigned Dellin Betances to their Class AAA affiliate. ... Phil Hughes will throw in a minor league game Monday.'"
"'12-03-25,'0','Mr. Keil did research for the council’s Pompidou Group, which combats drug abuse and drug trafficking. He is considering a career in the State Department, so the experience was very useful, he said, “and my French improved greatly.”During the school year, Syracuse students who study abroad have the option of pursuing internships in addition to taking classes, but their tuition is the same regardless. Beyond tuition, program fees (including housing) range from $5,735 to $7,500, and substantial financial aid is available, said Suzanne Shane, program director at SU Abroad. In summer, students may pursue a full-time internship for credit without taking other courses. For this option, they pay about $1,000 a credit, as well as fees ranging from $2,000 to $3,840 when lodging is part of the package.In the United States, a debate has arisen over the fairness of unpaid internships. So the idea of not receiving a salary, and in fact paying thousands of dollars more while putting in almost three months of work abroad, may not sit well with some students. But others feel that paying to have internships arranged helps to ensure their quality.Joe Roma, director of programs for Intrax Internships Abroad, said: “We do a great deal of work seeking host companies that are going to provide value to the student.” Intrax is a for-profit global education company whose internship arm offers positions in Asia, Latin America and Europe.Intrax’s internship programs cost from around $5,600 to $7,900. That includes placement, visa help, housing, a global skills training course, cultural activities, insurance and individual support, he said. Airfare is extra, and very rarely are students paid. “Some companies offer a stipend; we don’t arrange that,” Mr. Roma said.Cheryl Miyake, a junior at Stanford majoring in sociology, got an internship in Beijing last summer through Intrax after meeting a company representative at a career fair. She interned for a local company that offers music and English immersion classes to children.“Not only did I get to travel and work on my Mandarin speaking skills, but I really got to understand what Chinese business culture is like,” she said, gaining a better sense of “guanxi,” a code of building relationships that is important to conducting business.She was relieved that Intrax handled setting up a work visa, which can be hard to obtain in China, and arranged housing in Western-style apartments.While in Beijing, she was part of a group of students that took training courses arranged by Intrax. Being able to meet others who, like her, were undergoing a certain amount of culture shock, was helpful, she said.OF course, students who are already abroad can look for positions on their own. But Ms. Berger advises students to tread carefully. Studying abroad is such a valuable, pleasurable and short-term experience that it could add more stress to work as well, she said. As an alternative, she suggests that students arrange 10 or so informational interviews with professionals while they take classes abroad.“People have internships on the brain” these days, she said, but it’s important to choose the right time and place for them.'"
"'12-03-25,'0','But Collins seemed incredulous when asked why he would not log such notes on a computer or just track the statistics online.“A computer?” Collins said. “Why would I want to use a computer?”Collins, 62, a baseball lifer, does not quite remember when he started taking these notes, only that it was a long time ago. With some thought, he surmised that it must have just been one of the many habits he absorbed in the early 1990s while coaching with the Pittsburgh Pirates and watching his mentor, Jim Leyland, go about his day.“I know I saw Leyland do it,” Collins said. “It’s probably just something I picked up from him, and I’ve kept doing it.”Collins’s personal bookkeeping has been particularly important to him this year.In Collins’s ideal world, each of his regular players would finish spring training with 50 to 60 at-bats. The numbers, Collins said, are not based on any exact science, only the instinct and wisdom he has gathered during his decades in the game.Collins said he understood the limitations of evaluating such simple figures. But he said he nevertheless liked to keep the numbers close by, a sort of heuristic way to track a player’s progress. “I believe there’s a certain level where I feel like these guys need to be to get them comfortable getting into the season,” Collins said of the numerical benchmarks. “We only have a certain amount of time to get them there.”But getting his players work, he knows too well, often falls out of his control. Collins has expressed frustration with a recent rash of injuries. Before the Mets’ game Saturday against the St. Louis Cardinals, Lucas Duda, who took off time with a sore back, had 24 at-bats. Andres Torres, who has been sitting out with a strained calf, had 23. Ruben Tejada, who hurt his groin, had 19.And David Wright, who tore an abdominal muscle before the team’s first game, has not had a single at-bat.“David’s not going to get as many as we’d like,” Collins said. “But we have ways to get him at-bats. He’ll be fine.”During spring training, at-bats can be gathered in a hurry in games at the minor league complex, where players can hit once every inning if they like.Jason Bay said that those at-bats, against minor league pitchers, might not be of the utmost quality, but that their rapid-fire volume allowed hitters to identify problem areas and experiment with adjustments fairly quickly.“I don’t personally have the experience to say I need 58 at-bats, or whatever it might be, to be ready for the spring,” Daniel Murphy said. “We sort of just trust T. C. with that stuff. And he keeps the lines of communication open, so I can also go to him and say, ‘Hey, I think I need to get into some games here.’ ”Murphy, who had 34 at-bats after playing Friday night, said he really paid attention only to the feel of his swing and his comfort level at the plate when trying to gauge his readiness for the season. Others expressed similar sentiments.Bay, who entered Saturday with 25 at-bats, said, “Ideally, you’re trying to get into sort of a middle area: enough to be comfortable, but not so many that you wear yourself out before April 5.”The Mets have less than two weeks to find that middle ground. And Collins, writing nightly on his yellow legal pad, will try to guide them there.The Mets and St. Louis tied, 6-6, at Digital Domain Park. Mike Pelfrey, who has struggled this spring, tried out a new windup. He gave up five runs and eight hits in six innings, lowering his Grapefruit League earned run average to 11.49. “I thought he was much, much better,” Terry Collins said. “His ball had great life to it. I think he moved forward a long way.”'"
"'12-03-25,'0','As of last September, only 2.5 percent of Fannie and Freddie mortgages were seriously delinquent, versus 7.2 percent for banks’ mortgages.Still, the crowd clamors for widespread Fannie and Freddie write-downs, even though they would constitute a direct and sizable gift from taxpayers to the largest banks.Here’s how: Many banks hold second liens on the same properties for which Fannie and Freddie either own the first mortgage or have guaranteed. If principal amounts on these first mortgages are reduced while leaving the second liens intact, those seconds become much more likely to be paid off over time. With no principal reduction, the banks would have to write off many of those second liens.As such, principal write-downs are another backdoor bailout for the banks that brought you the mortgage crisis.Answering his critics, Mr. DeMarco has agreed to approve principal reductions at Fannie and Freddie, but only when Congress passes legislation enabling it. Writing a law to force taxpayers to bail out the banks in this way, however, might anger constituents. So it’s far easier for members of Congress to rail against the one supposedly intransigent man who is preventing the great American housing recovery.As the election approaches, of course, the cries are bound to become even more strident.In a not-so-funny way, these attacks on Mr. DeMarco are depressingly familiar. Recall happier days when Fannie and Freddie were thriving. Members of their fan club routinely criticized regulators at the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight who tried to rein in the companies. Those attacks neutralized the regulator and a few lonely critics and are one of the reasons taxpayers are financing $183 billion in losses at the companies today.The companies themselves have studied principal write-downs and the effects they would have on taxpayers. But they are inconclusive, according to people who have been briefed on them.While some of the same people who helped get us into this housing mess call for Mr. DeMarco’s head, it’s instructive to see what Fannie and Freddie have done to help troubled homeowners — and to compare, where you can, the companies’ efforts with those of banks.In the quarter ended last September, Fannie and Freddie were responsible for 36.3 percent of all loan modifications, compared with 19.2 percent by banks. Of the 54,000 loan modifications initiated under the Treasury Department’s HAMP program in the September quarter, 44 percent were on Fannie and Freddie mortgages; bank-held loans accounted for a little more than half that share, at 23.6 percent.The September quarter is by no means an anomaly. Fannie and Freddie have consistently led in loan modifications since the beginning of 2010.Since the companies were taken over by taxpayers in September 2008, they have provided 1.1 million permanent loan modifications for homeowners. This compares with 950,000 permanent loan modifications under the HAMP program done by banks in a slightly shorter period — April 2009 to January 2012. These include modifications on loans held by investors, however.There’s more. According to a recent report from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, loan modifications by Fannie and Freddie have performed far better than those on privately held mortgages. Since the taxpayers took over the companies, re-default rates have been consistently lower at Fannie and Freddie than among privately held mortgages, the report shows.This suggests that the types of loan modifications provided by Fannie and Freddie — reducing borrowers’ monthly payments — are working fairly well. Addressing borrowers’ ability to repay loans has been the focus, Mr. DeMarco said. At the same time, these changes in loan terms do not encourage people to default in spite of being able to pay.“What we’re doing with the bulk of underwater borrowers is offering loan mods for principal forbearance, taking a good chunk of underwater principal and setting it aside at a zero rate of interest,” Mr. DeMarco said in an interview. “We’re getting the borrower into a mortgage they have an ability to repay.”Moreover, most of the borrowers who owe more on their Fannie and Freddie loans than their homes are worth continue to pay their mortgages. The most recent statistics from the companies show that nearly 80 percent of underwater borrowers were current as of June 30 last year. Among those borrowers defined as deeply underwater — their loan-to-value ratios are currently above 115 percent — 74 percent were current.Throughout the crisis and its aftermath, banks have been very good at ensuring that others — whether taxpayers, Fannie and Freddie, or private investors who hold loans in mortgage securities — do more to help troubled borrowers than banks have been willing to do themselves. This refusal to share the sacrifice is a major flaw in the recent foreclosure-abuses settlement that regulators have crowed about.Last week, The American Banker reported that mortgage securities investors might sue to stop the settlement because these investors object to paying for loan modifications that the banks will receive monetary credit for making.So the next time you hear someone advocating vast principal reductions on Fannie and Freddie loans, remind them that it would be another stealth bank bailout, courtesy of taxpayers. Banks’ unwillingness to share the pain has been a central feature of this crisis. It’s time to put an end to this dysfunctional dynamic.'"

He was 65 and lived in Washington.The cause had not yet been determined, said Lee Daniels, a spokesman for the fund.Named president in 2008, Mr. Payton was the defense fund’s sixth leader since it became a separate entity from the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People in 1940. He had been active in the civil rights movement since his days at Pomona College in the 1960s.In 2010, he was the lead attorney for the plaintiffs in Lewis v. City of Chicago, in which a group of African-Americans seeking to be firefighters contended that they had properly filed a charge of discrimination against the city.Mr. Payton argued that the cutoff score on a written examination to define the pool of qualified applicants had a disparate impact on minorities — a contention to which the city conceded. But the city had successfully argued in lower courts that the discrimination charge was filed after a statute of limitations had passed. The Supreme Court unanimously reversed the lower court ruling.A year earlier, in Northwest Austin Municipal Utility District No. 1 v. Holder, a municipal district in Austin, Tex., challenged the validity of Section 5, a core provision of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. The so-called pre-clearance clause requires government entities previously judged to have a history of discrimination to receive permission from the Justice Department before making substantive changes to the voting process in their districts. Mr. Payton assisted in the arguments leading to the Supreme Court’s 8-to-1 decision upholding Section 5.'"
"'12-03-25,'0','There are two ways to approach “Travesties.” You can put your brain on red alert, sit up straight and listen intently to all of Tom Stoppard’s clever wordplay, spoken by and about Lenin, James Joyce, a Dadaist poet named Tzara and a few lesser-known figures. Or you can relax, sit back and allow the play to wash over you, appreciating the verbal gems that come through clearly and letting the others pass. I did a bit of both on the opening night of the McCarter Theater Center’s beautifully done (but still highly challenging) new production.The Tony Award-winning “Travesties,” which was first produced in London in 1974 and came to Broadway the next year, is not an easy play. There are references to La Rochefoucauld, Zimmerwaldism and the Appassionata, and two characters, Gwendolen (Susannah Flood) and Cecily (Sara Topham), must have wandered in from “The Importance of Being Earnest.” But then “The Importance of Being Earnest” itself keeps wandering into “Travesties.”Like “Earnest,” “Travesties” involves mistaken identities, imaginary brothers and a woman who is remarkably picky about the given name of the man she will marry. Our onstage narrator, Henry Carr (James Urbaniak), is asked to play the role of Algernon Moncrieff in a local production of “Earnest.” In Act II, a character announces: “To lose one revolution is unfortunate. To lose two would look like carelessness.” (For those who don’t know every word Oscar Wilde ever wrote or spoke, this is a variation on a comic line in “Earnest” about losing one’s parents.)The year is 1917. We are in Zurich, where Carr is a British consular official who has encounters with Vladimir Lenin (Demosthenes Chrysan), the man who led the Bolsheviks in the October 1917 Russian Revolution; James Joyce (Fred Arsenault), the Irish author of “Ulysses” and other masterworks; and Tristan Tzara (Christian Coulson), a founder of the anti-establishment Dada art movement. At least that’s the way Carr remembers it in flashback almost 60 years later.Carr has a butler, played with exceptional style by Everett Quinton. This is not a butler who simply serves tea and disappears. He is quite vocal in his scenes, though at one point in Act II he got a hearty laugh just by bobbing his head as he exited.'"
"'12-03-25,'0','AS if the dispatcher had just barked out a “10-13” — the New York police radio code for an officer needing assistance — Capt. Anthony J. Raganella put the cruiser in gear and floored the accelerator. Seconds later, he was cornering hard. The tires were squealing.But he did not turn on the siren, as he would have if he had been rushing to a real crime scene. Captain Raganella, the commanding officer of the department’s Disorder Control Unit, was test-driving a new Ford Police Interceptor in a parking lot.Of course, the parking lot, at Citi Field in Flushing, Queens, had been marked off with a closed-loop course that was supposed to simulate the maneuvers an officer would make to cover 20 to 30 blocks with life-or-death urgency. After a couple of laps, Captain Raganella was enthusiastic about the Police Interceptor, which Ford designed to take the place of a 20-year stalwart, the discontinued Crown Victoria.“This is wonderful,” said Captain Raganella, who stressed that he was not speaking in an official capacity. “I felt at home in the Crown Vic. I felt more at home in this. Going around turns, this gives you more confidence. A lot more. It feels locked down to the ground.”Ford says it is replacing the police version of the Crown Victoria with five models — two sedans based on the Taurus and three sport utility vehicles based on the Explorer. Officers accustomed to the Crown Victoria might be concerned about two things the new models do not have: rear drive and V-8 engines. The new models have standard all-wheel drive, an option on civilian Tauruses, and a choice of three V-6s, all more powerful — and more fuel-efficient — than the previous V-8s.Ford’s goal was a 20 percent improvement in fuel economy. Citing the example of the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department, whose 6,200 vehicles rolled up 27 million miles last year, Ford said the new cars would save at least $20 million a year on gasoline, based on the current pump price.'"

"'12-03-25,'0','Mrs. Rousseau, who is in charge of sales and marketing for Flûte, was able to work from home, but Mr. Rousseau commuted by train to the city. He usually spent half the week in his old studio apartment, a rental in the theater district. (Mrs. Rousseau calls it a bachelor pad; he calls it a pied-à-terre.)Last year, Mr. Rousseau began a campaign to return to the city. “Hervé is the impulsive, let’s-do-it person, and I am the let’s-form-a-committee person,” Mrs. Rousseau said.Although she would have preferred to wait until they had studied the real estate situation in depth, she agreed to start the hunt. Their budget was in the $700,000s. Online searches led them to Harlem.They had decided to keep the Putnam County house for use in good weather, and Harlem allowed easy highway access. The couple were also drawn to the strong Senegalese community in Central Harlem, where little Felix could easily practice his French.Mrs. Rousseau was impressed with St. Nicholas Avenue, where they looked at the 10-year-old Rosa Parks Condominium. “We saw this broad, gracious avenue,” she recalled, “and there were kids walking in and out with their bikes.” The views, however, were disappointing, as many of the windows in the building faced an interior courtyard rather than the grand thoroughfare.They looked at a four-bedroom at the Normandie, a handsome restored seven-story building on West 119th Street. Some of the four-bedrooms were in the $700,000-to-$900,000 range. “You could have a family of five living comfortably there,” Mrs. Rousseau said, “and that is really unusual for New York at that kind of price point.”But they realized that layout was more important to them than the number of bedrooms. “Anybody can make 10 bedrooms in the apartment,” Mr. Rousseau said. “You take Sheetrock and put it up and you have a bedroom.”They found brand-new 88 Morningside beautiful inside, but the only affordable apartment of the right size that remained — a three-bedroom listed at $775,000 — was on the second floor, overlooking Morningside Park. Mrs. Rousseau felt the park was too close for comfort.“If we were in Paris looking into some leafy little green square or garden,” she said, “that would be charming.” But she feared throngs of schoolchildren directly outside.Both instantly liked the Apex Condominiums on Frederick Douglass Boulevard, a 2010 building that houses the Aloft Hotel on the lower floors. The living room in the model apartment was bright with northern and western sun. “Hervé brought his usually high level of enthusiasm and was, like, ‘Hand me a contract, I will sign it now,’ ” Mrs. Rousseau said. In this case, she agreed.The building offers four different two-bedroom layouts, said Khadeejah Johnson, the sales manager. Other layouts had larger living areas, but the Rousseaus liked one with the master bedroom in a separate wing, a long windowed corridor facing east, and an open kitchen, allowing for plenty of “central family space,” Mrs. Rousseau said.For 1,200 square feet, the Rousseaus paid $716,500, which also covered a parking space and a basement storage unit. Monthly charges are just under $1,000.The Rousseaus and Copper arrived late last summer. They are enjoying the neighborhood, which seems much less crowded and frenetic than Midtown or the Upper West Side, where Mrs. Rousseau grew up. Even so, she finds it difficult to get around town with a toddler. “I see children in strollers until they are 5 or 7 years old,” she said, “and can sympathize with parents who keep their kids in strollers for a long time.”Only after the family arrived did Mr. Rousseau realize how relieved he was to have a brief commute. Living full time in the city “has changed my routine because I can be with my family much more,” he said.Just after the move, he overestimated his travel time to Midtown. Meeting a friend near Columbus Circle, he was convinced he would be late. But he arrived early: The D-train trip, door-to-door, took 14 minutes.Mrs. Rousseau was surprised by the ease of the purchase. “We really did things by the seat of our pants and lucked out,” she said. Had she done extensive research, “this is where we would have ended up.”Among the few downsides is a Mister Softee truck that parks nearby. Its “very loud and very strident” jingle plays for hours, Mr. Rousseau said. “The windows are really efficient and block noise. I can’t hear a thing except that guy.”They refuse to get Felix ice cream from the truck. Instead, he speaks French at the Senegalese bakery, Patisserie des Ambassades, choosing between “un croissant” and “un pain au chocolat.”'"
"'12-03-25,'0','Under one plan, a 300-room hotel would be on the lower floors, and above would be 700 apartments, whose residents could avail themselves of the hotel’s services and staff, said Nathan Berman, a Metro Loft principal. Under a different plan, the skyscraper would be exclusively a residence, with about 970 apartments, he said.Either way, the smallest apartments would be 400-square-foot studios, the largest 1,800-square-foot four-bedrooms, in a nod to families moving to the Wall Street area.That area can still feel like a ghost town on weekends, when financial workers have cleared out. But a pioneering spirit will help draw new residents to the neighborhood, said Mr. Berman, as he gazed down at its streets from the light-filled observatory on 70 Pine’s top floor.“This is not where your grandmother used to live,” said Mr. Berman, who emigrated from the Soviet Union as a teenager and sold contemporary art before starting his real estate business in 1995. “This is not where people take over their parents’ apartments, and so on. It’s very new and very interesting.” Developers say the observatory will be either a common space or part of a 6,000-square-foot triplex. Also visible from there is New York by Gehry, the luxury rental at 8 Spruce Street that Mr. Berman considers his chief competition.But the ceilings at 70 Pine, at 12 feet high, will eclipse those in the Gehry building, Mr. Berman said, and prices appear competitive. Typical studios at New York by Gehry rent for about $2,700 a month, according to Citi Habitats, which handles its rentals; 70 Pine’s will average $2,400, Mr. Berman said.And once it opens, 70 Pine, at 950 feet, will become New York’s tallest residential building, which means it will bump New York by Gehry, at 876 feet, from the top spot. (But those bragging rights will very likely be short-lived. One57, the new condo-hotel to open on West 57th Street in the fall of 2013, will clock in at 1,004 feet.)The recent history of 70 Pine is somewhat stormy. Built as the headquarters of Cities Service, the oil company that later became Citgo, the building was bought by AIG in 1976. Severe losses brought on by the recent economic crisis led AIG to accept a $183 billion bailout from the federal government, which later demanded that the company sell real estate to help pay off its debt.In 2009, Kumho Investment Bank, in a partnership with the developer Youngwoo & Associates, bought both 70 Pine and 72 Wall Street, across the street, for $150 million, with a plan to convert 70 Pine to condominiums.Kumho and Youngwoo later parted ways in the midst of a sluggish sales market. Youngwoo then sued its former partner on charges of having pushed it out.After the split, Kumho hired Sciame Development to advise on whether office space, condos or hotels constituted the best use for 70 Pine, but it then changed course again, selling 70 Pine to Metro Loft and Eastbridge in a deal that closed in December. Sciame has sued Kumho for $7.7 million, claiming breach of contract, an accusation that Kumho denies. The case is ongoing.The legal issues may obscure the larger point that developers are continuing to bet big on the financial district, said Clifford Finn, the president for new development of Citi Habitats. “It’s now a first-choice destination for people,” he said. “It may not have started out like that, but it ended up that way.”'"

"'12-03-26,'1','When asked whether Goldman had borrowed the shares, Michael DuVally, a Goldman spokesman, said: “Mr. Cohodes is wrong. We met our obligations under applicable law.” He added that Copper River’s problems were the result of the extreme stress in the financial markets at the time.Goldman has sought to seal the transcript of Mr. Cohodes’s deposition, which is part of a case brought by Overstock.com, an Internet retailer, against two of the biggest Wall Street firms. Overstock contends that the firms — Goldman Sachs and Merrill Lynch — failed to borrow company shares that they or their clients sold short, a practice known as naked shorting. Overstock says that the firms essentially evaded rules intended to prevent stock manipulations, and that its stock came under outsize selling pressure as a result.Both of the firms sued by Overstock have denied the company’s accusations. They have requested that the judge overseeing the case seal all the documents generated in the discovery process, contending that their release would disclose trade secrets about the business, known as securities lending, which is highly profitable for the firms. The Times has joined three other media companies in asking the court to unseal the documents. Mr. Cohodes’s deposition, however, is not subject to the seal.Earlier this month, John E. Munter, the judge overseeing the case in California state court, ruled that many of the documents should be made public. The firms are expected to appeal the ruling.Mr. Cohodes declined to comment beyond his deposition or to explain why he had not sued Goldman over his fund’s losses. He has left the money management business and now raises chickens on his farm in Northern California. As an investor who often bet against companies, he drew the ire of many of his targets’ executives and shareholders. That he is a straight-talking man who enjoys the combat comes through in his testimony.Mr. Cohodes is not a party in the Overstock lawsuit and has had a longstanding adversarial relationship with the company, whose stock he bet against. When asked in the deposition if he wanted to help Overstock, he replied, “Oh, absolutely not.”Goldman’s handling of its clients has been a hot topic since the credit bubble burst. The firm’s creation of Abacus, a mortgage security that was meant to fail but was sold to the firm’s clients without disclosing that fact, was the subject of a $550 million regulatory settlement and Congressional hearings.More recently, a Goldman executive named Greg Smith resigned from the firm and wrote a scathing Op-Ed article in The Times. Mr. Smith contended in his open letter to the firm’s top management that its culture had become toxic and that it had placed its own interests ahead of its customers’. Goldman denied the claims and contended that its customers came first.Mr. Cohodes’s testimony in the Overstock case provides new details of his fund’s surprising demise in the market rout. At the time Copper River closed, he only alluded to his problems with Goldman. In an early October 2008 letter to investors describing the September turmoil, he said that “counterparties did not provide the level of business support that they have in the past,” something that exacerbated losses.While few investors understand or care about the mechanics of securities lending, the area has come under increased regulatory scrutiny. The Securities and Exchange Commission has brought several cases in recent years accusing market participants of failing to borrow shares they or their customers had sold short, improperly creating a supply of additional stock to sell.Along with a handful of traders at smallish firms, Goldman’s securities lending unit has been cited by regulators for lapses. In 2010, the S.E.C. sued Goldman on accusations that it “willfully” had failed to preborrow shares as required for its short-selling clients in January 2009, shortly after Copper River went out of business. The improprieties involved 385 short sales in which the firm had not located shares for its brokerage clients to borrow.Goldman paid $450,000 to settle the case without admitting or denying the accusations.Failing to borrow shares on behalf of customers is illegal because of concerns about market manipulation. But it can also leave a brokerage firm’s client who is short a stock dangerously exposed to an escalating price in the shares. If a stock shorted by an investor began to trade higher and the shares were not borrowed, closing out the transaction would require the fund to buy them in the open market. That could propel the already rising price of the shares even higher, adding to the costs of the trade.Mr. Cohodes, who worked at the hedge fund for 25 years, testified in the Overstock case because his firm had placed short bets on that Internet company’s shares during the mid-2000s. In 2005 Overstock sued Copper River for stock manipulation, seeking $1 billion in damages. Copper River denied the accusations but settled the matter in late 2009, paying $5 million.In his Overstock testimony, Mr. Cohodes described Goldman’s role as the primary brokerage firm used by Copper River from 2004 through October 2008. Goldman conducted many of Copper River’s trades and was relied upon to locate all the shares the firm needed to borrow before it bet against companies.According to Mr. Cohodes’s deposition, Copper River often sold short shares that were hard to locate for borrowing purposes and therefore extremely costly. As such, Copper River paid Goldman handsomely to make sure its trades complied with securities laws, Mr. Cohodes testified. He was unhappy about these fees, he said, but assumed that they were the cost of doing business and that Goldman was charging the market rate for following the rules.“I view stock loan sort of as the Mafia,” Mr. Cohodes said in his deposition. “It’s a black box where you don’t know people’s inputs and costs, and it was sort of: ‘Here’s the rate. If you want to borrow it, this is the rate.’ And it is what it is.”As an investor, Mr. Cohodes had long expected a stock market correction to result when the overheated mortgage market finally cooled. By mid-2008 he had put on sizable bets against companies that he thought would suffer in such a rout, he testified. One was American Capital, an investment company; others were the Open Text Corporation, a company that offers intranet applications, and Jos. A. Bank, a men’s clothing store.When Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac collapsed in early September 2008 and the stock market began to fall, Mr. Cohodes thought that his firm was well positioned to profit from the downturn, he recalled. His troubles began after Lehman Brothers failed; Copper River’s funds at the firm were suddenly frozen. Then government regulators changed the rules governing short-selling, banning the practice altogether in shares of roughly 800 financial companies and decreasing the amount of time allowed for such trades to settle.This caused a violent rally in these shares. But the stocks that made up Copper River’s largest short positions were not on the short ban list.Nevertheless, the stocks climbed, and Goldman began requiring Copper River to unwind its short positions by buying back the shares. This upset Mr. Cohodes, he said, because the firm’s account was in compliance with its federal regulatory margin requirement. Moreover, the fund was not leveraged; it had not made its bets using borrowed money.Instead, he said, he suspected that Goldman had never borrowed the shares for Copper River’s short positions and was trying to close out the trades to eliminate the problematic naked short positions. Because Goldman had a duty to borrow the shares, it could have risked regulatory questions about compliance, under Mr. Cohodes’s account.Mr. DuVally rejected this argument. “Significant losses and a drop in position value caused the Copper River accounts to incur risk calls in September 2008, which it did not adequately address,” he said. “As a result, we declared an event of default, which entitled us as prime broker to require liquidation of the account.”Desperate to save his firm, Mr. Cohodes said he began working to transfer his account to another bank, BNP Paribas. Goldman refused to release Copper River’s positions, he said.When he discussed having another fund, Farallon Capital, take over Copper River’s short positions, Goldman thwarted that transfer as well, Mr. Cohodes testified. Farallon’s chief financial officer had told Copper River that an unnamed trader on Goldman’s proprietary desk had warned him not to take the hedge fund’s positions because it would “be out of business in a couple of days anyway,” the deposition said.Greg Swart, the chief financial officer at Farallon, declined to comment.As the stocks continued climbing, Mr. Cohodes came to believe that Goldman was buying the stocks that he was short ahead of him, driving up their prices and making Copper River’s short-covering purchases even more costly, he testified.Mr. Cohodes continued: “The stock market was literally falling apart, going straight down. And our short positions would have benefited hugely by the market falling apart and melting down. But the stocks that we had to cover were all going straight up in violent fashions in a straight-down market.” Someone, he said, was driving up his price.Mr. DuVally of Goldman said in response, “We looked into these front-running allegations, and they are not true.” He added, “We conducted the liquidation in a manner designed to limit, to the extent possible in an extremely volatile market, losses in Copper River’s accounts.” He declined to say why Goldman did not allow Copper River’s accounts to be transferred.It is possible, of course, that other investors knew of Copper River’s short trades, figured that the fund was in distress and rushed to buy the stocks the fund was covering. But the warning call to Farallon from Goldman’s proprietary desk indicated to Mr. Cohodes that the Wall Street firm was front-running Copper River, he said.As soon as Copper River’s short trades were closed out, the stocks it had focused on began plummeting, charts show. Most of the stocks peaked on Sept. 23 and started falling precipitously.“I think Goldman Sachs is a racketeering entity that does whatever they can to make a dime without conscience, thought, foresight or care about ramifications,” Mr. Cohodes concluded in his testimony. “I think they are cold-blooded and could care less about the law. That’s my opinion. I think I can back it up.”Goldman said Mr. Cohodes had been a satisfied Goldman customer who changed his view only after his fund experienced losses.Copper River closed at the end of September 2008. The stocks it had been short soon collapsed.'"

"'12-03-26,'1','Microsoft’s involvement in what had been considered largely a law enforcement function — fighting computer crime — is the brainchild of Richard Boscovich, a former federal prosecutor who is a senior lawyer in Microsoft’s digital crimes unit. That group watches over fraud that could affect the company’s products and reputation.Mr. Boscovich, who handled drug, computer and financial crime cases in Miami in his former job, devised a novel legal strategy to underpin the growing number of Microsoft’s civil suits against bot-herders. Among other things, he argued that the culprits behind botnets were violating Microsoft’s trademarks through fake e-mails they used to spread their malicious software.Mr. Boscovich said the Friday sweep was meant to send a message to the criminals behind the scheme, whose identities are unknown. “We’re letting them know we’re looking at them,” said Mr. Boscovich after participating in the Pennsylvania raid, in Scranton.Before Friday’s sweep, Microsoft attacked three botnets in the last couple of years through civil suits. In each case, Microsoft obtained court orders that permitted it to seize Web addresses and computers associated with the botnets without first notifying the owners of the property. The secrecy was necessary, Microsoft argued, to prevent criminals from re-establishing new communications links to their infected computers.Some security experts said Microsoft’s tactics had been effective, even if they had not eradicated the scourge of botnets.“Taking the disruption into the courthouse was a brilliant idea and is helping the rest of the industry to reconsider what actions are possible, and that action is needed and can succeed,” said Richard Perlotto, director at the Shadowserver Foundation, a nonprofit group that tracks data about tools used for online fraud and forms of computer crime.Mr. Perlotto and Microsoft said they did not see civil legal action against people who commit online crime as a replacement for law enforcement action, which can result in much stiffer criminal penalties. “We equate this to a neighborhood watch,” Mr. Boscovich said.Jose Nazario, a senior security researcher at Arbor Networks, an Internet security firm, said that Microsoft’s record against botnets had been a “mixed bag” and that some of its gains were only temporary. After an earlier action against a botnet known as Waledac, for example, the software behind it was modified slightly to create a new botnet.“You can take out a botnet, but unless you take down the coders and put the clients behind bars, they’re just going to go ahead and do this again,” Mr. Nazario said.The computers that make up a botnet are usually conscripted without the knowledge of their owners, who unwittingly infect their machines after clicking on links in legitimate-looking e-mails for things like security updates from Microsoft and notices of tax refunds from the Internal Revenue Service. Clicking those links takes users to Web sites that exploit security holes in their browsers or other programs on their computers.Criminals use the holes to install malicious programs that siphon personal information from the infected computers, like online bank account passwords and credit card numbers. They can also harness the infected machines to send millions of e-mail messages to other users on the Internet, including scam messages that help propagate the botnet. Sometimes botnets are rented to clients to send spam messages advertising products like counterfeit pharmaceuticals.On Friday, Microsoft was attacking its most complex target yet, known as the Zeus botnets. The creators of Zeus offer their botnet code for sale to others and, depending on the level of customer support and customization of the code that clients require, charge them $700 to $15,000 for the software, Microsoft said in a lawsuit filed in federal court in Brooklyn on March 19.That, in turn, has resulted in many variants of Zeus botnets, making them harder to combat. Most of them are aimed at perpetrating various financial scams against online victims. Mr. Boscovich of Microsoft said he had a “high degree of confidence” that the unnamed culprits behind Zeus were in Eastern Europe.To carry out the scams, they have hired people known as money mules to travel to different countries, including the United States, to set up bank accounts so they can receive transfers of stolen money from victims’ accounts, Microsoft said in its complaint. Microsoft said that the Zeus botnets had enabled the theft of more than $100 million from victims since 2007 and that 13 million computers were infected with some form of software associated with it.Because of the financial fraud involved, Microsoft rallied support from two financial industry associations — the Financial Services Information Sharing and Analysis Center and the National Automated Clearing House Association — which were were co-plaintiffs in the case and filed court declarations endorsing Microsoft’s sweep on Friday.Microsoft does not believe the operators of the facilities it raided on Friday, which rent space to clients on computers connected to the Internet, are in league with the people behind the botnets. And those operators said they had no idea that equipment inside their facilities was being used to issue commands to Zeus.“It’s very difficult, unless they draw attention to themselves, to pick up on it,” said Joe Marr, chief technology officer of BurstNet Technologies, the facility in Scranton that Microsoft entered Friday.Mr. Boscovich said he did not think the Friday sweep would be as big a blow to Zeus as Microsoft’s previous actions against botnets, but he said it was just the beginning of actions aimed at raising the cost of doing business for the botnet’s masterminds. “The plan is to disrupt, disrupt, disrupt,” he said.'"
"'12-03-26,'1','The get-tough-on-crime and mandatory sentencing policies that swept America beginning in the 1970s did more than drive up the inmate population and prison costs. They also ensured that inmates who once might have been seen as rehabilitated and given parole would grow old and even die behind bars. As a result, prisons are struggling to furnish costly, specialized care to ever more inmates who suffer from age-related infirmities, especially dementia.According to a report from Human Rights Watch, in 2010 roughly 125,000 of the nation’s 1.5 million inmates were 55 years of age and over. This represented a 282 percent increase between 1995 and 2010, compared with a 42 percent increase in the overall inmate population. If the elderly inmate population keeps growing at the current rate, as is likely, the prison system could soon find itself overwhelmed with chronic medical needs.There is no official count of how many inmates suffer from dementia. But some gerontologists say the current caseload represents the trickle before the deluge. They say the risk of the disease is higher behind bars because inmates are sicker to start with — with higher rates of depression, diabetes, hypertension, H.I.V./AIDS and head trauma. Given these risk factors, the dementia rate in prison could well grow at two or three times that of the world outside.This is a daunting prospect for prison officials whose difficulties in keeping pace with the present dementia caseload were underscored in a recent report by The Times’s Pam Belluck. The article portrayed officials in crowded, understaffed correctional facilities scrambling to care for ailing inmates who can no longer feed, dress or clean themselves and who create conflict and disorder because they can no longer follow simple commands.The Human Rights Watch study said the cost of providing medical care to elderly inmates is between three and nine times the cost for younger ones. Another study found that the annual average health care cost per prisoner is about $5,500; about $11,000 for inmates aged 55 to 59 and $40,000 for inmates 80 or older. A specialized unit for cognitively impaired inmates in the New York State system costs more than $90,000 per bed per year, more than twice the figure for general inmates.Many inmates, obviously, can never be released, and they will continue to require special care. But the states must pursue other avenues as well. They can foster partnerships between prisons and nursing homes to improve the quality of care; consider compassionate release programs for frail inmates who no longer present a threat to public safety; and, no less important, revisit the mandatory sentencing policies that did away with judicial discretion and filled the prisons to bursting in the first place.'"
"'12-03-26,'1','When Maggie Vail first heard about open-source software, she said, “it felt like punk rock.”Ms. Vail, a longtime member of the independent rock music scene, is one of the executive directors of CASH Music, a nonprofit group that wants to bring some of punk’s do-it-yourself spirit to an area that many musicians find frustratingly complex and expensive: managing their music and fan interactions online.CASH, which stands for Coalition of Artists and Stakeholders, is part of a growing market of behind-the-scenes companies like Topspin Media and Bandcamp that handle the kind of business tasks that used to be the domain of record labels — marketing, merchandising and Web distribution among them. But unlike most of those companies, which take fees on transactions, CASH offers its services free and uses open-source software that can be customized by anyone. In that way, it is a kind of Linux for musicians.CASH was founded by two performers, Kristin Hersh and Donita Sparks, as a way to release their music, and has grown into a portfolio of Web tools for artists and labels. It offers ways to stream music securely and control access to files online, as well as widgets to sell music, collect e-mail addresses and do various forms of marketing.If that sounds like a threat to the profit-making players in the “direct to fan” market, as it is known, it is not an accident.The open promise of the Internet, CASH says on its Web site, “has quickly become another avenue controlled by various middlemen and gatekeepers looking for their percentage or to build another business on the backs of creators without proper or fair compensation.”'"

"'12-03-26,'1','Despite Paul Krugman’s portrayal, natural gas producers are aggressively regulated by both state and federal authorities. It is proved every day that you don’t have to sacrifice environmental protection to have domestic energy, jobs and economic development.Natural gas producers are also major job creators. More than 600,000 jobs exist today thanks to American shale gas production. That number is expected to grow to 1.6 million by 2035. Because of the abundance of natural gas, major manufacturing companies are building new facilities here in the United States instead of overseas.Because natural gas is a clean, abundant American resource, we see our nation’s power generators using more of it, often partnering with renewable sources, cleaning the air over our cities and towns. City buses, waste trucks, and utility and delivery trucks are switching to natural gas, eliminating emissions and saving money on fuel.Our own resource, American natural gas, is and should be a growing choice when making economic, environmental and clean energy decisions.'"
"'12-03-26,'1','Fiona Apple has control. That’s clear from the moment she took the stage on Friday night at the Music Hall of Williamsburg in Brooklyn. She opened with some patter about missing her dog (of whom she had a painting), an insistence that people in the crowd not talk during the show and then announced, “I will give you everything I can possibly give you,” before opening her first New York concert in five years with a staggeringly loud, brightly alive “Fast as You Can,” spitting out her syllables in carefully measured cadences, her body shivering with vigor.Vibrating hot and fast was the order of the night, the release of long pent-up energy. Ms. Apple’s fourth album, “The Idler Wheel is wiser than the Driver of the Screw, and Whipping Cords will serve you more than Ropes will ever do,” (Epic) is scheduled for a June release, about 16 years after her debut. In recent weeks she’s unveiled some of the new material during a small tour.During this show Ms. Apple moved between the microphone at center stage and a piano off to the side with an array of votive candles on top. Slender and toned, she wore a green tank top; her muscles spoke loudly as her body moved in precise ways on each song. On “Paper Bag” she held her hand tight against her stomach, muscles flexing, as she swayed side to side ever so slightly. During “Sleep to Dream” she stretched up against the piano like a cat, yawning with her frame.These were careful maneuvers that played as a contrast to Ms. Apple’s voice, which can be raspy and slithery and unhinged when she so chooses. Her band — Blake Mills on guitar, Sebastian Steinberg on bass and Amy Wood on drums — matched that range, creating a vivid and flexible noise that veered from gnarled rock to dirty blues. Mr. Mills, in particular, was intense, coaxing lust and anguish from his instrument.Ms. Apple played three songs from the forthcoming album: “Anything We Want,” “Valentine” and “Every Single Night.” On all three Mr. Steinberg played upright bass (for much of the rest of the show he played an electric bass), creating a more subdued mood. It hardly mattered that as a piece they were slightly more tentative than her older material.'"

"'12-03-27,'0','After months of delay, the Obama administration is about to unveil the first federal standards to explicitly limit greenhouse-gas emissions from new electric power plants — one of the chief sources of carbon dioxide emissions linked to climate change.According to people briefed by the Environmental Protection Agency, all existing plants — including the 300 or so coal-fired power plants that now release the highest level of these emissions and yet-to-be-built plants that have already received E.P.A. permits — will be grandfathered in at current levels, meaning they are exempt from the new proposed rule.Under the new rule, expected to be announced this week, new power plants will have to emit no more than 1,000 pounds of carbon dioxide per megawatt-hour of energy produced. That standard permits the level of emissions achieved by natural gas-fired plants of the type generally built in the last few years,  but would be too strict for almost all coal-fired power plants if they were not exempted.  A new natural gas plant produces a little less than 1,000 pounds of carbon dioxide per megawatt-hour of electricity generated. A coal plant produces about 1,800 pounds.A senior White House official who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to disclose details ahead of the announcement said, “This standard provides a clear and certain path forward for industry and the important domestic energy sources they rely on, including natural gas, as well as clean coal technologies that lower carbon emissions. These sources will continue to be a part of our energy future, and what we have proposed is in line with the steps industry is already taking.”The White House official explained that the goal of the rule is to hasten the introduction of carbon controls on new coal-fired power plants, while not causing immediate economic harm from the shutdown of existing plants. The rule is certain to face stiff challenges in Congress and the courts.'"
"'12-03-27,'0','But Goodell also made clear that the Saints repeatedly covered up the bounty program when questioned by the league, and that contributed to the severe penalties. Benson addressed owners about the bounty scandal Monday.“He was very open with the clubs,” Goodell said. “He expressed his disappointment that this occurred, that it’s not what he’s all about and he expects to take whatever steps necessary to make sure it doesn’t happen again.”PARCELLS AS SAINTS’ FILL-IN? Sean Payton may address his yearlong suspension with the news media during these meetings, but first he may discuss his job with his mentor, Bill Parcells. ESPN reported Monday that Payton planned to talk to Parcells about filling in for him during his suspension. Parcells attended the Mets’ spring training game against the Cardinals on Monday, and when asked about the possibility that he could join the Saints, he responded, “I have nothing to say.”Goodell said the Saints were allowed to hire from outside their own staff to find a fill-in for Payton, but they would not be allowed to hire anybody currently on another team’s staff. And if the Saints wanted to hire Parcells, they would have to abide by the Rooney Rule, which mandates that at least one minority candidate be interviewed before the hire could be made.Payton’s agent, Don Yee, said Monday in a statement that no decision had been made about whether Payton would appeal the suspension. Payton has until April 2 to appeal, and Goodell said Payton would be allowed to continue working until Goodell decides the appeal.It had been believed that the Saints would make one of their current assistants — the offensive coordinator Pete Carmichael, the offensive line coach Aaron Kromer or the defense coordinator Steve Spagnuolo, the most likely — the interim head coach. The Saints declined to comment Monday on the report that Payton would pursue Parcells.Parcells last coached in 2006 for the Dallas Cowboys, and then he worked for the Miami Dolphins as their top football executive. He fell just short of induction into the Pro Football Hall of Fame this year.TWO TEAMS PLEAD THEIR CASES The Cowboys’ owner, Jerry Jones, and the Redskins’ general manager, Bruce Allen, addressed owners, according to people briefed on the meeting, pleading the teams’ cases for not being docked salary-cap space in a dispute over how contracts were structured during the 2010 season, which was uncapped.The teams think they did nothing wrong in dumping salaries into the uncapped season because there were no rules governing how they spent money.But the owners’ management council felt that the teams tried to gain an unfair competitive advantage in future years by structuring contracts to take advantage of no cap — something teams were repeatedly warned about — and that the competitive integrity of the league was threatened as a result. Dallas will lose $10 million in cap space over the next two years, and Washington will lose $36 million.The teams have filed for arbitration but apparently made little headway in swaying other owners to support them in the fight with the league and the players union, which signed off on the penalties in exchange for the league raising the salary-cap number.After they spoke, according to people briefed on the conversation among owners, a hand vote was taken to gauge support for the measures, and it yielded overwhelming support for the sanctions.EXTRA POINTS Roger Goodell said he told baseball’s commissioner, Bud Selig, that if Stan Kroenke, the owner of the St. Louis Rams, wins the bidding to buy the Dodgers, his league would move quickly to resolve cross-ownership issues that could complicate the purchase. The issues are also complicated by the N.F.L.’s desire to consider the site at Dodger Stadium for a football team and a new stadium.'"
"'12-03-27,'0','NEW DELHI — Over the past year, nearly 30 Tibetans in remote areas of western China have set fire to themselves to draw attention to what they call Chinese government repression, but the visual images of their protests have seldom been seen by outsiders. Censorship authorities in China, which regards the immolation as a form of terrorism, have made sure of it.On Monday, however, a 26-year-old Tibetan exile in New Delhi offered the world a visceral view of a self-immolation, setting himself on fire at a demonstration to protest the impending visit to India by China’s president, Hu Jintao. Photographs of the man, a literal human torch in flames who sprinted for 50 yards with contorted screams before he collapsed by a tree, raced around the world by way of India’s unfettered press and the Internet.“From head to toe, he was full of fire,” said a witness, Tenzin Dorjee, the national director of Students for a Free Tibet. “He was shouting. I was in shock. There were women crying.”The exile, identified by the police as Jampa Yeshi, who left Tibet in 2006 and has lived in India for at least two years, apparently had soaked himself in flammable liquid unbeknownst to fellow activists at the demonstration. They scrambled to extinguish the flames by smothering them with Tibetan flags and sloshing Mr. Yeshi with water. Vast sections of his skin were blackened, and he was in critical condition late Monday at a local hospital, Tibetan exile news sites reported.At least 600 Tibetan protesters from India’s Tibetan community-in-exile had been demonstrating, some carrying signs that read “Tibet Is Burning” and “Tibet Is Not Part of China,” when the self-immolation occurred.'"
"'12-03-27,'0','SAN FRANCISCO — Less than four years after Huawei Technologies and Symantec teamed up to develop computer network security products, the joint venture is being dismantled because Symantec feared the alliance with the Chinese company would prevent it from obtaining United States government classified information about cyberthreats.According to two people briefed on the deal, Symantec’s decision was a pre-emptive political maneuver timed to coincide with the United States government’s efforts to share more classified cyberthreat information with the private sector. People with knowledge of the venture, who would speak only on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak, said Huawei had already laid off several workers in Huawei Symantec’s Silicon Valley offices this month and planned to move its entire operation out of the United States, largely because of increased American government oversight.In the next two weeks, Symantec, the Mountain View, Calif., computer security software firm, is expected to sell its 49 percent stake in the venture to Huawei for $530 million. The companies first announced the sale last November. In a news release, Enrique Salem, Symantec’s chief executive, said the project had “achieved the objectives we set four years ago” and would “exit the joint venture with a good return on our investment.”As online espionage proliferates, the United States government has grappled with how best to share its classified cyberthreat intelligence with the private sector. In January, the Pentagon transferred an information-sharing pilot program, called the Joint Cybersecurity Services Pilot, to the Department of Homeland Security. The program was originally intended to share classified National Security Agency intelligence with military contractors. Homeland Security is expected to extend the program beyond those companies to antivirus companies, like Symantec, and network providers.Symantec worried that its ties to Huawei would be a disadvantage when it came to being the recipient of classified threat information, according to the two people briefed on the matter. Cris Paden, a Symantec spokesman, declined to comment.William Plummer, a Huawei spokesman, said that from Huawei’s perspective “both companies had a positive experience with the joint venture.” He added, “We are going to streamline the organization market by market including in the U.S.”National security concerns have long dogged Huawei. Ren Zhengfei, Huawei’s founder and chief executive, is a former officer in China’s People’s Liberation Army, and American government officials and regulators have repeatedly raised concerns about Huawei’s close ties to the Chinese government.'"
"'12-03-27,'0','Summitt and Mulkey embraced again with 46.8 seconds left after a tense moment on the court. Baylor’s 6-foot-8 center Brittney Griner (23 points, 15 rebounds, 9 blocked shots) and two teammates were ejected for leaving the bench after a near scuffle between Baylor guard Odyssey Sims (27 points) and Tennessee’s Shekinna Stricklen. But tensions quickly eased and players on both teams hugged. N.C.A.A. officials said no Baylor players would face suspensions at the Final Four.Summitt skipped her postgame radio show courtside as Baylor (38-0) celebrated. She has not spoken this season at news conferences. If Summitt’s career has ended as a head coach, it is unsurpassed with 8 national titles and 1,098 victories. Significantly, these achievements bloomed from rural soil.While the N.C.A.A. dismissed women’s basketball, not sponsoring a tournament until 1982, the sport flourished in small towns in places like Texas and Tennessee. Girls who lived and worked on farms, as Summitt did, baling hay, plowing tobacco fields, eating her sack lunch on a tractor, could hardly be told that they lacked the stamina to play basketball.In 1974, Summitt became the coach at Tennessee. Her salary was $250 a month to coach, teach physical education and attend graduate school. She laundered the team uniforms, drove the team van and was so intent on winning that “we never even stopped at McDonald’s,” Warlick said.Quickly, Summitt learned that the best coaches were those with the best players. “Don’t take donkeys to the Kentucky Derby,” her father, Richard Head, told her.She demanded college administrators take her sport seriously when few did. In the 1970s, Tennessee went into overtime during a game at Louisiana State. The men’s teams were scheduled to play next and, Dale Brown, the L.S.U. men’s coach, wanted the women to play their overtime period in an auxiliary gym, according to the Lady Vols. Summitt refused.Later, when Tennessee officials asked whether Summitt was interested in coaching the men’s team, she replied, “Why is that considered a step up?”She demanded from her players the same discipline and work ethic she developed as a girl, when her father often reminded her, “Cows don’t take a day off.” Other women’s teams could learn from this insistence, said Geno Auriemma, Summitt’s rival who has won seven national championships at Connecticut.“She is one of the few coaches who are coaching basketball players and not girls,” he said.Summitt was unapologetic about her forceful approach. Her stare could be icy, her voice blistering. Many years ago in the preseason, Summitt called a student into her office and yelled at her: “What have you been doing? Did I not tell you that you had to lose 10 pounds?” Only later did Summitt realize that the student was a team manager and not a walk-on player.“Her face was all red,” Warlick said with a laugh. “She was so intense, ripping into this poor manager.”While that relationship was quickly repaired, Summitt permanently soured on Auriemma over UConn’s recruitment of Maya Moore. She canceled the annual series between Tennessee and UConn. It was a mistake. Summitt had spent her career as a basketball evangelical, spreading the word, playing anyone, anywhere, anytime. Then, without full explanation, she halted her sport’s most necessary rivalry.Still, the career scale has tipped lopsidedly in Summitt’s favor. The championships are important, sure, but “I’ve never gotten a sense that her success is who she is,” said Bonnie Henrickson, the women’s coach at Kansas. Instead, Henrickson and others said they most appreciated Summitt for her graciousness, for the notes she sent and the patient, encouraging conversations she had with younger coaches who aspired to follow in her path.Weeks before the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics, Mulkey, a point guard, developed a stress fracture in her foot. Summitt showed her loyalty by keeping a spot on the team for Mulkey, who recovered to win a gold medal.Twenty years ago, Mulkey was an assistant at Louisiana Tech, pregnant with her daughter Makenzie, worried that she could not be both a coach and a mother. Summitt, who had a young son named Tyler, assured her that she could.“It comforted me,” Mulkey said. “She was speaking a language I understood. She lived the life I lived.”Mulkey learned another lesson from Summitt. It occurred in the 1980s, when Louisiana Tech was a dominant power in women’s basketball. “I’m going to keep playing you until I beat you,” Summitt told the Tech coaching staff, “and become what you are.”So, Mulkey said, Monday’s game was about business, not honor. Summitt would have it no other way.'"

"'12-03-27,'0','Women who choose to have a vaginal birth after a previous Caesarean section may be at a slightly increased risk of complications.Researchers at the University of Adelaide in Australia studied 2,345 women who had had a Caesarean birth; 1,237 chose to have a subsequent vaginal delivery, while the rest chose a repeat Caesarean. All of the participants had full-term babies and were considered by their obstetricians eligible for a planned vaginal birth.There were no infant or maternal deaths in either group, but there were two stillbirths of unknown cause in the vaginal group. By most measures, there was little difference between the groups in maternal or infant health.But women who gave birth vaginally were significantly more likely to have a serious hemorrhage or to require blood transfusion, the researchers found. And among the vaginal deliveries, 2.3 percent of babies suffered serious neonatal medical problems, compared with less than 1 percent of those delivered by Caesarean.The researchers, led by Dr. Caroline A. Crowther, an obstetrician at the University of Adelaide, conclude that there is a slightly increased risk for fetal or infant death with a vaginal birth after Caesarean, but that the risk is not great. The authors added that their study provides no information about long-term risks.The study appeared online this month in PLoS Medicine.'"
"'12-03-27,'0','For most transplant patients, a kidney received from a donor as old as 64 is just as likely to be successful as one from a younger person, according to a new analysis.Using data from more than 50,000 living donor transplants from 1998 through 2003, researchers at the University of British Columbia concluded that the age of the donor made no difference to the eventual success of the transplant — except for recipients ages 18 to 39, who were more likely to succeed with a donor their own age. Patients in this group accounted for about a quarter of all the patients studied.The scientists also analyzed lists of people waiting for a kidney from a deceased donor and found that the probability of becoming ineligible for donation within three years was high, varying from 21 percent to 66 percent, depending on age, blood group and severity of disease.Waiting can be fatal, the authors contend, and an offer of a kidney should not be rejected simply because of the donor’s age.The senior author of the study, Dr. John S. Gill, an associate professor of medicine at the University of British Columbia, said that in a kidney exchange, many participants are concerned that the kidneys received by family members or friends be as good as the ones they are donating. “Accepting an older donor up to the age of 64 does not negatively impact your outcome,” Dr. Gill said.The report appears online in the Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology.'"
"'12-03-27,'0','It also shows renewed determination to shore up the stability of the euro zone while the overall European economy remains fragile and concerns are mounting about the Spanish government’s rising costs of borrowing.Ms. Merkel and her finance minister, Wolfgang Schäuble, have long opposed expanding the bailout fund any further, as they seek to shield German taxpayers from higher liabilities. There is already widespread discontent among Germans about shouldering most of the cost of rescuing weaker European partners like Greece.Germany also was hesitant to commit more money before countries that might eventually need assistance, including Italy and Spain, showed they were serious about removing barriers to competition and other impediments to growth, said Silvio Peruzzo, an economist at the Royal Bank of Scotland.“The German strategy has been pretty clear,” he said. “They wanted to keep the pressure on some euro zone member states in terms of reforms.”The money already given out in loans by the temporary bailout fund — known as the European Financial Stability Facility — was originally supposed to count against the lending power of the permanent fund when it goes into effect this summer.But under the new flexibility indicated by Ms. Merkel, the temporary fund’s lending program might be allowed to continue without counting against the new 500-billion-euro fund, known as the European Stability Mechanism, when it goes into operation in July.The new fund will spread the risk more evenly among the participating nations than the temporary fund, which left German taxpayers more exposed.Deploying unused sums from the temporary fund, and not counting its outstanding loans against the new fund would effectively bring total lending power to about 692 billion euros.Under existing plans, the temporary fund “will run out in the middle of next year, just as planned,” Ms. Merkel told reporter at her party headquarters.“But 200 billion have already been handed out there, and we could imagine that these 200 billion run in parallel to the E.S.M. until the program countries have paid it back,” she said. “That will take a few years and then the E.S.M. will stand alone again.”Just how all this might work is something the finance ministers will very likely wrestle with in Copenhagen on Friday. The discussion will involve whether the two funds “are able to run parallel to one another, what their relationship is to one another,” said Martin Kotthaus, a spokesman for the German Finance Ministry.But he said the discussion would not be about “whether to increase the” size of the new fund.Mr. Peruzzo, the Royal Bank analyst, said Ms. Merkel would probably need approval from the German Parliament to move ahead with the strategy. “In a way, it’s just a political commitment,” he said. “It’s a signaling device, which is very important at this stage for the crisis.”The idea of allowing the two funds to run in parallel apparently emerged during a meeting last month of the Group of 20 finance ministers in Mexico City, as a way of overcoming German opposition to increasing the firewall while satisfying the demands of Germany’s partners in the Union and the G-20.Upon his return from the G-20 meeting, Mr. Schäuble, the German finance minister, began discussions among leaders of Ms. Merkel’s Christian Democrats, as well as its sister party, the Christian Social Union in Bavaria, said a party official who declined to give his name because he was not authorized to speak about the talks. Party leaders met separately in Berlin and Munich on Monday to agree to the proposal.Ms. Merkel emphasized that if euro zone governments reached agreement on the new strategy, it “could be the basis” for the International Monetary Fund to use more resources to help contain financial turmoil in Europe.The I.M.F. has contributed to the bailouts of Greece, Portugal and Ireland.Olli Rehn, the European Union commissioner for economic and monetary affairs, said Monday in Helsinki that he expected a sufficiently strong plan to be mapped out on Friday in Copenhagen for the I.M.F. to increase its contribution to the European effort. The I.M.F. is to hold its annual meeting in late April.“Negotiations are ongoing, and my aim is to secure that a strong enough stability fund can be created to convince our partners they should reinforce the I.M.F.’s resources,” he said.'"
"'12-03-27,'0','Among the handful of opponents was Keli Carender, a 32-year-old activist from who was an early organizer.“If we know how inefficient and inept the government is, why would you want it to make this decision for you?” she said, holding a yellow “Don’t Tread on Me” flag and wearing pink-rimmed sunglasses.Ms. Carender said she received through her job, but that if the bill was allowed to stand, she said she would drop the policy in protest.“I am not going to trade my health for my freedom,” she said.Shortly after 8 a.m., the line of bedraggled hopefuls who had been waiting for tickets all weekend began to be let into the courtroom. A woman applying makeup who would only give her first name, Donna, said that she had arrived at midnight and that her thick red wool blanket had not been enough against the cold. She added that she was working for a company that was paying her to wait in line, and that she was waiting for a ticket to Tuesday’s hearing.Those with tickets to Monday’s hearing will hear the justices consider whether they are barred from hearing the case until the first penalties come due in 2015.The answer to that question is not obvious. The United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, in , Va., ruled last year that it was powerless to decide the law’s constitutionality for now, and a prominent judge on the Court of Appeals for the Circuit agreed.Their opinions relied on an 1867 federal law called the Anti-Injunction Act, which says that “no suit for the purpose of restraining the assessment or collection of any shall be maintained in any court by any person.” In other words, people who object to taxes must pay first and litigate later.But the first penalties do not kick in until 2014, and they must be paid on federal tax returns by April 2015. That means, the appeals court judges said, that federal courts are forbidden for now to hear challenges to the health care law.The Obama administration pressed this argument in trial courts but abandoned it on appeal. The challengers to the law have always said the 1867 law poses no obstacle to immediate review.In the Supreme Court, the administration suggested that the justices appoint an outside lawyer to argue that the 1867 law bars the challenges. The justices asked Robert A. Long to do so, and he goes first on Monday.Mr. Long is to be followed by two lawyers: Solicitor General and Gregory G. Katsas, who represents the private parties challenging the law.Mr. Long says the 1867 law is “jurisdictional,” meaning it forbids courts to hear suits even if, as here, neither side objects.In the health care law, Congress called the required payment a penalty rather than a tax. But the penalty is contained in the Internal Revenue Code, and the health care law says it is to be “assessed and collected in the same manner” as a tax.Mr. Verrilli, representing the Obama administration, walks a fine line. He has told the court that the administration wants a prompt ruling on the health care law and that the 1867 law should not stand in the way. Yet the administration does not want to damage its ability to rely on the 1867 law in other cases.There are other complications. Mr. Verrilli’s argument that the penalty is not a tax for purposes of the 1867 law is in potential tension with one he will make on Tuesday, that the mandate was authorized not only by Congress’s power under the commerce clause but also by its power to levy taxes.Mr. Verrilli argues that the name that Congress gave the payment required for violating the mandate in the health care law —a penalty, not a tax — matters for purposes of the 1867 law but is irrelevant in connection with the constitutional taxing power, where “it is the practical operation of the provision, not its label, that controls.”The challengers to the law, represented by Mr. Katsas, agree with Mr. Verrilli that the court may decide the case on the merits. He says the penalty for failing to obtain insurance is not the sort of tax the 1867 law concerns. Mr. Long responds that the term “tax” in the 1867 law has been interpreted very broadly.Mr. Katsas also says the challenge is in any event to the mandate, which applies to virtually every American, rather than to the penalty, which applies to a smaller group. Mr. Long responds that the challenge is to both provisions and that striking down the mandate would have the same effect as a premature ruling to forbid the assessment of the penalty.In a brief filed with the court, the states challenging the health care law press a further argument. They say the 1867 law does not, in any event, apply to them even if it applies to the private challengers.An oddity of the case is that a ruling from the Supreme Court that it lacks jurisdiction could be easily reversed by Congress, which is free at any time to amend the 1867 law. The prospect of having to rehear the case in short order may not be attractive to the justices.'"
"'12-03-27,'0','Asked about Mr. Heywood’s death and the British request, the Chinese Foreign Ministry’s spokesman said he had no information on the matter.Mr. Bo was forced to step down as Chongqing’s party secretary on March 15 in a scandal involving the city’s former police chief and vice mayor, Wang Lijun, once among Mr. Bo’s closest advisers. The Communist Party’s preliminary inquiry into the matter, summarized in a leaked transcript this month, quoted Mr. Wang as charging that Mr. Bo had stripped him of his police duties and demoted him to a lower city post after Mr. Wang told him that a criminal investigation had touched on Mr. Bo’s family.Mr. Wang, saying he feared for his safety, fled on Feb. 6 to the Consulate in , almost 170 miles northwest of Chongqing, where he asked for political asylum. He left the consulate about a day later, and Chinese security officials took him to Beijing.A person with knowledge of consular discussions said American officials passed Mr. Heywood’s name to the British Embassy after Mr. Wang had sought asylum at the United States Consulate. Although the person said the nature of Mr. Wang’s allegations was not clear, it is understood that he claimed that Mr. Heywood had not died of an alcohol overdose, but had been poisoned.The , which first reported details of Mr. Wang’s allegations on Monday, quoted sources as saying that Mr. Heywood had been in a business dispute with Mr. Bo’s wife, Gu Kailai. Mr. Heywood’s acquaintance said that he knew of no business dispute, but that he had heard “the relationship had cooled a bit.”The Chinese authorities have said that they will release the results of their final investigation into Mr. Heywood’s activities.The acquaintance said Mr. Heywood, reportedly 41 when he died, had a reputation for helping others gain access to Mr. Bo. Mr. Heywood was said to have met Mr. Bo’s family in Dalian, where Mr. Bo was mayor from 1994 to 2000 before serving as governor of Liaoning Province until 2004.The acquaintance, who asked not to be identified for fear of repercussions, said Mr. Heywood was then working at a Dalian English-language school and had helped Mr. Bo’s son, Bo Guagua, obtain an education in Britain. He studied at the prestigious Harrow School and later at and Harvard.Friends who had known him at Warwick University in the English midlands said that Mr. Heywood, from a well-to-do British family, took an almost maverick pride for someone of his generation in Britain, its history and its institutions.They were quite surprised, they said, when in his early 20’s he moved to Beijing and studied Mandarin.Mr. Heywood married a Chinese woman in Dalian, the friends said, and the couple have two young children.Mr. Heywood went about building a life and a lucrative career in Beijing very separate from the life he had left behind in Britain, according to his friends. He became an executive and independent business consultant for a wide array of Western companies seeking a foothold in China’s booming markets. Among the companies he represented were Aston Martin and Rolls-Royce, which has developed one of its most lucrative markets among China’s growing ranks of millionaires.Why Mr. Heywood was in Chongqing in November is not known. One company that hired him was Hakluyt, a strategic intelligence firm in co-founded by a former officer of Britain’s secret intelligence service, a connection first reported by The Journal. A Hakluyt spokesman in London said Mr. Heywood had worked on a case-by-case basis, but had not been on an assignment for it in Chongqing when he died.“Neil had a long history of advising Western companies on China, and we were among those who sought his advice,” the spokesman said. “We’re greatly saddened by his death.”Friends who attended a memorial service for Mr. Heywood in an in a London suburb said they were left with pressing questions about the circumstances of his death and were aware that it was looked on with suspicion by the British authorities and his friends in China. “The question seemed to be,” said one friend, “had he been killed because of something to do with industrial espionage?”Rumors of a connection between the Wang scandal and Mr. Heywood’s death first emerged in mid-February on China’s weibos, -like microblogs.According to people familiar with those allegations, a Chinese journalist who had been in contact with Mr. Wang received a mysterious text message on a cellphone that he had used to call the police chief. The message said Mr. Wang had been prevented from investigating Mr. Heywood’s death and had to seek refuge in the American Consulate.Hoping to discover who had sent the text message, the journalist posted it on a microblog. Censors later deleted it.The latest revelations added new intrigue to what was already regarded as the most serious split in China’s leadership since Communist leaders and elders ousted the party’s titular head, , after the protests of 1989.Mr. Bo gained widespread popularity after mounting splashy campaigns to purge officials and businesspeople said to be tied to crime, redistribute wealth, and urbanize rural residents.Mr. Bo’s political support and the campaign’s seeming success made him a candidate to join China’s top ruling body, the Standing Committee of the Politburo. But a number of political analysts say he was a long shot.His open ambition and statist approach to Chongqing’s development drew strong opposition from President , Prime Minister and other leaders who saw it as a threat to their governing model.The scandal and Mr. Heywood’s death appear to have offered critics an opening to sideline a potentially powerful rival.“Even if there was this matter of the Englishman, it is far from the whole story,” said one political analyst with ties to high-level Chinese officials, who requested anonymity for fear of repercussions. “The core of the matter is not just what happened between Wang and Bo. It’s the underlying political struggle.”'"

"'12-03-28,'0','There are concerns, though, that Mohammed Merah may have changed that.The seven brutal killings carried out this month by Mr. Merah — a 23-year-old son of Toulouse, and a professed jihadi — occurred during a divisive presidential race that had already turned toward questions of immigration and Islam. Even though investigators say Mr. Merah was effectively a lone, self-radicalized extremist, his violent ideology fits closely with some French stereotypes of Islam, and Muslims here fear that the tensions brought on by the murders may prove more lasting.“All of this does not correspond at all with what Toulouse is,” Pierre Cohen, the mayor, said of the killings. But “we’ve just come out of a very tense period,” he said. “Unfortunately, this risk exists.”Already, a false rumor has spread through the city, Mr. Cohen said, suggesting that Muslims were organizing a demonstration in defense of Mr. Merah.“There will be a ‘before’ and an ‘after,’ ” said Yassin Elmu’min, 23, a round-faced young man with blue eyes and short hair slicked into tight curls. Typically, Mr. Elmu’min said, there is “dialogue” between cultures in Toulouse, and Muslims are treated well. But he and other Muslims, many living in the poor suburbs outside downtown Toulouse, said they had already begun to detect nervous gazes that were uncharacteristic of this city.“Someone had the nerve to ask me, ‘Do you agree with what he did?’ ” Mr. Elmu’min said, exasperated. President Nicolas Sarkozy called for the rejection of “easy falsehoods” about Muslims last week, after Mr. Merah was killed by police commandos, Mr. Elmu’min said. “The ‘easy falsehoods’ are already here,” he lamented.A friend, Abd’allah, 19, dressed in a cream-colored djellaba beneath a hooded sweatshirt, said, “We’re the victims in the story.” He declined to give his full name, saying he feared trouble from the French authorities.Despite Mr. Sarkozy’s recent appeals for tolerance, many Muslims say he has done much to stigmatize them, pointing often to a 2010 law banning the Islamic full veil, or niqab, and to a debate on “the national identity.”Marine Le Pen, the presidential candidate for the far-right National Front, has been vociferous in her response to the killings.“What happened is not the matter of one man’s madness; what happened is the beginning of the forward march of green fascism in our country,” Ms. Le Pen said on Sunday, referring to radical Islam. “How many Mohammed Merahs are there in the boats, the planes that arrive each day in France, full of immigrants?”Muslim leaders have denounced such attempts to exploit the killings politically. In a statement shortly after Mr. Merah’s death last week, Mohammed Moussaoui, the president of the French Council for the Muslim Faith, asked that the term “Islamism” be abandoned because it “feeds the confusion between Islam and terrorism and brings suffering to millions of Muslims who feel it important to defend the dignity of their faith and their religion.”In Toulouse, Mr. Elmu’min and his friend had come from Friday Prayer at the Mosque of Mirail Toulouse, a sprawling makeshift prayer space in a temporary building at the edge of a mall parking lot, beneath the elevated railroad tracks at the terminus of Line A of the Métro.Mamadou Daffé, the Malian-born imam at the mosque, said he had never been the target of so much as a racist remark in Toulouse.“None, none at all,” Mr. Daffé said. “Maybe this is surprising, but so be it.”Mr. Daffé, who makes his living as a pharmacological researcher, describes himself as a moderate Muslim, a proponent of “local Islam” who preaches in French.But in his address to the hundreds of men who gathered at the mosque on Friday — some in white djellabas, thick beards and skullcaps, but most in jeans, suit coats or leather jackets — he spoke angrily of the “injustices” being wrought against Muslims in France, especially after the killings.Politicians have called for restraint, Mr. Daffé said, but those same politicians have long stoked the very hate they now say they must smother. He called upon the faithful to be exemplary in their behavior, though.“We are responsible for the image that’s been given to Islam, this beautiful religion,” he said. With the murders, which Mr. Merah said he committed in the name of Islam, “God has tested us,” Mr. Daffé said.His fellow cleric, Mr. Tataï, has led a project to build a grand mosque in Toulouse. A decade ago, local authorities were opposed, Mr. Tataï recalled, but gradually warmed to the notion. The domed, multistory ocher building, at the edge of the Empalot neighborhood, adjacent to the highway, is now almost complete. (Uncharacteristically, the mosque will be open to the non-Muslim public, outside hours of prayer.)“Of course there is the fear that there will be backlash from the black week we’ve just lived through,” Mr. Tataï said.He added, “This is a test of the good will and wisdom of the wise.” He remains optimistic.'"
"'12-03-28,'0','“On the surface they appear very different,” commented Daniel Ben-Simon, a left-leaning Labor Party member of who worked with Mr. Barak. “Netanyahu cannot disconnect Israel from the Holocaust. He sees himself as the prime minister of the Jewish people. Barak is the ultimate Israeli, the prince of Zionism. Many thought Barak would rein in Netanyahu on Iran. Instead he joined with him into a two-man show.”While many here fear a catastrophe if Israel strikes at Iran, Mr. Barak and Mr. Netanyahu increasingly argue that there may be no other option. Their view is that given a choice between an Iran with — which they say could use them against Israel directly or through proxies, as well as spur a regional arms race — and the consequences of an attack on Iran before it can go nuclear, the latter is far preferable. There will be a counterattack, they say; people will lose their lives and property will be destroyed. But they say it is the lesser of two evils.“Rockets will fall on this building, but things would be far worse if Iran got the bomb,” said a top former official who has worked for both men, as he sat in a seaside hotel lobby.He added that Mr. Netanyahu and Mr. Barak were “meeting one on one with certain cabinet ministers in order to shape a majority in the 14,” referring to the 14-member security cabinet.They have known each other a long time and have developed a strong mutual dependence. Mr. Barak’s political career, which once seemed so promising, now relies heavily on his relationship with Mr. Netanyahu. And given Mr. Netanyahu’s limited military experience, without the backing of Mr. Barak, who is seen as a military mastermind, he would have trouble winning support for his policy.Mr. Barak, 70, was a commander of Mr. Netanyahu, 62, in the elite Sayeret Matkal unit in which they both served in the early 1970s. Both have also grown relatively wealthy in recent years from speeches and consulting when not in government, and both feel they understand American politics especially well.If they did decide to attack, they would need the backing of a majority of the security cabinet. Most estimates are that they would get that support, although the vote might be as close as 8 to 6. But by keeping the issue off the cabinet’s agenda for now, they could be counting on seeking an 11th-hour vote, when it would be harder for ministers to oppose the attack.Earlier cabinet meetings offer clues as to why they might be avoiding the issue. In its three years, the cabinet held a number of meetings devoted to Iran, according to top officials who add that defense officials and several ministers opposed military action, at least so far.“They haven’t done it until now,” a top official who is unenthusiastic about an attack said. “Ask yourself why.”Iran says its is purely for civilian use, although Western powers believe its goal is to produce weapons. Israel points to repeated statements by Iranian leaders calling for its destruction and by Iran’s financing and arming of groups fighting Israel. Still, the says that diplomacy and sanctions against Iran’s financial and energy industries need time before military action should be considered.Mr. Netanyahu’s recent trip to Washington is widely thought to have gained some of that time, with no attack expected in the next few months.Both Mr. Netanyahu and Mr. Barak say they will be delighted if pressure on Iran leads it to drop its nuclear program. Neither thinks it likely, however, because of the short time frame as Iran moves its centrifuges underground, beyond Israel’s military ability to destroy them.Public opinion on the matter is unclear, although Mr. Netanyahu remains very popular and Mr. Barak is widely respected as defense minister. In polls about Iran, different questions produce different results. One poll asked Israelis if they favored an attack without American help and a sizable majority, 63 percent, said no. But another asked whether Israelis considered an attack on Iran riskier than “living in the shadow of an Iranian nuclear bomb” and 65 percent preferred the attack, in keeping with the Netanyahu-Barak argument. Some say it is the unusual combination of Mr. Netanyahu with Mr. Barak that could lead to an attack, and while some are grateful, others are terrified. Meir Dagan, a former head of the Mossad spy agency, has complained that the two leaders cannot be trusted to make the right decision.Ben Caspit, a political columnist for the Maariv newspaper, a former Likud activist and a harsh critic of Mr. Netanyahu’s, wrote in the paper last weekend that he viewed them as dangerous.Using Mr. Netanyahu’s nickname, he said: “Bibi is a messianist. He believes with all his soul and every last molecule of his being that he — I don’t quite know how to express it — is King David. He’s not cynical in the least. The cynic here is Barak. The fortunate thing is that Bibi’s a coward. The dangerous thing is that he’s got Barak beside him.”'"
"'12-03-28,'0','But for the relatively small universe of people who resist buying coverage, the mandate is a bitter pill. Teofilo Cuevas, 51, who earns about $40,000 a year as a meat cutter at a grocery store, said he had decided to drop his employer-provided coverage because even with insurance, he could not afford his out-of-pocket costs. He said he avoided going to the doctor.“A lot of people cannot pay this,” Mr. Cuevas, an immigrant from the , said through an interpreter.For individuals facing penalties, who are often young, male and healthy, the state appears to have been generous in granting one-year waivers. From 2007 through 2010, the state approved 65 percent of the appeals filed by people who had been given penalties, or 7,163 out of 10,992, according to the Health Connector. State officials said appeals were granted based on proof of financial hardship, which might involve unemployment, a foreclosure or period of homelessness, or having to make the choice between paying for insurance or for heat and electricity.“It’s a very humane and fair appeals process that gives people the opportunity to tell their story in full,” Mr. Shor said.But some small business owners also feel unfairly targeted by the law, which requires employers with the equivalent of 11 or more full-time employees to offer coverage or pay a penalty of $295 per employee. Mr. Cuevas’s employer, Ronn Garry Jr., owner of Tropical Foods, a grocery store in the Roxbury section of Boston, is facing nearly $30,000 in penalties because not enough of his 70 employees signed up for his employer-provided plan over an 18-month period, he said. “It’s frustrating,” Mr. Garry said of the law, “because I support it but I also feel victimized by it.”He added, “Most people want to have coverage but they have to make dollars-and-cents decisions.”Over all, 4.6 percent of the employers who are required to offer coverage, or about 1,000, were penalized for noncompliance in 2010, according to the state. The state’s Division of Unemployment Assistance enforces the rule; compliance improved to about 95 percent from about 88 percent from 2007 to 2010. Money from the penalties helps offset the cost of state-subsidized health insurance.William Fields, a consultant in Boston who helps employers comply with the law, said restaurants and stores often struggled to avoid penalties, known in state parlance as “fair share contributions.”“You have some of those who are truly bad guys and should be fined,” Mr. Fields said. “But the ones that are personal to me are the $50,000 fine that puts my client out of business.”Robert J. Blendon, a professor of health policy at Harvard, said that while the individual mandate had more or less succeeded in Massachusetts, it would have a much harder road to acceptance in states where more of the population is uninsured. Even before the 2006 law, Massachusetts had more residents with health insurance than most other states.“Everybody says, ‘Well if they’re happy with it here, won’t they be happy with it in ?’ ” Dr. Blendon said. “I don’t think you can get from one to the other because the numbers of uninsured are so much larger.”Polls suggest that most people here like the state law, although fewer support the individual mandate specifically. A statewide poll last year by the Harvard School of Public Health and found that 63 percent of residents supported the overall law, while 51 percent supported the individual mandate.But while the Massachusetts law is popular for now — an effort to get a question on the ballot this fall asking voters to repeal the individual mandate failed to collect enough signatures — it could lose support if health care costs, already prohibitively expensive here, continue to rise. Gov. , a Democrat, has called for reining in costs by changing the way doctors and hospitals are paid, but the legislature has not taken action.Amy Whitcomb Slemmer, executive director of Health Care for All, an advocacy group here, said the federal health care law would help by extending subsidized coverage to some people who do not qualify for it under the Massachusetts law. Many such people, she said, are currently “right on the margin, trying to live with the mandate and it’s just a strain on their budget.”Because it is not a federal statute, the Massachusetts law would survive even if the Supreme Court finds the national mandate unconstitutional. Nevertheless, Mr. Lodor said he was eager for the justices to strike the federal law down.Mr. Lodor, who is divorced and pays for his daughter to be insured through a plan her college offers, acknowledged that he was “rolling the dice” by forgoing insurance. He is not against buying catastrophic coverage, he said, but that alone would not meet the state’s “minimum creditable coverage” requirement.“I really feel strongly this isn’t something that should be foisted on me,” he said.'"
"'12-03-28,'0','“The customer knows the right price,” said the chief executive of J. C. Penney, Ron Johnson. “We can raise the price all we want; she’s only going to pay the right price. And why is that? Because she’s an expert.”Penney’s argues its proof is in the math. Over the last decade, higher prices did not make customers spend more, said Mr. Johnson, who took over the top job last year after running the retail operations at .An item that cost Penney’s $10 in 2002 was typically marked up to $28. By 2011, a $10 item had been marked up to $40. But the price the customer actually paid for the $10 item increased only 5 cents during that period — to $15.95, from $15.90.Until 40 percent off, “the customer doesn’t even pay attention,” Mr. Johnson said.Ronald S. Friedman, the head of the retail group at Marcum L.L.P., an accounting firm that advises department stores and manufacturers, said the average markup for apparel at a department store began around 65 percent. Over 10 weeks, the stores will go to 25 or 30 percent off, then 50 percent off, 60 percent, and finally 70 percent or more, a discount so deep that the stores sometimes sell below cost.“The shopper knows to wait for the sale,” he said. “They know the prices are inflated when they first come out.”The new pricing at J. C. Penney is intended to break that mind-set, and the company is betting its turnaround on it.The store has cut prices by about 40 percent versus before the change, and rounded prices to the nearest dollar ($12, say, versus $11.95 or $11.99). After that first tier of regular prices are specials, which last a month rather than a day or a few hours. And Tier 3 is clearance items, which go on sale the first and third Friday of every month, in tandem with many paycheck cycles.J. C. Penney calls it “fair and square pricing,” but some consumers seem to find it confusing.“I really, really miss my coupons,” Robyn Anderson-Beard wrote on the retailer’s Facebook page. Bobbi Cada wrote: This “is not a change at all, there has never been a day in all of my shopping at JCP where ANYTHING has been full price.”And visiting a J. C. Penney in this month, Michelle Clark, a analyst, took note of “sales associates that had difficulty explaining the new pricing strategy,” along with a lack of shoppers.Mr. Johnson said in late February that in the first three weeks, sales were trending below a year ago, but “it is way too early to jump to any conclusions on our new pricing strategy.”Rafi Mohammed, a pricing consultant, said Penney’s merchandise was not unusual enough to draw customers into stores without significant markdowns. “A lot of people feel good about saving money and having a notion of, ‘I saved X percent,’ ” he said. “Consumers do code a $19.99 very differently than a $20.”And history is not on Penney’s side, as similar celebrated pricing experiments have failed. American Airlines tried a system similar to Penney’s in 1992 — and abandoned it after six months.Pointing out that tickets were usually sold for far under face value thanks to promotions, American executives announced that the airline would eliminate 86 percent of the fares it offered. But competitors immediately began undercutting American’s new straightforward prices.Also, about six years ago, after took over a group of regional department stores, it decided that coupons were misleading. It slashed the number of coupons. Within a year, it reinstated the coupons; consumers, it turned out, loved them.“I think it underestimates what a sport discount hunting is,” Mark Ellwood, author of “Chasing the Sale,” a coming book on discounting, said of coupon hunters. “They’re like mathletes with credit cards.”Still, Penney’s is not alone in trying to win over the price-smart shopper.Stein Mart is simplifying its pricing, saying it will reduce coupons by 50 percent this year and get away from the falsely high price tags. “Our prices were built up to a point which was untenable, and the customer realized that,” Jay Stein, Stein Mart’s chairman and interim chief executive, said this month.Urban Outfitters and American Eagle Outfitters are both reworking prices to get away from too-heavy promotions, while Mango has made the bold move of reducing prices by 20 percent beginning this spring. Supervalu recently cut prices on 200 produce items and says it will be reducing sales and “promoting everyday fair pricing,” its chief executive, Craig R. Herkert, said.In the end, it is shoppers like Mr. Vineburgh, the Boston haggler, who will determine if the new strategies work.When something is priced right, he says, he does not try to haggle. Recently he paid the asking price for a composite hockey stick that was marked down to $70, from $150. “The right price, to me, is what I’m willing to pay for something,” he said.'"
"'12-03-28,'0','A federal judge has prohibited the use of imported death penalty drugs and has ordered the Food and Drug Administration to collect the drugs from any states that have imported them. Judge Richard J. Leon of the Federal District Court in Washington ruled Tuesday in a case brought on behalf of death row inmates in Arizona, California and Tennessee. States that use sodium thiopental to render prisoners unconscious as part of their execution protocols reached out to foreign suppliers when the sole domestic manufacturer stopped producing the drug, which had not been approved for importation. The F.D.A. said it had no jurisdiction over execution drugs. Judge Leon wrote that the agency “appears to be simply wrapping itself in the flag of law enforcement discretion to justify its authority and masquerade an otherwise seemingly callous indifference to the health consequences of those imminently facing the executioner’s needle. How utterly disappointing!” Bradford Berenson, a lawyer for the inmates, said the decision proved that “even death row inmates are entitled to the protection of the law.”'"
"'12-03-28,'0','Instead of the usual admonition about silencing cellphones, So Percussion prefaced its concert at Zankel Hall on Monday evening by telling listeners to turn theirs on, to make sure that the volume was all the way up, and to set an alarm — the more obnoxious the better — for 1 hour 18 minutes into the program.That was not the concert’s oddest moment, but it would be hard to find a consensus on what was. Maybe it was seeing these four imaginative percussionists (Eric Beach, Josh Quillen, Adam Sliwinski and Jason Treuting), along with the members of Matmos, an equally innovative electronica duo (Drew Daniel and M. C. Schmidt), playing their alternately tactile and thunderously crunchy collaborative work, “Needles” (2010), on an amplified cactus. Or it could have been a random visual gag: a musician’s suddenly stopping to do push-ups or slice celery stalks or shave off a long, thick beard.But for all that, my guess is that Dan Deacon’s “Take a Deep Breath” (2011) will prove the most memorably peculiar (in a good way) offering of the evening. Audience members were given three pages of specifically timed instructions for the piece — a score, in effect — and told that participation was not optional. Among the demands (most listeners complied, happily and robustly) were “oohing” and “ahhing”; making nonvocal mouth noises; mimicking sounds from the stage; standing and sitting; playing a song from your phone; and switching seats with people at random.It was during Mr. Deacon’s work that the phone alarms sounded.The concert, part of Carnegie Hall’s American Mavericks series, was So Percussion’s contribution to the John Cage centennial celebration, and a work like Mr. Deacon’s, in which elements are carefully plotted yet also partly left to chance, was perfect for the occasion.The program also included another piece by Mr. Deacon — “Bottles” (2011), for amplified soda bottles — as well as Cenk Ergun’s haunting “Use” (2009), for electronics (overseen by the composer), percussion (including a musical saw) and viola (played by Beth Meyers), and pieces in a Cagean spirit by members of So and Matmos.Cage’s own music was also amply represented, though not always as you might expect. Works like “Credo in US” (1942), the opener, and “Third Construction” (1941), the finale, are usually performed as explosions of joyful noise, and at times these performances packed a proper wallop. But more often the So players focused on the subtle, even gentle, sides of the pieces. Several Cage works were presented simultaneously: “45’ for a Speaker,” a reading of one of Cage’s amusing philosophical writings, permeated the second half of the concert.'"

"'12-03-28,'0','DHARAMSALA, India — By Tuesday afternoon, posters of the man in flames were plastered along the narrow streets of this town adopted by Tibetan exiles. Monks, merchants and tourists stared. In the early evening, more than 200 people walked through the town center waving Tibetan flags and carrying banners that proclaimed the critically injured man, Jamphel Yeshi, a martyr.The shocking images of Mr. Yeshi’s self-immolation in New Delhi on Monday have provided the Tibetan exile movement with a rallying point and an iconic expression of the anger and frustration that Tibetans suffer over Chinese rule. At least 29 Tibetans have set themselves on fire in Tibetan areas of China since March 2011, and many have died. But Chinese security forces have clamped down across the plateau, so only a handful of the self-immolations have been recorded and transmitted, and only in grainy cellphone photographs or video.Mr. Yeshi burned himself in front of hundreds of people, during a protest largely by Tibetans before a visit by President Hu Jintao of China, who was scheduled to fly to New Delhi to attend an economic summit meeting. Mr. Yeshi was taken to a hospital with burns over 98 percent of his body, and word of the self-immolation spread quickly through Dharamsala, a hill station in northern India that is the home of the Dalai Lama, the spiritual leader of the Tibetans, and the government-in-exile.On Tuesday, images of Mr. Yeshi proliferated on walls here. One gruesome poster showed his ravaged body in the hospital. A cousin, Sonam Wangyal, visited him and mourned his terrible injuries, The Associated Press reported. But he also said: “We are fighting for freedom. The world should know this.”Details about Mr. Yeshi’s life emerged. Many initial reports that were largely based on Indian police accounts said his first name was Jampa and gave his age as 26, but Tibetan organizations here said with certainty that he was Jamphel Yeshi, 27. Fellow exiles said he was from the Ganzi area in the eastern Tibetan region of Kham, which now lies in China’s Sichuan Province. He left in 2006 and made his way to Dharamsala, where he attended a school that educates refugees in Tibetan history, culture and language. Mr. Yeshi then settled in New Delhi, where he was unemployed and lived with his cousin.'"
"'12-03-28,'0','“The vote tonight has shown us that we still have a lot of work ahead in the fight to end Israeli oppression of Palestinians,” said Liz Roberts, a member of the pro-boycott lobby. “However, despite our loss in tonight’s vote, we have succeeded in one of our goals: B.D.S. has entered into the consciousness of thousands of co-op members and has even made it into mainstream conversations.”The start of the meeting was delayed by 45 minutes as hundreds of members filed into a large auditorium at Brooklyn Technical High School. The meeting had been moved from its usual setting in a local synagogue to accommodate the turnout of more than 1,600, a record for the organization.Over nearly 90 minutes, about four dozen speakers stepped to the microphone and made their arguments.Advocates for the boycott criticized Israeli military action in Gaza and the West Bank, and argued that a ban would be an important symbol in the fight against injustice.Dennis James, who pushed for the boycott, recalled a visit to Gaza in 2009. “I viewed the results of the 22-day bombardment,” he said. “I saw apartment blocks blown apart. The American school flattened. The hospital shot full of holes.”But many opponents of the boycott said the store was no place to adjudicate the politics of the Middle East. Some questioned the motives of the B.D.S. movement.Aaron Dobbs occupied something of a middle ground, saying he was “100 percent against” the B.D.S. movement but “100 percent in favor” of the referendum in order to give the greatest number of members a chance to participate in the vote.The anti-boycott lobby received a boost on Monday, when several of the city’s top politicians expressed their opposition to the ban, including Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, who said he would encourage New Yorkers to do more business with Israel, not less.Irina Ivanova, a boycott supporter, said those officials’ statements were “a little disappointing,” but added, “I can’t say I’m surprised.”She said the Park Slope Food Co-op Members that support the B.D.S. group had received endorsements from a range of activists and social justice organizations, including the writer Alice Walker, the antiwar group Code Pink and Mustafa Barghouti, a Palestinian politician.Boycott supporters had asked even those opposed to a boycott to support the call for a referendum, arguing that a referendum, which would involve a mail-in ballot, would give members more time to vote, thus allowing greater participation.But some members simply wanted the issue to go away as quickly as possible for fear that further debate would foment more divisiveness and damage the organization, which was founded 39 years ago.“These people are insidious, and they destroy communities,” said Peter Raskin, a co-op member speaking about the boycott lobby. “If they have a problem with Israel, let them go to the State Department.”A boycott would have been largely symbolic; the store carries only a few Israeli-made products, among them a seltzer-water maker, organic paprika, two styles of kosher marshmallows and three varieties of tapenade and pesto, said a store founder, Joe Holtz.One of the product manufacturers is PeaceWorks, a company that seeks to encourage peace among rivals through economic cooperation. Its line of tapenades and pestos uses olives grown in Palestinian villages, glass jars made in Egypt and sun-dried tomatoes from Turkey.“The key to resolving the Palestinian-Israeli conflict is greater understanding of each other, not greater polarization,” Joshua Scherz, president of PeaceWorks Foods, said in a statement.Omar Barghouti, a Palestinian human rights advocate and co-founder of the B.D.S. movement, said that regardless of the outcome, the fact that the debate had reached Park Slope reflected the momentum the cause had gained.“We are fast reaching our South Africa moment,” he said in a statement from East Jerusalem.In recent weeks, advocates carrying leaflets have been a common sight on the sidewalk outside the Union Street store. While civility has generally prevailed, two people who apparently hold opposing views on the matter scuffled in front of the store over the weekend.“That makes me very unhappy,” Mr. Holtz said. “I’m hoping that’s the end of that.”'"
"'12-03-28,'0','The declining price of natural gas has made it the fuel of choice in recent years for companies planning new plants. The E.P.A.’s move follows a shift that is already unfolding in the electric power market.The proposed rule is rooted in a 2007 directive from the Supreme Court instructing the E.P.A. to decide whether carbon dioxide was a pollutant under the Clean Air Act. In late 2009, the agency declared that it was, and so had to be regulated.It took more than two years for the agency to work out the regulatory details.To open an avenue to companies still planning to build coal plants, for example, the E.P.A. said it would allow new ones to begin operating with higher levels of emissions as long as the average annual emissions over a period of 30 years met the standard.In a statement, Ms. Jackson called the proposed rules “a common-sense step to reduce pollution in the air, protect the planet for our children and move us into a new era of American energy.”Environmental groups generally applauded the standards, although some expressed disappointment with the agency’s decision not to regulate existing power plants for the moment.“This Environmental Protection Agency action means any new coal plants built in America must use modern, state-of-the-art carbon pollution controls,” Frances Beinecke, the president of the Natural Resources Defense Council, said in a statement. “The logical next step is to improve the aging fleet of existing coal-fired power plants, which remain the major source of industrial carbon pollution in our country.”In a conference call with reporters, Ms. Jackson said that if such action were to be taken in the future, the agency would thoroughly consult with the industry and all others affected.“President Obama’s environmental agenda kills American jobs, creates higher energy prices and weakens our nation’s security,” he said. “America is the Saudi Arabia of coal, and we could create our own energy if the government would let us.  Instead, Barack Obama would rather pick winners and losers in the energy field.”At Peabody Energy, the largest coal mining company in the United States, Vic Svec, a spokesman, questioned the legality of the standard, arguing that the E.P.A. was supposed to set standards based on existing technology and that technology was not ready.A standard of 1,000 pounds per megawatt-hour for coal plants would “require something that doesn’t exist as a commercial technology,” he said.But the lack of a commercial technology for carbon capture is one reason that the E.P.A. could not realistically impose such a requirement on existing plants and decided to push the challenge into the future.Carbon capture has so far proved too expensive to be practical because the chemical work of separating carbon dioxide from the other components of exhaust gas requires large amounts of energy.By some estimates, what is today a 1,000-megawatt coal plant might yield only 700 megawatts after some of its energy went into a carbon capture plant in the form of steam and electricity. And sequestering the gas underground could prove difficult.Michael Brune, executive director of the Sierra Club, said in an interview that ending coal-fired generation as it now exists should be the whole point. “It’s a rule that follows the marketplace,” he said, adding: “Right now, next to no coal plants are being built. This basically means that new coal plants are going extinct.”As for coal plants built in the 1970s or earlier, he said, “we can put them in our rear-view mirror.”'"
"'12-03-28,'0','The prices dialysis providers negotiate with Amgen help determine their profitability, he and other dialysis industry executives say. Without competition, Amgen has been free to set prices and recently raised them significantly, according to some of the executives.Affymax is entering the market as use of the anemia drugs is declining because of safety concerns and a new Medicare payment system. Sales of Epogen, Amgen’s main drug for dialysis, dropped to $2 billion in 2011 from $2.5 billion in 2010.Amgen has also taken steps to lock Affymax out of the market, signing contracts with the two big dialysis chains that together treat around two-thirds of the nation’s roughly 400,000 dialysis patients, virtually all of whom have anemia.In exchange for presumably big discounts from Amgen, one of the chains, DaVita, agreed to use Amgen’s drugs for at least 90 percent of its needs through the end of 2018. Fresenius, the other big chain, signed a three-year nonexclusive deal, according to Amgen’s regulatory filings.John A. Orwin, chief executive of Affymax, which is based in Palo Alto, Calif., said there was still a substantial market in midsize and small dialysis providers.“There’s a group of people who are very anxious to talk to us,” he said in an interview this month. Takeda, the big Japanese drug company, will help market Omontys, which is known generically as peginesatide.Mr. Orwin said Omontys could be given once a month by injection or infusion, while Epogen is typically given three times a week.He said Tuesday that while the list price for Omontys might not be that different from that of Epogen, Affymax intended to make its product less expensive in its contract negotiations with dialysis providers, after factoring in discounts, rebates and the savings in nursing time from the less frequent dosing.“We know we need to be part of the solution to lower costs,” he said. He said a typical cost to treat a patient with Epogen was $6,000 a year, though doses vary.Anemia drugs built Amgen into the world’s biggest biotechnology company. In the early 1980s, as a small start-up, Amgen won a race to isolate the gene for erythropoietin, or Epo, a protein produced in the kidneys that causes the body to produce oxygen-carrying red blood cells. Amgen then spliced the human Epo gene into hamster ovary cells, which were grown in culture and could churn out large quantities of the protein to use as a drug.Since Epogen’s approval in 1989, Amgen has sold more than $37 billion worth of the drug, all of it to treat American dialysis patients. Johnson & Johnson, under a licensing deal with Amgen, sells the same drug under the name Procrit for other uses.Amgen has also sold $26 billion of Aranesp, a longer-lasting form of Epo, though only a small part of that has been for American dialysis patients.Over the years, Amgen has defended its monopoly in patent lawsuits against Genetics Institute, Transkaryotic Therapies and Roche.Amgen divided its seminal invention into several patents, the first of which expired in 2004. But some of the patents were not granted until years later, giving Amgen protection until as late as 2015, longer than the 20 years envisioned in patent law.In Europe there was only one patent, and it expired several years ago. Amgen has since faced competition so there are now near-generic versions of Epogen, known as biosimilars, on the market there.Unlike the drugs found to infringe Amgen’s patent, Omontys is not a version of the Epo protein made in living cells. It consists of two small protein fragments, called peptides, that are made chemically and do not share amino acid sequences with Epo, according to Affymax.Over the years, financial incentives and heavy marketing by Amgen have turned Epogen into a major moneymaker, and one of the largest pharmaceutical expenses for Medicare.Dialysis clinics could make a profit from using Epogen because Medicare and private insurers would reimburse them more than they would pay to buy the drug from Amgen. That gave the clinics an incentive to use more of the drug.But last year Medicare began paying a set fee to cover a complete dialysis treatment, including Epogen. So Epogen has now become a cost that lowers profit, giving clinics an incentive to use as little of the drug as possible. The Food and Drug Administration meanwhile has also increased restrictions on the use of Epo drugs after various studies showed that overuse increased the risk of heart attacks, strokes and other cardiovascular problems.Omontys has the same safety warnings on its label since it is considered in the same class of drugs. Moreover, in clinical trials involving patients with kidney disease who were not undergoing dialysis, those who got Omontys had a higher rate of certain cardiovascular problems than those who received Amgen’s Aranesp.Affymax argued that those patients were distinct from those getting dialysis, where the increased incidence of problems was not seen. An advisory committee to the F.D.A. apparently agreed, recommending approval of Omontys in December by a vote of 15 to 1 with one abstention.But in a post on his blog, the Kidney Doctor, Dr. Ajay K. Singh, an influential nephrologist at Brigham & Women’s Hospital in Boston, questioned whether the division of patients based on whether they undergo dialysis “makes any sense from a safety perspective.”Affymax shares rose 58 cents, to $14.31, on Tuesday. Omontys is the first product approved for the company, which has a market capitalization of around $500 million. Shares of Amgen rose 29 cents to $67.81.Safety could be another issue. In clinical trials involving patients with kidney disease who were not undergoing dialysis, those who got Omontys had a higher rate of certain cardiovascular problems than those who received Amgen’s Aranesp.'"
"'12-03-28,'0','Home prices fell in January for a fifth straight month in most major cities, a new report disclosed Tuesday, but another report said Americans maintained a positive outlook on the nation’s economy.The housing data, the Standard & Poor’s/Case-Shiller home price index, showed that prices dropped in January compared with December in 16 of 19 cities tracked.The steepest declines were in San Francisco, Atlanta and Portland, Ore. Prices increased in Miami, Phoenix and Washington. The declines partly reflect typical offseason sales. The month-over-month data is not adjusted for seasonal factors.Prices fell in 17 of the 20 cities in January compared with January 2011 (when one fewer city was tracked). The group’s nationwide index of prices has fallen 34 percent since the housing bust and is now at 2002 levels.The continued drop in prices suggested the housing market remained weak, even after the best winter for home sales in five years and steady improvement in the job market.'"
"'12-03-28,'0','The administration’s primary argument is that the law is authorized by the commerce clause, which gives Congress the power to regulate commerce “among the several states.” The Supreme Court has read the clause broadly, saying it allows Congress to limit how much wheat may be grown on a family farm and to punish the cultivation of home-grown marijuana.There have been only two modern exceptions to that broad interpretation. In 1995, the court struck down a federal law regulating guns near schools. In 2000, it struck down a federal law allowing suits over violence against women. In both cases, the court said the activity sought to be regulated was local and noncommercial.The decision under review, from the Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit, in , said the health care law overstepped the limits imposed by the commerce clause by regulating inactivity and forcing people into the marketplace.In his main brief, Solicitor General urged the justices to look at the bigger picture.“The minimum coverage provision,” he wrote, using the law’s name for what most people call the individual mandate, “is within Congress’s power to enact not only because it is a necessary component of a broader scheme of interstate regulation, but also because, within that scheme, the provision itself regulates economic conduct with a substantial effect on interstate commerce, namely the way in which individuals finance their participation in the health care market.”Uninsured Americans each year use $43 billion of health care they cannot pay for, effectively transferring those costs to other American families to the tune of about $1,000 per year, Mr. Verrilli said.In response, , representing 26 states challenging the law, said this conception of federal power amounts to “a revolution in the relationship between the central government and the governed.”“If this is to remain a system of limited and enumerated federal powers that respects individual liberty, accountability and the residual dignity and sovereignty of the states, the individual mandate cannot stand.”The federal government also argued that the mandate is separately authorized by Congress’s power to levy taxes. The penalty that people who fail to obtain must pay is calculated as a percentage of their income and is paid to the along with income and other taxes each April.Mr. Clement responded that the challenge is to the mandate, which applies to almost all Americans, rather than the penalty, which applies to a subset of them. In any event, he said, a penalty is not a tax.'"

"'12-03-29,'1','“These things are occurring all the time,” said Tim Quast, a managing director at ModernIR, which helps companies get access to capital markets. “We know that at any given moment something can go awry.”The breakdown at BATS last week points to one of the worst possible outcomes. The exchange company’s own stock plunged as its shares were first offered to the public, leading the company to take the rare step of taking its shares off the market. The drop in Apple’s share price was halted because of new circuit-breaker rules instituted in 2010 by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Trading flowed on to other exchanges. BATS blamed a software error, and regulators are examining the causes.The incident has been described by BATS and other exchanges as an example of how quickly exchanges are able to identify and fix market disruptions. But some market participants say the problems can weaken the stock market on a number of levels. When a stock’s price goes haywire, investors can get locked into bad trades, or shut out of good ones.In addition, minor events at one exchange risk spiraling out through other exchanges and setting off a severe flash crash, like the one seen in May 6, 2010, when major markets fell more than 8 percent in a matter of minutes.Blame for the market disturbances has fallen on the growing complexity and speed of the nation’s 13 official stock exchanges — three of which are owned by the New York Stock Exchange — and dozens of less official platforms for trading. A decade ago there were only two major trading platforms, and transaction times were measured in seconds.A regulatory change in 2007 threw open the floodgates of competition by forcing stock trades to be routed to the exchange with the best price, as long as the exchange could act immediately. The proliferation of exchanges since then has lowered the price of trading for investors, and trade times are now measured in milliseconds. In the race for speed, however, some industry experts say reliability has been sacrificed.“The markets basically gutted their high-cost, nonstop infrastructures for very fast, low-cost infrastructures,” said Larry Tabb, the founder and chief executive of the Tabb Group.There is little public data available on how frequently market disturbances occur. The S.E.C. does not provide comprehensive numbers on them. Most of the information is publicized in nonstandardized form by the exchanges themselves.Nasdaq provides some of the most complete data on how often it has encountered breakdowns with other exchanges. When BATS’s trading platform began acting erratically on Friday, the other exchanges made such breakdown declarations against BATS.Exchanges began reporting these events only in 2007. Since then, the number of times Nasdaq has declared breakdowns at other exchanges — what market overseers call declarations of self-help — has risen each year, climbing from 96 times the first year to 139 times last year. These figures do not include the instances in which other exchanges reported problems with Nasdaq.“As you have more self-helps, you are going to have more people backing out of the market,” said Joseph Saluzzi, a founder of the brokerage firm Themis Trading and a critic of the current market structure.In some cases, these disruptions are caused by a bad network connection and are fixed quickly. But other times, trading in entire categories of stocks has been thrown off. Over the last five years, Nasdaq has called out problems with BATS 33 times, and with the New York Stock Exchange 109 times.A spokesman said the New York Stock Exchange had no comment on the figures.Joe Ratterman, BATS’s chief executive, said in an interview that Nasdaq had a reputation for declaring breakdowns against other exchanges “inappropriately,” and often when the problems were with Nasdaq’s own system.“We’re often frustrated because we find that the problem was on Nasdaq’s end,” Mr. Ratterman said.Even with disturbances happening, Mr. Ratterman added, today’s interconnected markets can repair themselves more quickly than in the past.“I totally get it that people are concerned,” he said, but he added that the ability of investors to trade “smoothly today is superior to what it’s been in the past.”The S.E.C. and other regulators have been examining the vulnerabilities of the market, and the impact of high-speed trading, since the flash crash in May 2010. A new committee for the Commodity Futures Trading Commission examining the issue was set to meet for the first time on Thursday.The S.E.C. has already taken several steps to head off moments of market chaos, including the circuit-breaker measures for 10 percent swings.The circuit breakers have also provided a new window into how often such extreme market moves happen. During periods of calm trading, like January of this year, circuit breakers were used infrequently: 14 times, according to data analyzed by Tabb. In contrast, they were used 51 times in December. The figures do not indicate how often the problems were because of the exchanges rather than other factors.Christopher Nagy, the head of order routing at the retail broker TD Ameritrade, compared circuit breakers to brakes on a car. They are important, he said, but they become less effective as the car goes faster, as the market has in recent years.“When you see any sort of market strife, you see chaos erupt,” he said.The S.E.C. is considering introducing other measures to monitor the markets, like a new system, known as limit up-limit down, to halt extreme trades before they can be executed.

"'12-03-29,'1','“By any standards, this is a big crisis,” said Kristalina Georgieva, European commissioner for humanitarian aid, who visited Congo this month. In a nation that covers as much territory as Western Europe, but whose mineral riches have long been siphoned off by armed gangs and corrupt officials, violence is a constant curse.A five-year conflict, which drew in several neighboring countries, officially ended in 2003 after claiming an estimated three to four million lives. Last December, the incumbent, Joseph Kabila, was declared the winner of the presidential election, which was criticized by international monitors. But his government’s writ in much of the country remains thin, or nonexistent.In the north, the Lord’s Resistance Army, the guerrilla force led by Joseph Kony, has continued to carry out attacks, terrorizing the population. Here in the east, people live in fear of any number of marauding guerrilla groups, despite the presence of a large United Nations peacekeeping operation. Some of these armed groups began as local defense forces, which then morphed into militias that plague the civilians they are supposedly protecting.The Angry Villagers took up arms last year when the Congolese Army withdrew from important locations in this area and others to reorganize and absorb thousands of former militia fighters in an effort to end lawlessness. Since then, bloodshed has increased.Mr. Sadiki Bantu, who describes himself as a commander, says he and his men formed ranks to combat the vicious guerrilla groups that have for years preyed on people in Congo’s dense rainforest, killing, looting and raping at will.He says his men have killed 50 enemy combatants — guerrillas of the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda, known by their French initials, F.D.L.R., which include remnants of the Hutu fighters who carried out the genocide in neighboring Rwanda in 1994 and who have since made a haven in Congo.Those who have fled violence by the F.D.L.R. guerrillas are not hard to find. A few minutes walk from Chulwe’s health center, Bulonza Mazuku, her husband and eight children arrived on foot on March 6. They had nothing but the clothes they wore, so quickly did they flee as the guerrillas looted their home and prepared to burn it.Down the road, the village of Nzibira is teeming with people like them. Nearly 1,200 families have sought shelter there, according to Malteser International, which provides health care. In all, more than 4,000 families have arrived in five nearby villages.The numbers have swelled as the guerrillas stepped up attacks in revenge for the actions of the Angry Villagers, who have also killed F.D.L.R. family members, according to Congolese military officials and relief workers.“There is a difficulty when there is a situation where Raia Mutomboki starts to target the F.D.L.R. and sometimes their families,” said Paulin Bishakabalya Kokere, an official with Malteser International. “It provokes vengeance and a vicious cycle of violence.”Faida Ombeni, 20, said she felt sure she was going to die last year in February when armed men — whom she believed to be F.D.L.R. guerrillas — found her hiding in a shack and beat her. Six attackers raped her, jamming a piece of clothing into her mouth to muffle her screaming, she said.After the attack, she became pregnant. Her husband abandoned her, presuming the baby was not his, she said. Then another round of F.D.L.R. attacks forced her to flee again, this time to Nzibira, where she sleeps on the floor of a home shared with about 30 others.Of 676 people who arrived in October and November at centers supported by the International Committee of the Red Cross, 506 said they had been raped, mostly in conflict-related cases.Though the Angry Villagers have just about 25 firearms and little ammunition, it has become among the most problematic of the 20 or so armed groups operating in the region, said Col. Delphin Kahimbi, commandant of the Congolese Army’s operations in South Kivu.Not only has it attacked F.D.L.R. guerrillas, but also those Congolese Army soldiers who speak Kinyarwanda, the official language of neighboring Rwanda. The group has killed fewer F.D.L.R. guerrillas than it claims — just two or three, Colonel Kahimbi says — but it has killed about 40 of their family members, attacks that generated a new cycle of retribution.“There is a tendency to reject the presence of all Rwandaphones,” Colonel Kahimbi said. “They are a problem, they are hostile to our army because of the presence of some Rwandaphones. We cannot give one, small community the chance to judge our army and impose their will.”He did not need any help from the self-defense militias to secure his area, he said, arguing that the Congolese Army, with logistical support from United Nations peacekeepers, was on course to eradicate the F.D.L.R. guerrillas within six months. Of 3,600 F.D.L.R. combatants in South Kivu, only around 600 remain active, he said, a claim the F.D.L.R. rejected as “propaganda.”Many local people are less confident in Colonel Kahimbi’s forces than he is. For Joseph Bupande Mumembwe, chief of the village of Luyuyu, where 30 people were killed in January, including one pregnant women whose stomach, he said, was cut open, the self-defense militias remain the only faint hope.“Raia Mutomboki is a good organization,” he said. “They want just to save people’s lives.”'"
"'12-03-29,'1','Lawyers for Dominique Strauss-Kahn, whom prosecutors accused of raping a hotel housekeeper before dropping charges against him last year, asked a judge on Wednesday to dismiss a civil lawsuit against their client, saying his former position as head of the International Monetary Fund bestowed “absolute immunity” upon him.Appearing in State Supreme Court in the Bronx, one of Mr. Strauss-Kahn’s lawyers, Amit P. Mehta, told Justice Douglas E. McKeon that “Mr. Strauss-Kahn enjoyed the same kind of diplomatic immunity” given the secretary general of the United Nations, a member of the Russian consulate or a Chinese diplomat.Mr. Strauss-Kahn’s lawyers said in court papers that his status as the head of an international organization with a special relationship with the United Nations protected him from lawsuits, even those based upon “acts done in the executive’s personal capacity.”But Douglas H. Wigdor, a lawyer for the housekeeper, Nafissatou Diallo, countered that immunity provisions in international law were meant not to protect individuals from wrongdoing, but only to allow diplomatic missions to function smoothly.Amid questions from the justice, Mr. Mehta contended that protections included in the Convention on the Privileges and Immunities of the Specialized Agencies, which was adopted by the United Nations General Assembly in 1947, should be extended to Mr. Strauss-Kahn, even though the United States did not sign that accord.'"
"'12-03-29,'1','“When you go to a game, the governing body can control drunken behavior. It can control someone standing up and blocking the view of others. It can control signage if it blocks the view of others. But most views expressed, even loud ones, are protected speech. No one has the right to insist that the game be watched in silence.”The debate, like most sports law arguments, is nuanced and complex. Classic public forum free-speech issues, for example, would generally not be applicable at privately owned facilities hosting games, like college basketball games at private universities. Privately owned teams can also contend that a fan’s purchase of a ticket is in fact a contract with the team to conform to a code of conduct, which could include a prohibition on excessive yelling at the officials. But many stadiums and arenas constructed with some public financing, or built on state land or land operated by a municipal authority, could be viewed as public entities. In that setting, a government cannot force citizens to surrender constitutional rights like free speech.There is some leeway, but where is the line drawn, and on which side does a fan yelling at a referee stand?“It is an interesting question, and we don’t have an exemplary test case that settles every aspect,” said Scott Rosner, a sports business and law professor at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School. “But traditionally, courts have come down on the side that free speech at a sporting event has limits. It is a right that is revocable — maybe because the few fans that come before courts have really overdone it.”Rosner, however, conceded that there could be cases that proved the opposite. He used as a hypothetical example a fan sitting at a Penn State football game and reading loudly from the grand jury report of the Jerry Sandusky sexual abuse case.“Everything about the setting is public,” Rosner said. “The fan is not doing anything wrong because he’s reading a public document, and yet it would likely agitate a lot of people in the crowd and conceivably lead security to remove the fan. And afterward, members of the A.C.L.U. would be lining up to represent that fan.”In fact, one fan, Robin Ficker, a Maryland lawyer, gained notice in the 1990s for similar demonstrations.Ficker was a fixture at Washington Bullets games, where he sat behind the opposing team’s bench and shouted at players, sometimes through a megaphone. He was careful about his language. He was not asked to leave. On at least one occasion, standing within feet of Michael Jordan, he read aloud unflattering passages from “The Jordan Rules,” a controversial book on the Chicago Bull’s first championship season.When the Bullets moved to a new arena, the team relocated Ficker, a season-ticket holder, behind the basket, and he declined to attend.John W. Adams, the N.C.A.A. national coordinator of men’s basketball officiating, said referees listen for taboo words from overzealous fans, comments that are racially or sexually oriented, obscene or threatening to anyone. In most cases, officials are instructed to deliver a warning, then to approach an N.C.A.A. staff member who is charged with handling the situation. But most other fan behavior is not an issue.“We have no book to go to at halftime that says, ‘This guy in the third row is standing and yelling for too long,’ ” Adams said. “We understand there’s going to be booing.”Asked about a situation in which a fan in the front row ceaselessly but not vulgarly yelled at a referee, Adams answered: “We would want our official to ignore that fan. If the guy has the energy to do it for 40 minutes, so be it.”Alan Goldberger, a lawyer from New Jersey and a former official who represents officiating organizations, said referees know when a fan has stepped over the line from rooting to interfering with their ability to administer the game.“It’s no different than shouting and cheering at a Broadway musical,” Goldberger said. “You can do it, but if you stand up and do it in the middle of a song, you are disrupting the performance. Your free speech doesn’t extend that far. It only goes so far.”But the legal precedents for those interpretations are hard to come by, perhaps for two contrasting reasons, lawyers said. Fans who might have good cases for seemingly unjust ejections are rarely arrested; they are only removed from the event. They may be upset afterward but not aggrieved enough to follow through with a lengthy lawsuit. The other reason is that when a fan does file a civil suit over an ejection, it is almost always settled before a trial because team owners and arena owners fear a landmark case establishing fans’ rights.“Imagine if a higher court took on such a case?” said Mark Conrad, an associate professor of sports law at Fordham University’s School of Business. “Facility owners would be quaking over anything like that because it could open the floodgates.”Policies regarding fan behavior at stadiums and arenas around the country are written with multiple situations in mind: indecent chants by student groups, singling out opposing players and, not insignificantly, intoxicated fans.“We put a lot of time into creating a code of conduct for fans with the input of several constituencies on campus,” said Mike Dowling, U.C.L.A.’s assistant athletic director in charge of operations. “But it is something you constantly wrestle with. You want a fun, exciting atmosphere, but you also want it safe and to exhibit good sportsmanship. Still, you know you’re going to deal with people who have a passion for what they’re watching or they wouldn’t be yelling or screaming.”Corchiani, whose wife and 11-year-old daughter accompanied him to North Carolina State’s Feb. 18 game, said he still had trouble believing he was ejected.“Yes, we questioned the ref’s calls, and we questioned the integrity of some of those calls,” Corchiani said. “We got under his skin. But if that warrants an ejection, then there wouldn’t be any fans allowed in any arenas.“When I’m getting Twitter messages from Tar Heel fans and Duke fans telling us we did nothing wrong, I know something weird happened.”'"
"'12-03-29,'1','Walter said: “It will be substantial.”It will have to be. To get the most money, the Dodgers will probably be the centerpiece of a regional sports channel that will funnel enormous annual rights fees to the team and amass monthly subscriber fees from the cable, satellite and telephone companies that will carry its games.A bevy of media companies are likely to line up to give the Dodgers the most lucrative deal, which could couple ownership of a channel with huge yearly rights payments. Time Warner Cable, for instance, is creating two networks, one in English, one in Spanish, with Johnson’s old team, the Los Angeles Lakers, at their core. The Lakers are expected to ultimately realize huge profits from the deal.“The marketplace continues to escalate for valuable sports rights and they’re in the second-biggest sports market with one of the biggest sports brands in the world,” Chris Bevilacqua, a sports media investor and adviser, said of the Dodgers. He added that the bidders for the TV deal with the Dodgers could include News Corporation, which now televises Dodgers games on Prime Ticket; Time Warner Cable; Microsoft; Apple; Google; Hulu and Netflix.But will the anticipated television windfall be enough to justify the $2.15 billion price?“It’s a ridiculous price that will take them years to recover,” said Marc Ganis, a sports-industry analyst. “Looking down the road, with a stadium naming-rights deal and a lot of cable money, you do sniff that number. Over time, five or 10 years, it might get to that value if they implement things properly.”McCourt was fortunate to sell the team when he did. He did not want to let go of the Dodgers initially and he staged a battle for control against Commissioner Bud Selig that reached its height when McCourt put the team into bankruptcy.But timing and circumstances helped McCourt fetch far more than the Cubs did in 2009.For one thing, the economy has improved. And the Ricketts family, which now owns the Cubs, could not look forward to a huge influx of new TV money when it bought the team and thus could not justify paying more than $845 million.Interestingly, the Johnson group is making the $2.15 billion purchase without adding any debt to the $412 million it is assuming from McCourt. In contrast, when McCourt bought the Dodgers in 2004, he financed the purchase entirely with borrowed money.In a statement on Wednesday, Selig did not cite McCourt, but did thank “the great Dodger fans for their loyalty and patience” as the ownership change played out. And Selig had to be pleased with the final sale price.“When he became commissioner,” said Rob Manfred, an executive vice president of Major League Baseball, “Bud Selig stated that he should be judged on asset values, and I think the purchase price of the Dodgers is an indication of the overall financial health of the industry.”The effect of the precedent-setting bid will be scrutinized for what it will mean to the values of other major league teams. Some sports bankers believe that the $2.15 billion paid for the Dodgers will boost what other big-market teams are worth and that the Yankees could now sell for well more than $3 billion.And with a new benchmark set, what would the Mets be worth if Fred Wilpon and Saul Katz sold their control of the franchise? It might be tempting for them to test the waters, considering the financial duress they have endured in recent years. They have just concluded the sale of 48 percent of the team to various investors for $240 million, with 25 percent of the money coming from family members.“If I’m Fred, I’m selling tomorrow before everyone finds out these numbers don’t work,” said one banker. But Wilpon, through all his troubles, has made it clear how much he wants ownership of the team to stay in his family and he is unlikely to easily let go, even if the team’s value will now be lifted by the Dodgers sale.Although the marquee names in the Dodgers’ purchase are Johnson and Stan Kasten, the former president of the Washington Nationals and Atlanta Braves, Guggenheim — an insurance, investment advisory and securities trading business — is the key partner in the sale. To finance the Dodgers purchase, it is using money from its companies, partners and clients, Walter said.Walter, Johnson and Kasten wanted the Dodgers badly enough to overcome McCourt’s resistance to selling the Dodger Stadium land, with its parking lots. They agreed to pay $150 million for a half-interest.And sometime Monday night, they raised their bid for the team by about $400 million, said two people briefed on the process but who were not authorized to speak publicly about it. The other two bidders expected a three-way auction to start Wednesday, run by Blackstone Advisory Partners, one of the Dodgers’ investment bankers. But the blowout bid by the Johnson group led McCourt to stop the process.He did not ask the others to match or exceed $2.15 billion.Now, the rebuilding of the Dodgers franchise will begin, assuming the deal gets bankruptcy court approval, which is expected by April 30. “I’ll be at the stadium daily,” Johnson said on the telephone Thursday, “making sure the outreach to the community is going well, making sure players who want to talk to me can talk to me.”He and Kasten will own minority shares in the team. “Fans know what I stand for,” Johnson added. “They’re getting a local owner who’s going to work to make the fan experience the greatest of their lives.”'"

He added, “Stacy will help us both externally in the marketplace as well as internally with our continuing large emerging pool of women who are really becoming leaders in KPMG.”Lewis, 27, said her career challenges were not so different from those women working in an office setting. “You look at professional sports, women are still playing for a lot less money than men,” she said. “We’re struggling to gain equal pay, and I know that’s an issue in the workplace.”She added: “It’s definitely hard to work up the corporate ladder. Just with my story and what I’ve been through, it provides a lot of inspiration for women.”The decision to go to college was a no-brainer, Lewis said.“I went to school not with the intention of playing professional golf,” she said. “I went with the intention of getting a degree to hopefully get a job down the road.” She added, “I wanted to get a degree that I could do something with if this whole golf thing didn’t work out.”The whole golf thing worked out well for Lewis last year; she made 22 of 23 cuts, had two runner-up finishes and 12 top-10 showings. It all started here, she said, when she came from behind to beat Yani Tseng, the most dominant golfer of either sex.“It gave me so much confidence that I could play against the best players in the world,” Lewis said. “You know, just to hang with Yani like I did for two days, I don’t think there’s many people that can say that they’ve done that.

In describing the stifling minutiae that had defined women’s lives for generations, both argued persuasively that women’s disenfranchisement at the hands of men must end.For Ms. Rich, the personal, the political and the poetical were indissolubly linked; her body of work can be read as a series of urgent dispatches from the front. While some critics called her poetry polemical, she remained celebrated for the unflagging intensity of her vision, and for the constant formal reinvention that kept her verse — often jagged and colloquial, sometimes purposefully shocking, always controlled in tone, diction and pacing — sounding like that of few other poets.All this helped ensure Ms. Rich’s continued relevance long after she burst genteelly onto the scene as a Radcliffe senior in the early 1950s.Her constellation of honors includes a “genius” grant in 1994 and a for poetry in 1974 for “ Into the Wreck.” That volume, published in 1973, is considered her masterwork.In the title poem, Ms. Rich uses the metaphor of a dive into dark, unfathomable waters to plumb the depths of women’s experience:I am here, the mermaid whose dark hair streams black, the merman in his armored body We circle silently about the wreck we dive into the hold. ... We are, I am, you are by cowardice or courage the one who find our way back to the scene carrying a knife, a camera a book of myths in which our names do not appear.Ms. Rich was far too seasoned a campaigner to think that verse alone could change entrenched social institutions. “Poetry is not a healing lotion, an emotional massage, a kind of linguistic aromatherapy,” she said in an acceptance speech to the National Book Foundation in 2006, on receiving its medal for distinguished contribution to American letters. “Neither is it a blueprint, nor an instruction manual, nor a billboard.”But at the same time, as she made resoundingly clear in interviews, in public lectures and in her work, Ms. Rich saw poetry as a keen-edged beacon by which women’s lives — and women’s consciousness — could be illuminated.She was never supposed to have turned out as she did.Adrienne Cecile Rich was born in on May 16, 1929. Her father, Arnold Rice Rich, a doctor and assimilated Jew, was an authority on tuberculosis who taught at . Her mother, Helen Gravely Jones Rich, a Christian, was a pianist and composer who, cleaving to social norms of the day, forsook her career to marry and have children. Adrienne was baptized and confirmed in the Episcopal Church.Theirs was a bookish household, and Adrienne, as she said afterward, was groomed by her father to be a literary prodigy. He encouraged her to write poetry when she was still a child, and she steeped herself in the poets in his library — all men, she later ruefully observed. But those men gave her the formalist grounding that let her make her mark when she was still very young.When Ms. Rich was in her last year at Radcliffe (she received a bachelor’s degree in English there in 1951), chose her first collection, “A Change of World,” for publication in the Younger Poets series, a signal honor. Released in 1951, the book, with its sober mien, dutiful meter and scrupulous rhymes, was praised by reviewers for its impeccable command of form.She had learned the lessons of her father’s library well, or so it seemed. For even in this volume Ms. Rich had begun, with subtle subversion, to push against a time-honored thematic constraint — the proscription on making poetry out of the soul-numbing dailiness of women’s lives.A poem in the collection, “Aunt Jennifer’s Tigers,” depicting a woman at her needlework and reprinted here in full, is concerned with precisely this:Aunt Jennifer’s tigers prance across a screen,Bright topaz denizens of a world of green.They do not fear the men beneath the tree;They pace in sleek chivalric certainty.Aunt Jennifer’s fingers fluttering through her woolFind even the ivory needle hard to pull.The massive weight of Uncle’s wedding bandSits heavily upon Aunt Jennifer’s hand.When Aunt is dead, her terrified hands will lieStill ringed with ordeals she was mastered by.The tigers in the panel that she madeWill go on prancing, proud and unafraid.Once mastered, poetry’s formalist rigors gave Ms. Rich something to rebel against, and by her third collection, “Snapshots of a Daughter-in-Law,” published by Harper & Row, she had pretty well exploded them. That volume appeared in 1963, a watershed moment in women’s letters: “The Feminine Mystique” was also published that year.In the collection’s title poem, Ms. Rich chronicles the pulverizing onus of traditional married life. It opens this way:You, once a belle in Shreveport,with henna-colored hair, skin like a peachbud,still have your dresses copied from that time. ...Your mind now, mouldering like wedding-cake,heavy with useless experience, richwith suspicion, rumor, fantasy,crumbling to pieces under the knife-edgeof mere fact.Though the book horrified some critics, it sealed Ms. Rich’s national reputation.She knew the strain of domestic duty firsthand. In 1953 Ms. Rich had married a economist, Alfred Haskell Conrad, and by the time she was 30 she was the mother of three small boys. When Professor Conrad took a job at the , the family moved to , where Ms. Rich became active in the civil rights and antiwar movements.By 1970, partly because she had begun, inwardly, to acknowledge her erotic love of women, Ms. Rich and her husband had grown estranged. That autumn, he died of a gunshot wound to the head; the death was ruled a suicide. To the end of her life, Ms. Rich rarely spoke of it.Ms. Rich effectively came out as a lesbian in 1976, with the publication of “Twenty-One Love Poems,” whose subject matter — sexual love between women — was still considered disarming and dangerous. In the years that followed her poetry and prose ranged over her increasing self-identification as a Jewish woman, the Holocaust and the struggles of black women.Ms. Rich’s other volumes of poetry include “The Dream of a Common Language” (1978), “A Wild Patience Has Taken Me This Far” (1981), “The Fact of a Doorframe” (1984), “An Atlas of the Difficult World” (1991) and, most recently, “Tonight No Poetry Will Serve,” published last year.Her prose includes the essay collections “On Lies, Secrets, and Silence” (1979); “Blood, Bread, and Poetry” (1986); an influential essay, “Compulsory Heterosexuality and Lesbian Existence,” published as a slender volume in 1981; and the nonfiction book “Of Woman Born” (1976), which examines the institution of motherhood as a socio-historic construct.For Ms. Rich, the getting of literary awards was itself a political act to be reckoned with. On sharing the National Book Award for poetry in 1974 (the other recipient that year was ), she declined to accept it on her own behalf. Instead, she appeared onstage with two of that year’s finalists, the poets Audre Lorde and ; the three of them accepted the award on behalf of all women.In 1997, in a widely reported act, Ms. Rich declined the National Medal of Arts, the government’s highest award bestowed upon artists. In a letter to , then chairwoman of the , which administers the award, she expressed her dismay, amid the “increasingly brutal impact of racial and economic injustice,” that the government had chosen to honor “a few token artists while the people at large are so dishonored.”, Ms. Rich added, “means nothing if it simply decorates the dinner table of power which holds it hostage.”Ms. Rich’s other laurels — and these she did accept — include the Bollingen Prize for Poetry, the Academy of American Poets Fellowship and the Ruth Lilly Poetry Prize.She taught widely, including at Columbia, Brandeis, Rutgers, and Stanford Universities.Ms. Rich’s survivors include her partner of more than 30 years, the writer Michelle Cliff; three sons, David, Pablo and Jacob, from her marriage to Professor Conrad; a sister, Cynthia Rich; and two grandchildren.For all her verbal prowess, for all her prolific output, Ms. Rich retained a dexterous command of the plain, pithy utterance. In a 1984 speech she summed up her reason for writing — and, by loud unspoken implication, her reason for being — in just seven words.What she and her sisters-in-arms were fighting to achieve, she said, was simply this: “the creation of a society without domination.”'"
"'12-03-29,'1','Like Twinkies — whose poor nutritional value ended up as a legal defense in the 1978 murders of the supervisor Harvey Milk and Mayor George Moscone, and Flavor Aid, the powdered drink that the cult leader Jim Jones laced with cyanide to kill more than 900 people in that same year — Skittles has now entered the elite world of food products that have become symbols through no fault of their own.For its part, Wrigley has chosen to make only a subdued statement about its product, saying the company is deeply saddened, respects the family’s privacy and feels “it inappropriate to get involved or comment further as we would never wish for our actions to be perceived as an attempt of commercial gain following this tragedy.”A spokeswoman, Jennifer Jackson Luth, would not comment on the impact of Skittles’s sudden popularity on profits.Skittles was already an immensely successful product. The chewy fruit-flavored pellets began as a British import in 1979 and are now the most popular candy among teenagers and younger children, second only to Starburst in overall sales of chewy candy. But with a new level of popularity come problems.“There is this moment where as a brand manager you think, ‘Oh my God, this is bigger than we are,’ ” said Heidi Hovland, a senior partner at Fleishman-Hillard in New York whose client list includes , and several food companies.On social media sites like , people are suggesting that Wrigley is profiting greatly from the tragedy and should donate money made since Trayvon’s death to the family or causes that would help with racial reconciliation or underprivileged communities. Some African-Americans are even asking people to stop buying Skittles until the company gets more involved in the case and donates money.“I think we are at a dangerous position where we can make Wrigley richer,” said Rashad Moore, 22, president of the chapel assistants at Morehouse College.Weldon McWilliams, a professor of African-American studies at Cheyney University of Pennsylvania, said Wrigley should invest in communities where “murder based on stereotypes is a reoccurring theme.”If they do not, African-Americans should not be promoting the product, Dr. McWilliams said. “I completely understand the symbolism, but let’s re-examine what we’re doing,” he said. “Will Wrigley’s reinvest that rise in profit that they see? I’m highly skeptical of that.”For Deanna Smith, a retired teacher who brought her 12-year-old granddaughter to a march for the Martin family in Atlanta this week, it is merely about standing up against racism. She also brought a big bag of Skittles. She does not mind that the company is making money from her purchase. The cause is more important.“He was so innocent,” she said. “Just getting candy from the store.”And after the march, they ate the Skittles.“There was no reason to let candy go to waste,” she said.Crisis management and public relations experts who are watching the Skittles situation unfold say the company has taken the right initial stance.“Wrigley’s is playing it exactly as I expect they would — they make a quiet statement and just sit back and let this thing unfold,” said Amy Stern, vice president of Bender Hammerling Group, a public relations company that does work with several large food companies.“The fact is, this is bringing their brand name to the forefront,” she said. “It’s becoming its own social media campaign, and that’s a windfall for the company. But you have to step carefully. This could backfire.”It is too soon for Wrigley to decide if it will use money from its foundation to support causes linked to Trayvon’s death, said Stephanie Childs, a former crisis manager for who helped the company through the salmonella contamination of its Peter Pan peanut butter brand and has also worked with its charitable foundation.“Any time you are dealing with a legal case, it adds a level of complexity that is a challenge to work with, especially when you are indirectly involved,” she said.She and others say the company will take a hit no matter how it handles the situation. If it donates money, people will criticize it for being not enough. If it speaks publicly, people will say they are capitalizing on it. And it will all be played out so much faster because of social media.How well Skittles will fare is uncertain, but Ms. Hovland and others believe the impact on the brand will be short-lived. “When cooler heads prevail,” she said, “people will recognize that this was a candy that was in the wrong place at the wrong time.”With its air of innocence and its slogan — “Taste the rainbow” — Skittles seemed a perfect symbol to help define the story, but it now is at risk of turning into something else.“It’s gone so quickly from the symbol of innocence and tragedy to one of ‘now that they are making all this money, what are they going to do with it?’ ” Ms. Hovland said. “It’s amazing how short the arc has become.”'"
"'12-03-29,'1','“As soon as I started reading the dispatches my stomach started churning,” Mr. Gruber said of the arguments on Tuesday, while taking a break from quizzing his son for a biology test. “Losing the mandate means continuing with our unfair individual insurance markets in a world where employer-based insurance is rapidly disappearing.”Mr. Gruber, 46, hates traveling without his wife and three children, so he is tracking the case from his home in Lexington, Mass. There he crunches numbers and advises other states on health care, in between headbanging at concerts with his 15-year-old son and cuddling with the family’s eight parrots. (His wife, Andrea, volunteers at a rescue center.)If the court rules against the mandate, Mr. Gruber says he believes the number of newly insured Americans could fall to eight million from the projected 32 million. He insists that without a mandate, the law will result in a terrible spiral: only relatively sick Americans will choose to get insurance, leading premium prices to rise and causing the healthier of even those sick people to drop their insurance, sending prices higher and higher.Some other economists quibble, though, with Mr. Gruber’s pessimistic assessment.“My general thought about the mandate is if insurance is affordable and accessible, most people will buy it anyway,” said David Cutler, an economist at and longtime collaborator of Mr. Gruber’s.Others, like Paul Starr, a sociologist, say they believe Mr. Gruber’s work does not account for how hard it will be to enforce the mandate.“There is this groupthink about how important the mandate is,” Mr. Starr says. “Most people don’t understand or won’t acknowledge how weak the enforcement mechanism is.”Mr. Starr said he thought Mr. Gruber in particular was overstating the effectiveness of the mandate because “it’s his baby.”That said, it is difficult for too many other experts to categorically refute Mr. Gruber’s work, since he has nearly cornered the market on the technical science behind these sorts of predictions. Other models exist — built by nonprofits like the RAND Corporation or private consultancies like the Lewin Group — but they all use Mr. Gruber’s work as a benchmark, according to Jean Abraham, a health economist at the and former senior economist in both the Obama and administrations.“He’s brought a level of science to an issue that would otherwise be just opinion,” Mr. Cutler says. “He’s really the only person who has been doing all this careful modeling for so long. He’s the only person you can go to for that kind of thing, which is why the White House reached out to him in the first place.”Mr. Obama had made health care reform a cornerstone of his campaign, and wanted to announce a credible proposal quickly after taking office. But members of the Obama administration’s transition team said they had inherited an executive branch that had vastly underinvested in modeling research on health care, especially compared to the technical modeling that had been done in areas like policy.“Creating a good model from scratch would have taken months, maybe years,” said , who was the director of President Obama’s National Economic Council and had advised Mr. Gruber on his dissertation when they were at Harvard.Mr. Gruber had already spent years researching government mandates, starting with his 1991 dissertation about how mandated employer benefits cut into workers’ wages.He also did similar analyses, on a broader range of public policies for the in the Clinton administration from 1997-98. He was recruited by Mr. Summers, who was then deputy secretary of Treasury.Then in 2001, after returning to M.I.T., Mr. Gruber received an e-mail from Amy Lischko, who was then an assistant commissioner in the Massachusetts healthy policy department under then-Gov. Jane M. Swift, a Republican.She was familiar with his work, and contracted him to model some potential ways that Massachusetts could expand health insurance coverage.“He certainly wasn’t as well known then as he is now in the health care arena,” said Ms. Lischko, now a professor at School of Medicine. “We couldn’t exactly kick the tires on these kinds of models back then, but we knew he had done work on simulations before.”Mr. Gruber calls himself a “card-carrying Democrat.” He and his wife host a “great quadrennial Democratic victory party” whether or not the Democratic candidate wins, he said. But given his reputation and relatively rare expertise, he still ended up working for two Republican governors in Massachusetts.When Mr. Romney succeeded Ms. Swift in 2003, he proposed using an individual mandate to help the state achieve universal health care coverage. Mr. Gruber was again brought in to analyze the idea, which he had not formally modeled before.“Romney saw it as a traditional Republican moral issue of personal responsibility, getting rid of the free riders in the system, not as much of an economic issue,” Mr. Gruber said. “Not only were the Republicans for it, the liberals hated it. People forget that.”Mr. Obama had vehemently opposed an individual mandate before his election in 2008.After the Massachusetts plan passed in 2006, , then the Republican governor of California, invited Mr. Gruber to to help model a similar proposal.“That was awesome,” Mr. Gruber says, his eyes widening at the memory. “I got to see the sword from Conan the Barbarian.”The California proposal fell apart, but soon Mr. Gruber had a little cottage industry helping states model potential health system changes. He also serves on the Massachusetts board that oversees the state’s new health care exchanges.Along with these credentials, Mr. Gruber’s position as an adviser to the influential also left him perfectly positioned to advise the White House on health reform.“The most important arbiter of everything was the C.B.O.,” said Neera Tanden, who was a senior adviser for health reform at the .The C.B.O.’s assessment of a bill’s efficacy and costs strongly influences political debate, but the office does not publicly reveal how it calculates those numbers.“We knew the numbers he gave us would be close to where the C.B.O. was likely to come out,” Ms. Tanden said. She was right.After Mr. Gruber helped the administration put together the basic principles of the proposal, the White House lent him to Capitol Hill to help Congressional staff members draft the specifics of the legislation.This assignment primarily involved asking his graduate student researchers to tweak his model’s software code. It was also almost entirely conducted from his home office, while his children were at school and then after they had gone to bed.“If I wanted to be in , I’d have taken a job in Washington,” he said. “I wanted to be around for my family.”Even though he was brought in by the White House, Congressional staff members from both parties trusted him because he was seen as an econometric wonk, not a political agent. But soon his very involvement with the bill caused questions about his objectivity to be raised in the news media.During and after the bill’s slog through Congress, he frequently spoke with reporters and wrote opinion pieces supporting the Affordable Care Act but did not always mention his role in helping to devise it.He says he regrets not being more upfront about his involvement with the administration. But he does not apologize for publicly advocating the legislation, and continuing to do so — including through a comic book he wrote to explain the law.“Yes, I want the public to be informed by an objective expert,” he says. “But the thing is, I know more about this law than any other economist.”'"
"'12-03-29,'1','BEIJING — Gao Zhisheng, the Chinese human rights lawyer whose whereabouts and well-being have been something of a mystery for the past two years, is alive and in good health, according to relatives who visited him in prison last weekend.On Wednesday, Mr. Gao’s wife, Geng He, said her father and Mr. Gao’s brother had been allowed a half-hour visit with him at a prison in the far western region of Xinjiang.“He was very pale, like someone who hasn’t been in the sunlight for years, but otherwise he seemed healthy,” Ms. Geng said, speaking from California, where she lives in exile with the couple’s two children. “After hearing the news from my family, I slept well for the first time in a long while.”A widely known dissident here, Mr. Gao, 47, was a celebrated lawyer until he ran afoul of the government by taking on politically delicate cases and exposing shortcomings in the legal system. His clients included victims of medical malpractice and farmers who had lost their land to development, but also persecuted Christians and adherents of Falun Gong, the outlawed spiritual movement. In 2005, he renounced his Communist Party membership and scathingly criticized the government in letters he sent to Chinese leaders.He was stripped of his law license and taken into custody a year later, in the first of several detentions. He was convicted of inciting subversion of state power. Released on probation, he was largely kept under house arrest, and his family was subjected to constant surveillance. During interrogations, he said, he had been pistol-whipped, prodded with electric batons and lanced with bamboo sticks.In 2009, his wife and children made a dramatic overland escape from Beijing to Thailand with the help of a Christian organization. They were later granted asylum in the United States.'"
"'12-03-29,'1','“Free market is not always the same as pro-business,” said Barney Keller, spokesman for the conservative political action committee .There could be real-world consequences to the conservative rebellion. The 90-day extension of the highway trust fund that House Republican leaders say they will pass this week in lieu of a broad highway bill would keep existing projects moving for now. But business groups say few new government-funded infrastructure projects can get under way without longer-range certainty about federal backing.“The majority of the work is supposed to go out in spring and get done by the fall,” said Jeff Shoaf, senior executive director of government affairs at the Associated General Contractors, a group that donated $1 million to candidates in 2010, 80 percent of that to Republicans. “Instead of spending 60 or 70 percent of their budgets, they’re going to cut back to 50 or 40 percent to make sure they have some cash in the fall.”Exports have been one of the bright spots of the fragile recovery, but without Export-Import Bank financing, companies could struggle to complete contracts with overseas buyers. Those buyers will most likely turn to foreign competitors whose governments have more robust versions of the bank, businesspeople say.“There’s not a bank in the that’s going to money to that customer of mine in to buy my airplane,” said David Ickert, vice president of finance at Air Tractor, which makes crop-dusting and firefighting airplanes in Olney, Tex. “There is not a free-market system that operates like that. It does not exist. We need the Ex-Im Bank, period.”Like so much else in Congress these days, it is not that simple.With its charter set to expire in May, the bank is the target of conservative groups. They are making the case to Republicans that the bank, created in 1934 to finance sales to the Soviet Union, has no place in a free-market system. Club for Growth is holding it up as the next or , crowding out private lending and offering dangerous loans that ultimately could be left in the laps of the taxpayer.“Those groups are just wrong, period,” said Jay Timmons, president of the and a generous personal contributor to Republican candidates.The bank is financed with a small percentage of each loan it makes to foreign buyers of American exports, producing $3.4 billion in profits for the federal government over the last five years.Drew Greenblatt, president and owner of Marlin Steel Wire Products, in , said he recently got a rush order for wire baskets from a firm in , assuming he could finance the sale. He went to the Export-Import Bank and paid a one-half-percent fee on the loan. The bank guaranteed 95 percent of the loan. He kept the plant working through the weekend and completed the sale.“Think about all the winners in this transaction,” he said. “Ex-Im got half a point. Baltimore City steelworkers got extra hours. I got extra profits to meet payroll, and hopefully I got a client who will reorder from me.”If anything, the anger over the stalled transportation bill is even more acute, business lobbyists say. The Senate, in a bipartisan vote, has passed a surface transportation bill that would keep money flowing for two years. The House, however, appears stuck.Republican leaders first tried a five-year bill that would be financed in part by opening land to drilling. But division over the drilling provisions and its scant funding for mass transit brought opposition from moderate Republicans, while conservatives objected to the amount of federal largess in the bill. Business lobbyists, contractors and local government officials from both parties have pressed the House to move forward, so far to no avail., president of the Business Roundtable, which represents the chief executives of major American corporations, said in an era of scarcity, anything that cost money was receiving a high level of scrutiny. And the highway bill is more contentious than those in the past. Previous bills have been financed mainly by the federal , but rising is depleting gas tax receipts as infrastructure needs increase.Difficulty is no excuse, said Mr. Engler, a former Republican governor of . “We’re letting people say it’s hard and so we won’t go forward,” he said. “That is what the business community cannot understand.”To conservative groups, fresh eyes on issues have produced fresh, small-government thinking. The Export-Import Bank, for instance, wanted a new, long-term authorization with an expanded loan limit and broader authority. Instead, Representative of is drafting a 13-month reauthorization that would demand the Obama administration begin international talks to phase out export-lending subsidies globally, force the bank to be more transparent in its lending practices and rein in its loan portfolio.Some Republicans are growing worried about the ramifications of these fights. Senator , Republican of , has pressed to reauthorize the Export-Import Bank, but at the insistence of Senator of , the Republican leader, he joined his party in opposing Democratic efforts to add reauthorization to a small-business finance bill. Now Mr. Graham says his party has to find a way to move a stand-alone bill, and fast.“Come June, if this program dies, it will be the end of job creation for thousands of businesses for no good reason,” he said. “And it’ll happen on our watch, with our fingerprints on it.”'"
"'12-03-29,'1','LONDON — After the risk of explosion forced the evacuation of a leaking offshore platform in the North Sea, the French oil company Total said Wednesday that the situation was “stable” but that it was still examining how to stop the gas leak.Gas continued to escape from the Elgin platform, off the coast of Scotland, for a fourth day, while well-control experts in Aberdeen debated options on how to halt the leak, including killing the well with heavy liquids and creating a relief well, which could take up to six months.There was still some concern that a flare that has been burning near the leak since the well was depressurized on Sunday could cause an explosion. But Total played down the concerns and said wind is moving the gas cloud away from the flare and is expected to continue to do so. A flare is part of the normal procedure of depressurizing a well and usually stops on its own once the total degassing occurs, a spokesman for Total said.“The gas leak at the Elgin wellhead platform remains ongoing although the situation is currently stable,” Total said in a written update. “We continue to take all possible measures to confirm the source and cause of the leak and bring it under control.”Gas started to leak at the platform, about 150 miles east of Aberdeen, over the weekend after workers were in the process of capping and abandoning the well. No one on the platform was injured, but as a precaution Total evacuated all 238 workers. On Wednesday, two fire vessels and a remotely operated vehicle were on standby just outside a 2-nautical-mile no-go zone around the platform that was set up for safety reasons.John Shanks, an industry consultant at RiserTec in Aberdeen, told Reuters that “if gas continues to leak at a steady or increased rate over a sustained period of time, the platform could become an explosion waiting to happen.”Any effort to stop the leak could be made more difficult by the choppy waters of the North Sea. In a sign that some investors were concerned about the impact of the leak on Total, shares in the company fell 1.4 percent in Paris on Wednesday. Shares of other oil companies, including Eni of Italy and Royal Dutch Shell, also declined.'"
"'12-03-29,'1','“I kind of know what he’s going through on the level of the discomfort,” Richardson said before the game. “Some days you feel good, and some days you don’t. Tough to ride in cars and stuff like that. It’s good that it’s just bulging and it’s not herniated.”Dr. Andrew Hecht, chief of spinal surgery at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine, clarified the difference between a bulging disk and a herniated disk, equating a bulging disk with jelly pushing against the wall of a donut and a herniated disk with jelly coming out of the donut.Hecht said Stoudemire’s treatment plan, which includes an epidural, a steroid injection to reduce inflammation around the nerves where the disk is, was the common, conservative approach.“This is where we start with a lot of athletes,” Hecht said.“Most people get better without surgery,” he added.Hecht said a bulging disk was the most common spinal problem in elite athletes.“Almost the overwhelming majority of the time they get better with conservative care,” he said.Hecht, who advises the Jets and the Islanders, emphasized that he could speak in only a universal way because he had not treated Stoudemire or seen the results of his magnetic resonance imaging exam.Once the pain subsides and the inflammation goes down, Stoudemire is expected to be able to increase the intensity of his rehabilitation process. Indeed, his recovery is dependent more on the reduction of pain than anatomical change in the bulging disk. The disk can become less swollen, but many people live every day without the knowledge that they have herniated or bulging disks, Hecht said.Before the game, Knicks Coach Mike Woodson said: “I don’t have any information I can give you right now on Amar’e. I really don’t.”Woodson said he hoped the Knicks could get Stoudemire back early enough so they would not have to search for chemistry on the fly as the playoffs approached.“But right now,” he said, “first things first is getting him back healthy and us taking each game at a time with the guys that are in uniform, pushing them to play at a high level to help us win. Because that’s all we can do at this point.”Richardson said: “You know, you got a sprained ankle, you can kind of play through that and it’s cool and it’s not that big a deal. But your back, it’s more delicate. It’s central to everything.”'"
"'12-03-29,'1','Analysts said several factors were likely to have depressed trading Wednesday. Mr. Paulsen said one catalyst was probably the decline in oil prices.Crude prices fell after news agency reports that the United States might release some of its strategic oil stocks and that it was in talks with France and Britain about the possible step, aimed at pushing down oil prices.In addition, the Energy Information Administration reported that United States crude inventories posted their largest weekly climb since July 2010.The decline in crude oil also brought down gold prices, analysts said. Crude oil for May delivery fell $1.92 to $105.41 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Gold spot prices were down by more than 1 percent to $1,662 an ounce.For the day, the S.& P. 500 lost 6.98 points to 1,405.54, while the Dow dropped 71.52 points to 13,126.21. The Nasdaq shed 15.39 points to 3,104.96.Still, the S.& P. 500, a broad measure of the market, is up more than 11 percent this year, while the Dow industrials are ahead more than 7 percent. The Nasdaq is up more than 19 percent, mostly helped by Apple.But with first-quarter earnings reports ready to come out in April, and mixed economic data continuing to trickle out, investors are slightly on edge.“You can sense the climate changing,” Mr. Paulsen said. “We are facing earnings season right around the corner. Any catalyst today could have done this.”Among other factors that weighed on commodity prices was a Goldman Sachs report that the economic environment for the second quarter was likely to soften for commodities, although tension in the Middle East could change that.And signs emerged of a slowdown in private sector lending in Europe, analysts said. The European Central Bank said Wednesday that the growth of such loans had slowed to an annual rate of 1.1 percent from 1.5 percent in January, raising issues of liquidity, other analysts said.The Commerce Department reported that that orders for durable goods rose 2.2 percent in February. The report suggested good news for manufacturing, but the gain was below analysts’ forecasts of 3 percent.“Over all, the numbers weighed on sentiment as they indicated that the economic recovery may not be as strong as initially anticipated,” said Eric Viloria, senior currency strategist for FOREX.com.Energy and materials shares were down 1.4 percent and 1.7 percent respectively. Financial stocks declined slightly. Exxon Mobil was down 0.88 percent at $85.86, and Halliburton was down more than 1 percent at $32.48. Materials shares fell the hardest. Freeport McMoran Copper was down 3.59 percent at $37.36. Alcoa dropped 2.29 percent to $9.83 and United States Steel was down 1.77 percent at $28.81.The trading day on Wall Street started out on a negative note passed on by overseas markets. European markets were lower, with the DAX index in Frankfurt and the CAC 40 in Paris both down 1.1 percent.Rick Bensignor, the chief market strategist for Merlin Securities, said, “When you see oil starts the day down strongly, it is no surprise to see gold get knocked down along with other commodities.”Mr. Bensignor said, however, that the modest decline in the indexes at the close of trading belied what had at times been a volatile session of profit-taking. For example the VIX, or the CBOE volatility index, an indicator of future volatility, spiked about 6 percent during the session, before falling back to 15.47, not far from its 52-week low of 13.66.“People took today’s negative news along with some technical resistance that has been showing up in the market to do a little trimming, and that steamrolled a bit during the day,” Mr. Bensignor said. In the bond market, the price of the 10-year Treasury fell 4/32, to 98 7/32, pushing its yield up to 2.20 percent, from 2.19 percent late Tuesday.'"
"'12-03-29,'1','In 2005, Tenzin Tsundue, a Tibetan writer and prominent advocate of Tibetan independence, climbed a building in and unfurled a banner during a visit by Prime Minister of China. Mr. Tsundue was arrested Tuesday night while participating at a forum held at the India Habitat Centre, one of the city’s premier cultural venues. One of four speakers participating in a discussion organized by the Tibetan Women’s Association, Mr. Tsundue praised India and warned of an impending Chinese collapse.“India gives us our strength, our confidence — India is our guru,” he said, according to a statement released by the association, which then detailed how he was suddenly detained during a tea break. About 10 police officers appeared, shoved away organizers who tried to intervene, the statement said, and “Tsundue was dragged to his feet and forced out the back door.”Rajan Bhagat, a spokesman for the New Delhi police, said that Mr. Tsundue was being held in preventive custody. “He has a history of creating nuisances,” Mr. Bhagat said. “That’s why preventative security measures were taken.”Meanwhile, in the Tibetan neighborhood known as Majnu ka Tila, many Tibetans found themselves living under de facto house arrest. Shops were closed as paramilitary officers wielding metal nightsticks and machine guns patrolled the sidewalks. Police officers sat in the shade or strolled through the alleyways.“What can we do?” asked Sonam Thoghal, 43, the owner of a small clothing shop. “We are just refugees. We are very upset about it. But we have to go by the law. The police are walking through all the lanes here. If they see four or five people gathering together, they say they will take them to the police station if they do not split up.”Mr. Yeshi, the Tibetan protester who died Wednesday morning, had lived in this neighborhood. He was among the hundreds of Tibetans who rode buses to the center of the city to participate in a march to protest Mr. Hu’s visit to India.When the procession reached , an 18th-century astronomical complex that has become a famous protest site, Mr. Yeshi set himself on fire. Startling photographs of him running, engulfed in flames, quickly circled around the world.Kelsang Dolma, one of the protesters, had sat beside Mr. Yeshi on the bus, with her infant son. “He said, ‘You are very strong because you are carrying a little boy,’ ” she recalled.On Wednesday afternoon, people outside a Buddhist monastery in the Tibetan neighborhood lit candles in memory of the Tibetans who have died lighting themselves on fire and are regarded as martyrs.Some people crowded around a photocopy of a letter handwritten in Tibetan and discovered in the Mr. Yeshi’s room.“The fact that Tibetan people are setting themselves on fire in this 21st century is to let the world know about their suffering, and to tell the world about the denial of basic human rights,” the letter said, according to a translation.By midafternoon, a montage of the newest martyr joined the photographs of other “martyrs”: a smiling Mr. Yeshi surrounded by images of him in flames.In a Tibetan region of western China on Wednesday, a monk from the embattled Kirti Monastery in the town of Ngaba, known in Chinese as Aba, died by self-immolation, according to monks at Kirti’s sister monastery in Dharamsala, the Indian town that is home to the Dalai Lama and the Tibetan exile government.At least 30 people in Tibetan areas of China have self-immolated since March 2011.'"
"'12-03-29,'1','By Tuesday afternoon, posters of the man in flames were plastered along the narrow streets of this town adopted by Tibetan exiles. Monks, merchants and tourists stared. In the early evening, more than 200 people walked through the town center waving Tibetan flags and carrying banners that proclaimed Jamphel Yeshi, who died on Wednesday, a martyr.The shocking images of Mr. Yeshi’s self-immolation in on Monday have provided the Tibetan exile movement with a rallying point and an iconic expression of the anger and frustration that Tibetans suffer over Chinese rule. At least 29 Tibetans have set themselves on fire in Tibetan areas of since March 2011, and many have died. But Chinese security forces have clamped down across the plateau, so only a handful of the self-immolations have been recorded and transmitted, and only in grainy cellphone photographs or video.Mr. Yeshi burned himself in front of hundreds of people, during a protest largely by Tibetans before a visit by President Hu Jintao of China, who was scheduled to arrive in New Delhi Wednesday afternoon to attend an economic summit. Mr. Yeshi was taken to a hospital with burns over 98 percent of his body, and word of the self-immolation spread quickly through Dharamsala, a hill station in northern India that is the home of the , the spiritual leader of the Tibetans, and the government-in-exile.On Tuesday, images of Mr. Yeshi proliferated on walls here. One gruesome poster showed his ravaged body in the hospital. A cousin, Sonam Wangyal, visited him before his death and mourned his terrible injuries, The Associated Press reported. But he also said: “We are fighting for freedom. The world should know this.”Details about Mr. Yeshi’s life emerged. Many initial reports that were largely based on Indian police accounts said his first name was Jampa and gave his age as 26, but Tibetan organizations here said with certainty that he was Jamphel Yeshi, 27. Fellow exiles said he was from the Ganzi area in the eastern Tibetan region of Kham, which now lies in China’s Sichuan Province. He left in 2006 and made his way to Dharamsala, where he attended a school that educates refugees in Tibetan history, culture and language. Mr. Yeshi then settled in New Delhi, where he was unemployed and lived with his cousin.“He self-immolated for the cause of Tibet,” said Tenzing Namdak, 36, a man in jeans and a tan jacket walking at the back of the march on Tuesday. “All the Tibetans have tried so many ways to get attention, and somebody had to take the lead.”'"
"'12-03-29,'1','News Limited, the Australian arm of News Corporation, said the Australian Financial Review article was “full of factual inaccuracies.”Late Wednesday evening, Chase Carey, News Corporation’s president and chief operating officer, said in a statement that the claims made in the BBC1 program “Panorama” used “manipulated and mischaracterized e-mails to produce unfair and baseless accusations.”He added, “News Corporation is proud to have worked with NDS and to have supported them in their aggressive fight against piracy and copyright infringement.”Given the heightened pressure that News Corporation faces over phone hacking at its British tabloids, any new accusations of hacking-related wrongdoing could worsen the company’s problems.Tom Watson, a member of Parliament who has championed investigations into News Corporation’s British newspapers, said he would refer the accusations against NDS to Ofcom, the British regulatory body investigating whether News Corporation passes the country’s “fit and proper” test to operate a broadcaster.Suzie Brady, a spokeswoman for Australia’s communications minister, Stephen Conroy, said in an e-mail, “These are serious allegations, and any allegations of criminal activity should be referred to the Australian federal police for investigation.”The accusations come days after Cisco Systems said it planned to buy the NDS Group for approximately $5 billion. The private equity firm Permira owns 51 percent and News Corporation owns 49 percent.“Recent media allegations date back over 10 years and predate Cisco’s involvement with NDS,” a Cisco spokesman, Jim Brady, said in a statement. He declined to comment further.News Corporation first invested in NDS in 1988 when the company was a small Israeli start-up operated by several former soldiers. In 1992, News Corporation paid $15 million for NDS to provide encryption services for its satellite-television business. Today, NDS’s largest clients are BSkyB in Britain, of which News Corporation owns 39.1 percent, and DirecTV in the United States.In the past, NDS’s main satellite TV competitors in Britain and the United States have leveled charges against the company. In a lawsuit filed in 2002 in Federal District Court in New York, Vivendi Universal’s Canal Plus Group accused NDS of corporate espionage and conspiracy. DirecTV also sued DNS on grounds of fraud and misappropriation of trade secrets. Vivendi and DirecTV later withdrew the lawsuits.In January, the United States Supreme Court ruled in favor of NDS and awarded the company $19 million in damages after a protracted battle with the EchoStar Communications Group. In a 2003 lawsuit, EchoStar (now Dish) accused NDS of hacking into its satellite service.Those types of disputes were common in the satellite TV industry in its early days. “They all accused each other of hacking into each other and spreading it on the Internet,” said Bob Scherman, editor and publisher of Satellite Business News, an independent trade publication. “They all hired satellite hackers and called them ‘consultants.’ ”“These allegations — most of which are 10 or more years old — were the subject of a long-running court case in the United States that concluded with NDS being totally vindicated of all allegations of piracy,” the company said.'"

"'12-03-29,'1','LONDON — After the risk of explosion forced the evacuation of a leaking offshore platform in the North Sea, the French oil company Total said Wednesday that the situation was “stable” but that it was still examining how to stop the gas leak.Gas continued to escape from the Elgin platform, off the coast of Scotland, for a fourth day, while well-control experts in Aberdeen debated options on how to halt the leak, including killing the well with heavy liquids and creating a relief well, which could take up to six months.There was still some concern that a flare that has been burning near the leak since the well was depressurized on Sunday could cause an explosion. But Total played down the concerns and said wind is moving the gas cloud away from the flare and is expected to continue to do so. A flare is part of the normal procedure of depressurizing a well and usually stops on its own once the total degassing occurs, a spokesman for Total said.“The gas leak at the Elgin wellhead platform remains ongoing although the situation is currently stable,” Total said in a written update. “We continue to take all possible measures to confirm the source and cause of the leak and bring it under control.”Gas started to leak at the platform, about 150 miles east of Aberdeen, over the weekend after workers were in the process of capping and abandoning the well. No one on the platform was injured, but as a precaution Total evacuated all 238 workers. On Wednesday, two fire vessels and a remotely operated vehicle were on standby just outside a 2-nautical-mile no-go zone around the platform that was set up for safety reasons.John Shanks, an industry consultant at RiserTec in Aberdeen, told Reuters that “if gas continues to leak at a steady or increased rate over a sustained period of time, the platform could become an explosion waiting to happen.”Any effort to stop the leak could be made more difficult by the choppy waters of the North Sea. In a sign that some investors were concerned about the impact of the leak on Total, shares in the company fell 1.4 percent in Paris on Wednesday. Shares of other oil companies, including Eni of Italy and Royal Dutch Shell, also declined.'"

"'12-03-30,'1','Hey, Perseus! You’ve just dispatched Medusa, a horde of Furies and the dreaded Kraken, and rescued Andromeda and the city of Argos. Where are you off to now? Fishing?Seems reasonable for this demigod (Sam Worthington), the adopted son of a fisherman. But when you’re the hero of the 2010 “Clash of the Titans” remake — which made Warner Brothers almost $500 million worldwide — it’s inevitable that your real dad, Zeus (Liam Neeson), will hit you up for help.Previously, he and Hades (Ralph Fiennes) threatened mankind; now, in “Wrath of the Titans,” man’s faith in the gods is waning, and Olympian fat is on the fire. To remain immortal, Hades has allied himself with the petulant Ares (Edgar Ramirez) to free Kronos, the titan imprisoned in deepest Tartarus. Hi-yo, Pegasus!That’s about all the plot you get (or need) in this action spectacle. What you get in abundance, as before, are its true stars: monsters in digital (and in some theaters 3-D) detail, notably a chimera; three huge Cyclopes; Makhai (minions with two heads and torsos); and Kronos himself, a lumbering Gargantua of living lava, all engaged in furious, fairly bloodless PG-13 conflict.Of course, in a tradition dating to the original “Clash of the Titans,” from 1981, you also get lots of British thespians hamming it up with trifling dialogue; new recruits include Bill Nighy as Hephaestus, and Rosamund Pike as Andromeda (now a warrior queen). At least it doesn’t take itself too seriously. There are also soldiers, fireballs, smoke and sand. But not much to think about when the dust clears.“Wrath of the Titans” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has copious but largely harmless conflagration.'"

"'12-03-30,'1','As the journalism world looks to the nonprofit model for salvation in these challenging times for the industry, one of the oldest journalism nonprofits, the Center for Investigative Reporting, announced Tuesday that it would merge with one of the newest, The Bay Citizen.The deal, in which The Bay Citizen’s local news site, which went live in 2010, will become a brand operated by the Berkeley-based C.I.R., established in 1977, will most likely bring major changes to the newer organization’s coverage.

"'12-03-30,'1','“The fact they targeted Tibetan activists is a strong indicator of official Chinese government involvement,” said James A. Lewis, a former diplomat and expert in computer security who is a director and senior fellow at the in . “A private Chinese hacker may go after economic data but not a political organization.”Neither the Chinese embassy in Washington nor the Chinese consulate in New York answered requests for comment.The Trend Micro report describes systematic attacks on at least 233 personal computers. The victims include Indian military research organizations and shipping companies; aerospace, energy and engineering companies in Japan; and at least 30 computer systems of Tibetan advocacy groups, according to both the report and interviews with experts connected to the research. The espionage has been going on for at least 10 months and is continuing, the report says.In the report, the researchers detailed how they had traced the attacks to an e-mail address used to register one of the command-and-control servers that directed the attacks. They mapped that address to a QQ number — China’s equivalent of an online instant messaging screen name — and from there to an online alias.The person who used the alias, “scuhkr” — the researchers said in an interview that it could be shorthand for Sichuan University hacker — wrote articles about hacking, which were posted to online hacking forums and, in one case, recruited students to a computer network and defense research program at Sichuan University’s Institute of Information Security in 2005, the report said.traced that alias to Mr. Gu. According to online records, Mr. Gu studied at Sichuan University from 2003 to 2006, when he wrote numerous articles about hacking under the names of “scuhkr” and Gu Kaiyuan. Those included a master’s thesis about computer attacks and prevention strategies. The Times connected Mr. Gu to Tencent first through an online university forum, which listed where students found jobs, and then through a call to Tencent.Reached at Tencent and asked about the attacks, Mr. Gu said, “I have nothing to say.”Tencent, which is a privately managed and stock market-listed Internet company, did not respond to several later inquiries seeking comment.The attacks are technically similar to a spy operation known as the Shadow Network, which since 2009 has targeted the government of India and also pilfered a year’s worth of the ’s personal e-mails. Trend Micro’s researchers found that the command-and-control servers directing the Shadow Network attacks also directed the espionage in its report.The Shadow Network attacks were believed to be the work of hackers who studied in China’s Sichuan Province at the University of Electronic Science and Technology, another university in Chengdu, that also receives government financing for computer network defense research. The People’s Liberation Army has an online reconnaissance bureau in the city.Some security researchers suggest that the Chinese government may use people not affiliated with the government in hacking operations — what security professionals call a campaign.For example, earlier this year, Joe Stewart, a security expert at Dell SecureWorks, traced a campaign against the government and oil exploration companies to an e-mail address that belonged to an Internet marketer in China.“It suggested there may be a marketplace for freelance work — that this is not a 9-to-5 work environment,” Mr. Stewart said. “It’s a smart way to do business. If you are a country attacking a foreign government and you don’t want it tied back, it would make sense to outsource the work to actors who can collect the data for you.”The campaign detailed in the Trend Micro report was first documented two weeks ago by , a security firm based in Mountain View, Calif. It called the operation “Luckycat,” after the login name of one of the other attackers, and issued its own report. But Trend Micro’s report provides far more details. The two firms were unaware that they were both studying the same operation.Trend Micro’s researchers said they were first tipped off to the campaign three months ago when they received two malware samples from two separate computer attacks — one in Japan and another in — and found that they were both being directed from the same command-and-control servers. Over the next several months, they traced more than 90 different malware attacks back to those servers.Each attack began, as is often the case, with an e-mail intended to lure victims into opening an attachment. Indian victims were sent an e-mail about India’s ballistic missile defense program. Tibetan advocates received e-mails about self-immolation or, in one case, a job opening at the Tibet Fund, a nonprofit based in . After Japan’s earthquake and nuclear disaster, victims in Japan received an e-mail about radiation measurements.Each e-mail contained an attachment that, when clicked, automatically created a backdoor from the victim’s computer to the attackers’ servers. To do this, the hackers exploited security holes in Office and Adobe software. Almost immediately, they uploaded a directory of the victims’ machines to their servers. If the files looked enticing, hackers installed a remote-access tool, or rat, which gave them real-time control of their target’s machine. As long as a victim’s computer was connected to the Internet, attackers had the ability to record their keystrokes and passwords, grab screenshots and even crawl from that machine to other computers in the victim’s network.Trend Micro’s researchers would not identify the names of the victims in the attacks detailed in its report, but said that they had alerted the victims, and that many were working to remediate their systems.A spokesman for India’s Defense Ministry, Sitanshu Kar, said he was not aware of the report or of the attacks it described. Fumio Iwai, a deputy consul at the Japanese consulate in New York, declined to comment.As of Thursday, the campaign’s servers were still operating and computers continue to leak information.“This was not an individual attack that started and stopped,” said Nart Villeneuve, a researcher that helped lead Trend Micro’s efforts. “It’s a continuous campaign that has been going on for a long time. There are constant compromises going on all time. These guys are busy and stay busy.”'"
"'12-03-30,'1','Lawyers for companies are free to talk among themselves about the best practices in protecting consumer privacy, he said, but to give consumers faith in the process, “the sessions we conduct will be open and transparent.”The hearing on consumer privacy, the fifth by the House panel, comes after the recent release by the White House and the F.T.C. of recommendations for how to protect personal data that individuals leave behind when they surf the Internet.As Internet privacy has become a bigger issue in Washington, technology companies have been increasing their lobbying. Google and Facebook recently bolstered their lobbying teams. Google hired Susan Molinari, a former New York congresswoman. Facebook hired Greg Maurer, a former aide to House Speaker John Boehner.Both companies, along with others, are likely to be engaged in the coming months with the trade commission, which called this week for legislation to regulate data brokers, companies that buy and sell personal data to help build online profiles of consumers. Technology companies fear that the F.T.C. might be drafting a definition of data brokers that is so broad it includes almost any company that collects user information online.Jon Leibowitz, the F.T.C.’s chairman, also got the industry’s attention when he said this week that if companies could not create robust Do Not Track policies themselves, he would favor legislation requiring it.Some members of Congress are not so sure.“Before we do any possible harm to the Internet, we need to understand what harm is actually being done to consumers,” Representative Mary Bono Mack, a California Republican and subcommittee chairwoman, said at the hearing. “Where is the public outcry for legislation? Today, I’m simply not hearing it. I haven’t gotten a single letter from anyone back home urging me to pass a privacy bill.”The idea of a law requiring companies to permit consumers to forbid tracking them online has upset several technology companies as well. When the White House presented its privacy framework in February, an online advertising alliance said it would support adding a Do Not Track option to all browsers by the end of 2012.When the trade commission released its report on Monday, however, members of the group, the Digital Advertising Alliance, said they were surprised by Mr. Leibowitz’s comments about Do Not Track legislation. He said the commission took Do Not Track to mean not collecting any data from consumers.The advertising group, however, defines it as forbidding the serving of targeted ads to individuals but not prohibiting the collection of data.“That is not what was agreed to,” Linda A. Woolley, executive vice president of the Direct Marketing Association, a member of the digital alliance, said Thursday in an interview. She said that was like moving the goal posts.Some technology companies are continuing to head down the path of Do Not Track, at a speed far more rapid than the usual pace of Congressional legislation. On Thursday, Yahoo said that it would put a Do Not Track option on its sites that would tell its network sites that a user did not want to be tracked.Users who turn on the Do Not Track option in their browsers and visit a Yahoo Web site will not see targeted ads, the company said, but the site will collect user data. The announcement follows similar moves by companies that make browsers, including Mozilla, the maker of Firefox, to include a Do Not Track mechanism in their privacy settings.'"
"'12-03-30,'1','In the Surrealist parlor game exquisite corpse, artists build a figure on an absurd assembly line. Typically a piece of paper is folded into sections and passed around; the challenge is that each artist must work on one particular segment without having seen the others. The results are often monstrous, or at least mismatched.In one example from the late 1920s by Yves Tanguy, Joan Miró, Max Morise and Man Ray, a head with donkey ears descends into a snail’s torso, sprouts women’s legs and ends in a pair of pointed stumps that balance on snowshoes.The sum of these parts is one of the many grotesque creatures in “Exquisite Corpses: Drawing and Disfiguration,” at the Museum of Modern Art. This entertaining little show expands on the Surrealists’ diversion, rustling up other examples of distorted or disjointed figuration from MoMA’s permanent collection.There’s much here to amuse, provoke and titillate, and not all of it is drawing; see, for instance, Louise Bourgeois’s dangling latex phallus titled “Little Girl” or a Hans Bellmer doll with an extra pelvis where its head should be. And the show’s organizers, Samantha Friedman, a curatorial assistant, and Jodi Hauptman, the drawings curator, make some interesting modern-contemporary pairings: Miró and Jim Nutt, Hannah Höch and Nicola Tyson.But the show overlooks one of the most contemporary aspects of exquisite corpse: its fruitful mix of collaboration and chance and independent operation. I’m thinking, by way of example, of a recent gallery performance by the four-person Austrian artist-collective Gelitin. Each group member spent a week or so making sculpture while blindfolded, assisted by a frequently changing cast of guest artists.I don’t mean to say that this particular piece should have been acknowledged. (It’s not in MoMA’s collection, for one thing.) But a smattering of video or performance in the same spirit would have been welcome. It seems odd that a show inspired by a group activity mostly includes works by individuals.'"
"'12-03-30,'1','It is a metaphysically pointed arrangement. The Buddha and the bodhisattvas belong to an eternal, transcendental realm that rules over earthly time and space. Implicitly the lively beings of material creation are gathered here to bask in the beneficence of their cosmic overlord. No doubt that was the program intended by Jakuchu, who retired at 40 from running a large grocery business he inherited from his father to devote himself to art and Zen.But now the experience of the ensemble is something else. While the nature paintings teem with life — figuratively as well as formally — the paintings of the reigning deities are so conventional and dull it is hard to believe they were made by the same artist. In fact Jakuchu copied them from a triptych attributed to a 13th-century painter, Zhang Sigong, that he discovered at Tofukuji, another monastery in Kyoto. Regardless, it clearly was not traditional theology but worldly reality that turned Jakuchu on.If “turned on” sounds like an anachronistic phrase to apply to an 18th-century artist, consider the paintings. Their vividness conveys a state of attentiveness and responsiveness to which ordinary consciousness, in its distraction and world-weary fatigue, rarely rises. This partly has to do with Jakuchu’s extraordinary powers of observation and painterly description. The profusion of realistic detail and the way feathers, blossoms, tree leaves and myriad other elements are deftly individualized is hypnotically gripping.Looking closely at “Maple Tree and Small Birds” you see that each of the hundreds of red leaves growing from arcing, gnarly branches is distinctly different. Some glow bright red, some are nearly drab green; some are opaque, some let light through. “Shells” has 146 varieties of seashells — mussel, oyster, conch, snail, starfish and many more — scattered over a sandy expanse, each described with loving exactitude. “Pond and Insects” pictures 76 species of bugs along with lizards, frogs and a coiled snake.Among 18 marine species all swimming down toward the left in “Fish” is a big gold sea bream whose every scale and spiny fin is neatly articulated. But that is not all: Jakuchu also captures the iridescent sheen of its fat orange-and-white body.The accumulation of zoological and botanical information could be exhausting were it not for another of Jakuchu’s remarkable talents: his virtuosic way with composition. Some works, like “Peonies and Small Birds,” are crammed nearly to bursting with blossoms. Others have open spaces letting in air and light.In “Rooster and Hen” a flamboyantly multihued male and an all-black female perform a tense mating dance on an open field of unpainted fabric, which concentrates the erotic drama. In “Wild Goose and Reeds” a single big bird plummets straight down from the sky toward a surface of cracked ice, and the background expanse of unpainted light-brown silk, framed by reeds bearing globs of melting snow, evokes airy space.Many of the later compositions produce a delirious confusion of gravitational orientation. In “Lotus Pond and Fish” flat, circular leaves and pink and white blossoms viewed from divergent perspectives surround a school of small, silvery fish. It makes sense at a glance; but the more you look, the harder it is to tell what is up and what is down, and the more confoundingly dreamy it becomes.“Chickens” has 12 roosters and a hen crowded together into a dazzling tapestry of brown, black and white plumage punctuated by bright red cockscombs and wattles and staring eyes. It is an impossible situation; you could never assemble so many cocky males and one female into such close quarters without violence breaking out. The effect is of a sly, anthropomorphic comedy.Jakuchu was not painting social satires or moral allegories. But especially in the later examples, images of the ostensibly natural world and its denizens become metaphorical mirrors of an irrepressibly lively mind. Nothing is fixed; all is in flux in nature as in consciousness. Up and down, inside and out, male and female, plant and animal, water and rock, unpainted silk and open air: these are provincial, merely human categories. That is why the Buddha remains so implacably calm. Ensconced on his transcendental throne, he is unruffled by the delusory problems we bipeds create for ourselves.There will always be artists who aspire to Buddha-like abstraction. The grid-and-stripe painter Agnes Martin did for example. But I much prefer Jakuchu’s joyful immersion in the colorful realm of living beings.'"
"'12-03-30,'1','In the absence of any new lending, “the combined lending ceiling of the E.S.M. and the E.F.S.F. will thus be set at 700 billion euros for the period after mid-2013,” the statement said.Ministers also could agree to capitalize the permanent fund more quickly than previously planned by making the final installment of five payments of 16 billion euros each in the first half of 2014. Each 16 billion euro installment is leveraged to create lending capacity of about 100 billion euros, bringing total firepower to 500 billion euros.The draft could change during the gathering, which will include the governors of the central banks of all European Union member states.Views differ sharply across Europe, and the world, on how to build the most effective firewall.So-called maximalists like Ángel Gurría, secretary general of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, based in Paris, have repeatedly called for a fund of about 1 trillion euros. Mr. Gurría said this week that the “mother of all firewalls” was necessary to prevent another crisis in Europe.A firewall amounting to 1 trillion euros would be an effective “nuclear” deterrent against speculative threats to the euro zone, François Baroin, the French finance minister, told BFM Business television Thursday.A commitment by Europe to put more of its own resources at stake could also nudge donors to the International Monetary Fund, including the United States and China, to pledge more to the fund. That would give the fund, which has taken part in the three euro zone bailouts, more resources to help bail out other European countries, if necessary.But the maximalist approach has inflamed some European leaders, who say putting up so much money could encourage some countries to reduce their commitments to austerity and could put at even greater risk the taxpayers in Germany and elsewhere who would bear the bailout funds’ liabilities.In an apparent swipe at Mr. Gurría’s suggestion of a 1 trillion euro fund, Steffen Siebert, the German government spokesman, said Wednesday that it was “regrettable that in these discussions obviously no figure is high enough.” Such suggestions are counterproductive, Mr. Siebert said, as “they further unsettle the markets.”Speaking late on Thursday in Copenhagen, Wolfgang Schäuble, the German finance minister, suggested that any sum agreed to by ministers on Friday would not be more than 800 billion euros.The future leadership of the euro zone is another topic likely to be discussed at the meeting, but probably on the margins.The current leader of the so-called Eurogroup of euro zone finance ministers is Jean-Claude Juncker of Luxembourg. His term will end in June, and speculation is widespread that his successor could be Mr. Schäuble.But such an appointment also could make it more difficult to keep another German, Klaus Regling, at the head of the stability facility.'"
"'12-03-30,'1','MADRID — A panel of Spanish judges has dismissed a rape case against Prince Alwaleed bin Talal bin Abdulaziz al-Saud, a billionaire investor and nephew of King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia, citing a lack of evidence.The case dates from August 2008, when a 20-year-old model filed a complaint with the police on the Spanish island of Ibiza accusing Prince Alwaleed of raping her on a yacht.Lawyers for Prince Alwaleed denied the rape allegations and provided evidence that the prince was not in Ibiza at the time of the alleged crime.In its decision, dated Monday, the panel of three judges in Palma de Mallorca, the capital city of the Balearic Islands region that includes Ibiza, said that there was not enough evidence to establish what happened on the night of the alleged rape, and that there were not enough facts to conclude that Prince Alwaleed was involved.The prince’s office and his lawyers welcomed the ruling, and said in a statement that they would pursue legal action against the model, her mother and her attorneys. “No one’s character should be subject to such dishonest attacks,” said one of the prince’s lawyers, Javier Sánchez-Vera Gómez-Trelles. “We intend to vigorously pursue all legal options at our disposal, and send a clear message that such unprincipled and base behavior is not acceptable and will not be tolerated in a civil society.”The judge in Ibiza who first heard the case closed it in July 2010 for lack of evidence, but it was reopened last year by the appeals court in Palma de Mallorca, based on the model’s assertion that she was drugged at an Ibiza nightclub before being taken to the yacht and raped there.Max Turiel, a lawyer representing the model, who was identified only by her middle name, Soraya, said that he regretted the appeals court’s decision. He said that the judges’ ruling contained “contradictions and misinterpretations” and that “we will continue to try to find the truth.”'"

"'12-03-30,'1','Arab leaders and diplomats offered platitudes about reform and democracy while glossing over the treatment of religious and ethnic minorities, political opponents and dissidents in their own countries. No one discussed the violence in the Persian Gulf state of Bahrain, where the Sunni monarchy with its allies in Saudi Arabia violently suppressed a largely peaceful Shiite uprising. Fewer than half of the league’s heads of state showed up, and only one from a gulf nation, the Kuwaiti emir.And in another constant with the past, the Arab League failed to address the issue of the day substantively. In this case, the membership was unable to offer any concrete plan for easing the deepening humanitarian crisis in Syria, a struggle whose increasingly sectarian dimensions were on display at the gathering.“The summit is now almost inconsequential,” Mohamad Bazzi, an adjunct fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, said in a discussion published on the council’s Web site. “The events on the ground have accelerated to the point that Arab leaders are playing catch-up, and Syria is the perfect example.”In its most significant action of the three-day meeting, the group adopted a resolution on Thursday urging Syria’s government to adhere to a six-point cease-fire proposal brokered by the United Nations. The Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad, has agreed to the cease-fire, but continuing violence has deepened fears that he will not abide by the proposal.Speech after speech on Thursday paid homage to the people of Syria, where the United Nations estimates that 9,000 civilians have been killed. The leaders condemned Mr. Assad’s government as committing humanitarian crimes against its own people.But analysts said the Arab League had ceded any leadership to the United Nations and dialed back its own ambitions in the wake of a failed mission sending observers to Syria. The Foreign Ministry in Damascus on Thursday repeated its rejection of any decisions at the meeting related to Syria.Although Saudi Arabia and Qatar — which sent only low-level delegations to the summit meeting — have called for more aggressive action against Mr. Assad, the leaders gathered in Baghdad refused to consider any more muscular options. They declined to call for Mr. Assad to go, and said they had not even considered whether to endorse arming opposition forces. That was partly a reflection of internal divisions among Arab leaders, some of whom continue to resist pressuring Mr. Assad to step down.“We have already tried to find an Arab solution to this issue, but we didn’t succeed,” Iraq’s foreign minister, Hoshyar Zebari, said at a news conference on Wednesday night. “We have no new initiative to bring except for the issues we’ve already discussed.”Instead of substance, the meeting offered symbolism. And for the Shiite-led Iraqi government, which spent two years and $500 million preparing a war-scarred capital for the meeting, symbolism may have been enough.Iraqi officials saw the three-day event as their chance to shrug off Iraq’s status as a diplomatic pariah and re-enter the Arab world as an independent nation that can hold its ground against powerful neighbors like Shiite Iran, Sunni Saudi Arabia and an economically and politically ascendant Turkey.Iraqi diplomats worked to smooth over relations with Sunni Arab neighbors before the gathering, agreeing to pay off decades-old debts. For the arriving guests, the government provided lavish meals, spotless new accommodations and sleek black Mercedes sedans.At least 10 Arab leaders did attend the summit meeting, including those of Lebanon, Sudan, Tunisia and Kuwait, which was invaded by Saddam Hussein in 1990.In a glimpse of at least partial reconciliation, Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki and the Kuwaiti emir exchanged kisses on the tarmac at Baghdad’s airport and marched down a red carpet together.“I hope this will remind the Arabs that Iraq is a very important Arab country, and must get back to where it should be — in an Arab environment rather than under the Iranian influence,” said Mohammad Abdullah al-Zulfa, a historian and a former member of the Saudi Shura Council.But there were slights. Explaining the decision not to attend, Qatar’s prime minister, Sheik Hamad bin Jassim al-Thani, said in an interview with Al Jazeera that his nation was “sending a message” signaling discontent with the growing sectarianism in Iraqi politics and the deep disenfranchisement among Iraq’s Sunni minority.But Iraqi officials were relieved that their worst fears of disruptive violence did not come to pass. A rocket exploded outside the Iranian Embassy not far from the International Zone on Thursday afternoon, but officials said no one was hurt.Otherwise, the normally frenetic capital was as quiet as a vacation town in the off season. Nearly every bridge over the Tigris River was closed to traffic. Roads were blocked by brambles of concertina wire, entire neighborhoods sealed off. Residents in several neighborhoods in western Baghdad said they had no cellphone service, suggesting that the government had cut the mobile networks to try to prevent terrorist attacks.As the visiting dignitaries boarded their private planes on Thursday and began streaming home, there was no word on when the extreme security measures would be lifted.'"

"'12-03-31,'0','The first church they sold was in Long Beach, to a Korean congregation that paid $250,000. “We became really good friends with the pastor,” said Mrs. Raphael, who is tall, with long graying hair and fashionable ovoid glasses.The Raphaels met in a square-dancing class at Long Beach State University in 1971 and married the next year. They were both raised Presbyterian, Mrs. Raphael in Marysville, a small town near Sacramento, and Mr. Raphael in Bellflower, in Southern California. They have two children — a son who is a collegiate debate coach in Hawaii, and a daughter who is a public school teacher in Compton.The church world in which the Raphaels were raised seems distant from the exurban sprawl of Azusa, filled with industrial parks and strip malls.“Southern California, back in the 1950s, things were basically closed on Sundays,” Mr. Raphael said. “Maybe one gas station was open. Everybody went to church. Some of the congregations took it for granted you were there, and if you didn’t show up, they knew you were sick. They sent somebody to find out if you were O.K.”But a lot has changed, including preferences in church architecture. “They don’t want the traditional look anymore,” Mrs. Raphael said. “They’re going for the industrial look.”She said that because city ordinances require one parking spot for every three seats in the pews, parking is essential. In industrial spaces, “you can often get permission to use parking from adjacent lots on Sundays,” when the neighboring businesses do not require the spaces.“Everyone wants something close to the freeway, with lots of parking and a lot of seating capacity,” Mrs. Raphael said.In Azusa now, the growth for them is in immigrant churches — Asian and Latino, mainly. Churches serving African-American and white communities are closing.The Raphaels have six listings now, and while they say the market for church buildings has held up better than the residential market, times are still worse than they have ever seen.In their first 31 years in the business, they say they never saw a church foreclosure. But in the last two years, they have worked with 10 churches on foreclosure issues.“We’re getting calls like, ‘We can’t pay our loans, we have to refinance.’ And now you can’t even get financing at all,” Mr. Raphael said. “It’s always been hard, because for churches they want 30 or 40 percent down. But now even the Christian credit unions aren’t lending.“The members are out of work,” he continued. “They’re not tithing, and the churches have gone through their reserves, and now they can’t pay the mortgage.”“Some churches had their buildings paid off,” Mrs. Raphael interjected, “but they needed money for programming, so they took out a mortgage, and now they can’t pay it.”“The pastors will ask me if I myself know of job openings for their members,” Mr. Raphael said.Across the country, 138 church properties were sold by banks last year, compared with just 24 in 2008, according to CoStar, a real estate information company. And according to LoopNet, a nationwide commercial property sales site, more than 140 church properties were for sale this week in five Southern California counties — Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino and San Diego — and the Raphaels say 10 to 20 of them are financially distressed.The Raphaels recently represented an African-American pastor who led a once-august church in Los Angeles.“The piano in the basement had been signed by Ray Charles,” who had been a member, Mr. Raphael said. “But the neighborhood had changed — it was Hispanic. The pastor said he’d knocked on doors to get people to come, but he couldn’t speak the language. So he moved the church elsewhere.” (The piano stayed behind.)It can be a painful decision to sell a church, and the Raphaels often find themselves addressing church boards that struggle with the decision, even though they have to. “They have so many memories,” Mr. Raphael said. “Their kids were married here.”By law, the Raphaels cannot refuse to show a building to buyers because of their race or religion. But they have clients who try to ignore the law. They once found a buyer for a synagogue building, but the rabbi would not sell because the buyer wanted it for a mosque.“Then you have the Christian groups that discriminate,” Mrs. Raphael said, including one that would not sell to a Buddhist group.They also had a group that did not want to deal with her because she is a woman. “At first their agent said a woman shouldn’t shake hands with them,” Mrs. Raphael said.“Then he called back and said, ‘Don’t get within 15 feet of them.’ Then he called back and said, ‘Stay in the car.’'"

The company plans to cover 55 percent of the project’s estimated $10.2 billion cost, with Santee Cooper, South Carolina’s largest power producer, paying the remainder. Based in Cayce, S.C., Scana, which submitted its application to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission in March 2008, said its first unit would not begin operating until 2017, about a year behind schedule, because of delays in the commission’s licensing process.

"'12-03-31,'0','Michael Taylor, Lieutenant Delisle’s attorney, declined to discuss the specifics of the case. But he said that the evidence released to him by the government did not support comparisons that have been raised with the WikiLeaks case, in which hundreds of thousands of classified American diplomatic cables were leaked.Because Mr. Taylor successfully requested a publication ban on evidence presented at the bail hearing, the hearing and the rejection, decided by Judge Barbara Beach of the Nova Scotia Provincial Court in Halifax, revealed little.The defendant’s history and character remain almost equally shrouded, despite extensive news media attention in Canada.He was raised in a suburb of Halifax, Lower Sackville, known mainly for strip malls, a concentration of co-op housing and a middle-class work force that powers the many nearby military bases.Several former classmates said they could remember nothing about him. One who did recalled “a very, very quiet guy.”Never in trouble, not an athlete, a reasonable student, said the classmate, Ian Wilson, now a union official.“He had a small group of friends,” Mr. Wilson said. “He was one of the guys who just flew under the radar. Not an introvert, but just one of those who were just there, like most kids in the school.”The one activity he clearly remembered him taking part in was the “school police,” which provided security at hockey games and dances.Lieutenant Delisle moved away after graduation in 1990, but Mr. Wilson did not know to where. They lost touch.But Lieutenant Delisle was back by 1996, when he joined the military as a reservist. He was assigned to the 3 Intelligence Company, an army training group in Halifax, earning a modest income as an “intelligence operator,” an apparently low-level clerical position.A year later, he married, but eventually divorced. His ex-wife, Jennifer Lee Janes, now lives in suburban Ottawa.The young couple’s expenses apparently outstripped their income. In 1998 he filed for bankruptcy, listing liabilities of $18,587 and assets of $1,000.His progress in the military was slow. He joined the regular forces in March 2001 still a private, making sergeant in November 2006. He was stationed at the time in the office of the Chief of Defense Intelligence in Ottawa. There, in 2007, according to court documents, his first “breach of trust” occurred.In 2008, the military sent him to the prestigious Royal Military College of Canada in Kingston, Ontario, for an intense, two-year program. He was commissioned as an officer and graduated with a B.A.On a MySpace page created at that time, he listed his interests: “Computers, reading, firearms, gardening and physical activity! I cannot forget about tossing the ol’pigskin and watching Monday Night Football!! HoowaH! I also love fishing, camping, canoeing!!”He returned to Halifax in 2010 to work at the Trinity intelligence center, but appeared to fall into more financial difficulty. As part of his divorce settlement that year, Lieutenant Delisle agreed to assume debts on three credit cards and an outstanding loan.American officials, like their Canadian counterparts, say it is still unclear what specific information and how much was divulged. “We’re working together to better understand what information was compromised and what the impact is,” said the American official.'"

The association’s report on the electronics manufacturing giant Foxconn, undertaken at Apple’s request and released on Thursday, received generally favorable reviews for its toughness — even from some people unhappy with the group’s other reports.“The F.L.A. did a fine job with the report,” said Dara O’Rourke, a workplace monitoring expert and professor of labor policy at the University of California, Berkeley. “This report is serious. It’s detailed.”He praised the association for uncovering problems that Apple’s internal monitors had not found, including the existence of a cheat sheet given to workers to help them deceive auditors about their work hours. Apple’s internal monitors had also given Foxconn high marks on freedom of association, but the F.L.A. found the unions at Foxconn to be dominated by company managers.The Fair Labor Association was founded in 1999 by nonprofit groups, universities and several American apparel companies, including Nike and Liz Claiborne, that said they hoped to eliminate sweatshop abuses.'"

"'12-03-31,'0','On Thursday, when asked about the attacks, Mr. Gu said, “I have nothing to say.” On Friday, however, he denied involvement.In a message posted on Weibo, China’s Twitter-like social media service, Mr. Gu said: “The QQ number associated with the hacker-controlled server belongs to my classmate, not me. I have not participated in any hacking.”Sichuan University also issued a written statement late Friday by e-mail, saying it had never “hired any unit or individual to participate in Internet attacks or hacking activities.”The report does not say precisely how many hackers were involved, but it suggests that the main attacker used the alias “scuhkr,” which may stand for Sichuan University hacker, a researcher said.Mr. Gu, the Tencent employee, has used the alias “scuhkr,” and he agreed on Friday that a QQ number mentioned in the report belonged to him. In several articles he wrote, he used both his real name and the alias “scuhkr.”But he and a Tencent executive said on Friday that the report also included a second QQ number that did not belong to Mr. Gu and that was more likely related to the attacks.“We have checked with our colleague Mr. Gu Kaiyuan, who denied he was involved in any hacking activities,” Tencent said in its statement. “Nor was he named by the author of the report as a hacker.”In an interview on Friday, Nart Villeneuve, a researcher who helped lead Trend Micro’s effort, said there appeared to be one hacker using multiple QQ numbers and aliases.“That’s what it seemed like to me based on the posts I saw online,” he said. “We saw two aliases, ‘dang0102’ and ‘scuhrk,’ make separate posts that contained the same QQ number that was used to register a command and control server.”But he did not rule out more than one hacker.Sichuan University also suggested that two people were associated with the QQ numbers in the report. In a statement, it said: “Sichuan University had two students who used the nicknames of ‘dang0102’ and ‘scuhkr,’ ” — which were both mentioned in the Trend Micro report. “But they never participated in malicious Internet attacks or hacking activities while at school and have graduated and left the university several years ago.”According to Trend Micro’s report, the hacker used a variety of types of malware, including some tied to an earlier cyberespionage campaign. The attacks breached 233 computers, according to the report. They aimed at Japanese companies, an Indian military research organization and activists and nongovernmental organizations related to Tibet, among others, the report said.The researchers did not suggest the attacks had been the work of government-employed hackers, but security experts said the methods and victims suggested a state-backed campaign. Chinese officials did not respond to the release of the report on Friday.'"
"'12-03-31,'0','So Bombay/6 Ave. Pizza shrank its price to $1 too.All was good until last October, when a third player entered the drama.A 2 Bros. Pizza, part of an enlarging New York chain of 11 shops that sell slices for a dollar, opened virtually next door to Bombay/6 Ave. Pizza. The only separation is a stairwell that leads up to a barbershop and hair salon.Price stability at a buck all around persisted until eight days ago, when both 2 Bros. and Bombay/6 Ave. Pizza began selling pizza for the eye-catching price of 75 cents a slice, tax included — three slender quarters.The primary owner of Bombay/6 Ave. Pizza is Ramanlal Patel, 68, who also has a few businesses in Atlanta and holds property in India.His nephew, Bravin Patel, 45, oversees the establishment. He and his manager, Mohid Kumar, 49, were there the other day griping about 75-cent pizza.They said that 2 Bros. was trying to drive them out of business, that 2 Bros., unprovoked, slashed the price to 75 cents, forcing them to follow, that things were miserable, that Ramanlal Patel has serious kidney problems, that property in India had to be sold to keep the place going.Depicting the battle as “small guy” (Bombay) against “big guy” (2 Bros.), Mr. Patel said: “He comes in and he thinks he’s king.”Mr. Kumar said he was contemplating checking with a lawyer to see if there might be a city law that somehow prohibits a business from selling pizza at outlandishly cheap prices.But as is so often the case in battles like these, the other side told a slightly different story.At the St. Marks Place office of 2 Bros., its owners, the Halali brothers Eli, 29, and Oren, 27, identified the true aggressor as Bombay/6 Ave. Pizza.Here’s how they described it:On Thursday evening a week ago, Bombay/6 Ave. — unprovoked, and without warning — cut its pizza price to 79 cents. The next morning, 2 Bros. retaliated by moving to 75 cents (its owners felt it was easier to make change from a dollar than at 79 cents). Bombay/6 Ave. matched the 75 cents, and that’s where everything sits.“We don’t sell pizza at 75 cents,” Eli Halali said. “But if they think they’re going to sit next to us and sell at 75 cents, they’ve got another think coming.”Could they prove it? At this point, it was just one pizza seller’s word versus another’s.But 2 Bros. has a security camera. Winding back to the night in question, the night of the sudden 21-cent price drop, a manager found frames that showed the front of the two stores. And there it was: Bombay/6 Ave. Pizza’s 79-cent sign when 2 Bros. was at $1. Mr. Patel and Mr. Kumar had made the first move.When they were apprised of this information, they said they did not realize there had been interest in talking about 79-cent pizza.Why, then, did they lower their price first?“He was taking away our customers,” Mr. Kumar said. “How were we going to pay our rent?”For his part, Eli Halali made it clear that 75 cents was a temporary price point. He said he could not make money at that level and eventually would return to $1. He said that if Bombay/6 Ave. Pizza went back to $1, he would as well.If it didn’t, he said, it better watch out.His father, Joshua Halali, who acts as a consultant to 2 Bros., said, “I suggested to my children to go to 50 cents.”Oren Halali said, “We might go to free pizza soon.”Eli said: “We have enough power to wait them out. They’re not going to make a fool of us.”The brothers said they are also contemplating adding fried chicken to the Avenue of the Americas store to intensify the pressure on Bombay/6 Ave. Pizza.Meanwhile, Mr. Patel remains intransigent. “We’re never going back to $1,” he said. “We’re going lower.”“We may go to 50 cents,” Mr. Kumar said. Of his next-door rival, he said: “I want to hit him. I want to beat him.”They had added the name, Pizza King, to the sidewalk sign out front, hoping a regal nickname might do some good.Related prices at both establishments have also tumbled. The special of two slices and a drink dropped to $2.25 from $2.75. An entire pie fell to $6 from $8 (actually to $5.99 at Bombay/6 Ave. Pizza).A haircut at the barber located between them is $12. Better that you eat.As for Joey Pepperoni’s, Met Zade, one of the owners, said: “I can tell you we’re absolutely not dropping our price. For $1 a slice, you can still make a profit. For $1, an owner can still sit down and eat. At 75 cents, you’d be a mouse on a wheel.”While the pizza parlors insult one another, the eating public couldn’t be happier.At 6 Ave. Pizza, Mike Dooley, 60, a maintenance worker, said while polishing off a slice: “I think it’s beautiful. We need 75-cent hamburgers next.”At 2 Bros., John Combs, 46, a carpenter, said, with a mouthful of pizza: “It’s awesome. I’m from Jersey, but any time I’m in the city I’ll be back. It’s awesome.”'"

Buoyed by a crowd with a distinct South American flavor, Monaco, an Argentine, fought back in the second set to force a tiebreaker.In the seventh point of the tiebreaker, Djokovic won a 26-shot rally when Monaco’s shot sailed long, and he did not trail again.Nadal will now turn his attention to the clay-court season, which culminates with the French Open, which begins May 27. With six championships at Roland Garros, Nadal is tied with Bjorn Borg for the most men’s singles titles at the tournament and will be the favorite to win No. 7 if he is healthy.Nadal’s health has long been an issue. His punishing style of tennis has helped him wear down opponents and win a career Grand Slam, but it also has taken its toll.Even if he had been 100 percent on Friday, Nadal could have faced a tough challenge as he sought to win his first Sony Ericsson title. Nadal is 13-5 against Murray, the No. 4 seed, but lost to him in October in the finals at Tokyo.Murray, 24, looking to break the Nadal-Djokovic-Roger Federer triumvirate, had relished another shot against Nadal.“Every time you play against one of the top guys in the world, it’s always a good opportunity to see where your game’s at,” Murray said.Nadal is hoping for a speedy recovery, and he still plans to begin his clay-court season in mid-April at the Monte Carlo Masters.“It looks like it’s nothing really different than happened a few times in the past,” he said. “Hopefully, with a few days off and with the right treatment, I will be in the right condition to start to practice on the clay. I know what to do to get better quick, and that’s what we’re going to try.”'"
"'12-03-31,'0','Only then, when I had wiped out my first son’s entire line, could I rest assured that my kingdom would pass to my second son, the brilliant and talented Duke Gilla-Comgain. I was exposed as a kinslayer and reviled, but I went to my death soon after with a clear conscience. I knew that what I had done was for the good of the family.In other words, it was just another Thursday night playing Crusader Kings II, the captivating new computer strategy game from Paradox Interactive.If politics, European history, family dynamics and grand strategic ambition interest or entertain you — and if you might like to try your hand as a fictional participant rather than merely a reader or watcher — Crusader Kings II will provide all of the storylines and drama you could ever want.You start in 1066 as any of hundreds of different counts, dukes or kings from Iceland to Acre. You can jump in as an unknown count on the edge of Hungary, an Italian prince, a duke in the Holy Roman Empire, a Norwegian warlord, the king of Poland, a Byzantine functionary or William the Conqueror himself as he invades England.You have until 1452 to make your dynasty as powerful as possible. As each individual character dies you take over as his legal successor. If you perish without a legal heir or lose all your territory, it’s game over.But this is not a game where you are simply moving armies around on a map; that’s the least of it. Its world is populated by thousands of fictional characters, all with their own abilities and personalities. All the courtiers and nobles, all the wives and children and cousins are modeled with their own opinions of and relationships with every other character in the game. The historical, the personal and political are all randomized within parameters that lend eerie verisimilitude to these alternate histories.For example, when King Flann’s father took over County Tyrconnell in 1066, the forces of Islam controlled a bit more than half of the Iberian peninsula. But over the subsequent decades the kingdoms of Castille, Navarra and Aragon fell to the Moors. Well it turns out that Flann’s uncle had married the widow of the king of Castille (who died fighting the Muslims), so when those kingdoms fell all of the nobles fled to Flann’s court in Ireland, which is pretty much a straight shot north from Spain anyway.So now we have historical claims to the kingdoms of Spain intermingling with our Irish bloodlines. Now that we’ve secured all of Ireland and I’ve straightened out our succession through my ruthless assassinations it’s time to take back Spain. Meanwhile, like all medieval rulers I have to curry favor with the Pope (unless I appoint my own antipope and force a schism).In practice, just maintaining your line and surviving is a considerable feat. And as in real life, the most dangerous enemies to any ruler come not from abroad but from his own household.Untitled second and third sons, jealous lovers, ambitious stepmothers, rival dukes — dealing with these are what take up your time as a medieval noble (or should if you’re smart, unlike King Flann). The most important decisions you make in this game are not military, but about to whom to betroth your children.Crusader Kings II, available for Windows, does make me want to read books, but not fiction like “Game of Thrones.” Instead, it makes me want to read more history. This game makes me want to read about relations between state and church in 13th-century France. It makes me want to learn more about medieval Polish culture. This is what a great game should do: use fictionalization and interactivity to prompt increased engagement with the real world.Amid all of the lovingly rendered explosions and clickfests that represent much electronic entertainment, seriously intelligent strategy games don’t get much attention these days. There was a time when the likes of SimCity and Civilization were mainstream. But in 2012, the closest most people get to a real strategy game is a fatuous timekiller like FarmVille. Real-time strategy games like StarCraft II are incredible in their own way, but they rely at least as much upon your ability to crank out dozens or hundreds of physical actions per minute (pressing keys) as your ability to think clearly.Luckily, there are still a few people making smashing historical strategy simulations like Crusader Kings II. King Flann thanks them for it, even if he had to kill his own son.'"
"'12-03-31,'0','And for this one seemingly prohibitive matchup, Pitino — with age lines hardening his famously boyish face as he pushes 60 and revels in grandfatherhood — can again be little Ricky. Who, back in the day, incorporated a whole lot of Rocky.“I truly believe that Rick relishes the role of being the underdog,” said Stu Jackson, who was one of Pitino’s Providence assistants and is now the N.B.A.’s executive vice president for basketball operations. “But I think there is also another component to that. Rick’s greatest passion has been to be an innovator, to figure out a way to make teams that aren’t the most talented greater than the sum of their parts.”Still the loyalist after all these years, Jackson added: “So the fact that they had injuries early, that — and he’s going to kill me for saying this — he’s had to somewhat change the full-court pressure and that this is not, quite frankly, one of his best perimeter-shooting teams, you can just see the satisfaction on his face.”And, really, Pitino has nothing but a game to lose at the Final Four because most people who know the ball is round fully expect Kentucky to win. Isn’t that why that first professional success is so much more fun, because risk is minimal and gravitational law makes it impossible to fall until you have flown?The heavy pressure Saturday will be on Calipari, who, despite all the talent he has rented for Kentucky, has failed to win the national championship there (or anywhere) as Pitino did in 1996. Eventually Pitino left Kentucky, to a second shot at the pros with the Boston Celtics before settling at Louisville in 2001 for his longest haul. Not coincidently, or at least subconsciously, ascribing himself as the in-state upstart in the process.So, here, apparently, is what Pitino has been plotting for from the day he arrived. No wonder he told reporters that this Louisville team indeed reminded him of 1987, when his full-court-pressing and 3-point-shooting Friars — in the first tournament to feature the now wildly popular long ball — helped relieve his family’s anguish after the death of his young son.Yes, there is a providential ring to Pitino’s sixth Final Four (with three universities), said Gordon Chiesa, another former Pitino assistant with the Friars who speculated that his old boss might have been happiest the first time around, when he was “overworked and underpaid.”Chiesa, who works for the N.B.A. Development League, used to call the ’87 Friars “Cinderella in black Converse,” and he wasted no time pointing out that their road to the Final Four also took them to New Orleans. On top of that, when Providence shocked its Big East rival, mighty Georgetown, in the regional final, the game was played at Louisville’s Freedom Hall.More karma, then to now: When Pitino took his Cardinals into Providence for an early January game that coincided with the ’87 team reunion, the energized Friars won by 21 — the only blowout defeat of Louisville all season. There was also last weekend’s showdown with Florida and Coach Billy Donovan — Pitino’s star guard at Providence and his most decorated protégé — in this tournament’s regional final.“Twenty-five years later, let’s face it, it’s the same mentality,” Chiesa said. “And you know Rick will fire those kids up. He will convince them they have a chance.”Call it a strategy, a style, or an act that combines competitive charm with an artist’s con that predictably had limited success with the N.B.A.’s money players, who invariably must light their own inner fire.This week, Pitino has been insisting that he is not playing the underdog card, while adding that in a seven-game series Louisville would have no chance against Kentucky. It was classic emotive contradiction; anyone who has ever played tennis with Pitino knows he is an absolute master of spin.It’s also the coach’s benefit of the N.C.A.A. arena: the Cardinals — who lost to Kentucky by 7 on the road this season — need only be better for 40 minutes.“Rick always believes he can win one game by getting his guys to play above and beyond,” said DiRaimo, who owned an Italian restaurant in downtown Providence before relocating to Lexington and opening another one, in partnership with the coach.They called it Bravo Pitino, and knowing how the impassioned Lexington folks worship at the Kentucky altar, DiRaimo can only imagine what they will call his old friend should he succeed where he failed in 1987, losing to a Syracuse team loaded with pro talent.He also knows that Pitino, at his core still more upstart than star, is dying to find out.'"
"'12-03-31,'0','As financial services companies have improved security over the last year, criminals have aimed at a specific part of the credit card system: the payment processors that act as a bridge between banks and retailers. Security consultants say that the sophistication of these attacks is increasing.“Hackers are well aware that these systems don’t have the same sophisticated levels of security as the banks,” said Tom Kellerman, a vice president at Trend Micro, a computer security company. “The payment processors have become their Achilles’ heel.”Bank officials said they were told by Visa and MasterCard that the breach occurred sometime from late January to late February, and included what is known as Track 1 and Track 2 data. That includes details like names, card numbers, validation codes and in some cases, customer addresses.“Thieves are after high concentrations of credit card numbers, which makes payment processors the perfect target,” said Tim Matthews, a director at Symantec, a security firm.The processors, including Global Payments, act as the plumbing from merchants to banks, authorizing millions of transactions each day.With each swipe of a credit card, the card number and other important financial information travels from the merchant to the third-party processors and then to Visa or MasterCard. The data is then forwarded to the bank that issued the card.The holy grail for hackers is the account information. The goal is to break the data’s encryption as it travels through the payment processor system, said Avivah Litan, a vice president and analyst with Gartner Research, a security firm.This is the second breach at Global Payments in the last 12 months, according to two individuals briefed on the investigations who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly. Another similar attack was disclosed by Heartland Payment Systems in 2009, a breach that began in 2007 and resulted in the exposure of data on 130 million credit cards. Heartland estimated that breach cost it $140 million in fines, settlements and legal fees.The new possible breach was reported Friday morning by a blog called Krebs on Security. Trading in Global Payments shares was halted around noon but the share price had already dropped 9.1 percent to $47.50.A spokeswoman for Global Payments declined to comment on whether hackers had struck before. In a statement on Friday afternoon, the company said it had identified “unauthorized access into a portion of its processing system,” and had asked for help from external experts in computer security and also contacted federal law enforcement. The Secret Service, which investigates credit card fraud, confirmed that it was looking into the breach.“It is reassuring that our security processes detected an intrusion,” said Paul R. Garcia, the chief executive of Global Payments. “It is crucial to understand that this incident does not involve our merchants or their relationships with their customers.”Electronic payment industry officials also said the latest data thefts were not evidence of a larger problem. “These folks work night and day to secure their systems, but they are connected to millions of merchants around the country and nothing is absolutely foolproof,” said Thomas Goldsmith, a spokesman for the Electronic Transactions Association, a trade group.MasterCard would not say how many cardholders might have been affected by the attack. The card companies also said they had alerted banks and law enforcement officials to the breach, and emphasized that their own systems had not been compromised.“We have alerted payment card issuers regarding certain MasterCard accounts that are potentially at risk,” MasterCard said in a statement. A Visa representative said that “there has been no breach of Visa systems.”Banking regulators have indicated they were also concerned about the vulnerability of third-party payment processors.“The payment processing industry has not been regulated to the degree that banks have, and that’s a gap in regulation,” said Carol R. Van Cleef, a partner at Patton Boggs, a law firm in Washington.The F.D.I.C. raised alarms about the potential vulnerability of third-party processors back in 2008. “Payment processors pose greater money laundering and fraud risk if they do not have an effective means of verifying their merchant clients’ identities and business practices,” the agency said.'"
"'12-03-31,'0','The same streets were even more crowded on Friday morning, lined with people awaiting the body’s arrival. All the businesses had shut down, and it appeared that the entire town had turned out for the funeral. Many here said there had been no show of unity like this since 1998, when Thubten Ngodup, another Tibetan man, also fatally burned himself in New Delhi and was brought here for a funeral and cremation.This time, the streets were thronged with red-robed monks and young men wearing black jackets that said “Team Tibet 08” on the back. There were elderly women fingering Buddhist rosary beads, children carrying the Tibetan flag adorned with a snow lion, and teenagers taking photographs with their cellphones.The ambulance slowly wound its way through the streets and arrived at 8:45 a.m. at the main temple, the Tsuglagkhang, which the Dalai Lama, the spiritual leader of the Tibetans, presides over. On the side of the ambulance was a banner with a photograph showing Mr. Jamphel Yeshi as a grinning, fresh-faced young man in a black-and-white-striped shirt. Next to that was an image of him racing down a street in flames. The ambulance was draped with khatas, white scarves that symbolize auspiciousness.The coffin, also covered in khatas, was carried to a white platform in the center of the temple. Mourners tossed more scarves on it. Then the crowd stood up and sang the Tibetan national anthem. Monks lit rows of candles on a table behind the coffin.“Once you see this kind of atmosphere, you feel a sort of happiness that comes out,” said Kunchok Tenzin, 31, a monk from Namgyal Monastery watching from the rear. “You feel like your body is quaking.”“I personally respect and believe in what he did,” Mr. Kunchok Tenzin added. “He sacrificed himself not just for politics, but for religion. He is one of those figures that protects Buddhism. I am one of those figures that practices Buddhism. You need the two — they go together.”The speeches began with that of Tenzin Yangzom, an official with the Tibetan Youth Congress, a group advocating Tibetan independence, who read from a note that Mr. Jamphel Yeshi had left, one that beseeched all Tibetans to join together to end Chinese oppression.Then came Dhondup Lhadar, vice president of the same group, giving an account of how Mr. Jamphel Yeshi had dropped hints of what he had planned to do in the days before the protest. He had spoken to a friend about the dozens of self-immolations that have taken place in Tibet in the last year, and he talked about Mr. Hu’s visit. He told his brother he had put all his money in his brother’s bank account, and he handed his brother a suitcase filled with his clothes.“I’d like to join the protest organized by the Tibetan Youth Congress, and maybe I won’t be coming back,” he told his brother, according to the account.The morning of the protest, Mr. Jamphel Yeshi woke early and placed rosary beads and a book written by the Dalai Lama next to a photograph of the spiritual leader in his home.The Dalai Lama was not at the ceremony, and he has said little about the self-immolations. But one of the speakers, Penpa Tsering, head of the Tibetan Parliament in exile, sought to put them in a religious perspective. “It’s not an act of violence,” he said. “The figures who took this action had pure motivation behind their actions. They sacrificed their lives no matter how painful it was, no matter how much they suffered, for the benefit of the majority of the people.”Later, he said in English, “Now the question is, how many more Tibetan lives will be lost before the Tibetan issue is resolved?”Dharamsala is a magnet for foreigners, and there were many in the crowd. One woman carried an American flag, and a man held aloft a South Korean one. Some young foreigners wore signs around their necks: “Germany, I Am With Tibet.” “U.K., I Am With Tibet.”The speeches ended at 10:15 a.m., and the mourners stood up to sing again. Young volunteers linked hands to hold back the crowd as the coffin was lifted off the platform and loaded into the ambulance. People surged forward and threw khatas on the vehicle. The ambulance, followed by a river of mourners, drove out of the temple and uphill, toward the cremation site.A thin column of smoke soon rose from the mountainside. For the second time, Mr. Jamphel Yeshi burned.'"
"'12-03-31,'0','Administration officials described the Saudis as willing and eager, at least since talks started last fall, to undercut the Iranians.One senior official who had met with the Saudi leadership, said: “There was no resistance. They are more worried about a nuclear Iran than the Israelis are.”Still officials said, the administration wanted to be sure that the Saudis were not talking a bigger game than they could deliver. The Saudis received a parade of visitors, including some from the Energy Department, to make the case that they had the technical capacity to pump out significantly more oil.But some American officials remain skeptical. That is one reason Mr. Obama left open the option of reviewing this decision every few months. “We won’t know what the Saudis can do until we test it, and we’re about to,” the official said.Worldwide demand for oil was another critical element of the equation that led to the White House decision on sanctions. Now, projections for demand are lower than expected because of the combination of rising oil prices, the and a modest slowdown in growth in China.As one official said, “No one wants to wish for slowdown, but demand may be the most important factor.”Nonetheless, the sanctions pose a serious challenge for the United States. Already, concerns over a confrontation with Iran and the loss of its oil — Iran was the third-biggest exporter of crude in 2010 — have driven oil prices up about 20 percent this year.A gallon of gas currently costs $3.92, on average, up from about $3.20 a gallon in December. The rising prices have weighed on economic confidence and cut into household budgets, a concern for an Obama administration seeking re-election.On Friday afternoon, oil prices on commodity markets closed at $103.02 a barrel, up 24 cents for the day.Moreover, the new sanctions — which effectively force countries to choose between doing business with the United States and buying oil from Iran — threaten to fray diplomatic relationships with close allies that buy some of their crude from Tehran, like South Korea.But in a conference call with reporters, senior administration officials said they were confident that they could put the sanctions in effect without damaging the global economy.Iran currently exports about 2.2 million barrels of crude oil a day, according to the economic analysis company IHS Global Insight, and other oil producers will look to make up much of that capacity, as countries buy less and less oil from Iran. A number of countries are producing more petroleum, including the United States itself, which should help to make up the gap.Most notably, Saudi Arabia, the world’s single biggest producer, has promised to pump more oil to bring prices down.“There is no rational reason why oil prices are continuing to remain at these high levels,” the Saudi oil minister, Ali Naimi, wrote in an opinion article in The Financial Times this week. “I hope by speaking out on the issue that our intentions — and capabilities — are clear,” he said. “We want to see stronger European growth and realize that reasonable crude oil prices are key to this.”By certifying that there is enough supply available, the administration is also trying to gain some leverage over Iran before a resumption of negotiations, expected on April 14.The suggestion that Saudi Arabia is prepared to make up for any lost Iranian production is intended to remove Iran’s ability to threaten a major disruption in the world oil supply if it does not cede to Western and demands to halt uranium enrichment.However, administration officials concede that it is unclear how the oil markets will react to Iranian threats even with the president’s latest certification that there is sufficient oil to fill the gap. “We just don’t know how much negotiating advantage we have gained,” said one senior administration official who has been involved in developing the policy.In a statement, , the White House press secretary, said the administration acknowledged that the oil market had become increasingly tight, with output just besting demand.“Nonetheless, there currently appears to be sufficient supply of non-Iranian oil to permit foreign countries” to cut imports, he said.American officials have also discussed a coordinated release of oil from the national strategic reserves with French and British officials.Some energy experts question whether Saudi Arabia really has enough spare capacity to make up for the loss of Iran’s oil. But the determination of the United States and Europe to combat high prices might be enough to quiet the markets.The White House “can have a very limited material impact on the size of supplies,” said David J. Rothkopf, the president of Garten Rothkopf, a Washington-based consultancy. “But they can have a much larger impact on perceptions. In this case, it’s not so much the producers as the energy traders who are moving market prices — and that’s where the White House wants to play a role.”Additionally, the White House has the ability under the law to waive the new sanctions if they threaten national security or if oil prices spurt, increasing the flow of money to Iran’s government.'"
"'12-03-31,'0','The only Western bank operating here said on Wednesday that it would be leaving. Piles of cash equaling about a quarter of Afghanistan’s annual economic output were physically carried out of Afghanistan last year. Fewer foreign companies are seeking to do business here, and those already here are downsizing and putting off new investments. And there are businessmen like Mr. Manani who already have a foot out the door, working actively toward a Plan B for life and business outside Afghanistan.Senior Afghan officials are acutely aware of it, and are alternately worried and angry. “Sometimes I hear that some businessmen are fleeing and moving their businesses to outside Afghanistan,” President said at a news conference this month. “Curses be upon such businessmen that made tons of money here and now that the Americans are leaving they flee. They can leave right now. We don’t need them.”Given the importance of trying to bolster economic independence in the overall plan for Afghanistan, the skittish responses and decreasing investment and hiring strike right at hopes that this impoverished nation, still barely on the cusp of modernity, can thrive on its own.Large companies are expressing worries about security. One of the most significant is Standard Chartered, the only big Western bank with a branch in the country, which said Wednesday that it was turning over its operations to a local Afghan bank and withdrawing mainly because of deteriorating conditions.Mohammad Qurban Haqjo, chief executive of the Afghanistan Chamber of Commerce and Industries, said the head of one of the country’s four big cellphone companies had told him that he planned to take his investments out of the country after 2014.“It is still two years to go, but we are hearing from our businesses that everybody is raising this question,” Mr. Haqjo said.Even those who are trying to stay, foreign companies in particular, have become very conservative. According to the Afghanistan Investment Support , capital spending by foreign companies newly registered in the past year, at $55 million, was the lowest rate in at least seven years, and about one-eighth the rate’s peak in 2006.According to Masuda Sultan, an Afghan-American businesswoman who grew up in , the caution is expressing itself in businesses that are downsizing work forces, for example, or holding off on new investments.“Among the people I know, there is planning going on in terms of investment decisions,” she said. “They are not packing up their bags just yet, but people are looking to diversify abroad or into other business sectors within Afghanistan.”Some of the companies that are more heavily dependent on the military and the aid economy, like construction and logistics businesses, are trying to stay put by reconfiguring toward the few areas where analysts feel Afghanistan might have growth potential, like mining or trade.But others are nervous that Afghanistan’s nebulous private sector will not be enough to fill the gap left by the United States’ military and development spending. World Bank figures back up those fears: the bank estimates that outside aid is equivalent to more than 90 percent of the country’s total economic activity, and forecasts a slowdown in growth in the coming years to 5 or 6 percent from about 9 percent, or much lower if security worsens.That is in part because, despite the billions in reconstruction and aid money poured into Afghanistan, there still is no major manufacturing or technology base that could be a driver of future prosperity. A new bottling plant on the outskirts of Kabul is trumpeted as one of the few new investment triumphs.“There is a sense that they have to change from a war economy to a postwar economy, and people definitely expect it to contract,” said Thomas Rosenstock, a lawyer, originally from New York, who helps foreign companies entering the Afghan market. “It’s uncertain how dramatic the would be.”Then there are those who are voting with their cash.Each week tens of millions of dollars — some thought to be diverted American aid or drug money — are packed into suitcases or boxes and loaded onto planes leaving Kabul International Airport for destinations like , capital flight that is increasing steadily ahead of the 2014 deadline, officials say.Noorullah Delawari, the central bank governor, recently imposed restrictions limiting the amount a passenger can take out of the country to $20,000 a trip.But the mountain of departing cash that is officially declared — about $4.6 billion last year, the same size as the Afghan government’s annual budget — may be matched by money fleeing through other airports and over borders, or seeping out through the black market, an Afghan official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity. “We really don’t know how much is being moved,” the official said.Security officials are still struggling to ensure that people passing through the V.I.P. area of the Kabul airport put their bags through machines installed a few years ago in part to keep people from sneaking cash out, the official said.For Mr. Manani, the butcher, and others like him who do not have huge amounts of capital as a safety blanket, the hopes that they can stay at home and still expand their businesses are being tempered by the need to ensure their families’ safety.His plan is rooted in an effort to start a second business in with his local Sikh business partner there, he says. That would enable him to get a long-term visa, and so a way out for his wife and five children, as well as his parents, brothers and a sister and their children, all of whom depend on him and would have to move with him, he says.“Every businessman is just thinking about how to move from here, about how to be safe,” Mr. Manani said as he stood in front of a big cooler where sides of beef and lamb were hanging. Through the doorway into another room, four workers were busily cutting and packing.He grew up in the north of Afghanistan and fought in the bitter civil war of the 1990s. There is no way he wants to relive that experience, he said.“I don’t have the energy to take the gun again and start fighting,” he said. “That’s why I am looking for a way out.”'"
"'12-03-31,'0','Her doctor, U Tin Myo Win, said in a telephone interview on Friday that Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi suffered from overwork, exhaustion, exposure to Myanmar’s extreme heat and acute motion sickness during campaign trips.“All these trips at this age — and this weather,” Dr. Tin Myo Win said. “We have to work very hard to take care of her.”After campaigning last weekend on islands in southern Myanmar, Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi vomited, could not hold down food or water and had low blood pressure, Dr. Tin Myo Win said. She was under orders to rest until her appearance on Friday.Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi had surgery in 2003 to remove what Dr. Tin Myo Win described as noncancerous growths, but her current ailments do not appear related to that operation, which the doctor described as successful.A senior party leader, U Tin Oo, said in an interview that Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi was suffering from “ordinary weakness.”“Her head is all right — perfect,” Mr. Tin Oo said. “All her organs are all right.”In her comments to reporters, Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi described the election as a modest step toward democracy. The election is “a turning point,” she said.“I don’t think I would say yet it’s a major turning point,” she continued.The election was called to fill 48 vacancies in a Parliament of more than 600 seats. (Elections for three of the seats, in the restive northern area of the country that is home to the Kachin ethnic group, have been postponed.)For the balance of power in Myanmar, though, the vote is virtually inconsequential. Even a sweep of all the seats by the opposition would not significantly weaken the ruling party’s control of both houses of Parliament.Yet the election is weighted with symbolism both for Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi personally and for the democracy movement. The last time her party competed in elections, in 1990, she was under house arrest.She said Friday that she would try to change Myanmar, formerly Burma, from the inside after years on the outside — as a dissident. A handful of opposition members in Parliament can still be powerful, she said.“Even one voice can be heard loudly all over the world in this day and age,” she said.The news conference was held at the lakeside home where she was detained for the better part of 20 years by the military junta that ruled until last March, when the military handed power to a nominally civilian government.Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi is running against a doctor in an impoverished constituency south of Yangon and will spend Saturday night there.Many “irregularities” have occurred during the past few weeks of campaigning, Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi said Friday. She said posters for her party had been defaced and members of the government had contravened the Constitution by campaigning for the ruling party. But the problems appeared minor compared with the brutality suffered by the population in recent years.Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi gave an example of a candidate for her party who “was almost injured by somebody who shot a betel nut at him.”The party handed out a list of what it said were infractions, including an accusation that a campaign rally was disrupted when a member of the ruling party “set alight a nearby haystack.”Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi denounced such acts but said the party would go ahead with the election.“Still we are determined to go forward because we think this is what our people want,” she said.In curt but eloquent English, she said the “triumph” of her grueling campaign schedule was raising awareness across the country about the meaning of democracy. “An election alone is not going to change our country,” she said. “It’s the people — the change in the spirit of the people which will change our nation.”In echoes of her writings on democracy when she was under house arrest, Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi elaborated on what she called the “revolution of the spirit.”“I mean a revolution that will help our people to overcome fear, to overcome poverty, to overcome indifference,” she said, “and to take the fate of their country into their own hands.”'"
"'12-03-31,'0','“Finally, robust firewalls have been established,” the ministers said in a statement.Announcing a large bailout fund was viewed as crucial to putting an end to speculation over the fate of the currency union prompted by the huge indebtedness of Greece and financial crises in Ireland and Portugal.But only €500 billion of the sum is fresh money and, of that, the full amount may not be available until 2014.Instead, some unused funds from an earlier, temporary bailout facility could be accessed only during a transitional period, and ministers reached the final figure of €800 billion by including €300 billion already paid to Greece, Ireland and Portugal.Some of these figures were originally meant to count against a new €500 billion fund, known as the European Stability Mechanism, or E.S.M., which goes into operation in July.The sum also is a far cry from the demands of international economic experts and of countries like France, where Finance Minister François Baroin called during the past week for a €1 trillion “nuclear” deterrent.But a push during the meeting by Olli Rehn, the European commissioner for economic and monetary affairs, and by others to agree on a more substantial firewall was quashed by the German finance minister, Wolfgang Schauble, who said that would be unacceptable to Germans.It also is unclear whether the sum is big enough to nudge donors to the International Monetary Fund, including the United States and China, to pledge more to the fund. Many economic experts and some U.S. officials had favored transferring all unused funds from the temporary facility, an amount currently totaling €240 billion, to the new permanent fund.Christine Lagarde, the managing director of the I.M.F., said the agreement in Copenhagen would “support the I.M.F.’s efforts to increase its available resources for the benefit of all our members.” But she did not say whether the agreement was sufficient for the I.M.F. to direct more of its resources to Europe.Whether the leaders of the Group of 20 countries would increase the overall global lending capacity of the I.M.F. to $1 trillion, as some reports suggest, “is yet to be seen,” said Gizem Kara, an economist with BNP Paribas in London.The stormy exit of Mr. Juncker on Friday over announcing the agreement cast an unwelcome cloud over the introduction of a bailout mechanism that is meant to be a European equivalent of the I.M.F., and that is supposed to help Europe finally turn a difficult page.The difficulties began when Ms. Fekter held an impromptu news conference Friday morning and announced that ministers had agreed on the size of the firewall. Mr. Juncker, the chairman of the Eurogroup, then hastily canceled his own scheduled news conference, blaming Ms. Fekter.“There was no point” in holding the event because “the Austrian finance minister announced it,” he said, referring to the firewall.Mr. Juncker “was furious, really furious,” said an E.U. official who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the delicacy of the matter.Speculation is widespread over who will succeed Mr. Juncker when his term as head of the Eurogroup ends in June. The president is chosen by consensus by the members of the group, which holds its next meeting in May. Ministers could make a decision before May, or afterward, in the margins of other major E.U. meetings.Decisions on several other policy-making posts, including at the European Central Bank, are far from made, as institutions try not to fill top positions with people from the same country.The €800 billion figure agreed to Friday could help to placate Germany and Finland, where there is widespread concern that a more generous backstop could lead other countries to reduce their commitments to austerity and put other European taxpayers, who would bear the bailout funds’ liabilities, at even greater risk.Earlier in the day, some ministers made clear their reservations about expanding the size of the region’s firewall to a sum approaching €1 trillion.“We are ready to increase the firewall, but €940 billion is not possible for our side,” Finance Minister Jutta Urpilainen of Finland said as she arrived at the conference. “It’s too high and now we are looking for a result which we and other countries would accept.”Ministers did agreed to capitalize the E.S.M. more quickly than previously planned by making the final instalment of five payments of €16 billion each in the first half of 2014.The meetings in Copenhagen will continue Saturday among finance ministers from the full European Union.'"
"'12-03-31,'0','TOKYO — Japan is deploying guided-missile destroyers and antiaircraft batteries with orders to shoot down a North Korean rocket if it falls toward Japanese territory, Japan’s defense minister said Friday.The move appears to ratchet up the tensions surrounding the launching of what North Korea says is a rocket carrying a satellite, but what the United States and its allies fear is actually a test of a long-range ballistic missile. North Korea appears to be readying the rocket despite international calls to cancel the launching, which now appears likely to take place between April 12 and 16.North Korea outraged Washington and its allies this month by announcing that it would launch a rocket to put a satellite into orbit in April. The United States demanded that North Korea cancel the launching, which it said would violate a United Nations Security Council resolution adopted in 2009 to prevent North Korea from developing long-range missile technology.The Japanese defense minister, Naoki Tanaka, said the orders were intended to protect Japanese lives and property if part or all of the rocket, which is expected to fly over western Japan, goes off course. North Korea has said the upper stage of the rocket will pass over Japan and land in international waters east of the Philippines.South Korea has also vowed to shoot down the rocket if it endangers South Korean territory.Mr. Tanaka said Japan took similar precautions the last time North Korea test-fired a long-range rocket over its territory, in 2009.'"
