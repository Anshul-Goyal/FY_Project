"'09-09-01,'0','Chris Connor, the great jazz singer whose lush, foggy voice and compressed emotional intensity distilled a 1950s jazz reverie of faraway longing in a sad cafe, died on Saturday in Toms River, N.J. She was 81 and lived in Toms River.The cause was cancer, her publicist, Alan Eichler, said.A singer who used little vibrato and was admired for her inventive rhythmic alterations of ballads, Ms. Connor belonged to the cool school of jazz singers that included Anita O’Day, June Christy, Chet Baker and Julie London.In her finest records, she conveyed the sound of a singer rapt in a romantic spell. Both O’Day and Christy, whom she emulated, preceded her as vocalists with the Stan Kenton band, which she joined briefly in 1953, replacing Kay Brown. Ms. Connor had earlier sung with the Claude Thornhill band.During her solo recording career, which began in 1953, Ms. Connor had only two charted hits: “I Miss You So” (1956) and “Trust In Me” (1957), both for Atlantic Records. But for jazz vocal aficionados, her signature song, “All About Ronnie,” Joe Greene’s smoldering ballad of romantic obsession, is a pop-jazz milestone of dreamy cool. Originally recorded with Kenton, she re-recorded it on Bethlehem Records after she went solo.Today, many of Ms. Connor’s 1950s and ’60s albums are regarded as pop-jazz classics. Among the strongest are three from 1956, “Chris Connor,” “I Miss You So” and “He Loves Me, He Loves Me Not,” as well as “Chris Connor Sings the George Gershwin Almanac of Song” (1957) and “A Portrait of Chris” (1960).She recorded two highly regarded albums, one for the Atlantic, the other for ABC Paramount, with the Maynard Ferguson big band.Especially during the Atlantic years, Ms. Connor worked with the best arrangers, including Ralph Burns and Jimmy Jones, and jazz players like John Lewis, Oscar Pettiford, Phil Woods, Kenny Burrell, Milt Hinton, Clark Terry and Oliver Nelson. Other songs with which she is associated include “Lush Life,” “Good Morning Heartache,” “Something to Live For,” “High on a Windy Hill,” “Round About,” Lullaby of Birdland,” “Witchcraft,” “Glad to Be Unhappy” and “Get Out of Town.”Born Mary Loutsenhizer in Kansas City, Mo., on Nov. 8, 1927, Ms. Connor studied clarinet for eight years as a child before becoming a singer in her late teens. She decided to pursue a fulltime career after her public singing debut in 1945 at the Jefferson City (Mo.) Junior College graduation was warmly received.Ms. Connor worked as a stenographer by day and sang on weekends in the Kansas City area. Then, determined to hit the big time, she moved to New York City. There she met Thornhill, who was seeking a singer to fill out his vocal group, the Snowflakes. She toured with the band on and off until late 1952.Her dream of singing with Kenton was realized when Christy heard her on a live broadcast in early 1953 and recommended her as a replacement. Within days, Ms. Connor auditioned and began touring with the band.The rigors of the road, however, took their toll, and she left after less than 5 months to go solo. She signed with Bethlehem Records, which simultaneously released two 10-inch LPs, “Chris Connor Sings Lullabys of Birdland and “Chris Connor Sings Lullabys for Lovers.” They were hugely successful.In 1956, she became one of the first white female jazz singers signed to Atlantic Records and recorded more than a dozen albums for the label. In 1963, however, when it came time to renew her contract, she decided instead to sign with her manager Monte Kay’s small label, FM. The label declared bankruptcy the following year.That unfortunate decision coincided with the rock ’n’ roll insurgence, which swept aside singers like Ms. Connor, and her career never fully recovered. She endured what she later described as a bad period that lasted until the early ’70s.Her setbacks were compounded by a worsening drinking problem, which she eventually overcame. Her 1980s comeback revealed a voice that was physically stronger than ever, but its emotional elixir was diluted. She continued to perform and to record for small labels. Her last three records, “Haunted Heart,” “I Walk With Music,” and “Everything I Love,” were released on Highnote Records, the final album in 2003.Ms. Connor is survived by her longtime partner and manager, Lori Muscarelle.'"
"'09-09-01,'0','The cacophony came from Court 16, a chorus of guttural grunts from Michelle Larcher de Brito that provided the soundtrack for her first-round match Monday at the United States Open. The sounds overpowered announcements and cheers that came from nearby courts. They drowned out the noise from airplanes flying overhead. They caused spectators to turn to one another in ear-splitting amazement.Larcher de Brito topped Mathilde Johansson of France, 1-6, 7-5, 6-1, leaving the crowd a lasting audible impression. Here she was, all of 16, thin and petite, yet loud and proud. Those noises — high-volume part grunt, part shriek, part wheeze — could not have come from her. Could they?Indeed. Of all the celebrated past and present decibel champions on the WTA Tour, a group that includes Maria Sharapova, Monica Seles and the Williams sisters, Larcher de Brito, 5 feet 5 inches, consistently ranks among the loudest.With the match under way, an experiment needed to be conducted. How far could one walk from Court 16 and still hear Larcher de Brito’s shriek show?From the walkway behind the court, past the ice cream stand and nearly to a nearby men’s room, a full 75 steps later, her grunts still resonated, albeit softly, down the corridor. And that was walking in the noisiest direction, away from the quiet of the practice courts on the other side of Court 16.'"
"'09-09-01,'0','At full-service hotels where he once was a regular, Mr. Hawrylyshen said checking in was welcoming and efficient. “There was never a line. They’d be expecting you, greet you by name.” Hopscotching to different hotels in search of low rates now means staying at places where his information is not already in the computer system.“Suddenly, checking in takes longer because they have to process your credit card and you have to fill out forms,” said Mr. Hawrylyshen, who travels one to four times a month. “It adds 10 minutes or more, sometimes up to half an hour” to his already hectic schedule.Unfortunately for travelers like Mr. Hawrylyshen, this trend show no signs of abating. According to Peter C. Yesawich, chairman and chief executive at Ypartnership, a travel marketing and research company, a quarter of the nearly 800 business travelers surveyed this year indicated that they were booking less expensive hotels.The trading down has been occurring on all levels: top executives who may have previously stayed at luxury hotels are staying at full-service hotels, while middle managers who used to stay at those properties are now switching to limited-service hotels.“If you used to stay in a full-service Sheraton, Marriott or Hilton, you may trade down to a Four Points, Courtyard by Marriott or Hilton Garden Inn,” said Al Calhoun, managing director of Jones Lang LaSalle Hotels, a real estate management and investment firm.Industry analysts say the one sector that has fared better than others is what is known in the business as “upscale” or “select-service” hotels. While the terminology may not be familiar to travelers, the brand names are likely to be; Courtyard by Marriott, Hilton Garden Inn and Four Points by Sheraton, among them.These hotels are distinguished from their full-service sister brands by a lack of restaurants, lounge areas or meeting rooms. While some hotels may have one or more of these amenities, they vary by property. By contrast, their presence is a given at full-service hotels.According to Mr. Calhoun, revenue per available room, a crucial measure of a hotel’s fiscal health, has not dropped as sharply for select-service properties as it has for other types of hotels. While room rates have softened in recent months, prices have been hit hardest at luxury and full-service chains.Data from Smith Travel Research shows that hotel room rates dropped by an average of 8.1 percent in the first four months of the year, compared with the same period in 2008, with rates at luxury hotels falling by 13.9 percent and rates at select-service hotels declining 8.3 percent.Select-service hotels are also holding their own in occupancy. Occupancy rates are expected to fall across all hotel levels in 2009 because of the recession’s impact on business and leisure travel. However, Robert Mandelbaum, director of research information services at the consulting firm PKF Hospitality Research, said select-service hotels would end the year with less of a drop than most other brands.While overall occupancy is expected to drop by 5.6 percent and luxury hotel occupancy by 8.3 percent, select-service occupancy is projected to end the year with a much smaller 3.7 percent decline.This relative robustness could prove to be a double-edged sword in the coming months, though. Hotel investors and developers are increasingly flocking to these types of properties because the select-service hotels are viewed as a relatively safe haven during a time of overall distress for the industry.“They’re cheaper to build, they’re cheaper to maintain and they’re cheaper to operate,” said David Loeb, a real estate analyst at Robert W. Baird & Company. He said new hotels were opening at a rapid rate and would most likely add to the problem of too many rooms and not enough travelers to fill them.“The impact of all of this new supply is a really bloody market-share war,” he said. “The operators of these hotels are trying really hard to achieve or keep market share, and they’re doing that by lowering prices.”While this is bad news for hotel operators, it is a silver lining for road warriors and corporate travel managers trying to hold the line on lodging expenses in a tough economy.'"
"'09-09-01,'0','The N.H.L. Players’ Association dismissed its executive director, Paul Kelly, on Monday, a move that forces the union to seek its fourth leader in four years.The union’s general counsel, Ian Penny, was named the interim executive director. According to Basil E. Hargrove, the union’s ombudsman, Penny will hold the post until no later than Dec. 31. The N.H.L.’s collective bargaining agreement expires after the 2010-11 season.Kelly’s unexpected dismissal took place during a meeting of the union’s executive board, which began Sunday night in Chicago. Kelly went before the board about 3 a.m. Monday and was informed of his ouster, a union official said. Kelly had no public comment Monday.The union released a statement from the executive board, which consists of player representatives from each of the league’s 30 teams, saying, “After a full review of the overall health of the office and the association, it became clear Paul Kelly was not the right individual for the executive director’s role going forward.”No specific reason was given, but Hargrove said a “whole host of issues” that had been “festering” for more than six months led to the dismissal.'"
"'09-09-01,'0','Chiara Volpato is to be commended for condemning Umberto Bossi, the noxiously xenophobic leader of the Northern League Party. And she quite correctly castigates the Vatican for its undue interference in the Italian body politic.But Ms. Volpato’s screed against Italy’s “famously patriarchal culture” has the whiff of hyperbole. Yes, the glass ceiling in “il bel paese” needs more full-fledged cracks and fewer hairline fissures. But Silvio Berlusconi’s silly flirtations are not the issue. Nor is anti-feminism a national character flaw.Italy’s low birthrate — like Spain’s, Japan’s and Germany’s — is a choice. The reproductive rights of women in China are well-nigh nonexistent. Women in Saudi Arabia live in a state akin to apartheid.Ironically, in “The Emancipation of Women in Ancient Rome,” Roger Vigneron and Jean-François Gerkens explain how the Italians of antiquity forged a polity where “the rule of juridical equality was the duty to be pursued.” According to the authors, the Romans believed men and women to be inherently equal.I am heartened to hear that more and more Italian women are fighting the misogyny and racism that reign in Italy. I am, however, surprised that Chiara Volpato cites a petition addressed to “the first ladies” of countries participating in the G-8 as evidence of resistance to the status quo.Was the petition also sent to Angela Merkel’s husband? Why was it not addressed to the men and women who head the G-8 states?'"

"'09-09-01,'0','Judge Núñez, who presides over the case from a cramped office in the town of Lago Agrio in Ecuador, could not be reached for comment on Monday.The recordings, which Chevron placed on its Web site, are the latest twist in a 16-year legal battle over oil contamination of jungle areas in northern Ecuador. Mr. Correa, a left-wing economist who rose from obscurity to become Ecuador’s strongest president in recent memory, has repeatedly sided with the plaintiffs in the case, prompting a fierce lobbying effort by Chevron in Washington to strip Ecuador of American trade preferences.That effort failed in June when the Obama administration, seizing a chance to improve ties with Mr. Correa, allowed the preferences to continue. But the release of the recordings will focus more scrutiny on Mr. Correa, who has come under pressure over his clashes with the media and accusations of corruption involving another family member, his brother Fabricio Correa, a prominent businessman.Alexis Mera, a legal adviser to the president, dismissed the recordings as “approaching the level of defamatory libel.” He said Chevron was benefiting from the crime of intercepting conversations without authorization, reflecting “a terrible legal strategy.”Steven Donziger, a lawyer representing the group of Ecuadorans who are suing Chevron, contending that they had been harmed by the oil contamination, said: “I suspect this is a Chevron sting operation; there needs to be an investigation into Chevron’s role in this as much as the judge’s. I find it awfully odd that these individuals would secretly film meetings using James Bond devices like a spy watch and a spy pen.“At the end of the day this will not affect the underlying case,” Mr. Donziger said, “other than it might cause a short delay if the judge needs to be replaced.”Chevron said it had obtained the recordings from Diego Borja, an Ecuadoran who once worked as a logistics contractor for the company. The company said Mr. Borja had been working with an American businessman, Wayne Hansen, to secure water treatment contracts. Chevron said that neither man had been paid for the recordings, but that the company paid for Mr. Borja and his family to leave Ecuador because of concern about his safety.“I’d like to think he brought them to us out of respect for our company and concern for what seemed to be transpiring here,” Charles James, an executive vice president of Chevron, said of the recordings in a telephone interview. “We think this information absolutely disqualifies the judge and nullifies anything that he has ever done in this case.”In one of the recordings made in June, the political operative, Patricio García, who identified himself as an official in Mr. Correa’s political party, referred to $3 million in bribes to be split equally among the judge, the presidency and the plaintiffs in the lawsuit. Mr. Correa’s party, Mr. García said, would receive the $1 million payment on behalf of the plaintiffs.In the same meeting, Mr. García told Mr. Borja how to approach Ms. Correa, the president’s sister, about the bribe. “Tell Pierina clearly, ‘Madam Pierina, what we came to do beyond anything else is to participate, participate in the remediation. That’s why I want to make you part of this,’ “ he said.The recordings do not indicate whether Ms. Correa was aware of the efforts to include her in a bribery scheme. Nor is there confirmation that Mr. García was in fact in contact with her.Secret recordings of closed-door meetings have become a common feature of Ecuadoran politics. Mr. Correa, furious over the recent airing of a recording of a private conversation in his office with a cabinet minister and a member of congress, said he would request the shutdown of the television network that broadcast the recording.“This is an attack on national security,” he said.But while Mr. Correa takes such recordings seriously, it is not clear if the people whose conversations about contract bribes were recorded by Mr. Borja grasped the complexity of the Chevron lawsuit. For instance, appeals by Chevron could delay for years the payment of damages that could be used for water cleanup contracts.Still, the recordings offered a glimpse into the murky world of Ecuadoran politics and business. In another reference to Ms. Correa’s ability to ensure that the contracts would be forthcoming, Mr. García said, “Pierina knows absolutely everything.”He told Mr. Borja of a conversation he said he had with Ms. Correa, according to a transcript. “So she says: ‘Patricio, I just have to tell Rafael this one little thing, nothing else. Nothing else,’ “ he said.Chevron said the assertion should be investigated.'"
"'09-09-01,'0','The division has been at the center of a number of controversies over the decades, serving as a proxy for disputes between liberals and conservatives in matters like school busing and affirmative action. When the Nixon administration took office, it sought to delay school desegregation plans reached under former President . The Reagan administration dropped the division’s policy of opposing -exempt status for racially discriminatory private schools. And former President withdrew his first nominee to lead the division, , after her writings about racial quotas were criticized.But such dust-ups were minor when compared with sweeping changes at the division under the Bush administration, longtime career civil rights lawyers say.Now the changes that Mr. Holder is pushing through have led some conservatives, still stinging from accusations that the Bush appointees “politicized” the unit, to start throwing the same charge back at ’s team.The agency’s critics cite the downsizing of a voter intimidation case involving the New Black Panther Party, an investigation into whether an sheriff’s enforcement of laws has discriminated against Hispanics, and the recent blocking of a new rule requiring voters to prove their citizenship. (Under the Bush administration, the division had signed off on a similar law requiring Georgia voters to furnish photographic identification, rejecting criticism that legitimate minority voters are disproportionately more likely not to have driver’s licenses or passports.)Among the critics, Hans von Spakovsky, a former key Bush-era official at the division, has accused the Obama team of “nakedly political” maneuvers.Tracy Schmaler, a Justice Department spokeswoman, rejected such criticism, saying those cases were decided “based on the facts and the law.”Under the Bush administration, the agency shifted away from its traditional core focus on accusations of racial discrimination, channeling resources into areas like religious discrimination and human trafficking.Department officials are working to avoid unleashing potential controversies as they rebuild the division’s more traditional efforts on behalf of minorities.They are not planning to dismantle the new initiatives, rather to hire enough additional lawyers to do everything. The administration’s fiscal year 2010 budget request includes an increase of about $22 million for the division, an 18 percent increase from the 2009 budget. Other changes are already apparent.The division has filed about 10 “friend of the court” briefs in private discrimination-related lawsuits since Mr. Obama’s , a practice that had dwindled in the previous administration.In July, moreover, the division’s acting head, Loretta King, sent a memorandum to every federal agency urging more aggressive enforcement of regulations that forbid recipients of taxpayer money from policies that have a disparate impact on minorities.The division has also lifted Bush-era rules that some career staff members saw as micromanagement or impediments, like restrictions on internal communications and a ban on front-line career lawyers’ making recommendations on whether to approve proposed changes to election laws.Other changes from the Bush years may be harder to roll back. The division’s downgrading of the New Black Panther Party charges, which were filed in the final days of the Bush administration, has had rippling consequences. It apparently prompted Senate Republicans to put a hold on President Obama’s nominee to lead the division as assistant attorney general for civil rights, Thomas Perez.The delay in Mr. Perez’s arrival, in turn, is stalling plans to review section managers installed by the Bush team, including several regarded with suspicion by civil rights advocacy groups. Under federal law, top-level career officials may not be transferred to other positions for the first 120 days after a new agency head is confirmed.Bush-era changes to the division’s permanent rank may also have lingering effects. From 2003 to 2007, Bush political appointees blocked liberals from career jobs and promotions, which they steered to fellow conservatives, whom one such official privately described as “real Americans,” a department inspector general report found. The practice, which no previous administration had done, violated civil service laws, it said.As morale plunged among veterans, turnover accelerated. The Obama ’s confidential report on the division, obtained by , says 236 civil rights lawyers left from 2003 to 2007. (The division has about 350 lawyers.)Many of their replacements had scant civil rights experience and were graduates of lower-ranked law schools. The transition report says the era of hiring such “inexperienced or poorly qualified” lawyers — who are now themselves protected by civil service laws — has left lasting damage.“While some of the political hires have performed competently and a number of others have left, the net effect of the politicized hiring process and the brain drain is an attorney work force largely ill-equipped to handle the complex, big-impact litigation that should comprise a significant part” of the division’s docket, the transition report said.At the end of the Bush administration, the attorney general at the time, , began to make changes intended to reduce political influence over entry-level career lawyer hiring. The Civil Rights Division is now seeking to expand those changes.It is developing a new hiring policy under which panels of career employees — not political appointees — would decide both whom to hire and to promote for positions from interns to veteran lawyers. The policy could be completed as early as this month.“We wanted to create a very transparent policy that will stand the test of time and ensure that we hire the best and brightest,” said Mark Kappelhoff, a longtime civil rights lawyer who is the division’s acting principal deputy assistant attorney general.Some conservatives are skeptical that such a policy will keep politics out of hiring, however. Robert Driscoll, a division political appointee from 2001 to 2003, said career civil rights lawyers are “overwhelmingly left-leaning” and will favor liberals.“If you are the Obama administration and you allow the career staff to do all the hiring, you will get the same people you would probably get if you did it yourself,” he said. “In some ways, it’s a masterstroke by them.”Mr. Holder has elsewhere called for social changes with civil rights overtones, like the passage of a federal hate-crimes law, the elimination of the sentencing disparity between crack and powder cocaine and greater financing for indigent defense.By contrast, he described his Civil Rights Division efforts as more restoration than change. The recent moves, he argued, are a return to its basic approach under presidents of both parties — despite some policy shifts between Republican and Democratic administrations — before the “sea change” and “aberration” of the Bush years.“Of course there are going to be critics,” Mr. Holder said. But, he argued, “any objective observer” would see the recent approach as consistent with “the historical mission of the division, not straying into some kind of liberal orthodoxy. It really is just a function of enforcing the statutes.”'"

Company executives said the deal would involve 17 brands. Procter & Gamble will capitalize on the Olympics’ appeal to women by running television advertisements for its beauty brands — including Olay, Pantene and Secret — during the Games. Olympic logos will appear on packaging and in-store displays to promote other products, like Charmin, Febreze and Scope.Consumer research has shown that the Olympics appeal particularly to women, teenagers and adults ages 18 to 34, said Kirk Perry, vice president for North America at Procter & Gamble. “That encompasses our consumer base,” he said Monday in a telephone interview. “It connects at every income level. It is such an iconic and important event.”Officials at Procter & Gamble and the U.S.O.C. declined to specify how much the agreement was worth, but Lisa Baird, the chief marketing officer at the U.S.O.C., said, “It’s a very significant sponsorship for us.”Baird said Procter & Gamble had signed on as a partner, the highest level of engagement on the U.S.O.C.’s roster of sponsors.

"'09-09-01,'0','MOSCOW  Russia’s prime minister, Vladimir V. Putin, published a lengthy article Monday characterizing the Nazi-Soviet pact to divide Poland at the outset of World War II in 1939 as immoral, but he stressed that it was just one of a series of such deals that countries struck with the Nazis at that time.Mr. Putin called the nonaggression pact, which included secret amendments defining spheres of influence in Eastern Europe, “analogous” to the agreement by Britain and France a year earlier at Munich to accede to the German invasion of Czechoslovakia.The prime minister released his historical interpretation just before a scheduled visit to Poland on Tuesday for a commemoration of the start of World War II, 70 years ago this week.The pact  which was followed by German and Soviet invasions of Poland  remains a source of anger there, and the article heightened expectations of what Mr. Putin would say during his visit.Ria Novosti, an official Russian news agency, reported that Mr. Putin would use the trip to counter what the Russians call efforts by Eastern Europeans to recast the causes and lessons of World War II. Russia looks upon the war as a searing event in its history, one in which, by some estimates, 25 million Soviet citizens died.Mr. Putin is also expected to discuss a current source of tensions  the possibility that the United States will deploy interceptor missiles in Poland  with Poland’s prime minister, Donald Tusk.In his article, Mr. Putin wrote that he was compelled to discuss the pact, named Molotov-Ribbentrop for the Soviet and Nazi foreign ministers who negotiated the accord, because it was being cited today by countries who have traced their postwar Soviet occupation to this agreement.“It is indicative that history is often slanted by those who actually apply double standards in modern politics,” he wrote.The article, published in the Polish newspaper Gazeta Wyborcza and posted in Russian on the Russian government Web site, did not backtrack on earlier Russian condemnations of the pact or apologies for the subsequent massacre of Polish officers at Katyn Forest.But it did highlight a theme that has played on Russian state television in recent weeks: that even Poland was complicit in making deals with the Nazis. The article notes that the Polish Army occupied two provinces of Czechoslovakia at the same time the German Army invaded that country following the Munich agreement with France and Britain in 1938.Mr. Putin argues that the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact was inevitable after the Western Allies had acceded to the invasion of Czechoslovakia.He called that an effort by the West to “ ‘buy off’ Hitler and redirect his aggression to the east.”Stalin’s government, Mr. Putin wrote, was impelled to sign the agreement because it was facing aggression in the east from Japan and did not want war on two fronts.Mr. Putin did not mention that the Nazi-Soviet pact also restored a portion of the Russian empire lost after World War I and coveted by Stalin.'"
"'09-09-01,'0','That, said Gabriel M. Goldstein, the museum’s associate director of exhibitions, strongly suggests the hoard was buried in 1349, the year the plague reached Erfurt.“Why put such a huge investment portfolio in the ground and leave it for 700 years?” he asked. “There was a major uprising against Erfurt’s Jews — records say 100 or 1,000 were killed. Seemingly, whoever hid it died and never came back.”Dr. Martin J. Blaser, a historian who is chairman of medicine at New York University’s medical school, offers an intriguing hypothesis for why Jews became scapegoats in the Black Death: they were largely spared, in comparison with other groups, because grain was removed from their houses for Passover, discouraging the rats that spread the disease. The plague peaked in spring, around Passover.But in every pandemic, the chain of causation is intricate. The historian William H. McNeill, author of “Plagues and Peoples,” suggests that ultimate blame may rest with Möngke Khan, grandson of Genghis, who in 1252 sent his armies as far south as present-day Burma, putting them in contact with rodents whose fleas played host to Yersinia pestis, the plague bacillus. After Yersinia returned with them to the flea-bitten marmots of the Eurasian steppes, it began creeping through the rodent burrows lining Mongol caravan routes, which stretched as far west as the Black Sea. That’s where plague-ridden rats boarded ships in the besieged Crimean port of Kaffa in 1346, taking it to Europe.But that lets off the hook the Indian or Egyptian sailors who had presumably first moved the wild black rat out of India 1,000 years earlier. And then, whom in prehistory does one blame for first carrying Yersinia north from its original home in the Great Lakes region of Africa?It is not uncommon for ethnic groups to have religious or cultural customs that protect against disease — but whether it was originally intended to do that or not is often lost in time.Manchurian nomads, Dr. McNeill said, avoided plague because they believed marmots harbored the souls of their ancestors, so it was taboo to trap them, although shooting them was permitted. Butin the early 20th century, trapping by immigrants from China contributed to plague outbreaks.And Tamils from India working as plantation laborers in Malaysia may have had less malaria and dengue than their Malay and Chinese co-workers did because they never stored water near their houses, leaving mosquitoes no place to breed.The most visible aspect of blame, of course, is what name a disease gets. The World Health Organization has struggled mightily to avoid the ethnic monikers given the Spanish, Hong Kong and Asian flus, instructing its representatives to shift from “swine flu” to “H1N1” to “A (H1N1) S-O.I.V.” (the last four initials stand for “swine-origin influenza virus”) to, recently, “Pandemic (H1N1) 2009.”Headline writers have rebelled, and ignored them.Dr. Mirta Roses, director of the Pan American Health Organization, said that in the pandemic’s early days, she fought suggestions that it be named the Mexican flu or the Veracruz flu or the La Gloria flu after the country, state and town where it was discovered.“We try to avoid demonizing anyone and to keep the focus on the virus,” she said. “It helps reduce the level of panic and aggression.”When Dr. Roses was a girl, growing up in a small town in Argentina, her neighbors blamed city dwellers for polio. One summer, families took turns with the local police staffing roadblocks to turn back buses from the capital.“No one wanted the people from Buenos Aires,” she said, “because they were bringing polio.” (There was some logic in it. Polio, an intestinal virus, peaks in summer, and is more common in cities with overflowing sewers than in rural areas with outhouses.)“It wasn’t until I grew up that I learned that that was no way to fight it,” she said. “It was vaccinating 99 percent of the children that stopped polio.”By the old naming conventions, the 1918 Spanish flu probably ought to be known as the Kansas flu. According to “The Great Influenza: The Epic Story of the Deadliest Plague in History,” John M. Barry’s history of the epidemic, the first identifiable cases arose in Haskell County, in Kansas. They soon spread to Fort Riley, from there to other military bases, and then to Europe in troop ships. France, Germany and Britain had war censors controlling news reports; Spain did not. Spain got the blame.Most human diseases originate in animals. While culling animals sometimes makes sense as a public health measure — for example, culling chickens to stop an outbreak H5N1 avian flu — animals are also sometimes “punished” pointlessly. In May, the Egyptian government slaughtered thousands of pigs belonging to the Coptic Christian minority, despite international protests that doing so was racist against Copts and medically pointless because the disease was already in people. When the swine flu arrived anyway — in a 12-year-old American girl, the first confirmed case — the government vowed to hunt down the last few pigs hidden by poor families and kill them on the spot.In Afghanistan, Khanzir, the country’s only pig, a curiosity in the Kabul Zoo, was quarantined to keep him away from the goats and deer he had formerly eaten with.And during the spread of the avian flu around Asia, Thailand’s government shot open-billed storks in its cities and chopped down the trees they nested in, even though the flu had not been found in a single stork.Though the truth is that diseases are so complex that pointing blame is useless, simply deflecting blame may be more efficient.During the Black Death, Pope Clement VI issued an edict, or bull, saying Jews were not at fault. He did not, of course, blaspheme by blaming God. Nor did he blame mankind’s sins. That would have comforted the Flagellants, the self-whipping sect who were the bull’s real target; they often led the mobs attacking both Jews and the corrupt church hierarchy, and were considered heretics. Nor did it blame Möngke Khan or Yersinia pestis. It would be 500 years until the “germ theory” of disease developed.No, the pope picked a target particularly tough to take revenge upon: a misalignment of Mars, Jupiter and Saturn.'"
"'09-09-01,'0','After you’ve grown tired of intellectual engagement and civil discourse, the motion picture industry is making sure there will be plenty of gun-toting action heroes populating the cineplexes when you want to switch your brain to the off position. Variety reported that a fifth installment in Sylvester Stallone’s long-running “Rambo” series has been given the green light by the studios Nu Image and Millennium Films. The new film will be directed by Mr. Stallone, above, who will again star as the one-man killing machine John Rambo, who will fight human traffickers and drug lords while trying to rescue a kidnapped girl. The previous “Rambo” movie, released last year, earned $42 million in domestic ticket sales and $113 million overseas. In addition, The Hollywood Reporter said Columbia Pictures had hired Peter Craig to write a third installment of “Bad Boys,” the action movie series that has starred Will Smith and Martin Lawrence as a pair of mismatched Miami detectives. The report said that the actors were willing to reunite with the series director Michael Bay (“Transformers”) and producer Jerry Bruckheimer, but that no deal to bring them together had yet been struck.'"
"'09-09-01,'0','Business activity in the United States rose more than forecast in August, adding to signs the economy is improving.The Institute for Supply Management-Chicago said Monday that its business barometer increased to 50, the highest level since September 2008, from 43.4 in July. Fifty is the dividing line between contraction and expansion.Automakers are likely to be at the epicenter of a rebound in manufacturing in coming months as assembly lines speed up after the government’s cash-for-clunkers plan left showrooms bare. Increasing demand from overseas and a record reduction in inventories mean that an increase in factory orders and production may last for much of the rest of the year.It’s “a manufacturing-led recovery,” said Robert Stein, a senior economist at First Trust Advisors of Wheaton, Ill. “Much of this is probably related to the revival in auto production over the past month or so.”Economists surveyed by Bloomberg News had forecast the index would rise to 48, according to the median of 53 projections. Estimates ranged from 46 to 52.5.Economists watch the Chicago index for an early reading on the outlook for overall manufacturing, which makes up about 12 percent of the economy. The Institute for Supply Management is scheduled to release its August factory report on Tuesday. According to a Bloomberg survey, that measure will show expansion for the first time since January 2008.The Chicago report’s orders gauge climbed to 52.5, the highest level in a year, from 48 in July, and the production index rose to 52.9, from 43.3.'"
"'09-09-01,'0','Anthony Moseley, the director of the show and the executive artistic director of Collaboraction, said that except for a woman who threw down her ticket stubs in disgust and some complaints about profanity, the reasons given were never explicit.“I don’t think anybody got more specific than they didn’t like it, or they weren’t satisfied,” he said.The program, devised as a way to attract new audiences and to create buzz for the production, caused debate in Chicago, especially in the blogosphere. Chris Jones, the theater critic for The Chicago Tribune, wrote in his blog (on Chicagotribune.com) that this idea should die “a quick death” because “art is not a light fixture.”Still, Mr. Moseley said that the play was better attended than many of the company’s past productions, and many audience members he spoke to said the refund offer influenced their decision to attend.Richard Cahan, a program officer at the Driehaus foundation, said several people he’d heard from were “aghast” at the idea of a money-back guarantee or what he called “the commodification of the theatergoing experience.”“There are people who believe that theater is about supporting art,” he said. “It’s not like a tomato that’s spoiled, and you have to take it back to the store. On the other hand, it’s not given away for free, so in that sense it is a commodity.” But he added: “The recession has made it more difficult for theater organizations to take chances. One bad play can sink a theater.”The idea behind this experiment, he said, was to encourage theaters and theatergoers to take some of those chances.Mr. Moseley, the director, said, “We have to look at ways to change the model because philanthropic giving is just not there, especially for small companies trying to make the work of tomorrow.”According to the Broadway League, the national trade association, there is no industry standard for exchanges or refunds for tickets on Broadway; decisions are made at the discretion of the management. Off Broadway theater companies in New York, including the Public, may offer refunds if an above-the-title star is out, or if a patron has to leave during a show because of illness — but “I didn’t like it” is not going to get audience members their money back.The producer Jeffrey Richards, who is bringing Tracy Letts’s play “Superior Donuts” from the Steppenwolf Theater in Chicago to Broadway this fall, called the policy “interesting” but “not viable.”“I think a person takes risks when they go and see entertainment, whether it’s a play or ballet or a movie or opera,” he said. “You can send back something if it isn’t cooked properly at a restaurant, but if you don’t like something, and you’ve already digested it, you can’t get your money back.”George Forbes, the president of the League of Off-Broadway Theaters and Producers, agreed, saying that theaters were “not in the business of providing free trials.” He suggested that a more sustainable model for foundations and theater companies could be found at the Signature Theater Company in New York, where, through an initiative from Time Warner, all tickets to the regular run of a show are just $20.“There’s no guarantee that you’ll like the show, but there is a guarantee that the price is incredibly low,” Mr. Forbes said.A more sympathetic ear was lent by the producer Ken Davenport, who said he had given a “handful” of refunds in response to an e-mail promotion that offered money back on select tickets to “Altar Boyz” Off Broadway.“We’re one of the most competitive and cluttered markets for theater,” he said. “You have to find a way to stand out. The consumer is weary of taking a risk, so anything I can do to reduce that risk is a benefit. I’m confident in my production in the first place.”Mr. Moseley, who has a background in finance, said he considered the refund policy a success, and one that his company would consider doing again in the future, with a few tweaks.The refund idea isn’t new. In 1993 the producers of the Broadway flop “Ain’t Broadway Grand” took out a newspaper ad offering refunds at intermission to any patrons who didn’t like the show enough to stay for the second act.Suggesting that nothing in life is truly free, seven people were turned down, it was reported at the time, because they had bought discount tickets.'"
"'09-09-01,'0','“The decision to retire was Scott’s,” Mr. McNerney said, adding that Mr. Carson felt that, with the new schedule, he would be “giving his successor a clear path forward on the program.”Scott Hamilton, managing director of the Leeham Company, an aviation consulting firm, said he believed that Mr. Carson had been planning to step down for some time. Mr. Hamilton said Mr. Carson told him at the Paris air show in June that he intended to retire once both the 787 and 747-8, an updated version of the jumbo jet that is also expected to fly later this year, completed their first flights.Mr. McNerney praised Mr. Albaugh as one of the company’s most experienced executives. He also said that Mr. Albaugh, an engineer who has headed Boeing’s military, space and related businesses since 2002, “is a technical guy himself.”Mr. Albaugh holds bachelor’s degrees in mathematics and physics from Willamette University, and a master’s degree in civil engineering from Columbia. He will soon relocate to the Seattle area.Mr. Albaugh “has a deep appreciation for the kind of oversight we need to blend into our development efforts here,” Mr. McNerney said.Mr. Carson had been credited with reviving sales of commercial aircraft before the recession hit. But the 787 Dreamliner, lighter and more fuel-efficient than other airplanes, has been plagued by delays stemming from supply problems, a labor strike, parts shortages and structural flaws. It is Boeing’s first major new airplane in a decade and the most popular program in the company’s history, with more than 800 advance orders.But its first test flight is more than two years behind schedule. And the plane, which will make extensive use of lightweight plastic composite in place of aluminum, was originally planned for delivery in May 2008.Mr. Albaugh has been at Boeing for 34 years. While he led the company’s military and space businesses, the unit’s revenue grew to $34 billion, from $25 billion, the company said, though its revenue flattened out as Pentagon spending peaked.During the last two years, Boeing transferred other executives from its military business into top management roles on the Dreamliner project as it tried to get it back on track.'"
"'09-09-01,'0','She retired in 2007, nagged by chronic injuries and the desire to start a family with her husband, Brian Lynch. Now that their daughter, Jada, is 18 months old, Clijsters decided a few months ago it was time for another try.Federer arrived here coming off victories in the last two Grand Slam events, the French Open and Wimbledon, and with new twin daughters in tow. They were born in late July, with his wife, Mirka, doing the hard part and Federer playing the support role. He talks glowingly about combining fatherhood with his career, which did not miss a beat.Britton took a service game off Federer in the second and third sets, but Federer broke back immediately both times and turned the challenge into something only a little more than a nuisance. The last time Federer was beaten in the Open was by David Nalbandian in a fourth-round match in 2003. Britton was unlikely to be the next one to do it. He won the N.C.A.A. singles title in the spring as an unseeded freshman at the University of Mississippi. He signed a pro contract this summer.“My goal was not to get crushed, and make it interesting for a little while out there,” Britton said. “It was fun for a little while.”Now 26, Clijsters, who is from Belgium, has many supporters here, and Open officials were eager to give her a wild card. She was the 2005 champion, a well-liked personality in a women’s game that has been wanting for more of those since she stepped away. And she gives the tournament a comeback story to follow, whether she considers it one or not.“Little more nervous than usual,” Clijsters said. “It’s a very special court to me, but I really enjoyed it. I felt really good out there.”Her match was the first of the day, and of the tournament, and Clijsters was greeted by a crowd of 2,000 or so when she stepped onto the court into swirling breezes. The crowd grew as she dominated the match, which took 58 minutes, as did her confidence.She said the experience brought back a flood of good memories of her “first” career here, where she won her only Grand Slam title.“Obviously, the situation was a lot different then, but you kind of get the whole feeling for it again,” Clijsters said. “I remember just driving up here this morning, just seeing the court and everything. The same memories come back. But it’s nice. I mean, I’m glad that I have those memories.”Clijsters beat four top-20 players in the two tournaments she entered this summer, and her two losses came to No. 1 Dinara Safina and to No. 4 Jelena Jankovic. Because she is a wild card, she is unseeded. Up next is 14th-seeded Marion Bartoli of France, whom Clijsters beat in straight sets in the first round of the Cincinnati Open in early August.Perhaps the most entertaining match of the day came in Louis Armstrong Stadium when John Isner outlasted Victor Hanescu of Romania, the No. 28 seed, 6-1, 7-6 (14), 7-6 (5). Isner, a big-serving American, made a splash here two years ago when he was just out of college, advancing to the third round and taking a set from Federer with the Ashe Stadium crowd cheering wildly for him.This match was nowhere near that magnitude, but was a challenge for Isner nonetheless. He is bouncing back from a bout with mononucleosis. He was taxed by the 30-point tie breaker but fought off 10 set points by Hanescu to win it on an excellent serve-and-volley play.Serena Williams, the No. 2 seed, made quick work of her first-round match against her fellow American Alexa Glatch in a 6-4, 6-1 victory on the Ashe Stadium court. The men’s No. 12 seed, Robin Soderling of Sweden, a French Open finalist this year, needed four sets to beat Albert Montañés of Spain, 6-1, 3-6, 6-1, 6-4. The No. 8 seed, Nikolay Davydenko of Russia, won, 6-3, 6-4, 7-5, over Dieter Kindlmann of Germany.'"
"'09-09-01,'0','A new study comparing death rates of men and women after heart attacks and unstable angina finds that women are almost twice as likely to die within 30 days. But they tend to be older, to have complicating illnesses and to show different disease patterns.Some 9.6 percent of women died within a month of a heart attack or unstable angina, compared with 5.3 percent of men. But the differences between the patients’ characteristics explained most of the gap, said the paper’s first author, Dr. Jeffrey S. Berger, an assistant professor of medicine and surgery at New York University School of Medicine.The study, published Aug. 26 in The Journal of the American Medical Association, examined the cases of more than 130,000 patients from several countries. The researchers had access to clinical information about women that similar studies had lacked.“If you had a 61-year-old woman with hypertension, cholesterol and diabetes, and a 61-year-old man with hypertension, high cholesterol and diabetes, and both have acute coronary syndrome, you would expect the mortality to be the same  and it is,” Dr. Berger said. But he added: “The women are not going to be like the men. They’re going to be older, have more co-morbidities”  other diseases that complicate their heart condition  “and they are going to present differently.”'"
"'09-09-01,'0','PARIS — The decline in prices in the euro zone moderated in August, the European Union statistics agency Eurostat said Monday, further evidence that the downturn might be easing.In a preliminary release, the agency said consumer price inflation in August in the 16 countries that use the euro was negative, for the third month. Prices in the month shrank 0.2 percent from a year earlier, after a revised 0.7 percent drop in July.No breakdown of the data was provided, but economists said higher oil and energy prices this summer and slightly stronger economic activity helped slow the decline. The price of benchmark crude oil futures has moderated from a record high of about $145 a barrel last July to around $71 on Monday.While officials say they do not expect inflation to be a concern in the months ahead, there was some evidence of a pickup in price pressures in Italy, where consumer prices rose 0.3 percent from a month earlier and 0.2 percent from a year earlier, the national statistics institute, Istat, said Monday in Rome.The governing council of the European Central Bank will meet Thursday in Frankfurt to discuss interest rates; it is expected to leave its policy unchanged.“With the inflation rate set to remain dampened for the foreseeable future and the credit downturn in full swing, we see a strong case for a steady refi rate throughout 2010,” said Tullia Bucco, an economist at UniCredit Markets & Investment Banking in Milan. Economists at Barclays Capital expect inflation to rise in November.'"
"'09-09-01,'0','The Treasury’s 10-year note rose 13/32, to 101 29/32. The yield fell to 3.40 percent, from 3.45 percent late Friday.Announcements of two corporate mergers on Monday, meanwhile, showed that deal-making was slowly coming back.The Walt Disney Company said that it would pay $4 billion to buy Marvel Entertainment and its stable of superheroes, including Spider-Man, the Hulk and Iron Man. Shares of Disney slipped 3 percent, to $26.04, while Marvel surged 25.2 percent, to $48.37.Separately, the oil field services provider Baker Hughes said it was acquiring BJ Services, another oil services company, for $5.5 billion in cash and stock.This week, investors in the United States will pay close attention to the government’s monthly employment report to see whether the rate of job losses is tapering off. Another closely watched gauge will be whether businesses are asking employees to work longer weeks. Fewer job losses and longer work weeks would be strong signs the recession was ending.Automakers will also report their August sales figures on Tuesday, offering a window into the impact of the government’s cash-for-clunkers automobile rebate program.In Asia, the hard-charging Shanghai composite index has outpaced many of the world’s other exchanges, gaining 90 percent earlier this year. But it plunged 6.74 percent on Monday to close out August with a drop of 21.8 percent, the worst performance for the month among major markets.Monday’s fall, coupled with a drop of nearly 3 percent on Friday, made for “a huge, huge decline,” said Dariusz Kowalczyk, chief investment strategist at SJS Markets in Hong Kong.“It has brought the index into bear market territory,” he said. “There’s mounting concern over liquidity in the market. This is a big development.”Although China’s markets are largely closed to foreign investors, movements in Chinese shares have increasingly been rippling into other markets.In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng index fell 1.9 percent and closed below the 20,000-point mark on Monday. The Hang Seng’s loss of 4.1 percent in August was its first monthly loss since March.In Europe, the DAX in Frankfurt fell 0.96 percent, while the CAC-40 in Paris was down 1 percent. The Euro Stoxx 50, a benchmark for the euro region, fell 1 percent. The London Stock Exchange was closed for a public holiday.The volatile market swings in China have given some global analysts pause, and some see indications of trouble stemming from the vulnerable American commercial real estate sector or simply the length of time the rally in stocks has lasted.Chinese banks, acting at the government’s behest, unleashed a flood of lending this spring and early summer as part of its efforts to stimulate the economy. Some of the funds were channeled into stocks, at least temporarily, leading some analysts to warn of an asset bubble.Lending dropped sharply in August, to about 200 billion renminbi, or $29.3 billion, about half the total for July, Mr. Kowalczyk said, citing a news report in Caijing, the authoritative financial magazine.“The Chinese government cannot be happy with such a drop,” he said, referring to the steep and rapid decline of the Shanghai index. “I expect them to soothe the market’s nerves about the availability of funds — some guidance, some moderation. The market is quite panicky.”Following are the results of Monday’s Treasury auction of three- and six-month bills:'"
"'09-09-01,'0','How did the dog get its coat? Kipling never pondered that question — he was more concerned with how the leopard got its spots, among other things — but scientists have. And the answer, they report in Science, lies in just three genes.Edouard Cadieu and Elaine A. Ostrander of the National Human Genome Research Institute, part of the National Institutes of Health, and colleagues looked at the genetic differences within single breeds that have more than one coat type. Purebred dogs are particularly suited for this kind of study, Dr. Ostrander said, because they have been selectively bred to segregate traits — there are long- and short-haired dachshunds, for example.The researchers then used that information to look at a large dataset of genetic information from about 900 dogs representing 80 breeds. They were able to identify mutations at specific points, or loci, on three genes linked to fur length, curliness and growth pattern (bushy eyebrows, beards and other features that dog breeders refer to as furnishings).Then they looked at these three loci, on the genes of another 662 dogs representing 108 breeds — from fluffy Old English sheepdogs to short-haired pugs. They found that the presence of the mutations or not, in various combinations, accounted for the variation in coat in 95 percent of the breeds. Only a few breeds, including Afghan hounds, have coats that can’t be explained by these genes.There’s a certain elegance to the findings, Dr. Ostrander said. “We look at so much of the complexity in the world around us and say, Oh gosh, the underlying genetics must be so complicated,” she said. “But we’re beginning to feel that in fact nature is simple.”The eventual goal, Dr. Ostrander said, is to use the same kind of sampling and comparison techniques to uncover how genetic variations combine to cause human diseases.'"

Attorney General Eric Holder has made clear that he intends to put the division back on track. That will not be easy, but restoring the nation’s commitment to fairness in voting, employment, housing and other areas is one of the new administration’s most important challenges.The Bush administration declared war on the whole idea of civil rights, in a way that no administration of either party had since the passage of the nation’s civil rights laws in the 1960s. It put a far-right ideologue in a top position at the civil rights division and, as the department’s inspector general said in a scathing report, he screened out job applicants with civil rights sympathies.The division abandoned its “historic mission,” notes John Payton, director-counsel of the — enforcing civil rights laws, in areas from housing to employment. In some cases, like voting rights, it aggressively fought on the anti-civil-rights side.It is heartening that the Obama administration has proposed substantially increasing the number of lawyers in the division. They will have plenty of work.On voting, the division needs to drop the Bush-era obsession with the overblown problem of vote fraud and put the emphasis back where it should be — making sure protected groups are not denied the right to vote. It has to ensure that the voter rolls are not being illegally purged, and that political operatives are not engaging in dirty tricks to suppress the minority vote. It also needs to make state and local governments comply with the “motor voter” law, which requires registration to be available at motor vehicle bureaus and welfare offices.'"
"'09-09-02,'0','The Yankees’ gesture also holds true only for the first round of the playoffs, which, assuming the Yankees open at home, would include at least two games at Yankee Stadium and a maximum of three. What’s more, ticket prices for seats sold to fans who are not season-ticket holders would increase during the first round.And if the Yankees make it to the second round, the American League Championship Series, prices will jump. The $5 bleacher seats with obstructed views will double to $10, the $25 grandstand seats will be $50, the $40 Terrace Level seats will rise to $80 and so on.The smallest increase in the second round will be 7.7 percent, but those are for $325 field-level seats that will cost $350 each for season-ticket holders. The prices for the World Series, which are set by Major League Baseball, are higher. Those inexpensive bleacher seats will go for $50 each, even though those sitting in them will still not be able to see a third of the field. The $100 field-level seats during the regular season will double to $200.All prices do not take into account the handling fee from Major League Baseball, which ranges from $1 to $6 per ticket.Each season, Major League Baseball sets a suggested ceiling for ticket prices in the first two rounds of the playoffs. But all teams, including the Yankees, retain control over the price of their premium seats and suites throughout the postseason.It is the premium seats, of course, that have troubled the Yankees this season. Earlier this season, many of the $2,500-a-game seats behind home plate sat unoccupied, a sight that caused the Yankees considerable embarrassment. The last thing the Yankees would want is to see any of those seats unfilled during the postseason.And under the ticket policy for the postseason, it is highly unlikely they will be. Tickets for those seats come in two parts — the actual ticket price and the license fee, which pays for access to clubs, restaurants and other exclusive services.In their announcement Monday, the Yankees said that fans who paid for season tickets in the Legends Suite, Delta Sky360 Suite and Jim Beam Suite would have to pay only the ticket price in the postseason and not a license fee.In the first round, that means those fans will pay from $65 to $275 for the seats, as compared to regular-season games when tickets for the same seats reached as high as $2,500.'"
"'09-09-02,'0','“For the most part, I felt surprisingly good considering I missed the last couple weeks,” Wright said.As a result of the concussion, he missed as many games — 15 — as he did between his major league debut on July 21, 2004, and that sun-splashed Saturday at Citi Field, when a 93-m.p.h. fastball from San Francisco’s Matt Cain drilled him on the helmet and knocked him into an overnight stay at a hospital. The Mets (59-73) lost 10 of those 15 games. Wright, usually cheering from the bench, was of no use.“It’s been a tough two weeks to just kind of sit back and be a spectator,” Wright said. “I’m not used to that. I got bored and felt pretty helpless.”So on Tuesday afternoon, Wright resumed his normal routine. He sat alone in a distant corner of the Mets’ clubhouse at Coors Field on Tuesday afternoon, balancing a bat against his knee. He applied pine tar to a six-inch stretch between its handle and barrel, then did it again with a second bat. He also examined his new ultraprotective helmet, the S100, designed by Rawlings. It is fitted with additional padding, helping it withstand pitches thrown at 100 m.p.h from a distance of 2 feet during independent testing, but the helmet itself is bulky and oversized. Wright said he was teased by players on both teams, but he plans to continue wearing it as long as the Mets can improve the fit.The Mets treated his concussion with the utmost caution, placing him on the disabled list less than 24 hours after he was struck. Wright remained at home for a day, battling headaches, but recovered fairly smoothly and quickly. He had several tests with neurologists and team doctors before being cleared to play.To a large extent, the Mets were influenced by an incident from last season that still haunts them: Ryan Church, two days after sustaining his second concussion in 11 weeks, was permitted to pinch-hit despite complaining of dizziness and fatigue. Church felt his worst in the high altitude of Denver, in fact, which raised questions whether this was the proper setting for Wright’s return.While it would seem plausible that being in less pressurized air could complicate management of a brain injury, some concussion experts have said that the location does not matter as long as the player has been cleared by a neurologist.“I don’t think it ever got to the point where I didn’t feel good with where I was going or good with knowing that I was going to be healthy again,” said Wright, who joined the Mets on Saturday in Chicago. “I never really thought about it. I never really allowed it to get in the back of my mind. It’s just something where, O.K., I got hurt, the doctors told me they were going to put me on the D.L., and I’ll be ready to play afterwards. It never crossed my mind that I wasn’t going to be fine.”After being released from the hospital, Wright tried to convince Jeff Wilpon, the chief operating officer, and General Manager Omar Minaya that he needed only a few days to recover. He said he was “embarrassed” to go on the disabled list for the first time, a sentiment he echoed Tuesday.“If I had to go back and do it again, I’d probably still put up a fight,” Wright said. “I still wouldn’t want to go on the D.L. But you look back on it, and it allowed me to heal the way I’m probably supposed to heal.”Going forward, Manager Jerry Manuel said he would treat Wright delicately for a day, resting him Wednesday. “I just want to be sure,” Manuel said.But after that, Wright can expect to play regularly, especially in home games, while getting an occasional day off. Before the concussion, Wright had started all but two games, and the physical and mental grind of playing every day — for a bad team — had worn him down.“I think you will see a more energized player, but I think the danger of two weeks is the rhythm at the plate,” Manuel said. “It’s hard to continue to have a rhythm with that type of time off.”When the bench coach Sandy Alomar Sr. scrawled Wright’s name on the official lineup card — black ink, all capital letters — he called it “a great feeling.”“It’s something we’ve been waiting for,” Alomar said.Johan Santana (bone fragments in left elbow) and Oliver Perez (right knee) had surgery Tuesday in New York. Both pitchers are expected to recover in time for spring training. ... Catcher Josh Thole, recalled from Class AA Binghamton, is scheduled to make his first major league start in Thursday’s series finale. When told that Nick Evans, who also made his major league debut in Denver, hit three doubles in his first game, Thole laughed and said, “I’m going to go find Nick.”'"

"'09-09-02,'0','A federal judge on Tuesday ruled against the founding principal of an Arabic-language school who sued the city, claiming that her rights were violated when she was pressured to resign in 2007 among a controversy over comments she made about the word “intifada” on a T-shirt.The principal, Debbie Almontaser, had argued in her suit that the city violated her First Amendment rights when it pressured her to resign for explaining in a newspaper interview that the word had nonviolent origins. Judge Sidney H. Stein, who dismissed the case in Federal District Court in Manhattan, rejected her claims, saying that Ms. Almontaser made her statements in the course of her duties as an administrator — not “as a citizen on a matter of public concern” — and that employers have some rights to control their employees’ words and actions.Ms. Almontaser participated in an interview “pursuant to her official duties as acting interim principal” of the school, the Khalil Gibran International Academy, the court ruled. “This speech is not protected by the First Amendment.”The controversy over Ms. Almontaser’s statements began in August 2007, when she was questioned by The New York Post about T-shirts that bore the phrase “Intifada NYC.” The shirts were sold by the group Arab Women Active in the Arts and Media, and had no relation to the school. While Ms. Almontaser did not specifically defend the use of “intifada” on the T-shirts, she defended the meaning of the phrase as literally meaning “shaking off” instead of something more violent. The Education Department was besieged by complaints, and Ms. Almontaser was asked to resign.Shortly afterward, Ms. Almontaser filed her lawsuit against the Education Department, the chancellor and Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, saying that they not only violated her right to free speech but also “conspired to deny her the opportunity to regain her position as principal.”Alan Levine, a lawyer for Ms. Almontaser, did not immediately respond to a phone message on Tuesday night. In a statement, Paul Marks, a lawyer representing the city in the case, said he was pleased by the dismissal.Correction: September 8, 2009  An article in some editions on Wednesday about the dismissal of a lawsuit filed against the city by Debbie Almontaser, the founding principal of an Arabic-language school, misstated the circumstances of her departure from that position and referred imprecisely to comments she made in a newspaper interview. Ms. Almontaser resigned under pressure in 2007; she was not fired. In the interview, about an organization of Arab women that was selling T-shirts with the phrase “Intifada NYC” on them, Ms. Almontaser gave the roots of the word during the interview and generally defended the group, with which she was unaffiliated. But she did not specifically defend the use of “intifada” on the T-shirts. The same imprecision appeared in several other articles in 2007 about the controversy.'"

She lost, 2-6, 6-3, 7-6 (7), to Kateryna Bondarenko of Ukraine, in the first major upset of the tournament.But in the final match of the night, second-seeded Andy Murray, who lost to Roger Federer in last year’s final, managed to avoid an upset against Ernests Gulbis of Latvia, winning by 7-5, 6-3, 7-5.Sharapova, who won the Open in 2006, will play Christina McHale, a 17-year-old wild card from Englewood Cliffs, N.J., who won both the singles and doubles titles at an under-18 tournament this summer in Berkeley, Calif.Dent had been out of action for more than two years with two fractures in lower vertebrae that required three operations, the most recent in September 2007. He had minor surgery in 2006 that did not work, so he underwent spinal fusion surgery in March 2007. That did not work either, so he had the third procedure.A bronze medalist at the 1996 Olympics, Dent now had to contemplate some alternatives. During his lengthy recovery process in bed, he prepared to get his real estate license, played video games, studied religion and politics, and read. But he was never sure he would be able to play at the United States Open again.“It’s like a kid waking up on Christmas morning and seeing all these presents,” he said afterward.Sharapova, whose career was never in jeopardy, was less ecstatic about her victorious return. She opted for surgery in October 2008, which was performed by Dr. David Altchek, an orthopedic surgeon who has operated on dozens of major league baseball players.The procedure repaired a partly torn rotator cuff and tightened a loose capsule in her right shoulder. But even after the surgery, she was still unable to go through her normal serving motion. Part of her rehabilitation involved learning a new, more compact serve.She now has a lower toss, with her right arm moving up more vertically. It is as if she is trying to push her arm up, rather than having it come from behind like a windmill, the way it did for the first 15 years of her tennis life.

"'09-09-02,'0','While some of OTB’s problems are beyond its control, a recent audit by the state comptroller, Thomas P. DiNapoli, questioned whether the expense of so many vehicles was necessary to care for 68 slumping betting parlors.One OTB vehicle, a 2004 Ford van, averaged 2,500 miles a year; a 1996 model averaged less than 4,000 miles annually. Four 2003 Dodge Ram pickup trucks were driven an average of about 10,000 miles a year.During the audit, OTB officials displayed a knack for numbers unbecoming of a bookmaker. They reported that the director of software development put fewer than 100 miles a year on his car. They said OTB’s general counsel had logged nearly 1 million miles on his 2002 Impala.Some odometers pointed to forces beyond the exigencies of the horse game.The general counsel, who owns a home in Larchmont and actually drives his car about 12,000 miles a year, was one of 50 employees allowed to use official cars for commuting.Letting officials take the cars home at night saves OTB the cost of expensive overnight parking near its headquarters in Times Square, where about 250 employees are based, said the organization’s executive director, Raymond V. Casey. The audit questioned why 22 executives required cars at their disposal. The number included Mr. Casey and OTB’s director of equal employment opportunity.Mr. Casey did not dispute the finding that fewer cars were needed. He said he had sharply reduced the fleet since becoming director in 2001 and had ordered an additional 12 vehicles to be sold after seeing a draft of the audit. He also created a vehicle-sharing system for executives.“We fundamentally believe that we can always run a more efficient business,” Mr. Casey said.He added that the director of software development had taken on more direct oversight of 50 employees at OTB’s warehouse in Queens since the audit, and had more need of a car.Cutting back on the use of vehicles is unlikely to solve OTB’s larger financial problems. Mr. Casey said OTB is hobbled because it is required to pay the horse racing industry and the state before covering its own expenses. In 2008, those payments amounted to more than half of the $245 million that OTB brought in after paying winning bettors.“At the end of the day, it doesn’t get fixed based on a reduction of expenses,” he said.Mr. DiNapoli has his job in part because of a scandal involving official vehicles. His predecessor, Alan G. Hevesi, left office after admitting he had allowed his ailing wife to use a state car and driver for private matters.Part of OTB’s payroll reads more Nascar than Triple Crown. It has employed three automotive mechanics, seven drivers and a motor vehicle supervisor, who, combined, earned $500,000 a year. In addition to those salaries, the state comptroller found that gas, insurance and outside repairs cost $585,000 a year.Though much of its fleet has aged, OTB bought four new Ford Explorers in 2007. One went to its in-house lobbyist. That came as OTB hired Park Strategies, a lobbying firm founded by former Senator Alfonse M. D’Amato, under a no-bid contract for $12,000 a month, a move also criticized by the comptroller.There is no magic formula to determine an appropriate fleet size for an operation like OTB. But consider that the State Department of Taxation and Finance, with 89 vehicles, has a similar fleet but a much more sweeping mission, including inspecting retail businesses and cigarette sellers across the state. Of its fleet, 82 cars are available to investigators, and none are assigned to executives, said Thomas Bergin, a tax department spokesman.The city’s subway system — used occasionally by the mayor and almost exclusively by city workers involved in questions as urgent as child welfare — does not appear to have been a popular choice for travel for OTB executives.Some OTB customers are tired of hearing about its money woes.On Monday evening, in a windowless sitting area of a parlor at East 53rd Street and Second Avenue in Manhattan, three men half-heartedly watched the television screens and laughed affectionately about an old friend, Sammy, who always goes with the gray horse.An interruption seeking thoughts about OTB’s running deep in the red, and its spending on cars, was met with groans.“I tell you what,” said a man with a long gray ponytail who would identify himself only as George, “my bookie in the Bronx don’t have this problem. He always has money. Nowhere else in the world does a bookie lose money.”'"
"'09-09-02,'0','She read from her notes of recent calls. “I was laid off, have no car, no job and no friends that can even bring me there,” one caller had argued. Another said, “I cannot even afford the gas to have to come down there.”Jane Hybarger, the jury administrator for the District Court in , said the pleas she was hearing were more urgent, even desperate.“Now I’m hearing people who are living day to day, who are months behind in their ,” Ms. Hybarger said. “There’s tears in their voice — they don’t know how they’re going to put food on the table.”Judge Rosenberg, in , said in an interview that when the “pervasive cloud of financial insecurity” reaches the jury room, “a judge has to be sensitive to the economic times.” He had also dismissed Michael Lazar, a self-employed “steel detailer,” or designer of steel structures. Mr. Lazar said “it would kill me” to miss opportunities to work; he might lose his home.Alan Abeles, who owns a company that makes promotional items like T-shirts, also told Judge Rosenberg he could not serve — “no, sir, not in this economy.” The judge pressed Mr. Abeles about whether any of his employees could fill in. “I fired everybody,” he replied; just three employees remained, and none were capable of taking on his duties. He, too, was released.Other judges say they sense a shift as well. Judge Barbara M. G. Lynn of the Federal District Court in said that as she geared up recently for a trial that was to last several months, the pleas from jurors differed from those in a case of similar length she impaneled a few years ago.“I did have more people who had lost their jobs,” Judge Lynn said, “or were looking for a new job, or were relocating for a job.” Many potential jurors told her that their employers would not pay for their jury time — employers that she knew, from the previous long trial, had paid in the past.Unemployment — or the fear of it — is hardly a barrier to jury service, of course, and being without a job could even make it easier for some people to do their civic duty. Jury experts say that many people have an exaggerated sense of the hardship that service requires.“Most people, when they’re called for jury duty, assume if they are going to be on a trial, it’s going to be a long trial,” said Shari Seidman Diamond, a law professor at . In fact, Professor Diamond said, the typical trial takes just two or three days, and in many jurisdictions jurors are dismissed after one day if they are not placed on a jury.Longer cases prompt greater efforts to head for the exits, said Douglas L. Keene, a trial consultant in , Tex. Those who are unemployed “can’t afford to not be out there looking for a job,” Mr. Keene said. And despite laws that protect jurors from being fired for their service, he said, people whose companies have gone through rounds of layoffs worry about the impact on them of several days away from the office.Fretful or angry jurors are a concern for plaintiffs’ lawyers in civil suits, Mr. Keene said, because the plaintiffs brought the suit and “are more likely to be blamed by the jurors for any inconvenience that jury duty caused them.”Judge Rosenberg agreed. He could force more jurors into the box than he does, he said, but a miserable juror who is straining to get back to work might be too eager to reach a quick verdict instead of engaging in a full and careful deliberation. “That’s not the juror you want,” he said. “That’s not justice.”There are actions that states could take to make jury service less painful financially, said Patricia Lee Refo, a lawyer in , principally paying jurors more. Jury service, Ms. Refo said, is “a critically important civic service,” and “we should pay them in accordance with the importance of their work.”That is not a likely path for financially squeezed states to take, and some areas are openly hoping that people without incomes will find jury pay attractive. Matt Benefiel, a court official in Orange County, Fla., which includes , said that while the area’s unemployment rate was higher than the national average, the number of people claiming hardship to get out of service had not increased.“We might actually have jurors who are looking to get the money,” Mr. Benefiel said, which amounts to $15 a day for the first three days and $30 thereafter.“If somebody’s out of work, I guess jury service is a paying job,” Mr. Goodman said, even if the daily check from the court is just $40. “It’s not going to get you into ,” he said, “but it’s something.”'"

Until 2004.That was when Mr. Caring, now 60, began to rise in the ranks of London’s restaurateurs, collecting places that are among those most cherished by London’s notables.He got his feet wet with the Wentworth Club in Surry.

"'09-09-02,'0','Freedom Communications, the media company that owns The Orange County Register of California and more than 30 other dailies, filed for bankruptcy on Tuesday, with the approval of its creditors.It is the latest in a string of bankruptcies at media companies, many of which are struggling with depressed advertising revenue and sometimes heavy debt loads.The filing, in Federal Bankruptcy Court in Delaware, follows months of negotiations between Freedom and its secured lenders, led by JPMorgan Chase. Under the terms of a prearranged reorganization plan, the lenders will take over the company.Freedom’s existing owners — descendants of the founder R. C. Hoiles and the private equity firms Blackstone Group and Providence Equity Partners — will have their equity stakes reduced to about 2 percent when the company emerges from bankruptcy protection, Burl Osborne, the chief executive of Freedom, said.The family, Blackstone and Providence will also receive warrants that will allow them to gain up to an additional 10 percent stake over the next five years, if the company hits certain financial goals.Freedom had been negotiating with its secured lenders, which now number about 26 firms, since it first ran afoul of its credit agreements last fall. While Freedom had won a waiver from its lenders, it finally decided that it could not solve its problems through an out-of-court restructuring, according to a court filing by Mark A. McEachen, its chief financial officer.'"
"'09-09-02,'0','The Oscar process is clearly still in process. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences says its decision in June to double the number of best-picture nominees to 10 brings with it a change in voting method. The best picture will now be chosen by a preferential voting system, rather than the single-choice voting used in other categories. In a statement on Monday, Tom Sherak, the new president of the academy, said preferential voting would help choose the best-picture candidate “with the strongest support of a majority of our electorate.” In the single-choice system, voters pick their film, and the one with the most votes wins. Oscar voters will now be expected to rank their best-picture choices, 1 through 10. Without such ranking, the wider field of nominees raised the possibility that a film would win top honors even it were preferred by only a small plurality of voters. The best picture was last chosen by preferential voting in 1945, the academy said.'"
"'09-09-02,'0','Some openings — like that of the $7 million SD26, the lower-key successor to the restaurateur Tony May’s austere San Domenico — are downright buzzy. Can a season really be such a drag if Danny Meyer (Maialino in the Gramercy Park Hotel) and Jean-Georges Vongerichten (in the Mark Hotel) are branching out again?And while the chic Town shut down, the blazing chef David Chang will be planting his Momofuku flag in its Chambers Hotel space, with a Southeast Asian newbie.Lively neighborhoods get livelier: Williamsburg will see Saltie’s sandwich shop, from Caroline Fidanza of Diner and Marlow & Sons, St. Anselm from the folks who own the bar Spuyten Duyvil, and the long-awaited Fatty ’Cue from Zakary Pelaccio of Fatty Crab.And recession successes doggedly extend their brands: the multiple-Baoguette mini-empire of the chef Michael Huynh will expand to Obao Noodles and Grill on East 53rd Street and B Clinton on Clinton Street. Keith McNally, the 58-year-old proprietor of Balthazar, Pastis and Minetta Tavern, is focusing on Pulino’s Bar and Pizzeria, which he expects to open at the corner of Houston Street and the Bowery in December. But he said he’d been planning for the restaurant for four or five years and casual, cheaper dining trends had nothing to do with his choice of style.“The fact that it’s the hot thing right now,” he said of the pizzas he’d be serving, “would really put me right off it.”Beyond the cut-and-thrust of the restaurant fray, there is evidence to suggest a triumph of survival in New York. The city’s leisure and hospitality workers have fared much better in the city’s economic mix than financial and professional-service workers, said Michael L. Dolfman, the regional commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics in New York. Although the city’s food and drinking places shed more than 10,000 out of some 200,000 workers after the jolt to the economy last fall, employment was back to 200,000 by May — and up 4,000 more by July. “If higher-end restaurants may be suffering, the lower-end restaurants may be seeing an increase in demand — and employment,” Dr. Dolfman said.Visitors from abroad, who have done their bit in the past for the city’s restaurants, are still coming, according to one of the best barometers of foreign tourism, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, which this year has welcomed 10 percent more visitors from abroad than in the comparable months of 2008, according to Harold Holzer, a senior vice president.And recession or not, entrepreneurs just can’t stop themselves.“This is a great time to look for growth,” said Burak Karacam, the owner of Pera Mediterranean Brasserie, a 150-seat Turkish restaurant at 303 Madison Avenue in Manhattan, “because landlords are offering more creative deal structures.” Mr. Karacam, a former Harvard-trained investment banker, is negotiating for two new locations to establish more casual Pera extensions.Although rent increases have driven some restaurants out of business, some lease-hunters are stunned to find affordable spaces.“Landlords are a little chastened,” said Stuart Morden, a senior managing director at the brokerage Newmark Retail LLC. They realize, he said, that “to wait for the economy to turn around is folly.” Mr. Morden said that many landlords are now offering rent abatements. The landlord of Eighty One, the Excelsior Hotel, is one of them, Mr. Brown said.And restaurateurs are showing that they are willing to move on to find deals, or customers. “Rents can be affordable citywide,” Mr. Morden said, “so no neighborhood can be ruled out, as far as good restaurants are concerned.”Ergo: the Bowery footprint is extended as Travertine locates at Kenmare Street and the Bowery. Or consider the odyssey of the neo-Philippine restaurant Cendrillon.After its 10-year-lease in SoHo ran out, the landlord wanted to triple the rent, said Amy Besa, 59, an owner. “But a lot of our Manhattan customers had moved to Brooklyn,” she said.And so she and her husband, the chef Romy Dorotan, will open the new Purple Yam in a few weeks at 1314 Cortelyou Road in vibrant Ditmas Park, near their home. They are busily testing pan-Asian extensions to their menu. Their new lease — $5,000 including rent, real estate taxes, and water and sewer fees — is about a third of what they were paying in SoHo.“On nights and weekends, SoHo could be a ghost town,” Ms. Besa said, “but now we’re in a real neighborhood again.”In the new crisis-versus-opportunity showdown, one operator’s nightmare can be another restaurateur’s future. When Al Bustan Restaurant, a 20-year-old Lebanese stalwart on Third Avenue in Manhattan, faced a $10,000 rent increase, its owner quickly found a space three blocks away at 319 East 53rd Street.“It was going to be a steakhouse, and they spent a lot of money on it,” said Elias Ghafary, the owner of Al Bustan. “It was ready to open. But a steakhouse wasn’t suitable for us, so we’re renovating and will open after Labor Day.”Often, in this wickedly fickle downturn, even high-end reservations have been no problem. Although there are always exceptions. (Lots of luck landing a great slot at Corton.)And while Ken Friedman and his partner, the chef April Bloomfield, just shut the John Dory, their well-regarded seafood restaurant near the meatpacking district, they are now hoisting their standard at the Breslin Bar and Dining Room in the Ace Hotel on West 29th Street.But the agita of the finance-challenged remains.“The banks have pulled in their lines of credit and are giving zero money to restaurants,” said Faye Fisher, a vice president at Advance Restaurant Finance, one of the few companies in New York making restaurant loans. “Even when this recession is all over, banks won’t turn around and give money — for years.”So now, “the money is out there, but it is all based on relationships — people you’ve known for years,” said Tracy Nieporent, director of marketing and a partner in the Myriad Restaurant Group, which runs Nobu and Corton.Yet even if future New York restaurants have more plebeian build-outs, restaurateurs, like theater folk, are likely to keep angling for the next runaway hit.“This,” Mr. Nieporent said, “is the business we’ve chosen, as they say in ‘The Godfather.’ ”'"
"'09-09-02,'0','“It’s not a big rebound, but there are some interesting signs,” said Maurice Lévy, chief executive of one of the largest advertising companies, the Publicis Groupe.One reason for caution is that advertisers are waiting to commit their budgets; as a result, ad executives and media owners complain that they have little visibility about spending prospects, beyond a matter of days or weeks.This complicates some executives’ thinking as they wrestle with the question of whether to try to charge consumers more for access to their content, or to continue to rely on advertising for the bulk of revenue.Some analysts argue that traditional media will never regain ad spending lost during the recession, as advertisers shift to other outlets, like the Internet, cable and satellite television channels.“If the ad industry doesn’t pay every single bill anymore, then the consumer — directly or indirectly — will have to step up,” Mr. Zeiler said. Newspaper publishers, too, are talking about erecting so-called pay walls for their Web sites.The differing fortunes of media companies that are heavily dependent on advertising, on one hand, and those that rely more on consumer purchases, on the other, is reflected in earnings reports this week from two big European media companies, Bertelsmann and Vivendi.On Monday, Bertelsmann, which owns a majority of RTL, reported a 30 percent drop in operating profit and a 6.5 percent decline in revenue for the first half of the year, citing sharp declines in advertising.On Tuesday, Vivendi, which is less dependent on advertising, reported a 1 percent rise in operating profit on a 17 percent increase in revenue.Consultants at PricewaterhouseCoopers say they think this gap between advertising and other forms of revenue will persist, adding that global ad spending will remain below 2008 levels four years from now. By contrast, spending on media and entertainment by consumers and businesses will rise to $812 billion in 2013, from $707 billion this year, the company says.But Mr. Coppet of UBS says some of the gloom is overdone. While global ad spending has fallen more steeply than expected this year, he has increased his outlook for next year, saying spending will rise 3.9 percent. In 2011, he added, growth will accelerate to 6.9 percent.Mr. Coppet is relatively sanguine about the prospects for recovery because, he said, much of the structural shift caused by the rise of digital technology has already occurred. Ad spending as a percentage of the overall economy is already at postwar lows in the United States, he said, suggesting that there is room for growth.“We expect the cyclical recovery to overwhelm the structural advertising decline for the next three years before softening,” he wrote.In ad agency executive suites, the outlook remains more subdued. Martin Sorrell, chief executive of the WPP Group, said last week, as the company reported a big drop in earnings for the first half, that he saw few signs that improved sentiment about the economy was translating into higher spending by advertisers.“I think what’s happened is that people feel better about life, and so their heads and hearts are strong,” he said, “but that hasn’t extended, as we said at the end of the first quarter, to the checkbook or investment in branding.”Adam Smith, the top forecaster at WPP’s media buying division, GroupM, said there were a few exceptions to the general gloom. Spending in Germany has shown a slight uptick, he said, and big consumer product companies are putting money back into television advertising in China to take advantage of a buoyant economy there.But prospects in the United States and Britain remain particularly weak, Mr. Smith said. Over all, GroupM still predicts a 1.4 percent slide in global ad spending next year, on top of a 5.5 percent decline this year.At Publicis, Mr. Lévy said he saw some positive signals, enough to declare that the low point of the current ad recession probably came in June. July and August had month-to-month improvements, he said, and early indications for September show the trend continuing.The first year-on-year growth will probably not occur until next summer, Mr. Lévy said, but that should be good enough to propel an increase of 2 to 3 percent in global spending next year. Over the longer term, he dismissed the idea of a structural decline and predicted yearly gains in the “midsingle digits.”“It is a business that will continue to grow, and we will see advertisers spending more in the sector,” Mr. Lévy said. “But the fight for market share will be tougher.”In recent years, market share has largely been shifting from traditional media to the Internet, which Mr. Coppet says will garner 15.2 percent of global ad spending in 2011, up from 2.7 percent in 2001. Print media will continue to lose spending to the Internet and other media, he says, but another established medium, television, will actually gain.Major American television networks are counting on a cyclical rebound. Usually, they ask advertisers to commit to the vast majority of their advertising time in advance, but during the annual upfront selling season this summer, they reportedly held back substantial numbers of slots for the coming season. According to Advertising Age, that resulted in a decline in sales, from $7.8 billion to $8.1 billion, compared with $9.23 billion last year.The networks hope to recoup the shortfall by selling time at higher rates, on short notice, if and when the ad market recovers.Analysts’ forecasts of a rebound are bolstered by the fact that next year will include big marketing events like the quadrennial World Cup soccer tournament, the Winter Olympics and the midterm Congressional elections.For the moment, however, “no one can say today that all the lights are green and the recovery is already here,” Mr. Lévy said.'"
"'09-09-02,'0','Of all the places in the city you can go to recharge your spiritual batteries, one of the loveliest and least well known is the sculpture garden at the Noguchi Museum in Long Island City, Queens.A smallish, triangular plot enclosed by high walls, it has benches, shade trees, walkways snaking between areas of loose, rounded stones and elegant abstract sculptures carved from various kinds of rock carefully placed here and there. A basalt polyhedron has water flowing up from its interior and coating its sides like a second skin. Created by the Japanese-American artist and designer Isamu Noguchi, the garden is so beautifully composed and so peaceful that it is sure to soothe even the most harried New Yorker’s soul.Strolling through the museum’s cool, quiet, evenly lighted galleries is pleasant, too. The current exhibition, “Noguchi ReINstalled,” opened this summer in anticipation of the museum’s 25th anniversary in 2010. It presents about 200 works dating from the 1920s to the 1980s. They include sculptures in stone, wood, metal and clay; maquettes and models for parks and playgrounds; stage set elements for Martha Graham dance productions; and photographs of public monuments in cities around the world. Though unfailingly suave, Noguchi’s work no longer has the urgency it once had, but the museum as a whole is a wonderful time capsule.Noguchi founded the museum in an industrial building across the street from his Long Island City studio. (Incessantly peripatetic, he had a studio in Japan as well.) When the institution opened in 1985, it was the first such museum to be established by a living artist in America. Noguchi died three years later.Born in Los Angeles in 1904, he was one of the 20th century’s most celebrated and successful sculptors. He is less widely admired today, but some of his public works are still impressive. Standing en pointe in front of 140 Broadway, at Liberty Street, in the financial district, his “Red Cube” (1968) packs a cheery, Pop-Minimalist punch. His gigantic Horace E. Dodge Fountain on the Philip A. Hart Plaza in Detroit (completed 1979) — a big, horizontal ring of stainless-steel pipe supported by a pair of angled tubes — has the eerie look of an extraterrestrial spacecraft from a Steven Spielberg movie. Noguchi had a great feel for large-scale public works.Nothing at the Noguchi Museum is so thrilling, partly because nothing is so big. Almost everything in the current exhibition is between coffee-table scale and armoire size. Moreover, there is a formulaic sameness about most of the works, which date from the ’60s onward. Over and over Noguchi resorted to the same basic recipe of setting up tension between formal and material opposites. “Black Planet” (1974) is a slab of black basalt with a polished dome emerging from a roughly chiseled surround. In “Night Bird” (1966), a smooth black marble form perches on a vertical plank of stainless steel.'"
"'09-09-02,'0','SEOUL, South Korea — North Korea restored regular border crossings for traffic going to South Korean factories in the North on Tuesday, while its leader, Kim Jong-il, reiterated his government’s call for a peace treaty with the United States.North Korea had previously called for talks with Washington to replace the truce — which fell short of a formal treaty — that ended the Korean War in 1953.“We can ease tensions and remove the danger of war on the peninsula when the United States abandons its hostile policy and signs a peace treaty with us,” Mr. Kim said in a commentary carried on Pyongyang Radio, which broadcasts North Korean government statements abroad.The dispatch, which was released late Monday, did not say when Mr. Kim made the statement. But the remark was the latest in a number of recent conciliatory overtures from the North.Meanwhile, on Tuesday, North Korea restored regular traffic for South Korean companies that have operations in a joint industrial park in the North Korean border city of Kaesong. The North had sharply curtailed such traffic in December.'"

"'09-09-03,'1','The diverted life plans of families like the Petruccis are an unintended economic consequence of the nation’s sprawling 401(k) plans. These private retirement savings vehicles, designed 30 years ago as a supplement to traditional corporate pensions, have somewhat haphazardly replaced the old system, like an innocuous weed that somehow overgrew the garden.As is apparent in this downturn, the economic effects of such an ad hoc system can be perverse. In boom times, when companies need more workers, the most experienced employees may decide to retire, taking comfort in their bloated 401(k)s, whose values typically fluctuate with the financial markets.Today, the reverse is happening in the first deep recession since the new accounts became so pervasive. A Pew Research survey scheduled for Thursday release found that nearly four in 10 workers over age 62 say they have delayed their retirement because of the recession. (Though the data omits some people who have retired and includes some who are still working, the Social Security Administration said that about 2.3 million people that age started collecting benefits last year.)“One unappreciated side effect of the 401(k) system is that it’s a sort of reverse automatic stabilizer,” says Teresa Ghilarducci, an economics professor at the New School.The recent retirement losses have prompted policy makers to discuss whether Americans need a stronger social safety net, not just in health care and unemployment benefits, but in retirement as well.Economists say there are advantages to reducing the financial risk for individuals. Pooling investments, in some cases, allows workers to switch jobs more easily and helps lower fees associated with investment decisions, for example.Alternatives include creating incentives for saving and for less risky investments through tax laws or other regulations. The Obama administration has proposed an opt-out retirement savings system, for example. And even before the crisis, some states developed plans for pooling private savings into voluntary, portable retirement accounts.Though their pension systems may be strained, people in many countries with stronger safety nets are still exiting the labor force in lockstep despite the global recession. Last year in the United States, almost a third of people ages 65 to 69 were still in the labor force; in France, just 4 percent of people this age were still working or looking for work.After all, Europe isn’t just the land of “socialized” medicine. It is also the land of “socialized” retirement plans, and like other automatic stabilizers, pensions help cushion the blow of an economic crisis.Retirement income typically comes from a combination of three buckets: state pensions, corporate pensions and individual arrangements. In many other industrialized countries, that first bucket — state pensions — supports a large amount of retirees’ income.The typical American receives just 45 percent of his preretirement wage through Social Security, according to the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development. By contrast, a worker in Denmark, which has one of the most comprehensive and generous retirement arrangements in the world, can retire with a state pension that is 91 percent of his salary.“The financial crisis hasn’t affected me,” says Jens Erik Soerensen, a 63-year-old in Hellerup, Denmark, who works as a researcher at Chempilots, a Danish company that develops polymers for use in the medical device industry.Mr. Soerensen has calculated that when he retires, the combined disposable income that he has with his wife (Lone, also 63, who retired this year from her job in TV production) will fall by about 20 percent. The couple will also continue to benefit from universal health coverage.“I think we can survive without changing our lifestyle, at least until 75,” he said. After that, he might have to dip into personal savings.Of course, such a system comes with tradeoffs. To help pay for generous state pensions, Danish workers have one of the highest tax burdens. The population is also aging, meaning that there will be fewer working people to pay for the pensions and care of a graying society.In response, some nations have been trying to encourage people to stay at work longer. In France, suggestions to raise the retirement age above its current level of 60 have met fierce opposition from unions, although the government intends to push ahead. Britain has had a bit more success, announcing plans to raise the retirement age to 68, from 65 — in 2044.Along with raising the retirement age, some European countries have been shifting more financial risk to individuals.In the United States, where the practice is decades old, the question is whether people can be freed from making their own financial decisions, an act they may not feel qualified to do and may not want to do.One study found that nearly a quarter of Americans ages 56 to 64 had more than 90 percent of their 401(k) balances invested in stocks instead of bonds, against financial advisers’ standard advice for people nearing retirement age.“Employees are just not capable of making these decisions,” said Rick K. Shapiro, a member of the army of financial planning professionals that America’s private retirement system (and private health care and college education financing systems) has spawned. “Maybe they can learn, but they’re distracted, and they’re not incented to learn until the thing blows up.”Even conscientious investors — like the Petruccis, who keep an updated spreadsheet of their investments — lose money.“We thought we were conservative,” said Mr. Petrucci, noting that he and his wife lost about 35 percent of their life savings in the crisis and have made only a little of it back.Still, the American preference for self-reliance, instead of more socialized financial protections, remains strong, even among those who lost big.“I don’t want to depend on anybody else in my retirement,” Mr. Petrucci said. “Not family members, not our children, and certainly not the government, for that matter.”'"
"'09-09-03,'1','Merck spent $7 million in the second quarter of this year on legal expenses in the case and has set aside $42 million to defend itself in about 900 federal and state Fosamax cases brought by about 1,280 plaintiff groups, according to a company regulatory filing at the end of June.Timothy O’Brien, the lead lawyer for Mrs. Boles, said that an updated number would be closer to 1,200 pending cases. His law firm represents about 400 Fosamax plaintiffs, he said.Meanwhile, other drug companies and plaintiffs’ lawyers expecting to try similar cases involving related bone drugs have been closely monitoring the case to see which arguments resonate with the jury.Merck’s main defense is that there is no definitive medical evidence proving that Fosamax causes jawbone death and that Mrs. Boles had other health factors that could have caused her jaw problems.Meanwhile, Mr. O’Brien, the lawyer for Mrs. Boles, has been using the case to put Fosamax itself on trial, contending that Merck as a corporation put patients at risk by overpromoting Fosamax and by not warning doctors who prescribe the drug about the potential for jawbone disintegration.The trial began Aug. 12. Mr. O’Brien has presented internal Merck e-mail messages, company documents and case reports from medical journals to bolster his case that Merck knew about jaw problems associated with Fosamax and did not study the problem or warn doctors about it in a timely fashion.Merck contends that the company became aware of the problem only in late 2003 after the first case report associating bisphosphonates with jaw injuries appeared in a medical journal. According to evidence in the case, the company subsequently assembled a panel of doctors to review reports it had received and determine which cases were likely to be osteonecrosis of the jaw.The Food and Drug Administration approved Fosamax in 1995 to treat the bone loss of osteoporosis associated with menopause. In 1997, the agency approved the drug to prevent osteoporosis itself.Until the recent introduction of branded and generic competitors for the osteoporosis drug market, Fosamax was one of the most popular drugs in the United States. Doctors in the United States wrote about 2.6 million prescriptions for the drug last year, which was down from more than 15 million prescriptions in 2007, according to annual reports from Drug Topics, an industry magazine.Fosamax had global sales of $1.55 billion last year, a decrease of almost 50 percent compared with 2007, according to a Merck financial statement.On Wednesday afternoon, Judge Keenan asked the jury to decide several questions: Was Merck negligent in formulating Fosamax? Did the company fail to warn Mrs. Boles’s doctor of a known risk of the drug? Is Fosamax a defective product? And, if the jury answers yes to any of those questions, did that circumstance legally cause Mrs. Boles’s jawbone problems?If the jury decides in favor of Mrs. Boles, it can award compensatory damages for her suffering. But Judge Keenan has ruled out punitive damages in this particular case because he said the evidence did not suggest malice on the part of Merck. Mrs. Boles developed a dental problem in 2002, he wrote, before scientific articles were published on the issue which would have alerted Merck to potential problems.Plaintiffs may have a difficult time proving the drug has directly caused people’s jawbone injuries.Jawbone death has long been a known side effect of radiation in patients being treated for oral cancer. But, about six years ago, a few oral surgeons began reporting jawbone death in patients who had not received radiation for oral cancer.Instead, the patients had been prescribed bisphosphonates, a group of drugs that affect the way that bones renew themselves, said Dr. Salvatore Ruggiero, an oral surgeon in Lake Success, N.Y., who has not been involved in the court case. These include pills like Fosamax as well as Zometa, an intravenous bisphosphonate used to treat bone cancer.Bisphosphonates work by inhibiting cells from breaking down old or damaged bone, a beneficial effect that inhibits bone loss. At the same time, the drugs can have a drawback. They can have a secondary effect of decreasing the formation of new bone tissue, Judge Keenan wrote in an opinion in July.It is the drug’s potential for decreasing the formation of new bone tissue that may contribute to jawbone death, said Dr. Ruggiero, who was one of the first doctors to study and publish articles on the problem. Because of the trauma caused by chewing and teeth grinding, jawbone cells turnover more quickly than many other bones in the body, he said. Recognizing the high cell turnover, bisphosphonates may accumulate in the jawbone, and try to compensate by oversuppressing cell turnover, he said.According to this theory, bisphosphonates might lead to jawbone death in patients who have dental surgery, like tooth extraction, from which the jaw needs to heal itself even more intensely, he said.Dr. Ruggerio said he had a database of 70 patients who had developed dead jawbone tissue after taking oral bisphosphonates. “The number of cases that we are now seeing is unprecedented,” he said.But there is no definitive scientific proof that Fosamax causes jawbone death, Paul Strain, the lead lawyer for Merck, told the jury on Wednesday morning. Although anecdotal case reports of the problem and animal studies have appeared in medical journals, nobody has conducted a rigorous clinical trial to look at whether there is a higher incidence of the problem in people taking the drug than in people who do not, he said.In 2004, the Food and Drug Administration reviewed the safety of bisphosphonates and concluded that osteonecrosis of the jaw could be a risk for the class of drugs as a whole, not just those that are administered intravenously. The agency asked manufacturers to amend drug labels to acknowledge that there have been reports of jawbone death in patients taking the drugs.'"
"'09-09-03,'1','Prime Minister Kostas Karamanlis set the nation on a political footing Wednesday, telling voters to prepare for early national elections so he could have “a fresh public mandate” to cut spending and push reforms. Mr. Karamanlis, struggling with a sputtering economy, allegations of cronyism and outrage over his government’s handling of forest fires last month, did not announce a date for the snap elections, which could come as early as Oct. 4. The center-right government had said it would serve out its term, ending in September 2011. But faced with a threat by opposition socialists to force early elections in March, when Parliament elects a new president, Mr. Karamanlis vowed on Wednesday that he would not serve as a lame duck. Some pundits called his move a risky political gambit.'"
"'09-09-03,'1','The campaign, however, is not likely to make the problem go away, state officials and dog owners say, particularly in a neighborhood like the Pearl District, where many people who are not physically disabled consider the company of their pets therapeutic and insist on taking them just about everywhere. Some banks put water bowls by their front doors, and dog day-care facilities take time to serve pets the specially packed lunches their owners make for them.“Portland is dog crazy,” said Andrea Schneider, who lives in the Pearl District and runs pdxdog.com, a social network for dog lovers. “If you don’t understand that context, you’re not going to get this.”Ms. Schneider confessed that she had in the past taken her golden retriever, Ellie, who is not a service animal, into places where animals were prohibited, fearing leaving the dog on the street. She said she took Ellie to Safeway, too, thinking dogs were allowed. When an employee politely stopped her, she said that “it was a surprise” but that she understood.The federal Food Code, based on language from the Americans with Disabilities Act, describes service animals as aiding people with physical disabilities and performing certain tasks the disabled person cannot, like those provided by Seeing Eye dogs. The code says, too, that a service animal is not considered a pet.Yet the disability law also limits the extent to which a private business can question people about their disabilities and the service an animal provides, and there is no requirement under state or federal law that an animal be licensed or somehow labeled as a service animal.A new poster created by the state says, “Animals that provide support or companionship are not regarded as service animals.” Still, the limits on questions a business can ask could leave the door open to interpretation and abuse.“It’s this weird gray area,” said Caitlin Lomen, working in the deli at Whole Foods. “Like when you see little Foo Foo in someone’s purse, you know that’s not a service animal.”A co-worker, Carl Anderson, joined the conversation, saying: “Some people are kind of grossed out by it, but it’s a comfort thing for a lot of people, to have their dog with them. Who am I to judge someone else’s needs?”“Unless they’re jumping up and eating out of the salad bar,” Mr. Anderson added, “we try to roll with it the best we can.”The Pearl District is a recently erected confection in a city often regarded as ahead of the curve in so-called New Urbanist thinking. Streetcars whisper by. Yoga is popular in Tanner Springs Park, described by a sign at its entrance as “a habitat garden created on reclaimed industrial land.” Dogs are not allowed in that park, but some owners let them run free at a dog park nearby, where the area’s developer, Hoyt, provides bags for poop and empties the trash cans that fill up quickly.“Livability perfected” is printed on the back of the business card of Tiffany Sweitzer, the president of Hoyt, which began developing the area in the 1990s. Ms. Sweitzer said that dogs were initially not a priority for the project, which is built on old railyards, but that they had become central to its identity. Her family dog, Scout, is featured prominently in advertising.Ms. Sweitzer said she once tried to promote a condominium building as dog-free. “You couldn’t believe how many people called me and said, ‘What are you doing?’ ” she said.Mr. Sax, with Star at Whole Foods, is not a condominium owner. He said he was living in a hostel after having moved up from Los Angeles a few weeks ago. He produced a card identifying Star as a service animal. The card is sold at activedogs.com for less than $30; the Web site notes that it “is not a certifying agency, nor do we hold any responsibility for information that you have us put on your ID badge.”Mr. Sax, 57, said Star helped him because he did not “see that well,” though he is able to shop for himself. As far as he is concerned, Mr. Sax said, “I’m legal.”'"
"'09-09-03,'1','Or at least, he tries to.“It’s so slow, it feels like I’m on a dial-up modem,” he said. Shazam, an application that identifies songs being played on the radio or TV, takes so long to load that the tune may be over by the time the app is ready to hear it. On numerous occasions, Mr. Sbicca says, he missed invitations to meet friends because his had been delayed.And picking up a cell signal in his apartment? “You hit the dial button and the phone just sits there, saying it’s connecting for 30 seconds,” he said.More than 20 million other smartphone users are on the AT&T network, but other phones do not drain the network the way the nine million iPhones users do. Indeed, that is why the howls of protest are more numerous in the dense urban areas with higher concentrations of iPhone owners.“It’s almost worthless to try and get on 3G during peak times in those cities,” Mr. Munster said, referring to the 3G network. “When too many users get in the area, the call drops.” The problems seem particularly pronounced in New York and San Francisco, where Mr. Munster estimates AT&T’s network shoulders as much as 20 percent of all the iPhone users in the .Owners of the iPhone 3GS, the newest model, “have probably increased their usage by about 100 percent,” said Chetan Sharma, an independent wireless analyst. “It’s faster so they are using it more on a daily basis.”Mr. Sharma compares the problem to water flowing through a pipe. “It can only funnel so much at a given time,” he said. “It comes down to peak capacity loads, or spikes in data usage. That’s why you see these problems at conferences or in large cities with high concentration of iPhone users.”When thousands of iPhone owners descended on , Tex., in March during , an annual technology and music conference, attendees were unable to send text messages, check their e-mail or make calls until AT&T installed temporary cell sites to amplify the service.AT&T’s right to be the exclusive carrier for iPhone in the United States has been a golden ticket for the wireless company. The average iPhone owner pays AT&T $2,000 during his two-year contract — roughly twice the amount of the average mobile phone customer.But at the same time the iPhone has become an Achilles’ heel for the company.“It’s been a challenging year for us,” said John Donovan, the chief technology officer of AT&T. “Overnight we’re seeing a radical shift in how people are using their phones,” he said. “There’s just no parallel for the demand.”AT&T says that the majority of the nearly $18 billion it will spend this year on its networks will be diverted into upgrades and expansions to meet the surging demands on the 3G network. The company intends to erect an additional 2,100 cell towers to fill out patchy coverage, upgrade existing cell sites by adding fiber optic connectivity to deliver data faster and add other technology to provide stronger cell signals.As fast as AT&T wants to go, many cities require lengthy filing processes to erect new cell towers. Even after towers are installed, it can take several months for software upgrades to begin operating at faster speeds.The company has also delayed bandwidth-heavy features like multimedia messaging, or text messages containing pictures, audio or video. It is also postponing “tethering,” which allows the iPhone to share its Internet connection with a computer, a standard feature on many rival smartphones. AT&T says it has no intention of capping how much data iPhone owners use.The upgrades are expected to be completed by next year and the company has said it is already seeing improvements.But AT&T faces another cost — to its reputation. AT&T’s deal with is said to expire as early as next year, at which point other carriers in the United States would be able to sell the popular Apple phones. Indeed, a recent survey by found that 34 percent of respondents pinpointed AT&T as the primary reason for not buying an iPhone.“It’s a P.R. nightmare,” said Craig Moffett, a senior analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein & Company.AT&T might be in the spotlight now, analysts say, but other carriers will face similar problems as they sell more smartphones, laptop cards and eventually tablets that encourage high data usage.Globally, mobile data traffic is expected to double every year through 2013, according to , which makes network gear. “Whether an iPhone, a Storm or a Gphone, the world is changing.” Mr. Munster said. “We’re just starting to scratch the surface of these issues that AT&T is facing.”In preparation for the next wave of smartphones and data demands, all the carriers are rushing to introduce the next-generation of wireless networks, called 4G.Analysts expect that in a year or so, AT&T’s network will have improved significantly — but it may not be soon enough for some iPhone owners paying for the higher-priced data plans, like Mr. Sbicca, who says he plans to switch carriers as soon as the iPhone becomes available on other networks.“What good is having all those applications if you don’t have the speed to run them?” he said. “It’s not exactly rocket science here. It’s pretty standard stuff to be able to make a phone call.”'"
"'09-09-03,'1','Mr. Woolf, who has had to dismiss 5 of his 10 full-time employees and has lost 40 percent of his workload, looks forward to his monthly poker game. The games, his custom for 25 years, are with eight close friends ages 40 to 60, several of whom also run small businesses, including a bicycle shop and an advertising agency.“It’s just so much fun,” he said. “For five or six hours on a Friday evening, we more or less totally forget about the world. It’s really helpful.”So, too, he concedes somewhat sheepishly, is faithfully watching “American Idol” with his two daughters, ages 8 and 10. “It’s really relaxing and fun family time.”Given the many challenges of running a business in a recession, “it’s a life-and-death issue” to monitor and mitigate the effects of work-related anxiety, said Dr. Carol Scott, an emergency room physician who also helps business owners and their employees manage stress.Small-business owners, many of them motivated high achievers, tend to neglect their own health in the scramble to find and retain clients, she said. “You’ll cancel that doctor’s appointment and stop going to the gym,” she said. “Suddenly you’ll just collapse and wonder why.”Her suggestion for dealing with stress is to walk briskly for 30 minutes every day, even in three 10-minute segments.Lee Sellenraad, director of project development at Barton Malow, a commercial construction company in Ann Arbor, Mich., said his sense of history calms him. His company, with 1,700 employees, works nationwide only on commercial projects worth more than $10 million. While some sectors — like power plant construction — are booming, others are not. Mr. Sellenraad said he had survived tougher times when, in 2004, he went an entire year without an income.“My father grew up in the Netherlands in World War II, and my mother was Dutch,” he said. “They were used to a life of hiding, escaping the Germans, living on tulip bulbs. Their experience gives me some perspective.”To relax, Mr. Sellenraad said, he watches his 18-year-old son play varsity baseball, walks his neighborhood with his wife and works out at the gym as a body builder.Mr. Holzworth, 51, the technical writer, said fencing is his balm, and his driveway is his fencing strip. “We’ve had crowds,” he said. “Police cars have driven past the house slowly.” Being thought the neighborhood eccentric for his public swordplay does not diminish his enjoyment.“Fencing is incredibly physically demanding,” he said. “Any anxiety, stress or nervous tension that’s built up during the week just burns away with the first clash of blades. When I’m done, I’m exhausted but grounded.”Mr. Holzworth said he also plays chess one evening a week. “I find it very calming to be able to focus on a specific, well-structured challenge,” he said. “That, plus a glass of wine, makes a perfect evening.”Working at The Greenbrier resort, in White Sulphur Springs, W.Va., for 11 years meant many months of bad news, said Lynn Swann, its director of public relations. From 2003 to 2009, the luxury resort, which dates from 1778, lost $90 million. It is the largest employer, with 1,300 jobs, in a town of 2,000 and a county of 35,000 with few other opportunities.The resort filed for bankruptcy protection in March but was sold in May to Jim Justice, a prominent West Virginia businessman. Under Mr. Justice, the resort has begun construction of an underground gambling complex and is opening an additional restaurant on Oct. 1.The mood is more optimistic now, Ms. Swann said. But in the darkest days, “I just wanted to crawl into a hole,” she said. To manage her stress, Ms. Swann has tried everything: the soothing music of the Swiss harpist Andreas Vollenweider, reading thrillers, aromatherapy in her office, weekly papaya facial masks and plastering her office walls with inspirational quotations. Her 8-year-old daughter, she added, gives great hand massages.The emotional support of family members and friends — kind, calm, familiar and solid — is crucial, small-business owners agreed.Michael Cohen, founder and chief executive of the Santa Barbara Adventure Company, an 11-year-old business that offers kayaking, bicycling and other activities, has had a 10 to 15 percent decline in revenue and a huge jump recently in the number of competitors undercutting his prices. The school and corporate groups he relies on for business are cutting back, while six full-time and seven part-time employees rely on him.To relieve stress, his staff takes 10-mile hikes and long bike trips, he said. Mr. Cohen goes surfing, or straps on his 9-month-old son to take his 3-year-old for a hike to a local creek. “I’ve always relied on nature as a stress reliever,” he said.For Stacey Lund, already stuck behind the wheel of her sport utility vehicle for a two-hour daily commute to work from upstate New York, doughnuts and coffee do the trick. Ms. Lund relies on Tim Hortons, a Canadian chain with 536 stores in 11 states in the United States, for the comfort of something easy, familiar and affordable.She said she realized that if the doughnuts offered her comfort, they might do the same for others. So as she drives across northern New York selling advertising for Entercom Communications to seven local radio stations, she makes sure to bring a box.“Our business is very relationship-based,” she said. “Clients are pulling back their spending, and they have tons of other media reps calling on them. But as soon as they see I have a bag or box of goodies, their eyes light up.”'"
"'09-09-03,'1','Jane Scheckter, a singer with both feet on the ground, goes back to the source in her new cabaret act, “Play a Simple Melody: A Tribute to Irving Berlin,” at the Metropolitan Room. For a performer who over four decades has traveled many show-business byways (associations with Bette Midler and Barry Manilow, a stint in an Andrews Sisters-like female trio named Tuxedo Junction), that means both drawing from the well of the quintessential American songwriter of the pre-rock era and asserting herself as a no-frills pop-jazz swinger with her eyes wide open.With blunt emphatic phrasing, a matter-of-fact attitude and a bright but coarsened voice that doesn’t try to be pretty, Ms. Scheckter is no simpering romantic, although she confessed during Tuesday’s opening-night show to a lingering “delusional” crush on Tony Perkins. Accompanied by a solid pop-jazz trio — Tedd Firth on piano, Tom Hubbard on bass and Peter Grant on drums — she delivered brisk renditions of 20 Berlin standards strung together with mechanical patter that offered few fresh insights.Several interpretations of standards went against the conventional grain. Singing a rhythmically fortified “I Got Lost in His Arms,” a song that Barbara Cook, Stacey Kent and Victoria Clark all treat as a fairy-tale ending of sweet surrender, Ms. Scheckter made it clear that she was not about to let her guard down. Two songs associated with Fred Astaire — “Cheek to Cheek” and “Puttin’ on the Ritz” — instead of gliding on a polished dance floor, remained conspicuously earthbound.Ms. Scheckter’s resistance to pop sentimentality paid off in her plainspoken renditions of two classic Berlin waltzes, “Remember” and “What’ll I Do?,” in which her absence of vocal sweetness called attention to simple heartfelt lyrics, which speak for themselves. But the show was mostly about swinging along with one of the stronger cabaret trios. Especially when Ms. Scheckter leaned into a witty, happy-go-luck “I’m Putting All My Eggs in One Basket,” the beat was on.'"
"'09-09-03,'1','You’ve made the huge decision to start a business. As you probably know, most efforts to start a business end in failure. Fortunately, there are things you can do to guard against wasting time and money and improve your odds. While every business is unique and comes with its own set of problems and opportunities, there are some basic steps  writing a business plan, proving the concept, raising capital, choosing a legal structure  to consider when getting started. Let’s take a look:Writing a business plan seems like a chore, but it’s critical. It doesn’t have to be formal or long  just a few pages is fine. But try to cover the basic sections, especially if you expect to make a pitch to investors or lenders. These sections should include an overview of the business, industry background, the product or service, the business model (how will you make money?), the strategy and the team. For guidance, take a look at Score’s business plan template.Think of the process as a way to better understand the opportunity and the risks. It may even show you that the business is too tough. If that’s the case, you want to know it as soon as possible.Try to answer the following in the business plan:1) Who is the customer?Try to focus on a defined market segment. In some cases, it should be easy. Perhaps you are aiming at lawyers. But if your product applies to virtually anybody, you need to narrow things. Look at Amazon. At first, the Web company focused on books. Once it built a strong business there, it moved into other categories.So, where to start? Try to find the customer segment that is experiencing the most pain or is willing to bet on new ideas.Immerse yourself in the market. What are the major trends? How will they help or hurt your venture? Along with doing Google searches, you should also check out trade publications and association Web sites.If your business is in retail, look at ZoomProspector, which provides helpful information on local economic trends (population, income and demographics). Visit Yelp.com and see how many competing retail outlets you’ll be facing. Is the market too crowded?Finally, make a list of your competitors and update it regularly.3) What are the start-up costs?Be realistic. Entrepreneurs often underestimate the time and expense of starting and operating a company. Put together a detailed start-up budget as well as a forecast (Score’s template offers a worksheet).As you put things together, look for ways to minimize costs. Some ideas: shopping for used equipment on Craigslist, bartering your services, using free or inexpensive online applications like Skype (for free calling), Web.com (to setup a Web site) and VistaPrint (for printing business cards and brochures). Always ask for discounts.At the same time, think of creative ways to increase revenue. Maybe you can mount an online marketing campaign through Google Adwords or use VerticalResponse for an e-mail newsletter.Once you’re satisfied with the business plan, the next step is to test it. This means answering the question: Do customers really want to buy what you intend to sell?It’s a brutal question, but you need to be realistic.One idea is to talk to potential customers, but avoid your friends; instead, identify a list of likely customers and call them. The good news is that there are many free lists on the Internet. They include sites like CPAdirectory.com, Lawyers.com, Dentists.com and so on.While the calling is not glamorous, you’ll eventually get a sense of whether there’s demand. You will also get new ideas to refine your product, and you will build valuable sales skills, which is critical for anyone starting a business.Next, you can conduct a survey using an online service like Zoomerang, which has a panel of about two million people. You can designate groups with up to 500 attributes (industry, age, gender, income and so on). This is a quick way to get feedback on your business idea.Or, you can set up a free Web site and try selling your product. This was the approach for Sneaky’s BBQ, which set up a blog at sneakysbbq.blogspot.com. Believing that there were few good places for authentic barbecue in San Francisco, Patrick Wachter started to cook up his recipes in his backyard and put out free ads on Craigslist. It was a hit as word-of-mouth spread, helped along by review sites like Yelp. “We can’t even eat our own barbecue anymore,” Mr. Wachter said. “It’s already spoken for by the time we pull it off the smoker.”Here’s another example: Megan Calhoun saw that it was difficult to use online services to find other mothers. Deciding she wanted to “be fast, be cheap and see where it takes you,” she registered TwitterMoms.com, and instead of building a Web site, she used the free service Ning.com, which allows you to build your own social network. On the first night, four mothers joined, and from there, it grew and grew. Now she has 15,000 members and has attracted advertisers like Lands’ End, Children’s Place and even José Cuervo. The total cost to launch? Only $50.This is time-consuming and can distract your attention from the business. It can easily take six months to get your first investment. Investors are naturally hesitant and want to see proof that the business is viable.That means you will probably need to bootstrap. This is not easy but it does have the advantage of allowing you to keep more control and a larger equity stake.You can do things like: borrow against your 401(k), life insurance and house; use credit cards; and even do consulting projects.Next, you can reach out to your friends, family and colleagues. Even though they may trust you, it’s important that you have a convincing business plan and investor contracts. To this end, check out Virgin Money. This online service provides the necessary legal documents, administers the loan payments and makes reports to credit agencies (which will help build a credit history for the business).It’s tempting to seek financing from banks, angel groups and venture capitalists, but those sources usually look at more established businesses.If you are bringing on investors or partners or signing contracts, it’s a good idea to set up a legal structure for your venture. Here are the main alternatives:Sole Proprietorship: You are the sole owner. There is little red tape or expense. But there is a big downside: unlimited liability. If the business is the target of a lawsuit or owes a large debt, the owner’s personal assets are exposed to seizure.A sole proprietorship is known as a “pass through” entity. This means that the income is taxed on your personal return.Partnership: There is more than one owner. And as with the sole proprietorship, there is little paperwork involved and it is a pass-through entity for tax purposes. Unfortunately, partnerships also have unlimited liability exposure.Corporation: The fees can easily range from $200 to $1,000. Even though you can use cost-effective online services to help out, such as LegalZoom, it’s still a good idea to have a lawyer review the documents and filings. You can find a qualified attorney by visiting sites like Avvo.The main benefit is limited liability protection. This means that the business owner risks only the investment in the company.Keep in mind that there are different flavors of corporations, which are often based on how taxes are paid. For example, a limited liability company (L.L.C.) and S-Corp are pass-through entities. On the other hand, a C-Corp is taxed  and so are the dividends. Before making a decision, consult a certified public accountant. It can be a big money saver.Regardless of the legal structure, business owners should also think about the legal issues of the company name. It’s a good idea to find a name that is memorable and distinctive, but that is no easy task. Anders Heie, the founder of KaDonk said: “When thinking of a name, I hit my head against the wall and the sound it made was kadonk, kadonk, kadonk. Our lawyers loved it. It was unique, and had nothing to do with our product, so we grabbed all the domains and went with it.”A lawyer can help with the process.'"
"'09-09-03,'1','But Nadal, even at No. 3 and not quite at his relentless best, was far too much for Gasquet to handle, whipping ground strokes, scampering about the deep blue surface with no tape on either knee and holding serve with no drama as he did not allow Gasquet a break point.That was a tribute to Nadal’s biting left-handed serve and a reflection of the dubious form of the 46th-ranked Gasquet. After testing positive for a low level of cocaine in Miami after withdrawing from the Sony Ericsson Open in March, Gasquet pleaded his case with antidoping authorities, saying the cocaine entered his system when he kissed a woman who had used the drug.Gasquet could have been suspended for two years, but he was given a two-and-a-half-month suspension by an independent, three-member panel in July. The International Tennis Federation is appealing the reduced suspension to the Court of Arbitration for Sport, which means the possibility remains that Gasquet’s results for the rest of this season could be retroactively wiped out.“I’m not thinking about that,” Gasquet said. “I’m just happy to be back practicing and playing again.”Gasquet played two qualifying-round matches in New Haven last month, but the match Wednesday was his first in the main draw of an event since May, a stretch that he maintains has been the most difficult of his life. But Nadal helped generate some sunshine among the dark clouds by expressing his belief in Gasquet’s innocence at the French Open.“I would have loved not to play Rafa already, because he’s a great player and also because he did me a whole lot of good mentally when I was hurting,” Gasquet said Wednesday. “He allowed me to have better days. It’s always good to have support. It was really a pleasure to hear what he said, so it wasn’t easy for me to play him. In tennis terms, he was better than me, too, today.”The lopsided result was no surprise to those who have followed the arc of their lopsided rivalry. Outstanding juniors in Europe, they first played before they were teenagers, and though there was hope in France that Gasquet might prove to be a world beater when he grew up, Nadal has now won all seven of their matches as professionals. He will face Nicolas Kiefer, a German veteran, in the second round.“I felt good, very positive,” said Nadal, who said he played without pain in his knees. “I served well. The backhand was working well, the forehand more or less. I think everything was good, but the forehand can get better.”Not every champion’s knees are on the mend, however. Venus Williams continued to play through evident discomfort Wednesday. With her left leg heavily taped to support her ailing knee, Williams moved gingerly in the early phases of her second-round encounter with her fellow American Bethanie Mattek-Sands. But she seemed to move more fluidly and serve more aggressively as the match progressed and won, 6-4, 6-2.“It’s September now; I started literally in December, so I guess it’s not a huge surprise that at this time of the year things start to be a little sore and start to hurt,” Williams said. “But you know I’m very determined to play still my best tennis in spite of anything.”Williams’s left knee was already troubling her at Wimbledon. She played with it taped for most of the tournament, which did not keep her from reaching the final without losing a set. She was beaten there by her younger sister Serena.Their father and coach, Richard Williams, would like to see them withdraw from the doubles here to allow Venus time to recover and prepare herself for the tough singles matches to come.Those could include a fourth-round match with the resurgent Kim Clijsters, the Belgian who is in the midst of a true comeback after childbirth and continued to impress Wednesday by defeating No. 14 seed Marion Bartoli of France, 5-7, 6-1, 6-2.“Your body can only take the pain and the pressure for so long,” Richard Williams said.But Venus, who has declined to confirm reports that her problem is patellar tendinitis, said she intended to play doubles, too, just as she did at Wimbledon, where she and Serena won the title.“Doubles for me is a major title,” Venus said. “I love winning majors, so it’s not a decision I take lightly.”FEDERER MARCHES ON Roger Federer, seeking his sixth Open title, defeated Simon Greul of Germany, 6-3, 7-5, 7-5, on Wednesday night to advance to the third round. Federer will face the 31st-seeded Lleyton Hewitt, who cruised past Juan Ignacio Chela, 6-3, 6-3, 6-4.Greul, ranked 65th in the world entering the tournament and as low as 208th a year ago, played aggressively in the second and third sets, attacking Federer’s serve, but could not overcome Federer’s changes of pace.Second-seeded Serena Williams clobbered Melinda Czink of Hungary, 6-1, 6-1, in a 53-minute match in which the lopsided score did not do justice to the dominance she exhibited DAVID WALDSTEIN'"
"'09-09-03,'1','Agassi’s successor, Roddick, was the focal point of a USA Today graphic that featured video and stills of “the fastest serve in tennis.” His form is being closely watched after his epic five-set final with Roger Federer at Wimbledon this summer. But two players who weren’t at the All England Club — Richard Gasquet and Rafael Nadal — are the subjects of Bonnie D. Ford’s column on ESPN.com. Gasquet and Nadal are third up on Arthur Ashe on Wednesday.While quality of play will be the centerpiece of the Gasquet-Nadal matchup, the New York Post’s Anahita Moussavian was focused on players’ apparel. The review? Not so positive. Not so fast, however, said CBSSports.com’s Art Spander. Fashion included, the tournament, he said, was “the most exciting place in the country” right now.Liz Clarke talks of that “exciting place” in her piece on Washingtonpost.com featuring Roddick’s triumphant opening-night appearance and the return of Novak Djokovic, the enemy of New York fans at last year’s Open. Enemy or not, The Times of London’s Barry Flatman says New Yorkers should learn to love Djokovic — he could be around awhile.American men — or boys — trying to follow in Roddick’s footsteps include Jordan Cox, whose home-school upbringing was the subject of an article on Monday. Cox was schooled on the court last week, losing his first-round qualifying match in two sets at Flushing Meadows.The teenager Chase Buchanan of Ohio was also schooled, winning just three games against Jo-Wilfried Tsonga in their first round, main draw clash. Perhaps neither American player was as embarrassed as this ball boy, who tripped over an advertisement sign during the Murray-Ernests Gulbis match.Martin Rogers of Yahoo Sports wants Murray to be more offensive-minded, while London’s The Guardian gave the Scot’s first round performance a decent review. The Los Angeles Times’s Bill Dwyre had nothing but good words for the Southern California favorite Sam Querrey, who also won his first-round match on Tuesday.In what may or may not be an upset in New York, the tennis always seems to come back to fashion — at least for the first few days. This time, it’s Venus Williams’s organic cotton green T-shirt versus rapper Jay-Z’s limited edition Arthur Ashe design. Winner? It’s really a toss-up.'"
"'09-09-03,'1','Amy W. Schulman, Pfizer’s general counsel, said that Pfizer had reformed — again.“The reasons to trust Pfizer are because, as I have walked the halls at Pfizer, you would see that the vast majority of our employees spend their lives dedicated to bringing truly important medications to patients and physicians in an appropriate manner,” she said.The government charged that executives and sales representatives throughout Pfizer’s ranks planned and executed schemes to illegally market not only Bextra but also Geodon, an antipsychotic; Zyvox, an ; and Lyrica, which treats . While the government said the fine was a record sum, the $2.3 billion fine amounts to less than three weeks of Pfizer’s sales.Much of the activities cited Wednesday occurred while Pfizer was in the midst of resolving allegations that it illegally marketed , an drug for which the company in 2004 paid a $430 million fine and signed a corporate integrity agreement — a companywide promise to behave.John Kopchinski, a former Pfizer sales representative whose complaint helped prompt the government’s Bextra case, said that company managers told him and others to dismiss concerns about the Neurontin case while pushing them to undertake similar illegal efforts on behalf of Bextra.“The whole culture of Pfizer is driven by sales, and if you didn’t sell drugs illegally, you were not seen as a team player,” said Mr. Kopchinski, whose personal share of the Pfizer settlement is expected to exceed $50 million. Mr. Kopchinski left Pfizer in 2003.Altogether, six whistle-blowers will collect $102 million from the federal share of the settlement and more from states’ shares. Forty-nine states and the will collect $331 million, with alone getting $66 million. Only chose not to participate in the settlement.As news of the riches earned by whistle-blowers spread through the industry in recent years, scores of fraud cases have been filed by former drug sales representatives using a Civil War-era law that pays a bounty for fraud alerts. The cases charge that illegal drug marketing cost the federal and program millions.Under the agreement with the Justice Department, Pfizer will pay a $1.3 billion criminal penalty related to Bextra and $1 billion in civil fines related to other medicines. In addition, a Pfizer subsidiary, Pharmacia and Upjohn, will plead guilty to violating the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act for its promotion of Bextra. The company has agreed to sign another corporate integrity agreement that requires senior company executives to annually certify legal compliance and mandates that Pfizer post on its Web site many of its payments to doctors.Consumer advocates heaped scorn on Pfizer and said that illegal marketing was still common in the drug industry.“Consumers should ask their doctor whether the medication being prescribed is F.D.A.-approved for their condition,” advised Lisa Gill, editor of Consumer Reports Best Buy Drugs. If a drug is not approved for their condition, patients should press their doctors to explain their reasoning for the drug’s use.Almost every major drug maker has been accused in recent years of giving kickbacks to doctors or shortchanging federal programs. Prosecutors said that they had become so alarmed by the growing criminality in the industry that they had begun increasing fines into the billions of dollars and would more vigorously prosecute doctors as well.Dr. Scott Gottlieb, a top F.D.A. official in the Bush administration who now consults for drug makers, said that government prosecutors were increasingly criminalizing “what reasonable people might argue is a reasonable exchange of important clinical information between drug companies and doctors.”Bextra was approved in 2001 by the to treat and . The drug was not approved for the treatment of acute pain, nor was it shown to be any more powerful than ibuprofen. But Pfizer instructed its sales representatives to tell doctors that the drug could be used to treat acute and surgical pain and at doses well above those approved, even though the drug’s dangers — which included kidney, skin and heart risks — increased with the dose, the government charged. The drug was withdrawn in 2005 because of its risks to the heart and skin.“Among other things, Pfizer did the following: Pfizer invited doctors to consultant meetings, many in resort locations. Attendees expenses were paid; they received a fee just for being there,” he said. Such weekend getaways for doctors are still common throughout the drug and medical device industries.Top Republican officials rarely publicized drug marketing cases or appeared during news conferences about them. agreed to pay $1.4 billion over its marketing of Zyprexa, an antipsychotic, in January, before took office.

"'09-09-03,'1','MEHTAR LAM, Afghanistan  The second-ranking intelligence official in Afghanistan was killed by a suicide bomber on Wednesday morning, in an explosion that killed at least 15 other people outside the main mosque here in the official’s hometown, officials and witnesses said.The intelligence official, Abdullah Laghmani, was the deputy director of Afghanistan’s National Directorate for Security and a prominent ally of President Hamid Karzai. Afghan officials and colleagues conceded that his death was a severe blow to the fight against the Taliban and Al Qaeda.A spokesman for the Taliban in Afghanistan claimed responsibility within hours of the explosion. The spokesman, Zabihullah Mujahid, said Taliban fighters had long sought to kill Mr. Laghmani, blaming him for detentions and jailings in Kandahar Province, where he was head of intelligence in the province, the Taliban’s heartland, from 2003 to 2004.“We were looking for him for a long time, but today we succeeded,” Mr. Mujahid said.The assassination of such a powerful member of the country’s security apparatus highlighted the overall lack of security in the country, even in cities like Mehtar Lam, where the Taliban have not carried out an attack of this scale before.Two senior officials of Laghman Province were killed in the attack, as were a leading religious figure in the area and at least a dozen civilians, including three women. Mr. Laghmani was killed about 9:30 a.m. as he left the main mosque in the center of Mehtar Lam, the capital of Laghman Province, which is 60 miles east of Kabul. He had returned home during Ramadan and was helping to refurbish the mosque.Mr. Laghmani was accustomed to mingling with people on his visits home, provincial officials said, and the bomber managed to catch him while his guard was down. He had just left the mosque, surrounded by a crowd of officials, security guards and local men. As he was getting into his armored sport utility vehicle, the suicide bomber ran toward him and detonated his explosives, said Lutfullah Mashal, the provincial governor.The blast ripped away the passenger side of Mr. Laghmani’s vehicle and damaged one of his security contingent’s vehicles a few feet away. Shrapnel struck bystanders at a nearby marketplace and shredded a large poster of Mr. Laghmani posing with Mr. Karzai and provincial officials.“In Laghman, he was regarded as a respected elder,” Mr. Mashal said. “But as an intelligence expert he knew a lot about Al Qaeda, and he was a person who was very actively fighting against the Taliban, against Al Qaeda, in the 34 provinces of Afghanistan. He was leading in managing most of the activities of this directorate, so his loss is really a major loss for the country, and especially for the province of Laghman.”In Kabul, Mr. Karzai’s office released a statement describing Mr. Laghmani and the senior Laghman officials who were killed as “brave, hard-working and patriotic.”Gen. Nur ul-Haq Ulumi, a retired military officer and a member of the Afghan Parliament’s defense committee, described Mr. Laghmani’s death as a “big loss for Afghanistan, especially for the security sector,” citing his experience and the network of relationships he had built over the years.“When we lose people like him it shows that we are vulnerable,” General Ulumi said. “It is the weakness of our security organs that they are not organized enough to take care of their own security, especially when they are going among the public.”Dr. Abdul Latif Qaumi, the head of public health in the province, said 16 people had been killed and 56 wounded, 20 of them critically. He said that the small 100-bed provincial hospital had been overwhelmed by the number of dead and wounded, and that some families might have taken dead relatives home for burial without notifying the local authorities. Sayed Ahmad Safi, a provincial spokesman, said that the death toll was 23, The Associated Press reported.By midafternoon, gravediggers were already at work on a hillside outside the town.Despite the Taliban’s claim of responsibility, Mr. Mashal, the provincial governor, said that the bombing was so brutal that foreign jihadists were probably involved. “I am sure it is extremists, these so-called global jihadists, and Al Qaeda has a definite hand behind this incident,” he said at the scene of the explosion.Mr. Laghmani, who was in his 40s, served as an intelligence official with the Northern Alliance in the 1990s, when it opposed the Taliban government. After the fall of the Taliban in 2001, he joined the Directorate of Security and served in Kandahar. He was later appointed deputy chief in charge of operations in eastern Afghanistan.An ethnic Pashtun, he was particularly knowledgeable about the Taliban and the movement’s mentors in Pakistan. He and his agents helped determine the link between the bombers who attacked the Indian Embassy in Kabul in July 2008 and the Pakistani intelligence service, tracing a cellphone found in the wreckage to a facilitator in Kabul who was in direct telephone contact with a Pakistani intelligence official in Peshawar.Pakistani officials repeatedly accused Mr. Laghmani of undermining their national security. The Pakistani government once asked Mr. Karzai to remove him from office and hand him over so he could face charges in Pakistan. Mr. Karzai declined the request.'"
"'09-09-03,'1','ATHENS — A powerful car bomb rocked the Athens Stock Exchange on Wednesday, badly damaging parts of the building, setting eight vehicles ablaze and slightly wounding a private security guard, the police said.The blast came 40 minutes after a smaller bomb exploded outside a government building in Thessaloniki, northern Greece, causing minor damage but no injuries.Both attacks Wednesday were preceded by warning calls made by anonymous callers. Officials said they did not believe the two were linked.There was no immediate claim of responsibility for either, but police and counterterrorism officials said they suspected the Athens blast was set off by Revolutionary Struggle, a far-left militant group that fired a rocket at the United States Embassy here two years ago.A spokesman for the national police spokesman, Panayiotis Stathis, said the Thessaloniki bombing was suspected to be the work of a local militant group.Officials at the stock exchange quickly said that trading would proceed as normal in both Greece and Cyprus, which share a trading platform.'"

"'09-09-04,'1','Most of its work force, however, will move to the Newport office complex on the Jersey City waterfront.A spokesman for Depository Trust said a final decision had not been made. New York officials still hope they can steer the company to Pierrepont Plaza in Brooklyn Heights, instead of Jersey City.“We don’t think it’s over yet.” said Sheldon Silver, the Assembly speaker, whose district includes Lower Manhattan, “but I believe they’re willing to keep at least 700 downtown. We’re trying for more.”The bruising campaign to keep Depository Trust, which clears and trades securities for many brokerage firms and banks, was a test of Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg’s policy of refusing to give in to demands from companies playing one state against another. But the outcome also raises questions about the future role of Lower Manhattan as an international financial center.For decades, financial firms have been migrating from the city’s historic financial district to shiny skyscrapers in Midtown, or less expensive towers in Jersey City and Stamford, Conn.But Depository Trust’s decision to join them, at least in part, comes only weeks after the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation said it would leave Lower Manhattan for the Empire State Building. At the same time, downtown stalwarts like American International Group, the troubled insurance giant, and Merrill Lynch are shrinking their presence. And JPMorgan Chase has put its skyscraper, Chase Manhattan Plaza, up for sale.In December, New Jersey granted Tullett Prebon, a British financial firm, $16.5 million in incentives for agreeing to move 330 jobs to the west side of the Hudson from Lower Manhattan.“For more than half a century, the Lower Manhattan economy has been undergoing change,” said Mitchell L. Moss, a professor of policy and urban planning at New York University. “The epicenter of finance has moved to new locations.”Indeed, downtown, which often looked deserted at the end of a work day, has become far more lively and diverse as thousands of residents moved into converted office buildings. Over the past five years, a vast majority of companies moving downtown have been law firms, nonprofits, technology and new media, not financial services, said Jonathan Bowles, director of the Center for an Urban Future, a nonpartisan research group in Manhattan.“We need to be much more strategic about the kinds of companies that we’re trying to attract to Lower Manhattan right now,” Mr. Bowles said. “I believe that Lower Manhattan is a much more attractive place today.”Mr. Silver, and some city officials, contend that Lower Manhattan is still feeling the effects of the recession. The financial industry will bounce back with the economy, they insist, and Midtown financial firms seeking cheaper space will move downtown, where rents traditionally are 30 percent lower.But New York is still vulnerable to New Jersey, which offers generous incentives and where real estate costs are already lower. In February, New Jersey’s development authority offered Depository Trust a package worth $74.6 million over 10 years if it moved 1,600 employees to Jersey City when its Manhattan lease expires in 2012.City and state officials in New York later met with the company to fashion a counter-offer. But city officials drew the line at offering the company a set of customized subsidies.Their policy is supported by many economists and civic groups who argue that it is more important to improve transit and the overall business climate than to get into a bidding war for jobs.“We’re glad the company is maintaining its headquarters here,” said Deputy Mayor Robert C. Lieber.“But,” he added, “we’re not about to use scarce taxpayer dollars to chase irresponsible enticements that other places may be willing to give away. We’re better off investing that money.”'"

"'09-09-04,'1','The confetti was still falling at the Guy R. Brewer United Democratic Club, a fluorescent-lit hall on a street with neat two-story houses and sandwich shops protected by bulletproof glass, but the Queens volunteers were looking ahead. They wanted to turn their amorphous sense of newfound power into tangible change close to home — better schools, fewer foreclosures, new blood in local government — and now they felt strong enough to try.“A lot of these local politicians need to watch out,” Marvin Griffin, 28, a school administrator, shouted over the cheers. “This has brought a whole new crowd into politics.”It is too soon to tell whether newly minted activists like these will change politics across the country. But it is clear that in southeast Queens, the campaign unleashed forces that have begun to shift the landscape.Within weeks, Mr. Whitehead was wondering if he should dare to spend this precious capital — the momentum of a unique moment in history — on a new, perhaps more challenging mission. He was contemplating a frontal assault on the powerful local Democratic Party establishment. Critics and even some of its leaders call it the machine.The Obama campaign resonated in southeast Queens, an overwhelmingly black and Democratic district where many voters felt they had made a difference in a national election for the first time. Neighborhoods like Hollis and St. Albans look like archetypal small-town America, with sidewalks, gardens and friendly neighbors. It is a bastion of black homeownership but has pockets of poverty and has been hit hard by foreclosures.Like countless others from Harlem, the South and the Caribbean, Donald M. Whitehead moved to St. Albans for “a house you can walk around.”Mr. Whitehead was born in Ahoskie, N.C., to a logger and a factory worker. A schoolteacher took him to civil rights marches; the soaring metaphors of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. inspired him to read about history.In 1964, he moved to Harlem, calling himself Donald 23X. He absorbed street politics from Malcolm X and insider politics from Adam Clayton Powell Jr. But he was too independent — some might say bullheaded — to sign on with any one group.He and his wife, Jo-Ann Floyd-Whitehead — a math teacher he met at a dude ranch — moved to St. Albans in 1976. In the 1980s, they protested a racially charged killing in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn. Mr. Whitehead ran for the school board on a United African Party ticket.But mainly, they became neighborhood troubleshooters. As activist public school parents, they tutored local children in their garage, refitted as a sunlit meeting place. If a favorite principal was fired or an after-school program closed, people went there to plan a response.The Whiteheads and Mr. Byfield worked in 2007 to get Mr. Obama on the ballot. When a Queens campaign office opened in January 2008, the Whiteheads pulled in all their neighborhood contacts, as volunteers converging from around Queens tapped their own networks.The effect was electric, said Joyce Johnson, the campaign’s New York State field director.“When you don’t know politics, you’re not scared of it,” Ms. Johnson said. “They were not intimidated by the political establishment. They simply said, ‘They’re wrong.’ They tapped into community like I have never seen.”Mr. Obama won 56 percent of the primary vote in the Sixth Congressional District, which covers most of southeast Queens. It was one of two districts in the state that gave him a majority, and thus three of the district’s five delegates in a race in which every one counted. It was a shock, Ms. Johnson said, because the pro-Clinton power structure was so strong. In southeast Queens, she said, the machine usually works.The day after Mr. Obama won the presidency, Mr. Byfield took out an American flag he had found in his house when he moved in 1970. A citizen for 35 years, he had sent his four children to Ivy League colleges, but never felt moved to unfurl the flag. That night he hung it on his door; it had only 48 stars.“For the first time,” he said, “I felt really part of America.”But as the bunting was cleared from the Brewer Club — the power center of the local party establishment, which backed Mr. Obama in the general election — a new conflict was brewing.Mr. Whitehead wanted new candidates to challenge the club-endorsed officials, elected year after year by the handful of party faithful who bother to vote and who populate the civic groups he had worked with over the years.“Anytime you’re in a group where everybody’s over 60, it’s time for me to leave,” he said. “Most of these groups, every year they do a big, fancy dinner dance, and that’s it.” He chuckled. “Electric slide.”Someone who won office by going door to door — really listening to people who had never been part of the political circuit — would be better at solving neighborhood problems, he believed.The person he had in mind was Brian Simon, 27, another Obama campaigner. Mr. Simon was a senior aide to the local congressman, Gregory W. Meeks, but for several years Mr. Whitehead had been his mentor and a father figure. The two often talked politics at a diner late into the night. Mr. Simon wanted elected office so badly he had prayed for it at the Western Wall in Jerusalem. He was eyeing a City Council seat.But there was a catch. The Council had just approved Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg’s bid to revise term limits. Now, if Mr. Simon ran, he would be challenging a kindly man, an insider who was expert at delivering city money to his district: the two-term councilman, Leroy Comrie, who had voted to free Mr. Bloomberg, and himself, to run again.In effect, Mr. Simon would be taking on the whole Queens Democratic organization. To party veterans, it is a well-oiled mechanism to turn out voters; detractors contend that the officials it helps elect reward loyalty with jobs and financing for favorite organizations, stifling debate.Mr. Whitehead recalls Mr. Simon worrying that if he challenged the incumbent, the party could sabotage his career. Mr. Simon strongly denies this.The obstacles only tantalized Mr. Whitehead. Overturning term limits approved twice in voter referendums was tantamount to stripping New Yorkers of the right to vote, he said. But he would not pressure Mr. Simon.So in December, when dozens of volunteers fired up for the next mission met in the Whiteheads’ basement — they no longer fit in the garage — Mr. Whitehead and Mr. Simon proposed something much less confrontational. The volunteers would create the Frederick Douglass Institute, a grass-roots research center, to study issues — policing, education, political accountability — and promote policies they liked.Deep down, Mr. Whitehead still wanted to try the impossible. “You have to believe in a dream world,” he said.In Washington for the inauguration, Mr. Whitehead surveyed the crowds.“All the people in power” thought Mr. Obama should wait his turn, Mr. Whitehead remarked. But Mr. Obama “understood the zeitgeist,” he said, and picked the right moment.The wheels in Mr. Whitehead’s mind were turning.Back home, he found a neighborhood in crisis. A judge had upheld the term-limits change, and people were angry. On his block, several people had lost jobs, and foreclosures had crowded three generations into a single house.Now he pushed Mr. Simon hard. “He read to me about ‘the fierce urgency of now,’ ” Mr. Simon recalled. Mr. Obama too had quoted the phrase of Dr. King.Mr. Whitehead recalls saying, “If they could tell you to sit down for four years and be quiet, then you’re finished. If you’re not a warrior at 27, when are you going to be a warrior?”Mr. Simon would not budge. He says he never feared retaliation, but thought running would be “toxic” and divisive and could deprive the district of an effective legislator. “I put my community first,” he says.Mr. Whitehead reminded him that he had nothing against Mr. Comrie, saying, “It’s not the individual, it’s the principle.”In February, City Comptroller William C. Thompson Jr., running for mayor, spoke in the Whiteheads’ basement. The volunteers noted their new clout, and the visit attracted newcomers. One was Clyde Vanel, 35. He wanted to run for City Council.Mr. Vanel was the son of Haitian immigrants. A lawyer in Manhattan and an owner of an East Village restaurant, Permanent Brunch, he was not an obvious partner for Donald 23X.But they talked for hours. Both saw a one-time chance to attract new voters, and Mr. Vanel won Mr. Whitehead’s highest praise: “A hard worker.”Mr. Simon pleaded with Mr. Whitehead not to deploy his network for Mr. Vanel. He wanted to run in 2013. Mr. Whitehead realized he might have to abandon the man he had nurtured.“It’s like if you’re sitting on a nail,” said Ronald Summers Sr., a transit employee and an Obama volunteer. “You see an opportunity to get up off that nail, and someone says, I want you to sit back down and wait four years.”The deciding moment came when people walked into the Whiteheads’ basement with a message from the Democratic club. Mr. Whitehead will not say who the people were, and club leaders deny sending anyone.

"'09-09-04,'1','Faced with what he called “political blackmail,” Mr. Karamanlis emerged Wednesday to say that he would not tolerate serving as a lame-duck prime minister.“It would be irresponsible of me to allow the country and its economy to drag on through a torrid six-month pre-election period,” Mr. Karamanlis said in a 15-minute address broadcast nationwide. “It would be detrimental for a country requiring necessary reforms and political calm.”His alternative — snap elections, expected to be held as early as Oct. 4 — would put voters at a clear crossroads, he said, making them choose between the “tough but responsible policies” of his center-right government and the Socialists’ populist promises that could “exacerbate the current crisis.”He swept aside a generation of Socialist governments when he surged to power in 2004, promising to rule both “modestly” and “humbly,” and to clean up crooked finances and public life.But since his anemic victory in snap elections in 2007, his government, with a one-seat margin in Parliament, has been plagued by corruption scandals, political turmoil and social unrest over economic policies that uncorked violent protests in December.So Mr. Karamanlis’s decision to call for early elections, despite the public opposition of some senior members of his cabinet, has puzzled political analysts.“It’s not the first time snap elections have been called,” said Yannis Pretenderis, a political commentator for To Vima, a newspaper in Athens. “It’s just the first time they are being called by a prime minister heading for an election defeat.”Mr. Karamanlis said that a prolonged election period, and the traditional handouts and easing of fiscal policy that come with it, would be detrimental for an economy that was already struggling.But other analysts dismissed his call for early elections as a cynical ploy in which he is using the economy as a pretext for his own political survival.“At a time when the economy is sinking, Karamanlis is abandoning the ship, leaving his mates — Greek voters struggling through the economic downturn — without a lifeline of support,” George Kyrtsos, a political commentator and publisher of the newspaper City Press, said in an interview.“Rather than push through an aid package and stick to his guns,” he said, “Karamanlis preferred to call elections, saddle his political foes with the ensuing chaos, allowing him to prepare his next move: a political comeback.”Senior cabinet ministers and analysts said the beleaguered prime minister was initially considering a sweeping cabinet shuffle. But he changed course, they said, after economic forecasters warned that the country’s finances were getting worse, and that a cabinet shuffle would not be enough to change them.The Greek government is being pressed by the European Commission to adopt belt-tightening measures to reduce this year’s budget deficit to below the mandated ceiling of 3 percent of gross domestic product, improve competitiveness and severely cut its ballooning public debt.Greece has already borrowed more than 50 billion euros, about $71 billion, this year to finance its deficit, which is expected to exceed 6 percent of G.D.P., according to a draft budget for 2010.Breaking the conservatives’ lead in polls since 2004, the Socialist party, known as Pasok, has seen its political fortunes blossom in recent months.A flurry of opinion polls over the weekend showed Pasok with a 6 percent lead. But it remained unclear whether it would garner enough votes to win an outright majority and govern alone.“Either way,” Mr. Kyrtsos said, “Karamanlis’s time is up. Greece is turning a new page in its political history.”'"
"'09-09-04,'1','Optiver describes itself as one of the world’s leading liquidity providers, a trading firm that uses its own capital to make markets. It seeks to profit on razor-thin price differences — which can be as small as half a penny — by buying and selling stocks, bonds, futures, options and derivatives. (Derivatives represent about 65 percent of its business, equities 25 percent, and commodities and others make up the remaining 10 percent.)But the extent to which market making (providing liquidity to markets that need it) and proprietary trading (the pursuit of pure profit with a firm’s own money) can properly coexist has become a thorny question for regulators. They are grappling with an exploding business that makes up as much as half the overall trading in the United States and a growing share in Europe as well.Tanno Massar, a public relations executive working for the company, said that Optiver had no comment on the case. As for Optiver’s trading conduct, Mr. Massar said that the company was committed to transparent markets and that there was no inherent conflict between pursuing profits and making markets — a view that top Optiver officials had long been trying to convey to regulators when their oil trades were being investigated.But their pleadings fell on deaf ears. During a tense conference call in 2007, Thomas Lasala, the chief regulator for Nymex, made his doubts clear about Optiver’s trading strategies.“The market seems to move in reaction to your orders,” he said, according to a transcript of the conversation. “And I don’t think that is a market-making strategy.”It could well be that Optiver’s cowboy trading tactics are unique to the company. But as concern grows over the effect that high-octane computerized trading is having on markets worldwide, Optiver’s conduct in the oil futures market raises questions as to whether the relentless competition of this business is forcing companies to engage in similar practices.“These are proprietary trading shops that are masquerading as market makers,” said Tim Quast of Modern IR, a consulting firm that advises corporations on market structure issues.The Securities and Exchange Commission has opened up an investigation into high-speed-trading practices, in particular the ability of some of the most powerful computers to jump to the head of the trading queue and — in a fraction of a millisecond — capture the evanescent trading spread before the rest of the market does.The spread of high-frequency trading in Europe has lagged behind the United States. But it is now experiencing rapid growth, spurred by arbitrage opportunities that have attracted large American firms like Getco and Madison Tyler.Amsterdam, as much as if not more than London, has been the breeding ground for local firms seeking the same advantages. Companies like Optiver, All Options, Tibra and others have assumed influential positions in Europe, moving from their original expertise in trading options to the full gamut of stocks, bonds and derivatives as well.Called low-latency trading, this blend of speed and opportunism is the essence of Optiver’s business model.It deploys a sophisticated software system called F1 that can process information and make a trade in 0.5 milliseconds — using complex algorithms that let its computers think like a trader. And the company is so careful about preserving its secrets that when some traders and engineers left for a rival operation recently, Optiver hired private investigators and subsequently sued the former employees on charges of making off with intellectual property.Founded in 1986 by an options trader named Johann Kaemingk, Optiver has grown far beyond its roots in Amsterdam to trade on exchanges all over the world. It employs 600 people and, judging from the many positions advertised on its Web site, it is still in a hiring mode.Given the vicious competition that exists in the industry, Optiver and other companies have become creative in attracting the smartest people in finance. The dress code is aggressively casual. The company provides free breakfasts, lunches and Friday afternoon drinks, as well as chair massages.And in one recruiting Web video (no longer online), an Optiver trader sitting before four giant trading screens is seen ogling two skimpily clad women as they sit on his thighs.To enjoy these professional fruits, applicants need to subject themselves to three math-based tests to test facility with numbers and the ability to think clearly under pressure. For one of the tests, 80 questions must be answered in under 8 minutes. Sample questions include 0.034 times 0.2, or, if you have a cube made of 10 by 10 smaller cubes, how many are facing the outside?Few of the applicants even get an interview: 80 to 90 percent of people who take the test fail it. People who have worked at Optiver say the average age is young — under 30 — as the company has a policy of not hiring traders from rival institutions, preferring recent university graduates who can more easily embrace the firm’s culture.According to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which would not comment on the case, Optiver made about $1 million on its oil trading gambit.While $1 million may not seem like a lot, recorded conversations reveal the extent to which the firm’s trading practices broadly have enriched its employees.In one exchange, Christopher Dowson, head of trading in Optiver’s Chicago office and the mastermind behind the oil strategy, bragged to another employee about how he had bought a new speed boat with his share of the returns.“With these profits, might have to get a bigger one,” he said.And in another, Mr. Dowson acknowledges that Optiver was so aggressive in conducting its proprietary trades in some smaller stocks that their activities “were as big as the volume traded on the day.”It is precisely this — high-powered computers and the swagger of those who operate them — that is causing worries over high-frequency trading’s increasing sway.“The markets used to be about capital formation,” said Mr. Quast, the consultant. “Now 80 percent of trading is driven by some form of statistical arbitrage. We are buying into a statistical house of cards that could unravel very quickly.”'"
"'09-09-04,'1','The cautionary tale of Joel Tenenbaum continues. Weeks after he was ordered to pay $675,000 to record labels for illegally downloading and sharing music, those labels are saying that Mr. Tenenbaum, 25, a graduate student at Boston University, is continuing to encourage music piracy by linking to a file-sharing service on a Web site created by his legal team, The Boston Globe reported. A Twitter feed for the site, joelfightsback.com, posted a link to the Swedish file-sharing service the Pirate Bay. That site, whose founders were convicted in April by a Swedish court of aiding in copyright violations, posted “The $675,000 Mixtape,” a playlist that linked to the songs that Mr. Tenenbaum admitted to downloading illegally and featured a photograph of him with his arms crossed. The Recording Industry Association of America has filed for an injunction that would order Mr. Tenenbaum to destroy his illegal files and stop promoting piracy. Mr. Tenenbaum said that he had nothing to do with the song list on the Pirate Bay and that he planned to appeal his verdict and fine.'"

"'09-09-05,'0','On July 7, the N.B.A. announced a modest decline in the 2009-10 salary cap, and warned teams of a potentially large drop — up to 5 percent — for 2010-11. At that moment, Walsh said, he scuttled any plans to offer multiyear contracts to free agents, including Lee and Robinson.“That changed everything,” he said. “It made it very difficult to project a scenario where you could fit in signing long-term contracts this year and yet have enough room to do what you want next year. Up to then, I wasn’t set against it all the way.”Indeed, Walsh had offered three-year deals to both Kidd and Hill (as well as options for one-year contracts). Given the shrinking salary cap, the Knicks are probably better off having missed on both players.Assuming the cap drops to $50 million in 2010 — the worst-case possibility outlined by the league — the Knicks would have just enough room to sign one superstar (for about $15 million), and about $7 million left to fill out the roster. They have only six players under contract for the 2010-11 season.Had they signed Kidd and Hill to multiyear deals, it could have left the Knicks with as little as $14 million in cap room in 2010, eliminating them from the potential LeBron James sweepstakes.So the rest of Walsh’s summer was shaped by a new reality. He made overtures to two talented point guards, Miller and Sessions, but both balked at one-year offers. Miller signed with the Portland Trail Blazers for three years and $21 million. Sessions appears on the verge of joining the Minnesota Timberwolves for four years at $16 million, unless the Milwaukee Bucks choose to match the offer.Most awkwardly for Walsh, Lee and Robinson also remain unsigned, with training camp just a little more than three weeks away. But the strong sense among team officials and people close to both players is that they will sign one-year deals by the end of the month. The agents for Lee and Robinson are trying to exhaust all other possibilities first.“Either a sign and trade will get done here in the next month, or we’ll find a deal that makes sense for everybody on a one-year basis,” Lee’s agent, Mark Bartelstein, said.Walsh acknowledged the situation was not ideal. The Knicks badly want to keep Lee and have an investment in Robinson’s development. Walsh has maintained a constant dialogue with their agents, “so they know it’s just a matter of getting it together at the right time.”Lee once sought a multiyear contract averaging $12 million a year. But only a few teams had substantial cap space and it disappeared quickly, robbing Lee of any bargaining power. Bartelstein said the Knicks have declined a number of sign-and-trade deals, but a team official said no team had made a formal offer.The Knicks are hoping to retain Lee for $6 million to $8 million this season, and revisit talks next summer, when he will be an unrestricted free agent. Walsh will then face the same challenge, trying to sign Lee while maintaining enough cap room to land a superstar.The threat of losing Lee will also be greater, with perhaps a dozen teams projected to have major cap space.“Next summer, it changes,” Bartelstein said of the market. “Doing a one-year deal is never something we’ve been afraid of.”As the roster stands now, the Knicks would open camp Sept. 29 with just three new players — the rookies Jordan Hill and Toney Douglas and the veteran Darko Milicic, who was acquired in a June trade.So the summer of 2009 will probably go down as uneventful. But the Knicks’ 2010 dreams remain intact. Ultimately, Walsh said, he will judge his off-season on that basis.“I think,” he said, “that I will feel like I didn’t screw it up for next year.”'"
"'09-09-05,'0','The fact is that most of the work of the federal government’s civil rights enforcement agencies, including the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division, remains the same from administration to administration. On the other hand, there are also important differences: disagreements about the use of racial preferences (a k a affirmative action), whether actual discriminatory intent needs to be shown, whether the focus should be on nondiscrimination and equal opportunity versus racial balancing and equal results.Different administrations will also have different policy priorities — for example, addressing discrimination on the basis of religion versus sexual orientation, or human trafficking versus predatory lending.But the language in your editorial ignores these good-faith differences. Instead, the Bush administration “declared war on the whole idea of civil rights,” appointed a “far-right ideologue” who “screened out job applicants with civil rights sympathies,” “abandoned” civil rights enforcement (the word “abandoned” is used three times), even “aggressively fought on the anti-civil-rights side” on issues like voting rights.

"'09-09-05,'0','WASHINGTON — President Obama announced Friday that he will open up White House visitor logs on a regular basis for the first time in modern history, providing the public an unusually extensive look at who gets the opportunity to help shape American policy at the highest levels.“Americans have a right to know whose voices are being heard in the policymaking process,” the president said in a written statement issued by the White House while he vacationed with his family at Camp David. The new policy settles four lawsuits against the government seeking such records.By the end of the year, the White House will begin posting online every month the names of the people who visited in the last 90 to 120 days. Each person’s full name will be listed, along with the date and time they entered and left and the name of the person they visited. About 70,000 to 100,000 people visit the White House each month, and the records will include tourists as well as people conducting business.The White House outlined several exceptions to the policy: “purely personal guests” of the Obama family; those cases in which the disclosure of visitors’ names “would threaten national security interests”; and those who come for “particularly sensitive meetings,” like candidates for a Supreme Court nomination. Officials said only a “small number” will fit in the latter category, and their names would eventually be disclosed after they are no longer secret, like after a nomination is publicly announced. Moreover, they said, the number of undisclosed visitors will be revealed, to make clear how few they are.Although advocacy groups that push for open government generally hailed the new policy, some said it should also apply to federal agencies and complained that the exceptions were too broad. The White House left itself “a huge loophole,” said Francesca Grifo of the Union of Concerned Scientists. “It can label meetings ‘particularly sensitive,’ and then it does not have to tell us who they’re meeting with.”'"
"'09-09-05,'0','CARACAS, Venezuela — Chevron’s monumental legal battle over oil contamination in Ecuador, which has already dragged on for 16 years, may not be about to conclude anytime soon.Ecuador’s attorney general said Friday that he had requested that the judge in the contamination lawsuit against Chevron recuse himself after Chevron obtained audio and video recordings that appeared to link officials in the party of Ecuador’s president, Rafael Correa, to what Chevron claims was a bribery scheme connected to the case.The judge, Juan Núñez, whose name was mentioned in the recordings as a possible recipient in the bribery scheme, said he had handed the case over to his surrogate judge, Nicolás Zambrano, in the town of Lago Agrio in northern Ecuador. Judge Núñez said he had done nothing improper and described the videos, released by Chevron on Monday, as edited and digitally manipulated.The judge’s recusal is expected to cause delays in reaching a verdict.“It’s like the second shoe dropping,” said Ralph G. Steinhardt, a professor of law and international affairs at the George Washington University Law School, who has followed the case, potentially the world’s largest environmental lawsuit, involving as much as $27 billion in damages. “It’s a stunning turn of events that threatens to perpetuate what is already a very, very long proceeding.”He said the plaintiffs and the defendants deserved fair procedures, “without any appearance of corruption or prejudgment.”'"
"'09-09-05,'0','That it is not a top-tier college by most measures, however, makes Lafayette an excellent test case as it and other private colleges cross the $50,000 annual cost threshold in shaky economic times.Public universities will always appeal on price, and Wellesley and Harvard are likely to remain oversubscribed forever. But Lafayette and colleges like it could have trouble justifying themselves and their cost soon, and the resistance may not simply pass once the economy improves.Tuition costs have gone in only one direction — up — during Mr. Weiss’s career. “I genuinely believe that we are at a crossroads here in higher education,” he said. “I think we have reached a ceiling that we’re beginning to bump into.”Mr. Weiss has not had to make any drastic budget cuts so far. He has frozen many salaries, cut some hours in the student dining halls and scaled back a few building projects.This will seem rather tame to anyone who has lived through even a medium-grade corporate revamping. “We haven’t been good at cutting when we add,” said Robert Massa, Lafayette’s new vice president for communications, speaking of colleges in general. “We just add.”Rising tuition and income from endowments have made this possible. But the unique structure of universities has also made it inconvenient to do otherwise. “In some ways, higher education is more like a political environment than the management of a private corporation,” Mr. Weiss said. Except that thanks to tenure, it is difficult to vote anyone out of office. Still, he added, “Alienating some of your faculty members, if you can avoid it, is something you shouldn’t be doing.”This is just one of the reasons why it is so hard to make big cuts to a college’s budget and reduce tuition in turn. Here are some others:CUTTING DEPARTMENTS The political challenges with faculty make something as seemingly simple and obvious as cutting expensive and undersubscribed academic departments pretty hard. In fact, Mr. Weiss could not remember the last time Lafayette had done such a thing.But such cuts are practically inevitable for programs that have fewer students. “Fine arts has studio-based production, so capital and facility costs are high,” said Jane Wellman, executive director of the nonprofit group Delta Project on Postsecondary Education Costs, Productivity and Accountability, speaking of colleges in general. “Piano tutoring is pretty much one to one in a room with a piano. Pianos are expensive. Agriculture is expensive because of the lab costs, which means a barn.”An English student, however, is generally a profit center. “They’re paying for the chemistry major and the music major and faculty research,” she said. “They don’t want to talk about it in institutions, because the English department gets mad. The little ugly facts about cross-subsidies are inflammatory, so they get papered over.”About all Mr. Weiss will say about this is that he agrees that Lafayette needs to do a better job of discriminating between the things it can and cannot do well. He is too good on the politics to single out any department. But there is little doubt that he and administrators like him will need to give up on some foreign languages, minor sciences or parts of the arts pretty soon.FACULTY PRODUCTIVITY Professors at Lafayette teach five classes a year over two semesters and work with students on their independent research projects. At some colleges and universities, the number of classes is lower and at others it is higher. Couldn’t Lafayette lower costs by demanding that the faculty perform less research and teach one additional class?“The question is what is the quality of that interaction,” Mr. Weiss said. “Our faculty must have the opportunity to revitalize their teaching through research. If you’re teaching the same old course the same old way every year, you’re not keeping up with the discipline and not able to animate your own teaching with that experience.”Not every academic agrees. “Am I, for example, as a tenured professor or any tenured faculty member necessarily, or even probably, a better undergraduate teacher because I am doing research?” asked Burton A. Weisbrod, co-author of “Mission and Money: Understanding the University” and an economics professor at Northwestern. “The answer to that is not clear at all.”Nevertheless, Lafayette is so certain in its convictions that it grants faculty members a year off every six or seven years for a sabbatical. How does a college defend such a practice to parents who have had to work ever harder to pay the growing tuition bill?“What parents should be looking for is the opportunity for their children to have their lives transformed by what happens inside the classroom and out of it,” Mr. Weiss said. And that cannot come, he continued, without access to faculty members who have had the opportunity to recharge their own intellectual reservoirs. “At the end of the day, parents should want their children to have that experience, and we believe that’s the cost of it.”Still, parents are helping to subsidize those sabbaticals. So the optics around this are all wrong in the current economic environment, even if this is one of those things no one can change.ADMINISTRATIVE OVERLOAD Lafayette, like many colleges, spends more on nonfaculty salaries than it does on pay for the teachers. How did that happen? Mr. Weiss uses the evolution of career counseling as an example. He does not recall whether there was a placement office when he was an undergraduate at George Washington University in the 1970s. “Now there is the expectation, and I don’t think it’s misplaced, that students can get help in entering the workplace,” he said. If Lafayette did not create a rigorous support system, he noted, its graduates would be competing with students from other colleges and universities that had done so. “And therefore, we’ve invested very significantly in new administrative staff.”Security is another area where costs have gone up. Just a quick glance at a dormitory bulletin board gives a sense of the breadth of what security departments deal with these days. One posting offered detailed instructions on what to do when encountering a bat, and an eye-opening piece of literature called “Active Shooter Survival Tips.” (Yes, I have linked to it from the online version of this story.)THREE YEARS Perhaps the biggest cost-saving measure for private colleges like Lafayette would be to allow students to pay the same price per year but graduate in three years instead of four. Hartwick College in New York is already trying this; 13 students have signed on this fall.Mr. Weiss said this is worth considering, though he had not looked at how the numbers would work. “Although without sounding in any way defensive, we also do offer time for personal development,” he explained. “And that is part of what college is supposed to be. Not only to learn stuff but to have your life changed. For some students, three years is more than enough, while for others four years is not nearly enough.”He’s right, of course. Or at least that is how college used to be. The question all of us have to ask now is whether the price of that transformative experience is simply too dear — and whether a basic education ought to be the highest (or maybe only) priority.'"
"'09-09-05,'0','Dent, who spent eight months in bed thinking about everything from religion to acquiring a real estate license, finally returned to the tour this year, albeit slowly.In the fifth-set tie breaker Navarro was serving for the match, but Dent hit a perfect backhand lob over Navarro that sat on the baseline. Then Dent appeared to have the match on his strings at 7-6, but he sent an easy forehand volley wide, causing him to scream a wicked invective at his misfortune as the crowd groaned.So the combatants battled on. Dent hit an ace up the middle to take a 10-9 lead and then hit an exquisite backhand return down the line as Navarro charged the net for the last time.Dent squatted down with his racket to his head and screamed a more joyous exclamation, before circling the court, slapping hands with fans and signing autographs for almost everyone who asked.For an encore, Dent will play Andy Murray in a third-round match that will generate a lot of attention.“I honestly don’t know how I’m going to fare against Andy,” Dent said. “But I will guarantee everybody this: If I lose, 6-0, 6-0, 6-0, I’m going to die fighting for every point. My execution isn’t at the level I would like going into a match playing Andy Murray, so I’m going to make up for that with just pure grit and toughness.”In the last event of a long day Rafael Nadal avoided disaster by eliminating Nicolas Kiefer, 6-0, 3-6, 6-3, 6-4, in a match that exposed some of Nadal’s rust after his three-month layoff because of tendinitis in his knees. Until he broke Kiefer’s serve at 4-3 in a 12-minute game in the third set, the outcome was in doubt. But as the match progressed, Nadal gathered strength and confidence and ultimately his talent and athleticism won out.For the first time in the Open era, the top 16 seeded men advanced to the third round in a major.Calm had returned to the proceedings after a day of upsets Thursday. Second-seeded Serena Williams all but stifled a yawn in treating her third-round match against María José Martínez Sánchez of Spain as a minor nuisance in a 6-3, 7-5 victory. No. 10 seed Flavia Pennetta needed 52 minutes to crush Aleksandra Wozniak of Canada, 6-1, 6-1, after Wozniak had routed No. 17 Amélie Mauresmo. And Daniela Hantuchova, No. 22, swatted away Vania King, 6-2, 6-2. King was trying to rekindle another day of undersize American magic a day after the 5-foot-6 Melanie Oudin rocked the Open by ousting the No. 4 seed, Elena Dementieva.When No. 2 men’s seed Andy Murray dropped a set to Paul Capdeville of Chile in their second-round match, it seemed like a big deal, but it turned into little more than a hiccup in his 6-2, 3-6, 6-0, 6-2 victory. Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, the No. 7 men’s seed, kept his momentum going with a dominating 7-5, 6-3, 6-4, victory over Jarkko Nieminen in a triumph of power over a classic counter-puncher. And No. 6 Juan Martín del Potro suffered only a few wobbles in beating Jürgen Melzer of Austria, 7-6 (6), 6-3, 6-3.Venus Williams, seeded third, defeated Magdalena Rybarikova of Slovakia, 6-2, 7-5, to advance to the fourth round. The victory sets up an intriguing matchup: she will take on Kim Clijsters.“So exciting,” Williams said in a television interview. “She’s been playing so great.”Clijsters, who dismissed Kirsten Flipkens, 6-0, 6-2, on Friday, won the Open in 2005. Williams was the last women’s repeat champion, in 2000 and 2001.Williams, wearing bandages above and below her left knee to ease patellar tendinitis in the joint, committed 23 unforced errors in the first nine games of the second set before rallying.Clijsters had little problem defeating Flipkens, whom she has mentored in Belgium.In her previous match, Pennetta had been even more dominant, beating Sania Mirza without dropping a game. The only ripple on the women’s side was a minor upset, No. 8 Victoria Azarenka falling to No. 26 Francesca Schiavone, 4-6, 6-2, 6-2. It wasn’t minor to Azarenka, who smashed her racket at the end of the match.The player no one wants to face is Pennetta, 27, who last month became the first Italian woman to crack the top 10. She won tournaments in Palermo, Italy, and Los Angeles, where she beat Maria Sharapova, to put herself on a roll.'"
"'09-09-05,'0','The task is to balance the often conflicting desires of players (who submit match-time preferences before the tournament), coaches (who often have more than one client and prefer they play at different times), broadcasters (three in the United States and many others around the world, each hoping to increase ratings with well-timed slots for particular players) and ticket-holders (who want compelling tennis for the day and the night sessions).On Thursday, the popular Rafael Nadal was scheduled to play Nicolas Kiefer in Friday’s last match in Ashe Stadium — prime time, at least in this country. Andy Murray of Scotland was placed in the third daytime match at Ashe — an after-dinner treat for fans in Britain.The matchups are cemented according to the bracket, but Curley decides where on the Billie Jean King National Tennis Center’s 18 outdoor courts each of the tournament’s nearly 1,000 matches are played and when. Some start at 11 a.m. Others drift past midnight. By 4 p.m., if all goes well, Curley and his schedule-making crew, including the referee Brian Earley and the assistant referee Keith Crossland, release the order of play for the next day. It arrives rather silently with great expectations.Players learn when they play singles, doubles and mixed-doubles matches — which tells them when to sleep, when to eat, when to practice. Broadcasters can begin promoting matches. Ticket-holders can plan their viewing strategy.“It’s a real Rubik’s Cube; that’s for sure,” Curley said. “It’s very rare when all parties are 100 percent pleased.”Underlying the process are guidelines for fairness. Players, generally scheduled to play singles on alternating days, are supposed to get at least 12 hours of rest between matches; 16 hours is preferable. But weather delays can jam the schedule, and players who also participate in doubles or mixed doubles further limit flexibility.“It makes life much more complicated for us,” Curley said.At noon each day, a meeting is held in the control room, called the Zim Room for the late deputy referee Jim Zimmerman. Representatives from the ATP and WTA Tours, CBS, ESPN, the Tennis Channel and international broadcasters strenuously voice their desires for the next day’s schedule.The group reconvenes and is shown a tentative lineup at 3 p.m.“Hopefully, it will be brief, just to bless the schedule for the following day,” Curley said.Until last year, scheduling was decidedly low-tech. Names stuck on magnetic strips were shifted like chess pieces on large boards on the walls. One of the yellow boards remains as a memento.Everything is done now with a click of the mouse, and the room glows. Many of the flat-screen televisions are hung vertically to better display the information. A primary one lists only “issues” and “conflicts.”To demonstrate, Curley and Crossland moved Friday’s matches around, cutting and pasting from one court to another, from one time to another. A matchup, outlined in blue for men and pink for women, would turn red if the computer recognized a problem.In one case, a player had a doubles match before her singles match — a no-no. In others, the computer flagged too little rest for players. Several noted that coaches had players playing simultaneously.Clicking on a command called “pairs” showed the two matches whose winners meet in the next round. Ideally, the matches take place at the same time, giving each winning player the same amount of rest.That is largely why Kim Clijsters was scheduled to play fourth at Louis Armstrong Stadium on Friday against her fellow Belgian Kirsten Flipkens, a match expected to begin in late afternoon. The winner will play Sunday against the winner of the Venus Williams-Magdalena Rybarikova match, scheduled to begin at 7 p.m. Friday at Ashe Stadium.Curley can handle second-guessing — he acknowledged that the Williams sisters should have played their doubles match on Thursday at Ashe or Armstrong, not the overflowing Grandstand — but aims to avoid complaints about fairness.The process is usually simpler when the brackets hold to form and as the field pares to a more manageable size. Put the top players — Roger Federer, Nadal, Venus and Serena Williams — into the prime spots and fill in the gaps. Follow the rules. Ponder the pleas. Print the schedule. Repeat the next day.But what to do with bracket busters, someone like unseeded Melanie Oudin, the 17-year-old American who defeated No. 4 Elena Dementieva on Thursday at Ashe Stadium and is fast becoming a crowd favorite?Oudin elicited a spirited conversation in the room that afternoon. Concern was raised about the possibility of her playing three doubles matches (one mixed) before her next singles match on Saturday. Could one potential match move from Friday to Saturday, after her singles match, an official asked? It became moot when Oudin and her partner lost in doubles later Thursday.It was nearing 7 p.m. The main part of Friday’s order of play, featuring what were determined to be the top matches scattered on the top five courts, had been released hours ago. Finally, the rest of the schedule — the order of play on all the outlying courts — was released.By then, attention had turned toward Saturday.“As soon as the schedule is out, we start working on the next day,” Curley said. “But you certainly have to wait to see what happens. Does Roddick get through tonight? Does Sharapova get through?”Yes, Andy Roddick and Maria Sharapova won their matches on Thursday night under the lights of Ashe Stadium. They knew whom they would play next, but not when or where. Those decisions are a little more complicated.'"

"'09-09-06,'0','PHOENIX (AP) — A former high-ranking Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent who was stationed in Mexico before retiring in 2007 was arrested Friday on suspicion of conspiracy to smuggle cocaine into the United States.The man, Richard P. Cramer, was arrested at his home in Green Valley, Ariz., about 25 miles south of Tucson, and appeared before a federal judge, who denied bail.No one answered the phone at Mr. Cramer’s home on Friday, and it was unclear if he had a lawyer.The charges stem from a federal investigation by the Drug Enforcement Administration dating to 2006.The authorities say Mr. Cramer helped a large-scale drug trafficking organization move cocaine into the United States, according to a criminal complaint made public Friday.The complaint says Mr. Cramer provided members of a drug smuggling organization with information from confidential law enforcement databases that told them if one of their members was a government informant.'"
"'09-09-06,'0','Mr. Fowler, who is free on bond, will turn 76 on Thursday. He said that legal costs were draining his money.“It’s an anchor on me,” he said. “I can’t go anywhere or do anything.”Mr. Fowler has insisted that he shot Mr. Jackson in self-defense.On Feb. 18, 1965, Mr. Fowler was one of several state troopers patrolling a night march by voting rights advocates in Marion. They were marching to the Perry County Jail to protest the arrest of one of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.’s lieutenants, the Rev. James Orange, for organizing blacks to try to vote.Mr. Fowler has maintained that he fired because Mr. Jackson, who died eight days later, had hit him in the head with a bottle.History has recorded the events differently. Civil rights museums in Alabama and the National Voting Rights Trail credit Mr. Jackson with protecting his mother and grandfather from being beaten by troopers.They say his death prompted organizers to plan a march from Selma to the state capital. State troopers beat those marchers on the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma on “Bloody Sunday.”Michael Jackson, who in 2005 became the first black district attorney for Perry County, reopened the investigation into the death and got a racially diverse grand jury to issue a murder indictment against Mr. Fowler.The presiding circuit judge, Thomas Jones, says in court papers that he has questions about the case because federal and state grand juries reviewed the shooting shortly after it occurred and brought no charges. He ordered the prosecutor to furnish a list of potential trial witnesses and summaries of their expected testimony to the defense.Mr. Jackson appealed to the Alabama Supreme Court, which ruled Friday that disclosing the names would violate Alabama’s rules for criminal cases. He had argued that if the names were revealed before trial, some elderly African-Americans might be reluctant to testify.'"
"'09-09-06,'0','EVERY weekday morning the prison’s not on lockdown, the yard holds its collective breath waiting for the pale-orange package cart to appear through multiple layers of chain-link and razor-wire fences. For most prisoners, this lumbering vessel is their only tangible, physical connection back to the free world. The last couple of years the cart has arrived less often and with visibly lighter loads.We get broadcast television, so the state of the economy outside is no secret. Our families and friends tend to come from the segments of society that are the worst off in the best of times, and worse off still in times like these. Our mothers and fathers, wives and children, those to whom the ties that bind haven’t been unbound by the course of our lives, tell us how hard it is out there.The first inkling of financial difficulties in here surfaced in the chow hall. All of a sudden prison officials became concerned about our overeating. In the last couple of years, our brown plastic trays have started to look and feel a lot emptier. Even the old staples, beans and rice, shrank into bite-sized portions. Luxury items like frosted cake and meat cut from the carcass of a once-living thing vanished. The new menus, chock full of potatoes and meat substitutes, seem right out of a Spartan’s cookbook.Prison is a world reflected in a looking glass, however. The past 25 years were generally prosperous for California; the economy boomed and fortunes were made in the sunny San Fernando Valley. But during this time, the lives of prisoners became much drearier. We were forced into demeaning uniforms, with neon orange letters spelling out “prisoner,” and lost most of the positive programs like conjugal visits and college education that we had had since the ’70s. Money was flowing outside the prison walls, but new “get tough” policies against criminals were causing our population, and our costs, to soar.It is a quirk of California politics that it is among the bluest of states but has some of the reddest of laws. No politician here ever lost an election for being too tough on crime or prisoners. Consequently, all through the ’80s and ’90s billions of dollars were poured into a historic prison-building boom. Private airplane pilots tell me it’s easy to navigate at night from San Diego to Los Angeles and on up the Central Valley to Sacramento by simply following the prisons’ glowing lights. Good times in the free world meant, in here, ever-longer sentences, meaner regulations and ever-decreasing interest in rehabilitation. “Costs be damned; lock ’em up and be done with it” became the unofficial motto of the Department of Corrections.The last time I received a visit from my family, in early July, the air-conditioning in the visiting room had been broken for more than a month. This matters because my prison is in the high desert north of Los Angeles. Temperatures here in the summer commonly rise above 100 dusty, windy degrees. Pack 150 people into an airless room and you’ve got the makings for human meltdown. Two industrial-sized fans only made a hot situation noisy, too.'"
"'09-09-06,'0','“These guys, they’re like my brothers,” said Monfils, seeded 13th at the Open. “We’re all extremely close. It’s tough to describe what it is because we’ve just always known each other. It’s always been the way.”Until the last few years, the French tennis scene had been distinctly devoid of stars. Sébastien Grosjean rose to No. 4 in the world and was a mainstay at Grand Slam events for the last decade, and Arnaud Clément peaked with an Australian Open final appearance in 2001.But Tsonga and Monfils led the charge for French tennis’s strikingly quick youth movement. Monfils was the first of the four to break into the top 50 and qualified for the semifinals of the French Open last year. In January, Tsonga went one better, reaching the Australian Open final.More than delivering results, they are doing it with entertaining tennis.“Gaël and Jo have some serious charisma,” Ouanna said. “It’s a nice change. It’s like when Noah was playing and everyone knew his face.”Monfils, with his teased hair, gregarious personality and captivating athleticism, is the consummate showman. At Roland Garros, he whipped up the crowd with a dance routine inspired by the rapper Soulja Boy. Off the court, he decorates his sneakers with rhinestones and gold marker, always signing them with his nickname, La Monf.And after knocking off Andreas Beck in the Open’s second round on Friday, he paid homage to his hero Muhammad Ali by throwing four quick jabs at the baseline and finishing with an uppercut.Then he paid homage to himself by tracing the bulge of his exposed biceps with his racket.“I’m just being natural, being me,” Monfils said. “I love being in front of a crowd when it’s buzzing.”Tsonga puts on a different kind of show — and he never dances. With sheer power and a rugby player’s build, the 6-foot-2, 200-pound Tsonga brutalizes opponents, always wearing his emotions on his sleeve. He swaggers, he yells on the court, and with a wave of the arms, he turns up the volume wherever he plays.“I actually like to kid around and laugh, and on the court I do like to put on a show,” said Tsonga, the seventh seed. “But I don’t have that actor side like Gaël.”Simon, seeded ninth, is more reserved on the court and mutters to himself. Ouanna seems downright shy.But even with their wide range of personalities, the four grew up as one another’s support network. In France, young athletes are selected early to leave home for what is known as a Sport Études programs, meant to develop elite athletes in all sports. So after long days split between the classroom and the practice courts, Monfils, Tsonga, Simon and Ouanna counted on one another to preserve some modicum of balance in their lives.“We could hang out with each other like human beings, normal people who don’t play tennis all day,” Tsonga said.Even so, Simon said, little was normal about the situation.“We did whatever we could to make it as fun as possible, and none of us regrets our choices,” he said. “But in no way was it what teenagers are used to experiencing.”For years, the four pushed each other to be better, without a trace of jealousy. Even as coaches who made careers dealing in broken dreams constantly reminded them that perhaps only one would make it to the big time, they kept driving forward, each at his own pace.“We all stayed tight growing up, and I think that as each of us got better, we pulled the others,” Tsonga said. “Subconsciously, it was always about keeping up when one of us was playing well.”Now on the professional tour, where each player travels with coaches, trainers, agents and hangers-on, they still stumble through the crowds of the Open to keep an eye on each other.“If the top 100 could be entirely made up of my buddies,” Simon said, “it would be a lot more fun.”'"
"'09-09-06,'0','LOST IN THE CROWD The problem of short attention spans has a first cousin: the overcrowded legislative agenda, which has spread the resources and time of Congress and the administration thinly over a vast array of issues.There is a budget to pass, health insurance to reform, energy to cap and trade, schools to overhaul, two wars to watch over and others to avoid — and more. Amid all of this, the Treasury has sent Congress 16 pieces of financial reform legislation, totaling 618 pages. What are the chances that these 16 bills will surface to the top of the legislative agenda?THE MOTHER OF ALL LOBBIES Almost everything becomes lobbied to death in Washington. In the case of financial reform, the money at stake is mind-boggling, and one financial industry after another will go to the mat to fight any provision that might hurt it.But your exercise instructor had it right: no pain, no gain. If we don’t inflict a modicum of pain on financial players — not out of spite, but because the system needs change — we will accomplish little.BUREAUCRATIC INFIGHTING Industry lobbyists are not the only problem. Regulatory deck chairs need to be rearranged, and various government agencies are scrambling to maintain or expand their turfs.So, for example, other regulators don’t want to lose influence to the Federal Reserve, and the Fed doesn’t want to give up its consumer protection functions — two changes that Treasury proposes. The bureaucratic turf wars have grown intense, with Timothy F. Geithner, the Treasury secretary, reportedly berating regulators at a meeting last month.A LACK OF FOCUS Perhaps worst of all, it’s hard to keep the public engaged in something as complex, arcane and — frankly — as boring as financial regulation.We have a heavily checked-and-balanced political system. To get anything done, one must overcome both a strong status-quo bias and powerful lobbying. Normally, that requires constituents to pressure their elected representatives — hard.Today, the electorate has a vague sense that it has been ripped off and that change is needed. But the sentiment is unfocused and inchoate — with these two exceptions: People clearly want greater consumer protection and restrictions on executive pay.By no coincidence, those are the two pieces of financial reform that seem most likely to survive the Congressional sausage grinder. Don’t get me wrong; we need both. But the two don’t constitute the entirety of reform, or even its most important parts.I’d attach greater importance to at least three major Treasury proposals that may wind up on the cutting-room floor:First, we need a systemic risk monitor or regulator. A monitor just watches risks develop and issues warnings, while a regulator is empowered to take action. In my last column, I explained the reasons for wanting a systemic risk regulator, and why the Fed should get the job.Second, we need a new mechanism to euthanize or rehabilitate giant financial institutions whose failure could threaten the whole system. Lehman was put into Chapter 11, with catastrophic effects. A.I.G. was turned into an appallingly expensive ward of the state. There must be no more situations like these. As both Mr. Geithner and Ben S. Bernanke, the Fed chairman, have observed, we need a better way out.Third, something serious must be done to tame — though not to destroy — the derivatives markets. Today, virtually all derivatives trading remains unregulated and nontransparent. Much of it also has too little capital and, at crucial times, too little collateral behind it. The Treasury’s draft legislation proposes to fix these problems by standardizing many derivatives and pushing trading into clearinghouses or organized exchanges, where more capital would be required and collateral would have to be posted often.And there is a great deal more in those 618 pages.So let’s get on with the job, remembering the Emanuel Principle. There will never be a better time “to do important things” for our financial system.'"
"'09-09-06,'0','Boeing acknowledges that the problems have sorely tested the patience of suppliers and customers, and damaged its credibility. Already, 60 orders have been canceled, partly because of the delay.The company’s chief, W. James McNerney Jr., concedes that Boeing lost control of the process by farming out more design and production work than ever and not keeping close tabs on suppliers. He says the company is retaking control.“You ultimately get to the question: Is it worth it?” Mr. McNerney says. “And my answer is yes. And that is why you take the risks. But could we have done it smarter? Yes.”Even after the cancellations, the Dreamliner has more advance orders from airlines — about 850 — than any other commercial plane in history. Part of what gives Boeing an edge is that its main rival, Airbus, does not expect to complete its first composite plane until 2013.At an average sales price that aviation analysts believe to be about $125 million each, those 850 Dreamliners could turn into $110 billion.The appeal to the airlines is clear: With half of its structure made of plastics reinforced with carbon fiber, a composite that is both lighter and stronger than aluminum, and more efficient engines, the 787 could cut fuel costs by up to 20 percent, Boeing says. That could enable it to fly greater distances, opening more routes for point-to-point service and lessening the need for passengers to change planes at hubs.Boeing, which is based in Chicago, said recently that it was fixing the latest Dreamliner snag: a series of unexpected stresses where the wings join the fuselage. It says it expects to begin test flights this year and to start delivering the plane in the last quarter of 2010.In many ways, Boeing’s troubles could not have come at a worse time, with the recession curtailing orders for planes (making the 787 delays a relief to some airlines that do not have the cash now).And Boeing’s large military business, which helped buffer the company from a similar collapse in aviation after the terrorist attacks in 2001, has been hit hard by cuts in Pentagon spending on big weapons systems.Given the problems, the company is taking steps to conserve cash. It had about $5 billion on hand at the end of June, down from $7 billion at the end of 2007. It is also going through a management shuffle, with the announcement last week that James F. Albaugh, the longtime head of its military business, was taking over the commercial side.And aviation analysts have begun to sound more skeptical about Mr. McNerney, 60, a former chief of 3M who won praise for cleaning up ethical scandals after he came to Boeing in 2005.“There’s a real feeling now that things are happening on his watch that aren’t so great,” said Richard Aboulafia, an aviation analyst at the Teal Group in Fairfax, Va. “I think this is his test.”Others are asking a broader question: whether Boeing will be able to regain its old magic at driving projects home.“It’s very clear that this company excels in dreaming big, so big at times they’ve even taken their competitors’ breath away,” said Heidi Wood, an analyst at Morgan Stanley. “But there has been something of a pattern lately where those big dreams have been harder to realize.”AT the time the Dreamliner was being planned, in 2003 and 2004, Boeing’s commercial aviation business was still suffering from the fallout of the Sept. 11 attacks. Boeing was also losing market share to Airbus, the European consortium that was winning the battle to sell midsize wide-body planes with its A-330 series.Boeing knew that it needed to make the next technological leap if it was going to get back ahead of Airbus. And most aviation experts still think that the Dreamliner, set to replace the aging 767, could be a game-changer.But after Boeing merged with McDonnell-Douglas in 1997, its top executives became more cautious about investing in new airplane projects. Boeing’s goal in the merger was to broaden its military business and give it a more reliable revenue stream to help offset the boom-and-bust cycles in commercial aviation.With the Dreamliner, Boeing aimed to expand its longtime outsourcing efforts, which had mainly focused on manufacturing parts, to a risk-sharing program in which the suppliers would also be Boeing’s partners.“The idea was to get the risk off their books and get other people to do the heavy lifting for them,” Mr. Aboulafia said. “But the flaw was that led to a kind of ‘engineering light’ approach, and the problems on the 787 can be traced to that.”For instance, Boeing contracted out the design and construction of the wings — one of the most exacting parts of the aircraft — for the first time ever. It also let other companies wrestle with the complicated task of baking and shaping the plastic composites.And instead of being paid when they shipped parts, the partners agreed to wait and recover their capital — and receive a share of the profits — once Boeing delivered the planes to the airlines.But Boeing officials now say that this left the whole process vulnerable, should any part of the chain face delays. Start-up problems and shortages of simple parts like nuts and bolts, along with a labor strike at Boeing last year, all caused delays and created a domino effect that intensified the pressure on the most poorly capitalized suppliers.“I think there were places where we went too far,” said Scott Carson, who led the commercial division. He plans to retire at year-end and was replaced in the division post on Tuesday by Mr. Albaugh. “Clearly, we made some poor judgment calls in terms of what people’s capabilities were.”Mr. McNerney has good relationships with several airline executives from his stint as head of the aircraft engine business at General Electric. As the Dreamliner problems mounted, he said, he called to ask them to be patient and to make new deals where needed.He visited the largest suppliers — including Vought Aircraft Industries in North Charleston, S.C.; Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Fuji Heavy Industries and Kawasaki Heavy Industries in Japan; and Alenia Aeronautica in Italy — to get a better handle on the problems.He also visited Spirit AeroSystems of Wichita, Kan., which makes the front section of the fuselage at an old Boeing plant. Spirit cut costs by negotiating lower labor contracts than Boeing had, and Boeing cites it as one of the best examples of how it intended outsourcing to work.Stock analysts estimate that the company initially planned to invest $8 billion to $10 billion in developing the project, but could end up spending $20 billion, including the penalties it will owe for delivery delays.STILL, by last spring, things seemed to be coming together, as the first plane was passing some of its ground tests. But in late May, the latest crisis began when there were signs of stress during a wing-bending test.Patrick M. Shanahan, the vice president in charge of airplane programs at the commercial aviation unit, said the readings were totally unexpected but not initially worrisome. He said his technical team had been making bets about what type of last-minute problems might pop up to prevent one of the planes from making the first test flight by June 30. No one thought that the plane’s structure, which had always exceeded testing expectations, “was going to bite us,” he says.But additional tests in mid-June showed that the plane’s structure needed reinforcements, and the test flight had to be canceled. The problem placed more strain on the suppliers, particularly Vought Aircraft Industries, which ran a plant in South Carolina that builds the rear fuselage section.In 2008, Boeing had already bought out Vought’s interest in a nearby facility that had become a production bottleneck. Boeing also advanced $422 million to the company to help it meet production demands. But Vought’s chief executive, Elmer L. Doty, said he could not keep raising money to see the program through. So in early July, Boeing bought the rear-fuselage plant from Vought.Scott Hamilton, managing director of the Leeham Company, an aviation consulting firm, says some of Boeing’s other suppliers are angry about the delivery delays and are insisting that Boeing pay them an advance against some of their expected profits. Mr. McNerney said that Boeing would provide cash to some of them.Boeing’s purchase of Vought’s operations was crucial in redrawing the lines of its partnership model and taking some of the most essential work back, Mr. McNerney said. He says its other top partners are all making solid progress in ramping up production. And while Boeing still believes in its model of teaming up with partners that share in the risks, it intends to retain a greater share of the engineering on future projects and monitor its partners’ work much more closely, he said.MR. McNERNEY says Boeing has the size and resources to handle the difficulties on the project.Even though Pentagon spending is turning down, the company still expects its military revenue to stay flat over the next couple of years, at around $32 billion a year. And though the recession is hurting, Boeing still expects to deliver about 480 planes this year and has a total backlog of 3,400 additional orders.Boeing has forecast total revenue of $68 billion for 2009, up from $60.9 billion in 2008. (Machinists went on strike that year, and Boeing’s profit fell 34 percent from the year before, to $2.7 billion.)On Aug. 27, when it announced the new flight test and delivery schedule for the Dreamliner, Boeing also said it would take a $2.5 billion charge, or $2.21 a share, in the third quarter to write off the cost of the research and development work on the first three Dreamliners. It is also cutting 10,000 jobs this year, or 6 percent of its work force. Its stock, which peaked at $104.99 a share in 2007 when the Dreamliner orders were pouring in, closed Friday at $49.15.Aviation experts caution that the 787 project could still falter if new problems arise in the flight tests and other certification checks.But Mr. McNerney says the company’s Dreamliner bet will still pay off handsomely, especially if it can stay ahead of Airbus in using the composite technology to update other models.“We got the plane right,” he said. “And the good news is that when we get all this done, we’re going to be far ahead of our competition.”'"

"'09-09-06,'0','THE Berndt Toast Gang, a group of Long Island cartoonists who meet once a month for lunch to hobnob and talk about their craft, have a suggestion to comfort those who see nothing but gloom and doom on the nation’s horizon: Yuk it up.“When you read the news these days, it’s such a downer,” said Mort Drucker, a longtime member and renowned cartoonist who has been cheering up the world, primarily in Mad magazine, for the past 53 years. “Cartoons give you a chance to laugh a little.”Everyone will have a chance for some irreverent chuckles at “Laugh Lines,” an exhibition of the gang’s work from Sept. 16 through Nov. 30 at the Art-trium Gallery on Melville Park Road in Melville. The exhibit, sponsored by the Huntington Arts Council, is an homage to the artists who have helped us through hard times, including wars and national tragedies, said William Grabowski, the curator who came up with the idea.“A cartoon is sort of like a stimulus package for all of us,” Mr. Grabowski said.Fans of comics will have a chance to see work by about 30 of the group’s members, including Mr. Drucker and the artists or creators associated with legendary strips like “Archie,” “The Phantom,” “Felix the Cat,” “The Lockhorns” and “Mary Worth.” Other contributors have done work for outlets like the Walt Disney Company and The New Yorker magazine.Officially, the Berndt Toast Gang is a chapter of the National Cartoonists Society, which has members involved in a variety of media, including comic books and advertising. The Long Island branch was born in 1966 when an initial core group — working on a project for the Hanna-Barbera animation studio — began meeting regularly. The nickname stuck when glasses were raised to a deceased member, Walter Berndt, who created the comic strip “Smitty.”Even cartoonists can use a few laughs in times like these, when print outlets are declining, said Adrian C. Sinnott, 53, a children’s book illustrator and the chapter chairman.'"
"'09-09-06,'0','Monmouth County is suing the agency in federal court to block the flood-zone designations. The lawsuit contends that the agency declared a two-mile 1970s-era dike along Pews Creek and the dunes along Raritan Bay to be adequate flood protection for bayside residents as recently as January 2008 — then, five months later, switched positions.At the same time, Assemblywoman Amy H. Handlin has called on the Army Corps of Engineers to spend $25 million in stimulus money to rebuild the 15-foot-tall dike so that residents behind it do not have to buy insurance.“If FEMA believes its own rhetoric, then we have thousands of homeowners who are in danger of losing their properties and, potentially, their lives,” she said in an interview.Behind the debate lies the complex half-century-old saga of flood insurance. Because floods can wreak wide and catastrophic destruction, few carriers provided insurance until 1968, when Congress created the National Flood Insurance Program. Under the program, homeowners in certain zones are required to buy policies from insurance companies — about 90 provide it — and the government pays for flood damage with federal funds collected largely from homeowner premiums.To enable homeowners to know their risks, FEMA was charged with mapping areas with a 1 percent or more chance of catastrophic flooding in any given year. Banks almost always require customers in these zones to purchase flood insurance to get or maintain their mortgages.The federal agency said the accuracy of the previous maps, which were 20 and 30 years old, had been overtaken by changes in terrain and by the construction of roads and housing developments, which affect the ability of land to absorb water, and alter water runoff patterns. (FEMA officials said global warming was not a factor.)FEMA used several strategies for its remappings. In some regions, aerial surveyors in planes equipped with laser and radar measured elevation. In other zones, like New York City and Westchester County, the agency adopted maps recently drawn by local ground surveyors.For property owners, the picture has been mixed. In Nassau County, where maps become effective Friday, there are about 14,000 more structures on the flood-prone list than before the revisions. But in Suffolk County, there are about 4,000 fewer.Among other misgivings over the flood maps, Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York said the maps in the town of Gates, west of Rochester, were flawed. Barbara Lynch, a spokeswoman for the agency, acknowledged, “Maps were not done well in Gates,” and the town’s engineers were able to get many homes removed from the flood-prone list.Residents can view the agency’s maps online, or visit their local town halls to check whether their properties are deemed flood-prone. Property owners who object to the agency’s classification of their buildings can commission land surveys (at a cost of several hundred dollars) and then ask FEMA for a “letter of map amendment” to show to their banks. The agency is also encouraging newly designated homeowners to sign up for insurance before its maps become effective so they can be grandfathered under cheaper rates available to those who do not live in official flood zones.Deep skepticism lingers in shoreline communities like North Middletown and Keansburg, N.J., where the owners of many schools, churches and nursing homes, as well as houses, would have to buy insurance. Anthony P. Mercantante, the Middletown administrator, pointed out that the levee prevented flooding even during a memorable northeaster in 1992. Besides, he said, Raritan Bay does not produce the speedy waves that cause the worst destruction.Bruce Steneck, 68, a retired power lineman from nearby Hazlet who has lived on the Jersey Shore his entire life, said that the worst storm he could remember was in the 1960s, and that bay water moved only a couple of blocks inland. He lives 11 blocks away, yet is in the new flood zone.“A tsunami would have to hit Raritan Bay to push the water as far as Highway 36, and that, in my opinion, would never happen,” he said, referring to the major road that runs parallel to the shoreline. “They are forcing a lot of people to take flood insurance that it would never affect.”Mary Flynn, 36, a biochemist, said she was not required to buy flood insurance when she purchased her two-story colonial about a block and a half from the bay in 2004. She worries that the new map, putting her in the flood zone, could affect her ability to sell.Nevertheless, aware that insurance will cost her $800 now and $2,000 after Sept. 25, Ms. Flynn said she planned to buy it right away.'"
"'09-09-06,'0','Although our awareness of the voyages of Henry Hudson, Robert Fulton and Samuel Champlain may have vastly increased over the past year — courtesy of exhibitions, performances and publications celebrating 400 years of European settlement in the Hudson River Valley — most of us are still fairly ignorant when it comes to the native people who once inhabited the region.Hence the importance of “The Muhheakantuck in Focus,” a new exhibition at Wave Hill in the Bronx that looks at the significance of the Hudson to indigenous people before and after the arrival of European settlers. Arranged by Jennifer McGregor, the curator at Wave Hill, it is a thoughtful, informative and entertaining show, bringing together about a dozen artists from Mexico, the United States and Canada, several of them American Indians.The exhibition uses the Lenape word for the Hudson, “the river that flows both ways.” At the time of European settlement in the 16th and 17th centuries, the Lenape occupied an area encompassing what is today New Jersey, southern New York, eastern Pennsylvania, and parts of Delaware.The bulk of the show is installed in the Glyndor Gallery, housed in an old mansion, with a handful of additional pieces around the grounds. I like this incorporation of the outdoor area, for one of the real joys of a visit to Wave Hill at this time of year is a stroll in the gardens, which become even more rewarding when you are wandering around looking for art.Outdoors, visitors will discover that some of the works are hammocks installed in shady woods, conceived by Laura Anderson Barbata to offer an open-ended experience with nature, and a series of aluminum signs by Edgar Heap of Birds that juxtapose words relating to the ancient and modern uses of the river. The signs are more stimulating than the hammocks; in fact, it’s easy to fall asleep in the hammocks.Mr. Heap of Birds is one of America’s most famous Indian artists and a good inclusion in the show, for much of his art has revolved around recovering forgotten or invisible histories of place. His signs at Wave Hill remind us of a vanished indigenous past, but also that the Hudson River is an ecosystem that requires constant stewardship and care.'"
"'09-09-06,'0','Lately, some oddities that have attracted attention include heartland vignettes (“Police Fun at Davidsfarm”); security-cam film of debatable authenticity (“Understanding Automatic Door FAIL”); stunts (“Guy Catches Laptop With His Butt”); accidents (“Horse Hit by Car”); and animation with Legos (“8-Bit Trip”).Of course, YouTube does show many, many clips from actual television, with and without the permission of the networks. Popular ones include “Snoop Dogg on ‘Who Wants to Be a Millionaire’ ” and “Seth Rogen Talks About Being Rejected by Megan Fox,” from “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” There are also copyrighted, professionally produced music videos uploaded by outfits like and Universal.But what’s surprising is how little the homemade videos resemble the pro goods. Sure, there are parodies of mainstream clips here and there, but mostly the amateurs are off on their own, hatching new genres. Consider “haul” videos, in which people show off the stuff they recently bought, or the popular “fail” videos, which show all manner of efforts gone wrong. Individual haul and fail videos often attract 100,000 views or more — and no one had even imagined such genres until recently. At the same time, no one at any production company seems to be struggling to serve the haul-fail audiences (or combine them?). And the haul people and fail people evidently don’t feel underserved: they are helping themselves and creating what can only be called an scene, all around the many, many videos of their genre on YouTube.In serving these niche audiences with their microgenres, YouTube has solidified its slot as a home for the vernacular avant-garde. For years, I have believed this, and for years people have warned (or promised) me that any day now the heterogeneous site would be steamrolled by commercial forces that would wipe out the indigenous flora and fauna. But not only has the weird, small stuff hung around — out of sight of the home page, in many cases — but it also continues to be found by its audience. YouTube may not be making money as efficiently as Google once hoped it would, but it’s still incubating novel forms of creative expression and cultivating new audiences.This hit me recently when a YouTube video called “Manhattan Bridge Piers” made the rounds on TV and blogs. A beautifully shot, silent time-lapse documentary, it showed the Manhattan Bridge dramatically wobbling when the subway crosses, as if on the verge of collapse. Commenters came at the video from a range of angles. “Amazing video!” one wrote. “Fat New Yorkers!” snapped another. “It’s designed to be flexible. No structure of that size can be made completely rigid,” wrote a third, whose assessment was borne out by professional engineers who commented elsewhere.In fact, though “Manhattan Bridge Piers” was played on TV for shock value, the video — which was uploaded by a YouTube member named kvertrees, whose work includes other silent films, of mushrooms and swallows — works better as a tribute to suspension technology. And it works best as an art film.It recalls nothing so much as “Manhatta,” another silent documentary — from 1921 — by the painter Charles Sheeler and the photographer Paul Strand. With title cards that give quotations from , “Manhatta” turns the urban landscape into a series of painterly, often abstract vistas. Art museums now show it alongside the still photography and painting of Modernist masters. As in “Manhattan Bridge Piers,” the city seems ominous in “Manhatta,” if only because it so completely overshadows the humans in it.No wonder some viewers envisioned literal collapse after seeing kvertrees’s film. In “Manhatta,” which emphasizes how the city dwarfs and threatens its inhabitants, a crowd of commuters disembarks from the ; they’re jammed so tightly that they seem in danger of suffocating or stampeding. Similarly, there’s virtually no way to see the city in “Manhattan Bridge Piers” except as one secured by fragile pacts.In both films, the filmmakers align their technology with soaring modern structures and have sought vantages from which to underscore that identification. But the humans in the two movies are mostly out of sight, encased in monstrously beautiful that can be truly beheld — in all its , soaring, swaying, flashing sublimity — only by gods or cameras.None of kvertrees’s other videos, each powerful in its own way, has received the attention that “Manhattan Bridge Piers” did, largely because news outlets couldn’t peg a discussion of infrastructure disintegration to them. But the others, the mushrooms and the swallows, are worth watching, too. As casual users have puzzled over YouTube — its mayhem and trivia, its commercial and political uses — hard-core users have quietly figured it out. It’s a place for art.CAHIERS DU YOUTUBE He even looks a little like . Behold: Jawed Karim in that masterpiece of short film,“Me at the Zoo.” Someone should write a dissertation on it.

"'09-09-06,'0','For the next three months Ms. Beglarian, who has run a marathon and built a cabin in Vermont, will continue to glide the Mississippi’s 2,300 or so miles, from Lake Itasca in Minnesota to the Gulf of Mexico. Along the way she is collecting snippets of sound, image and history from both her perch on the river and excursions into nearby towns, in wilderness and urban sprawl.In late November, barring hurricanes and unfortunate barge encounters, she will arrive at the Mississippi’s end. The next fall, after months of composing, Ms. Beglarian plans to head back upstream — by car; she’s not crazy — with a small ensemble and perform new works for and with residents of the communities that inspired them.But somewhat to her surprise, what began as a solitary sojourn has morphed into a kind of floating artists’ colony and mutual collaboration society, gathering members for days or weeks at a time.“When I decided I needed to do this, I originally was going to do this alone,” Ms. Beglarian said. Soon loneliness became an overriding concern; she hadn’t set out to recreate Thoreau’s “Walden.”Seeking company, Ms. Beglarian sent an e-mail message to her mailing list and Facebook friends, saying: “I’m doing this. If you want to come, come.”They came. Her first traveling companions were Mac Walton, a trombonist and musicologist she had met two years earlier while he was studying at Williams College, and Richard Steadman-Jones, a linguist and historian at the University of Sheffield in England with whom she has embarked on a project about displacement and language among the Ojibwa tribe in Minnesota and early European settlers.The guest list continues to grow. Last week Heather Hitchens, the executive director of the New York State Council on the Arts, tagged along. Caroline Walker, an Illinois poet interested in the river’s military history; Cori Ellison, the dramaturge of the New York City Opera; and Mary Rowell, a violinist in the string quartet Ethel, have signed on. Although each will affect Ms. Beglarian’s work, and she theirs, no one is sure about the results.Ms. Ellison, who envisions creating something of a musical dramatic nature, said: “I think Eve has begun this journey with a complete tabula rasa. She’ll just use the chemical reaction of who’s there.”For armchair travelers, and as another layer of her artistic endeavor, Ms. Beglarian started a blog (evbvd.com/riverblog), which she fills with photographs and writings about whatever strikes her fancy during the 20 or so miles she tallies each day. It also lists books she is reading (Michael D. McNally’s “Ojibwe Singers: Hymns, Grief and a Native American Culture in Motion”) and music she is listening to (Delta blues, Bob Dylan’s “Mississippi” and the Talking Heads and the B. B. King-Al Green versions of “Take Me to the River”), as well as music she wrote before her trip (“The Flood,” her setting of the Robert Frost poem in response to the great Mississippi flood of 1927).Still, her soundtrack on the river is mostly silence. “When I’m kayaking, I definitely don’t have my iPod on,” she said. She hears mostly the rhythmic slice of oar through current, the scraping of vessel across reeds bent in submission to the water’s downward flow.Occasionally she records sounds to add to her extensive electronic database. Her current fixation is pumps, the kind found near dams and locks. On days when her traveling companions are taking their turns in the kayak, she gets into her car to scout out that night’s campsite at a reasonable distance downstream and explore communities along the water’s edge, with a visit to a different church each Sunday. When it’s her turn to paddle, a fellow traveler climbs into the driver’s seat; if she has two or more guests, someone generally boards the bicycle she has brought along and pedals to the next stop. By the time the Mississippi turns into a sort of superhighway below Cairo, Mo., with industrial vessels navigating a swift current, Ms. Beglarian said, she expects to bike more and kayak less.On her off days and evenings she plugs in her computer and keyboard at her campsite or a public library. After a month of paddling she is finally feeling the desire to compose, though not yet with a sense of urgency.“Probably the most significant thing here,” Ms. Hitchens, the arts council executive, wrote in an e-mail message, “is the opportunity for so many people, whether it be friends like me who are throwing caution to the wind to join her for a few days or the random people she meets along the way, to be somehow involved in her creative process. This is important for her, but also for each one of us. As she has said to me a number of times, all the various people who participate will help color the experience and ultimately the work. There are not many works that get created this way, and I would venture to say that she is breaking some new ground here.”As Ms. Beglarian travels along what she called “this secret path through the country,” she is content to keep an ear to the Mississippi and go with the flow.“On this trip, it’s my turn,” she said. “It’s clear the subject is the river. But what that means, and how it takes shape, is something that the river is going to tell me.”'"

"'09-09-07,'0','But these critics are fighting a rising tide. According to AmeriCorps officials, applications have nearly tripled in the last year. From November 2007 to August 2008, the agency received 67,283 online applications; from November 2008 to last month, it received 200,682.The increase has been so great that AmeriCorps has a prepared statement divining the reasons: the recession, of course; something called the “Obama effect”; and what it describes as a “strong altruistic streak among today’s young adults.”Agency officials say that many young people have used the catastrophes of Sept. 11 and Hurricane Katrina as calls to action. Social networks like Facebook have simplified organizing around a particular cause. And high schools and colleges are frequently incorporating community service into the curriculum.In describing why they had joined AmeriCorps, these young people clearing a forest trail in work pants, not lederhosen, do not refer to Mr. Obama, or Hurricane Katrina, or the Kennedys. But the reasons they give echo Mr. Kennedy, with a postmillennial flavor. As one of them, Travis Sackett, 24, put it: “I’m all about community service.”His means of service comes through the National Civilian Community Corps, an AmeriCorps residential program for people 18 to 24 years old that specializes in disaster response but also in conservation efforts like their trail work here. It is partly modeled after the long-gone Civilian Conservation Corps, the New Deal initiative that trained millions of the unemployed to preserve the nation’s national resources, fighting fires, planting trees and building campgrounds.Several months ago, Mr. Sackett and his colleagues mustered with 150 other young people on the sprawling grounds of the V.A. Medical Center in Perry Point, Md., where the corps operates one of its regional campuses. The young people — each of whom costs the government about $22,200 — were divided into teams and assigned to run-down houses from World War I that stand a few dozen yards from the Chesapeake Bay.Roughly one-third of those enlisted have four-year college degrees, one-third have some college experience, and one-third have completed only high school. Their ranks are overwhelmingly white — a concern that the corps says it is addressing by intensifying recruitment efforts in the cities its teams work in.The recruits were instructed to keep in shape and to work and live in teams of about a dozen. They were advised to pool their $4.50-a-day meal allowances for groceries, to eat family style, and to work out any interpersonal problems, because there is not a lot of “personal space” in the corps.Once training was completed, the recruits stuffed their N.C.C.C.-issue red duffel bags with N.C.C.C.-issue shirts and pants and steel-tipped boots, and waited to be dispatched to somewhere in America, to help.Take wiry Alex Green, now dragging away another downed branch. Growing up in Topeka, Kan., he says, he dabbled in drugs and alcohol and had enough run-ins with the law that “I saw community service as punishment.”Thanks to a nudge, or a shove, from his mother — she basically signed him up behind his back, he says — Mr. Green joined the corps a year out of high school and straightened out his life. He built houses in Waveland and Gulfport, Miss., worked on a children’s garden in Camden, N.J., and cleaned up after flooding in Hanover, W.Va. Now 20, he is the leader of this elite team of certified firefighters and trained sawyers.He hopes to join another AmeriCorps program, because he likes the outdoors and helping people. “Mother knows best,” he says of his changed life.The crew breaks before noon for the lunch bought with their pooled $4.50 a day. They sit in the bed of a pickup, or on the hot ground, wood chips and leaves flecking their damp arms. They eat leftovers in Tupperware, some nuts, some fruit. The smell of chain saw fuel hangs in the air.Here is Laura Dierbeck, 23, from Milwaukee, a college graduate who a year ago was a clerk at a Blockbuster store, and hating it. So far this year, she has worked at a boys-and-girls club in Brunswick, Ga. (where she slept at night on the pool table), and demolished and built houses along the Gulf Coast. She also learned to operate a chain saw, a tool she had never held before.“I wanted to say I’m a girl and I can do it,” the small woman says.And here is Mr. Sackett, the one who is all about community service. Tall, with long brown hair flowing from under his construction helmet, he is from the upstate New York town of Batavia. He enlisted in the corps shortly after earning a college degree in business administration, and so far he has ripped out ruined sheetrock in flood-damaged parts of West Virginia, put up no-dumping signs above sewer drains in Gainesville, Fla., and been surprised by how much he enjoyed volunteering at a New Orleans soup kitchen.They all seem aware of how goofy it may sound to say, simply, that they want to help their country. But they say it anyway. Ms. Stone, a graphic designer who discovered that she did not like spending her days in front of a computer (“Funny how that works,” she says), returned from an eight-week tour on the Gulf Coast and promptly got a tattoo.That tattoo is legible on her right arm now as she sits on the ground, eating. “Be Selfless,” it says. “Stay True.”Lunch ends, and nine young Americans go back to work.'"

"'09-09-07,'0','“The beauty of the iPhone is that there are a lot of applications that Apple would not have imagined people want,” said Sree Kotay, chief software architect for Comcast. “We want people engaged with television in ways we haven’t thought of yet.”The apps idea goes beyond interactive television.For years, many cable and satellite customers have been able to get news articles, weather forecasts and sports scores through their set-top boxes. Some boxes also insert on-screen messages during some commercials, urging viewers to use their remote to get more information on screen.But very little of this interactivity actually engaged customers, leading many in the industry to conclude that all most people want to do with their TVs is watch.With people getting used to sophisticated electronic interactions, not just on computer screens but on devices used all day — car dashboards, cameras and especially cellphones — the industry is rethinking that theory.While viewers remain passive most of the time, they increasingly want the capabilities and information they come to depend on from one gadget with a screen to be available to them on all the other screens they use every day.On FiOS, the Facebook application lets people see photos on their television screens that have been shared by their friends. The Twitter application shows a running stream of tweets about the show being viewed on the left side of the screen.“The shows become a lot more fun to watch because there is a whole conversation going on,” said Shadman Zafar, Verizon’s senior vice president for product development. “For sports, it’s like bringing the rest of the sports bar into your home.”The Twitter service has been a hit, with more than a million FiOS customers using it within the first three days. But Mr. Zafar mistakenly believed that people wanted to read tweets on the TV and use their computers to send them.“We didn’t allow people to send tweets from their remotes,” he said. “We thought you mostly lean back and want to see what other people say. In four hours after the product went live, we had hundreds of requests, ‘Can I tweet on the TV now?’ ”Within two days, Verizon added that feature; users tap out messages on the number pad on the remote as if they were sending a text message on an older cellphone.Another lesson learned: one of the biggest impediments to adding more features to televisions is the remote control. It is difficult to enter text or even move quickly through complex menus.So the cable industry would have to redesign and replace old remotes as well as old set-top boxes that have limited memory and processing capabilities in tens of millions of homes.“The lowest end set-top box is the equivalent of a Mac II from 1991,” said Mr. Kotay of Comcast. Even recent models are hardly able to handle all the interactive tasks that developers have started to imagine, especially combining text, graphics and video from cable channels and the Internet. And the next generation will go further.For example, a box Echostar plans to introduce this year will have a full Internet browser that can play video from nearly any site on the Web.AT&T and Verizon, which only recently began competing directly with Comcast and Time Warner Cable, have the benefit of a technical fresh start. Their boxes have more computerlike features and faster Internet connections. AT&T’s U-verse service, for example, recently offered an interactive version of the Professional Golfers Association golf tournament that lets users switch between cameras aimed at different parts of the course.Comcast, Time Warner Cable and most of the other major cable companies are countering the phone companies by backing a standard called the Enhanced TV Binary Interchange Format. When it is put into place next year, it will allow all but the oldest set-top boxes to display simple interactive applications that are set off by certain programs and advertisements. One of the first uses of this software is to put the caller ID information on the TV screen when the phone rings.In theory, this standard will also let outside developers write applications that could run in tens of millions of homes. But the cable companies have not figured out how developers will submit applications and what sort of business models it will support. (Even Verizon has not published the terms of its new app store yet, but it hopes to split ad revenue or app purchase fees with developers.)Cable companies are betting that viewers may well want to see information and photographs related to the programs they watch and the actors in them. Other areas discussed include casual games, sports information and online shopping.Steve Necessary, the vice president for video product development at Cox Communications, said the company is wary of opening up too far because that would put the burden on the cable companies to make sure that applications do not display things that children should not see.“We want to provide tools to make sure parents can provide he proper level of monitoring,” Mr. Necessary said. “By no means do we want to be the troll under the bridge keeping applications from coming in.”Some people, however, wonder if one difference in the use of cellphones, which usually have a single user, and TVs, which are more often shared among family members, might create problems.Jeffrey G. Weber, AT&T’s vice president for video products, worries that opening the TV to applications like e-mail might encourage domestic disputes.“E-mail is a private thing,” he said. “What happens when the wife wants to read e-mail from her mother on the set when you want to watch the game?”'"
"'09-09-07,'0','PCs are evolving into tablet PCs and small laptops, essentially big smartphones that are always on, always connected to the Internet, with all-day battery life — in short, very much like a large iPhone or BlackBerry. Qualcomm calls these devices smartbooks because the design resembles a large smartphone.Mr. Jacobs sees his company at the center of an industry that is driving the most cutting-edge innovations, as seen in devices like the iPhone and BlackBerry Storm.“That energy is now coming out of the phone industry,” Mr. Jacobs said. “The PC became so standardized that the degree of innovation was not the same as what you see in the phone space.”Intel, whose revenue is approximately triple Qualcomm’s, disagrees. “As mobile devices become smarter with PC-like performance, computer and Internet capabilities, this is Intel’s strength,” an Intel spokeswoman, Suzy Ramirez, said.Qualcomm is counting on its Snapdragon chip to power these devices. Developed by a team of former I.B.M. engineers who worked on the PowerPC microprocessor, it is the first chip of its kind to reach a speed of 1 gigahertz, a significant milestone for ARM, a processor design renowned for using so little power the device’s battery can last all day.Snapdragon is already being used by Toshiba in its ultra-thin TG01 smartphone that is being sold in Europe. More devices using Snapdragon are expected later this year, Mr. Jacobs says.Hardware alone will not win the battle, however. Qualcomm has been working with Google, which developed the Android operating system for cellphones. The fruit of this partnership was T-Mobile’s G1 phone, the first smartphone using Android and a Qualcomm chip.“There was a lot engineering back and forth,” Mr. Jacobs said. “The thing that we’re doing now is helping them scale. Because they have a relatively small team focused on evolving the operating system.”What may prove more significant than Android is software that Google will bring out next year: the Chrome operating system, which is intended for larger, computerlike devices to challenge laptops running Windows.Qualcomm is betting that Google becomes a major operating software company.“They’re onto what the future of computing is,” said Bill Davidson, Qualcomm’s senior vice president for global marketing and investor relations. “It’s about taking advantage of the computational power that already exists within the Internet.”He went on: “The whole push for Chrome is to have the much thinner, lighter, smaller client so that you don’t need as much memory to run this big honking OS,” he said, referring to Microsoft’s Windows operating software.The Qualcomm chip will be designed to work with Chrome to move some of the computing functions off the device to fast computers based in data centers, a model the industry calls cloud computing.“I think a hybrid model is the model that will work best, where there are certain applications that are downloaded on the device and they live there,” Mr. Jacobs said. “And other ones that are coming up and down through the cloud. We’ll support both.”It is not going to be a cakewalk to displace the most potent partnership — Microsoft and Intel — in the history of the personal computer.“One of the key issues is brand,” said Matthew Wilkins, principal analyst for compute platforms research, at the market researcher iSuppli. “Google Chrome OS, Android and ARM are not traditionally seen in PC retail stores. Therefore they will be competing against established and recognized brands: Intel, Microsoft and Windows.”'"
"'09-09-07,'0','A climate-change bill that passed the House in June, intended to cap greenhouse gas emissions, delivered benefits to renewable fuels like wind and solar and strengthened building codes to conserve energy.But the cost of emitting carbon dioxide emissions under the terms of the bill remained at levels that would continue to provide a price advantage for coal in many regions of the country.The Senate is planning to begin writing its own bill later this month.“The Senate is more open to natural gas as a transition fuel than the House was,” said Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, “but the senators from the coal states who are crucial votes are going to want first consideration for coal.”The gas industry’s leaders say they will descend on Capitol Hill in coming weeks to press their case about the advantage of gas, including that it emits about half the greenhouse gases as coal.The industry has formed a new lobbying group, and it is planning a national campaign that includes television advertising. Executives want fewer allowances for coal. They also want legislation that gives incentives for companies to convert truck fleets from diesel to natural gas.“Never in my life have I been confronted with something so obviously easy and good to do and have such Congressional apathy,” said Aubrey McClendon, chief executive of Chesapeake Energy and a leading voice in the industry. He added that he was still hopeful the Senate can improve the House bill.But the coal industry will also be active. Vic Svec, a senior vice president at Peabody Energy, a large coal company, said coal was still a better fuel because its price is more stable than gas.“Coal with carbon capture and storage is the low cost, low carbon solution and has fantastic implications for the nation’s energy security,” he said.But it is not only coal-industry lobbyists and their Congressional supporters who favor the concept of carbon sequestration. David Hawkins, a climate change expert at the Natural Resources Defense Council, said simply replacing coal with natural gas for power generation was “not a viable strategy” because that would merely delay climate change by a few decades.“A coal plant with carbon capture and storage is a cleaner plant than an uncontrolled natural gas plant,” he said.Natural gas gets some benefits from the House bill, which includes a cap-and-trade system that sets limits on emissions of greenhouse gases while requiring manufacturers and utilities to acquire pollution permits.Utilities that burn natural gas would earn $30 billion over 10 years in pollution credits that could be sold on the carbon-trading market. But utilities that burn coal will receive tens of billions of dollars worth of free pollution credits, savings that will be passed on to consumers but may serve to delay the closing of some coal plants.The House bill also offers $10 billion for research and development of techniques to capture and store carbon dioxide emissions, which would help keep some coal plants open that might otherwise close.The Environmental Protection Agency projects that if the House bill became law, electricity generation from gas would increase by less than 1 percent from 2015 to 2025, while generation from coal would remain nearly unchanged.There will be more use of renewables, but power generation as a whole is expected to decline because of conservation efforts, including tightening of building energy codes.“By allowing free emission allowances to maintain coal production from existing coal plants, while providing mandates that there be more wind and solar, you squeeze gas out in the middle,” said William F. Whitsitt, an executive vice president at Devon Energy, a major natural gas producer.Without any new legislation, and if current policies remain in place, gas would beat out coal by a far larger margin, according to E.P.A. projections.There would be nearly 30 percent more power generated by gas by 2025 than in 2015, while coal fired generation would grow by a more modest 7 percent.Many legislators believe that carbon capture and sequestration — a largely untested system that would bury carbon at power plants so it does not escape into the atmosphere — can be made to work.Developing the technology was particularly important for any global solution to climate change, since China and India depend on coal for their energy and growing economies, said Paul W. Bledsoe, director of communications and strategy at the National Commission on Energy Policy, a bipartisan research organization.Currently, coal provides almost half the electrical power in the United States while natural gas provides more than 20 percent.Proponents of natural gas say they can deliver immediate reductions in greenhouse gases, an advantage that should not be discarded for an untested technology.Senate officials and energy officials say it will be difficult to develop legislation that benefits both the gas and coal industries and reduces greenhouse gases.Gas executives say their day in Washington will come, especially as more jobs are produced in gas fields that now stretch across 32 states.“The politics of natural gas are going to change dramatically,” predicted Rodney Lowman, president of the American Natural Gas Alliance, the new gas lobby group. But, he added, “it won’t be overnight.”'"
"'09-09-07,'0','In “The Blood,” played at P.S. 1 on Saturday afternoon, Glenn Branca’s sextet took a little time to establish the Stomp, but after a few minutes it arrived. Most of the scores Mr. Branca has composed for his electric-guitar ensembles contain parts for bass and drums too, and the Stomp makes its appearance, as reliable as the other parts are shifting.The Stomp is a four-four thump, straight from the garage. When the music gathers its prickly-heat tension, various guitars modulating at odds with one another and at least one playing steady drone chords, the Stomp becomes more stylized: a kind of rock habanera beat. If you have ever been shaken by some of Mr. Branca’s electric-guitar music — symphonies and shorter works — you have depended on this beat to carry you through it.Mr. Branca does too. When the beat showed up on Saturday, Mr. Branca, who conducted the ensemble at the head of the stairs in the courtyard of P.S. 1, in Long Island City, Queens, casually moved his hips, then his knees, locked together. Halfway through the performance he stood with legs wide apart, bluejeans cuffs rolled up, heels pumping, pompadour falling. Near the end he was slumped over, grasping the top of his music stand, rubbing his face in the score paper, still moving a leg.“The Blood” is brand new and “Lesson No. 3 (Tribute to Steve Reich),” the other piece played on Saturday, comes from 2006. Both were written for a band of four guitarists, a bassist and drummer, the same size group as on Mr. Branca’s record “The Ascension,” from 1981. The return to a small ensemble is a deserved victory lap; his old music has endured, and still sounds great. It’s also a blow scored for the power of simplicity, after his 13th symphony, “Hallucination City,” first played in 2001, which used 100 musicians. The pieces performed Saturday show that his basic idea is strong enough that it doesn’t necessarily need a villagefull of players to make its point.“The Blood,” the longer of the two pieces, alternated unison simplicity with harmonic discord. At the beginning the guitarists jumped octaves together. In a slower section the guitarists played chords in dissonant, staggered patterns (and Mr. Branca lighted a cigarette). Then they worked together again, climbing upward in semitones. Toward the end he conducted some improvisations, telling guitarists where to go and how loud to play, before ending the piece in concordance, the drums accelerating to a sudden punk ending.Mr. Branca’s music is New York to the core, or at least what some New York art was around 1981: hard earned, abrasive, frequently awesome. In a short, excellent set following Mr. Branca’s, Coati Mundi evoked that place and time too.'"
"'09-09-07,'0','SEOUL, South Korea — North Korea unleashed walls of water from one or more of its dams on Sunday, sending a flash flood roaring through the heavily armed border with South Korea and sweeping away six South Koreans, officials in Seoul said.The six South Koreans, who are still missing, include an 8-year-old boy. They were camping or fishing on the Imjin River, which flows from the North, enters South Korea north of Seoul, and meanders close to the border before emptying into the Yellow Sea.“The government will send a telegram to the North on Monday to protest and demand a satisfying explanation,” the Unification Ministry of South Korea said in a statement.Officials said the Imjin River’s water level on the border doubled, to 15.1 feet, after North Korea began releasing water without warning at 2 a.m. on Sunday, either from its newly built Hwanggang Dam 17 miles north of the border or from a smaller dam downstream.No heavy rain was reported in North Korea in recent days, according to South Korean weather officials.It remained unclear whether the North unleashed the water by accident or to provoke the South. In recent weeks, North Korea has alternated harsh statements and claims of nuclear advances with conciliatory gestures, as tensions ran high over international sanctions imposed on the Communist state following its nuclear test in May.'"

"'09-09-08,'1','The campaign includes a sweepstakes; online and social media efforts; materials in stores; and sponsored video clips to be shown at the beginning of each show at the Improv comedy clubs and its sibling chain, Funny Bone.Butterfinger spent more than a decade making consumers laugh with a campaign featuring bratty Bart Simpson, which carried the theme “Nobody better lay a finger on my Butterfinger.” Those ads ended at the start of the 2000s (or whatever this decade is called) and the brand ran campaigns with themes like “Follow the Finger.”But Butterfinger resumed its joking ways on April Fools’ Day 2008 with a fake announcement of a name change from Butterfinger to the Finger. That was followed a day later by the introduction of the Butterfinger Comedy Network on Yahoo.The search for laughs has continued with a humorous campaign by Dailey & Associates in West Hollywood, Calif., part of the Interpublic Group of Companies. The ads carry a theme that takes a slightly different tack from the Bart era, as the slogan morphs into “Nobody’s gonna lay a finger on my Butterfinger.”The new theme is being brought to life in commercials that depict the consequences of Butterfinger-filching. For instance, in a spot now running, set at an office, a Butterfinger thief receiving rough justice from the co-worker whose candy he tried to snatch.“We looked at our target, young adults 18 to 34, and a lot of their favorite TV shows are comedy shows, ‘The Office,’ ’30 Rock,’ ” says Daniel Jhung, brand manager for Butterfinger at the confectionery and snacks division of Nestlé USA in Glendale, Calif., part of the global food giant, Nestlé S.A.The target market also like “going to comedy clubs,” he adds, as well as “watching and trading funny videos online.”Factor in the “the brand’s heritage, an equity and personality build around clever, irreverent humor,” Mr. Jhung says, and it is not difficult to see why Butterfinger has returned to seeking bucks in yuks.The initiatives the brand is taking include becoming “the first comedy sponsor at Bonnaroo,” he adds, the annual music and arts festival near Nashville, where a Butterfinger Comedy Tent hosted the comedians Michael Ian Black and Michael Showalter of the new Comedy Central series “Michael and Michael Have Issues.”“They did some tweeting for us on Twitter,” Mr. Jhung says, as part of the strategy to use social media like twitter.com to help promote the brand.There was also a cadre of four Butterfinger “funterns” — summer interns, ages 18 to 28, who were based in Atlanta, Chicago, Los Angeles and New York and created candy-centric content for Facebook, Twitter and YouTube.The tie-in with the comedy clubs offers “a great, real-life extension of the strategy,” Mr. Jhung says, particularly in reaching college-age consumers.The video clips sponsored by Butterfinger that will be screened before shows will offer a look at life on the road for three comedians. Two of them, Ron G and Amy Schumer, are finalists from the reality series “Last Comic Standing,” and the third, Owen Benjamin, has appeared in series like “Mad TV” and movies like “The House Bunny.”There will also be signs in the clubs, sampling and MC’s who will “do a riff on the brand,” Mr. Jhung says.The sweepstakes is called the Butterfinger and Improv (or Funny Bone) Coast-to-Coast Comedy Trip — or the Butterfinger/Improv Comedy Tour, for short. The grand prize is a comedy vacation package for four people to see a comedy show in each of four cities — Denver, Los Angeles, Miami and New York — in nine days.If comedy is hard, so, too, is creating effective forms of branded entertainment. For every hit, managing to sell products with a laugh, a smile or a tear, there are numerous flops, primarily those projects that consumers perceive to be overly commercialized.“The thing we tell everyone is: ‘Don’t think it’s a simple process. You really have to get into the weeds,’ ” says Claudia Cahill, executive vice president for corporate development at the Medium unit of Levity Entertainment in Los Angeles. That is the company’s unit specializing in branded entertainment; others are focused on tasks like digital marketing, producing programming and talent management.Branded entertainment requires “having an understanding of two very different mindsets,” Ms. Cahill says, referring to the consumer and the marketer, which makes it “an exciting and challenging discipline.”Then there is also the care and feeding of the performers (and writers) who are asked to integrate brand messages into their work. Some take to the assignment with evident enjoyment, among them Stephen Colbert, who gleefully peddles products like Doritos snacks and Sierra Mist soda during episodes of “The Colbert Report” on Comedy Central.Others walk a fine line between delivering product pitches and sending up their patrons. The radio and television host Arthur Godfrey was notorious for such tightrope acts, as in a TV spot he delivered in 1954 for a big sponsor, Lipton, in which, Time magazine reported, he said: “When it comes to the chicken in Lipton’s soup, you’ve got to have faith. Just like it says in the Bible.”Godfrey was said to have been a model for the character of Lonesome Rhodes in the screenplay written by Budd Schulberg for the 1957 film “A Face in the Crowd,” which was one of the first movies to suggest that the power of TV — and TV advertisers — could be used for demagogic purposes. Rhodes, played by Andy Griffith, becomes popular in part for his aw-shucks way of kidding the sponsors of his shows.Another drawback to branded entertainment based on comedy is that everyone has a different opinion of what is funny — and what is not.For example, a post last month on adfreak.com, a blog from Adweek, poked fun at Butterfinger for discovering “something interesting about its young-adult target demo: that they love clever, irreverent humor!”“I had always thought that was universal,” wrote the author of the post, Rebecca Cullers, “but what do I know?” She also mocked the decision to try “appealing to people who like comedy by advertising in comedy clubs” by declaring, “It’s so obvious, it might just be brilliant!”Mr. Jhung is taking the gibes with a smile, noting that Butterfinger has been pursuing its “humor-based strategy” for many years.If you like In Advertising, be sure to read the Advertising column that runs Monday through Friday in the Business Day section of The New York Times print edition and on nytimes.com.'"

"'09-09-08,'1','SAN FRANCISCO — Commuters in the San Francisco Bay Area were bracing for an arduous commute on Tuesday morning after slow-going repairs to a cracked support forced the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge to remain closed an extra day.The bridge has been shut to traffic since Thursday night as part of a project to retrofit its eastern section, a portion of which collapsed during the Loma Prieta earthquake in 1989.That work, which involved replacing a 300-foot span with a detour, was finished on schedule. But during a routine inspection on Saturday, workers discovered an unrelated crack in a circular link, known as an eyebar, also on the eastern span. Workers toiled all day Monday to make repairs, but more time was needed, said Randy Iwasaki, the director of the California Department of Transportation.“We’re going to need your patience for one more day,” he said. The new target for the reopening of the bridge, which connects San Francisco and the western peninsula to Oakland and suburban communities to the east, is Wednesday at 5 a.m., a full 24 hours later than expected.Other local transit agencies had already made contingency plans in the event that the bridge did not reopen on time.Ferry companies added boats, in some cases tripling the number of trips across the bay. The Bay Area Rapid Transit, the region’s major commuter railway, planned to run longer trains on Tuesday. The Transportation Department advised people to consider carpools and even telecommuting. The Bay Bridge handles about 260,000 vehicles a day.Engineers said the damaged eyebar had probably cracked in the last two years, since the bridge’s last inspection. And while the repairs were taking time, Mr. Iwasaki said the work was worth it.'"
"'09-09-08,'1','With Pike directing traffic at the line of scrimmage, the Bearcats raced down the field to open the game, covering 81 yards in 2 minutes 29 seconds without an incomplete pass. Pead capped the drive with a 2-yard run.Rutgers’s response to Cincinnati’s speed was a methodical, 20-play, 78-yard drive that took more than 10 minutes and ended on a 5-yard touchdown run by Joe Martinek. But its success did not last.Rutgers quarterback Domenic Natale, a senior who is replacing the departed Mike Teel, held the ball too long and had several throws sail high. Cincinnati turned his first two interceptions into touchdowns. Natale left open the possibility that his first career start could be his last, especially after the highly regarded freshman Tom Savage played the second half, completing 15 of 23 for 135 yards and a touchdown.Pike went 20 of 25 in the first half for 286 yards, with touchdown passes of 5 yards to Gilyard and 41 yards to Pead as the Bearcats raced to a 31-7 halftime lead.Cincinnati even gave Rutgers a dose of the Wildcat with the redshirt freshman tight end Travis Kelce, a former quarterback. Kelce took two snaps, gaining 16 yards to finish off the first of three consecutive second-quarter touchdown drives. The runs were the first two touches of Kelce’s career.Kelce added a 2-yard touchdown run in the third quarter.“I thought we were a step behind all day — two steps,” Rutgers Coach Greg Schiano said.The result was not what Rutgers had in mind for the first game in its renovated stadium. The two-year project to enclose the stadium, put in luxury suites and install a new scoreboard increased capacity from about 42,000 to more than 52,000 and cost $102 million.A crowd of 53,737 was raucous early, quiet and dejected by halftime and mostly out the door by the fourth quarter.BRADFORD OUT 2-4 WEEKS Oklahoma quarterback Sam Bradford is not expected to need surgery on his sprained right shoulder and could play again for No. 3 Oklahoma in two to four weeks.“Everyone’s different in how they heal, the soreness, how they handle it and how quickly it dissipates where he can move and be comfortable again throwing the ball,” Oklahoma Coach Bob Stoops said after practice.Stoops said the initial evaluations by doctors showed that Bradford did not sustain damage to his collarbone, rotator cuff or other parts of his shoulder when he sprained his AC joint just before halftime in Oklahoma’s 14-13 loss to No. 20 Brigham Young on Saturday. Those evaluations also did not suggest surgery.“In my mind, that’s completely out,” Bradford said of the prospect of surgery. “That’s probably a little biased because obviously I want to be out there playing.”Bradford said he spoke Sunday with Giants quarterback Eli Manning, who had a bruised AC joint during the Giants’ run to the Super Bowl two years ago.“It does feel a lot better today, not nearly as painful as it was Saturday,” Bradford said. “Hopefully, I can keep progressing like this.”'"

"'09-09-08,'1','Google also said in a letter to publishers that it had offered European publishers representation on a board to oversee a “book rights registry,” which will distribute royalties from digital book sales under the plan proposed by the settlement.“As we said, we listen carefully to all concerns of stakeholders around the globe and work hard to achieve the common goal of bringing back to life millions of lost books in a way that serves the interest of all,” Google said in a statement.The American court has set Tuesday as the deadline for submissions on the settlement and will hold a hearing on the matter on Oct. 7.David Wood, a lawyer representing Icomp, the Initiative for a Competitive Online Marketplace, a mostly Europe-based industry group backed by Microsoft that is opposed to the proposed settlement, said the concessions showed that European interests could be accommodated, but far more needed to be done to ease ongoing concerns.Governance of the registry was a “relatively minor” issue, Mr. Wood said. Of greater importance, he said, were worries that the settlement, as drafted, would reinforce Google’s online dominance.“There are widespread concerns that the settlement leads to monopolization in digital access to online access and sales of books in Europe and in other parts of the world as well as effects on other markets, such as search and search advertising,” he said.Sylvie Foder of Cepic, the Coordination of European Picture Agencies Stock Heritage, said at a news conference that she was particularly concerned about what could happen to the rights to photographs inside printed books once they are digitized. “Google can pretty much do what it wants,” she said.Jessica Sänger, the legal counsel at the German Publishers and Booksellers Association, said the settlement would heavily discriminate against European publishers that were not involved in its drafting.She said she was not opposed to digitization but that more time was needed to propose a solution that would be appropriate for Europe, which has its own digitization projects under way. The European Commission has supported homegrown digitization projects, including the Europeana online book and cultural database.“We’re not quite as slow and old-fashioned as we’re made out to be some of the time,” she said.'"
"'09-09-08,'1','“We’re concerned about the high number of flight attendant injuries,” said Christopher J. Witkowski, director of air safety for the union. “It seems as if there is some complacency on the issue.”Toni Higgins was one of two flight attendants with Midwest Airlines seriously hurt in 2003. Her injuries kept her out of work for a year. Her colleague never did return to flying.“I remember hitting the ceiling the first time and the second I don’t remember because I was unconscious,” she said.The pilots had warned of turbulence on the flight. Mrs. Higgins said she had walked through the cabin to make sure all passengers were buckled up. According to the report by the safety board, she had returned to her seat but had not fastened her belt when the DC-9 dropped suddenly.“Typically, if it’s going to be bad the pilots will call us and say, ‘Hey, it’s going to be pretty rough and we want you guys to sit down, too,’ ” she said. “But they didn’t do that. It happened very quickly.”While some turbulence is anticipated — the kind associated with storms can actually be seen on radar in the cockpit — sometimes it is unanticipated and unavoidable, as in Mrs. Higgins’s case. And clear-air turbulence is invisible.“Sometimes a pilot doesn’t have much warning of imminent turbulence,” said Peter Frey, an airline pilot, who is also an air safety investigator. “They’ll say, ‘Clean up and sit down.’ But if the carts are out and meals and airline trays are all over the place, it may take them more than five minutes to clean up.”Since 1990, the number of turbulence accidents involving injuries has remained somewhat consistent, with a high of 14 in one year but never fewer than five. “We look into every injury from turbulence to determine if and when procedures need to be changed,” Les Dorr, a spokesman for the Federal Aviation Administration, said.After two particularly bad years in 2003 and 2004, the agency sent an advisory to airlines to pass along to their employees. “You are not invincible,” it read, reminding flight attendants that the safety of passengers may depend on their “self preservation.”“The F.A.A. requires the presence of flight attendants on aircraft, and it’s not to serve peanuts and soft drinks,” said Barry Schimmel a representative for the international airline division of the Teamsters, which includes flight attendants. He cited the crash-landing of a US Airways jetliner on the Hudson River in January, with the pilot, Chesley B. Sullenberger, credited with saving the lives of his passengers. “As heroic an act as Captain Sullenberger did, he didn’t evacuate that aircraft. It was the three flight attendants that got those passengers safely off the aircraft.”One of the flight attendants on the Miami-bound flight said the attendants pressed on to finish the service, because “Ingrained in us from years of training is, do the service, do the service, do the service.”The F.A.A. guidance on avoiding injuries is 11 pages long, with multiple references to the unpredictability of the problem and the need for everyone to exercise judgment and discretion. For example, when turbulence is strong, flight attendants can forgo walking through the aircraft to check if passengers are securely fastened in.“If it gets really turbulent, it’s not logical to put yourself at risk to check seat belts,” said Nora Marshall, chief of the survival factors unit at the National Transportation Safety Board.But for some airline workers — whether it is stopping service to passengers or working through what seems to be manageable bumps — what seems logical at the time may seem foolish after the fact.“Unfortunately, the end result is we’ll have flight attendants sitting in their jump seats when they and the passengers will feel they could have gotten up and done a service,” Captain Frey said. “So even if you institute tighter controls to make sure everyone is seated and secure, they’re likely to say the system is overly protective.”'"
"'09-09-08,'1','QUITO, Ecuador (Reuters) — The Chevron Corporation said Monday that it gave Ecuadorean authorities videos and e-mail messages it said provided evidence of a bribery scheme linked to a $27 billion environmental damages lawsuit against the oil company.Last week, the judge hearing the case, Juan Núñez, recused himself just days after Chevron handed Ecuadorean and American authorities a secretly recorded video of the magistrate talking of ruling against Chevron later this year.Ecuador’s attorney general began investigating the bribery and misconduct accusations against Mr. Núñez after Chevron said it would ask for him to be disqualified from the case. The judge says he committed no wrongdoing.“In a letter to Ecuador authorities, the company asked that several important points be examined by the investigation into the scheme, which implicated the judge hearing the case, as well as ruling party and government officials,” the company said in a statement.Chevron has complained before about government interference in the 16-year-old case, in which indigenous communities have accused Texaco, bought by Chevron in 2001, of damaging the environment and their health while operating petroleum facilities in the region.An expert appointed by the Ecuadorean court said last year that Chevron should pay around $27 billion, including more than $8 billion in unjust enrichment.'"
"'09-09-08,'1','While the I.R.S. and UBS have pledged to make the sealed document public by Nov. 17, the lawyers say that it is likely to be short on specifics, because the I.R.S. does not want people with offshore accounts to know the criteria it is using to pursue tax cheats.Disclosing specifics would cause tax evaders who fall below the limits to feel safe from disclosure by their banks, and to see no need to come forward voluntarily to the I.R.S. In tandem with the Swiss deal, the I.R.S. is encouraging UBS clients to disclose their assets by Sept. 23 — a parallel program that underscores how the accord with Switzerland may not net everyone.“The identification of the filters that were used” in the deal “is an explosive issue, probably both in the U.S. and in Switzerland,” Mr. Rosenbloom said. “The criteria used represent the boundary between what Switzerland considers fraud” and “what the U.S. considers acceptable versus unacceptable tax avoidance.”An I.R.S. spokeswoman, Michelle Eldridge, declined to comment on the criteria.Unlike United States law, Swiss law distinguishes between tax evasion, which is legal, and tax fraud, which is not. Hiding cash to evade tax is not fraud under Swiss law. In Switzerland, tax fraud includes making false statements and signing documents that disguise the owners of the offshore assets.While Switzerland has agreed to expand its definition of tax fraud, it has not disclosed any specifics. Under the accord, UBS will turn over client names to the Swiss tax authorities, which will review them and decide whether to forward them to the I.R.S. As a result, tax lawyers said, some large, cash-only accounts may not be disclosed because Swiss authorities may find no evidence of fraud.“There’s a great deal of ambiguity regarding who will be disclosed,” said William Sharp, a tax lawyer in Tampa, Fla., who represents UBS clients.UBS has said that it has 52,000 American clients — the number originally sought by the I.R.S. and the Justice Department — meaning that it will disclose fewer than one in 10 names. Those 4,450 clients hold a total of $18 billion in assets.“They are understandably trying to spook people into coming forward,” Mr. Rosenbloom said. “I doubt that strategy works for large account holders, particularly in a world where they will receive notice from UBS in advance of a disclosure. They will, of course, wait to see whether that notice arrives. And I suspect some will escape the filters.”'"

"'09-09-08,'1','The authors nicely combine commitment with caution about what we know and don’t know, what does good and what might not. The many failures of foreign aid are not neglected; the aim is simply to show that recognition can stimulate improvement.Similarly, their attitude toward sex work is nuanced. Although they favor crackdowns on all sex work as the best means of changing traffickers’ economic incentives, they also present the argument for decriminalization with regulation. The readability of the book should not make one underestimate the care of the analysis.By locating the problems they describe in the “developing world,” Mr. Kristof and Ms. WuDunn surely paint too rosy a picture of what happens to women in richer countries. There, they say, “discrimination is usually a matter of unequal pay or underfunded sports teams or unwanted touching from a boss.” Tell that to the 18 percent of women in the United States who, according to the authoritative National Violence Against Women Survey, say they have experienced rape or attempted rape. Acknowledging misogyny close to home helps us think better about its sources and possible remedies.Still, the book is both stirring and sensible. The problems are important, they hamper development, and progress can be made on all of them if the political will can be forged. So, while not denying that solutions ultimately require governments to get involved, the authors focus on the creation of a worldwide momentum toward solution and appeal to readers to join in a wide range of nongovernmental organizations working on gender equality.There’s one weak chapter, called “Is Islam Misogynistic?” Although the authors ultimately suggest that the answer, at least historically, is “no,” their account of the religious history is too superficial to be useful. Nor do they give a systematic account of the wide range of contemporary movements that are both Islamic and feminist. Along the way, they feed some stereotypes that readers are all too likely to hold.“Of the countries where women are held back and subjected to systematic abuses such as honor killings and genital cutting, a very large proportion are predominantly Muslim,” they write. If we confine ourselves to these two examples, the statement may be true (although genital cutting has no basis in Islam).“Such as,” however, suggests a longer list. The authors have already told us that maternal mortality is a particularly large problem in Sub-Saharan Africa, where Muslims are not in a majority. (The annual United Nations Human Development Report confirms this.)Their account of forced prostitution highlights the problems of countries that are not predominantly Muslim (e.g. India, Thailand, Cambodia), as well as of some Muslim nations. We’ve been given no reason to suppose that Muslim nations do worse. Later, moreover, the authors praise Muslim-majority Bangladesh as a shining example of what can happen when a nation decides to invest in women and girls.The gravest problem, one that the authors mention but never treat in detail, is the basic denial to girls of life itself, whether through infanticide, discriminatory nutrition and health care in childhood, or the increasingly common practice of sex-selective abortion. Here the nations of East Asia leap into prominence. The natural ratio of girls to boys at birth is typically taken to be 95 to 100. In Singapore and Taiwan, the figure is 92 girls to 100 boys, in South Korea 88, in China only 86.These figures reflect only sex-selective abortion, and not deaths after birth from infanticide or differential nutrition and medical care. The overall sex ratio, which does include these deaths, is even more striking: China and South Korea have two of the most unbalanced sex ratios in the world.We’d have to discuss those figures (worse than those of almost all majority-Muslim nations) before making any responsible statement about which cultures are more or less misogynistic.In the same chapter the authors make a rare inaccurate statement. “Hindu women in India are more autonomous and more likely to be educated than their Muslim women neighbors.” But the only comprehensive survey of Muslim women in India, the highly regarded 2005 study by Zoya Hasan and Ritu Menon, concluded that (adjusting for poverty level, since Muslims are a relatively deprived group in most parts of the nation) the significant differences are regional rather than religious. “Religion per se does not influence the status of women,” they summarize.Mr. Kristof and Ms. WuDunn, so curious elsewhere, seem unaware of this well-known evidence. In short, why not just confront each manifestation of misogyny where one finds it, rather than play a ratings game that fits too neatly with widespread political prejudices?This criticism aside, however, this wonderful book combines a denunciation of horrible abuses with clear-eyed hope and some compelling practical strategies. The courageous women described here, and millions more like them, deserve nothing less.'"
"'09-09-08,'1','As oil and gas companies press to tap new deposits in remote places, scientists are trying to gauge and limit the ecological impact of pipes and other structures in otherwise wild lands.Nowhere is that effort more intense than on the Arctic coastal plain of the North Slope of Alaska  a Maine-size stretch of open lands that is snow-blown and ice sheathed in winter, but a verdant breeding ground for caribou and millions of birds in summer.Since oil was discovered 40 years ago, 1,000 square miles of the plain have become peppered with wells and laced with pipes. In response to research on caribou, pipelines were elevated 10 feet in hundreds of places so herds could pass unimpeded.Now a study has for the first time assessed the impact on nesting birds from so-called subsidized predators  the ravens, gulls and arctic foxes that thrive around the garbage bins, nesting sites and hiding places afforded by oil fields.From 2002 to 2005, biologists from the Fish and Wildlife Service, two environmental groups and two oil companies, tracked more than 1,800 nests and found that the risk to passerine birds, the group of perching species including songbirds, was higher the closer the nest was to such structures. Most of the monitored passerine nests belonged to Lapland longspurs.Among wading shorebirds sandpipers seemed to face no increased risk, but red and red-necked phalaropes, assessed together, did suffer more losses, said Joe Liebezeit, a biologist with the Wildlife Conservation Society and the lead author of the study, published in the September issue of the journal Ecological Applications.Steven Kendall, an ornithologist with the federal Fish and Wildlife Service and a study author, said subtle impacts could be important, given the decline of many species due to loss of habitat. He said companies should continue successful efforts to prevent wildlife from getting access to garbage while trying to design structures to limit nesting, perching and hiding places.Bill Streever, a study author who assesses environmental issues for BP Exploration, said the company was committed “to continuously improve wildlife management on the North Slope.”'"
"'09-09-08,'1','Ignoring the uproar surrounding his back-to-school address, President Obama plans to urge America’s schoolchildren on Tuesday to dream big dreams and respect their teachers, to study hard and learn from failure.“We can have the most dedicated teachers, the most supportive parents and the best schools in the world,” Mr. Obama will tell students, according to remarks released in advance by the White House. “And none of it will matter unless all of you fulfill your responsibilities.”In recent days, conservative talk show hosts and some Republican leaders have attacked plans for the speech, ascribing dark motives to the White House, and parents from Virginia to California have besieged schools with calls. Secretary of Education Arne Duncan called the uproar “silly,” and over the weekend some Republicans distanced themselves from the critics.After reading the text on Monday, even Jim Greer, the Florida Republican Party chairman who last week accused the president of seeking to use the speech to foist “socialist ideology” on schoolchildren, said he could find nothing to criticize in its text.""In its current form, it’s fine,” Mr. Greer said in an interview. “But it remains to be seen if it’s the speech he’s going to give.”The address, posted on the White House Web site, is to be broadcast live from Wakefield High School in Arlington, Va. It is a pep talk intended to energize the nation’s youths to seek academic success, for their own sake and for their country’s.“If you get a bad grade, that doesn’t mean you’re stupid, it just means you need to spend more time studying,” Mr. Obama said.Administration officials who last week seemed beleaguered by the criticism over the speech said on Monday that they believed it might have allowed them to demonstrate that Republicans were simply intent on attacking anything Mr. Obama proposes.“It’s a sad state of affairs that many in this country politically would rather start an ‘Animal House’ food fight rather than inspire kids to stay in school, to work hard, to engage parents to stay involved,” said Robert Gibbs, the White House press secretary.It was unclear how many of America’s 50 million schoolchildren would watch. Most of the nation’s 15,000 school districts were preparing to show the speech, at noon Eastern time, while making alternative arrangements for students whose parents do not want them to view it.“Most districts are going to leave this decision up to school principals, and most of the principals will leave it up to teachers,” said Bruce Hunter, a director at the American Association of School Administrators.Nora K. Carr, chief of staff to the superintendent of the Guilford County Schools in North Carolina, was among the many educators who reviewed the text of the speech after it was posted on the White House Web site, www.whitehouse.gov.“Its refreshing, frankly, to see a leader talk about the need for students to take personal responsibility,” Ms. Carr said. “It makes you wonder what all the fuss was about.”Last week many Guilford County parents called schools in anger, many after hearing conservative radio attacks on the planned speech. By week’s end, other parents were expressing anger at the district’s intention to allow parents to opt out, she said.“It’s getting increasingly difficult to find common ground, even for something as simple as a speech by the sitting president,” Ms. Carr said.In New York, where the first day of school is Wednesday, students who want to watch the speech live will need to take their own initiative by visiting the White House Web site or tuning in to C-Span. Most schools in the Los Angeles Unified School District also resume on Wednesday, but about 90 are already open and the speech will be shown to students who want to watch, officials said.“The students of Los Angeles Unified have been provided with an extraordinary opportunity to engage in a teachable moment by watching President Obama speak to our youth,” Ramon Cortines, the superintendent, told administrators on Monday.More than half of the nation’s districts are already in session. In hundreds of other school systems, including Michigan’s 600 districts and Virginia’s 180 districts, students return to classes on Tuesday. The Loudoun County, Va., district was one where officials decided not to show the speech, arguing that first-day schedules were too busy to accommodate a presidential interruption.Mr. Greer, the Florida Republican chairman, said that a list of suggested classroom activities distributed by the Department of Education to accompany the speech had been an unwarranted intrusion into local school matters. But he said he would have no problem letting his own children watch the speech.In his address, Mr. Obama plans to recall his own struggles with class work, especially when his mother decided to tutor him before dawn each day.“Now, I wasn’t too happy about getting up that early,” Mr. Obama said. “A lot of times, I’d fall asleep right there at the kitchen table. But whenever I’d complain, my mother would just give me one of those looks and say, ‘This is no picnic for me either, buster.’ ”'"
"'09-09-08,'1','Japan has been under pressure to set tougher climate policies after its emissions hit a record in 2008, putting the country 16 percent above targets set 12 years ago in the global-warming treaty known as the Kyoto Protocol.Even with Mr. Hatoyama’s caveat, environmentalists lauded Japan’s new reductions target as going significantly further than the goals set by the departing government of Taro Aso, which had been roundly criticized. They also said Japan could help build momentum ahead of a summit meeting on climate change in Copenhagen this year.The European Union has promised to cut emissions to 20 percent below 1990 levels, and by 30 percent if other wealthy nations follow suit. In the United States, Congress is debating a bill that would reduce emissions to 6 percent below 1990 levels.Martin Kaiser, climate policy director at Greenpeace International, said Japan’s target under the new government was “the first sign of climate leadership we have seen out of any developed country for quite some time.”Yvo de Boer, executive secretary for the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, also praised Japan, saying its emissions target “is commensurate with what science says is needed and will catalyze real change in the Japanese economy.”Still, Mr. Hatoyama’s pledge is expected to face stiff opposition from industrial lobbies, which argue that Japanese industry is already highly energy efficient, and that committing to such steep emissions cuts will hurt an economy struggling through its worst recession in decades.A government report issued earlier this year showed that pursuing a 25 percent cut from 1990 levels could hurt important manufacturing industries, threatening almost 90 million jobs and weighing on household incomes.Keidanren, Japan’s biggest business federation, has said it opposes any cut bigger than 6 percent from 1990 levels.Others call Mr. Hatoyama’s targets naïve and a threat to Japan’s competitiveness.“I don’t think Mr. Hatoyama realizes what he is committing Japan to,” said Tsutomu Toichi, managing director at the Institute of Energy Economics, a Tokyo-based research group. “He has to realize that this is not a campaign slogan. It’s an international pledge to which Japan will be held accountable.”Some critics have pointed to other policies in the Democrats’ campaign platform that seem to contradict their commitment to reducing greenhouse emissions. The party swept to power on a promise of wide-ranging measures to lift Japan out of recession.To help households, for example, the Democrats have proposed ending highway tolls and a gas surcharge. Environmentalists say such moves could lead to a shift away from public transportation and increase pollution.It is also not clear how much of the emissions cuts will come from real reductions in Japan, rather than so-called carbon offsets, which allow governments to pay others to make their carbon reductions for them.“We’ll have to monitor how the Democrats balance various policies going forward,” said Masako Konishi, climate policy adviser to the conservation group W.W.F. Japan. “But Mr. Hatoyama’s ambitions go far beyond anything we’ve seen in Japan.”Experts say Japan’s new climate change agenda should press other countries to prepare similarly ambitious targets before the meeting in Copenhagen. Almost 200 countries are expected to attend Dec. 6 to 18 to set worldwide goals for reducing carbon dioxide and other pollutants.There is concern, however, that the Obama administration, embroiled in a debate over health care, will not have time to win Congress’s support on emissions reductions before the conference.Deciding how much wealthy countries like the United States and Japan should cut emissions — and how much that burden should be borne by emerging economies like China and India, which are big polluters — will be a major issue in Copenhagen.Rajendra Pachauri, chairman of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a global scientific body, said the new Japanese government could play a leading role in those talks.“With leaders like Mr. Hatoyama attending,” Mr. Pachauri said, “there is every reason to believe that we will get a strong agreement in Copenhagen.”'"
"'09-09-08,'1','There is a long tradition of eating dogs in southern China, where dog bones with cut marks on them have been found at archaeological sites.Dr. Savolainen said wolves probably domesticated themselves when they began scavenging around the garbage dumps at the first human settlements, a theory advocated by Ray Coppinger, a dog biologist at Hampshire College in Massachusetts. As the wolves became tamer, they would have been captured and bred. Given local traditions, Dr. Savolainen suggests, the wolves may have been bred for the table.Thus, dogs may have thus insinuated themselves into human life by means of garbage and dog meat, but they quickly assumed less demeaning roles. Once domesticated, they rapidly spread west from the eastern end of the Eurasian continent.Most people do not eat dogs, so they must have spread so quickly for other reasons, perhaps because of their use as guard dogs or in pulling sleds, Dr. Savolainen said.His report was written with Jun-Feng Pang of the Kunming Institute of Zoology in China, who analyzed the DNA of the many Chinese dogs in the study. It was published last week in the journal Molecular Biology and Evolution.In 2002, Dr. Savolainen wrote that dogs had been domesticated from wolves in East Asia, a conclusion that was challenged last month by a team at Cornell University. The Cornell team said genetic diversity was as high in African village dogs as in those in China.Dr. Savolainen disputed the Cornell calculation in his new report, contending that diversity was, in fact, higher in Chinese dogs.Adam Boyko, a member of the Cornell team, said that Dr. Savolainen’s team had now built a plausible hypothesis from detailed genetic data but that other explanations might still be possible, including that dogs had been domesticated at a second site, outside China, and had spread everywhere but China.Stephen O’Brien, an expert on the genetics of domestication at the National Cancer Institute, said Dr. Savolainen’s argument for a single domestication event in southern China was “a pretty good conclusion” but one that could be strengthened by a more thorough sampling of wolves throughout the world.A team of American researchers is examining the genetics of dogs and wolves with a so-called dog chip, a device that is programmed to recognize thousands of different sites on the dog and wolf genome, not just the mitochondrial DNA studied by Dr. Savolainen. The data have not yet been published, but some of it “doesn’t agree completely” with an East Asian origin of dogs, Dr. O’Brien said.The disputes about the origins of dogs arise because researchers are just cutting their teeth on what Dr. O’Brien called “genomic archaeology.”“It’s a brand new field,” he said. “We’re just learning how to do it.”Domestication of the dog and other animals is both of intrinsic interest and of relevance to the human past. “Domestication was really the lever by which civilization was able to organize into communities larger than those of foraging families,” Dr. O’Brien said.Dogs were evidently so useful to early people that they spread like wildfire. On the basis of current evidence, they were the first species to be domesticated.'"

This is exactly the kind of thing you tend to see during recovery phases of the cycle,” he said.The Nikkei in Japan closed 1.3 percent higher, or 133.83 points, to 10,320.94, after hitting a five-week closing low on Friday.“The current equity rally has further to go,” Morgan Stanley analysts said in a note. “A growth cycle is starting, we intend to buy on weakness.” The Nikkei was also helped by gains in Shanghai shares, which investors had been watching after China eased inbound investment rules on Friday.“There are expectations of a lot more investment in China, and if Asian markets recover, so does the Nikkei,” said Noritsugu Hirakawa, a strategist at Okasan Securities. China announced new draft rules on Friday on inbound portfolio investments, increasing the amount some institutions are permitted to invest in its stock markets.American job losses were the smallest in a year in August, and below forecasts, at 216,000. But the unemployment rate rose to 9.7 percent in August, from 9.4 percent in July, the highest in 26 years and above expectations.Despite the gains on Monday, equity markets have pulled back somewhat from the sharp rally that began in March. The world index lost nearly 1.5 percent last week, the first decline in eight weeks and only the fifth since the rally began.Some degree of risk aversion — in addition to a weaker dollar — was evident on the gold market.The Australian dollar hit its strongest level against the dollar in a year as shares gained after a G-20 pledge to keep economic stimulus packages in place.“The G-20 was positive for risk appetite, you can see that from the yen and dollar’s performance,” said Geoffrey Yu, a currency strategist at UBS. “At the same time people are still a bit cautious as we are approaching the end of this policy cycle.”Against the yen, the dollar was flat to slightly stronger at 93.00 yen.The euro gained 0.3 percent to $1.4336, near a one-week high but still below an eight-month high in August at $1.4448.'"
"'09-09-08,'1','ZURICH (Reuters) — Switzerland and Britain signed a new treaty that gives British tax authorities more access to banking information, and brings Switzerland closer to being removed from a list of international tax havens.The deal contains a provision for an exchange of information in accordance with standards set by the Organization for Cooperation and Economic Development, the Swiss government said on Monday.It comes shortly after Switzerland signed a tax deal with France, in which it agreed to share banking information upon request with France’s tax authorities as of Jan. 1, 2010.The Swiss must sign 12 new tax treaties by the end of this year to be removed from the O.E.C.D.’s “gray list” of tax havens. In March, Switzerland agreed to relax its strict bank secrecy rules and embrace tax cooperation norms set by the organization as the G-20 countries began an offensive on tax evasion.The Swiss deal with Britain follows the signing of a deal between Liechtenstein and Britain less than a month ago, which is aimed at encouraging British clients with secret bank accounts to voluntarily disclose billions of pounds of untaxed money.Switzerland has yet to reach an agreement with Germany, which faces a general election later this month and has been one of the most vocal critics of Swiss banking secrecy. Negotiations, however, are set to begin in the coming days.'"
"'09-09-08,'1','The first week of the United States Open revealed what makes men’s tennis so attractive, and it did not involve Rafael Nadal’s slipping out of a sweaty shirt during a changeover. What was exposed was a core strong enough to support the rankings that form the spine of the ATP World Tour.Led by top-ranked Roger Federer, 14 of the top 16 men made it to the round of 16, which begins Monday. That is a high-water mark in the Open era, surpassing the performance of the men in 1992, when 13 of the top players were in the final 16.Only five of the top 16 women survived to play in Week 2, a sure sign that the WTA Tour’s core could use some firming up. The defending champion and second seed, Serena Williams, is the only woman ranked in the top five still in title contention after her sister Venus, the No. 3 seed, lost Sunday to Kim Clijsters. On the men’s side, fifth-ranked Andy Roddick is the only player who is not.When the men square off, the goal, as stated by No. 11 Fernando González, “is to see who can make more winners.” For the women, it seems to be who can make fewer double faults.Clijsters, who is appearing in her third tournament since returning from a two-year layoff, said the depth in the women’s game improved while she was gone. “I think there’s a lot of girls,” she said, adding, “I see them playing out there, and they’re hitting the ball really well and they’re moving good as well. They’re not intimidated by a lot of the top players anymore. I think that’s a big thing.”'"

"'09-09-09,'1','Anthropomorphisms are not inherently odious. They are born of attempts to understand the world, not to subvert it. Our human ancestors would have regularly anthropomorphized in an attempt to explain and predict the behavior of other animals, including those they might want to eat or that might want to eat them. Imagine encountering a strange, bright-eyed jaguar at dusk in the forest, and looking squarely in its eyes looking squarely into yours. At that moment, a little meditation on what you might be thinking ""if you were the jaguar"" would probably be due - and would lead to your hightailing it away from the cat. Humans endured: the attribution was, if not true, at least true enough.Typically, though, we are no longer in the position of needing to imagine the jaguar's desires in time to escape his clutches. Instead we are bringing animals inside and asking them to become members of our families. For that purpose, anthropomorphisms fail to help us incorporate those animals into our homes, and have the smoothest, fullest relationships with them. This is not to say that we're always wrong with our attributions: it might be true that our dog is sad, jealous, inquisitive, depressed - or desiring a peanut butter sandwich for lunch. But we are almost certainly not justified in claiming, say, depression from the evidence before us: the mournful eyes, the loud sigh. Our projections onto animals are often impoverished - or entirely off the mark. We might judge an animal to be happy when we see an upturn of the corners of his mouth; such a ""smile,"" however, can be misleading. On dolphins, the smile is a fixed physiological feature, immutable like the creepily painted face of a clown. Among chimpanzees, a grin is a sign of fear or submission, the furthest thing from happiness. Similarly, a human might raise her eyebrows in surprise, but the eyebrow-raising capuchin monkey is not surprised. He is evincing neither skepticism nor alarm; instead he is signaling to nearby monkeys that he has friendly designs. By contrast, among baboons a raised brow can be a deliberate threat (lesson: be careful which monkey you raise your eyebrows toward). The onus is on us to find a way to confirm or refute these claims we make of animals.It may seem a benign slip from sad eyes to depression, but anthropomorphisms often slide from benign to harmful. Some risk the welfare of the animals under consideration. If we're to put a dog on antidepressants based on our interpretation of his eyes, we had better be pretty sure of our interpretation. When we assume we know what is best for an animal, extrapolating from what is best for us or any person, we may inadvertently be acting at cross-purposes with our aims. For instance, in the last few years there has been considerable to-do made about improved welfare for animals raised for food, such as broiler chickens who have access to the outside, or have room to roam in their pens. Though the end result is the same for the chicken - it winds up as someone's dinner - there is a budding interest in the welfare of the animals before they are killed.But do they want to range freely? Conventional wisdom holds that no one, human or not, likes to be pressed up against others. Anecdotes seem to confirm this: given the choice of a subway car jammed with hot, stressed commuters, and one with only a handful of people, we choose the latter in a second (heeding the possibility, of course, that there's some other explanation - a particularly smelly person, or a glitch in air-conditioning - that explains this favorable distribution). But the natural behavior of chickens may indicate otherwise: chickens flock. They don't sally forth on their own.Biologists devised a simple experiment to test the chickens' preferences of where to be: they picked up individual animals, relocated them randomly within their houses, and monitored what the chickens did next. What they found was that most chickens moved closer to other chickens, not farther away, even when there was open space available. Given the option of space to spread their wings ... they choose the jammed subway car.This is not to say that chickens thus like being smushed against other birds in a cage, or find it a perfectly agreeable life. It is inhumane to pen chickens so tightly they cannot move. But it is to say that assuming resemblance between chicken preferences and our preferences is not the way to insight about what the chicken actually does like. Not coincidentally, these broiler chickens are killed before they reach six weeks of age; domestic chicks are still being brooded by their mothers at that age. Deprived of the ability to run under her wings, the broiler chickens run closer to other chickens.TAKE MY RAINCOAT. PLEASE.Do our anthropomorphic tendencies ever miss so fabulously with dogs? Without a doubt they do. Take raincoats. There are some interesting assumptions involved in the creation and purchase of tiny, stylish, four-armed rain slickers for dogs. Let's put aside the question of whether dogs prefer a bright yellow slicker, a tartan pattern, or a raining-cats-and-dogs motif (clearly they prefer the cats and dogs). Many dog owners who dress their dogs in coats have the best intentions: they have noticed, perhaps, that their dog resists going outside when it rains. It seems reasonable to extrapolate from that observation to the conclusion that he dislikes the rain.He dislikes the rain. What is meant by that? It is that he must dislike getting the rain on his body, the way many of us do. But is that a sound leap? In this case, there is plenty of seeming evidence from the dog himself. Is he excited and wagging when you get the raincoat out? That seems to support the leap ... or, instead, the conclusion that he realizes that the appearance of the coat predicts a long-awaited walk. Does he flee from the coat? Curl his tail under his body and duck his head? Undermines the leap - though does not discredit it outright. Does he look bedraggled when wet? Does he shake the water off excitedly? Neither confirmatory nor disconfirming. The dog is being a little opaque.Here the natural behavior of related, wild canines proves the most informative about what the dog might think about a raincoat. Both dogs and wolves have, clearly, their own coats permanently affixed. One coat is enough: when it rains, wolves may seek shelter, but they do not cover themselves with natural materials. That does not argue for the need for or interest in raincoats. And besides being a jacket, the raincoat is also one distinctive thing: a close, even pressing, covering of the back, chest, and sometimes the head. There are occasions when wolves get pressed upon the back or head: it is when they are being dominated by another wolf, or scolded by an older wolf or relative. Dominants often pin subordinates down by the snout. This is called muzzle biting, and accounts, perhaps, for why muzzled dogs sometimes seem preternaturally subdued. And a dog who ""stands over"" another dog is being dominant. The subordinate dog in that arrangement would feel the pressure of the dominant animal on his body. The raincoat might well reproduce that feeling. So the principal experience of wearing a coat is not the experience of feeling protected from wetness; rather, the coat produces the discomfiting feeling that someone higher ranking than you is nearby.This interpretation is borne out by most dogs' behavior when getting put into a raincoat: they may freeze in place as they are ""dominated."" You might see the same behavior when a dog resisting a bath suddenly stops struggling when he gets fully sodden or covered with a heavy, wet towel. The be-jacketed dog may cooperate in going out, but not because he has shown he likes the coat; it is because he has been subdued. And he will wind up being less wet, but it is we who care about the planning for that, not the dog. The way around this kind of misstep is to replace our anthropomorphizing instinct with a behavior-reading instinct. In most cases, this is simple: we must ask the dog what he wants. You need only know how to translate his answer.Here is our first tool to getting that answer: imagining the point of view of the dog. The scientific study of animals was changed by a German biologist of the early twentieth century named Jakob von Uexküll. What he proposed was revolutionary: anyone who wants to understand the life of an animal must begin by considering what he called their umwelt (OOM-velt): their subjective or ""self-world."" Umwelt captures what life is like as the animal. Consider, for instance, the lowly deer tick. Those of you who have spent long minutes hesitatingly petting the body of a dog for the telltale pinhead that indicates a tick swollen with blood may have already considered the tick. And you probably consider the tick as a pest, period. Barely even an animal. Von Uexküll considered, instead, what it might be like from the tick's point of view.A little background: ticks are parasites. Members of the family arachnid, a class that includes spiders and insects, they have four pairs of legs, a simple body type, and powerful jaws. Thousands of generations of evolution have pared their life to the straightforward: birth, mating, eating, and dying. Born legless and without sex organs, they soon grow these parts, mate, and climb to a high perch - say, a blade of grass. Here's where their tale gets striking. Of all the sights, sounds, and odors of the world, the adult tick is waiting for just one. It is not looking around: ticks are blind. No sound bothers the tick: sounds are irrelevant to its goal. It only awaits the approach of a single smell: a whiff of butyric acid, a fatty acid emitted by warm-blooded creatures (we sometimes smell it in sweat). It might wait here for a day, a month, or a dozen years. But as soon as it smells the odor it is fixed on, it drops from its perch. Then a second sensory ability kicks in. Its skin is photosensitive, and can detect warmth. The tick directs itself toward warmth. If it's lucky, the warm, sweaty smell is an animal, and the tick grasps on and drinks a meal of blood. After feeding once, it drops, lays eggs, and dies.The point of this tale of the tick is that the tick's self-world is different than ours in unimagined ways: what it senses or wants; what its goals are. To the tick, the complexity of persons is reduced to two stimuli: smell and warmth - and it is very intent on those two things. If we want to understand the life of any animal, we need to know what things are meaningful to it. The first way to discover this is to determine what the animal can perceive: what it can see, hear, smell, or otherwise sense. Only objects that are perceived can have meaning to the animal; the rest are not even noticed, or all look the same. The wind that whisks through the grasses? Irrelevant to the tick. The sounds of a childhood birthday party? Doesn't appear on its radar. The delicious cake crumbs on the ground? Leave the tick cold.Second, how does the animal act on the world? The tick mates, waits, drops, and feeds. So the objects of the universe, for the tick, are divided into ticks and non-ticks; things one can or cannot wait upon; surfaces one might or might not drop onto; and substances one may or may not want to feed on.Thus, these two components - perception and action - largely define and circumscribe the world for every living thing. All animals have their own umwelten> - their own subjective realities, what von Uexküll thought of as ""soap bubbles"" with them forever caught in the middle. We humans are enclosed in our own soap bubbles, too. In each of our self-worlds, for instance, we are very attentive to where other people are and what they are doing or saying. (By contrast, imagine the tick's indifference to even our most moving monologues.) We see in the visual range of light, we hear audible noises, and we smell strong odors placed in front of our noses. On top of that each individual creates his own personal umwelt, full of objects with special meaning to him. You can most clearly see this last fact by letting yourself be led through an unknown city by a native. He will steer you along a path obvious to him, but invisible to you. But the two of you share some things: neither of you is likely to stop and listen to the ultrasonic cry of a nearby bat; neither of you smells what the man passing you had for dinner last night (unless it involved a lot of garlic). We, the ticks, and every other animal dovetail into our environment: we are bombarded with stimuli, but only a very few are meaningful to us.The same object, then, will be seen (or, better, sensed - some animals do not see well or at all) by different animals differently. A rose is a rose is a rose. Or is it? To a human a rose is a certain kind of flower, a gift between lovers, and a thing of beauty. To the beetle, a rose is perhaps an entire territory, with places to hide (on the underside of a leaf, invisible to aerial predators), hunt (in the head of the flower where ant nymphs grow), and lay eggs (in the joint of the leaf and stem). To the elephant, it is a thorn barely detectable underfoot.And to the dog, what is a rose? As we'll see, this depends upon the construction of the dog, both in body and brain. As it turns out, to the dog, a rose is neither a thing of beauty nor a world unto itself. A rose is undistinguished from the rest of the plant matter surrounding it - unless it has been urinated upon by another dog, stepped on by another animal, or handled by the dog's owner. Then it gains vivid interest, and becomes far more significant to the dog than even the well-presented rose is to us.'"

"'09-09-09,'1','While at Hunter College, where she earned a bachelor’s degree in 1939, she married Saul Schur, who died in 1988. In addition to her daughter Jane, of Chicago, she is survived by her brother, Philip Zipser of Cranbury, N.J.; two sons, Stephen, of San Francisco, and Jonathan, of Paris; and seven grandchildren. Her second husband, the architect Kaneji Domoto, died in 2002.Mrs. Schur began writing a consumer column for the newspaper P.M., where her officemate, the photographer Weegee, would test his cameras by talking flash pictures of her. She later was a food editor at Seventeen, Look, Flair and Woman’s Home Companion.She bubbled over with ideas, some more successful than others.“I tried to put Jim Beard into a story called ‘The Gourmet Diet,’ ” she told her grandson Jeremy Smith in an oral-history interview in 2001, referring to a proposal for Look. For the article, Beard, a great gourmand, was sent to a hospital for a thorough examination, weighed and put on a strict dietary regimen.“He was O.K. for about a week,” Mrs. Schur said. “Then I get a phone call from him. He said: ‘Sylvia, I’m sorry. I came home last night, and there was a beautiful leg of lamb I’d made in the refrigerator, and I ate it, the whole thing.’ That was the end of the gourmet diet with Jim Beard.”In 1958, after Woman’s Home Companion ceased publication, Mrs. Schur founded Creative Food Services, a company that combined public relations with consulting work for restaurants and food companies.“It just sort of began like spontaneous combustion,” she told her grandson. “People would come to me with things. I had a lot of work to do.”The company was an anomaly at the time. As American women were just beginning to tune into the messages broadcast by Julia Child and Beard and trying to reconcile the gracious-living imperative with the cold reality of convenience foods, Mrs. Schur carved out a profitable niche by providing her services to food manufacturers, the press and home cooks.Companies like General Foods approached her to come up with new products, or new ideas for old ones. Clamato, the highly unlikely combination of clam broth and tomato juice, saw the light of day after Duffy-Mott, one of her early clients, acquired a small business on the Eastern Shore of Maryland that sold packaged clams and bottled clam broth. Cran-Apple helped Ocean Spray extend the cranberry season beyond Thanksgiving and Christmas.In the 1960s her interest in dieting and nutrition — and her private observation that many working women skimped on lunch — led her to do some consulting to help develop Metrecal, a low-calorie but nutritious milkshake that prefigured Slim-Fast.Mrs. Schur’s team of young women, many of them plucked from European cooking schools, worked on recipes to showcase products like Campbell’s soups, or to add fancy touches to staid grocery-store items, like the frozen cube of seasoned butter and flour that expanded in the saucepan to become a sauce for Birds Eye frozen peas.Mrs. Schur wrote many back-of-the-box recipes and cookbooks, often tied to specific products. Some were brochures that could be ordered by sending in the label from a can. Others were more ambitious, like the “The Tappan Creative Cookbook for Microwave Ovens and Ranges,” the “Waring Blender Cook Book” and, for Campbell, “Cooking With Soup.” When Breakstone, a New York dairy, wanted to take its brand national, she wrote “Take a Stick of Butter,” a cookbook that would be dead on arrival today.Creative Food Services, often working with big advertising agencies, provided a point of entry into the American market for foreign foods like Danish blue cheese and New Zealand lamb.Mrs. Schur cultivated close relationships with the press, flooding newspapers around the country with information and recipes that promoted her clients’ products. She became, in effect, a food editor for publications that lacked one. More publicly, in 1978 she became the food editor at Parade Magazine, where her immediate successors were Julia Child and Sheila Lukins, later renowned for her Silver Palate cuisine, who died Aug. 30.Although Mrs. Schur spent most of her time with commercial food products, she was a consultant for Joe Baum and Restaurant Associates and played a pivotal role in developing the menu at the Four Seasons.Mr. Baum was an exacting client, and he laid down the law to Mrs. Schur when he suspected that she might not be able to find sources for the fresh morels listed on the restaurant’s ambitiously seasonal menu. The food writer Mimi Sheraton recalled the meeting in a 1999 article for Vanity Fair: “He glared at her and screamed, ‘If I print morels on that menu, you’d better come up with them, if you have to grow them in your armpits!’ ”She came up with the morels, from a gatherer in Washington State, who harvested a windfall from the deal.Mrs. Schur sold her business in 1990 but continued to offer advice. Her style was pithy. Burger King, keen to help its plate-filling Whopper catch up with McDonald’s Big Mac, once called in Mrs. Schur for a consultation. Breezing into a company boardroom, she proposed a three-word strategy: “Gentlemen, go vertical.”'"
"'09-09-09,'1','Moscow on Tuesday denied news reports that a cargo ship that had been missing in the Atlantic for almost a month was carrying a Russian air-defense system to Iran that was detected by Israel. Russia’s foreign minister dismissed the reports and said that the circumstances of the ship’s disappearance would become clear in due course. The ship, the Maltese-registered Arctic Sea, was officially carrying timber from Finland to Algeria when it was boarded on July 24 by a group of eight men. They were charged with kidnapping and piracy after the Arctic Sea was intercepted by Russian warships off Cape Verde. News reports over the weekend, citing military sources in Israel and Russia, said the Arctic Sea had been loaded with S-300 missiles at the Kaliningrad naval port without the Kremlin’s knowledge.'"
"'09-09-09,'1','Such disputes are an extension of a longstanding source of tension — sometimes light, other times more antagonistic — between drivers and their self-appointed watchdogs.It’s just that now, the back-seat driver is going after the BlackBerry.These critics say such devices not only put lives at risk, but also steal attention from passengers hoping for some quality catch-up time. The multitaskers counter with the view that they must, and like, to tend to social and work demands.Safety advocates who favor outlawing multitasking behind the wheel say the new generation of back-seat hawks may be playing a crucial role in changing the culture — much as they did in helping enforce seat belt laws — in a way these advocates say laws alone may not be able to.In a survey conducted this year of 2,501 people, the AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety found that 48 percent of people worry about a friend or family member driving unsafely. Of those people, 19 percent said the cause of their concern was multitasking behind the wheel.Some drivers say that the second-guessing is unnecessary because of their ability to handle driving and other tasks.“I barely even look at my phone when I text,” said Sarah Edwards, 29, a customer service representative in .Her close friend, Amy Macauley, 32, isn’t convinced. “We’ve talked about this,” Ms. Macauley said. “I’ve cited vague statistics about how dangerous it is, but she doesn’t pay attention.”She brings a particular sensitivity to the discussion. Her sister and the husband of a close friend died from crash injuries, and her brother-in-law was seriously injured in a car accident.“I know things can change in an instant when someone is behind the wheel,” Ms. Macauley said. To her, talking on the phone or texting while driving, unless it’s an emergency, is “completely gross.”People like Ms. Macauley are finding more ammunition to argue their side.Studies show that people who talk on the phone while driving face four times as great a crash risk as those who do not. The risk is considerably higher for motorists who text.The federal government estimates that at any given time about 11 percent of drivers, or about two million people, are talking on a cellphone.Many of them are most likely doing so alone. Up to 85 percent of drivers have no passenger with them in the car, estimates the Transportation Institute.But when an adult passenger is present, the Transportation Institute found, he or she can enhance safety — and reduce crash risk by up to 50 percent — by keeping eyes on the road, or encouraging safer behavior.That means that a friend or family member cajoling a motorist to put down the phone can provide a safety advantage, as long as the disagreement itself doesn’t escalate to the point of distraction.For all the evidence about the dangers of distracted driving, multitaskers say there are powerful forces — both social and economic — that make it hard to put their devices down.A 2008 poll taken by Nationwide Insurance of 1,500 motorists found that 48 percent of people who multitasked behind the wheel did so because they felt an urgent need to address an issue pertaining to school or work; 33 percent said they felt pressure to stay connected socially.That pressure may affect some people more than others. An emerging body of science suggests that there are some people who are more likely to be drawn to multitasking — behind the wheel or otherwise — because of the way their brains are wired.Clifford Nass, a co-director of an automotive research laboratory at , said some researchers had labeled such heavy multitaskers as “explorers” because they enjoyed the constant hunt for information — whether it pertained to work, entertainment or social life.Vic Gideon, 48, a hospital executive from Cleveland, says he feels the call of his device for social and work purposes, even when behind the wheel and even when his family, including his four children, are in the car.“Even if I’m going 60 miles an hour, I feel the need to check it,” said Mr. Gideon, referring to his phone. “It might be spam, a wrong number, whatever. But who cares? My cell vibrates. I respond.”Mr. Gideon said it had created tension. “My wife tells me I don’t know how to drive,” he said. “And then, of course, not only do I not know how to drive, but I don’t know how to drive safely. I believe I’m being careful.”The Nationwide Insurance poll found that both men and women were avid multitaskers. About 85 percent of female drivers said they multitasked, compared with 78 percent of male drivers.Grace Andrews, 49, a corporate consultant in Melrose, Mass., is the one taking heat in her family. Her husband, Joe Nardone, 44, and her son, Colby Andrews, 12, despise her incessant use of the phone.“I honestly do laugh at myself all the time,” says Ms. Andrews. “Is it really possible that I am talking on the phone, e-mailing and driving with my knees simultaneously?”Her husband and son tell her she cares more about the phone than about them, and that she puts herself and others at risk.“I could never imagine that we would get to this stage — that this is the stuff we would fight about,” she said.'"
"'09-09-09,'1','In the boom years, schools could survive because of reputation and in spite of flawed financial planning and a lack of proper management, Mr. McEwen said. St. David’s trustees, for example, lacked a sense of urgency and ignored the school’s financial problems for too long, said Mr. McEwen, whose company considered acquiring the school earlier this year but could not reach an agreement. The school’s administration did not return calls seeking comment.Mr. Hogan, who was a member of the school’s parents’ association, remembered how C. Hoare and Company, a small British private bank, asked St. David’s to repay a loan of about $2.5 million shortly after the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008. While the trustees scrambled to come up with the money, trying unsuccessfully to sell part of the school’s land to raise money, some parents set out to find new schools for their daughters, further complicating the financial picture.“In the past, such schools would go to the banks to survive, but now with the credit crunch there’s no other place to go to,” Mr. McEwen said. “Now banks rather don’t lend than risk the reputational damage when they would have to close down a school.”At the Bolitho School in Penzance, Cornwall, parents dug deep into their own pockets when HBOS, the troubled British lender that merged with Lloyds last year, called in an overdraft two days before Christmas. To keep the school with 336 boys and girls open, parents raised $825,000 among themselves that they lent to the school for five years at a 5 percent interest rate. St. Catherine’s Preparatory School in Cheshire was less fortunate, closing in December, while Wentworth College in Bournemouth announced in March that it would merge with another school. Some private schools have been forced to reduce their staffs or delay building restoration work.Many private schools are run as charities, and these now face the additional worry of new rules from the government’s Charity Commission requiring all charities to prove that they are making a substantial contribution to society or risk losing their charitable status and the tax breaks that go with it.For independent schools, this means offering student grants, making their facilities available to the community or teaming up with state schools on some projects. The commission does not expect the rules to threaten the survival of any school, but some industry experts voiced concern, and two schools have already been told they need to do more.“This could not have come at a worse time for schools,” Mrs. Fieldman said. “They not only have to get their finances together for themselves but now also for the commission. For some smaller schools this could really be the last nail in the coffin.”Christopher A. Woodhead, chairman of Cognita, a group of 45 British schools, and a former chief inspector of schools, said he had no doubt that “private education will continue to flourish” in Britain despite the recession, but he predicted more consolidation. Cognita reports a growing number of contacts from independent schools that are interested in joining the group.Mr. Woodhead said that if nothing else, the recession should prompt those schools anxious about their future to act now. “Debt grows too big and they hemorrhage students,” he said. “Many leave it too late.”As for Freya Hogan, the former St. David’s student, she is now attending Sir William Perkins’s School, another independent school for girls but larger and farther from her home. Instead of walking to school, she now has to take a train, doubling her commute to half an hour.“She’s very upset,” Mr. Hogan said. “But she was lucky. She already knows some girls there.”'"

Mr. Gurney’s remembrance of this event provides the basis of his new play, “The Grand Manner,” which Lincoln Center Theater said on Tuesday it would present as part of its spring season.

"'09-09-09,'1','Serena Williams, the second seed and defending champion, earned a date in the semifinals with Clijsters after a 6-4, 6-3 victory over 10th-seeded Flavia Pennetta on Tuesday night, with Venus cheering from her box at Arthur Ashe Stadium.Upon winning the entertaining match, Williams dropped her racket and held up both fists in emphatic celebration, then looked forward to facing Clijsters, the popular Belgian.“She’s such a great person and I only wish the best for her,” Williams said in an on-court interview, “although not in the next match.”Later, when discussing the idea of seeking revenge against someone who had beaten her sister, an interviewer noted that Williams did not seem to hold any animosity toward Clijsters.According to research by the WTA, only once in three opportunities has Williams beaten an opponent in a major tournament after that player had beaten her sister. It happened in 1999 when she defeated Martina Hingis in the United States Open final after Hingis had beaten Venus in the semifinals.Pennetta, who forced Williams to play her best in order to win in two sets, said Clijsters would have to be in her best form to win the semifinal.“For me, Serena and Venus are the best ones,” Pennetta said. “When they are in shape and when they are like, fit, they are the No. 1.”Clijsters has beaten Williams only once in eight career meetings, but they have not played since 2003. Still, Clijsters is well aware of the game and the attitude that Williams brings to tennis’s biggest stages.“She’s always been able to step it up at the Grand Slams,” Clijsters said. “I’ve seen her play here, and she has that face where she’s like, O.K., I’m here to do business.“But that doesn’t mean that you don’t get chances when you play her.”The matchup turns the spotlight back on the life of Clijsters, the former No. 1 player who walked away from the sport in 2007 after battling injuries. She wanted to start a family, and she and her husband, Brian Lynch, now tote around their 18-month-old daughter, Jada.Clijsters’s return to tennis has gone better than anyone could have expected. In three tournaments, she has beaten Venus Williams (No. 3), Marion Bartoli (14) twice, Victoria Azarenka (9) and Svetlana Kuznetsova (6), re-establishing herself quickly on the tour’s top level and playing so well that at times it seems as if she never left.Clijsters, who said she watched little tennis while immersing herself in family life, said the game had changed in her absence, not entirely for the better.“A lot of the young girls coming up have a very similar type of game,” she said. “They hit the ball very hard from the baseline, but I don’t see them having a backup plan when things aren’t going well. I don’t feel they have the ability to mix their game up when their game isn’t working.”That assessment applied to Li, even though she could hardly be considered a young player: she is a year older than the 26-year-old Clijsters.Clijsters was overpowering in the first set, pouncing on Li’s abundant errors and rolling through the set in 25 minutes. The second set was more competitive, but Li did not have the variety in her game to throw Clijsters off hers.Clijsters has said that having her daughter around has balanced her life and put tennis in perspective. She may need that perspective to handle the flood of attention that will come with her trip to the semifinals.“I feel I can still compete with the girls at the top,” Clijsters said. “And that’s what I’m going to try to do.”'"
"'09-09-09,'1','SAN FRANCISCO — The San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge reopened shortly before 7 a.m. Tuesday, despite predictions that it would take until Wednesday to repair a cracked support.“Drivers are honking and giving thumbs up,” read the bridge’s Twitter feed as the first cars made their way across since the bridge was closed Thursday night to allow work crews onto the eastern span.A 250-ton chunk of the bridge’s eastern span collapsed in the Loma Prieta earthquake in 1989, and a more seismically sound rebuilt span is scheduled to open in 2013.Over the weekend, work crews replaced a 300-foot section of the eastern span with a detour. That work was completed on schedule, but during an inspection, engineers found a crack in a steel link known as an eyebar. Bridge officials announced that a repair was necessary and that the bridge, which had been set to reopen at 5 a.m. Tuesday, would have to be closed for an additional day.The crack was not a result of the weekend’s detour work and was thought to have occurred sometime after the last inspection in 2007, officials said.'"
"'09-09-09,'1','For 21 years, the University of Washington School of Medicine has dispatched its rising second-year students across the Northwest to provide primary care in rural or underserved areas. The monthlong program is elective, but a record number of students took part this year — 117 from a class of 216.The school has a cooperative agreement to train medical students from Alaska, Idaho, Montana and Wyoming, none of which has a medical college of its own. The summer program is one of several vehicles, along with loan forgiveness enticements, designed to lure students back to their home states to practice in areas with a shortage of primary care givers.This year, the students set out as negotiations were intensifying in Washington over wholesale changes to the health care system they will soon be joining. Whether there will be improvements to the system remains to be seen, but few students returned thinking there was little to fix.Payment policies that leave primary care providers struggling to cover their costs have pushed family practitioners and internists into early retirement, and discouraged newly minted doctors from replacing them. To make a living, and chip away at immense educational debt, general practitioners often find they must churn patients and work long, unsatisfying hours.The result is that only a third of today’s graduates of American medical schools train in internal or family medicine, the two largest primary care disciplines, compared with nearly half only 25 years ago, according to the National Resident Matching Program, which matches medical school graduates with residency openings. The figure at the University of Washington, despite a persistent emphasis on primary care, is only slightly higher.For some students, like Mr. Opfer, 23, their summer experience persuaded them that primary care was not for them. The three pediatricians Mr. Opfer followed, who ran the only children’s clinic in Gillette, filled their 13-hour days with hospital rounds and staccato five-minute appointments, he said. One was about to retire because of burnout.Mr. Opfer said he thought that the lifestyle would be too harsh to raise a family, and that it would take many years to pay off his anticipated medical school debt of at least $120,000.“I don’t think you can practice optimal medicine,” Mr. Opfer said. “There is too little incentive after going through all this education and being in school for the majority of your life to want to pursue a career just in primary care.”Other students, like Kylie G. Boggess, 24, witnessed how integral a federally qualified health center could be to a community like Nampa, Idaho, and became all the more committed. “This just sold it to me,” Ms. Boggess said. “You get to have a very personal relationship with your patients. You get to know them.”Nonetheless, Ms. Boggess, who is from Twin Falls, Idaho, said she had been struck by how much time was devoted to scavenging resources for patients who had little money.“I would really like to practice in a world where I can just take care of my patients and that’s the end of it,” she said, “where the big elephant in the room is not whether or not my recommendations mean anything because of cost.”Mr. Olsgaard, 28, also found that money drove medical decisions at the community health center where he worked. “You know the patient, you know the patient’s financial information, and then you make clinical decisions based on that,” he said.Ben J. Ruffatto, 26, said that after working with a family practitioner in Dillon, Mont., he had become convinced that rationing health care was “a socioeconomic national cultural inevitability.”“It is right now,” Mr. Ruffatto said. “There simply isn’t enough money in the system for everyone to get absolutely everything that they want.”There were differing opinions among the students about critical components of the plans being discussed by President Obama and Congress, like whether health coverage should be mandated and whether the government should create a public insurance option. But even those favoring the Democratic approach said they felt momentum had stalled.“I really like Obama, but I’m a little bummed,” Ms. Boggess said. “He has yet to really strongly make the moral argument for providing health care to our citizens.”Some, like Elizabeth M. Stuhlmiller, 25, who worked in a clinic in Tonasket, Wash., said they had not paid much attention to the debate, but had learned this summer to take satisfaction in improving the country’s health one patient at a time.“I think I can fill a hole; I think that there’s a big need,” said Ms. Stuhlmiller, who plans to pursue primary care. “I don’t necessarily have the goals of changing a system. To feel at the end of the day that I’ve treated a patient and helped them, that would be enough for me.”'"
"'09-09-09,'1','Serena Williams, the second seed and defending champion, earned a date in the semifinals with Clijsters after a 6-4, 6-3 victory over 10th-seeded Flavia Pennetta on Tuesday night, with Venus cheering from her box at Arthur Ashe Stadium.Upon winning the entertaining match, Williams dropped her racket and held up both fists in emphatic celebration, then looked forward to facing Clijsters, the popular Belgian.“She’s such a great person and I only wish the best for her,” Williams said in an on-court interview, “although not in the next match.”Later, when discussing the idea of seeking revenge against someone who had beaten her sister, an interviewer noted that Williams did not seem to hold any animosity toward Clijsters.According to research by the WTA, only once in three opportunities has Williams beaten an opponent in a major tournament after that player had beaten her sister. It happened in 1999 when she defeated Martina Hingis in the United States Open final after Hingis had beaten Venus in the semifinals.Pennetta, who forced Williams to play her best in order to win in two sets, said Clijsters would have to be in her best form to win the semifinal.“For me, Serena and Venus are the best ones,” Pennetta said. “When they are in shape and when they are like, fit, they are the No. 1.”Clijsters has beaten Williams only once in eight career meetings, but they have not played since 2003.

"'09-09-10,'1','Serena Williams flicked Flavia Pennetta off like an errant insect in the quarter-final round of the U.S. Open on Tuesday, and despite having played an elegant defensive game, the seasoned Italian player was immediately dispatched from the promo-loop that is television coverage of tennis, and also from memory. Yet in one way the 27-year-old Pennetta (ranked 10th in singles this year) managed to leave an impression, and that was as one of the rare athletes who knows how to dress.There was a time when athletes had a style advantage over people who do not wear a uniform on the job. Their working wardrobes were essentially chosen for them and largely based on either protocol or function or both. As a consequence, athletes were often the best dressed people around. It is well known that American fashion owes its origins to the marriage of form and function epitomized by true sportswear.Rare is the designer who didn’t swipe cues from what athletes wore on the field. Claire McCardell adapted the jaunty ease of clothes worn by golfers like the great Olympian Babe Didrikson Zaharias and translated it into uniforms for working women. Geoffrey Beene made a famous sequined evening dress numbered like a football jersey. Ralph Lauren built a multibillion-dollar empire making commercial adaptations of the costumes favored by the players of the so-called gentleman sports: polo, fox hunting and tennis, of course.Now a sponsor of the U.S. Open, Polo Ralph Lauren provides uniforms for nearly everyone involved with play at the Arthur Ashe stadium except the players themselves. True, one could gripe that Mr. Lauren scaled his polo player logo up to kiddie-cartoon size. But it’s also true that, at this point, the linesmen wearing Polo clothing are about the best-dressed people on court.The players themselves tend to dress like clowns.It’s probably pointless to argue in favor of tennis whites anymore, rarely seen outside of Wimbledon. That the innate elegance of the individual’s game was underscored by a uniform that did not erase personality so much as concentrate it in the specific dynamics of movement is not really open to question.'"

"'09-09-10,'1','But it now has a microphone. And a speaker. And an FM radio. And a voice recorder. And a pedometer that counts how many steps you walk or run. And a camcorder.It sounds like a lot to cram onto a (slightly larger) 2.2-inch screen. I've taken it for an 18-hour spin, and this is how it works.* The video. Yes, on the back of the new Nano, there's a tiny lens right and a microphone the size of a pinhole. If this isn't the smallest camcorder in the world, I don't know what is.The video quality turns out to be exactly like the iPhone's: nowhere near as good as a camcorder's video, but better than a typical cellphone's. You can see some sample footage on Apple's demo page (http://bit.ly/twihG). Keep in mind, of course, that (a) Apple's samples are all shot in bright sunlight, and (b) they appear on Apple's page smaller than they really are, which makes them look sharper.You can record for 8 or 16 hours on this little thing. There are 15 video effects you can add for fun (Black and White, X-Ray, Thermal, Security Cam, Cyborg, and so on). You ache for an image stabilizer--this wisp of metal truly isn't an ideal shape for holding steady. In fact, filming with it feels awkward in general, at least at first.The sound is crisp but mono; the video is only standard definition. The Nano does not shoot still photos; Apple says that kind of sensor wouldn't fit in a case this small.I want to whine about these things, I really do. But you know what? You've got video in a machine that can hide between two fingers, for Pete's sake. There's something to be said about having a video recorder in a gadget that's so small, you always have it with you. What good is hi-def if you didn't have the camcorder when the moment arose?Also, don't be surprised if this thing triggers a whole social wave of spy-filming. It's totally easy to conceal.* FM radio. Apple is years late to this party, but radio is nice to have. As on the Zune and other players, the headphone cord is the FM antenna.But on the Nano, you can pause live radio for up to 15 minutes; when you hit Play after your phone call, the show continues right from where you paused it. Pretty neat.There's also song tagging: when you hear a song you like, you can hold down the center button to flag it. Later, it will show up in iTunes so you can research or buy that song.At least in theory. Unfortunately, radio stations have to transmit a special iTunes tag to make this work. So far, Apple says, ClearChannel stations are broadcasting that signal, but that it will be some time before the rest of the world is on board.* Pedometer. The pedometer counts your steps; it's meant to be a fitness tool.It's a lot more elaborate than it sounds at first: you can set step goals for yourself, track calories burned, display workout start and stop times, and calculate totals for the week or the month. Turn the Nano 90 degrees, and you get bar graphs. You can even upload your workout data to the iPod+Nike Web site (without having to buy anything), for further analysis, competition against other people, and so on.It's great for geeks who work out, if there is such a thing.* Voice recorder. More spy fun. Each recorded audio chunk can be two hours long, although the iPod automatically begins a new chunk if your session rolls on longer.* Speaker. It's not much of a speaker; you can't even hear it in a plane or a car. But it's good enough for reviewing videos when there's not such a roar, or for listening to some lo-fi background music when you can't find your earbuds. (Yeah, I forgot to mention: the Nano is also a music player.)The Nano costs $150 for the 8-gig model, which holds 2,000 songs or 8 hours of video. The 16-gig model holds twice as much for $180. The battery is rated at 24 hours of audio playback. The Nano is compatible with all those iPod accessories: car adapters, alarm clocks, cases.If you're Mr. Spock, free of emotions, unmoved by style or looks, then you've got a tough decision. You can easily find players that cost less (at least in the 8-gig category), like Microsoft's Zune ($100) or Creative Labs' Zen Mosaic ($80).You get an FM radio and maybe a voice recorder. But you'll lose the camcorder, speaker, pedometer, stopwatch, alarm clock, volume limiter, calendar, address book, note pad or external-hard-drive mode. And the puniness of the accessories catalog is not an insubstantial point.But let's not kid ourselves. Real, non-Vulcan consumers do, in fact, care about looks and refinement. Apple says that it's sold 100 million Nanos so far, in its various iterations; now that it's sprouted a feature list as long as your arm, the Nano's popularity is in no danger.Guess we'll have to wait until the next iPod cycle for all those features to come to the iPod Touch. Of course, by then, we'll all be playing the Beatles on our tablets.'"

"'09-09-10,'1','The report gave its highest grade, a B, to Merck, for producing Isentress, the first of a new class of AIDS drugs called integrase inhibitors. It also praised Merck for freezing prices for lower income users. Isentress, approved in 2007, is already used by 11 percent of the more than 550,000 people treated in the United States, Michael S. Seggev, a spokesman for Merck, said Wednesday.“We’re very pleased to have achieved the highest grade on the report card,” he said. “They’re the most respected and most representative coalition of H.I.V. community groups in the U.S., so their opinion is very meaningful.”The group gave an F to Abbott for raising the wholesale price of Norvir, the first drug proved to increase survival in AIDS patients, by 400 percent in 2003. Norvir is a key ingredient in most AIDS treatment cocktails. The price increaes provoked an outcry by many patients and others.An Abbott spokesman, Dirk van Eeden, responded Wednesday, “The H.I.V. community is an important stakeholder for us, so yes, we do take notice of the comments they make.” He added, “We really believe we’ve discovered important medicines and played our part in making sure the patients who need it can get it.”Other grades included a B for Tibotec Pharmaceuticals, owned by Johnson and Johnson as a separate company focusing on infectious diseases; C-plus for Pfizer, which announced in April a joint venture with GlaxoSmithKline to spin off a company focused on H.I.V.; C-plus for Gilead Sciences; C-minus grades for Bristol-Myers Squibb and GlaxoSmithKline, both criticized for high prices; a D-plus for Boehringer Ingelheim; and a D for Hoffman LaRoche, which the coalition said has the most expensive drug on the market.Representatives for Pfizer, Gilead and Boehringer responded Wednesday that they valued the group’s opinion and continued their work in AIDS. Bristol-Myers Squibb and GlaxoSmithKline officials each said they were “disappointed” and deserved better grades. Other companies did not respond immediately to requests for comment.The coalition was to some degree biting the hand that feeds it. It receives all of its financing from drug companies, mostly for activists to travel to meetings with them. The executive director, Edward T. Rewolinski, disclosed specific amounts to The New York Times for the last two years. “None of our members has the wherewithal to afford this activity,” he said.“People like that would never be influenced by the flow of money,” Jennifer Flynn, managing director of an unrelated AIDS group, Health GAP, in New York, said.The top fund provider was Gilead with $100,000, followed by Pfizer, $63,000; Bristol-Myers Squibb, $50,000; Tibotec, $45,000; Merck, $15,000; and Boehringer, $5,000. Abbott gave no money.Mr. Huff said the grading group was insulated from financing requests. “There’s no sugarcoating,” he said. “The membership feels that the pharmaceutical industry can be doing a much better job, whether it’s innovation or pricing.”The coalition was formed in 2001 partly to coordinate contacts with drug companies instead of letting the industry decide whom to invite to meetings.'"
"'09-09-10,'1','Diebold announced last week that it has sold its United States voting machine division to its main rival, Election Systems & Software.Given Diebold’s troubling record, it is hard to lament its departure from American elections, but this sale could make a bad situation worse. Regulators should take a hard look at the anticompetitive implications. And Congress, the states and cities need to push a lot harder for fundamental reforms in the voting machine business and the way Americans vote.Diebold has long been the company that critics of electronic voting love to hate. The company has been accused of illegally installing uncertified software and of making machines that, at least sometimes, drop votes. The company raised serious doubts about its objectivity when Diebold’s then-chief executive wrote a fund-raising letter expressing his dedication to delivering Ohio for President George W. Bush in 2004. Ohio, of course, was one of the states using Diebold voting machines.The combination of the Election Systems & Software and Diebold American voting machine divisions raises classic antitrust concerns. Election Systems & Software, which has also been criticized for making unreliable machines, would be the nation’s largest voting machine maker by far. And states and cities, which have long complained about the low quality and high cost of the machines, would have less choice or bargaining power.Government at all levels must do more to promote competition. It is important that machines are certified for use only after they pass rigorous testing. But the current state certification processes are so expensive and drawn-out that they are a significant barrier to entry.More fundamentally, Congress, the states and cities should look for ways to have governments own and manage their voting machines, as the reform group FairVote has advocated. It makes no sense to allow private companies to count votes using secret, proprietary software. The federal government and the states should also require that all electronic voting machines produce a paper record of every vote and mandate random hand counts to ensure the reliability of the results.'"
"'09-09-10,'1','“For the moment they are in the sweet spot in terms of prices,” said Bhushan Bahree, an analyst at IHS Energy Research Associates. “Both the producers and the consumers are content. Nobody is complaining.”In December, after the financial markets tumbled, oil fell as low as $33 a barrel, and producers feared that a prolonged period of low prices would follow. ’s producers have since stuck to a rigorous playbook: cut supplies, maintain discipline and hope that a global recovery will push demand back up again.OPEC’s strategy worked. Producers managed to prop up prices again; they have gained about 60 percent this year. Oil prices in New York rose 21 cents, to $71.31, ahead of the meeting.The strategy has been spearheaded by , the country with the biggest production capacity.Taking the lead at OPEC’s gathering here, Saudi Arabia said that it saw no need to cut production at this time and risk jeopardizing the economic recovery. OPEC decided to keep its output level unchanged, stressing “the downside risks associated with the extremely fragile recovery,” the cartel said in a statement released after the late-night session.“At $70 or $80 a barrel, this is the right price for all consumers and producers,” said Abdalla al-Attiyeh, the energy minister for . “I believe this price will help strengthen the world economy. It will help.”Earlier this year, Saudi Arabia said it considered $75 a barrel to be a fair price. Speaking about the current price of oil, , the Saudi oil minister, told reporters Wednesday, “We are happy where it is and it’s going to be there for a while. We don’t have the slightest worry.”For consumers, lower oil prices would be a mixed blessing. They would lead to lower gasoline prices, but they would also risk putting into question investments in alternative fuels and renewable power that the Obama administration and the are encouraging.Instead, Western petroleum executives say they want prices to stay high so they can keep investing in unconventional sources of oil in places like the or the deep offshore, and to forestall a potential shortfall in supply. As a result, few have called on OPEC to add to the supply to bring down prices.Unleaded regular gasoline currently sells at an average $2.57 a gallon in the , according to AAA.In Vienna, many delegates know the current situation might not last long.As the recovery starts to take shape, there is still considerable uncertainty about the direction of oil prices. Over the summer, commodity and equity markets rose as investors bet on a faster recovery. But some analysts warn that the present equilibrium is built on shaky grounds.“The explanation of $65 to $75 a barrel has nothing to do with oil but with the expectation that the global economy rebounds,” said Edward L. Morse, the head of economic research at LCM Commodities in New York. “The risk is that the wind goes out of the sails of commodities and equities, and a sell-off could bring oil prices below $60 a barrel.”Mr. Morse points out that oil markets are currently bound by two powerful bookends. On one hand, the appetite of investors for commodities, including oil, remains strong, and could prevent prices from falling too much.On the other hand, OPEC’s members currently hold spare capacity of at least six million barrels a day, a level not seen since the late 1990s. Most of that is in Saudi Arabia, and the rest is shared among , the and a few other countries.That high level of spare capacity, which can be brought on line rapidly if demand rises, gives Saudi Arabia plenty of clout within OPEC.One factor OPEC is counting on is that demand for oil will eventually pick up as the economy recovers. According to a report by IHS Cambridge Energy Research Associates, global oil demand is expected to grow next year for the first time in two years, by 900,000 barrels a day, and eventually return to its 2007 level of 86.5 million barrels a day by 2012.“Economic growth is the name of the game,” said Mr. Naimi, the Saudi oil minister, who was driving a new Mercedes hybrid while here.On Thursday, the International Energy Agency raised its global oildemand forecast for both 2009 and 2010 by nearly half a millionbarrels per day, citing ‘‘stronger than expected data’’ from NorthAmerica and developing Asia. The agency now expects global demand of84.4 million barrels per day this year, and 85.7 million barrels perday in 2010.Nonetheless, it said, demand from the developed world ‘‘is poised toremain weak for the remainder of this year,’’ and it warned thatChina’s purchases to build its oil reserves might be distorting thepicture of developing world demand.One topic to be discussed by OPEC was how well its members were complying with their quotas. With prices rising, the group’s discipline has frayed in recent months. Some producers, like Angola, have been pumping more oil than promised. Bringing everyone back in line could prove contentious, analysts said.Over the last year, OPEC had agreed to reduce its production by 4.2 million barrels a day. Compliance with that target has reached 80 percent, analysts said, but OPEC delegates said producers were now abiding with only around 70 percent of the agreed cuts.'"
"'09-09-10,'1','Legislators demanded to know why an accused serial killer’s DNA sample never made it to crime analysts and what state police and prison officials are doing to make sure swabs from other convicts make it to the laboratory. The police arrested the suspect, Walter Ellis, on Saturday after they obtained DNA from his toothbrush that they claim ties him to a string of cold-case homicides in Milwaukee from 1986 to 2007. He is being held on $1 million bond on two counts of first-degree intentional homicide. Police Chief Ed Flynn of Milwaukee has suggested that if investigators had Mr. Ellis’s DNA profile sooner they might have identified him and prevented at least one death.'"
"'09-09-10,'1','There is no evidence to date that humans who hunt, kill and eat deer have developed chronic wasting disease. Nor does the prion that causes it pass naturally to other animal species in the wild.Besides mad cow and chronic wasting disease, the prion diseases include Creutzfeldt-Jakob, which leads to dementia and death in humans. Each of these diseases is caused by a different strain, and all strains behave somewhat differently.In the case of chronic wasting disease, “it turns out prions exploit the oldest trick in the book used by pathogens and parasites,” said Mike Miller, a veterinarian at the Colorado Division of Wildlife who is an expert on chronic wasting disease.Each deer excretes about two pounds of fecal pellets a day. As wild herds move around, or captive herds are trucked between states, more soil becomes infected.In captive herds, up to 90 percent of animals develop the disease, Dr. Prusiner said. In wild herds, a third of animals can be infected.“This is an important finding,” said Judd M. Aiken, a leading prion expert who is director of the Alberta Veterinary Research Institute in Canada and who was not involved in the new study. “Most of us suspected that prions might be spread in feces, but we needed proof.”“The fact that prions are shed at a preclinical stage of the disease is very significant,” Dr. Aiken added.The study was carried out in two parts. First, Dr. Miller and his team infected five mule deer by feeding them brain tissue from an infected animal. They took fecal samples before infection and at three to six months afterward. The deer came down with chronic wasting disease 16 to 20 months later.Four to nine months after infection, the deer began shedding prions in low levels in their feces, even though they had no symptoms. Surprisingly, an infected deer could shed as many prions at this stage as would accumulate in its brain during terminal disease.In the second part of the experiment, Erdem Tamguney, an assistant professor at Dr. Prusiner’s institute, created a strain of mice with deerlike prions in their brains.When Dr. Tamguney inoculated the brains of these mice with feces from infected but asymptomatic deer, half developed symptoms of chronic wasting disease. Fourteen out of 15 fecal samples transmitted the disease to some of the mice.Dr. Aiken said prions tended to bind to clay in soil and to persist indefinitely. When deer graze on infected dirt, prions that are tightly bound to clay will persist for long periods in their intestinal regions. So there is no chance chronic wasting disease will be eradicated, he said. Outside the laboratory, nothing can inactivate prions bound to soil. They are also impervious to radiation.'"

"'09-09-10,'1','The last time Federer didn’t make it to a semifinal at a Grand Slam was the 2004 French Open when, as the No. 1 seed, he was upset by Gustavo Kuerten in the third round.And for a while Wednesday night, Federer was in danger of suffering an even greater upset at the hands of Soderling, who is now 0-12 against Federer, a record that includes a loss in the French Open final and in the fourth round at Wimbledon in July.This time Soderling was within two points of losing in straight sets before he ramped up his game, and his serve, and forced Federer to save a set point in the fourth-set tie breaker.After breezing through the first two sets, Federer suddenly looked tentative and vulnerable against Soderling’s thundering serves and daring passing shots.With the fans starting to throw their support behind Soderling, Federer led by 5-2 in the third-set tie breaker, only two points from winning the match in less than two hours. At that point Soderling surged back and took the set.In the fourth set the players remained on serve again, with Federer serving brilliantly when he needed it. Federer was never broken the whole match, allowing Soderling just a peak at five break points. Federer never broke Soderling in the last two sets.The fourth-set tie breaker also started evenly, with the players splitting the first six points, but what happened next sent a jolt of electricity through the chilled crowd.With Federer trailing, 3-4, the players traded four consecutive aces, and then Soderling hit a bold service winner up the middle to take a 6-5 lead.But Federer saved the critical point and then set up a match point when Soderling’s backhand down the line went wide. Finally, Soderling hit another forehand wide, brining an end to a dangerous test for Federer.Now Federer, who is seeking his sixth consecutive Open title, will face Novak Djokovic in the semifinals for the second consecutive year. Djokovic, the No. 4 seed, rebounded after dropping the second set Wednesday afternoon to oust No. 10 Fernando Verdasco, 7-6 (2), 1-6, 7-5, 6-2.Djokovic, who is in the semifinals for the third straight year, spent the season struggling to keep himself in the conversation with the top players in the world and made a big stride toward doing that Wednesday.He has made clear his desire to win the Open and become more than a footnote to the rivalry that dominates men’s tennis, between Federer and Rafael Nadal. And Djokovic admitted he has made a concerted effort to change the negativity that rained on him last year, when he criticized Andy Roddick in an on-court interview.The crowd turned on him in a New York minute, and Djokovic seemed to grow more surly from the experience. This year, he has worked on his image, and his temper.He hired Todd Martin, the serious-minded former American professional, who has helped him with his serve and his confidence. And he has invited children of the victims of the Sept. 11 attacks to his matches. “It’s a gesture that I hope has meaning for them,” he said, adding that his own heritage has made him familiar with war.“Obviously, we don’t want to talk about the past and what happened,” he said.In his tennis game, he may reach back to recapture the good feelings from his 2007 run, but he is only looking forward now.Djokovic needed more than three hours to advance, and he could not relax until the fourth set, when Verdasco fell apart in a heap of errors.Early, it looked as if that fate might befall Djokovic, but he captured a back-and-forth first set by getting hot during the tie breaker while Verdasco struggled with unforced errors.But Verdasco found some momentum early in the second set, breaking Djokovic and starting to pound his forehand harder, which drove Djokovic deeper in the court and kept him from dictating the points. Djokovic grew frustrated and his footwork broke down. He lost his serve three times as Verdasco cruised through the set.But Djokovic found some traction in the third set, mostly by cranking up his first serve, and it was Verdasco’s turn to struggle with some ghastly errors. Serving at 5-5, Verdasco botched a volley into a wide-open court and hit it long to fall behind by 15-40, and he swiped the net with his racket in frustration. He fought back to deuce, but Djokovic earned the break when Verdasco sprayed a forehand wide of the court on another break point. Djokovic served out to win the third set.He carried that play into the fourth set, when Verdasco also began struggling with a stomach muscle injury. He called for a trainer after losing his serve to fall behind, 2-1, and the number of errors he sprayed far wide indicated he was laboring to control his shots.Djokovic, sensing that vulnerability, used his punishing serve to keep control of the match.Djokovic has long grown used to running into an unbeatable Federer in Grand Slam events, including the Open final in 2007, which Federer won in straight sets.Federer beat Djokovic in the final of a recent hardcourt tournament in Cincinnati, but Djokovic had won the two previous meetings they played this year, one on clay in Rome and one on hardcourts in Miami.Djokovic had advanced to this point without much drama. He did drop a set in his third round match against Jesse Witten, but seemed to crank up his game in an easy three-set victory against Radek Stepanek.After that match, which was played at night on Arthur Ashe Stadium, ESPN had time to fill at the end of the broadcast, which it did by having John McEnroe walk down to the court to hit against Djokovic, who also entertained the crowd with an impression of McEnroe. It was the first public chance for Djokovic to rehabilitate his image here.“I learned from my mistakes,” he said. “It’s all right, as long as I realize the things that happen and try to take the best out of it, and then try to gain back the crowd.”'"
"'09-09-10,'1','The McDonald’s Corporation said Wednesday that sales at established restaurants rose 2.2 percent globally in August, missing analysts’ targets, as strength in Europe failed to offset weakness in the United States and other parts of the world.Sales at established restaurants, those open at least 13 months, rose 3.5 percent in Europe, helped by Britain and France, and increased 1.7 percent in the United States, where intense fast-food price competition weighed on results. Comparable sales slipped 0.5 percent in the Asia Pacific, Middle East and Africa segment, McDonald’s said Wednesday.Analysts had expected an increase of 2.8 percent in the United States. On a global basis, some estimates called for a sales increase of as much as 3 percent.McDonald’s said sales in the United States were supported by the new premium Angus Third Pounder burger and new McCafe coffee drinks.McDonald’s said sales rose 1.1 percent systemwide in August, but were up 4.1 percent excluding the impact of currency fluctuations.As a result of diners’ continued cautious spending, McDonald’s has focused its advertising on its core and value menus and away from higher-priced items — with the exception of the new Angus burger, which is being introduced across the United States.'"
"'09-09-10,'1','“We are absolutely keeping an eye on it,” said Rafael E. Cestero, the city’s housing commissioner. “It’s an iconic complex.”Referring to the people who were part of the original real estate transaction, he went on, “Those folks are going to take their lumps. We are looking at how we can ensure that the rent-stabilized units and the families that live there and families that could live there in the future could be insulated from the unwinding of this deal.”Even with the partnership’s financial problems pointing to a possible default, tenants would not be likely to face high rent increases or eviction, but they may face a period of deferred maintenance and disinvestment.Rob Speyer, who is co-chief executive of Tishman Speyer Properties with his father, Jerry, acknowledged the problems went beyond the need for a cash infusion from the partners and their investors, which include Calpers, the giant California pension fund that is the nation’s largest.“The asset is going to require a restructuring,” he said. “Once the court case is resolved, we’ll speak to our debt holders as well as our fellow equity investors.”Tishman Speyer and BlackRock spent $6.3 billion — the $5.4 billion purchase price and the creation of four reserve funds totaling $890 million — to buy Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper Village from the original owner, Metropolitan Life.The deal has become a “poster child” for all that was wrong with that era of easy credit, highly speculative deals and greed, said Ben Thypin, an analyst at Real Capital Analytics, a research firm.It remains to be seen if its recent troubles will affect the Tishman Speyer image and the willingness of investors to risk their money with the company.A recent report from Realpoint, a credit rating agency, estimates the property has a value today of $2.13 billion — less than half of what the partnership borrowed to buy it.“The lender has to determine its own interests, as does the equity,” Rob Speyer said. “When the time comes we will be fair and reasonable and hope to get a new deal done.”Like other developers, Tishman Speyer has been hurt by the collapse of the real estate and credit markets. A partnership led by the Speyers defaulted recently on debt payments for its $2.8 billion acquisition of CarrAmerica, a collection of 28 prime office buildings in Washington.That partnership’s $22 billion purchase of Archstone-Smith Trust, a collection of 400 apartment complexes, has also fared poorly. Earlier this year, the banks that financed the deal were asked to pour in an additional $500 million to give Archstone more time to sell properties and reduce its debt. Tishman Speyer, whose investment fund invested $250 million in the deal expecting to get 13 percent of the profits, declined to participate in further financing. Its 1 percent stake was reduced substantially.Rob Speyer said that in both cases the properties have “a lot of long-term value.” But the bad deals represent only a fraction of the $35 billion in real estate assets that it owns or manages around the world. At the market’s height, he said the company sold $10 billion worth of property over six months in 2007, including the former New York Times Building in Manhattan, which went for $525 million, three times what it paid less than three years earlier.The Speyers insist their company is still providing investors with “20 percent returns” and has $2 billion to invest in new deals. “You show me anybody who measured up to that standard,” Jerry Speyer said.Still, the purchase of Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper Village was one of the more scrutinized of its deals in recent years. The winning bid presumed the partnership could increase profits by renovating and deregulating apartments, but the owners have been unable to quickly convert apartments to market rates.Daniel R. Garodnick, a city councilman who lives in Peter Cooper Village, said Tishman Speyer had problems of “its own making.”“Residents are increasingly concerned that the maintenance of the buildings is slipping, even as they are getting hit with a flurry of potential charges for major capital improvements,” he said.In March, the Appellate Division of the State Supreme Court ruled unanimously that the Tishman Speyer partnership and the prior owner, Met Life, had wrongfully deregulated about 4,350 apartments and raised rents beyond certain set levels, while receiving tax breaks from the city.Tishman Speyer, Met Life and much of the real estate industry in New York appealed to the state’s highest court If the Appellate Court is upheld, the market-rate tenants could seek treble damages, which could cost the partnership more than $200 million. Even if it the ruling is overturned, the partnership still must renegotiate its loans or face foreclosure.At Stuyvesant Town, there is a $3 billion first mortgage, or commercial mortgage-backed security, and a $1.4 billion second loan held by SL Green and others.Finally, there is $1.9 billion in equity put up by Tishman Speyer, BlackRock and their investors. Tishman Speyer, which generally earns development and management fees from the properties, has about $56 million of its money in the deal.“I’d say their equity has been wiped out,” said Craig Leupold, president of Green Street Advisors, “given the decline in apartment values.”'"

"'09-09-11,'0','Polamalu’s knees have been vulnerable before. In 2006, he missed three games with a M.C.L. injury in his left knee, and in 2007, he missed four games with a posterior cruciate ligament injury in his right knee.Still, the Steelers, with their six Super Bowl championships, are a constant in an ever-changing N.F.L. The new season that kicked off here will be played against the backdrop of empty seats born of economic strife (although not in Pittsburgh, where the 65,110 people who packed Heinz Field set a new franchise attendance record for a regular-season game), labor tension between owners and players, Brett Favre wearing purple in Minnesota, Michael Vick trying to resurrect his career in Philadelphia, and 11 coaches in new jobs and several more worried about keeping theirs.The style the Steelers share with the Titans — they are built on long-term coaches and stalwart defenses — won’t make any offensive highlight videos. The slugfest that developed Thursday night was rife with mistakes and penalties, a typically sloppy season opener that the Steelers were fortunate to escape.“We talked about big men and blades of grass — winning the trench warfare, we didn’t do that,” Tomlin said. “I thought we had to take care of the football and win the turnover battle. We didn’t do that. We talked about out-hitting them. The jury is out on that. That last thing we talked about was not riding the emotional roller coaster and being prepared to play 60-plus minutes of football. We did that. We did a great job of it. Such is life in the N.F.L.”The Titans, the best American Football Conference team in the 2008 regular season, are facing a formidable challenge this season. They lost the dominating defensive tackle Albert Haynesworth to free agency and the Washington Redskins. But on Thursday night, at least, they showed little ill effect, getting pressure on Roethlisberger with their front four defensive linemen and annihilating the running game, which managed just 36 yards as the offensive line struggled to block. The Steelers’ offense had success only when Roethlisberger was in hurry-up mode. On the Steelers’ first scoring drive, Roethlisberger toyed with the defense with pump fakes and when receiver Santonio Holmes split two safeties on his way to the end zone, Roethlisberger hit him with a 34-yard touchdown pass that provided a nice symmetry to the evening: Holmes had scored the final points of the 2008 season with a leaping winning touchdown catch in the back corner of the end zone at the Super Bowl, and now he has scored the first points of the 2009 season, too.The rest of the season may not be so poetic for the Steelers, though, particularly if Polamalu’s absence is for an extended period. His play in the first half before his injury was electric. He made a brilliant leaping, one-handed interception that kept the Titans from getting inside the 5-yard line and had six tackles before he went out. Polamalu was hurt when Alge Crumpler, the mammoth Titans tight end, landed on him as the Steelers blocked a Titans field goal attempt late in the second quarter — the second Titans field goal to fail in the first half — and on the Titans next drive, his absence was obvious, with the Titans able to run and pass into wide-open spaces in the secondary on a touchdown drive.“The standard is the standard for the 11 men on the field for us,” Tomlin said.It just may not be the 11 they want.'"
"'09-09-11,'0','“Obviously it was a calculated plan,” said de Villiers, suggesting that someone might have leaked the story in an attempt to destabilize Oudin during the Open. “The allegations are over two years old. It had absolutely nothing to do with what happened last night, the way Melanie played. We dealt with this situation ages ago, so it wasn’t anything new.”Oudin was not asked to respond to the SI.com report. “When I play on the court, I don’t think about anything but the ball or me,” she said Thursday, attributing her muted performance to Wozniacki’s consistency and her own weariness.“A lot of the media and stuff, you don’t realize how much more it is than just playing tennis,” she said, explaining that she was “exhausted.”According to SI.com, John Oudin claimed in a sworn statement on Aug. 10 of this year that both Leslie Oudin and de Villiers admitted their affair when he confronted them separately. In his sworn statement, John Oudin also maintained, according to SI.com, that Melanie Oudin had suspicions of the affair and had alerted her father.De Villiers rejected both those accusations. “That’s a lie, that he asked me directly and that Melanie had suspicions, because there’s nothing to have suspicions about,” de Villiers said. “I don’t want to say too much, except that. A lot of it is not true. I’ll let my lawyer take care of it.”Leslie Oudin was in New York for all of Oudin’s matches at the Open, while John Oudin, a senior account executive at salesforce.com, traveled back and forth from Georgia with the Oudins’ other two daughters. John Oudin was sitting in the players’ box on Monday for Oudin’s victory over Nadia Petrova and talked proudly afterward of Melanie’s mental strength and French roots, but he was not in the box for the match against Wozniacki and could not be reached for comment Thursday.Lawyers in the divorce case, which is ongoing, did not respond to phone messages. The court records at Cobb County Superior Court in Georgia were sealed this week by the presiding judge, an unusual move for a divorce proceeding in Georgia.De Villiers, who has been coaching Oudin since she was 9, said that the details of the divorce case becoming public had been personally difficult in an otherwise joyful time. “Of course it is,” he said. “I can take care of myself. I just don’t understand why people would want to involve somebody who is innocent. All the daughters. Why do they have to deal with this?”SI.com reported that, in a temporary court order dated Dec. 16, 2008, John and Leslie Oudin had agreed that Leslie would interact with de Villiers only in matters that specifically related to their children’s tennis activities and that Leslie would not travel with de Villiers to any tournaments in which their children were participating.De Villiers confirmed that he stepped away from coaching Oudin earlier this year, delegating much of the responsibility to his business partner Grant Stafford, a former touring professional.Asked if that was because of the family problems, de Villiers answered, “Right.”But de Villiers said he stood by what he said earlier in the tournament about the Oudins’ lack of interference in his work being critical to Melanie’s success. “I did the scheduling, and they never interfered with the on-court coaching or the vision I had for Melanie,” he said. “I never had pressure on me to get results.”De Villiers said he resumed traveling with Oudin and serving as her primary coach in the spring, which was when her results improved dramatically. He was with her for Wimbledon and the Open, where Oudin was consistently complimentary of de Villiers, saying he was “like another dad to me” and that “we’ve been through a lot together.”The two met for breakfast Thursday. “At the end of the day, she just wants to play tennis,” he said. “She didn’t even know how much money she won.”Pressed, Oudin guessed she had won $70,000. The actual total for reaching the quarterfinals was $175,000. “She had absolutely no clue,” de Villiers said.'"
"'09-09-11,'0','Back in the heady days of March, when the Mets’ spring training complex brimmed with hope and long before their disabled list looked like a lineup card, Bobby Parnell was being groomed for the starting rotation — or at least a starring role in the bullpen — for the coming season.Six months later, Parnell is still auditioning for the coming season.Since he was dropped into the rotation last month, he has done little to help his cause. Still, with nothing left to play for this season, the Mets can afford to keep giving him chances. Even after a disastrous first inning Thursday night at Citi Field, they elected to leave him on the mound to get a better look at him.“We have to know where an individual is mentally and see whether it is productive to keep giving him an opportunity as to possibly developing or evolving into a guy who can start at this level,” Manager Jerry Manuel said.One more win or one more loss would not have a lasting effect on the Mets’ fortunes. Though for the record, they yet again failed to dent the Marlins’ hopes of catching the wild-card leaders, losing by 13-4 to complete a three-game sweep. Around this time last season, with the Marlins out of contention and the Mets chasing the playoffs, the Marlins were not so generous.What the Mets ultimately got to see from Parnell were five difficult innings in which he allowed six runs (five earned) on seven hits, while walking five. His first inning was abysmal; he threw 40 pitches and walked in two runs with the bases loaded. Nine Marlins players came to the plate.More worrisome for the Mets than just one bad inning is Parnell’s inability to string two decent starts together.'"
"'09-09-11,'0','In the Supreme Court this week, Elena Kagan, the new solicitor general, eloquently defended the longstanding ban on corporate spending in political campaigns. But the conservative justices who spoke showed a disdain for both Congress’s laws and for the court’s own prior rulings. If the ban is struck down, as we fear, elections could be swamped by special-interest money.Conservative jurists talk about judicial modesty and deferring to the elected branches. But in the questioning, Justice Antonin Scalia made clear that he considers Congress to be a self-interested actor when it writes campaign finance laws. Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Samuel Alito seemed to put little weight on the fact that the court has repeatedly upheld a ban on corporate campaign expenditures.What the conservatives seemed most concerned about was protecting the interests of corporations. The chief justice and Justice Scalia seemed especially perturbed that what they see as the inviolable right of these legal constructs to speak might be infringed upon.The conservatives also seemed incredulous that vast amounts of corporate money flooding into campaigns could be seen as corrupting the system. We agree with Senator John McCain, who told reporters after the argument that he was troubled by the “extreme naïveté” some of the justices showed about the role of special-interest money in Congressional lawmaking.The more liberal justices — including Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who was participating in her first argument — were far more sympathetic to the ban on corporate expenditures, but they have only four votes.There is still some hope that Chief Justice Roberts may decide his affection for corporations is less important than the reputation of the Roberts court. If he does, there is a chance for a limited, and relatively undamaging, ruling that hews closely to the facts of this case.'"
"'09-09-11,'0','“Last year, we probably averaged 100 cars at the Open,” said Larry Liebert, a dispatcher for Executive Transportation Group, standing on the corner connecting incoming phone reservations to a pack of eager drivers. “This year, it’s probably 40 or 50. It’s terrible. It’s a microcosm of what’s going on in the city.”Liebert looked around. He spotted only two other on-the-street dispatchers from other companies. In previous years he would see seven or eight. He and others estimated that business for the thousands of for-hire cars, called black cars by the drivers, is half of what it was a year or two ago — throughout New York City and at the Open.A few packs of waiting cars can be found during the day on the edges of nearby Flushing Meadows-Corona Park and on nearby side streets. But when the automotive shops close at 6:30, the cars move in. They back into both sides of Willets Point Boulevard, a dimly lit, rutted lane that juts diagonally from the intersection of Roosevelt Avenue and 126th Street.“Pakistan has better roads than this,” one driver said.On Tuesday, more cars crowded in, double parking as darkness settled. Drivers, most from Pakistan or India, huddled in small groups, chatting amicably. Others sat in their cars alone. They waited for a dispatcher to tell them that they would be giving someone a ride, somewhere. About 80 percent of the rides are to Manhattan, drivers said.Aziz Rehman arrived at 3 p.m. on Sunday and parked his car. It did not move until he drove it home nine hours later. The same thing happened Monday. On Tuesday, at about 10 p.m., he got customers needing a ride to Brooklyn. It was a $45 trip. After commissions, fees, gas and insurance, he will probably end up with less than half of that.“Last year, within one hour, a driver would have a job,” said Inderit Singh, a dispatcher for Charge & Ride, which had six drivers waiting at Willets Point and one reservation. “This year, a guy is here at 3 and gets no job. They are lucky to go home with $50. Then how does he feed his children? Get gas?”Majeed, another of the Charge & Ride drivers, said he booked $57,000 worth of trips on his 2003 Lincoln last year. So far this year, he said, he has not reached $30,000. He scrolled his BlackBerry and pulled up the company’s reservation list.Every New York neighborhood has a code. Downtown Manhattan is 1, and the area around the tennis center and the baseball stadium is 54.The screen showed how many cars were in each neighborhood, and how many reservations existed there. At about 9 p.m. Tuesday, there were 100 cars working around New York City. There were three reservations.Reservations are required for black cars, and hustling for fares can be met with steep fines by the Taxi and Limousine Commission. Drivers view the commission with disdain, complaining about its fees, rules and a perceived favoritism toward taxis. Some likened the commission to a vampire, sucking the life from their livelihood. Increasingly, drivers troll for their fares, weary of waiting for reservations that never come.As the hours slid on, and the first of the evening matches ended, fans with black car reservations made their way to Willets Point, where the sound of the organ at Citi Field can be heard and one of the video screens atop Arthur Ashe Stadium can barely be seen. Some ambled through the dim light, looking and calling for the driver matching the company name and car number that they booked. Drivers perked up and held white placards with the information to help make the connection.Majeed was No. 4 in line among drivers from his company, but then a quick flurry of dispatches arrived. One driver was ecstatic to receive a job to Westchester County, a $100 trip. Majeed moved to No. 1 at about 10 p.m., and his mood brightened.“But with one ride I cannot survive,” he said.Activity increased, and Willets Point became a jam of cars and people. Horns honked. The train rumbled by every few minutes. Planes from La Guardia charged overhead. Majeed’s phone rang at 11:18. The reservation did not say where the clients were headed, or exactly when.“Hopefully they’re going to Jersey,” he said. And he waited some more.It was about midnight when Rafael Nadal won his fourth-round match with Gaël Monfils. Majeed was summoned to pick up the customers a couple of blocks closer to the tennis center.Less than an hour later, Majeed was on the phone. It had been a $52 trip to Manhattan’s Upper West Side.He headed back home to Queens, his back seat empty again. Another day awaited.'"
"'09-09-11,'0','Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, left, drew the wrath of Israel’s news media on Thursday over what they described as lies by his office about a secret flight to Russia. Explaining why he had disappeared from public view for a day, a statement issued Monday by the prime minister’s office quoted his military attaché as saying that Mr. Netanyahu had visited a security installation in Israel. Israeli news media reported that he had toured a facility belonging to the Mossad intelligence agency. But on Wednesday, the newspaper Yediot Aharonot reported that Mr. Netanyahu had instead flown secretly to Moscow to voice concern over the possible sale of Russian antiaircraft missiles to Iran. In Moscow, Russian officials originally said no visit had taken place. But on Thursday, Andrei Nesterenko, a Foreign Ministry spokesman, told reporters, “I am not saying yes or no; I am just saying I don’t have any information.” Mr. Netanyahu has not responded directly to the reports of a secret trip.'"
"'09-09-11,'0','“I think this is about reminding people about the rush you get from shopping,” Mr. Kors said. “Whenever I’m shopping and someone says, ‘Oh, would you like me to put that in your bag?’ I’m like, ‘No, I want another bag!’ I like too many bags!”Similar events intended to encourage shopping were being held in Paris, Milan and other cities around the world on Thursday. Mayor Bloomberg, once he arrived at Macy’s, said fashion was a $10 billion industry that employed 175,000 people in New York City, which has more apparel-related businesses than Paris. But it was impossible to gauge the immediate impact of the shopping parties, or whether they will have a long-term effect on consumer attitudes. Mr. Lundgren said he was confident that sales on Thursday night would at least cover the expense of keeping eight Macy’s stores nationwide open late for the promotion.Not everyone was buying it, or buying anything, for that matter, but thousands of people still came out to see celebrities and famous designers in stores around the city. Donna Karan and the Olsen twins were at Bergdorf Goodman, Justin Timberlake at Saks Fifth Avenue and Gwen Stefani at Bloomingdale’s, creating one of the most visible fashion industry initiatives in recent memory. It had at least one clearly positive result for retailers: they were busy.“For now I’m drinking and hanging out with friends,” said Charysh Randolph, a pharmacy student who was shopping at Opening Ceremony, a designer boutique in SoHo. “I’m holding out. I’ll check out all the stores and see what I can afford.”That store had taken on the raucous air of a street bazaar, with a parade of funky-looking battered vans parked along Howard Street that were a spoof on the knockoff vendors of Canal Street. Instead of fake Louis Vuitton handbags, the vans contained an assortment of Alexander Wang muscle T-shirts for $90 and Band of Outsider neckties for $20 to $100.“This is incredible,” said Cheryl Taruc, who was examining a draped jersey party frock.But did it tempt her?“Maybe not,” she confided. The event, she said, was “effective in terms of speaking to my aspirations and desires, but maybe not my pocketbook.”Madison Avenue was thronged with people along what was once the golden stretch, from East 57th to East 72nd Streets. Women teetered in stilettos and ’80s glitter glad rags. Guys strode along in suits with flood pants. They were going places fast, but were they shopping?At Barneys New York, there was something to amuse prospective buyers on every floor: T-shirts being hand-painted by artists from the denim label Loomstate, hand massages for women on the beauty floor, salsa lessons at Juan Carlos Obando’s space on the third floor, and Thom Browne meeting fans on the fourth floor.The key to the future of fashion retailing, Mr. Browne said, is to be more responsive to consumers’ needs and fulfill their desires. For him, that means selling suits for less than $4,000.“You have to do it and still not lose what you do,” he said, motioning to a customer who had made a purchase while he was talking — a bomber jacket that cost about the same as a used car.'"
"'09-09-11,'0','John Stossel, the ABC anchor known for his libertarian bent, is moving to the Fox Business Network to host a weekly prime-time program. He will also make regular appearances on the Fox News Channel.A fierce and sometimes controversial contrarian, Mr. Stossel is perhaps best known for his watchdog reports, “Give Me a Break.” He has been a correspondent for the ABC newsmagazine “20/20” for almost 30 years, and a co-anchor of it for six years.Mr. Stossel’s hiring is an important one for the two-year-old Fox Business, which is seeking more viewers and wider cable distribution. Last week the network, a unit of News Corporation, said it would start to simulcast Don Imus’s radio show in October.Mr. Stossel will start work in October, and his weekly program, named “Stossel,” will begin sometime in the fourth quarter. Fox said “Stossel” would include news segments and conversations about “libertarian issues in the United States and abroad,” including free-market economics and civil liberties.In a post on his ABC blog, Mr. Stossel said he wanted to “dig into the meaning of the words ‘liberty’ and ‘limited government’ ” on the program.“ABC enabled me to do some of that, but Fox offers me more air time and a new challenge,” he added.In a statement, ABC News wished Mr. Stossel well and said he would be “an asset to Fox News in this next chapter of his terrific career.”'"
"'09-09-11,'0','Participation in 401(k) plans held steady in 2008, even as the average account lost 28 percent of its value, according to Hewitt Associates, which tracks retirement plans. More people moved their money into cash or bonds for safety, but they did so at the margins. Over all, the contribution rate dropped less than half a percentage point.And in the first half of 2009, when stocks hit their worst levels and then pivoted higher, only 9 percent of investors made trades in their 401(k) accounts, according to Vanguard. At the same time, alternative investments like real estate have suffered mightily, while interest rates on certificates of deposit or even high-yield savings accounts have plunged, making them less attractive.“Inertia has really ruled,” said Pamela Hess, director of retirement research at Hewitt. “The vast majority of participants have changed nothing — not if they save, not how much they save. Nothing.”Now, some of the money that fled stocks for safe harbors like money-market funds and government bonds last year is beginning to return. Even with trillions still sheltered on the sidelines, some $56 billion has poured into equity funds since April, according to the Investment Company Institute.Of course, making money again can do a lot to bolster anybody’s confidence.Over all, the average Vanguard 401(k) balance grew by $3,300 through the end of June, up about 6 percent for the year — not a great return, but better than before, according to the firm’s most recent numbers. In the first six months of 2008, the average Vanguard account lost $6,898, or nearly 9 percent, of its value.As of Thursday the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index was up about 15.6 percent for the year. But the index is still down a third from its peak, and investors are uncertain whether stocks will continue to rise in a fitful recovery hampered by high unemployment and sluggish consumer spending. Even with 10 percent annual returns, it would take typical stock investors close to three years to recoup the funds they had at the beginning of 2008.Daniel Kelhoffer, 67, an investor in Georgia, visited his son in Germany this summer and cruised the lake near his house in his wooden 1959 Chris-Craft motorboat, encouraged by the steady rise in his monthly account statements. Joseph Fredrick, an investor in Cincinnati, exulted that, largely because of his financial adviser, his portfolio had fallen only 12 percent since the market tanked.In North Carolina, a retired Wachovia executive, Robert Paynter, lost tens of thousands of dollars when his stock options and Wachovia shares hit the skids. In October, he told The New York Times that he felt as if he were witnessing his own death with each plunge of the stock market. This summer, he bought a year-old Corvette convertible. And while he and his wife canceled a trip to Europe, they are contemplating a Mediterranean cruise next year.“I’m feeling a whole lot better,” he said. “As ugly as it got, I never got to a point where I thought I was going to have to go back to work or miss a meal. I can take a lot bigger hit than I thought I could.”After the crash, Gil Livingston, a retired Hewlett-Packard manager from suburban Detroit, decided he would manage his own money instead of letting asset managers at UBS handle his portfolio. He missed the bottom of the market in early March, but has made money from well-timed purchases of technology stocks and investments in emerging markets.“I’m slowly sticking my head back out of the ground,” he said. “I’m doing fairly well. My equities are up.”Mr. Livingston, 67, and his wife still have a winter home in Cape Canaveral, Fla., and say they have not been forced to curtail their lifestyles. With their portfolio off by 20 percent, though, they have put off traveling and are considering whether to raise some cash by trading in their Michigan home for something smaller.But many are more deeply scarred from the financial and psychological effects of their losses.Last autumn, as his retirement account was plummeting in value, Joe Mancini decided to sell some financial stocks and seek more conservative investments like bonds, gold and metals funds. Even though he was able to cut his losses, he and his wife are still down about 30 percent.“A few years ago I was hoping to retire when I got close to 60,” said Mr. Mancini, who is 58 and works for an electronics equipment distributor. “I can’t even put a date on it now.”If thriftier consumers become a legacy of the recession, Wall Street’s plunge may have created a generation of more cautious individual investors.Robert Furey, who works at a computer company in Naples, Fla., said he had followed all of the conventional rules of investing: he planned for the future, bought a diverse array of stocks, bonds and index funds and never tried to time the markets. He lost a decade’s worth of gains when the stock market plunged, and said he did not know whether he would ever trust the markets again.“I was a deer in the headlights,” he said.As Wall Street raced higher in the last few years, Ben Silbert, 38, a corporate lawyer in Manhattan, said he tried to talk his wife into funneling more of their money into stocks. But now, with their portfolio down 15 percent since last August, Mr. Silbert said he wanted to make a shift toward fixed-income investments.“I’ve seen what can happen,” he said. “It’s been a good lesson. It’s been an eye opener for me.”'"
"'09-09-11,'0','But while seeded players have melted under pressure, two carefree 19-year-olds, Caroline Wozniacki, the No. 9 seed from Denmark, and the unseeded Yanina Wickmayer, also of Belgium, stepped over the detritus and onto the Arthur Ashe Stadium court to appear in their first Grand Slam semifinal.They are the fearless baseliners of this new era. Ten years ago when Clijsters and Williams were playing at the Open, Wickmayer was trying to cope with the death of her mother, moving with her father to Florida to the Saddlebrook Tennis Academy to begin a career on a lark. Now ranked No. 50 in the world, Wickmayer has made the biggest leap of any woman in the field.Wozniacki came into this open having won three tournaments this season, including New Haven on August 29th. She marched through the early rounds of the Open, becoming the first Danish tennis player to make a Grand Slam semifinals. She charmed the crowd in her own sweet but powerful way on Wednesday night, apologizing when she dispatched the newest New York darling, Melanie Oudin, in the quarterfinals.Oudin, on Thursday, had these words of advice for Wickmayer. “Caroline is a very very consistent player and she’s not going to give you anything for free,” Oudin said. “So, you’re going to have to play extremely well and not miss.”It is the habit of teenage superstars in waiting to overhit. Even Serena Williams did it back in 1999 in that third-round Open match against Clijsters, who even then was defining herself as a counterpuncher.“I was kind of just bringing a lot of balls back and she was kind of missing them,” Clijsters recalled this week. “But then at 5-2 in the third set where I was up, she just — bang — started going for aces, started hitting winners. Like something switched in her head.”Clijsters added: “That’s something great players can do, and she definitely has it.”Since that first meeting, Williams has won six of seven against Clijsters, her only defeat coming in 2002 in the indoor end of season W.T.A. Tour championships. While Clijsters has never had the demeanor to be her thorny antagonist, Clijsters has been on the other side of the net in some of Williams’ more emotionally-charged matches.If Williams is roaring into her 17th Grand Slam semifinal without having dropped a set, it is Clijsters who is bringing the fresh perspective, carrying her baggage only in her diaper bag.“Now it’s like a totally different level, because she has absolutely nothing to lose,” she said. “I think that’s when you can play your ultimate best tennis.”To listen to Clijsters speak of the delights of motherhood at this tournament, she knows that her daughter has given her balance. Time away from tennis has given her perspective that the other two teenage semifinalists have yet to grasp.“I still have an immense respect for all the Grand Slams and the history that’s happened in each and every one of them,” Clijsters said. “But it’s easier now to push that aside when you’re out there and just focus on your game and not be too worried or too impressed by everything that’s happening around you, how big the stadium is, you know, media attention. Everything has an impact I think when you’re younger.”'"
"'09-09-11,'0','A relentlessly upbeat vanity project destined for the Disney family archive, “Walt & El Grupo” documents a 1941 goodwill trip to Latin America undertaken by Walt Disney and his wife, Lillian, plus 16 of the studio’s most creative artists.Orchestrated by President Franklin D. Roosevelt to persuade Latin Americans that cartoons were a lot more fun than Nazis, the 10-week trip also allowed Disney a break from serious financial woes and a troublesome animators’ strike. But the threats of world war, bankruptcy and disintegrating labor relations are all frowns turned upside-down in this legend-polishing travelogue, which spends too little time on the artists and too much on their glorious leader. Whether posing with an endless succession of Latin American dignitaries or enjoying a knees-up with elaborately costumed folk dancers, Disney — and his static celebrity — fills the screen and blinds the mind.This is a great shame, because many of “el grupo” would return home irrevocably altered, their paintings and animation bearing a powerful Latin stamp.Yet instead of delving more deeply into these fascinating transformations — the artist Mary Blair was so deeply affected she subsequently became one of her boss’s favorites — the film prefers to listen to surviving family members share lengthy snippets of missing-you letters. What’s really missing here is a story of artistic regeneration: by the time we encounter a dazzling excerpt from the studio’s post-trip film, “Aquarela do Brasil,” we are only reminded of what might have been.Opens on Friday in New York and Los Angeles.Written and directed by Theodore Thomas; director of photography, Shana Hagan; edited by Lisa Palattella; music by James Wesley Stemple; produced by Kuniko Okubo; released by Walt Disney Pictures.

"'09-09-11,'0','Marin Cilic’s birthplace in the mountains between Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina has about 4,000 residents. Most of them raise livestock or grow tobacco and, supposedly, they also produce a decent wine. But the competition to be the town’s biggest sensation is steep.In June 1981, seven years before Cilic was born in Medjugorje, Bosnia-Herzegovina, the Virgin Mary is said to have appeared there to six children. Cilic is doing his best to work his name into local lore, but it will take a lot more than his first appearance in a Grand Slam quarterfinal to upstage an apparition. On Thursday, Cilic lost to Juan Martín del Potro, 4-6, 6-3, 6-2, 6-1, at the United States Open.Cilic may even look for advice from del Potro, whose meteoric rise the last couple of years has made him a dark-horse contender at every tournament he plays. Del Potro capitalized on the progress he made during his memorable 2008 season to make the quarterfinals in three of the last four Grand Slams.“When you fight until the final, you have many opportunities to win, and that’s what I did today,” del Potro said on the court after his victory.Del Potro is bound for a semifinal matchup with either third-seeded Rafael Nadal or 11th-seeded Fernando González, whose quarterfinal was postponed in the middle of the second-set tie breaker Thursday because of rain and was scheduled to resume in Arthur Ashe Stadium on Friday, not before at 2 p.m. The match was scheduled to be played between the two women’s semifinals, but it could be moved to Louis Armstrong Stadium despending on the weather.'"
"'09-09-11,'0','They say that if you can remember the original Woodstock festival, you probably weren’t there. But if you helped organize that three-day concert of peace, love and music, you can apparently produce a Broadway musical about it. On Thursday Michael Lang, one of the producers of the 1969 Woodstock Music and Art Fair, said he planned to bring a new show to Broadway that would use elements from his recent memoir, “The Road to Woodstock,” written with Holly George-Warren. He said the as-yet untitled musical, planned for the 2010-11 Broadway season, would center on the lives of people who attended the festival and how the experience affected them. Mr. Lang, who is producing the musical with Samuel G. Nappi, chairman of Alliance Energy in New York, said that he was in talks with potential members of the show’s creative team, but that its lineup had not been completed.'"
"'09-09-11,'0','Procter & Gamble officials say they expect sales to begin rebounding this fall as the company cuts prices and adds new versions of its consumer products that emphasize value.The company, considered a household spending bellwether, has been hurt in the recession as consumers have cut spending and turned to store brands and other cheaper products, so the positive news was welcomed by the markets. On Thursday, Procter & Gamble shares jumped $2.28, or 4.2 percent, to $56.04.Executives told investors they expected the sale of Procter & Gamble’s prescription drug businesses to increase earnings by 32 to 34 cents a share this fiscal year. They also said they projected organic sales growth of 1 to 4 percent for the quarter ending in December.Organic sales, which are sales not related to acquisitions, have fallen the past two quarters. The company expects them to be flat or drop as much as 3 percent in the current quarter.Procter & Gamble plans to cut prices on about 10 percent of its broad global portfolio and step up “value” pitches to consumers. Officials say they are cutting prices on Cheer brand laundry detergent; they have said they are also testing a low-cost version of their top-selling Tide.Jon Moeller, the chief financial officer, said the company was not counting on better market conditions, but expected investments in innovation, marketing and pricing to help sales.'"
"'09-09-11,'0','Not all of Haynesworth’s hits provoke sanctions. The Giants have seen the video clip from this preseason of Haynesworth injuring the shoulder of New England quarterback Tom Brady by tackling him cleanly after an incomplete pass.Because the Giants have one of the N.F.L.’s best offensive lines and one of its premier quarterbacks, Eli Manning, protecting Manning from Haynesworth could be a significant factor in Sunday’s outcome.“You’ve got to make arrangements and prepare for him,” Manning said. “We’ve got a game plan.”The responsibility will be borne in part by Shaun O’Hara, the veteran center, and guards Rich Seubert and Chris Snee.Referring to Haynesworth’s hit on Brady, O’Hara said: “You don’t go into a game thinking about things like that. Any time you see a quarterback get turned into the ground like that, you know it’s going to be some sort of injury, whether it’s a collarbone or a shoulder.”Haynesworth said he expected to be double-teamed Sunday, but O’Hara said, “There are plays where you can’t always block him with two people” and that “getting him in a one-on-one matchup plays in their favor.”The guards had less to say about Haynesworth. “We’re all grown men in here,” Snee said. “We’re not going to be intimidated. But we will have respect.”Seubert added: “It’ll be a good test for us. He rushes hard. He’s a good player. We’re not playing against one person.”Haynesworth, who said, “I’m pretty good at what I do,” said he enjoyed the change of scene to Washington because the owner, Daniel Snyder, is easier to see and to talk to than Bud Adams of the Titans. But Haynesworth also voiced a complaint often heard around the District of Columbia and the big cities of the East Coast. “These taxes kill you,” he said. “I feel like I probably made more in Tennessee than right here.”The Giants, after failing to sign Haynesworth last winter, bolstered their defensive line by signing the free agents Chris Canty from Dallas and Rocky Bernard from Seattle.O’Hara said the Redskins signed Haynesworth primarily to stop opposing runners. Brandon Jacobs, the Giants’ lead running back, who may also have to help block Haynesworth, said: “He’s a human being. He walks on two feet, and he bleeds.”The Redskins have not always had the best of luck with free agents. Among those who have not worked out as they hoped were Deion Sanders, Bruce Smith, Mark Carrier, Dana Stubblefield and Jeremiah Trotter.Haynesworth was drafted by the Titans in 2002 with the 15th pick of the first round, a slot obtained in a deal with the Giants. The Giants, with Tennessee’s pick, took tight end Jeremy Shockey 14th and also sent a fourth-round pick to the Titans.The first overall pick that spring was David Carr, who was in Houston and is now Manning’s backup.One reason for Haynesworth’s status in his draft year were the mixed reviews of his temperament after he played for Tennessee in college, where his effort was sometimes questioned.Against Dallas in 2006, Haynesworth’s foot cut the face of center Andre Gurode, who needed stitches to close the wound. At the time, Haynesworth was not cavalier about the incident.“What I did out there was disgusting,” Haynesworth said then.After Haynesworth signed with Washington, the Titans’ defensive line coach, Jim Washburn, told The Washington Post that Haynesworth was “an angry football player — he plays the game mean.”O’Hara joked that he and Snee got to know Haynesworth a little at last winter’s Pro Bowl, where Haynesworth played for the American Football Conference and the Giants represented the National.“Chris bought him a couple of extra presents down at the pool before the game to make sure they were on the same page,” O’Hara said.But defensive end Justin Tuck suggested the mood would be different when they faced Haynesworth in a game that counted. “I know our offensive line wishes he went somewhere else,” Tuck said.'"
"'09-09-11,'0','But there are also “only in New Jersey” novelties. Less than a year old is Paranormal Books and Curiosities, presided over by the amiable proprietor, Kathy Kelly, where you can buy a Ouija board, keep up with the latest in fang lit or sign up for a ghosts and legends walk through the city by night with an emphasis on its haunted history. (In 1934 a luxury liner returning to New York from Cuba, the Morro Castle, caught fire in mysterious circumstances during a storm at sea; it eventually drifted to the Asbury Park shore, where it became a macabre tourist attraction.)Also new is the Silverball Pinball Museum, a big basement rec room where dozens of classic pinball machines are kept in mint working condition. Don’t worry about bringing a roll of quarters. You pay by the hour ($10) or buy a longer pass and can flip to your heart’s content. Placards note each machine’s significance in the history of pinballing, as the simple wooden boxes of the 1950s morphed into the electronic monsters of the 1980s before the advent of video changed gaming for good.But anyone with even a vestige of affection for youthful days spent wasting the allowance with Captain Fantastic or whiling away a dull night at the bar trying to beat the top score on the Charlie’s Angels machine won’t be reading about arcade arcana for long. My inner forearms — for lack of the proper term — were sore for two days after just an hour of frenzied play.Nor do the city’s seductive retro amusements stop at pinball. I also bowled for the first time in at least a decade at Asbury Lanes. Hipster alleys are not exactly novel these days in major cities, but this appealingly scruffy hall, in operation since 1961, blends its old-school amenities (skeevy bathroom included) and hipster credentials (a D.J. playing ’80s New Wave) with an authenticity that doesn’t seem strained. Here, you feel, the cool kids inevitably started hanging out because it was one of the few local places that stayed open late and served drinks.It is now one of the cutting-edge music spots in this music-rich town. A fierce funk-rock band was just concluding its set when a friend and I stepped in to escape the rain on a recent Saturday night. The bandstand is plopped on top of the middle lanes, but you can still bowl in the outer lanes. So we did, even as a nouveau-burlesque show took over the stage. Had I not needed all my wits to avoid the humiliation of repeated gutter balls, I’m sure I would have taken more time to appreciate the dance stylings of Mlles. Gigi LaFemme, Sapphire Jones, Anita Cookie and Sizzle Dizzle.A lineup of such exotic handles you might almost expect to see on a drag bill at the Paradise club in the Empress Hotel, the great gaudy dowager that forms the centerpiece of gay nightlife in Asbury Park. Located just opposite the boardwalk on Ocean Avenue, this classically undistinguished bit of midcentury hotel architecture turns into a throbbing disco queen at night. Gem-colored lights play across the facade, and the crowd at the Paradise spills out into the pool area, where you can check out the men (and women) while idling on a lounge chair, or try to forestall a hangover with a barbecued burger.Odd juxtapositions — bowling and burlesque, burgers frying beside a pool at a gay bar, a spanking-new condo complex with views of a vacant lot dotted with cement slabs like tombstones — are a hallmark of today’s Asbury Park. The city’s revival may hit a few speed bumps, but it’s comforting to be reminded that the most interesting times are often the least tidy.IF YOU GOThe Hotel Tides is (408 Seventh Avenue; 732-897-7744; hoteltides.com) sleek and newly renovated, this boutique hotel is tucked into a residential neighborhood 10 minutes’ walk to the beach.

"'09-09-11,'0','White House budget officials have already scaled back estimates of how much money they might need to keep the financial system afloat. The White House had originally left room in its budget proposal for as much as $750 billion in additional aid to the banking system. Officials dropped that placeholder last month, saying that that the improved financial conditions allowed them to manage with the original $700 billion that Congress authorized last year.Beyond that, officials said they were already starting to phase out some of their emergency credit programs.The Treasury’s loan program for money market mutual funds will come to an end on Sept. 18. Officials said the program had not lost any money and had earned about $1.2 billion in fees.The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation’s program to guarantee bonds sold by financial institutions, which is providing more than $300 billion in “temporary liquidity guarantees,” will either stop making new guarantees at the end of October or reduce the volume to a tiny fraction of earlier levels.And while Treasury officials push ahead with part of the “Public Private Investment Partnerships,” which are expected to start buying up toxic assets from banks in October, that program will be much smaller than originally expected.“The consensus among private forecasters is that our economy is now growing; the financial system is showing signs of repair; and the cost of credit has fallen dramatically,” Mr. Geithner said. “It is clear we have stepped back from the brink.”Mr. Geithner cautioned that the economy remained weak, and warned that it would be a mistake to shut all the emergency programs too quickly. They predicted that unemployment — already 9.7 percent, higher than at any time since the early 1980s — will probably peak above 10 percent before it begins to edge down slowly next year.Even though Treasury and Fed officials are starting to wind down some of their support programs, President Obama’s $787 billion economic stimulus program is only beginning.The White House Council of Economic Advisers estimated on Thursday that the government used up only $151 billion, or about one-fifth, of the stimulus money through the end of August.Even so, the council estimated that the stimulus program raised output by 2.3 percentage points in the second quarter and saved or created 600,000 to 1.1 million jobs by the end of August.“The trajectory of the economy changed materially toward moderating output decline and job loss,” the council said in its report. The White House estimates are in line with those of many private forecasters, who predict that the economy will expand at an annualized pace of 3 percent in second half of 2009 after having contracted sharply in the first half of the year.Republican leaders blasted the administration’s assessments. “The president’s economic stimulus experiment clearly isn’t working as promised,” said Michael Steele, chairman of the Republican National Committee, in a statement.The maze of the government’s rescue programs will take years to unwind. The Treasury, the Federal Reserve and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation have guaranteed trillions of dollars worth of bank deposits, bonds, mortgages and short-term commercial debt over the last year.The most visible of those efforts, the $700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program, has directly invested hundreds of billions of dollars in banks, Wall Street firms and car companies. It has invested $239 billion in banks and other financial institutions since its creation, administration officials said, though repayments by almost three dozen banks have reduced that amount to $168 billion. It has also invested about $80 billion in rescue efforts for General Motors, Chrysler and automobile suppliers, and it has contributed tens of billions to the bailout of the American International Group, the insurance conglomerate. It is also used to subsidize loan modifications for troubled homeowners. .Treasury officials acknowledged that it would take years for the government to get its money back from the car companies, A.I.G., or many of the more troubled banks they have helped.'"
"'09-09-11,'0','HONG KONG (AP) — A former Morgan Stanley banker was convicted of insider trading Thursday after a criminal trial in Hong Kong.Du Jun, a former managing director of the New York-based investment bank, was found guilty on nine counts of insider dealing. He was also convicted of a 10th related charge for helping his wife to deal in the shares of Citic Resources Holdings Limited before the company’s announcement of an acquisition in 2007.He reportedly reaped more than $4 million from the illegal scheme.Mr. Du, who was taken into custody after the verdict, faces a prison sentence of up to seven years, the maximum that can be handed down by Hong Kong’s District Court.The case was adjourned to Friday when the judge will hear mitigation pleadings from Mr. Du’s lawyer.The case is the 10th conviction for insider trading since it was made a criminal offense in 2003 as part of Hong Kong’s effort to tighten regulation in defense of its status as a leading financial center.'"
"'09-09-11,'0','Crude oil prices rose 63 cents to settle at $71.94 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.The market gains have come even though analysts say that a retreat is overdue. The advance followed the Labor Department’s report that jobless claims fell more than expected, to 550,000, last week.Procter & Gamble’s prediction that sales would rebound this autumn also improved the mood on Wall Street. The company’s stock rose more than 4 percent.The Dow Jones industrial average rose 80.26 points, or 0.8 percent, to 9,627.48. The broader Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index gained 10.77 points, or 1 percent, to close at 1,044.14, and the Nasdaq composite index rose 23.63 points, or 1.1 percent, to 2084.02.Momentum grew in midafternoon as the Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner, told a Congressional panel that confidence and stability were returning to the economy after the panic that began a year ago.Investors voiced concerns about the pace of the gains, but few wanted to stand in the way of a market that was heading higher. The S.& P. 500 has risen 54.3 percent since hitting a 12-year low in March. It is sitting at an 11-month high, though it is still down 33.3 percent from its peak in October 2007.Ralph Fogel, co-chief investment officer at Fogel Neale Partners in New York, said that too many analysts were now expecting a pullback for it to actually happen. He pointed to a well-tested piece of Wall Street wisdom that if a certain prediction becomes too widely expected in the marketplace, the conclusion is often wrong.“I’m not sure why this market is going to slow up so much,” Mr. Fogel said. “We look for a nice continued move upward.”In other corporate news Thursday, Corning and General Mills both provided improved earnings outlooks. Corning, a specialty glass maker, said it expected third-quarter sales volume to be higher than previously forecast. General Mills said its fiscal first-quarter earnings per share topped the food maker’s expectations, helped by improved margins and growth of its food brands.Monsanto, the agriculture company, however, warned that its 2009 earnings would come in at the low end of its forecast and said it would cut more jobs than previously announced.The Treasury’s 10-year note rose 1 2/32, to 102 11/32.

"'09-09-12,'0','Gerhart Friedlander, a veteran of the Manhattan Project to develop the atomic bomb and a pioneer of nuclear chemistry who later exploited the first particle accelerators to do major research as head of the chemistry department at Brookhaven National Laboratory, died Sunday in South Setauket, N.Y. He was 93.The cause was coronary heart disease, said his wife, Barbara Strongin.Dr. Friedlander’s groundbreaking research on how high-energy particles cause nuclear reactions, done in collaboration with colleagues in the United States and abroad, led to computer-generated calculations of nuclear reaction mechanisms that form the basis for theoretical models still used today.With Joseph W. Kennedy he wrote the classic textbook “Nuclear and Radiochemistry.” Originally published in 1949 with the title “Introduction to Radiochemistry” and appearing in several editions and multiple languages, it became one of the standard introductions to both fields.Gerhart Friedländer was born on July 28, 1916, in Munich. He fled Nazi Germany in 1936 and emigrated to the United States, where he changed the spelling of his surname.As a Jew, he had not been allowed to attend a university under the Nazi regime, and instead he became a laboratory technician. Once in America, with the help of a scholarship provided by a Jewish refugee organization, Dr. Friedlander received a bachelor of science degree and a doctorate from the University of California, Berkeley.While a student at Berkeley, Dr. Friedlander met his first wife, Gertrude Maas, who died in a car accident. Besides Ms. Strongin, his wife of 28 years, Dr. Friedlander is survived by two daughters from his first marriage, Ruth Huart of Écoust-St.-Mein, France, and Joan Hurley of Agoura, Calif.; four stepchildren, Rabbi William Strongin, Stacey Strongin Blaney, Ronni Mordechai-Strongin and David Strongin; four grandchildren; six stepgrandchildren; and two great-grandchildren.'"
"'09-09-12,'0','Woods shot a 67 to tie Wilson, who shot a 66, at seven-under 135. Harrington was tied with Rory Sabbatini, who shot a 70, and Bo Van Pelt and Marc Leishman, who each shot 69s.Five weeks ago, Harrington was mired in 142nd place on the FedEx points list. His season had been a near free fall from the heights of 2008. He had missed six cuts in 14 tournaments and did not have a top-10 finish. But as he searched for answers, he kept an outlook that can only be described as buoyant. He did not enjoy missing cuts, but he seemed to be enjoying the process of trying to improve his golf swing.Something clicked last month at the W.G.C.-Bridgestone Invitational at Firestone, and Harrington has been threatening to win ever since. There have been setbacks. He had a two-stroke lead with four holes left at Bridgestone, but hit a wedge into the pond at the 16th and made triple bogey. He was in the hunt the next week at the P.G.A. Championship before hitting two balls in the water and making a quintuple-bogey 8 on Sunday.Those two messy finishes resulted in a tie for second and a tie for 10th that had the silver lining of getting Harrington into the tour playoffs, as he rose to 66th place from 142nd in two weeks. Then he tied for second at the Barclays, the first playoff event, to move up to 14th. Last week he had the lead on the back nine at the Deutsche Bank Championship, but two penalty strokes from two hooked tee shots left him in a tie for fourth. That moved him up to seventh in the points standings.Some would look at the blown chances as a reprise of the problems that Harrington had closing out tournaments before he began his major-championship binge in 2007. That is not his perspective.“I had a great chance of winning last week,” he said. “It hurts. I had a great chance of winning in Akron. It hurt. I had a great chance at the P.G.A. I look back at that and go, ‘Wow.’ They all hurt.“But if you don’t put yourself there — I could hide in the pack and shoot 66 the last day and finish fifth and everybody would say, ‘Well done.’ But I ain’t going to win the tournament there. If you do put yourself out there, if you put your neck on the line it gets chopped off every now and again. If you don’t want that, you’re not going to win as many tournaments as you can.”Being knocked down has put Harrington of a mind to win as many times as he can. He jokes about the pressure he and everyone in contention will endure at the Tour Championship, with a $10 million bonus on the line.“I do believe they should give out the cash on the 18th green,” he said with a grin. “Just sit it there just to have a good look at it. It would be great, like the World Series of Poker. We could take it in a wheelbarrow up to the clubhouse. Anything that falls out, it’s the caddie’s.”'"
"'09-09-12,'0','Rain that felt more like a fine mist was falling on the grounds of the Billie Jean King National Tennis Center, and Deborah Loehr, a certified public accountant from Wayne, N.J., was hustling for a bus after spending the day in a suite at Arthur Ashe Stadium without seeing a single point played.“It’s time for a roof,” Loehr said. “Today would have been awesome with a roof.”But for now, unlike Wimbledon and the Australian Open, this United States Open still lacks a rainproof solution for delays and frustration. The United States Tennis Association continues to study the feasibility of building a roof over Ashe Stadium. But the reality is this: with the inability to play on Friday, the Open will be forced to finish on a Monday for the second consecutive year, with the men’s singles final scheduled for Monday afternoon.Weather permitting, the schedule at Ashe Stadium on Saturday will begin at noon with the completion of the quarterfinal men’s singles match between Fernando González of Chile and Rafael Nadal of Spain. Nadal won the first set, 7-6, and leads the second-set tie breaker by 3-2.After that, plans could change based on rain and the length of earlier matches. But the schedule now calls for the men’s doubles final to be played after the Nadal-González match, followed by the first women’s singles semifinal between Yanina Wickmayer of Belgium and Caroline Wozniacki of Denmark.Then, not before 8 p.m., would come the second women’s semifinal between Serena Williams and Kim Clijsters. There is a possibility that the men’s doubles final, between the team of Lukas Dlouhy and Leander Paes and the team of Mahesh Bhupathi and Mark Knowles, could be moved to the Open’s second show court, Louis Armstrong Stadium, and also a possibility that the Wickmayer-Wozniacki match could be moved.The U.S.T.A. spokesman Chris Widmaier said the tournament intended to slide the schedule forward, with tickets originally for Friday’s matches — Session No. 23 — now valid on Saturday. Tickets for Saturday’s day session — No. 24 — will be valid for Sunday’s day session, which is to feature both men’s singles semifinals. Tickets originally intended for Saturday’s night session — No. 25 — will be valid for the women’s singles final, which has been moved to Sunday night and will be broadcast on ESPN2.Finally, tickets for Sunday’s session — No. 26 — will be valid for the women’s doubles and men’s singles finals, which have been moved to Monday. The men’s final is tentatively scheduled for 4 p.m. on CBS.'"
"'09-09-12,'0','WASHINGTON (AP) — The United States said Friday that it had legally certified an improvement in Colombia’s human rights record, allowing the use of $32 million in withheld money from Washington for fighting gangs and drug smugglers.A State Department spokesman, Ian Kelly, said Colombia must still make progress on human rights, and he described in a statement “several disquieting challenges,” including allegations of killings of civilians by soldiers and illegal surveillance.But, he said, the country has “made significant efforts to increase the security of its people,” justifying the certification to Congress that Colombia is meeting legal criteria on human rights and paramilitary groups and that the money can be released.Colombian officials insist that they are trying to end human rights abuses, but critics say abuses remain widespread. The government has been battling a leftist insurgency for years.The International Trade Union Confederation says Colombia is the deadliest country for labor rights advocates, with 49 killed last year, up from 39 in 2007, but fewer than the 78 killed in 2006.'"
"'09-09-12,'0','On Thursday, federal officials reported that one dose of the new vaccine, rather than the two they had expected, appeared to fully protect recipients against swine flu. They said that meant there would eventually be plenty of vaccine for everyone given first priority for shots: health care and emergency workers, pregnant women, everyone ages 6 months to 24 years, adults up to age 64 with medical problems, and people caring for infants under 6 months old.The officials expect about 50 million doses of swine flu vaccine to reach government warehouses by Oct. 15, and 20 million more to be ready each week after that until 195 million is reached.Then those lots must be shipped to health centers, schools and other vaccination sites, people must be injected, and each must develop immunity. Immune responses are different in each individual, but the clinical trials suggest that most will be protected after 8 to 10 days.So if the epidemic’s peak comes in late October, millions of people are likely to catch the flu before the vaccine is available.“A month would have made a huge difference,” said Ira M. Longini Jr., an author of a report by an epidemic-modeling team at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle and the University of Washington.If one shot turns out to be protective in children and if the flu peaks in late December, as the 1968 Hong Kong flu did, “we could be O.K.,” Dr. Longini said. “But that’s a lot of ifs.”In response, federal officials said there was no way to tell whether the pessimistic models would be right, since flu peaks at different times in different regions each year.“I can’t tell you it’s going to be too late for ‘a lot’ of people,” said Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, who is in overseeing vaccine trials for the National Institutes of Health. “It’s certainly going to be too late for some.”In any event, most cases are expected to be mild. The virus has not changed significantly since the spring and, while a few cases of strains resistant to the antiviral drug Tamiflu have been detected, they have not yet become widespread.Dr. Fauci said Friday that the trials he was overseeing confirm that one dose usually created immunity in adults. In the elderly, only 50 percent to 60 percent develop it, he said, but that is “right in the ballpark” for seasonal flu shots in the elderly, since their immune responses are weaker.'"
"'09-09-12,'0','Last week, Judge John F. Keenan asked jurors to decide whether Merck had been negligent in formulating the drug, whether the company failed to warn doctors of a known risk of the product, whether Fosamax was defective, and, if so, whether any of those situations directly caused her injury.But if the notes to the judge from the jurors are any indication, the case suggests that lawyers for the plaintiffs will have difficulty proving that Fosamax directly caused injuries to their clients.“It tells you something important,” Paul Strain, the lead lawyer for Merck, said in a phone interview on Friday. “It’s very easy to make an accusation, but it is very hard for them to prove their accusations against this drug.”At the end of June, Merck was facing about 900 Fosamax cases brought in state and federal courts across the country, according to a company regulatory filing. Mr. Strain said Merck intended to try each one.Timothy O’Brien, the lead lawyer for Mrs. Boles, offered a different interpretation of the deadlocked jurors. “From the common-sense perspective, this trial really showed that it provoked juror passions,” Mr. O’Brien said in an interview on Friday. “This is the most contentious deliberation I have ever been part of. Obviously, it got us to the point that Merck didn’t win.”Mr. O’Brien said there were about 1,200 Fosamax cases against Merck. His firm represents about 400 Fosamax plaintiffs, he said.Many of the Fosamax cases have been consolidated before Judge Keenan to establish common legal and evidentiary issues.The Boles v. Merck trial began on Aug. 12. The jury of five women and three men began deliberations on Sept. 2. A week later, they were sending desperate pleas to the judge.“Judge Keenan,” juror No. 7 wrote in a note logged into evidence midday Tuesday, “it’s very stressful to sit here.”Deliberations became more fraught for one juror on Wednesday.“Dear Judge Keenan,” juror No. 5 wrote, “I am being intimidated, threatened, screamed at as well as verbally insulted that I am stupid because I do not agree.”Also on Wednesday, jurors No. 2, 3, 4, 6, 7 and 8 sent their own collective note to the judge complaining about a holdout.On the issue of whether the drug directly caused injury to Mrs. Boles, the jurors wrote to the judge in capital letters: “One of the jurors is still not following your charge.” That juror contended, the others wrote, that foreknowledge by Merck about a risk from Fosamax constituted enough proof that the drug caused the injury to Mrs. Boles.But, the jurors wrote, referring to their colleague in the gender-neutral plural: “They agree that there is no evidence of proof that Fosamax caused Mrs. Boles injury.”Judge Keenan gave jurors Thursday off to try to cool their emotions. When they were still deadlocked on Friday, he declared a mistrial.He is scheduled to try two other Fosamax cases next year, trials which lawyers from each side said they plan to use to assess the strengths and weaknesses of their arguments.Mr. O’Brien, the lawyer for Mrs. Boles, said that Judge Keenan planned to retry her case next spring.Mr. Strain, the lawyer for Merck, said he planned to file a motion to have that case dismissed, arguing that no jury would be able to find in favor of Mrs. Boles, given the evidence.Shares of Merck rose 58 cents, to $32.54, on Friday.'"
"'09-09-12,'0','What if, a year ago this weekend, the government and the banking industry had somehow found a way to keep Lehman from filing for bankruptcy? How might that have changed the course of the financial crisis?We know, of course, what did happen; it is seared in our memory. On Monday, Sept. 15, 2008, when the news broke that, despite nonstop efforts that weekend, there would be no last-minute reprieve for Lehman, à la Bear Stearns, all hell broke loose.The stock market tanked, dropping more than 500 points that day. The Reserve Primary Fund, a money market fund that held Lehman bonds, “broke the buck.” Shortly afterward, the American International Group nearly collapsed, and had to be bailed out with an extraordinary $85 billion loan from the government. Morgan Stanley was rumored to be next. Banks all over Europe were teetering. There were even fears about the stability of mighty Goldman Sachs. On Wall Street  indeed, in financial capitals all over the Western world  the panic was palpable.Ever since that weekend, most people, including me, have viewed the decision by Henry Paulson Jr., the Treasury secretary at the time, and Ben Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, to allow Lehman to go bust as the single biggest mistake of the crisis. Never mind that the two men have insisted ever since that they had no other option; surely, they could have created some options if they’d wanted to. Or so goes the conventional wisdom.Christine Lagarde, France’s finance minister, for instance, called the decision “horrendous” and a “genuine mistake.” According to David Wessel, author of a book about the crisis, “In Fed We Trust,” the head of the European Central Bank, Jean-Claude Trichet, has said the same thing in private. He quotes one of Mr. Trichet’s aides as saying, “It never occurred to us that the Americans would let Lehman fail.” In speeches and articles, in books and television appearances, commentators of every political stripe have pointed to the Lehman bankruptcy as the event that turned the subprime crisis into a full-blown financial collapse.As we approach this anniversary, though, I’ve begun to question that conventional wisdom. Yes, the fall of Lehman Brothers set off a contagion of panic. And I’m still convinced that Mr. Paulson and Mr. Bernanke could have found a way to save Lehman had they been so inclined (more on that in a moment). But I’ve become convinced that, if Lehman had been saved, the collapse would have occurred anyway.John H. Makin, a visiting scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, wrote recently, “If the Lehman Brothers’ failure had not triggered the panic phase of the cycle, some other institutional failure would have done so.” I’ll go a step further: it is quite likely that the financial crisis would have been even worse had Lehman been rescued. Although nobody realized it at the time, Lehman Brothers had to die for the rest of Wall Street to live.A week ago, a Reuters reporter traveled to Richard Fuld’s vacation home in Ketchum, Idaho, to see if the former Lehman chief executive would say anything about the anniversary. (When Mr. Fuld walked outside to meet her, he said, “You don’t have a gun; that’s good,” according to the reporter.)Standing in his driveway, leading, as ever, with his chin, Mr. Fuld talked about the “pummeling” he had taken for presiding over the bankruptcy. “They’re looking for someone to dump on right now and that’s me,” he said. “The facts are out there. Nobody wants to hear it, especially not from me,” he added.Mr. Fuld’s bitter remarks reflect the way many former Lehman executives feel, even now, about the fact that their firm was the only one to go under during the crisis. After all, they say, Lehman’s mistakes  too much leverage, an overreliance on shaky real estate assets, playing down the risks on its balance sheet  were the same mistakes just about every firm made. Bear Stearns made those mistakes  and was rescued. Citigroup made those mistakes  and was rescued.What’s more, they say, in the months and weeks leading up to the September crisis, the firm, realizing that it might need a Plan B, proposed that it be allowed to become a bank holding company. It also asked for access to the Fed’s discount window, which is reserved for troubled banks. (What Lehman didn’t do, however, despite the repeated urging of Mr. Paulson, was find a partner with deep pockets or raise additional capital.) These are the “facts” Mr. Fuld was referring to when he spoke the Reuters reporter.But Timothy Geithner, then New York Fed president, now Treasury secretary, didn’t like the idea of letting an investment bank become a bank holding company  so he said no. Immediately after the Lehman default, however, that is exactly what he allowed Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs to do, which helped stabilize both firms.Of course, politics played a role, too. Congress had no stomach for another bailout on the heels of the takeover of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac just a week before Lehman weekend. In his book, Mr. Wessel, the economics editor of The Wall Street Journal, quotes Mr. Paulson as saying in a conference call, “I’m being called Mr. Bailout. I can’t do it again.”Although Mr. Paulson would later say that he had no legal authority to save Lehman Brothers, it seems pretty clear from Mr. Wessel’s account that he wasn’t really looking for any authority. He wanted to send a message. That Monday morning, in announcing the Lehman default, Mr. Paulson told the media: “I never once considered that it was appropriate to put taxpayers’ money on the line” to save Lehman Brothers.For all of these reasons and more, former Lehman executives tend to feel that the process that led to the firm’s bankruptcy was profoundly unfair. I’ve heard the word “tragic” more than once. And I agree with them: it was unfair  and, certainly for the people who lost their jobs, even tragic. Lehman Brothers was simply in the wrong place at the wrong time. But for the sake of the financial system, it was also the luckiest thing that could have happened.'"
"'09-09-12,'0','Of course, kidnapping is a crime, too. Prosecutors drew up charges against Ms. Yacoubi, but later dropped them. Calls to the consulate were not returned.The overall uncertainty of Dubai’s legal system — especially the risk of doing jail time for debt — has prompted many expatriates to flee when they are in financial trouble rather than filing for bankruptcy and setting out a repayment schedule. Early this summer, Simon Ford, the British founder of a travel company called bluebanana.com that closed down, issued an emotional letter to “the Dubai public” that was reproduced on Web sites after he fled the city with his family rather than face arrest for his rising debts.“I am not running away from debt, I am purely protecting those dearest to me and getting out of a country which, due to the lack of structured bankruptcy laws and a banking system which has zero flexibility on loan repayments, drives people to make horrible decisions,” Mr. Ford wrote.Some financial analysts say the risk of arrest for debt could also drive away potential new investors and businesspeople as Dubai struggles to recover from the current economic slump.The risk is compounded by Dubai’s unusually heavy reliance on checks. Banks request signed checks when giving out personal loans, and small and medium-size businesses often require them to guarantee payment for large purchases. Landlords sometimes insist on more than one postdated check from tenants as a security deposit.During Dubai’s long boom, when credit was flowing easily, that was fine. Once the market began to crash here late last year and businesses started failing, all those checks became potential time bombs.The root of the problem, analysts say, is that Dubai’s legal structures have not kept pace with its frenetic development. In just a few decades, a sleepy pearl-diving town has been transformed into a hypermodern metropolis that aspires to be a financial hub like Singapore or Hong Kong. Dubai is rightly proud of its economic miracle, and of its relative tolerance and openness compared with other parts of the Arab world.But its very success, and the large number of foreign investors and businesses it has lured here, have led it to be judged by Western criteria as well — and often found wanting. Dubai’s laws are largely based on Egyptian civil law and Islamic law, or Shariah, with no real effort to encompass the tremendous volume of its commerce. While many other Arab countries classify bounced checks as a criminal offense, they are not held to the same standards as Dubai.“Here, business relationships are based on integrity and trust developed over time, and so, traditionally, there has been less recourse to legal procedure for dealing with bankruptcy and insolvency situations,” said Andrew Tarbuck, a Dubai-based partner at Latham & Watkins.The government of Dubai, which is one of seven members of the emirates federation, has not given out numbers of those arrested for debt. But lawyers say the numbers have risen substantially since the global financial crisis hit Dubai last year. There have been so many arrests that lawyers and even the police have begun complaining about the pressure, saying debt should be handled in the civil courts. “Sadly now, as a police force we have been involved in a matter that shouldn’t have been under our mandate,” said Lt. Gen. Dahi Khalfan Tamim, Dubai’s top police official, earlier this year.Some efforts have been made to change the system, though analysts worry that they may fade as the economic crisis recedes. In the meantime, Ali Fariq and his brother sit in jail, waiting for the next opportunity to prove that the checks they signed were not a crime.'"
"'09-09-12,'0','Karen Brandt, a spokeswoman for S.F.I., said that the certification program was sound and that it had met all legal requirements as a nonprofit.S.F.I. provides consumers with details about its labeling standards at its Web site, she added. “We’re happy to provide them with the facts that support the credibility of our program,” she said.The certification program was founded in 1995 by timber and paper companies as an alternative to F.S.C., which was formed in 1993 by international environmental groups. (F.S.C. includes forest industry representatives on its board.)The F.S.C. is bracing for a big blow if the United States Green Building Council, which rates buildings as environmentally sustainable under its so-called LEED system, starts accepting other types of certified wood next year, as it has proposed to do pending a vote by its membership.Scot Horst, a senior vice president for the council, said the proposal was prompted partly by complaints that the supply of F.S.C.-certified wood was too limited. As a compromise, LEED officials plan to come up with their own benchmarks for wood grown and harvested in a responsible manner and to accept any certification program that meets those requirements.LEED officials say that the S.F.I. program certifies more forest acreage than F.S.C. and that it showed more independence by breaking away from the American Forest and Paper Association in 2007.Still, “S.F.I. is the 800-pound gorilla,” said Rick Fedrizzi, president and chief executive of Green Building Council. “That’s the group that we need to try to convince to do better in forest management.”For consumers, the array of eco-labels can be baffling. In the case of wood, Mr. Goldman noted that S.F.I. officials proudly state at their Web site that President Obama’s daughters’ new swing set at the White House was made from wood cut at S.F.I.-certified forests. Yet the president’s inaugural invitation was printed on F.S.C.-certified paper.“If the White House is confused,” Mr. Goldman said, “everyone must be confused.”Urvashi Rangan, the director of technical policy at Consumers Union, which publishes Consumer Reports, said that it judged F.S.C. to have “more rigorous” standards. She and other experts say S.F.I. gives forest managers more latitude than F.S.C., which generally has more specific requirements for certification.Yet Consumer Reports gives F.S.C. and S.F.I. the same rating at its GreenerChoices.org Web site: “somewhat” meaningful, as opposed to “highly” meaningful or “not” meaningful at all.In essence, Ms. Rangan said, both programs have industry ties and could apply stricter standards in areas like preventing cutting of old-growth forests.Certified forest products account for a small fraction of wood and paper sales in the United States, but both certification programs have reported significant growth in recent years. Today F.S.C. certifies about 100 million acres of forest in the United States and Canada as operating in an environmentally responsible manner, compared with 175 million acres for S.F.I.Some experts said the Green Building Council’s move could sharply reduce demand for the F.S.C. label if it devised watered-down requirements for wood.“There’ll be a lot less reason to get F.S.C.,” said Ben Cashore, director of the Forest Policy program at Yale University’s School of Forestry and Environmental Studies. “Why would you go for the tougher program?”'"
"'09-09-12,'0','A federal appeals court dismissed a 2004 lawsuit against two American military contractors by Iraqi victims of torture, saying the companies had immunity as government contractors. The suit was filed on behalf of Iraqis who say they or their relatives had been tortured or mistreated at Abu Ghraib prison. The plaintiffs sued CACI International, which provided interrogators, and L-3 Communications Holdings’ Titan unit, which provided military interpreters. Lawyers for the plaintiffs had argued that the contractors were not immune because the alleged torture fell outside the scope of the work they had agreed to perform.'"
"'09-09-12,'0','If history is a guide, the strong recovery may be an indication that better prices are still ahead. Since World War II, there have been eight periods before the current market when the S.& P. 500 managed to rise at least 30 percent over a half-year period — in 1963, 1971, 1975, 1980, 1982-83, 1991, 1997 and 1999. A year later, the index had made further gains in seven of them.The exception was 1980, when the economy went into a double-dip recession and dashed the hopes of investors who had bet on a continued rise in stock prices.Before that, the record was less impressive. Soaring prices in 1929 presaged the Great Depression, and a sharp rebound in 1930 proved to be a suckers’ rally. But big gains in 1932-33 and 1935 were followed by additional gains. Prices were little changed a year after large gains in 1938 and 1943.The accompanying graphic demonstrates the truth of an old adage: If you lose 50 percent of your money, and then gain 50 percent, you have not come close to breaking even.Italy provides one of the best examples of that. Over the six-month period ending on Wednesday, the FTSE/MIB index of Italian stocks rose 81 percent in euros. With the euro also strong against the dollar during that period, the Italian index more than doubled, rising 109 percent from the perspective of a dollar-based investor.But an investor who put money in the Italian stock market exactly one year before, on Sept. 9, 2008, suffered a decline of 55 percent in euros, or 60 percent in dollars, during the next six months. The Italian market, like the American market, hit bottom on March 9 of this year.The net impact: For the 12 months, the Italian market was down 17 percent, whether measured in euros or in dollars.The accompanying graphic shows the performance of major stock market indexes in each of the 19 countries in the Group of 20, as well as of a European-wide index that is shown because the European Union is the final member of the Group of 20, whose leaders will meet later this month in Pittsburgh, to discuss efforts to fight the world financial crisis.For the entire year, the best performances were turned in by emerging markets, which are back in favor with investors hopeful of a resumption of global growth. China, whose market had plunged earlier than most, was the only one to rise during the six-month period through March 9, and was the best performer for the entire year. Brazil, Indonesia and South Africa also showed gains for the 12 months, while the Indian market broke even and the South Korean market nearly did the same.For the entire year, the largest declines were in Saudi Arabia and Russia, oil producers that suffered from lower oil prices brought on by the global slowdown.The similarity in international performance can also be seen within markets. During the most recent six months, the three best-performing sectors in the S.& P. 500, and in the S.& P. Europe 350, were financials, industrials and materials. During the previous six months, they were the worst-performing sectors in both indexes.'"
"'09-09-12,'0','JOHANNESBURG (AP) — Caster Semenya, the world champion runner from South Africa, has withdrawn from a weekend race amid speculation about her sex.The South African Press Association quoted her coach, Michael Seme, as saying Semenya would not take part in the 4,000 meters at the national cross country championships in Pretoria on Saturday. He had said earlier this week that Semenya would run.Asked Friday why Semenya withdrew, Seme said she was “not feeling well.”Semenya won the 800 meters at the world track and field championships last month in Berlin. At that meet, international track officials said that Semenya, a muscular 18-year-old, needed to undergo sex-determination testing to confirm her further eligibility.News media in Australia, citing anonymous sources, have reported what they said were details of the international track federation’s findings. But the federation would not confirm or deny the reports Friday, saying only that its decision would be announced in November.Arne Ljungqvist, the former medical commission chairman for track’s world governing body, would not comment specifically on this case, but he cautioned that a person’s sex is not always easy to define.“There is no simple, single lab test that can tell if you are a man or a woman,” he said. “It is not black and white.”'"
"'09-09-12,'0','Mr. Karroubi was also the first opposition leader to charge that some Iranian protesters who were detained were raped and tortured. The opposition says at least 72 protesters died in the unrest and in prison; the government has given much lower figures and has said more paramilitary members died than civilians.The speech on Friday, at Tehran University, was the second since the election in which Ayatollah Khamenei used Friday Prayer to issue a warning. A week after the vote, he endorsed Mr. Ahmadinejad’s victory and warned of bloodshed if the protests continued. The government crackdown on protesters began almost immediately afterward.Compared with Friday’s speech, his previous statements about the opposition figures were more conditional, suggesting that they should be punished if it was proven that they were trying to subvert the government.Ayatollah Khamenei said Friday that the system tolerated differing opinions but that it would confront what he called “lies and rumors,” in what analysts saw as a reference to the charges of rape and torture of prisoners. In the past he has said that if such accusations were true, those responsible should be punished, although he stressed that the reputation of the Islamic republic was, in the end, more important than any violations.“Confronting the system and the principles of the establishment, resisting it and drawing a sword against it will have a harsh response,” he said in the speech, which was broadcast live on state-run television.Ayatollah Khamenei indicated that he was following the path of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the founder of the 1979 revolution, in dealing with the opposition. “Imam Khomeini hit back firmly against those who wanted to force wrong ideas upon the system,” he said.It is unclear exactly what Ayatollah Khamenei meant or how strong he intended his warning to be. Under Ayatollah Khomenei’s leadership, some critics were tolerated, many were dismissed from their government positions and others were executed.“Mr. Khamenei’s speech is a final warning to political leaders,” said a former official who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue. “He told the reformers, who claim they are loyal to the values of Khomeini, that he is also following him and would confront them in the same way that Khomeini confronted his opponents.”Ayatollah Khamenei also warned protesters not to use the annual pro-Palestinian rally next Friday to continue their struggle against the government. Some in the opposition, including Mr. Karroubi, have said they will take part.Meanwhile, Mr. Karroubi spoke out about the raid on his office and the arrest of his aides in a letter to the head of the judiciary late Thursday and said he would not be intimidated. The letter was posted on his Web site, Etemad Melli.In his speech, Ayatollah Khamenei also stressed that Iran was not going to compromise over its nuclear program. Iran says the program is meant to help produce energy, but Western countries believe Tehran is pursuing a nuclear weapon.“We must stand firm for our rights,” he said. “If we give up our rights, whether nuclear or other rights, this will lead to decline.”'"

"'09-09-13,'0','It is remarkable how little progress gay people have made in securing the basic protection against discrimination on the job. In 29 states, it is still legal to fire workers for being gay. But momentum is building in Congress for the first federal law banning such discrimination against gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people.Federal law has lagged behind the reality of American life. There are now openly gay members of Congress from between-the-coasts states like Colorado and Wisconsin. And according to the Human Rights Campaign, a gay-rights advocacy group, 85 percent of Fortune 500 companies have policies protecting gay employees from discrimination.But gay rights advocates have for years faced opposition to a federal civil rights law from the religious right, and from parts of the business community, who argue that it would lead to a flood of litigation.Bipartisan bills have been introduced in both the House of Representatives and the Senate, modeled on existing civil rights laws that cover race, religion and sex. Unlike some past bills, these include gender identity, protecting transgender people from discrimination.The bills were written to meet some of the concerns of opponents. The law would not apply to religious organizations, or to businesses with fewer than 15 employees. It would not allow for quotas or “disparate impact” lawsuits, which generally use statistical disparities to prove discrimination.There is reason for cautious optimism. In 2007, the House passed a nondiscrimination law that did not cover transgender people. The current Congress is more Democratic, and even in the past two years, gay rights have made significant strides. As states and localities have passed antidiscrimination laws, it has been clear that they do not disrupt the workplace, and they have not resulted in an enormous number of lawsuits.Supporters in the House think they have the votes. The biggest hurdle is likely to be winning the support of 60 senators, the de facto number now required for most legislation because of filibuster rules.'"

Justice Robert Eastaugh has announced that he will retire on Nov. 2. The council took applications for the seat until May 28.The Anchorage Daily News reported that the suit was brought on behalf of Kenneth Kirk, an Anchorage lawyer who has applied for judgeships but has not been nominated, and two other Alaskans, Michael Miller and Carl Ekstrom, who contend that they do not get enough say in the matter.The suit challenges the State Constitution, which specifies that the governing body of the Alaska Bar Association will name three of the seven members of the Alaska Judicial Council. The council forwards names of judicial nominees to the governor, who must pick from the list.The plaintiffs’ lead lawyer, James Bopp Jr., argued that procedure put too much power in the hands of one group.'"
"'09-09-13,'0','Nauvata, who is 47, has since seen her blood pressure soar, and James, 56, has developed heart palpitations. “There is no middle class anymore,” he told us, “just a top and a bottom.”Plenty of formerly middle- or working-class whites have followed similar paths to ruin: the layoff or reduced hours, the credit traps and ever-rising debts, the lost home. But one thing distinguishes hard-pressed African-Americans as a group: Thanks to a legacy of a discrimination in both hiring and lending, they’re less likely than whites to be cushioned against the blows by wealthy relatives or well-stocked savings accounts. In 2008, on the cusp of the recession, the typical African-American family had only a dime for every dollar of wealth possessed by the typical white family. Only 18 percent of blacks and Latinos had retirement accounts, compared with 43.4 percent of whites.Racial asymmetry was stamped on this recession from the beginning. Wall Street’s reckless infatuation with subprime mortgages led to the global financial crash of 2007, which depleted home values and 401(k)’s across the racial spectrum. People of all races got sucked into subprime and adjustable-rate mortgages, but even high-income blacks were almost twice as likely to end up with subprime home-purchase loans as low-income whites — even when they qualified for prime mortgages, even when they offered down payments.According to a 2008 report by United for a Fair Economy, a research and advocacy group, from 1998 to 2006 (before the subprime crisis), blacks lost $71 billion to $93 billion in home-value wealth from subprime loans. The researchers called this family net-worth catastrophe the “greatest loss of wealth in recent history for people of color.” And the worst was yet to come.In a new documentary film about the subprime crisis, “American Casino,” solid black citizens — a high school social studies teacher, a psychotherapist, a minister — relate how they lost their homes when their monthly mortgage payments exploded. Watching the parts of the film set in Baltimore is a little like watching the TV series “The Wire,” except that the bad guys don’t live in the projects; they hover over computer screens on Wall Street.It’s not easy to get people to talk about their subprime experiences. There’s the humiliation of having been “played” by distant, mysterious forces. “I don’t feel very good about myself,” says the teacher in “American Casino.” “I kind of feel like a failure.”Even people who know better tend to blame themselves — like Melonie Griffith, a 40-year-old African-American who works with the Boston group City Life/La Vida Urbana helping other people avoid foreclosure and eviction. She criticizes herself for having been “naïve” enough to trust the mortgage lender who, in 2004, told her not to worry about the high monthly payments she was signing on for because the mortgage would be refinanced in “a couple of months.” The lender then disappeared, leaving Ms. Griffith in foreclosure, with “nowhere for my kids and me to go.” Only when she went public with her story did she find that she wasn’t the only one. “There is a consistent pattern here,” she told us.Mortgage lenders like Countrywide and Wells Fargo sought out minority homebuyers for the heartbreakingly simple reason that, for decades, blacks had been denied mortgages on racial grounds, and were thus a ready-made market for the gonzo mortgage products of the mid-’00s. Banks replaced the old racist practice of redlining with “reverse redlining” — intensive marketing aimed at black neighborhoods in the name of extending home ownership to the historically excluded. Countrywide, which prided itself on being a dream factory for previously disadvantaged homebuyers, rolled out commercials showing canny black women talking their husbands into signing mortgages.At Wells Fargo, Elizabeth Jacobson, a former loan officer at the company, recently revealed — in an affidavit in a lawsuit by the City of Baltimore — that salesmen were encouraged to try to persuade black preachers to hold “wealth-building seminars” in their churches. For every loan that resulted from these seminars, whether to buy a new home or refinance one, Wells Fargo promised to donate $350 to the customer’s favorite charity, usually the church. (Wells Fargo denied any effort to market subprime loans specifically to blacks.) Another former loan officer, Tony Paschal, reported that at the same time cynicism was rampant within Wells Fargo, with some employees referring to subprimes as “ghetto loans” and to minority customers as “mud people.”If any cultural factor predisposed blacks to fall for risky loans, it was one widely shared with whites — a penchant for “positive thinking” and unwarranted optimism, which takes the theological form of the “prosperity gospel.” Since “God wants to prosper you,” all you have to do to get something is “name it and claim it.” A 2000 DVD from the black evangelist Creflo Dollar featured African-American parishioners shouting, “I want my stuff — right now!”Joel Osteen, the white megachurch pastor who draws 40,000 worshippers each Sunday, about two-thirds of them black and Latino, likes to relate how he himself succumbed to God’s urgings — conveyed by his wife — to upgrade to a larger house. According to Jonathan Walton, a religion professor at the University of California at Riverside, pastors like Mr. Osteen reassured people about subprime mortgages by getting them to believe that “God caused the bank to ignore my credit score and bless me with my first house.” If African-Americans made any collective mistake in the mid-’00s, it was to embrace white culture too enthusiastically, and substitute the individual wish-fulfillment promoted by Norman Vincent Peale for the collective-action message of Martin Luther King.But you didn’t need a dodgy mortgage to be wiped out by the subprime crisis and ensuing recession. Black unemployment is now at 15.1 percent, compared with 8.9 percent for whites. In New York City, black unemployment has been rising four times as fast as that of whites. By 2010, according to Lawrence Mishel of the Economic Policy Institute, 40 percent of African-Americans nationwide will have endured patches of unemployment or underemployment.One result is that blacks are being hit by a second wave of foreclosures caused by unemployment. Willett Thomas, a neat, wiry 47-year-old in Washington who describes herself as a “fiscal conservative,” told us that until a year ago she thought she’d “figured out a way to live my dream.” Not only did she have a job and a house, but she had a rental property in Gainesville, Fla., leaving her with the flexibility to pursue a part-time writing career.Then she became ill, lost her job and fell behind on the fixed-rate mortgage on her home. The tenants in Florida had financial problems of their own and stopped paying rent. Now, although she manages to have an interview a week and regularly upgrades her résumé, Ms. Thomas cannot find a new job. The house she lives in is in foreclosure.Mulugeta Yimer of Alexandria, Va., still has his taxi-driving job, but it no longer pays enough to live on. A thin, tall man with worry written all over his face, Mr. Yimer came to this country in 1981 as a refugee from Ethiopia, firmly believing in the American dream. In 2003, when Wells Fargo offered him an adjustable-rate mortgage, he calculated that he’d be able to deal with the higher interest rate when it kicked in. But the recession delivered a near-mortal blow to the taxi industry, even in the still relatively affluent Washington suburbs. He’s now putting in 19-hour days, with occasional naps in his taxi, while his wife works 32 hours a week at a convenience store, but they still don’t earn enough to cover expenses: $400 a month for health insurance, $800 for child care and $1,700 for the mortgage. What will Mr. Yimer do if he ends up losing his house? “We’ll go to a shelter, I guess,” he said, throwing open his hands, “if we can find one.”So despite the right-wing perception of black power grabs, this recession is on track to leave blacks even more economically disadvantaged than they were. Does a black president who is inclined toward bipartisanship dare address this destruction of the black middle class? Probably not. But if Americans of all races don’t get some economic relief soon, the pain will only increase and with it, perversely, the unfounded sense of white racial grievance.'"
"'09-09-13,'0','TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) — Honduran officials said Saturday that the United States had taken away the diplomatic and tourist visas of 17 interim government officials and the acting president.Interim President Roberto Micheletti said that his United States diplomatic and tourist visas had been revoked in response to the June 28 coup in which President Manuel Zelaya was forced into exile.Later on Saturday, his spokeswoman, Marcia de Villeda, said that the United States revoked the visas of 14 Supreme Court judges, the foreign relations secretary, the country’s attorney general and the armed forces chief on Friday.Mr. Micheletti said he had anticipated the action and called it “a sign of the pressure that the U.S. government is exerting on our country” to allow Mr. Zelaya back into the nation and restore him to office.'"
"'09-09-13,'0','“In all states with initiative or referendum systems, the ballot measure represents the people substituting themselves for legislatures,” said Mr. McKenna, who said he planned to appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in San Francisco. “We don’t conduct legislative process in secret, and it doesn’t make sense to conduct this legislative process in secret either.”Mr. Bopp said his intention was not to cloud the law-making process but to protect petition signers from an effort by “the gay rights lobby” to “harass and intimidate supporters of traditional marriage.”“We’re not talking about removing the transparency of government,” Mr. Bopp said. “We’re talking about whether citizens should be outed in their participation in our democracy.”Mr. Bopp and others opposed to same-sex marriage have been particularly concerned about Web sites that published the names and addresses of people who sign the petitions, sometimes leading to threats or boycotts of businesses, they say. After Proposition 8 passed in November with 52 percent of the vote, some Web sites published maps pinpointing the addresses of those who had given money to help the referendum.Tom Lang, the director of KnowThyNeighbor.org, which has published lists of petition signers in several state races, said his site was meant not to harass but “to create a sense of social responsibility.”Mr. Lang said many gay people “would see signers names and recognize them as family members, friends, co-workers, people they trusted, but evidently knew not of their true feelings about gays.”“This is about how we treat each other,” Mr. Lang said in an e-mail message.The legal battle over Referendum 71 comes just a few months after gay rights groups in Washington had been celebrating a major legislative victory. In May, Gov. Christine Gregoire signed the sweeping domestic partnership law, which effectively guarantees the same rights to gay couples as straight ones.Washington State, however, allows recently passed laws to be affirmed or rejected by voters if enough signatures are gathered, as is the case with Referendum 71, which is sponsored by Larry Stickney, the president of the Washington Values Alliance, a conservative group. Mr. Stickney says the newly passed law “will demolish the historical understanding and definition of marriage.”Both sides are girding for a tough campaign. Anne Levinson, chairwoman of the “Approve 71” campaign, said supporters of gay rights were taking a cue from the battle against Proposition 8, which some gay activists felt was not well-organized and allowed opponents of same-sex marriage to set the debate. (Unlike with Proposition 8, a “Yes” vote on Referendum 71 is a vote to keep the law extending protections to same-sex couples.)“We will absolutely have taken into account what we’ve seen the antigay groups have tried to do elsewhere,” Ms. Levinson said.'"
"'09-09-13,'0','CARACAS, Venezuela — President Hugo Chávez said Friday night that Venezuela had reached an agreement to buy short-range missiles from Russia, part of a deepening security relationship with Russia as Mr. Chávez chafes at a plan by the United States to increase its military presence in neighboring Colombia.The missiles, if the deal goes through, would put within firing range locations in Colombia or American military installations on the islands of Aruba or Curaçao in the Netherlands Antilles off Venezuela’s coast, where the United States operates surveillance flights. But Mr. Chávez insisted that the weapons were solely for defensive purposes.“We are not going to attack anybody,” Mr. Chávez said in a speech from the balcony of the presidential palace after his return from a whirlwind trip to Russia, Iran, Libya, Algeria, Belarus, Turkmenistan, Spain and Italy. “These are just defense tools, because we are going to defend our country from any threat, wherever it may come from.”Mr. Chávez did not specify the type of Russian-made missiles that Venezuela hoped to buy, but he said that they had a range of about 186 miles. He also did not say how many of the missiles Venezuela would receive, where they would be deployed or how much they would cost.If he goes ahead with the deal, Mr. Chávez would have to find a way to pay for the missiles while he struggles to meet other obligations. With oil prices dropping sharply from their peak last year, Venezuela owes an estimated $10 billion to $15 billion to a wide variety of foreign companies, including suppliers of basic items like food.So far this decade, Venezuela has announced plans to buy more than $4 billion in weapons from Russia. Some of these deals have materialized, like the purchase of Sukhoi fighter jets and SA-24 shoulder-fired antiaircraft missiles.Other deals, like a plan to build a Kalashnikov rifle factory in Venezuela, have faced lengthy delays.'"
"'09-09-13,'0','A second problematic assumption of standard economic models is that people are properly attentive to all relevant costs and benefits, even those that are uncertain, or that occur in the distant future. In fact, most people focus on penalties and rewards that are both immediate and certain. Delayed or uncertain payoffs often get short shrift.Given the conditions under which human nervous systems evolved, these aspects of our behavior are unsurprising. Because immediate threats to survival were pervasive, those who didn’t seize short-term advantage often didn’t survive.Such nervous systems provide an erratic guidance system for the invisible hand. Consider, for example, the difference between actual investor responses to the housing bubble and those predicted by standard economic models.When house prices are rising steadily, mortgage loans are safe, but relatively low-yielding, investments. During the recent bubble, unregulated wealth managers created mortgage-backed securities that enabled investors to magnify their returns through financial leverage — that is, by enabling them to invest money borrowed from others.Many experienced analysts had warned for years that those derivative securities were vastly overpriced, but Mr. Greenspan assumed that prudent concerns about the future would prevent investors from taking foolish risks. Real investors faced a tough choice: continue earning high returns from mortgage-backed securities, or move their money to safer vehicles and watch their friends and neighbors pass them by.Wealth managers faced a tough choice of their own, since they knew that many customers would desert them if they failed to offer the higher-paying, but riskier, investments. Managers also knew that if markets turned against them, penalties would be limited by the fact that almost everyone had been following the same strategy. The resulting collapse was all but inevitable.Memories are short. Immediately after a severe flood, most people are reluctant to build on a flood plain. But land on flood plains is cheaper, and the prospect of short-term advantage quickly lures many to abandon their caution. That is why many jurisdictions adopt strict regulations against building on flood plains.The same logic dictates regulation to limit the damage caused by financial bubbles. The list of financial practices that merit regulatory scrutiny is long. But the most important first step is to limit leverage. Existing regulations prohibit banks from leveraging their investments by more than 10 to 1. Other financial institutions, however, are exempt from such regulation. Before the bubble burst, much higher leverage ratios became common in those institutions, which were aggressively marketing mortgage-backed securities. That loophole cries out to be closed.Is it practical to limit leverage in a global capital market? If other countries don’t take similar steps, Americans could simply move their money abroad. But we could limit the leverage of the domestic financial institutions that provide the capital on which American businesses and consumers depend. If American investors wanted to achieve greater leverage abroad, they would have to do it with money borrowed elsewhere. Such a restriction would be enough to deprive asset bubbles of the fuel they require to threaten stability.Of course, periodic asset bubbles occurred even when markets were less competitive. But people in earlier times were less aware of the high returns being earned by highly leveraged investors. Relaxed regulation and increased competition now confront investors with temptations that growing numbers of them are ill-equipped to resist.Alan Greenspan’s erstwhile faith in the invisible hand notwithstanding, it was never reasonable to have expected market forces to protect society from the consequences of this risky behavior.'"

Melcher, president of the hedge fund Balestra Capital.Over the weekend: Dinner parties were canceled. Weekend getaways were postponed. All of Wall Street, it seemed, was on high alert.In skyscrapers across Manhattan, banking executives were holed up inside their headquarters, within cocoons of soft rugs and wood-paneled walls, desperately trying to assess their company’s exposure to the stricken Lehman. It was, by all accounts, a day unlike anything Wall Street had ever seen.In the financial district, bond traders, anxious about how the markets would react on Monday, sought refuge in ultrasafe Treasury bills. Greenwich, Conn., that leafy realm of hedge fund millionaires and corporate chieftains, felt like a ghost town.Then, on Sunday: In one of the most dramatic days in Wall Street’s history, Merrill Lynch agreed to sell itself on Sunday to Bank of America for roughly $50 billion to avert a deepening financial crisis, while another prominent securities firm, Lehman Brothers, said it would seek bankruptcy protection and hurtled toward liquidation after it failed to find a buyer.The humbling moves, which reshape the landscape of American finance, mark the latest chapter in a tumultuous year in which once-proud financial institutions have been brought to their knees as a result of hundreds of billions of dollars in losses because of bad mortgage finance and real estate investments.“This is an earth-shattering event, this is like a tectonic plate shifting event,” said Thomas Priore, chief executive of Institutional Credit Partners, a hedge fund active in credit markets. “This is welcome back to Black Monday.”About 12:30 Monday morning, Lehman sent out a press release announcing its intention to seek bankruptcy protection. Lehman’s 25,000 employees learned of the filing through the media ...Just a couple of hours later, Lehman workers began arriving at the bank’s London headquarters in Canary Wharf and were summoned to a companywide meeting.“It’s over,” said Christian Meissner, the co-head of Lehman’s European and Middle Eastern operations, as he explained that bankruptcy administrators were now in charge of the 158-year-old investment bank. ...“People are just packing their things and leaving, and many didn’t even come in,” a Lehman employee said. “We were basically told to do our expenses and get our personal belongings.”[In New York] bottles of alcohol popped up on the equity trading floor around noon. A dark, squat bottle of Don Julio tequila shared desk space with a keyboard; two rows over, a glass container of 80-proof Monte Alban Mezcal appeared only half full. Pizza arrived soon afterward, two dozen boxes of square-cut slices that were quickly devoured.Merrill, which has lost more than $45 billion on its mortgage investments, agreed to sell itself to Bank of America for $50.3 billion in stock, according to people briefed on the negotiations.“Merrill was a kind of bedrock institution whose stability and longevity was taken for granted and was reassuring to people,” said Steve Fraser, a Wall Street historian and author of “’Wall Street: America’s Dream Palace.”The big insurance company, the American International Group, was seeking a $40 billion bridge loan Sunday night from the Federal Reserve, as it faces a potential downgrade from credit ratings agencies that could spell its doom, a person briefed on the matter said.In another unnerving day for Wall Street, investors suffered their worst losses since the terrorist attacks of 2001, and government officials raced to prevent the financial crisis from spreading.The financial crisis entered a potentially dangerous new phase on Wednesday when many credit markets stopped working normally as investors around the world frantically moved their money into the safest investments, like Treasury bills.As a result, the cost of borrowing soared for many companies, while the stocks of Wall Street firms like Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley that only a couple of weeks ago were considered relatively strong came under assault by waves of selling ...The assault on these two companies underscored how quickly a sense of fear is spreading through Wall Street...“Stop the Insanity,” wrote Glenn Schorr, a brokerage analyst at UBS, in an e-mail message to clients on Wednesday.Some economists worry that a psychology of fear has gripped investors, not only in the United States but also in Europe and Asia...“It’s like having a fire in a cinema,” said Hyun Song Shin, an economics professor at Princeton. “Everybody is rushing to the door. You are rushing to the door because everyone is rushing to the door. Clearly, as a collective action, it is a disaster.”'"
"'09-09-13,'0','WASHINGTON  President Obama warned on Saturday that nearly half of all Americans under age 65 could lose their health coverage at some point in the next decade, as he prepared to take his case for health reform on the road with a public rally in Minneapolis in the afternoon.While the Census Bureau reports that 46.3 million people living in the United States currently lack health insurance, Mr. Obama cited a new Treasury Department analysis that aims to buttress his case that Americans are in danger of losing their coverage  whether they know it or not.“We’re not just talking about Americans in poverty, either  we’re talking about middle-class Americans,” Mr. Obama said in his weekly address. “In other words, it can happen to anyone.”The Treasury study, based on data collected by the University of Michigan, found that 47.7 percent had lost coverage at some point, for one month or longer, during the 10 years from 1997 to 2006. Mr. Obama, using those figures to project what might happen over the next 10 years, says they amount to a dire forecast for the already insured.“I refuse to allow that future to happen,” Mr. Obama said. “In the United States of America, no one should have to worry that they’ll go without health insurance  not for one year, not for one month, not for one day. And once I sign my health reform plan into law, they won’t.”The president is expected to make that same argument later on Saturday in Minneapolis, in the first of a series of rallies intended to whip up public support for his health care bill. The second is planned for Thursday, at the University of Maryland, College Park.The White House hopes the rallies will provide a powerful visual  thousands of boisterous Americans cheering in support of a health care overhaul  to counter the negative images that emerged this summer at Congressional town hall meetings, at which critics of Mr. Obama turned out in force. With antitax groups who oppose Mr. Obama’s policies staging their own rally in Washington on Saturday, the president can ill afford to cede the airwaves to his opponents.Mr. Obama and his aides regard the next few months as the final, crucial chapter in his effort to close the deal with Congress and the public on health care, an effort that began with the president’s address to Congress on Wednesday night. If legislation is going to pass, the president will have to convince the estimated 180 million Americans who already have insurance that there is something in it for them.The Treasury report is an effort to do that. It is a fresh analysis of data conducted by the University of Michigan, called the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, which tracked more than 17,000 Americans  more than 6,000 families  from 1997 through 2006 and included questions about health insurance status. The department looked at Americans under age 65, who are not covered by Medicare, the government program to provide health care for the elderly, and sliced the data various ways.It found, for example, that 57 percent of Americans under 21 were uninsured at some point, for one month or longer, during the 10-year period. More than half of all rural Americans, 53 percent, lacked coverage at some point. So did 45 percent of Americans with household incomes between $50,000 and $100,000.'"
"'09-09-13,'0','Landlords are often unaware that their tenants are operating home businesses; such enterprises come to the housing court’s attention only when a landlord catches on and decides to take steps to evict the offending tenant. In-house businesses wind up in still other courts when city statutes — like plumbing regulations and occupancy rules — are violated.The number of shingles hanging inside apartment doors is difficult to say.“It’s impossible to quantify just how many people are newly engaging in home businesses,” said Ernesto Belzaguy, the first deputy chief clerk of the Civil Court of New York City, of which housing courts are a part. Courts don’t keep a record of these sorts of cases.When questioned via e-mail message, 10 New York City Housing Court judges said they saw no discernible uptick in cottage industry evictions.But Judge Madhavan said that pragmatic landlords are very likely turning a blind eye and staying away from housing court. “There is a lot of it going on, and there are landlords that are aware of it but are keeping quiet about it, because they recognize that it’s a way for a tenant to pay their rent,” he said.Ms. Bushor said she didn’t believe that her landlord or her neighbors are aware of her business, because she sees only 7 to 10 clients in her apartment once or twice a week. Before her roommate’s departure, Ms. Bushor worked in her clients’ homes or in fitness facilities.The layout of the apartment, a duplex, has also helped her to avoid making waves. Her new gym is on the floor above her bedroom, rather than above her neighbors’ heads. Living on the first floor of a nondoorman walk-up building helps, too. “It’s not like there is a doorman, or I am on the fourth floor so they are passing everyone on the stairs,” she said.Operating a business in your apartment can be a simple lease violation, or illegal and in violation of city codes. Businesses that have a constant stream of foot traffic — hair salons, masseuses — often violate reasonable-use clauses in lease agreements. An eBay-type sales business might also be a problem if there’s continual shipping and delivery.It is notoriously difficult to be evicted in New York, but if taken to court and found in breach of a lease, a tenant is typically given 10 days to cure, or stop, the problem, or face eviction.“Landlords and co-op boards are very protective of the other tenants’ privacy, as well as protecting their buildings against people coming in and coming out without security,” said Gary J. Wachtel, a lawyer who specializes in landlord-tenant disputes.Even at-home dog groomers or cat boarders can run into trouble with their leases. “Foot traffic not only could be foot traffic but animal traffic, too,” Mr. Wachtel said. “Paw traffic.”Some businesses are flat-out illegal, Judge Madhavan said.One tenant who ran a nightclub out of his apartment, for example, violated city rules against overcrowding. Tinkering with the plumbing (adding more toilets) or the gas (to cook commercially) can be considered a nuisance, and can be dangerous.“Someone decides that they need an industrial stove with six burners, but the gas supply is designed for residential use,” Judge Madhavan said. “It’s a real threat.”Residents who modify utilities for commercial use or who cause overcrowding in an apartment face stiff penalties. If the landlord decides to take them to court, they may be found guilty of nuisance violations, and are given no option to cure the situation. Eviction proceedings could start immediately.Penalties like fines depend on whether a fine is stipulated in the lease.But in actual practice, tenants convicted of a nuisance violation are frequently given a second chance, a probation period in which they agree not to continue the activity. Often, said Glenn H. Spiegel, a partner at Finkelstein Newman Ferrara who has handled these types of cases, these tenants are required to pay the landlord’s legal fees.The type of building can play a part in how long a home-based entrepreneur can evade detection, Mr. Spiegel said. “Depending on what the specific rules are for a condominium and co-op, the condominium or co-op may have an easier time restricting the use of a particular apartment,” he said. “The courts are more apt to enforce the co-op or the condo’s house rules.”Some home businesses are so small that they might be considered, disturbance-wise, less bothersome to others than a supersized stroller parked in a hallway.A year and a half ago, Seth Adler, 33, an event producer, realized his dream of becoming a voice-over actor by creating an in-house sound studio in the closet of his one-bedroom apartment in the East Village.Because the business is self-contained and clients do not come to visit, Mr. Adler believes he is operating within the scope of his lease. And though his business required some home modification, he said he doesn’t think he violated any city codes. He simply stapled panels of sound-blocking egg-crate foam from floor to ceiling in the small closet.In this homemade studio, Mr. Adler uses his honeyed voice to create 30-second advertising spots. Each earns a couple of hundred dollars, he says.Were he to use a professional recording studio space, which can cost around $500 per session, he says, “there’s a good shot that I would make no money.”Though Mr. Adler’s voice-over work is a side pursuit in addition to his full-time job, having a home business has helped ease financial worries.“Around the third quarter of 2008, we all got extremely nervous,” he said. “Knowing that I had a couple of irons in the fire certainly made me rest at least a little bit easier.”Not all examples are as low-impact as Mr. Adler’s.A 28-year-old renter in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, says his landlord has no idea that he sometimes records and mixes aspiring hip-hop artists and rappers in the living room of the apartment that he shares with his mother and two siblings.Though he used to have periodic work helping with crowd control at events like the Barneys warehouse sale, he said the jobs stopped coming last February. For the last six months, recording and producing would-be singers and rap stars at the rate of $20 an hour — Mr. Adler says a professional recording studio can cost more than 10 times as much — has been his sole source of income, roughly $10,000 a year.He said customers accept the unusual setting because of the rock-bottom price and his product. “They are usually cool with it after they hear the sound quality,” he said. “They are like, ‘I did not expect that from the setup.’ ”Stacy Pitt’s home hairstyling business was so profitable that she was able to move it three months ago from the rent-stabilized studio that she shares with her boyfriend in the East Village to another studio in a nearby residential building. Her combined rent is $2,100 a month.She decided to rent the second studio after a year and a half of searching for a neighborhood storefront turned up only small spaces with rents of $4,000 to $6,000 per month, far beyond her budget. Renting a pricey space, she said, would force her to charge much more for her services and might cause her to lose her clients.“I didn’t want my clients to have to pay for me wanting more room,” she said.Ms. Pitt, who starts her day of $70 highlights and $35 to $45 haircuts at 7 a.m. and keeps snipping until 9 p.m. or later six days a week, said her business has boomed as the recession closed in because clients are looking for a cheaper alternative to a salon.Ms. Pitt said she now earns more than she did as a salon stylist. Then, the house took 50 percent of her earnings, an industry standard. She also charges less than her clients are used to, because of the low overhead of the apartment setting.Salon owners do not appreciate that distinction.“It is a serious drain on the business community,” said Joseph Strafaci, the owner of Joseph Martin Salon on East 57th Street in Manhattan. “Every downturn, every retraction, those individuals who do freelance work swoop in. Businesses can’t compete with individuals who have no operating expenses.”Though Ms. Pitt opened a home salon out of necessity, the apartment aesthetic is now part of the hook. The studio where she cuts hair features a fold-out bed.Clients get their hair washed in the kitchen sink.The apartment setting, she said, gives the salon an indie, underground cachet. Customers, she observed, “loved the kitschy-ness of it.”“It was a very cool thing for them; everyone likes to feel like they found something,” Ms. Pitt said. “Like they found a little secret.”'"
"'09-09-13,'0','To the Editor: In your With the Kids column, “Backpacking Made Easy, With 4-Footed Friends” (Aug. 30), Helen Olsson promotes backcountry travel with llamas and other stock animals. What she neglects to describe is the mess the llamas, and the humans who travel with them, leave behind.Having spent the last several weeks backpacking in some of the most unspoiled wilderness areas in California and the Northwest, I have repeatedly seen the impact stock animals can have on fragile mountain environments. With the luxuries of beer, steaks and other heavy, packaged foods comes a lot more garbage (often crushed beer cans) left behind. With the pack animals themselves come massive amounts of excrement, deposited all over the trail, around campsites, and anywhere else the animals go. In the vast majority of this country, beer, steaks, garbage and the feces of domestic animals are plentiful. Our wilderness areas should be preserved for something slightly more sublime.'"
"'09-09-13,'0','For the Japanese designer Jun Takahashi, fashion is never just about clothes. After his Undercover presentation of futuristic nylon outfits (set to a live performance by Kan Takagi and Atsuhiro Ito) in Florence, Italy, he moved on to a stage where he made witchy dolls from cut-up teddy bears, robotic structures and pieces of lace. “They are like my daughters — they are all women, and they are all named Grace,” says Takahashi, who describes himself as a “polite destroyer”; things that are “just beautiful,” he adds, don’t interest him. “By showing these two types of creations, which are almost contrary to each other, I can give more depth to the Undercover world.” [?][?][?] ARMAND LIMNANDER'"
"'09-09-13,'0','WHEN the financial crisis at the Museum of Contemporary Art here made headlines last year, many in the art world questioned why the museum was spending so much on temporary exhibitions while the bulk of its impressive collection languished in storage. It’s not just a budget issue but also one of museum identity: if a museum is known for organizing big but short-lived surveys and staging shows on loan from New York, is it giving visitors enough to feel proprietary excitement about and inspire them to keep coming back?So there was clearly a silver lining when the museum announced this year that to save money it would cancel several exhibitions and for the first time devote both its buildings  some 50,000 square feet  to its permanent collection. This installation will run from Nov. 15 through May 2010, when some galleries will make room for an Arshile Gorky show. Until then, expect to see about 500 works handpicked by the chief curator, Paul Schimmel, which is less than 10 percent of the museum’s overall holdings but promises to speak volumes about the history of contemporary art.Last month Mr. Schimmel showed me models in progress of the installation, for which he has largely taken a chronological approach, mixing California artists with New Yorkers and Europeans who worked at the same time. Early on, the New Yorkers clearly outpower their West Coast counterparts.The show begins with a gallery featuring eight of the museum’s 11 paintings by Mark Rothko, acquired mainly from the collection of Count Giuseppe Panza. Another early gallery has 8 of the museum’s 11 combines by Robert Rauschenberg, also from Panza.But as you enter the 1960s, you see the Los Angeles art scene take root, and you discover one of the reasons it remains so vital today: Many of its most inventive pioneers are still alive and active. Robert Irwin (now in San Diego), John Baldessari (still in Santa Monica) and Ed Ruscha (long in Venice Beach), for example, are well represented in the show, each appearing at multiple junctions.“I think you will see as the exhibition progresses the growing impact of L.A. artists internationally,” Mr. Schimmel said. “What begins as a sprinkling becomes by the end a dominant force.”The chronological approach also makes for some startling juxtapositions, like a wall where three pieces  a biomorphic Ken Price sculpture from 1962; a sketchy, flesh-toned oil by Cy Twombly from 1961 (one of a few works borrowed from Eli Broad to round out the offerings); and a bloody-looking valentine of an abstraction on paper from 1960-63 by Hannah Wilke  all vibrate with a sexual intensity that Mr. Schimmel described as a “kind of encoded expressionism.” (The installation is hardly balanced in terms of gender, but it would probably survive a male-versus-female counting game better than most, thanks not just to the occasional Wilke but to large bodies of photographs by Helen Levitt, Diane Arbus and Nan Goldin.)Then comes the generation of Los Angeles artists that Mr. Schimmel helped put on the map with his 1992 exhibition “Helter Skelter,” including the shock artists Paul McCarthy, Mike Kelley and Chris Burden. Most of their work appears in the warehouse-style Geffen building, along with a newer crop of Los Angeles art stars, from Laura Owens to Mark Grotjahn to Liz Craft.Throughout, the exhibition has historically important examples of installation art, starting with sculptures from the Store, a mock-retail environment Claes Oldenburg created in Lower Manhattan in 1961, and a mouth-watering re-creation of Mr. Ruscha’s 1970 chocolate room. Also look for a lesser known 1969 neon installation by Doug Wheeler that has only been shown five times in the past 25 years.As Mr. Schimmel pointed out, “People think of installation art as a new thing.” But they are wrong. This show, as strong on origin stories as the museum’s acclaimed surveys of performance art and conceptual art, should dramatically improve our collective memory.'"
"'09-09-13,'0','THE season’s big contemporary solo shows reflect both risk taking and a retreat to safety, sometimes within a single exhibition.First up is the Belgian painter Luc Tuymans, whose reputation has been growing in Europe for some time. His first American survey, organized by the Wexner Center in Columbus, Ohio, and the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, has its debut at the Wexner on Sept. 17 and tours to San Francisco, Dallas and Chicago before wrapping up in Brussels. (New Yorkers may feel snubbed, although Mr. Tuymans has made regular appearances at the David Zwirner gallery.)Mr. Tuymans is perhaps the most influential contemporary painter of the moment. He mines photographs, movies and television for images of unexpected complexity and contradiction, which he renders in the near-monochromatic palette of old newsprint. His ethereal way with heavy subjects is widely imitated but rarely equaled. (Just try to spend an afternoon in Chelsea, or at an art fair, without encountering an imitation Tuymans).This show, with sections on the Holocaust, atrocities in the Belgian Congo, and global affairs after 9/11, will burnish Mr. Tuymans’s credentials as a history painter. Ideally it will also highlight his cinematic way of zooming in and out on subjects from one canvas to the next. (For a brief period in the early 1980s, he gave up painting to make films.)Later this fall, in a leap of faith, the New Museum of Contemporary Art will turn over its entire exhibition space to Urs Fischer, the Swiss artist best known for digging a huge pit in Gavin Brown’s gallery and punching holes in the walls of the Whitney Museum.The show’s curator, Massimiliano Gioni, coined the term “introspective” (as opposed to a retrospective) to describe the exhibition, which opens Oct. 28. It will combine older works like “Bread House,” a Swiss chalet made from stale loaves, with new, site-specific installations. The centerpiece is a three-dimensional cityscape of mirrored boxes bearing images of consumer products. It will graciously spare the museum’s new building but promises to stoke anxieties about late urban capitalism.In mid-December, the flexible, culturally multifarious art of Gabriel Orozco — a veteran of three Venice Biennials, two Whitney Biennials and a pair of Documentas — arrives at the Museum of Modern Art. This midcareer survey, which will travel to the Kunstmuseum in Basel and the Pompidou Center in Paris, should cement Mr. Orozco’s reputation as the poet laureate of post-conceptual sculpture.'"
"'09-09-13,'0','“I like music,” he said in an interview at his Chelsea studio, Roc the Mic. “I can do without business. I think all artists should be paid for their work, but business is business. It’s like a necessary part of it for me, more so than something I enjoy.” He added, “I want to be remembered as an artist first, but it’s not up to me.”At 39, Jay-Z is hip-hop’s reigning anomaly: a grown-up, level-headed, career-minded adult who has stayed at the top of the charts. His songs have told and retold the poverty-to-bling story of Shawn Carter, Jay-Z’s real name, who grew up in the tough Marcy Houses in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, and dealt drugs before turning to hip-hop. By the time his first album came out, he said, “I was the oldest 26-year-old you ever wanted to meet.” Then, all his boasts came true. In “So Ambitious” on the new album, he raps, “I went from pauper to the president/’Cause every deal I ever made set precedent.”Most rappers would be lucky to have an album or two in the Top 10 before being supplanted by younger, brasher competition. Yet Jay-Z reached the top and has remained there since he released his debut album, “Reasonable Doubt,” in 1996. That album, and the nine solo albums that have followed it, have all sold at least a million copies in the United States.On “The Blueprint 3” he mentions more than once that he has had 10 No. 1 albums: “Maybe now 11,” he adds in a track called “Thank You.” (Actually he has had eight No. 1 albums on his own: every Jay-Z album since 1998. The other two were collaborations with R. Kelly and Linkin Park.)From 2004 to 2007 Jay-Z was the president of Def Jam Recordings, which had been releasing his albums since 1997. He put in regular office hours and signed acts including Rihanna, who joins Jay-Z and his past and current producer Kanye West in “Run This Town” on “The Blueprint 3.”Working at a major label, “I learned that every day you have to remind yourself why you got into this in the first place,” he said. “If you lose that passion and fire, then you start doing things by the book.”Last year, as his own contract with Def Jam neared its end, he faced the new economic conditions of pop — dwindling album sales that make performing and licensing more reliable sources of income — and stepped outside the established recording companies. He made a 10-year, $150 million deal with the concert promoter Live Nation encompassing his albums, tours, publishing and endorsements while financing his own recording company and management firm, Roc Nation; its releases will be manufactured and distributed, but not owned, by Atlantic Records and then by Sony.“I don’t get dropped, I drop the label,” he raps on the new album.He now calls the old record companies “archaic,” and says they made a huge error in 2000 when they sued to stop the original Napster, which popularized free file sharing: “They had it all in one place coming through one hole, where they could control it. They shut that down, and just opened the floodgates. Now everyone’s running their own Napster. Now it’s just a hole in the universe, and it’s too late.”The tailspin of the record labels, he said, is “the music business purging itself” of acts that rely more on promotion than talent. Now, he continued, shrunken labels can’t afford the hype: “You have to find the genuine article and you have to put the genuine music on and that’s the only thing that works. That’s going to work forever.”“The Blueprint 3” mixes its boasts with manifestos about the state of hip-hop, which “saved my life,” he said. “When someone does something for you, it’s only right that you repay that tenfold, and that was what hip-hop did for me. How could I not protect that or leave it in a good place for the next generation of artists?”Jay-Z turns 40 in December, and he’s well aware that hip-hop usually has younger demographics. “The reason that you turn off the hip-hop as you mature is because there’s not enough of what you’re going through in your life currently,” he said. “There’s not a lot of people who have come of age in rap because it’s only 30 years old. As more people come of age, hopefully the topics get broader and then the audience will stay around longer.“But it’s so much viewed as a young person’s sport right now at this present moment that it’s very difficult. You want to get on the radio, and you’ve got to make a jingle that’s catchy, that sounds like everything else that’s on the radio.” He laughed. “Not me, the other guy.”For the album’s first single, he pointedly chose “D.O.A. (Death of Auto-Tune),” which ridicules the robotic, computer-tuned hip-hop aimed for pop radio play and ring tone sales. The track’s producer, No I.D., said by telephone from Atlanta that Jay-Z wrote the lyrics overnight while working with No I.D. and Kanye West. “We were having a debate about the direction sonically of the album,” No I.D. said. Someone joked that Jay-Z needed to write a song to compete with Soulja Boy Tellem, who reached No. 1 with “Crank That,” a novelty dance hit. “I saw his facial expression,” No I.D. said. “The next morning it was done.”“D.O.A.” starts with a dissonant saxophone and a psychedelic guitar. “It doesn’t have a hook,” Jay-Z said happily. “But it was the right thing to do at the right time, and it felt good. And then the question happens: What are you doing it for anyway?“Are you doing it to make a No. 1 record, or are you doing it to invoke conversation, to make art, to push the culture? That’s way more important than a No. 1 record.”He continued: “It was a point in time when people had to discuss, where are we going now? Are we going to continue down this path or are we not?”“Blueprint 3” relies largely on hip-hop’s name-brand producers. Most of the songs are from Mr. West, who supplies lush, string-laden, fanfaring tracks; there are also productions by Timbaland, including an austere, ominous, electronic battle-of-the-sexes rap called “Venus vs. Mars,” and snappy, invigorating tracks from Swizz Beatz, Shux and the Inkredibles. Jay-Z has guests including Alicia Keys and young hip-hop hit makers like Drake, Kid Cudi and Young Jeezy. “My phone calls get returned before I finish dialing the number,” Jay-Z said.“Blueprint 3” repeatedly insists, in songs like “Young Forever” and “Off That,” that Jay-Z is still ahead of the pack: “Even if I slow it down, my sound is fast forward,” he declares in “Off That,” while the speed of the music playfully fluctuates. He has already announced that his next album will be more experimental. Lately he has been citing indie-rock bands, and he and Beyoncé showed up at an Aug. 30 Brooklyn concert by Grizzly Bear.“Hip-hop is about the gift of discovery,” he said. “It’s who has the newest sneakers, who has the new pants that no one else has seen. So if I go to school with Jay-Z on my iPod, they go, ‘O.K., we all know him.’ You have to come to school with some new band that no one else has heard of.”He continued, “As an artist you’re fighting against everything that’s new and everyone’s fascination with the new thing. So not only are you swimming upstream, you have someone pulling on your leg: the new guy, the weight of the new guy.”He shifted similes. “It’s like a crowded hallway full of people and you have to walk against it,” he said. “Some people don’t make it to the end of the hall. You’re always in the way. You have to be built for competition.”After a long afternoon in the studio a limo was waiting to take Jay-Z to Newark Airport for a flight to Connecticut to perform a show that night. But something had occurred to him. He stepped into the recording booth while his engineer, Young Guru, cued up “Thank You.”Jay-Z instructed, “The second half of the hook, that last one right before the verse.” The hook repeated a couplet, a detail that needed improvement. “It was bothering me,” he said. “It was a little boring in there.” As the track played, Jay-Z matched the vocal tone he had used back when he recorded the song, caught the rhythm and rapped a new line: “Do me a favor, don’t do me no favors/I’ll handle mine.” It needed only a take or two.Jay-Z smiled before setting out for the night’s concert. “That one’s done,” he said.'"

"'09-09-13,'0','Tolstoy was wrong: happy families are not all alike. Some make applesauce, and those who do, the author of this smartly observed, warm-hearted tale implies, are almost surely the better for it.Narrated by a young boy, “Applesauce Season,” by Eden Ross Lipson, unfolds as an artful blend of family ritual and recipe, with members of three generations of urban homebodies and apple fanciers taking part in a seasonal rite that leads from farmers’ market to stove top to dining room table. At the center of it all is the narrator’s doughty, discerning grandmother, the family elder whose unfussy reverence for a job well done transforms an old-fashioned quest for a taste of the fruits of the fall harvest into something more: a glimpse of the examined life.The grandmother in question is a spry, emphatic woman — an owlish impresario who sees “no reason to start eating apples when peaches are perfect,” and once their high season has arrived, no reason to stop eating them, whether in sauce form or more simply “out of hand.” An urban earth mother in a floppy hat, she is a kindly, vibrant presence, a mensch with a McIntosh whose ironclad rubric of sauce making dos and don’ts hints at a life spent coolly taking the measure of things, both in and out of the kitchen.We glean all this from her grandson, who, with a grade schooler’s swelling pride in his own newfound competence, nimbly leads the reader through the basics of sauce making (a detailed recipe is also provided, in an after note), while casting an appraising eye over his elders. This bright young boy has clearly inherited more from the older woman than a weakness for Winesaps.Lipson, who was the children’s books editor of The New York Times from 1984 to 2005, and who died earlier this year, made this, her first book for children, a family story that points inexorably to the future. With a wink to the reader in the final scene, both author and illustrator focus in on the boy as he wonders aloud what life will be like for him when he’s grown. Endearingly, as though to show whose grandson he is, he frames the question for himself in the language of apples: “Apple pie is good,” he allows, “but I still like ­applesauce best. Maybe I’ll change my mind when I grow up. Maybe not.”'"

"'09-09-14,'1','Kim Clijsters dropped down on her knees in disbelief, and then looked to the stands to find her golden-locked daughter, Jada, up way past her bedtime so she could see her mother spin a fairy tale.Clijsters, the 26-year-old wild-card entry from Belgium who was a former No. 1 player, left the game two years ago to start a family and returned to tennis just one month ago.Suddenly on Sunday night, she had captured the 2009 United States Open title by dispatching the 19-year-old Caroline Wozniacki of Denmark, 7-5, 6-3, in 1 hour 33 minutes before an adoring crowd of 23,351 at Arthur Ashe Stadium.Jada flashed on the giant screen in the stadium, pointing and hamming it up with the same infectious joy her mother had supplied to cap the most unexpected women’s Open in memory, one marked by charming upsets, unsettling anger and disruptive rain.“I can’t believe this has happened, it’s still so surreal, that in my third tournament back I won my second Grand Slam,” Clijsters said more than an hour after the match. “It’s a great feeling to have, but it’s confusing in a lot of ways that it happened so quickly.”It has been four years since Clijsters last played in New York and won her first Grand Slam title. She has played exactly 14 matches in 27 months, and watched as the rest of the women’s field at the Open crumbled under emotions or the weight of expectations she did not carry.“This has been so exciting for me, it was not really our plan,” she said. “I just wanted to get back into the rhythm of playing tennis. I have to thank the U.S.T.A. for giving me a wild card for coming here.”It was not until a weak lob from Wozniacki floated above her like a gift on match point that Clijsters knew she could reclaim the title. She slammed the overhead with ease, punctuating her return.Clijsters was the first unseeded woman to win the United States Open, at least in the Open era, and in the process she became the first mother to win a Grand Slam title since Evonne Goolagong Cawley won Wimbledon in 1980. As she laughed at her 18-month-old daughter, who was still wide awake around 11 p.m., she told the crowd: “We tried to plan her nap time a little bit later. It’s the greatest feeling in the world being a mother.”The final seemed a bit anticlimactic, in the wake of the previous night’s controversial semifinal between Clijsters and Serena Williams.Williams had became so unhinged on match point in berating a line judge  spewing profanity and threatening to shove a tennis ball down her throat  that she was assessed a penalty for unsportsmanlike conduct, and she had no points left to give. The match had come to a startling end before Clijsters realized it.Williams was fined $10,500 in fines, and the incident is still under investigation with a suspension still possible.On Sunday before the match, Clijsters did not watch the endless replays of Williams’s meltdown. Instead, she watched the animated film “Ice Age” with Jada and her husband, Brian Lynch, and thought back to the positive aspects of that match; it was the best she had played in her comeback.Before the ending, Clijsters had outplayed Williams, just as she did to defeat Williams’s older sister Venus in the Round of 16. It was then when Clijsters told herself she could handle the pace that the Williams sisters delivered, and thought that perhaps she had a chance to win.Wozniacki offered a literal change of pace from the Williams sisters. Ranked No. 8 in the world, she is a gritty counterpuncher who has proved to be a consistent competitor. She was the one who had ended the magical run of the 17-year-old teenager Melanie Oudin, in the quarterfinals. She had beaten the Belgian teenager Yanina Wickmayer in obscurity in Louis Armstrong Stadium on Saturday while Clijsters played Serena in Ashe.On Sunday, however, after playing Clijsters tough in the first set, Wozniacki suddenly became undone by errors, and perhaps by the magnitude of the moment. She was making her first appearance in a Grand Slam final.“I’m so excited that she came back, but unfortunately she beat me today,” Wozniacki said of Clijsters. “She played a great match, and she deserved it.”And then, to prove her poise, Wozniacki took the time to thank her fans and friends in English, Danish and Polish.A swirling wind inside Ashe Stadium seized control of the first set, when Clijsters was flailing backhands. She committed 20 unforced errors in that set, and Wozniacki had 12 break points. But she could only convert three of them.If Wozniacki launched her career with this appearance, Clijsters’s second career has just begun.Clijsters had wrist surgery in 2006 and could not return to defend her title at the Open. That injury and her loss of motivation accelerated her retirement 10 months later; counting back to 2005, she has now won 14 straight matches here.“For where she was nine months ago, to be thinking that she would be winning a U.S. Open is just unbelievable,” said Lynch, a former professional basketball player from New Jersey whom she met in Belgium.“We thought maybe in 2010,” he said. “This was a check point for her. I guess we found out where she’s at.”Clijsters began training at the end of February for an exhibition match at Wimbledon. She admitted there were tough moments  but “no swear words like Serena yesterday,” she said with a laugh. By throwing herself back into training, Lynch said, Clijsters was also coping with the death of her father and manager, Leo, who lost a one-year battle with lung cancer in early January.“With everything you do, you feel his presence,” Clijsters said, trying not to cry.Watching her daughter scamper on court, twirling and entertaining the assembled photographers, Clijsters and her husband felt great delight.“She just thought it was the most normal thing, I guess,” Clijsters said.Jada may not remember the night, but Clijsters will have a tale to tell her years from now  and the pictures to prove it.'"
"'09-09-14,'1','Leander Paes woke up Sunday not sure he could play for his fifth Grand Slam title in men’s doubles. He hurt his elbow playing mixed doubles earlier in the tournament and was sore from his shoulder to his triceps to the elbow.But with a boost from his teammate Lukas Dlouhy, the fourth-seeded pair beat the No. 3 seeds, Mahesh Bhupathi and Mark Knowles, 3-6, 6-3, 6-2, in the United States Open final.Paes and Dlouhy won the French Open this year for their first Grand Slam championship together.'"
"'09-09-14,'1','Continuing a pattern that has held for more than a year, credit card issuers last quarter mailed out fewer new-card offers than they did in the quarter before. But 28 percent more offers were sent to consumers with the best credit for two lines of so-called premium cards. About 118 million pieces of mail went out advertising the MasterCard World and Visa Signature cards, premium cards that come with fees and extra services. That was up from 75 million the quarter before, according to Comperemedia, a firm that tracks direct marketing.Since the beginning of the downturn, issuers have created several new premium cards, including the Chase Sapphire and Visa Black cards.Andrew Davidson, a senior vice president of Comperemedia, said the growth in premium cards was cause for optimism about the credit card market.“They’re starting with that safest segment,” he said. Mr. Davidson added that an increase in savings rates among Americans, and a decrease in high-interest debt on credit cards, might have changed the credit card market for good, making premium cards more attractive to issuers, since they offer the guaranteed revenue of an annual fee.'"
"'09-09-14,'1','On Monday, the one-year anniversary of the collapse of , is scheduled to deliver a major speech on the . He should take justifiable pride in some of the aggressive steps his administration has taken to rescue the financial system and the broader economy.Yet, the important work of remains undone. The administration has proposed legislation that would bring most of the financial system under a regulatory umbrella, and impose higher capital requirements to cushion against losses. But in specific areas, like consumer protection, Obama officials will have to fight to ensure that lawmakers do not water down the administration’s intent. In another area — the regulation of derivatives — Congress must improve the administration’s proposal. As Congress considers the legislation this fall, here are some key issues:CONSUMER PROTECTION The financial crisis would have been less severe — or largely avoided — if regulators had curbed abusive and unsound lending back when bad first began to proliferate. But all too predictably, they failed to act.Prominent overseers like the and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency had long viewed consumer protection as a regulatory backwater. In keeping with the prevailing antiregulatory ethos, they also tended to equate bank profitability with bank safety and soundness. That led them to view products and practices that boosted bank profits as “good”— even as tricky loans and lax lending standards set the stage for mass defaults, and systemwide collapse.The strongest of the administration’s proposed reforms — a Consumer Financial Protection Agency — seeks to rectify that regulatory failure. The new agency would take on the consumer protection responsibilities that are currently dispersed among numerous regulators and police the financial system with a sole focus on the best interest of the consumer. It could ensure, for example, that lenders — whether or nonbanks — provide simpler alternatives to complex mortgages and could impose restrictions on other forms of , like stealth overdraft fees.Unfortunately, Congress is already being pressured by the financial industry to weaken the proposal. It is imperative that the final legislation explicitly prohibit the new agency from pre-empting stronger state consumer-protection laws. Pre-emption— favored by banks, financial firms and regulators who are cozy with them — has long been used to reduce consumer protection and regulatory oversight. The final legislation must also retain the new agency’s power to examine banks’ books and enforce rules. An agency without full ongoing regulatory authority would be set up for failure.'"
"'09-09-14,'1','Mr. Obama plans to argue, his aides say, that these government intrusions will be temporary. At the same time, however, he will push hard for an increased government role in overseeing the financial system to prevent a repeat of the excesses that caused the crisis.“These were extraordinary provisions of support, not part of a permanent program,” said , director of the National Economic Council at the White House. “You’re seeing a process of exit every day. It’s a process that’s going to take quite some time, but the prospects are much brighter today than they were nine months ago.”That process unfolds every day in a bland bureaucrat’s haven, an annex connected by an underground tunnel to the ’s main building on Pennsylvania Avenue. There, about 200 civil servants — accountants, lawyers, former bankers — oversee the $700 billion program that pumps taxpayer money into , companies and two of ’s Big Three auto companies.In the main Treasury building, senior officials hold veto power over packages for the biggest recipients of government loans, like and . A separate group, working closely with the , oversees the multibillion-dollar bailout of American International Group. Ten blocks away, at the , officials are still providing the emergency liquidity that keeps a battered economy moving.To Mr. Obama’s critics, thousands of whom took to the streets of Washington this weekend to protest a new era of big government, all these efforts are part of a plan to dismantle free-market capitalism. On the ground it looks quite different, as a new president and his team try to define the proper role, both as owners and regulators.Far from eagerly micromanaging the companies the government owns, Mr. Obama and his economic team have often labored mightily to avoid exercising control even when government money was the only thing keeping some companies afloat.A few weeks ago, there were anguished grimaces inside the Treasury Department as the new chief executive of A.I.G., Robert H. Benmosche, whose roughly $9 million pay package is 22 times greater than Mr. Obama’s, ridiculed officials in Washington — his majority shareholders — as “crazies.”Causing even more unease to policymakers, Mr. Benmosche insisted that A.I.G. — one of the worst offenders in the risk-taking that sent the nation over the edge last year — would not rush to sell its businesses at fire-sale prices, despite pressure from Fed and Treasury officials, who are desperate to have the insurer repay its $180 billion government bailout.But in the end, according to one senior official, “no one called him and told him to shut up,” and no one has pulled rank and told him to sell assets as soon as possible to repay the loans.A similar hands-off decision was made about the auto companies. Shortly after General Motors and emerged from bankruptcy, some members of the administration’s auto task force argued that the group should not go out of business until it was confident that a new management team in Detroit had a handle on what needed to be done.But Mr. Summers strongly rejected that approach, and the Treasury secretary, , agreed.“The argument was that if the president said he wasn’t elected to run G.M., then we couldn’t hire a new board and then try to run any aspect of it,” one participant in the discussions said. The auto task force took off for summer vacation in July, and it never returned.But it will probably be several years before the government can begin to sell its stake in G.M. back to the public, and even then, according a report issued last week by the independent monitor of the , some of the $20 billion or so funneled to G.M. and Chrysler is probably gone forever.By contrast, Mr. Obama’s team and the Federal Reserve have been more successful than generally recognized at winding down many of the support programs for banks. Nearly three dozen financial institutions have repaid $70 billion in loans to the Treasury, and officials predict that $50 billion more will be repaid over the next 18 months. Indeed, the government has earned tidy profit on the first round of repayments.One of the biggest backstops has been the Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program of the , which now guarantees about $300 billion worth of issued by banks.The volume of new guarantees has declined to less than $5 billion a month in August from more than $90 billion a month earlier this year. The F.D.I.C. announced last week that it would either end the program entirely on Oct. 31 or reduce it further by substantially increasing the fees that banks have to pay.Similarly, one of the Fed’s biggest emergency loan programs, the Term Auction Facility, has shrunk by more than half in the last 12 months. A second big program, which finances short-term i.o.u.’s for businesses, has shrunk to $124 billion, from $332 billion a year ago.Obama administration officials bristle at even the hint that their rescue measures have ushered in a new era of “big government.”But supporters and critics alike worry that it will be difficult to shrink the government to anything like its former role. For one thing, Mr. Obama is determined to expand government regulation of business and to beef up federal protections for consumers.Mr. Obama’s proposals to overhaul the system of would give the Fed new powers to supervise giant financial institutions whose failure could threaten the entire financial system.To limit the dangers posed by insolvent institutions that are “too big to fail,” the F.D.I.C. would receive new authority to close them in an orderly way.The administration would impose much tougher regulation over the vast market for financial derivatives like and other exotic instruments for hedging risk.It would also create an entirely new Consumer Financial Protection Agency, which would have broad power to regulate most forms of consumer lending.In his speech on Monday, White House officials say, Mr. Obama will step up pressure on Wall Street to accept tougher oversight. Even though his proposals have made little headway in Congress, largely because of the battle over health care, Democratic lawmakers said they were determined to pass comprehensive legislation by next year.“Big government now is the consequence of too little government before,” said Representative , chairman of the House Financial Services Committee. “What you have right now, with the government owning companies, is the result of insufficient regulation before.”On a practical level, experts say it will take years for the government to unwind some of its rescue programs.Thanks to the mortgage crisis and the collapse in housing prices, private investors have fled the mortgage market, and the federal government now finances about 9 out of 10 new home loans in the United States.The Treasury took over and , the government-sponsored finance companies that own or have guaranteed more than $5 trillion in mortgages, in the first week of September 2008. Fannie and Freddie now buy or guarantee almost two-thirds of all new mortgages. The guarantees another 25 percent.The cost of keeping the two giant companies afloat has been huge. The Treasury has provided Fannie and Freddie with $95 billion to cover losses tied to soaring default rates and losses in value on their own mortgage portfolios. Analysts predict that the companies will need considerably more in the year ahead. At the same time, the Fed is buying almost all the new mortgage-backed securities issued by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and the F.H.A. Buying up those securities drives up their price and pushes down their effective interest rates, and ultimately lowers borrowing costs to homebuyers.The scale of the Fed’s intervention has been staggering. The central bank has acquired more than $700 billion in mortgage-backed securities so far, and officials have said they will buy up to $1.25 trillion — a goal that should take the Fed until early next year. To help Fannie and Freddie raise the money they need to buy mortgages from lenders, the Fed is also buying $200 billion of their bonds.All told, the government is propping up almost the entire mortgage market and, by extension, the housing industry.As the government backs away from its rescue operations, economists and others worry about unknown consequences. Some analysts are already predicting that mortgage rates will bump higher when the Fed stops buying mortgage securities, potentially delaying a recovery in housing.But the much bigger puzzle is how the government will untangle Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, with their combustible mix of taxpayer support, public policy goals and for-profit structures.“It will be very difficult to unwind, having stepped in as big as they did,” said Howard Glaser, a senior housing official during the Clinton administration and now an industry consultant in Washington. “There is no structure, no mechanism, for private investors to come back into the market.”Other experts and policy makers have begun to raise broader concerns. Even if the Obama administration and the Fed do manage to shrink the government’s role to precrisis levels, has the government’s immense rescue simply set the stage for more frequent interventions in the future?“This crisis, whether it’s because of the Fed or the Treasury or Congress, has created a lot of new moral hazards,” said Charles I. Plosser, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia. “Once you have done this once, even though it was in a severe crisis, the temptation will be for people to figure that in the next crisis you’ll do it again. You’ve got to figure out a way to say no.”'"
"'09-09-14,'1','NEW HAVEN  It was supposed to have been Annie Le’s wedding night. But hours after the missing Yale graduate student was to have been married, investigators found a body stuffed inside a wall of the lab building where she was last seen alive on Tuesday.While the remains had yet to be officially identified, Peter Reichard, the assistant New Haven police chief, said the authorities were assuming they were of Ms. Le, 24, a slight, California-bred daughter of Vietnamese immigrants who was studying pharmacology.The discovery appeared to have ended the six-day search for Ms. Le that began with speculation of a runaway bride but quickly gave way to near certainty that a crime had been committed.Yale University’s president, Richard C. Levin, wrote in an e-mail message to students Sunday night, “Our hearts go out to Annie Le’s family, fiancé and friends, who must suffer the additional ordeal of waiting for the body to be identified.”At the elite Ivy League university’s medical school campus in the Hill section of New Haven, about half a mile from the main campus of neo-Gothic and Georgian Revival architecture, students seemed shocked and fearful Sunday night.“I’m freaked.” said Lucas Cheadle, 26, who is studying for his doctorate in neuroscience. Mr. Cheadle appeared agitated as he spoke, taking out a cigarette as he walked a few blocks from 10 Amistad Street, where the body was found. “My awareness of danger has definitely increased,” he said.The authorities have not identified any suspects, but Ms. Le’s disappearance recalled a disturbing case from December 1998: the stabbing death of Suzanne Jovin, 21, a Yale senior whose body was found in a neighborhood not far from campus; that crime remains unsolved.Ms. Le was from Placerville, Calif., a town of about 10,000 people in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada. She earned her undergraduate degree at the University of Rochester, where she met Jonathan Widawsky, a graduate student at Columbia University whose family lives on Long Island in Huntington, N.Y. They fell in love. They planned to be married on Sept. 13 at the North Ritz Club in Syosset, N.Y., a catering hall by a big pond and a gazebo, set well back from the highway. More than 160 people were set to attend.By Friday, family members had canceled the wedding.Ms. Le’s absence was first noted on Tuesday, hours after she was seen on surveillance video entering the four-story lab building at 10 Amistad Street, down the street from Yale New Haven Hospital and about 10 blocks south of the main Yale campus. A young woman, 4-foot-11 and 90 pounds, she was wearing a brown skirt and bright green T-shirt.Her purse containing her ID, cellphone and money was found in her office in another Yale building a few blocks away.Over the following days, investigators pored over hundreds of hours of video from dozens of cameras, hoping to catch a glimpse of Ms. Le.By Thursday, Yale officials said that more than 100 law enforcement officials were looking for Ms. Le. A $10,000 reward was posted for her whereabouts.Ms. Le was not naïve about her safety. In February, she wrote an article for a student magazine offering tips on how to avoid becoming the victim of a crime.“New Haven is a city, and all cities have their perils,” she wrote, “but with a little street smarts, one can avoid becoming yet another statistic.”On Saturday, the police reportedly found bloody clothes above ceiling tiles in the lab building on Amistad. Other reports said the clothes were not the same ones Ms. Le was last seen wearing.On Sunday, the search appeared to have moved to a waste-processing facility on the industrial fringe of Hartford where trash from much of New Haven, as well of the rest of the state, is burned to generate electric power. Officials did not say if they had found anything there.Joe Avery, a New Haven police spokesman, said the body “was found behind the wall in something called a chase, which is a space that carries utilities from one floor to another.”At the news conference Sunday night, Chief Reichard declined to supply more details. “We have an ongoing homicide case,” he said, “so we cannot tell you what we have, where we found anything or what it is.”On Long Island, near Mr. Widawsky’s family’s home, those who knew the couple were already mourning.“This is Annie’s bouquet,” a woman said to a television reporter earlier, proffering a sad-looking array of roses. “It’s wilting.”On Bittersweet Place in Huntington, the Widawsky family remained in seclusion. The Le family, who had traveled to New Haven, was not heard from either.Deborah Kiley of Deborah’s Hair Loft in Huntington, N.Y., was to have styled the hair of Ms. Le, her mother, Mr. Widawsky’s mother and five attendants on Sunday morning. She said she was praying for Ms. Le and her family.“I can’t even accept it right now,” Ms. Kiley said. “I never forget a soul I meet. I was going to be part of a beautiful day, which is the most important day of a girl’s life other than the day she gives birth.”'"
"'09-09-14,'1','But Peter P. Appert, who is an analyst at Piper Jaffray, argued that BusinessWeek’s future was cloudy. “I don’t think the prospect of meaningful earnings recovery is particularly good,” he said.BusinessWeek executives declined to comment for this article, as did a McGraw-Hill spokesman, Steven H. Weiss. He referred a reporter to a July news release in which McGraw-Hill said it was “exploring strategic options” for the magazine.BusinessWeek was founded in 1929 with a simple aim: to summarize the week’s business news. It soon became a handbook for managers, covering strategy, marketing and the big issues affecting business, like policy, energy and debt.Stephen J. Adler, the magazine’s editor in chief, joined in 2005 from The Wall Street Journal, where he had a variety of editing assignments, including working on the paper’s Web site, directing legal coverage and handling some investigative projects.When he joined BusinessWeek, he pushed it beyond its traditional mix of corporate coverage, adding columnists like Jack Welch and Maria Bartiromo. He also created an investigative unit that has churned out award-winning articles, and was behind this week’s cover article on accusations of corruption in the Glock gun empire.But Mr. Adler arrived when the magazine was struggling with an existential question: how do you make a weekly magazine relevant in the Internet age?As the economy weakened and advertising dropped, Mr. Adler and Keith Fox, BusinessWeek’s president, decided the magazine needed to re-establish itself as an essential publication for its core audience of business executives.In February, Mr. Adler and Mr. Fox called editorial employees into a meeting to announce a solution. The magazine would focus on what executives needed to know for their jobs, and shed its sports, lifestyle and politics articles. And writers needed to consider a businessperson’s point of view, rather than a consumer’s.“Our mission is to move business forward,” read the mission statement, handed out at the meeting, and to help readers “make smarter decisions in their businesses, careers and investments.”Some editorial employees liked the change. “We’re trying to serve business readers at a time when business is in disarray,” said one employee, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because employees are not authorized to speak publicly about the sale. “I think we’ve done remarkably well doing that.”But other employees saw a different subtext: their role now was to help business leaders make more money. Though the investigative unit has continued its work, other staff members say their harder-hitting stories have been killed, held or edited into submission.The regular feature “How to Play It,” which advises readers on profiting from articles in the issue and is often written by the reporter who wrote the article, has drawn particular ire. The Sept. 7 issue, for example, urged investing in Monsanto to benefit from population growth.As the editorial side has tried to find its footing, the business side has been slammed by the downturn. BusinessWeek was buoyed by dot-com advertisements in the late 1990s, and had more than 5,000 ad pages in 1999. Last year, it had only about 1,900 pages. Its share of the ad pages among competitors — Fortune, Forbes, Inc. and Fast Company — has fallen in the last six years.And ad revenue at the print magazine has plummeted to an estimated $60 million this year, from almost $110 million in 2006, according to the information memorandum for the BusinessWeek sale. In the same period, ad revenue from the Web site has increased only $897,000, to an estimated $20.5 million this year.The memorandum hints at why. Though BusinessWeek.com attracts a lot of page views, 45 percent of those are from slide shows, which Web publishers consider a gimmicky way to increase hits. Only 16 percent of page views came from original articles for the six months ended in April. BusinessWeek.com also pulls in just $19.28 per thousand ad views, almost a quarter lower than what it was earning three years ago. And it sells only about 38 percent of the available ads, down from 79 percent in 2006, according to the document.Some advertisers seem to be wondering whether BusinessWeek is still the best place for their money. When Intel, once a major BusinessWeek advertiser, recently hosted media partners at a mixer to talk about future projects, BusinessWeek did not merit an invitation.“Weekly publications in general have to deal with the fact that the Internet does provide current news, and that’s what the purpose of a weekly magazine started out to be,” said Petra Arbutina, executive vice president and director for contact strategy for the marketing firm Brunner.According to the information memorandum, BusinessWeek lost $17 million last year. But that does not include more than $26 million in charges like overhead and rent from McGraw-Hill. BusinessWeek argues that those charges were too high, and a new owner could set lower rent rates and reduce other charges included in that $26 million. Still, they are counted as expenses.Including such charges, BusinessWeek lost $43 million in 2008, and projects losing $41 million this year, before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization.McGraw-Hill reduced the magazine’s physical size, and in January, it announced its fourth round of layoffs in two years. This time, a quarter of the editorial staff will be cut, along with workers in other departments, for a total of 85 of BusinessWeek’s 421 jobs.Hoping to find new revenue, BusinessWeek started a social-networking site, Business Exchange, and sank $16 million into it in 2007 and 2008. One year after its introduction, the site drew just 1.5 million page views in the United States in July, according to the measurement firm comScore. That is about the same as Wikinvest.com, a start-up offering investment tips.Last year, Business Exchange had expenses of $7.6 million, and brought in only about $600,000 in revenue. The company expects that gap to narrow significantly. Still, the project is expected to cost $4.7 million this year, excluding interest and taxes.With bids about to land, investors and employees are debating the future of BusinessWeek. There are levers to move, like decreasing circulation or raising the magazine’s price. But it is still a weekly in a nanosecond world.“They have to be unique, must-read,” said Stephen B. Shepard, the editor of BusinessWeek for 20 years and now dean of the Graduate School of Journalism at the City University of New York. “That’s the only hope for almost all these publications.”'"
"'09-09-14,'1','Meanwhile, advertising revenue for magazines dropped 21 percent in the first half, and the number of ad pages sold dropped 28 percent, according to the .The blog networks that have survived the downturn in advertising and the explosion of competing content on the Web their obsessive coverage of narrow topics, along with business models that reach beyond advertising.“It’s actually really hard creating compelling content that brings an audience,” Mr. Sugar said.Hobbyist bloggers first got the idea that their online entries could be profitable in 2002 when Nick Denton, a former reporter for The Financial Times, started what would become . The catty network quickly grew into a powerhouse, and it now has eight blogs, 20 million monthly readers and more than 150 full- and part-time employees. When Jason Calacanis sold his blog network, Weblogs Inc., to for a reported $25 million in 2005, the notion that blogging could be a business was cemented.Today, blog networks range from big, like Gawker and Sugar, to smaller and more focused, like The Business Insider, VentureBeat and the GigaOm Network, which cover business and technology. There are also large networks of blogs that share ads but not editorial control, like BlogHer and Glam Media.Sugar’s blogs — with names like PopSugar (celebrity gossip), BellaSugar (beauty) and LilSugar (mothering) — are all edited and designed with 28-year-old women in mind. The writers and sales staff are fanatical about going after that ideal visitor, Mr. Sugar said. The posts are short, light and sarcasm-free, with big photos and headlines like “The Jolie-Pitts Bring the Twins to the Golden Arches” and “10 Sexy Bedhead Hairstyles to Try Today.”Other blog networks take a similarly narrow focus. Gawker Media’s business cards used to read “Unhealthily obsessed,” said Lockhart Steele, the company’s former managing editor. He follows the same motto at Curbed, a company he founded that publishes blogs on real estate, dining, shopping and travel in New York, and San Francisco.“We are completely obsessed with every square inch of the areas we cover,” Mr. Steele said. “It’s the classic blogger model: give people everything they could possibly want on a topic.” For the Curbed sites, that sometimes means two dozen posts a day just about New York real estate.That all-encompassing coverage is meant to keep readers coming back many times a day, in turn attracting advertisers.Blogs, with their unpredictable and sometimes edgy content, can be frightening to advertisers, but blog networks are less risky, said Shenan Reed, a founder of Morpheus Media, a digital marketing agency that represents brands like Louis Vuitton and L’Oréal.“When you’re dealing with a company where the editorial control is living under one roof, you feel like there’s a consistency in the message, which is what makes Sugar, Gawker and Curbed fantastically interesting to us,” Ms. Reed said.Blog networks also make it easier for advertisers, who do not have time to sift through the millions of blogs on the Web, to reach a big blog audience. For example, Morpheus ran an ad campaign for Neiman Marcus on the Sugar network in which it dressed each of the Sugar blogs’ cartoon mascots in outfits from the store, and readers could click on the clothes to buy them.Yet for Sugar, the dream of growing a large and profitable media business on advertising alone did not come true.“Outside of a few examples, I think people way overestimated the amount of ad revenue that was there for the taking for blogging as a business,” said Scott Rosenberg, author of the recent book “Say Everything: How Blogging Began, What It’s Becoming, and Why It Matters.”In 2007, Sugar, which is backed by Sequoia Capital and has 105 employees, acquired ShopStyle, an e-commerce site. Today it brings in half of Sugar’s revenue. At ShopStyle, shoppers can browse online retailers’ selections, and Sugar gets paid when they click through to a retailer or make a purchase.Sugar would not have been able to grow as it has without both sources of revenue, said Mr. Sugar, who was formerly vice president for e-commerce at J. Crew. The company plans to eventually make money selling virtual goods, too, like stilettos in a fashion game.Blog networks have also had to change the type of content they publish. Though many started by publishing links to and commentary on other Web sites’ material, there is now so much material online that they need to offer original reporting to stand out, Mr. Steele said.Each of Curbed’s sites has a full-time editor and a few freelancers, and they have started competing with local papers for scoops. Curbed often depends on readers’ tips and might publish 10 updates to an article in response to them.When Gawker blogs get exclusive content, like leaked videos, they can get more than a hundred times their typical traffic. “ pay,” Mr. Denton said.Sugar gets press passes to the Oscars and recently started producing videos about shopping and celebrities. It also developed blogging software called OnSugar. When bloggers use the software to showcase clothes and readers click to buy them, the bloggers and Sugar get a cut. Sugar plans to eventually sell ads on these blogs.“Perpetual movement is the essence of survival and prosperity online,” said Michael Moritz, the Sequoia investor who backed , and Sugar. “If online media and entertainment companies don’t improve every day, they will just wind up as the newfangled version of — bankrupt.”'"
"'09-09-14,'1','The detention is the second prominent bribery case this year involving a global company operating in China.In July, four Shanghai-based employees of the British-Australian mining giant Rio Tinto, including an Australian citizen, were detained and later formally charged with corruption and bribery.That case emerged after tense iron ore negotiations between Rio Tinto and Chinese steel makers and after Rio Tinto scrapped a deal with a big Chinese company, leading some analysts to speculate that it was partly politically motivated.Rio Tinto has strongly denied its Shanghai employees were involved in bribery or corruption. Chinese officials have insisted the case is not politically motivated.China recently stepped up an anticorruption drive that has ensnared numerous high-ranking government officials and even Huang Guangyu, a flamboyant entrepreneur listed by Forbes as the country’s second-richest man.That corruption drive, coupled with the Rio Tinto case — which initially involved allegations of stealing state secrets — has unnerved many foreign business people working in China.But even though corruption is pervasive in China, very few executives working for global companies have been detained or arrested by Chinese police. Legal experts say that is partly because investigators focus on the government officials who accept the bribes; but they also say the government is reluctant to go after foreign companies.There have been indications in China’s state-run news media, though, that investigators could begin to target multinational corporations.And many foreign companies operating here are warning employees to use extra caution because the United States Justice Department has stepped up its enforcement of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which forbids the paying of bribes to government officials to win or influence business deals.In July, Control Components, a company based in California, pleaded guilty to foreign bribery charges and agreed to pay an $18.2 million fine.The company had been accused of paying bribes to officials in more than 30 countries over many years, including to Chinese state-owned companies.In the Coca-Cola case, the National Business Daily, a Chinese state-controlled publication, reported over the weekend that the bottling plant middle manager had worked in the marketing department of the bottling company.Coca-Cola has huge operations in China, including about 38 bottling plants, and about 30,000 employees in China, and is pushing to expand aggressively here.This year, the company’s move to pay $2.4 billion to acquire one of China’s biggest juice makers, the Huiyuan Juice Group, was blocked by the Chinese government, which cited antitrust concerns.'"
"'09-09-14,'1','A giant tiled wall of jewel-toned loops and curves — one of the last commissions by the Conceptual artist Sol LeWitt — was unveiled in the 59th Street-Columbus Circle subway station by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority last week. And while its title — “Whirls and Twirls (MTA)” — may sound more like an amusement park ride than an artwork, the eye-popping palette and monumental scale are bolder than most of the art in the subways, a surprising visual jolt for the estimated 69,000 commuters who use the station every day.On a wall facing a double-wide stairway and landing at 60th Street that leads from the mezzanine to the A, B, C, D and 1 trains, “Whirls and Twirls” is made up of 250 porcelain tiles and covers a space 53 feet wide and 11 feet high.“It’s one of the largest projects we’ve ever done,” said Sandra Bloodworth, director of Arts for Transit and facilities design for the authority.It is also one of the most complex. LeWitt, who died two years ago, was known for wall drawings that involved meticulously detailed instructions to his seasoned crew. This project, a permanent installation, was his first in porcelain tile and employs the same color palette — deeply saturated tones of blue, green, yellow, orange, red and purple — that he used in his acrylic wall drawings.“It’s tough enough to match the colors in acrylics,” said Sofia LeWitt, one of the artist’s two daughters and the overseer of his estate. Since no tile makers in this country were able to replicate the exact shades LeWitt wanted, Ms. LeWitt, members of his studio and transit authority officials sought someone in Europe who could. They finally found artisans in Madrid who could make tiles with just the right color intensity.The project began five years ago as an integral part of the station’s $108 million face-lift. When authority officials approached LeWitt, they asked him to choose any site in the station. “He must have picked the wall above the staircase because it is the busiest thoroughfare,” Ms. LeWitt said.'"

"'09-09-15,'1','The Jets gathered briefly Monday afternoon at team headquarters in Florham Park, N.J., where they watched film and received treatment. Already, the questions centered on New England.For all the Jets showed Sunday, for as dominating as their defense played, for the poise exhibited by Sanchez, the Rex Ryan and Mark Sanchez era will be defined in part by how they combat the Patriots.Under Eric Mangini, the Jets mimicked New England in the way they practiced and prepared, in the way they treated injuries like state secrets, in the paranoia that pervaded the whole organization. The Jets did everything like the Patriots except produce similar results.The Jets will attempt to snap an eight-game losing streak at home against the Patriots on Sunday. But these are not the same old Jets.These are Ryan’s Jets, and since he replaced Mangini in January, Ryan has installed a new defense and a new attitude. He has also provided the Patriots with plenty of material for their bulletin board, including one juicy exchange on WFAN, in which he famously said he did not come to New York to “kiss Bill Belichick’s rings.”Belichick, of course, is the architect of the Patriots’ ballyhooed system. Without a doubt, he heard what Ryan said and filed it away under motivation.Ryan’s words will not help his pass rush reach Tom Brady, or contain Randy Moss. But so far, as evidenced against the Texans, Ryan has made the Jets a better, more confident team through words alone. Swaggerlicious, Bart Scott calls it.On Monday, Ryan said he knew two spots for sure where the Patriots were better than the Jets, those being at head coach and quarterback.“We’ll find out who has the better team,” he said.The Jets increased expectations for their season with their performance against the Texans. Sanchez proved adept at improvisation, repeatedly finding receivers on third down, with 191 of his 272 passing yards coming on that down, when the Jets needed them most. It was as if the Jets were better on third-and-long under Sanchez, Ryan said, than they were on third-and-short. Sanchez also played with poise atypical of a rookie, shaking off his interception with a 40-yard strike to Dustin Keller on the next possession. On third down, of course.“With the talent we have on this team, I know I don’t have to do everything,” Sanchez said.On Sunday, he was not alone. Ryan set the tone by deferring to the Texans after the Jets won the coin toss.He was daring his defense to dominate, even without the suspended starters Shaun Ellis and Calvin Pace. It responded with two turnovers and two sacks, and it allowed 183 yards.“It was like watching a new movie coming out,” cornerback Darrelle Revis said.The list goes on. The offensive line held the Texans without a sack and paved the path for 190 rushing yards. Running backs Thomas Jones and Leon Washington picked up where they left off last season in the Pro Bowl.Those performances were extra important because a daunting schedule looms over the next month. It starts with the Patriots and continues against Tennessee, at New Orleans and at Miami.Receiver Jerricho Cotchery said Monday that the Patriots did not like the Jets. The feeling, of course, is mutual. So neither team will look past Sunday.“I don’t think they’ll be surprised at all,” Ryan said of the Patriots. “More than anything, some of the so-called experts will be surprised, but New England won’t be. They know how we’re going to play defense.”The Jets waived CB Marquice Cole to make room for defensive end Shaun Ellis, who returns this week from suspension. ... N.F.L. Commissioner Roger Goodell expects to rule this week on the Jets’ failure to report Brett Favre’s arm injury last season.'"
"'09-09-15,'1','Not just a hobby, Foxworth’s passion for civil rights will inform his handling of the league’s coming labor negotiations, in which he will participate as a member of the union’s executive committee. He candidly, some would say audaciously, vows to speak for forgotten fans and stadium workers “who would be hurt by a lockout more than the players,” he said.Foxworth has watched the occasional interviewer stop cold when he acknowledges growing up outside Baltimore decidedly middle class. (“They’re like, ‘Where’s the strife?’, and the story mysteriously never runs,” he said.) As he tries to live his N.F.L. life far differently from the public’s image of it, speaking to middle schools and starting nonprofit charities, every now and then he grounds himself. Underground.“This is the Little Rock Nine,” Foxworth said, pointing to an autographed print of the black students who in 1957 were blocked from attending a segregated school in Arkansas. “All this stuff is really powerful to me. It motivates me. Football and community work and just day to day. To not waste.”Foxworth’s father, Lorinzo, attended an all-black elementary school in Charlotte, N.C., before joining the Army and raising two sons with his wife, Karen. In bouncing from post to post, the family made sure to tour the local university — Indiana, North Carolina, Pittsburgh, West Point. Perhaps that is why Lorinzo Foxworth, now retired and pursuing a doctorate in business training and development, speaks of his younger son’s “matriculation through life.”Lorinzo Foxworth said: “But he has a sixth sense we couldn’t impact. He always had a knack for asking the question of why? How does it work? How did it start? And it all ends with something he wants to impact, to manifest in things that matter to him.”Domonique left high school near Baltimore midway through his senior year in 2001 so he could begin classes early at the University of Maryland. He entered with an interest in computer engineering but was turned on to history and earned a degree in American studies three years later. He did so despite starring on the football team; he was then drafted by the Denver Broncos in the third round in 2005.Blocked by the Pro Bowl cornerbacks Champ Bailey and Dre’ Bly, Foxworth never developed a consistent role in Denver and was traded to the Atlanta Falcons before last season. He was so quick on man-to-man coverage that the Ravens bought him away as a free agent with a four-year contract worth a guaranteed $16.5 million, and potentially $27.2 million, to tighten what was already one of the N.F.L.’s stingiest defenses.Foxworth did not splurge on a Lamborghini. He still drives the Range Rover from his draft year. He did call Mark Mitchell, a collector and dealer of African-American memorabilia based in Fairfax, Va., to do his own kind of splurging.“Professional athletes really have an interest in African-American history, not just for themselves but to pass it along to their families,” said Mitchell, whose clients include the former Washington Redskins Art Monk and Charles Mann and the basketball player Chris Webber. “I find them very intelligent, curious. They’re almost stunned — honored, in a way, to hold in their hands a letter from Frederick Douglass. They have respect for the people who helped bring about the world they live in. You think of athletes as privileged, in a corner by themselves, but they have a curiosity that would surprise people.”Foxworth’s curiosity will help guide his own playbook for the union-league negotiations; he will be the youngest member of the players’ 11-man executive committee. He said he understood his responsibility to secure the best collective bargaining agreement for his fellow players. Yet he refuses to forget the thousands of strangers — parking attendants, restaurant owners, souvenir hawkers and more — who would be financially devastated by a prolonged lockout.“It’s not us against the league, who gets the most money — that’s pretty juvenile,” Foxworth said. “We don’t get hurt, we hurt people around us. Obviously it’ll hurt the billionaire owners a bit. It’ll hurt some players who may not get their chance for a life-changing payday. But by and large, the people that we hurt most are just regular people. I just want to introduce that there’s a third party that doesn’t have a voice. Someone needs to remind both of us that this isn’t a game.”Few people would recognize Foxworth anywhere but his native Baltimore, if there. He is only 5 feet 11 inches and 180 pounds. He avoids telling people he meets what he does for a living because of what he called “the default image that people have of football players, the default story of the life.”He added, “If I can have a regular conversation on a plane about life and general things, I would much rather do that than have him ask me what it’s like to cover Randy Moss.”Foxworth says he has no specific plans for retirement, his body tapped but his mind just reaching stride. Get a doctorate or two, he said. Maybe build recreation centers with academic bents. Keep adding to his museum, which he considers less hobby than homage. He wants a Medgar Evers piece. Bobby Kennedy.Too bad the walls will never include one long-lost item that Foxworth’s father still recalls. When Domonique was 8, just starting Pop Warner football, he walked into his parents’ bedroom with a shockingly good picture he had drawn. It wasn’t Junior Seau or Jerry Rice. It was a parachute.'"
"'09-09-15,'1','“I see Roger, he is a gentleman player, I have many things to learn from him,” del Potro said later.In this first five-set final in a decade, Federer made 15 unforced errors in the final set to del Potro’s 4. Maybe Federer, the five-time champion, was worn down after helping care for his twins, born July 23, although Kim Clijsters had looked pretty spry during her two-week joy ride, in the company of her 18-month-old daughter.This match was better than fans might have expected when del Potro dispatched an obviously wounded Rafael Nadal in the semifinals on Sunday — and then apologized, sort of.Instead of the compact and energetic Nadal on the traditionally charged Sunday afternoon, the Open got del Potro on a weekday, but he brought his Argentine fans with him, just enough people shouting soccer chants and waving the Argentine flag to give the place some energy.The last five-setter was in 1999, when Andre Agassi won his second Open, this one over Todd Martin, whose name is not often associated with five-set final thrills.Del Potro, who is 6 feet 6 inches tall — five inches taller than Federer — gave the crowd some hope in the second set when he temporarily figured out Federer’s softer game.“With Roger, the best player in history, I have nothing to lose,” del Potro said.By the third set, Federer was reduced to a terse exchange with the chair umpire, even dropping a rather routine expletive in the middle of it, although nothing of the Serena Williams level.In the fourth set, Federer had to negotiate the right to make a challenge, which he won — a rare success at challenges for him — only to lose the set. Late in the fourth, Federer could barely get around for what should have been a routine forehand against the challenger.“I’ve had a wonderful year and I’m still No. 1,” Federer said later, while praising del Potro.Del Potro’s upset and his pleasant demeanor upgraded the men’s tournament, but the two-week Open still belonged to Clijsters, the Belgian player who returned from a two-year hiatus to start a family and marched through assorted Williamses before beating Caroline Wozniacki in the final Sunday night.Clijsters’s championship will last longer than the unpleasant memory of Serena Williams’s profane bluster at a lineswoman Saturday night. After extremely tepid expressions in the first two days, Williams released another statement Monday, in which she apologized to the lineswoman, Clijsters, the United States Tennis Association and “mostly tennis fans everywhere for my inappropriate outburst.”She called herself “a woman of great pride, faith and integrity, and I admit when I’m wrong.”“I need to make it clear to all young people that I handled myself inappropriately and it’s not the way to act — win or lose, good call or bad call in any sport, in any manner,” she said. She added that she hoped to learn and become “a better person as a result.”On Monday, the Williams sisters beat Cara Black of Zimbabwe and Liezel Huber of the United States, 6-2, 6-2, for the doubles championship. Then the sisters gave an obligatory post-match conference, during which Serena revealed to reporters that “most of all I am a very sincere person. I wanted to offer my sincere apologies to anyone that I may have offended.”Asked about the lineswoman whom she had cursed and offered to force a tennis ball down her throat, Williams laughed and said she would like to give the woman a big hug. There has been no word whether the lineswoman is up for that. Besides, the tournament is over. Everybody can get some rest, particularly Roger Federer, older than he has ever been.'"
"'09-09-15,'1','The United Nations General Assembly voted Monday to create a new, more powerful agency for women, in a move supporters hailed as a breakthrough for women’s equality and rights. An Assembly resolution called for the amalgamation of four existing United Nations offices dealing with women’s affairs into a single body to be headed by an under secretary general. The unanimous vote followed three years of negotiations.'"
"'09-09-15,'1','For nearly two sets, it appeared that Federer would continue surfing the wave of his own creation. For nearly two sets, he was serving below par but was in command once the ball was in play: reading the flow of the rallies beautifully, slicing precise backhands, ripping forehands and using his panoply of tactical options to befuddle the dangerous, more inexperienced del Potro, who looked tight and bothered by the reality of playing his first major final in the large stadium that had long made him dream from afar.“This is my favorite tournament,” del Potro has often said: an original thought for an Argentine whose Grand Slam allegiances traditionally drift across the Atlantic to the French Open and its red clay surface.But in a summer when so much had gone right for Federer on both a private and professional level, adding the crowning touch would prove too much to ask against his taller, more mechanical opponent. Until now, the only man to beat Federer in a Grand Slam final was Rafael Nadal, but del Potro was the Spanish speaker wearing the bandanna and sleeveless shirt across the net this time after sweeping past Nadal in straight sets in Sunday’s semifinals.“You deserve it,” Federer told del Potro when he reached up to shake hands Monday night.“Of course I would have loved to win, but I’ve had an unbelievable run here,” Federer said later to the crowd. “I would never have thought five or six years ago, I would win 40 matches in a row here.”Serving for a two-set lead at 5-4, Federer went up 30-0 only to drop the next four points, with del Potro benefiting from a correct challenge at 30-30 that left the skeptical Federer shouting, “No way.” Del Potro would soon even the match at one set apiece.If Federer does not choose to continue playing, as planned until the 2012 Summer Olympics, the electronic line calling system just might be the culprit. It irks him more than his opponents’ winners. He was against its implementation and has been one of the least effective of the top players in making use of it, and he got uncharacteristically surly late in the third set when he felt del Potro took too long to challenge.Leading by 5-4, Federer became testy with the chair umpire Jake Garner during the changeover. Federer, a hothead in his youth, has long been a remarkably well-mannered champion, but he used an expletive after snapping: “Don’t tell me to be quiet, O.K.? When I want to talk, I talk.”Federer later said the incident had not been a distraction. “You know what I think,” he said of the system. “It shouldn’t be there in the first place.”But Federer, unlike Serena Williams on Saturday night, did not let his frustration descend into physically threatening an official. Instead, he regained his composure and won the third set on consecutive double faults from del Potro. Only then did Federer gradually lose his edge and his title, as his consistency dipped in the final two sets and del Potro began generating gasps from the crowd of more than 23,000 by clubbing forehands for winners on a regular basis. Midway through the fourth set, del Potro hit a forehand winner and slapped hands with fans.Men’s tennis now has another shot to add to its greatest hits list, but del Potro’s huge serve and two-handed backhand are also effective. The racket looks small in his hands. “He played a great match; he will win many more,” said Vilas, who was in the stands.As del Potro dictated terms in the final set, it was hard not to flash back to the last match he and Federer played on a hardcourt and marvel at how quickly 20-year-old tennis players can scale the heights.In the quarterfinals of the Australian Open, del Potro won just three games in three sets as Federer steamrolled him, leaving the Argentine dazed and searching for his words. But by the French Open, Federer already needed five sets to shake free of him on clay in the semifinals.That was his sixth victory in sixth attempts against del Potro, but the Argentine was clearly gaining in capacity and confidence, and now he has his first major title after his first final: just as Federer did when he won Wimbledon in 2003 at age 21.“It’s always an amazing effort coming through and winning your first in your first final,” Federer said. “You have to give him all the credit, because it’s not an easy thing to do, especially coming out against someone like me who has so much experience.”Federer, now 28, had not lost a match at the United States Open since 2003, when he was beaten by a grouchier Argentine, David Nalbandian, in the fourth round. Since then, Federer has swept through five editions of this tournament, beating five different opponents in the final without ever being pushed to five sets.Along the way, he has grown into the most successful player of the Open era, establishing a new career record of 15 Grand Slam singles titles by winning Wimbledon in July. Later that month, his new wife Mirka Vavrinec gave birth to twin girls.But his dream summer had a downbeat ending. The fault was partly with his serve (he put only 50 percent of his first serves into play) and partly with the opposition. As at Wimbledon in 2008, when his winning streak was stopped by Nadal, Federer could not make it past five in a row at Flushing Meadows.""Six would have been a dream, but you can’t have them all,"" Federer said.'"
"'09-09-15,'1','The administration of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu also weighed in, but its views on groups like Human Rights Watch were already clear. Mr. Netanyahu’s policy director, Ron Dermer, told The Jerusalem Post in July, “We are going to dedicate time and manpower to combating these groups; we are not going to be sitting ducks in a pond for the human rights groups to shoot at us with impunity.”After the report about Mr. Garlasco came out, Mr. Dermer called it “perhaps a new low.”At first, Human Rights Watch, a global organization with headquarters in New York, issued an unequivocal statement of support for Mr. Garlasco, saying he “has never held or expressed Nazi or anti-Semitic views.”Ms. Bogert at the time said his work has been “extensively reviewed, lawyered, scrutinized, pulverized by our program and legal staff, and we have not in six years ever had cause to question his professional judgment.”Mr. Garlasco, who worked at the Pentagon helping to target bombs in the second Persian Gulf war, has since traveled the world for Human Rights Watch, investigating and writing reports of the alleged use of white phosphorus munitions in Gaza, cluster munitions in Russia and Georgia, and other military practices in Iraq, Afghanistan and Lebanon.Ms. Bogert called the attacks on Mr. Garlasco and her group “a distraction from the real issue, which is the Israeli government’s behavior.”But some who firmly support Human Rights Watch were left unsettled by the researcher’s extracurricular activities.Helena Cobban, a blogger and activist who is on the group’s Middle East advisory committee, asked on her blog, Just World News, if Mr. Garlasco’s activities were “something an employer like Human Rights Watch ought to be worried about? After consideration, I say Yes.”Other groups say they have felt more heat from the Israeli government and its allies. “Recently we have seen a new attitude, a stepping up,” said Sari Michaeli, press officer for the group B’Tselem, which recently came under harsh criticism from the Israeli military for a report that concluded that civilians made up more than half of the Palestinian casualties in the Gaza offensive.Mr. Garlasco declined to be interviewed. But on Friday he posted an essay with the Huffington Post in which he called the Nazis “the worst war criminals of all time,” explaining that he was simply a “military geek” whose interest grew out of his own family’s history.“I’ve never hidden my hobby, because there’s nothing shameful in it, however weird it might seem to those who aren’t fascinated by military history,” he wrote. “Precisely because it’s so obvious that the Nazis were evil, I never realized that other people, including friends and colleagues, might wonder why I care about these things.”Yaron Ezrahi, a professor of political science at Hebrew University in Jerusalem, said he did not believe that Mr. Garlasco’s interest in memorabilia could support allegations of “premeditated bias.” He said, however, that Human Rights Watch’s credibility might have been wounded because Mr. Garlasco’s hobby “has armed the right-wing fanatics” who “work day and night to demonize any individual or organization that raises questions about the military practices of Israel when they end up even with unintended civilian casualties.”And that is one thing that seems to especially trouble Ms. Cobban, who said in an interview that the controversy played into the hands of the government and its helpers in the fight.“They have been given this deus ex machina gift,” she said, “about the discovery of Garlasco and his out-of-hours hobby.”'"
"'09-09-15,'1','ANKARA, Turkey (Reuters) — Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Monday denied suggestions that a $2.5 billion fine imposed on Turkey’s biggest media company was part of an attempt to put pressure on the country’s opposition media.The record fine, which was handed down last week, has raised concern among critics that the government was seeking to bankrupt the company, Yayin, for coverage that some officials view as hostile, including reports of alleged corruption and accusations that the governing party is trying to introduce Islam into public life — a breach of secular constitutional principles.Mr. Erdogan’s governing party, with a large parliamentary majority, has extended its influence widely in the state apparatus and reduced the political power of the secularist military.“I have no thoughts of applying political or economic pressure on the media, but certain media establishments have no right to see themselves above the law,” Mr. Erdogan told ambassadors at a dinner.The European Commission condemned the fine on Thursday and said it could affect the next annual progress report on Turkey’s bid to enter the European Union.'"
"'09-09-15,'1','At the start of school, Ms. Avery gathered her staff to tell them it would be one of the most difficult years they would face. This year, the school will have 29 students to a class, instead of 21, four fewer teachers and fewer incentives for students, such as free bicycles.In a back-to-school slideshow, Ms. Avery told teachers they might be asked to take on multiple jobs. She suggested they scour advertisements for supplies and post cheap finds in the teachers’ lounge, and urged them to hold grant-writing get-togethers.“Don’t hoard, share,” she listed as mantra No. 1 in her presentation.In Queens, Cindy Diaz-Burgos, who is beginning her sixth year as principal of M.S. 189, said it would be difficult to keep students on track academically with such severe cuts. Her budget was trimmed by about $285,000, and in August she discovered her school would lose at least $65,000 more from the state because it no longer qualified as a low-performing school needing extra support.“It’s like being diabetic,” she said. “The doctor gives you medication and your levels are good, and then he suddenly decides to take you off. We need all the money we can get.”In light of the reductions, Ms. Diaz-Burgos decided to eliminate an after-school program of tutoring in English, math, science and social studies. She has also ended a volleyball program that had attracted 90 students before breakfast, and students will be expected to pay for their own hand sanitizer and tissues to protect against swine flu.Citywide, principals made most of the reductions by eliminating teaching positions (36 percent of the cuts) or reducing spending on equipment, supplies and books (28 percent), according to the Department of Education. Some schools also reduced spending on substitutes and overtime pay for teachers.Teachers whose positions are eliminated are not laid off but instead are placed in a reserve pool and serve as substitutes. Chancellor Joel I. Klein has urged principals to use the reserve pool to fill openings rather than hiring from outside the system, because the teachers in the pool are already drawing full pay.Education officials said they did not expect spending on arts programs, which makes up about 3 percent of the total budget, to decrease disproportionately because of the cuts.But Richard Kessler, executive director of the Center for Arts Education, said he had received complaints from “many, many quarters” that schools were disproportionately trimming arts supply budgets and eliminating part-time arts educators.Ernest A. Logan, president of the Council of School Supervisors and Administrators, the city’s principals’ union, said the cuts had led local organizations to fill the gaps. For instance, at Public School 86 in Brooklyn, he said, a local church provided free backpacks filled with supplies to students. Parents had pushed the Department of Education to allow the continued hiring school aides paid with P.T.A. funds as a way to keep school staffs robust and won that battle. “We’re really looking at the community to pick up some of the slack,” Mr. Logan said. “And the community is coming forward.”It is not the first time in recent years that schools have had to cut spending. In 2008, school budgets were cut by 1 percent in January, followed by another 1 percent in November. Most city agencies have endured similar cuts, because of the sluggish economy.Federal stimulus dollars helped offset some of this year’s cut, but not enough to eliminate it entirely.“The stimulus is wonderful and it is great and it has saved jobs and programs, but we can’t kid ourselves,” said Photeine Anagnostopoulos, chief operating officer for the Education Department, saying that half the school districts in the country were in a similar position. “It didn’t cover everything.”Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, who gained control of city schools in 2002, has made it a priority to give principals more power over their schools. Principals now have control over much of their spending, as well as the power to hire teachers and choose vendors for academic programs.Ms. Avery said it was important to share that power in a time of crisis, adding that she had consulted teachers in deciding what to cut so they would all have ownership over the decisions.“We know that we’re not the only ones who are going through this,” she said. “The entire country is going through this. Nobody said this job was going to be easy, and it’s still not easy.”'"
"'09-09-15,'1','With Primary Day, New Yorkers finally catch a break. Their mailboxes will no longer be clogged  until the next time, anyway  with clumps of mailings that politicians and all too many political writers call “campaign literature.”Most dictionaries regard literature as a somewhat loftier pursuit than the hounding of the citizenry. A typical main definition of the word is this from Merriam-Webster’s Desk Dictionary: “The production of written works having excellence of form or expression and dealing with ideas of permanent interest.”Now look at the political flier in your mailbox. Is there anything about its form or expression that smacks of excellence, or a single idea that is likely to hold your interest permanently?This season’s campaign literature has clung for the most part to oxymoronic tradition, although some of it has been eye-grabbing. More on that later.First, consider the significance of a Sept. 15 primary. Exactly one year ago, the Dow Jones industrial average tanked, losing more than 500 points and sending the country into its economic tailspin. Tuesday’s elections are the first for major local offices to be held since then.A lot has been written about the financial import of the anniversary. Little has been said about how the Wall Street crisis altered the nature of democracy in New York City.A year ago, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg was frustrated. He was not going to be president or vice president. Presiding over a foundation to dole out some of his billions didn’t get his juices flowing. For months, he had explored ways to run a third time for mayor.Standing in his way, however, was this pesky thing called a term-limits law, twice approved by New Yorkers in referendums. It limited him and other major officeholders to two terms. Mr. Bloomberg himself used to love the two-term limit. More than once, he described it as ideal  until it got in his way.Sept. 15, 2008, provided the game changer for New York democracy.The financial turmoil gave the mayor cover (You can’t let me go in this crisis  I’m too valuable) to override the will of the people. He got the City Council speaker, Christine C. Quinn, to go along. That wasn’t too hard. Ms. Quinn’s own political ambition, to become the next mayor, had withered as the result of a money scandal that enveloped the Council.Narrowly, by a vote of 29 to 22, the Council gave her what she and the mayor wanted, extending term limits for four more years. How powerful a motivator was self-interest? Of the 29 who voted for the extension, 23 would have been forced out of office this year. They gave themselves a way to cling to their Council seats.In alphabetical order, they were:Maria Baez, Leroy G. Comrie Jr., Erik Martin Dilan, Simcha Felder, Lewis A. Fidler, Helen D. Foster, Alan J. Gerson, Robert Jackson, Melinda R. Katz, G. Oliver Koppell, Miguel Martinez, Michael C. Nelson and Ms. Quinn. Also, Domenic M. Recchia Jr., Diana Reyna, Joel Rivera, James Sanders Jr., Larry B. Seabrook, Helen Sears, Kendall Stewart, Peter F. Vallone Jr., Albert Vann and David Yassky.Ms. Katz and Mr. Yassky have since switched gears; both are running for city comptroller. Mr. Martinez probably would have sought re-election had he not been forced to resign as an admitted crook.SO we have situations that would not have been possible a year ago, like an irony-free statement last week from the candidate Mr. Bloomberg on how to improve the functioning of democracy in New York.And we have all that fine literature in our mailboxes.In fairness, some of it has nothing to do with term limits. That concept certainly never applied to Robert M. Morgenthau, who some suspect has been Manhattan’s district attorney since the days of New Amsterdam. The hot race to succeed him has produced some of the more eye-catching mailings.Leslie Crocker Snyder beats up Cyrus R. Vance Jr. for having left Manhattan years ago in favor of, eeeww, Seattle. The third candidate in that race, Richard M. Aborn, says in an advertisement that he “spent 30 years taking guns out of the hands of criminals.” Directly beneath that is a photo of former Vice President Dick Cheney holding a vintage rifle. Cheney. Criminal. Get it?But the end is at hand. For literature, we will simply have to be content with all those bank promotions and mailers for phony-baloney sweepstakes.'"
"'09-09-15,'1','Home Depot will begin selling a line of home improvement and other products in January featuring the Martha Stewart brand, the companies said on Monday.Martha Stewart Omnimedia and Home Depot declined to reveal any financial terms or specify the duration of the agreement.Robin Marino, Martha Stewart’s co-chief executive and the president for merchandising, said the agreement was for a long term and that it had the potential to become the company’s largest in terms of retail sales.The arrangement begins in January 2010, the same time that a Martha Stewart retail merchandising deal with Kmart ends, Ms. Marino said.“We plan to be extremely aggressive at marketing these new businesses,” she said. “The Home Depot has made a very strong commitment that will be instrumental in supporting this program.”The companies will sell products in the outdoor living category, like patio furniture, in January, said Gordon Erickson, senior vice president for merchandising at Home Depot. Later, they will sell home décor and organization items, including a new closet organization system.'"
"'09-09-15,'1','I’M a frequent flier, and have been for years. I fly regularly to Pittsburgh, Birmingham, Denver, Baltimore, Nashville and occasionally, Jacksonville.They aren’t the most glamorous destinations, but that’s where the business is.Last year, I traveled twice to Istanbul to visit a Turkish customer. For me, it was a real adventure.I don’t mind all the security precautions nowadays. I’m actually grateful for the increased restrictions since I can no longer carry water samples with me. Clients now have to ship them to us.Water samples from our clients are very important. That’s because water differs from place to place, even street to street. So our chemists need to adjust formulas to better match the local water supply.On one trip to Baltimore about 15 years ago, I had to go to a hardware store to purchase a container to carry back a gallon of water. The only “container” this particular hardware store had was a gasoline can. I purchased it along with a plain cardboard box that fit the can.Airport security wanted to see what was in the box. I explained carefully what it contained, what my role was with the company and what was in the gas can. It still caused quite a stir and several security officers came over to take a look.After I convinced them it was only water, I was still told to go to the nearest bathroom and dump it in the sink, and then throw away the container.I found a bathroom and began to empty the can into the sink. Then, a gentleman walked into the bathroom and saw me pouring the contents of the gas can into that sink. He got very startled and left quickly.After I was done pouring out the water, I then tried to throw the gasoline container into the nearby garbage can.But it was a tad too large and I had to really push it hard to get it into the garbage can.At that moment, a man walked in with his son and they both stopped in their tracks when they saw what I was doing. The man grabbed his son’s arm and they practically ran out of the bathroom.I figured it was time for me to stop what I was doing, and I left for my gate, just as the final boarding call was made. I was the last person on the plane.I looked back and saw several state troopers head into the bathroom. I was so relieved when the plane door closed and we took off. I escaped.Obviously, trying something like this nowadays would be illegal and stupid. But 15 years ago, things were much different. It didn’t seem like a big deal, even though it probably was.If I was lucky, sometimes all I had to carry was a bottle of water. Back then, the security personnel would just want to smell the liquid in the bottle, as though that would be telling. But one time I had to drink a sip of water from a sample bottle. I guess they figured if I didn’t pass out, it was O.K. So I took a big sip of the water. And they let me through.No one followed me to see if I took an antidote.Recently on a trip to Baltimore, a friend had a container of crabmeat confiscated at security. I have to laugh. I once had to carry a steel sample, shaped like a sickle, on board a plane. Since it was a small airport, the security agent had the pilot take a look at it. The pilot didn’t have an issue and let me right on.I think he might have even given me a big thumbs up.'"
"'09-09-15,'1','One World Symphony has performed many premieres since its founding in 2001 by the composer and conductor Sung Jin Hong. Oneworldsymphony.org, its Web site, states that it performs new music “that is accessible, in which composers compose for the ‘people’ instead of their colleagues in academia.”Mr. Hong’s “From the Alchemist,” which the orchestra performed on Sunday at the Ansche Chesed Synagogue on the Upper West Side, is certainly accessible. Inspired by the novel “The Alchemist” by Paulo Coelho, it was composed for One World Symphony to perform at Mr. Hong’s wedding to the mezzo-soprano Adrienne Metzinger. A lushly neo-Romantic work, it quotes the Adagietto of Mahler’s Fifth Symphony and sounds as if it were written before a Mahlerian altar.The concert — a benefit for the orchestra’s Community Music Program, which offers discounted tickets to underprivileged children and their parents — opened with Emilia Tamburri’s effective arrangement of Bjork’s “New World,” used in the film “Dancer in the Dark.” This version featured AfterShock, a five-man a cappella group whose singers replicated the sonic effects of the original.Also on the lineup was a lithe rendition of Mendelssohn’s concert overture “The Hebrides,” which Mr. Hong prefaced with brief comments about composers who were inspired by water, playing a few bars of the overture to highlight the most evocative passages. In the Mendelssohn and in Vaughan Williams’s bleak one-act opera “Riders to the Sea,” which came next, the woodwinds were the strongest section of the orchestra.Vaughan Williams’s work, based on the play by the Irish author J. M. Synge, tells the story of Maurya, a widow who has lost her husband and four of her six sons to the sea. During the opera she learns that the body of Michael, a missing son, has been discovered; then Bartley, her last surviving son, also dies.Dina Gulnara Mitzanova offered a moving performance as Maurya, and Katharine Gunnink and Anne Marie Schubert sang expressively as Cathleen and Nora, the two daughters.'"
"'09-09-15,'1','LONDON — One of Dubai’s most prominent investment funds is in talks with its bankers about refinancing its swollen debt burden after a steep fall in the value of its assets.Istithmar, the investment arm of the government-owned Dubai World conglomerate, has frozen its investment activity and laid off about 20 percent of its staff as it struggles to extract itself from a mountain of debt, according to a person briefed on its strategic plans. Analysts say the figure could well exceed $6 billion, a figure that in all likelihood is more than the equity value of the fund’s beaten-down investment portfolio.The fund does not disclose its size, but as of April 2007, it had invested $3.5 billion. About $10 billion in debt was added — a valuation that represented a high point.The fund’s predicament is an embarrassing turn of events for it, as well as for Istithmar’s chief executive, David Jackson. It also underscores the extent to which highly leveraged companies, as well as countries, remain at risk despite the recent recovery in world markets.Set up in 2003, Istithmar came to be seen as the public face of a brash, acquisitive Dubai, which, unlike more conservative sovereign funds operating in the region, deployed high levels of leverage to finance a shopping spree that included the Queen Elizabeth 2 luxury liner; the department store Barneys New York; a stake in Cirque du Soleil, from Montreal; as well as luxury hotels in New York like the W on Union Square and the Mandarin Oriental on Columbus Circle.'"
"'09-09-15,'1','Mint.com, a start-up whose Web site helps people organize their money, rolled into some cash of its own on Monday, selling out to the personal finance giant Intuit for $170 million.Companies like Intuit that sell boxed software have been struggling to gain their footing on the Web as free, online financial start-ups like Mint, SmartyPig and Wesabe have surged in popularity for their simplicity and ease of use, said Emmett Higdon, a senior analyst with Forrester Research who specializes in the online banking industry.Intuit is the maker of widely used financial software applications like TurboTax and Quicken.“Quicken seems like something your dad uses,” Mr. Higdon said. Younger, Web-savvy users “aren’t likely to sit down nightly and enter in a bunch of financial information online,” he said. “These sites appeal to the iPhone audience.”In June, Microsoft discontinued sales of its boxed finance software, Microsoft Money Plus, but consumers can still find many similar functions on Microsoft’s MSN Money Web site. It is a clear indication that online personal-finance sites are starting to have an impact, said Stessa Cohen, research analyst at Gartner Research.Mint, which unveiled its free online services in September 2007, quickly became popular as more people turned to the Web to create budgets and manage their finances. The company says it has 1.5 million users tracking nearly $50 billion in assets and $200 billion in transactions.'"
"'09-09-15,'1','In Africa, more than 90 percent of children with sickle-cell anemia die before their illness is diagnosed.A new study, published last week in the British journal Lancet, showed that invasive bacteria were an important cause of those children’s deaths and that many of the bacteria were the same kinds that affect children in wealthy countries, which have vaccines against them.Those findings suggest that new antibacterial vaccines used in the wealthy world could save the lives of many African children, the authors wrote. (Old vaccines against measles, mumps and polio are cheap, but newer antibacterial ones like Hib and Prevnar are usually much more expensive, limiting their use in poor countries.)Researchers also said that using antibiotics among these children as a preventive measure, which is controversial because of fears of creating antibiotic resistance, could save lives.Researchers took blood from more than 38,000 children admitted to one hospital in Kenya and screened it for both bacterial infection and sickle-cell anemia. They found that children with sickle-cell anemia developed a severe infection about six times as often as children without.The study was sponsored by the Wellcome Trust, a leading British foundation focusing on third-world health.'"
"'09-09-15,'1','Symphony Space is presenting its first New York Chamber Music Festival, a six-concert series that began on Sunday afternoon with Principal Brass, a quintet (four principals and one associate principal) from the New York Philharmonic.The program was fairly light: at the end of the concert, Philip Smith, the orchestra’s principal trumpeter and the chatty master of ceremonies here, saluted the Canadian Brass for transforming quintet performances into entertainment, and added his hope that this Philharmonic ensemble had done so as well. There was no visible sign of dissent from Mr. Smith’s colleagues, Matthew Muckey, the associate principal trumpeter; Philip Myers, the hornist; Joseph Alessi, the trombonist; and Alan Baer, the tuba player.To that end, the group devoted its program mostly to transcriptions — Baroque favorites, jazz tunes and movements from Leonard Bernstein’s “West Side Story” — with a couple of pieces composed for brass tucked into the first half like stowaways.Not surprisingly, those scores worked best. The Intermezzo from Ingolf Dahl’s “Music for Brass Instruments” (1944) was given a bright-hued, energetic performance, and the fast movements of Malcolm Arnold’s first Quintet (1961) sizzled. The Chaconne at the heart of the Arnold was striking in a different way: in this slow movement the players were alert to the dynamic nuances and produced a finely balanced sound.They did so in some of the transcriptions too. “America,” from the “West Side Story” set, in a Jack Gale arrangement, was dazzling enough that you didn’t think much about the original orchestration. An Albinoni sonata, arranged by David Hickman, and the Sarabande from Bach’s Partita No. 1 for Unaccompanied Violin, in a transcription by Donald Rauschen, had a quirky appeal in brass timbres too.Others went less smoothly. The Bourée from the same Bach Partita and a movement from Handel’s “Royal Fireworks Music” (arranged by Chuck Seipp) had rhythmically flat-footed moments. And neither superb trumpet dialogues nor character-ful trombone playing was enough to save some of the jazz arrangements (most by Robert Elkjer) from seeming to plod rather than swing.'"
"'09-09-15,'1','This raises the intriguing possibility that the problem with praise isn’t that it is done the wrong way — or handed out too easily, as social conservatives insist. Rather, it might be just another method of control, analogous to punishment. The primary message of all types of conditional parenting is that children must earn a parent’s love. A steady diet of that, Rogers warned, and children might eventually need a therapist to provide the unconditional acceptance they didn’t get when it counted.But was Rogers right? Before we toss out mainstream discipline, it would be nice to have some evidence. And now we do.In 2004, two Israeli researchers, Avi Assor and Guy Roth, joined Edward L. Deci, a leading American expert on the psychology of motivation, in asking more than 100 college students whether the love they had received from their parents had seemed to depend on whether they had succeeded in school, practiced hard for sports, been considerate toward others or suppressed emotions like anger and fear.It turned out that children who received conditional approval were indeed somewhat more likely to act as the parent wanted. But compliance came at a steep price. First, these children tended to resent and dislike their parents. Second, they were apt to say that the way they acted was often due more to a “strong internal pressure” than to “a real sense of choice.” Moreover, their happiness after succeeding at something was usually short-lived, and they often felt guilty or ashamed.In a companion study, Dr. Assor and his colleagues interviewed mothers of grown children. With this generation, too, conditional parenting proved damaging. Those mothers who, as children, sensed that they were loved only when they lived up to their parents’ expectations now felt less worthy as adults. Yet despite the negative effects, these mothers were more likely to use conditional affection with their own children.This July, the same researchers, now joined by two of Dr. Deci’s colleagues at the University of Rochester, published two replications and extensions of the 2004 study. This time the subjects were ninth graders, and this time giving more approval when children did what parents wanted was carefully distinguished from giving less when they did not.The studies found that both positive and negative conditional parenting were harmful, but in slightly different ways. The positive kind sometimes succeeded in getting children to work harder on academic tasks, but at the cost of unhealthy feelings of “internal compulsion.” Negative conditional parenting didn’t even work in the short run; it just increased the teenagers’ negative feelings about their parents.What these and other studies tell us, if we’re able to hear the news, is that praising children for doing something right isn’t a meaningful alternative to pulling back or punishing when they do something wrong. Both are examples of conditional parenting, and both are counterproductive.The child psychologist Bruno Bettelheim, who readily acknowledged that the version of negative conditional parenting known as time-out can cause “deep feelings of anxiety,” nevertheless endorsed it for that very reason. “When our words are not enough,” he said, “the threat of the withdrawal of our love and affection is the only sound method to impress on him that he had better conform to our request.”But the data suggest that love withdrawal isn’t particularly effective at getting compliance, much less at promoting moral development. Even if we did succeed in making children obey us, though — say, by using positive reinforcement — is obedience worth the possible long-term psychological harm? Should parental love be used as a tool for controlling children?Deeper issues also underlie a different sort of criticism. Albert Bandura, the father of the branch of psychology known as social learning theory, declared that unconditional love “would make children directionless and quite unlovable” — an assertion entirely unsupported by empirical studies. The idea that children accepted for who they are would lack direction or appeal is most informative for what it tells us about the dark view of human nature held by those who issue such warnings.In practice, according to an impressive collection of data by Dr. Deci and others, unconditional acceptance by parents as well as teachers should be accompanied by “autonomy support”: explaining reasons for requests, maximizing opportunities for the child to participate in making decisions, being encouraging without manipulating, and actively imagining how things look from the child’s point of view.The last of these features is important with respect to unconditional parenting itself. Most of us would protest that of course we love our children without any strings attached. But what counts is how things look from the perspective of the children — whether they feel just as loved when they mess up or fall short.Rogers didn’t say so, but I’ll bet he would have been glad to see less demand for skillful therapists if that meant more people were growing into adulthood having already felt unconditionally accepted.'"
"'09-09-15,'1','Women who take drugs like raloxifene or tamoxifen can reduce their risk of developing invasive breast cancer by up to half, but they may be at greater risk for potentially serious blood clots, according to a new paper that reviews the risks and benefits of the drugs.For every 1,000 women who take the medications each year, 7 to 10 fewer cases of breast cancer will develop, researchers said.But both medications increase the risk of blood clots, with the highest risk for tamoxifen: for every 1,000 women who take tamoxifen each year, four to seven additional cases of blood clots occur, according to the study, which appears this week in Annals of Internal Medicine.Tamoxifen also increases the risk of endometrial cancer and cataracts.A third drug, tibolone, which is not approved in the United States but is used elsewhere, was included in the study. It significantly reduces breast cancer risk but increases the risk of strokes in older women, the paper reported.And all three drugs reduce the risk of fractures.The paper assessed the risks and benefits of the drugs when used by healthy women who have never had breast cancer but are considered at greater risk for the disease.Most of the data analyzed by the study was drawn from eight large clinical trials.'"
"'09-09-15,'1','And the recovery plan is providing help to the unemployed and tax relief for working families, all while spurring consumer spending. It’s prevented layoffs of tens of thousands of teachers, police officers, and other essential public servants. And thousands of recovery projects are underway all across America, putting people to work building wind turbines and solar panels, renovating schools and hospitals, and repairing our nation’s roads and bridges.Eight months later, the work of recovery continues. And although I will never be satisfied while people are out of work and our financial system is weakened, we can be confident that the storms of the past two years are beginning to break.In fact, while there continues to be a need for government involvement to stabilize the financial system, that necessity is waning. After months in which public dollars were flowing into our financial system, we are finally beginning to see money flowing back to the taxpayers. This doesn’t mean taxpayers will escape the worst financial crisis in decades unscathed. But banks have repaid more than $70 billion, and in those cases where the government’s stake has been sold completely, taxpayers have actually earned a 17-percent return on their investment. Just a few months ago, many experts from across the ideological spectrum feared that ensuring financial stability would require even more tax dollars. Instead, we’ve been able to eliminate a $250 billion reserve included in our budget because that fear has not been realized.While full recovery of the financial system will take a great deal more time and work, the growing stability resulting from these interventions means we are beginning to return to normalcy. But what I want to emphasize is this: normalcy cannot lead to complacency.Unfortunately, there are some in the financial industry who are misreading this moment. Instead of learning the lessons of Lehman and the crisis from which we are still recovering, they are choosing to ignore them. They do so not just at their own peril, but at our nation’s. So I want them to hear my words: We will not go back to the days of reckless behavior and unchecked excess at the heart of this crisis, where too many were motivated only by the appetite for quick kills and bloated bonuses. Those on Wall Street cannot resume taking risks without regard for consequences, and expect that next time, American taxpayers will be there to break their fall.That’s why we need strong rules of the road to guard against the kind of systemic risks we have seen. And we have a responsibility to write and enforce these rules to protect consumers of financial products, taxpayers, and our economy as a whole. Yes, they must be developed in a way that does not stifle innovation and enterprise. And we want to work with the financial industry to achieve that end. But the old ways that led to this crisis cannot stand. And to the extent that some have so readily returned to them underscores the need for change and change now. History cannot be allowed to repeat itself.Instead, we are calling on the financial industry to join us in a constructive effort to update the rules and regulatory structure to meet the challenges of this new century. That is what my administration seeks to do. We have sought ideas and input from industry leaders, policy experts, academics, consumer advocates, and the broader public. And we’ve worked closely with leaders in the Senate and House, including Senators Chris Dodd and Richard Shelby, and Congressman Barney Frank, who are now working to pass regulatory reform through Congress.Taken together, we are proposing the most ambitious overhaul of the financial system since the Great Depression. But I want to emphasize that these reforms are rooted in a simple principle: we ought to set clear rules of the road that promote transparency and accountability. That’s how we’ll make certain that markets foster responsibility, not recklessness, and reward those who compete honestly and vigorously within the system, instead of those who try to game the system.First, we’re proposing new rules to protect consumers and a new Consumer Financial Protection Agency to enforce those rules. This crisis was not just the result of decisions made by the mightiest of financial firms. It was also the result of decisions made by ordinary Americans to open credit cards and take on mortgages. And while there were many who took out loans they knew they couldn’t afford, there were also millions of Americans who signed contracts they didn’t fully understand offered by lenders who didn’t always tell the truth.This is in part because there is no single agency charged with making sure it doesn’t happen. That is what we’ll change. The Consumer Financial Protection Agency will have the power to ensure that consumers get information that is clear and concise, and to prevent the worst kinds of abuses. Consumers shouldn’t have to worry about loan contracts designed to be unintelligible, hidden fees attached to their mortgages, and financial penalties — whether through a credit card or debit card — that appear without warning on their statements. And responsible lenders, including community banks, doing the right thing shouldn’t have to worry about ruinous competition from unregulated competitors.Now there are those who are suggesting that somehow this will restrict the choices available to consumers. Nothing could be further from the truth. The lack of clear rules in the past meant we had innovation of the wrong kind: the firm that could make its products look best by doing the best job of hiding the real costs won. For example, we had “teaser” rates on credit cards and mortgages that lured people in and then surprised them with big rate increases. By setting ground rules, we’ll increase the kind of competition that actually provides people better and greater choices, as companies compete to offer the best product, not the one that’s most complex or confusing.Second, we’ve got to close the loopholes that were at the heart of the crisis. Where there were gaps in the rules, regulators lacked the authority to take action. Where there were overlaps, regulators often lacked accountability for inaction. These weaknesses in oversight engendered systematic, and systemic, abuse.Under existing rules, some companies can actually shop for the regulator of their choice — and others, like hedge funds, can operate outside of the regulatory system altogether. We’ve seen the development of financial instruments, like derivatives and credit default swaps, without anyone examining the risks or regulating all of the players. And we’ve seen lenders profit by providing loans to borrowers who they knew would never repay, because the lender offloaded the loan and the consequences to someone else. Those who refuse to game the system are at a disadvantage.Now, one of the main reasons this crisis could take place is that many agencies and regulators were responsible for oversight of individual financial firms and their subsidiaries, but no one was responsible for protecting the whole system. In other words, regulators were charged with seeing the trees, but not the forest. And even then, some firms that posed a “systemic risk” were not regulated as strongly as others, exploiting loopholes in the system to take on greater risk with less scrutiny. As a result, the failure of one firm threatened the viability of many others. We were facing one of the largest financial crises in history and those responsible for oversight were caught off guard and without the authority to act.That’s why we’ll create clear accountability and responsibility for regulating large financial firms that pose a systemic risk. While holding the Federal Reserve fully accountable for regulation of the largest, most interconnected firms, we’ll create an oversight council to bring together regulators from across markets to share information, to identify gaps in regulation, and to tackle issues that don’t fit neatly into an organizational chart. We’ll also require these financial firms to meet stronger capital and liquidity requirements and observe greater constraints on their risky behavior. That’s one of the lessons of the past year. The only way to avoid a crisis of this magnitude is to ensure that large firms can’t take risks that threaten our entire financial system, and to make sure they have the resources to weather even the worst of economic storms.Even as we’ve proposed safeguards to make the failure of large and interconnected firms less likely, we’ve also proposed creating what’s called “resolution authority” in the event that such a failure happens and poses a threat to the stability of the financial system. This is intended to put an end to the idea that some firms are “too big to fail.” For a market to function, those who invest and lend in that market must believe that their money is actually at risk. And the system as a whole isn’t safe until it is safe from the failure of any individual institution.If a bank approaches insolvency, we have a process through the FDIC that protects depositors and maintains confidence in the banking system. This process was created during the Great Depression when the failure of one bank led to runs on other banks, which in turn threatened the banking system. And it works. Yet we don’t have any kind of process in place to contain the failure of a Lehman Brothers or AIG or any of the largest and most interconnected financial firms in our country.That’s why, when this crisis began, crucial decisions about what would happen to some of the world’s biggest companies — companies employing tens of thousands of people and holding trillions of dollars in assets — took place in hurried discussions in the middle of the night. And that’s why we’ve had to rely on taxpayer dollars. The only resolution authority we currently have that would prevent a financial meltdown involved tapping the Federal Reserve or the federal treasury. With so much at stake, we should not be forced to choose between allowing a company to fall into a rapid and chaotic dissolution that threatens the economy and innocent people, or forcing taxpayers to foot the bill. Our plan would put the cost of a firm’s failure on those who own its stock and loaned it money. And if taxpayers ever have to step in again to prevent a second Great Depression, the financial industry will have to pay the taxpayer back — every cent.Finally, we need to close the gaps that exist not just within this country but among countries. The United States is leading a coordinated response to promote recovery and to restore prosperity among both the world’s largest economies and the world’s fastest growing economies. At a summit in London in April, leaders agreed to work together in an unprecedented way to spur global demand but also to address the underlying problems that caused such a deep and lasting global recession. This work will continue next week in Pittsburgh when I convene the G20, which has proven to be an effective forum for coordinating policies among key developed and emerging economies and one that I see taking on an important role in the future.Essential to this effort is reforming what’s broken in the global financial system — a system that links economies and spreads both rewards and risks. For we know that abuses in financial markets anywhere can have an impact everywhere; and just as gaps in domestic regulation lead to a race to the bottom, so too do gaps in regulation around the world. Instead, we need a global race to the top, including stronger capital standards, as I’ve called for today. As the United States is aggressively reforming our regulatory system, we will be working to ensure that the rest of the world does the same.A healthy economy in the 21st Century also depends upon our ability to buy and sell goods in markets across the globe. And make no mistake, this administration is committed to pursuing expanded trade and new trade agreements. It is absolutely essential to our economic future. But no trading system will work if we fail to enforce our trade agreements. So when, as happened this weekend, we invoke provisions of existing agreements, we do so not to be provocative or to promote self-defeating protectionism. We do so because enforcing trade agreements is part and parcel of maintaining an open and free trading system.And just as we have to live up to our responsibilities on trade, we have to live up to our responsibilities on financial reform as well. I have urged leaders in Congress to pass regulatory reform this year and both Congressman Frank and Senator Dodd, who are leading this effort, have made it clear that that’s what they intend to do. Now there will be those who defend the status quo. There will be those who argue we should do less or nothing at all. But to them I’d say only this: do you believe that the absence of sound regulation one year ago was good for the financial system? Do you believe the resulting decline in markets and wealth and employment was good for the economy? Or the American people?I’ve always been a strong believer in the power of the free market. I believe that jobs are best created not by government, but by businesses and entrepreneurs willing to take a risk on a good idea. I believe that the role of government is not to disparage wealth, but to expand its reach; not to stifle markets, but to provide the ground rules and level playing field that helps to make them more vibrant — and that will allow us to better tap the creative and innovative potential of our people. For we know that it is the dynamism of our people that has been the source of America’s progress and prosperity.So I certainly did not run for President to bail out banks or intervene in the capital markets. But it is important to note that the very absence of common-sense regulations able to keep up with a fast-paced financial sector is what created the need for that extraordinary intervention. The lack of sensible rules of the road, so often opposed by those who claim to speak for the free market, led to a rescue far more intrusive than anything any of us, Democrat or Republican, progressive or conservative, would have proposed or predicted.At the same time, what we must do now goes beyond just these reforms. For what took place one year ago was not merely a failure of regulation or legislation; it was not merely a failure of oversight or foresight. It was a failure of responsibility that allowed Washington to become a place where problems — including structural problems in our financial system — were ignored rather than solved. It was a failure of responsibility that led homebuyers and derivative traders alike to take reckless risks they couldn’t afford. It was a collective failure of responsibility in Washington, on Wall Street, and across America that led to the near-collapse of our financial system one year ago.Restoring a willingness to take responsibility — even when it is hard — is at the heart of what we must do. Here on Wall Street, you have a responsibility. The reforms I’ve laid out will pass and these changes will become law. But one of the most important ways to rebuild the system stronger than before is to rebuild trust stronger than before — and you do not have to wait for a new law to do that. You don’t have to wait to use plain language in your dealings with consumers. You don’t have to wait to put the 2009 bonuses of your senior executives up for a shareholder vote. You don’t have to wait for a law to overhaul your pay system so that folks are rewarded for long-term performance instead of short-term gains.The fact is, many of the firms that are now returning to prosperity owe a debt to the American people. Though they were not the cause of the crisis, American taxpayers through their government took extraordinary action to stabilize the financial industry. They shouldered the burden of the bailout and they are still bearing the burden of the fallout — in lost jobs, lost homes and lost opportunities. It is neither right nor responsible after you’ve recovered with the help of your government to shirk your obligation to the goal of wider recovery, a more stable system, and a more broadly shared prosperity.So I want to urge you to demonstrate that you take this obligation to heart. To put greater effort into helping families who need their mortgages modified under my administration’s homeownership plan. To help small business owners who desperately need loans and who are bearing the brunt of the decline in available credit. To help communities that would benefit from the financing you could provide, or the community development institutions you could support. To come up with creative approaches to improve financial education and to bring banking to those who live and work entirely outside the banking system. And, of course, to embrace serious financial reform, not fight it.Just as we are asking the private sector to think about the long term, Washington must as well. When my administration came through the door, we not only faced a financial crisis and costly recession, we also found waiting a trillion-dollar deficit. Yes, we have had to take extraordinary action in the wake of an extraordinary economic crisis. But I am committed to putting this nation on a sound and secure fiscal footing. That’s why we’re pushing to restore pay-as-you-go rules, because I will not go along with the old Washington ways which said it was OK to pass spending bills and tax cuts without a plan to pay for it. That’s why we’re cutting programs that don’t work or are out of date. And that’s why I’ve insisted that health insurance reform not add a dime to the deficit, now or in the future.There are those who would suggest that we must choose between markets unfettered by even the most modest of regulations — and markets weighed down by onerous regulations that suppress the spirit of enterprise and innovation. But if there is one lesson we can learn from the last year, it is that this is a false choice. Common-sense rules of the road do not hinder the markets but make them stronger. Indeed, they are essential to ensuring that our markets function, and function fairly and freely.One year ago, we saw in stark relief how markets can err; how a lack of common-sense rules can lead to excess and abuse; how close we can come to the brink. One year later, it is incumbent on us to put in place those reforms that will prevent this kind of crisis from ever happening again; that reflect the painful but important lessons we’ve learned; and that will help us move from a period of recklessness and crisis to one of responsibility and prosperity. That is what we must do. And I’m confident that is what we will do.'"

"'09-09-16,'1','BOSTON — The Massachusetts secretary of state’s office is investigating whether a top aide to Mayor Thomas M. Menino improperly deleted months’ worth of e-mail, an inquiry that gives Mr. Menino’s opponents in next week’s mayoral primary new ammunition in their uphill race to unseat him.William F. Galvin, the secretary of state, said Tuesday that he had ordered Mr. Menino’s office to hire an independent forensics expert to help recover the missing e-mail from computers at City Hall and to turn it over by Sept. 25. At that point, Mr. Galvin said, he will decide whether to ask state prosecutors for a criminal investigation.“Our goal is to try to resolve this in a noncriminal way if possible,” Mr. Galvin said in an interview. “The best thing the city can do is to promptly find the e-mails and turn them over to us and, going forward, to have a system in place to make sure this cannot happen again.”Under state law, e-mail messages are public records that municipal employees are required to save for at least two years, even if the contents are of “no informational or evidential value.”The investigation began after The Boston Globe reported Sunday that it had submitted a public records request for six months’ worth of e-mail to and from Michael J. Kineavy, Mr. Menino’s chief of policy and planning, but that the Menino administration could find only 18 e-mail messages sent or received by Mr. Kineavy during that period.Dot Joyce, Mr. Menino’s spokeswoman, said that in responding to The Globe’s request, city officials had found that most of Mr. Kineavy’s electronic correspondence had been inadvertently lost because of a glitch in the city’s e-mail system. Mr. Kineavy deleted e-mail from his own computer every night under the mistaken impression that the system was saving backup copies, said Ms. Joyce, who added that the city had now corrected the glitch.'"
"'09-09-16,'1','Pettitte said his shoulder felt achy in the last two innings of his five-inning, 103-pitch outing Friday in a 10-4 loss to Baltimore. He lacked command and his cutter was flat, and he told the Yankees about his condition.Pettitte has learned how to pitch through elbow trouble. But he never had shoulder issues until last season, and said he was not as resourceful with that type of discomfort.Girardi said that Pettitte did not have a magnetic resonance imaging exam but that he passed all the tests performed by trainers. Even so, any hint of a physical problem with Pettitte is bound to undermine some of the Yankees’ confidence.The Yankees hold a six-game lead over the Angels for the best record in the American League, but for all of their success, they have questions about their rotation.C. C. Sabathia has been dominant, although he has pitched poorly in the playoffs for other teams the last two seasons. A.J. Burnett has a 6.14 earned run average in his last nine starts and has never pitched in the postseason. Joba Chamberlain is on a strict innings limit, although he has recently shown signs of correcting a mechanical flaw.“He will be a full-fledged starter,” Girardi said of Chamberlain. “I don’t want to say we’re in the playoffs, but he will be a full-fledged starter by the end.”The other starters are Sergio Mitre, who started Tuesday against Toronto, and Chad Gaudin, who will replace Pettitte on Wednesday. Neither would seem to be a serious candidate to start in the postseason.Pettitte is 13-6 with a 4.14 E.R.A. in 29 starts this season. He has earned about $3.5 million in bonuses relating to innings pitched and time on the active roster. Pettitte has thrown 178 1/3 innings; at each 10-inning level from 180 to 210 innings, he will earn an additional $750,000.The most important innings, Pettitte knows, come in October. He said he would take it easy until then so he could be strong when it mattered most.“I really did not want to skip a start,” Pettitte said. “But I definitely don’t want to be standing on a mound in a postseason game with my arm aching a little bit.”START AND FINISH IN BOSTON Major League Baseball released the tentative 2010 schedule, and it came with a quirk for the Yankees. They will not visit Fenway Park in June, July, August or September.The Yankees open the season in Boston with three games, April 5 to 8. They close the season there, Oct. 1 to 3. The only other series at Fenway is May 7 to 9.The Yankees have opened and closed the season at Fenway twice before, in 1938 and in 1950. The Red Sox come to New York in May, August and September.The Yankees’ interleague opponents will be Philadelphia and Houston at home and Arizona and the Los Angeles Dodgers on the road, in addition to home (June 18 to 20) and away (May 21 to 23) series with the Mets.The Dodgers remain the only National League team not to have visited the Bronx for interleague play — but, of course, a World Series meeting is possible.The Yankees’ home opener is April 13 against the Los Angeles Angels.'"
"'09-09-16,'1','But there was another important reason: more than half of the building may remain vacant. Russell Investments, a subsidiary of Northwestern Mutual, will occupy part of the building — a company spokeswoman would not say how much — and the seller, JPMorgan Chase, which acquired the building last year in its takeover of Washington Mutual, will retain several floors, a bank spokeswoman said.When the real estate market was hot, investors coveted space that was vacant, or would soon be vacant, because rents were steadily rising. But now, vacancy detracts from the value of a building. “In the past, the more vacancy a building had, the more valuable it was, because rents were on the move upward,” said Douglas L. Harmon, a senior managing director of Eastdil Secured of New York. “Now when you have vacancy, it applies downward pressure on values.”Mr. Harmon advised Deutsche Bank on its recent $590.3 million sale of Worldwide Plaza, a Midtown Manhattan building with 1.6 million square feet, which had been surrendered to the bank by the real estate investor Harry B. Macklowe. Mr. Macklowe had valued the building, which is on Eighth Avenue between 49th and 50th Streets, at $1.9 billion, or $1,000 a square foot, when he bought it in February 2007.By the time it was sold to a joint venture led by George Comfort & Sons, the building’s value had dropped to $369 a square foot. About 781,000 square feet are empty, according to CoStar, a research company in Bethesda, Md., including 600,000 square feet recently vacated by the advertising and public relations company Ogilvy & Mather.The owners of One California Plaza, a 42-story building at 300 South Grand Avenue in Los Angeles, are also taking a haircut because of vacant space. The building is in contract to be sold to a New York company, Metropolitan Real Estate Investment, for roughly $225 million, or about $225 a square foot, according to Real Capital Analytics, a research company. The seller is Macquarie Office Trust, an Australian company, which paid $325 a foot for an 80 percent stake in the building in 2006. One-fifth of the building is unfilled, and a major tenant, the law firm of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom, has not decided whether to renew leases that are expiring in a couple of years.“Investors today are very hesitant to make a mistake by underwriting improvement, decreasing vacancy or increasing rent,” said Scott A. Singer, the executive vice president of the Singer & Bassuk Organization, a New York company that arranges financing for transactions.Vacant floors force a new owner to spend much more money, and not just on marketing the space. The lobby may require sprucing up to attract tenants, for example. The space may sit vacant for a long time. “It could take one year, or it could take three years,” said H. Carl Muhlstein, an executive vice president in Los Angeles for Cushman & Wakefield.To clinch a deal, the landlord must offer concessions like months of free rent and help in creating or refurbishing the offices.“We’re seeing the largest concession packages I’ve seen in the last 25 years,” said Mary Ann Tighe, the chief executive of the New York region for CB Richard Ellis. “When you’re calculating what it costs to buy something, concession packages have to be part of that calculation.”Additional expenses will be accrued in converting a building that was designed for one tenant, like the Washington Mutual Center in Seattle, to multitenant use, said Robert M. White Jr., the president of Real Capital Analytics.Robert Von Ancken, the senior appraiser for Grubb & Ellis in New York, estimated that well-leased Midtown Manhattan buildings that were commanding $800 to $1,000 a square foot in 2007 had declined by at least $300 a square foot. Substantial vacancies inflict an additional decline in values of as much as 30 percent, he said.In Lower Manhattan, a fully occupied building with high-quality tenants would be priced at $300 to $400 a square foot, while one with significant vacancies would fetch $200 a square foot or less, he said. “We’re back to where we were in 2003 to 2004,” Mr. Von Ancken said. He said it takes $750 a square foot to build in Manhattan, including “soft” costs like insurance.In August, Young Woo & Associates, a New York company, and Kumho Investment Bank of Korea completed their purchase of two vacant buildings in Lower Manhattan, at 70 Pine Street and 72 Wall Street, that had previously been occupied by the insurer American International Group. The price was about $150 million, or around $100 a square foot. The new owners plan to convert the buildings to residential use.By contrast, SL Green Realty Corporation recently agreed to sell a 49.5 percent stake in a 31-story building at 485 Lexington Avenue, between 46th and 47th Streets, to a joint venture involving Optibase, an Israeli video company, and Gilmor, a Nigerian engineering company, for $504.2 million, or $547 a square foot.The building is not only almost fully leased to well-known companies like Travelers Insurance, but when loans are hard to get, it also has long-term financing at a low interest rate, said Howard L. Michaels, the chairman of the Carlton Group, an investment bank that brought in the overseas investors. “That’s like getting the last helicopter out of Saigon,” he said. “It doesn’t exist anymore.”Joel Coren, a senior director at CB Richard Ellis Global Property Advisors, who advised Deka Immobilien, a German fund, on its purchase of 1999 K in Washington, said foreign investors are now looking for properties that they can keep for a long time. “That’s really how real estate should be treated — as a long-term asset,” he said. “We had sort of lost that.”'"

"'09-09-16,'1','People who have lost their jobs are struggling terribly to find new ones. Since the downturn began in 2007, companies have been extremely reluctant to hire new workers, and few new companies have started. The economy and the job market are churning very slowly.“There are thousands of people applying for every job I’m looking at,” Rick Alexander, an unemployed master carpenter in , told my colleague . “And potential employers won’t even give me the courtesy of acknowledging I applied.” Almost five million of the officially unemployed — those still looking for work — have now been out of work for 27 weeks or longer. In the six decades that the Labor Department has been keeping records, that group has never been a larger share of the work force than it is today.Yet there is a flip side to the lack of churn. Instead of doing lots of firing and some hiring, many companies have done only some firing and virtually no hiring, the statistics show. And that isn’t all bad.Try thinking of it this way: All of the unemployed people in the country are gathered in a huge gymnasium that’s been turned into a job search center. The fact that this recession is the worst in a generation means that there are many, many people in the gym. The fact that the economy is churning so slowly means that there is not much traffic into and out of the gym.If you’re inside, you will have a hard time getting out. Yet if you’re lucky enough to be outside the gym, you will probably be able to stay there. The consequences of a job loss are terribly high, but — given that the unemployment rate is almost 10 percent — the odds of job loss are surprisingly low.The reasons for the slow churn are obviously complex. The baby boomers are moving out of the ages at which people typically start businesses. The economy has shifted away from sectors, like manufacturing, in which temporary layoffs are common. Educational gains have slowed, which affects innovation. And the federal government was not willing, at least until recently, to make the kind of that spurred entrepreneurship in the past — building the highway system, supporting scientific research, creating the Pentagon computer network that turned into the Internet.But whatever the causes, the effects of the slow churn are clear: the pain of this recession has been concentrated. That’s all the more true now that wages may be rising again.The story about falling wages was — and remains — a reasonable one.“There’s been a huge shift in power in recent years from labor to capital,” as the astute financial blogger Felix Salmon has written. Labor unions have shrunk, and companies can move operations to lower-wage countries. “Now that workers have lost their negotiating leverage,” Mr. Salmon wrote after FedEx made its announcement, “we might start seeing more across-the-board pay cuts.” If the economy were to weaken again, we still might.So far, though, we haven’t. Between the collapse of last September and this June, the average weekly pay of rank-and-file workers (who make up 80 percent of the work force) remained stuck at about $612. Hourly pay rose a bit, but the increase was canceled out by a shrinking workweek. Since June — with the economy apparently starting to grow again, as noted on Tuesday — the workweek has grown and hourly pay growth has accelerated. Last month, average weekly pay rose to $618.Most companies have evidently decided that pay cuts aren’t worth the downside. Economists refer to this phenomenon as the sticky-wage theory, and it seems to have survived the Great Recession.The theory holds that executives of companies don’t cut pay, even when demand for labor has fallen. They worry that employees will become less motivated or start looking for another job, says Laury Sejen, who oversees the compensation consultants at Watson Wyatt. So companies instead lay off workers or stop hiring. They concentrate the pain.The added wrinkle in this recession is that inflation has dropped below zero, thanks largely to a sharp fall in energy prices. In most recessions, inflation remains positive — indeed, higher than wage growth, which means that inflation-adjusted pay declines. In this recession, average prices have fallen 2 percent over the past year, while weekly pay has either been flat or risen 1 percent, depending on which data you believe.So inflation-adjusted pay is up 2 to 3 percent. Amazingly enough, that’s almost as big as the peak increases during the late 1990s boom.I realize how strange this sounds. (I work at one of the companies that did cut pay.) House values have sunk, and accounts remain battered. In the years leading up to the recession, pay increases for most families were meager. The reported last week that median real household income — which, of course, includes households that have suffered a job loss — was lower last year than a full decade earlier.But we’re still in unusual territory. The economy is just emerging from a severe recession, yet the pay of most workers has been rising. That wasn’t the case at the end of any other recent recession.I hope you can keep this in mind if you’re one of those fortunate enough to be outside the metaphorical gymnasium and still working. The economy surely doesn’t feel healthy right now. But just imagine how it feels to everybody who has borne the brunt of the recession.'"
"'09-09-16,'1','TORONTO — Authorities in Iran have arrested at least seven children and grandchildren of senior clerics in the religious city of Qum and threatened to arrest the son of Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, the powerful cleric and a former president, in what appeared to be fresh pressure on religious leaders who sympathize with the opposition.The arrests, reported by several opposition Web sites on Tuesday but apparently carried out on Monday, coincided with a harsh rebuke of Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, from a senior cleric who is an outspoken dissident, Grand Ayatollah Hossein Ali Montazeri, who urged colleagues to support the opposition movement.Ayatollah Khamenei has the final say on state matters and has issued fierce warnings against Iranians who have challenged the June 12 election, which the incumbent, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, officially won by a landslide.The opposition, which includes Mr. Ahmadinejad’s two main challengers in the election, Mehdi Karroubi and Mir Hussein Moussavi, has called the election a fraud and has sharply criticized the government’s violent suppression of postelection protests.The latest arrests appeared to be part of efforts to intimidate senior clerics and silence the younger generation in Qum who have been instrumental in reporting the use of violence in the capital, Tehran, and other large cities to traditional clerics. Such clerics ordinarily pay little attention to the news and some were unaware of the events.'"
"'09-09-16,'1','Automakers had complained that they faced a thicket of varying rules that were almost impossible to meet. The Obama compromise was endorsed by all the major auto companies, state officials and most environmental advocates.Addressing autoworkers at a plant in Lordstown, , Mr. Obama said on Tuesday that the new rules would benefit manufacturers, workers and consumers.“For too long,” Mr. Obama said, “our auto companies faced uncertain and conflicting fuel economy standards. That made it difficult for you to plan down the road. That’s why, today, we are launching — for the first time in history — a new national standard aimed at both increasing gas mileage and decreasing greenhouse gas pollution for all new cars and trucks sold in America.“This action will give our auto companies some long-overdue clarity, stability and predictability.”, the administrator of the , which along with the Department of Transportation will enforce the new rules, said at a White House briefing, “The new standards are aggressive and achievable, and ensure that consumers have a full range of vehicle choices.”In addition to providing domestic and foreign auto manufacturers with a single national efficiency standard, the proposed rules allow them to continue to build and import all classes of vehicles, from the smallest gas-electric hybrids to monster S.U.V.’s. The mileage standard varies by vehicle size, but companies will have to achieve a fleet average of 35.5 miles a gallon in combined city and highway driving.The regulations say that car companies can meet the new standards largely by using existing technologies.“These include improvements to engines, transmissions and tires; increased use of start-stop technology; improvements in air-conditioning systems (to the extent currently allowed by law); increased use of hybrid and other advanced technologies; and the initial commercialization of and plug-in hybrids,” the proposed regulations state.Manufacturers can also claim credits toward the standards by selling so-called flexible-fuel vehicles capable of running on a combination of gasoline and ethanol, and by selling more efficient cars in California and in other states that planned to adopt its stringent rules. If all those tactics are fully employed, the standard comes down by 1 to 1.5 miles a gallon by 2016, according to analysts for environmental groups.Automakers that sell fewer than 400,000 vehicles in the United States would be allowed to meet a weaker standard to keep per-unit costs down. This group includes Mercedes-Benz, , and Subaru.The United States Chamber of Commerce and a group of automobile dealers have already indicated their intent to challenge the rules in court, saying the E.P.A. does not have authority to allow California to set its own emissions standards for vehicles. (The national program essentially ratifies one approved by California in 2004.) But the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, the trade group representing most domestic and foreign car makers, endorsed it.'"
"'09-09-16,'1','“The general view of forecasters is that growth in 2010 will be moderate, less than you might expect given the depth of the recession,” Mr. Bernanke said, because of several issues, including continuing financial and credit problems, deleveraging by households and the need to end the economic stimulus programs. All these elements will “make the 2010 recovery moderate, in particular not much faster than the underlying growth rate of the economy,” he added.Business cycles are officially dated by a committee of economists at the National Bureau of Economic Research. The committee often spends many months sifting through economic trends before declaring the beginning and end dates of a recession. The latest recession began 12 months before it was officially declared in December 2008 by the committee.For policy makers in Washington, a more significant question than the actual date of the end of the current recession will be when to begin unwinding the myriad lending and guarantee programs that were hastily created in response to the crisis. Officials at the Federal Reserve have already begun to consider the question.Mr. Bernanke and other officials, including the Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner, have warned that removing the programs too early could lead to another round of problems. Historians now generally agree that, during the Great Depression, the early withdrawal of government programs in the 1930s led to deeper economic problems throughout that decade.On the other hand, some analysts have warned that waiting too long could fuel significant price increases and lead to a return of corrosive levels of inflation.The unwinding of the various spending programs and lower-interest rate policies of the Fed is not likely to be popular because, among other things, it could increase the cost of borrowing. That also threatens to increase the borrowing costs for the federal government, which already faces record deficits. And policy makers will have to confront decisions on retrenching government lending and spending programs just as lawmakers are facing midterm elections next year.In his speech, a version of which he has made before, Mr. Bernanke defended the decisions by the central bank and other policy makers throughout the crisis and said that any hesitation in taking the emergency steps that were ultimately pursued by the Fed, the federal government and foreign powers could have led to a far steeper economic decline.“Without these speedy and forceful actions, last October’s panic would likely have continued to intensify, more major financial firms would have failed, and the entire global financial system would have been at serious risk,” Mr. Bernanke said. “We cannot know for sure what the economic effects of these events would have been, but what we know about the effects of financial crises suggests that the resulting global downturn could have been extraordinarily deep and protracted.”'"
"'09-09-16,'1','For weeks, many of Wall Street’s hopeful voices have been calling the end of the recession. And when the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, said the same was “very likely” on Tuesday, his comment helped stock markets rise to highs for the year.The Dow Jones industrial average gained 56.61 points, or 0.59 percent, to close at 9,683.41, while the broader Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index was up 0.31 percent or 3.29 points, to 1,052.63. The Nasdaq was 0.52 percent, or 10.86 points, higher, at 2,102.64.Shares of basic-materials producers led the markets as commodities surged. Prices of oil and copper rose, and gold settled at $1,007.55 an ounce.During questions after a speech in Washington, Mr. Bernanke said that “the recession is very likely over at this point,” but warned that the economy would feel weak for some time as unemployment hovers at high levels.Mr. Bernanke’s measured outlook reflected concerns among investors, who wonder whether the market can continue adding to recent gains if the economy is running only at half-speed.'"
"'09-09-16,'1','BRUSSELS (AP) — The Intel Corporation, the computer chip maker, is claiming in court documents that European Union regulators made serious mistakes in levying a record fine of 1.06 billion euros ($1.45 billion) last May on a charge of illegally restricting a competitor.In a legal plea published Tuesday in the European Union’s Official Journal, Intel is asking a European Union court to overturn the antitrust decision or reduce the “manifestly disproportionate” fine.It claims that the European Commission did not supply enough proof to back up accusations that Intel had used unfair sales tactics in the computer chip market to squeeze out a Silicon Valley rival, Advanced Micro Devices, the No. 2 supplier of microprocessors to PC makers.The European Union ordered Intel to stop illegal sales tactics such as rebates to the computer manufacturers Acer, Dell, Hewlett-Packard, the Lenovo Group and the NEC Corporation for buying all or most of their chips from Intel and paying them to stop or delay A.M.D.-based computers.Intel says regulators are mistaken to judge these discounts as illegal without checking if they had actually shut A.M.D. out of the market and had “immediate, substantial, direct and foreseeable effects” on sales to European customers.The company says A.M.D. increased market share and profit during part of the 2002-7 period and that A.M.D.’s “own shortcomings” were to blame for poor sales in some markets or with some computer manufacturers.Intel also claims that its rights were violated because regulators had not granted the company a second hearing to dispute charges in July 2008 and had not allowed Intel to see documents A.M.D. gave to the European Union executive.'"

"'09-09-17,'0','These changes in the threat as well as our capabilities and technologies underscore the need for an adaptable architecture. This architecture is responsive to the current threat, but could also incorporate relevant technologies quickly and cost-effectively to respond to evolving threats. Accordingly, the Department of Defense has developed a four-phased, adaptive approach for missile defense in Europe. While further advances of technology or future changes in the threat could modify the details or timing of later phases, current plans call for the following:· Phase One (in the 2011 timeframe) – Deploy current and proven missile defense systems available in the next two years, including the sea-based Aegis Weapon System, the SM-3 interceptor (Block IA), and sensors such as the forward-based Army Navy/Transportable Radar Surveillance system (AN/TPY-2), to address regional ballistic missile threats to Europe and our deployed personnel and their families;· Phase Two (in the 2015 timeframe) – After appropriate testing, deploy a more capable version of the SM-3 interceptor (Block IB) in both sea- and land-based configurations, and more advanced sensors, to expand the defended area against short- and medium-range missile threats;· Phase Three (in the 2018 timeframe) – After development and testing are complete, deploy the more advanced SM-3 Block IIA variant currently under development, to counter short-, medium-, and intermediate-range missile threats; and· Phase Four (in the 2020 timeframe) – After development and testing are complete, deploy the SM-3 Block IIB to help better cope with medium- and intermediate-range missiles and the potential future ICBM threat to the United States.Throughout all four phases, the United States also will be testing and updating a range of approaches for improving our sensors for missile defense. The new distributed interceptor and sensor architecture also does not require a single, large, fixed European radar that was to be located in the Czech Republic; this approach also uses different interceptor technology than the previous program, removing the need for a single field of 10 ground-based interceptors in Poland. Therefore, the Secretary of Defense recommended that the United States no longer plan to move forward with that architecture.The Czech Republic and Poland, as close, strategic and steadfast Allies of the United States, will be central to our continued consultations with NATO Allies on our defense against the growing ballistic missile threat.The phased, adaptive approach for missile defense in Europe:· Sustains U.S. homeland defense against long-range ballistic missile threats. The deployment of an advanced version of the SM-3 interceptor in Phase Four of the approach would augment existing ground-based interceptors located in Alaska and California, which provide for the defense of the homeland against a potential ICBM threat.· Speeds protection of U.S. deployed forces, civilian personnel, and their accompanying families against the near-term missile threat from Iran. We would deploy current and proven technology by roughly 2011 – about six or seven years earlier than the previous plan – to help defend the regions in Europe most vulnerable to the Iranian short- and medium-range ballistic missile threat.· Ensures and enhances the protection of the territory and populations of all NATO Allies, in concert with their missile defense capabilities, against the current and growing ballistic missile threat. Starting in 2011, the phased, adaptive approach would systematically increase the defended area as the threat is expected to grow. In the 2018 timeframe, all of Europe could be protected by our collective missile defense architecture.· Deploys proven capabilities and technologies to meet current threats. SM-3 (Block 1A) interceptors are deployed on Aegis ships today, and more advanced versions are in various stages of development. Over the past four years, we have conducted a number of tests of the SM-3 IA, and it was the interceptor used in the successful engagement of a decaying satellite in February 2008. Testing in 2008 showed that sensors we plan to field bring significant capabilities to the architecture, and additional, planned research and development over the next few years offers the potential for more diverse and more capable sensors.· Provides flexibility to upgrade and adjust the architecture, and to do so in a cost-effective manner, as the threat evolves. Because of the lower per-interceptor costs and mobility of key elements of the architecture, we will be better postured to adapt this set of defenses to any changes in threat.We will work with our Allies to integrate this architecture with NATO members' missile defense capabilities, as well as with the emerging NATO command and control network that is under development. One benefit of the phased, adaptive approach is that there is a high degree of flexibility – in addition to sea-based assets, there are many potential locations for the architecture's land-based elements, some of which will be re-locatable. We plan to deploy elements in northern and southern Europe and will be consulting closely at NATO with Allies on the specific deployment options.We also welcome Russian cooperation to bring its missile defense capabilities into a broader defense of our common strategic interests. We have repeatedly made clear to Russia that missile defense in Europe poses no threat to its strategic deterrent. Rather, the purpose is to strengthen defenses against the growing Iranian missile threat. There is no substitute for Iran complying with its international obligations regarding its nuclear program. But ballistic missile defenses will address the threat from Iran's ballistic missile programs, and diminish the coercive influence that Iran hopes to gain by continuing to develop these destabilizing capabilities.Through the ongoing Department of Defense ballistic missile defense review, the Secretary of Defense and the Joint Chiefs of Staff will continue to provide recommendations to the President that address other aspects of our ballistic missile defense capabilities and posture around the world.'"

"'09-09-17,'0','“MY guiding principle is, and always has been, that consumers do better when there is choice and competition,” said last week in an address to Congress on . It’s a good principle, one that may determine the ultimate success or failure of reform, but unfortunately it’s not really guiding the Senate bill unveiled on Wednesday or any of the other health reform legislation now under consideration in Congress.Under the nation’s current employer-based system, most people have little if any choice about where they get their . They just have to accept the plan that comes with their job. That insurance company, in turn, is provided a captive group of customers, so it has no incentive to earn their loyalty.Empowering Americans to choose from a broad selection of health plans would turn the tables. Those insurers that charged affordable rates and provided good coverage would attract more customers, while those that treated customers badly would be forced to change their ways or go out of business. To stay competitive, insurers would need to follow the example of places like the and offer good, low-cost coverage.The various bills making their way through Congress would, as the president explained, provide some consumer choice by establishing large marketplaces where people could easily compare insurance plans and pick the one that best suits their needs. Companies participating in these insurance exchanges would be required to offer coverage to anyone who wants to buy it, regardless of their age, gender or health status, and they would be barred from charging someone more for having a pre-existing condition.The problem with these bills, however, is that they would not make the exchanges available to all Americans. Only very small companies and those individuals who can’t get insurance outside of the exchange — 25 million people — would be allowed to shop there. This would leave more than 200 million Americans with no more options, private or public, than they have today.'"

"'09-09-17,'0','It has been nearly 20 years since Congress repealed the provisions used during the cold war to deny visas to prominent foreign intellectuals, artists and activists because of their left-leaning politics, including the Colombian novelist Gabriel García Márquez, the Chilean poet Pablo Neruda and the British novelist Doris Lessing.The Bush administration eagerly revived the practice, barring numerous people from entering the country for speaking engagements or conferences or to teach at leading universities — all under a flimsily supported guise of fighting terrorism.Adam Habib, a well-known intellectual, professor and human rights activist from South Africa, was interrogated for seven hours and told that his visa had been revoked when he tried to enter the United States in 2006 for professional meetings. He was later told that his exclusion was based on terrorism-related grounds. He is challenging the action in court, but the government has yet to explain its precise legal or factual reasoning.In 2004, the Bush administration revoked the visa of Tariq Ramadan, a Swiss national and Muslim scholar, who was to become a tenured professor at the University of Notre Dame. It again denied him a visa in 2006. Two months ago, a three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in Manhattan unanimously reversed a lower-court ruling allowing the government’s move.The government cited evidence that from 1998 to 2002, Mr. Ramadan contributed about $1,300 to a Swiss-based charity that the Treasury Department later categorized as a terrorist organization. Mr. Ramadan said that he believed the group was involved in humanitarian projects, and that he was not aware of any connections between the charity, the Association de Secours Palestinien, and Hamas or terrorism, which, he said, he condemns. The evidence suggests that Mr. Ramadan’s strong criticism of United States foreign policy is what really triggered his exclusion.Months ago, a group of free speech advocates, including the Association of American Publishers, the American Library Association and the American Civil Liberties Union called on the Obama administration to end ideological exclusions and to review dubious visa denials. We hope Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton takes heed.'"

The industry is deploying lobbyists, jawboning lawmakers, doling out campaign contributions and trying to persuade Treasury and banking officials.So far, they appear to be winning some concessions. Sheila Bair, the chairwoman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and Barney Frank, the chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, have both said they would favor allowing owners of existing industrial banks to maintain their banking operations.“They told me that divestiture would be very disruptive, and I agreed,” Mr. Frank, Democrat of Massachusetts, said in an interview, referring to Jeffrey R. Immelt, the chief executive at General Electric, and other G.E. executives who met with him in July. “It is not a matter of them wreaking havoc.”Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner and other officials are pressing ahead with their proposal to require the institutions to submit to Federal Reserve oversight, part of a sweeping package of regulatory reforms. But the battle over the banks, expected to intensify now that Congress is back in session, demonstrates how difficult enacting tougher regulation can be.The nation’s industrial banks hold $130 billion, only about 1 percent of federally insured bank deposits. They trace their history to the early 1900s when small lending houses sprang up to offer loans to factory workers who otherwise could not get credit. Today, the banks — almost all are in Utah, Nevada and California — do all manner of lending.Unlike commercial banks, though, all but the smallest industrial banks are barred from offering checking accounts, so most have no retail branches. And they are not supervised by the Federal Reserve nor are their parent companies required to set aside capital reserves that could be used if a bank gets into trouble.While no industrial bank has failed in the last year, Capmark Bank sustained losses that are forcing it to curtail operations. The F.D.I.C. recently ordered another, Advanta Bank Corporation, to stop taking new customers because it was in peril.Utah became a haven for industrial banks in the last decade, relaxing laws to lure them there after Congress prohibited them in states that did not already have them. Companies like BMW and Pitney Bowes, and major investment banks, including Lehman Brothers, Morgan Stanley and Merrill Lynch, soon set up shop. Assets at such banks in Utah skyrocketed from $3 billion in 1995 to $243 billion last year, although the numbers have since dropped to $106 billion, largely as a result of a rush to convert to commercial bank status to qualify for government bailout money.In Salt Lake City, the banks have been a welcome presence. They created an estimated 15,000 jobs at the banks and related service companies, and their executives have sprinkled money around to everything from the Utah Symphony Orchestra to housing for the poor.The Obama administration plan, though, presents a double threat to the state. If the Treasury department prevails in insisting on Federal Reserve oversight for industrial banks, there is no reason for those owned by national financial services companies to be headquartered in Utah. And terminating the industrial bank charter, along with other new requirements, could force manufacturing giants like G.E. to sell their financial arms because of federal prohibitions against commercial companies operating banks.Indeed, perhaps no company has more at stake in the debate than G.E., which operates its $10 billion industrial bank, GE Capital Financial, at the foot of the Wasatch Mountains, 15 miles south of downtown Salt Lake City.Located in a new office complex, it hardly seems like a bank at all: it has no branches, no A.T.M.’s and hardly any walk-in customers. But it lends to businesses across the nation. It has financed loans to more than 5,000 fast-food restaurants, helped equip about 4,000 dentists’ offices and allowed small businesses to buy tens of thousands of forklifts, delivery vans and other equipment.“This is boring — forklifts, grills at Burger King,” said Russell Wilkerson, a G.E. executive who was visiting his company’s Utah offices last month. “It is middle-market America.”Those loans may be boring, but they have proven to be lucrative. G.E.’s industrial bank ranked as the nation’s 46th most profitable bank earlier this year.If General Electric had to sell off GE Capital — the large financial unit of which the industrial bank is a subsidiary — it would cost shareholders $40 billion in lost market capitalization, or 22 percent of current market capitalization, according to an estimate by a Goldman Sachs analyst, because of higher taxes, lower net income and higher capital overall requirements. “It is first unnecessary because it did not contribute to the crisis, and second it would be disruptive to the economy and lending,” Brackett B. Denniston, G.E.’s general counsel, said in an interview.Like other industrial banks here, G.E.’s is regulated by Utah’s Department of Financial Institutions, as well as the F.D.I.C. State officials resent any suggestion that they are lax in their oversight.“We have proven there is a way to manage these institutions,” said Darryle P. Rude, Utah’s chief industrial bank supervisor. “So why would you want to eliminate a system that has not been a threat?”But critics tick off a list of complaints about the banks, including assertions that owning them gives their corporate parents an unfair advantage and encourages risky practices.Companies that own industrial banks can finance lending operations more cheaply than their competitors by relying on federally insured deposits at their banks, instead of going to the more costly bond market, said Matthew Anderson, a consultant who studies bank industry earnings.In addition, he and others point out, state regulators and the F.D.I.C. do not have the same powers as the Federal Reserve to demand changes in risky business practices by parent companies that might indirectly threaten their industrial banks.Treasury officials have not blamed industrial banks for a role in the financial crisis, but they do argue that the regulatory loophole permitted abusive actions by some of their parent companies that fed the problems.“This is not about picking on anyone, but they contributed to risk in the system,” said a Treasury official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to comment on the issue.A few industry observers go further in their complaints. Some companies intentionally chose an industrial bank charter — where they could raise money through brokered C.D.’s, investor funds in cash accounts and funds from business clients — so that they could take riskier bets and have higher leverage in their other business units, argued Raj Date, who leads a nonprofit industry research group, Cambridge Winter.He said that parent companies of eight of what had been the top 12 Utah industrial banks filed for bankruptcy protection or received large allotments of federal bailout funds or other federal financial support in the last year. Those companies — including Merrill Lynch, GMAC, Morgan Stanley and CIT — consumed $70 billion, according to Mr. Date’s analysis. (Those institutions have all closed their industrial banks, in most cases a condition of accepting the money.)“The United States of America has lost billions of dollars based on inadequate regulation,” said James A. Leach, a former Republican congressman from Iowa and longtime critic of industrial banks. “Once you set up an exception like the industrial bank charter, the smart and the big are not dumb. They will exploit it. And that is just what they did.”Executives at industrial banks, including those operated by Harley Davidson, Toyota, Pitney Bowes and G.E., reject criticism they were a factor in the financial crisis, a position shared by Ms. Bair, the F.D.I.C. chairwoman.The bankers said that many financial institutions without industrial banks also turned to the federal government for a bailout. They added that industrial banks have nearly twice the capital reserves of a typical commercial bank.“For the last ten years the industrial banks have been the strongest, best capitalized, most profitable, least likely to fail banks in the country,” said George Sutton, a former Utah bank regulator who has helped set up several industrial banks.The de facto headquarters for the industry’s lobbyists is a small office building a few blocks from the Utah capitol, where Douglas S. Foxley and Frank R. Pignanelli are based. The partners, one a Democrat and the other a Republican, have tried to persuade skeptics in Washington that the industrial banks are part of the solution to the economic crisis, not a cause.They have appealed to Utah’s Congressional delegation, the home state delegations of the banks’ parent companies, and Congressional and committee leaders. The banks’ parent companies have made campaign contributions to some lawmakers.For example, G.E., which has a variety of issues before Congress having to do with its role as a defense contractor, manufacturer and financial powerhouse, made $500,000 in donations to legislators since January, including the Senate majority leader, Harry Reid, Democrat of Nevada; Senator Christopher Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut, the chairman of the Senate Banking committee, and Senator Bob Bennett, Republican of Utah.“What it comes down to is a lot of blocking and tackling,” said Mr. Foxley, the lobbyist. “We have to stop this.”'"
"'09-09-17,'0','Mr. Cuomo’s office wants to know whether Bank of America’s board knew of additional losses discovered at Merrill after the merger was signed, as well as billions of dollars in bonus payments made to Merrill executives before the deal closed.Based on earlier interviews with the bank’s executives, investigators believe the bank’s audit committee and other directors might have known about losses and bonus payments before shareholders voted to approve the deal in early December, this person said.“A big unanswered question as we look back on the financial crisis is — where were the boards?” Mr. Cuomo said in an e-mail message. “Did the boards of directors of our largest financial institutions protect the rights of shareholders, were they misled, or were they little more than rubber stamps for management’s decision-making?”The scrutiny comes as Bank of America, which has accepted $45 billion in government bailouts, faces mounting pressures over its merger with Merrill.This week, Judge Jed S. Rakoff rejected a settlement that would have put an end to a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation into possible securities violations by the bank in the Merrill deal. In his ruling, the judge criticized the S.E.C. for not holding individuals at Bank of America accountable. The ruling could pave the way for a public court battle between the bank and the S.E.C. early next year.It is rare for prosecutors to subpoena members of a company’s board in a criminal case. Mr. Cuomo’s action is an indication that board members may not be immune to charges in cases where executives they oversee are prosecuted, said Cornelius Hurley, a professor at the Boston University School of Law.“I would be very concerned if I was a director of Bank of America,” Mr. Hurley said.Mr. Cuomo’s office plans to issue subpoenas to all 15 board members in the coming weeks, according to one of the people briefed on the investigation.Investigators plan to ask the directors how much they knew about Merrill’s losses, and what role they played in decisions about disclosing information to shareholders, the person said.The attorney general also plans to ask board members about what pressure the government may have brought to bear on the bank’s decision to disclose the bonuses and losses to shareholders, as well as whether government officials said they would remove management and the board if Bank of America didn’t proceed with the deal.A Bank of America spokesman, Lawrence Di Rita, said the bank will continue to cooperate with Mr. Cuomo’s office. “There is no basis for charges against either the company or individual members of the management team.”'"
"'09-09-17,'0','MILWAUKEE (AP) — DNA profiles of at least 12,000 Wisconsin felons are missing from a statewide database, according to an audit released Wednesday. The audit was conducted after officials discovered that no DNA was on file for a felon now suspected in a string of killings in Milwaukee.Investigators have since found that a sample had been submitted in the name of the suspect, Walter E. Ellis, but that the DNA and fingerprint belonged to a different inmate, said the state attorney general, J. B. Van Hollen.The other inmate may have lied about his identity when submitting the sample, but it is unlikely that that was what happened in the case of the other samples that are missing, said Gary Hamblin, who is administrator of the Division of Law Enforcement Services and conducted the audit.“For those 12,000 people convicted of a felony, our records indicate a DNA sample has not been collected,” Mr. Hamblin said.About 70 percent of those people are believed to be in custody or still under state supervision, and it should be easy to gather samples from them, he said. It will take more analysis to determine how to get samples from the other 30 percent, he said.The database has 120,000 to 130,000 profiles, Mr. Hamblin said. Some of the missing ones may be from people convicted of felonies but sentenced to probation, meaning that they never reported to prison to have a sample taken, he added.'"
"'09-09-17,'0','Lord knows it’s rough out there in the housing market. Still, you had to feel bad for Patty Bonadies, digging with a spoon in the rocky soil in front of the new three-story colonial for sale at 7 Old Roaring Brook Road in search of the tiny statue of St. Joseph she had buried in hopes of helping the house sell.“I should have brought a bigger spoon,” she said. She wanted to move the statue, which she had planted near the front door in May, to a perhaps more propitious spot. Her late mother-in-law’s house in Dobbs Ferry, N.Y., is for sale, and she plans to plant a statue there, too. “You have to believe,” she said. “In this market, you’re looking for any help you can get.”Mrs. Bonadies, a real estate agent for three years, is Roman Catholic, but St. Joseph, who is said to look after homes, families and carpenters, among many other things, isn’t just for Catholics anymore. With the housing market still dismal, the Catholic tradition of planting a statue of him as a way to help a house sell is going like gangbusters online, in stores selling religious goods and elsewhere — even if home sales are not.“In the past, we’ve seen some upticks in sales of the kits whenever there’s a sign that the housing market is on the skids,” said Nicholas Cole, director of marketing for the Catholic Company, based in Charlotte, N.C., which sells religious items online and through catalogs. “But the sales of the product have been really strong for the last two years. We saw a really big spike last year, and they’re still really selling. I don’t want to say ‘desperate’ is the right word, but I think it’s selling to people across the board, not just Catholics.”He added that the statue had helped him sell a house and a condominium in the past few years.It’s not completely clear when the tradition began, and devotees disagree over how best to participate. Head down? By the “for sale” sign? In a flowerpot? But it has been adopted by many real estate agents, who suggest that sellers, particularly in this market, give the statue a chance.'"

Ms. Pingree, a Democrat, said Coast Guard officials told her they had withdrawn the rule making waters around Seal Island off limits. Officials had been concerned about unexploded bombs left over from the mid-20th century when the Navy used the island as an aerial bombing range. Ms. Pingree said the rule was withdrawn because the risk level was unknown and the economic impact on fishermen was greater than first thought. About 30 fishermen tend to hundreds of traps in the waters.'"
"'09-09-17,'0','Mr. Gearhart said the center’s announcement was timed to give a lift to current efforts in Congress to introduce legislation to more closely regulate toxic chemicals that end up in so many household products.“Current laws that regulate individual products are stopgap measures,” he said, “Ultimately we need to move to a system that doesn’t regulate the end product but regulates the chemicals themselves.”Still, many experts on public health and toxicology cast doubt on the significance of finding lead in a woman’s handbag, for example, where it had little chance of ending up in a growing child’s digestive system.Dr. Andrew D. Racine, director of the division of general pediatrics at the Children’s Hospital at Montefiore in the Bronx, said that any item that contained significant quantities of lead should not be given to children. But in most cases, knowing that a product may contain measurable quantities of a potentially toxic chemical is not helpful, he said.“What does this mean?” he asked. “What’s the impact on our health? Without knowing that, all this does is frighten people.”Some manufacturers echoed his observation that the report did not take into account actual exposure to the chemical.For example, Jerry Sciarini, quality manager for OurPet’s, the manufacturers of the Play-N-Squeak Shake y’r Tail Feather mouse, objected to its being rated with a “high level” of concern. He said the lead was sewn into the toy and further sealed into a layer of plastic to protect the animal.“There are no standards for pets, but retailers see pets as members of the family and ask us to treat them like they are, so we do,” Mr. Sciarini said.Yet Charlotte Brody, the national field director for Safer Chemicals, Healthy Families, a Washington group that lobbies for more regulation of toxic chemical manufacturers, said it was useful for the public to have the information.“The honest answer to this report is we do not know how big a deal it is,” she said. “Every year we learn that what we had learned was a safe level of a chemical turns out not to be that safe.“If people are telling you lead is safe, even in small amounts, it isn’t science. It is hubris.”'"
"'09-09-17,'0','FLORHAM PARK, N.J. — Eric Mangini and Brett Favre cost the Jets again Wednesday. But this time, instead of contributing to a late-season collapse, Favre’s injury last season — and the team’s failure to properly disclose it — carried a $125,000 price tag.The N.F.L. appeared to make an example of the Jets, fining the team $75,000 and docking General Manager Mike Tannenbaum and Mangini, now coach of the Cleveland Browns, $25,000 each.“We have been fully cooperative with the league throughout this investigation and respect their decision,” the team said in a statement.And with that, the Jets’ grand Favre experiment took another strange turn, even though Favre retired (again) at the end of last season, came out of retirement (again) in August and now plays for the Minnesota Vikings.Favre and the Jets had seemed like the perfect marriage through the first 11 games last season. Mangini gave his infant son the middle name Brett, and Favre led the Jets back into relevance, capped by an 8-3 record and legitimate Super Bowl aspirations.'"
"'09-09-17,'0','That sounds bad — until you learn that the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index returned about 13 percent and a negative 38.49 percent for the same respective time periods. Clearly, hedge funds came out ahead.Hedge funds also provide what the industry calls absolute returns. Mutual funds aim simply to beat their market benchmark, meaning they’ll define themselves as successful if they drop 14 percent while the S.& P. 500 falls 15 percent. By contrast, hedge fund managers are not paid until they generate positive returns — that is, they actually make money.“But what about the risk?” you might ask.Hedge funds do more than diversify investment portfolios. They live up to their name: they (ideally) hedge their returns so that they are less volatile. True, some funds have failed. But General Motors went bankrupt, and we’re not about to halt the stock market.According to Hedge Fund Research, about 16 percent of hedge funds closed last year. That may sound like a lot, but it does not mean that all that capital was wiped out. Even investors in Long-Term Capital Management and Amaranth Advisors, two of the most spectacular hedge fund flameouts, got back 10 percent and 35 percent of their money, respectively.The overwhelming majority of hedge fund liquidations are orderly runoffs that result in some loss for investors, but not an entire loss of their principal investments. Before the financial crisis, one study found that the majority of hedge fund closures stemmed from operational risk, not investment failure. Funds that did fail because of their investment performance collapsed because of liquidity issues and investor withdrawals.This does not mean that investors should put all of their money in one hedge fund, just as they shouldn’t invest only in General Motors. But hedge funds are an important part of the diversified investment portfolio that financial experts recommend.Finally, there is the perceived complexity of hedge funds. Are these firms really more arcane than the complicated investment banks of today like Goldman Sachs? The truth is that public hedge funds are no more complex than many of today’s public companies.The S.E.C. has tried again and again to restrict public investment in hedge funds, but the problem is that the markets are moving too fast. The financial revolution and demands of investors mean that hedge fund-like products that are being marketed to the general public are being created, legally. Thus, we have the IndexIQ’s Hedge Multi-Strategy Tracker Exchange-Traded Fund. According to IndexIQ, the fund is meant “to replicate, before fees and expenses, the returns of the IQ Hedge Multi-Strategy Index,” which encompasses a variety of hedge fund investment techniques.If you want to build your own hedge fund, you can now buy other exchange-traded funds or exchange-traded notes for oil, currencies and various commodities. My favorite is the iPath DJ-UBS Coffee Subindex Total Return E.T.N., which tries to replicate an index of coffee future contracts. Pretty complex, no?Because of another regulatory loophole, the S.E.C. allows the public listing of hedge fund firms like the Fortress Investment Group and Och-Ziff Capital Management — but not the funds they run. Of course, these firms draw their income from these unlistable hedge funds, so an investment in Och-Ziff’s stock is similar to a direct investment in one of its funds. But holding Och-Ziff stock is even riskier than investing in one of its funds, since limited partners can have their capital returned if the fund runs negative returns. Stockholders in the firm in the same situation receive nothing.The real issue with hedge funds is systemic risk: the possibility of another Long-Term Capital, when one fund almost took down the whole financial system. Regulators must have the tools to prevent this kind of danger.Having hedge funds report their investments to the S.E.C. (or another regulator) and limiting systemic risk through capital requirements is now before legislators. But making these firms more accessible to average investors would be a natural incentive to bring them further into the light. The market process would help obtain disclosure about their investments. It would also offer an alternative to the roughly $10 trillion mutual fund industry, which all too often fails to beat its benchmark indexes.Because why shouldn’t public retail investors get the same benefits as private wealthy investors?'"
"'09-09-17,'0','“Incentive fees should go only to managers with the skill needed to add enough to returns to more than offset the fees,” Mr. Marks wrote in July.By his calculations, a typical debt-focused hedge fund would need to earn 36 percent more than a high-yield bond mutual fund, which charged a standard 0.5 percent fee, just to achieve the same return.“How many managers in a given asset class can generate this incremental 36 percent other than through an increase in risk?” Mr. Marks asked. “A few? Perhaps. The majority? Never.”Managers who actually helped their clients weather the financial crisis deserve to be very well compensated, he argued. “But the rest should receive smaller fees or be denied incentive arrangements,” he said. (He added that he hoped Oaktree turned out to be one of the few hedge funds that deserved rich compensation.)Now some big hedge fund investors, including pension funds and endowments, are making similar arguments, though many still fear reprisal from successful managers if they criticize too harshly. These investors, who have long tried to push for smaller fees with little success, are now starting to flex their muscles, according to a June study from Barclays Capital.The California Public Employees Retirement System, or Calpers, the nation’s largest public pension fund, has publicly called on hedge funds to reduce both their management and performance fees and to increase transparency. Calpers, which lost 19 percent in its hedge fund portfolio last year, said it would pull its money from firms that refused to follow its standards.Unlike some other investors, Calpers has followed through on its promise, withdrawing $1.1 billion from nine hedge funds so far this year, according to AR magazine. Among them are Farallon Capital Management, Canyon Capital Advisors and Atticus Capital. In 2007, Calpers paid the three firms a combined $12.1 million in fees.Larry Powell, the deputy chief investment officer for the $16 billion Utah Retirement System, issued a memo in March to hedge funds, calling on managers to put in effect “claw-back” arrangements that force managers to return some of the fees they collected in prior years if they fail to perform in the current one. It is unclear whether any firms actually changed their terms.Critics of hedge fund fees point out that several internal managers at Harvard’s $26 billion endowment had to return parts of bonuses earned in prior years after the fund dropped 27 percent in 2008.“Harvard is certainly on the cutting edge when it comes to pay for performance,” said Brad Alford, a former investment executive for Duke University who now heads Alpha Capital Management, an investment advisory firm. “It’s something the industry as a whole should emulate.”Even with last year’s losses, established hedge fund managers say they have given up little ground so far. “There’s been very little discussion of reduction in fees by those managers who perform well,” Daniel Och, head of Och-Ziff Capital Management, said on a recent conference call with analysts.Still, about a third of hedge fund managers reduced their fees on existing funds this year, according to Barclays. But many have demanded that investors lock up their cash for longer periods of time. Others have been forced to restructure their funds because of poor performance last year and a high number of redemption requests, according to Andrea Gentilini, a director at Barclays Capital.“We’re seeing some movement on management fees, but in the area of performance fees we have seen substantial resilience,” Mr. Gentilini said.New managers and existing funds looking to raise fresh capital have begun to offer more investor-friendly terms, either through lower management fees or special institutional share classes for big investors.Mr. Powell said he had won better terms from 10 of the 40 hedge funds in which Utah has a direct investment. Citadel Investment Group, the giant Chicago-based fund run by Kenneth C. Griffin, is raising a new $2 billion fund with lower fees in exchange for longer lockup periods, according to investors to whom the new fund had been pitched.Others are taking a more customized approach based on how long investors commit to the firm.“Historically, everyone had similar fund terms,” said Stephen V. Raneri, who founded the hedge fund LionEye Capital Management earlier this year. “But now there’s much more discussion of tailoring the fee structure depending on a fund’s particular strategy.”Criticism does not stop with lower fees. Investors also want more stringent performance requirements to ensure managers are not merely benefiting from a bull market, according to Barclays, which surveyed more than 300 hedge fund investors.One idea gaining ground is the imposition of a “hurdle rate,” which sets a specific benchmark a manager must overcome to receive his incentive fee at the end of the year. The hurdle would vary depending on the specific strategy the fund employs. For example, the manager of a simple long-short equity fund would need to beat the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index by at least 2 percentage points to be eligible for the fee.The debate over hedge fund compensation has also found its way into the private equity industry, where “2 and 20” has been the standard for more than two decades.The Institutional Limited Partners Association, which represents investors with $1 trillion invested in private equity funds, released a set of principles this month to guide members in negotiating terms of their private equity investments. Among other things, one of the proposed guidelines involves investors being told more about transaction and monitoring fees that private equity firms get from their portfolio companies.“We want our managers to create tremendous wealth for themselves, as long as we’re in that same boat,” said Joncarlo Mark, a senior portfolio manager at Calpers.'"
"'09-09-17,'0','Of course, too much risk is just as bad. Just ask the financial wizards at American International Group who ended up on the wrong side of tens of billions of dollars in financial contracts, almost bringing down the world’s biggest insurer.But now that the crisis has subsided — knock on wood — it’s important to avoid an overly simplistic view of risk and the financial system. After all, the least risky place for money is under a mattress. But economies don’t work well if everyone puts it there.In conversations with Wall Street chiefs, regulators and economists, a more nuanced view of risk emerges.What’s the state of risk today? There’s some good news, and some bad.Without question, the markets have stabilized, and there doesn’t appear to be another Lehman Brothers (or Merrill Lynch or any others bank) on the horizon as a potential trouble spot at the moment. Those that could spell problems — like Citigroup and A.I.G. — have clearly already been identified. Hedge funds have also been forced to reduce the amount of leverage, or debt, that they use to magnify their profits (or losses) because banks just won’t lend them nearly as much money. Private equity firms have been all but cut off at the knees — preventing them from overpaying, or in some cases, paying at all, for investments, though there are early signs the market may be coming back. Without access to credit, gun-shy corporate boards too have avoided big, expensive mergers and acquisitions, save for a handful of exceptions.Simon Johnson, a professor at Sloan School of Management at M.I.T. who has shouted from the rooftops about risk in the financial system and what he believes is a perverse incentive system to shoot the moon, actually thinks Wall Street has become much more prudent, at least for now.“Back-to-back financial crises are rare; people are more careful,” he said. “We’re in something like 2004-2005 when it comes to risk. But we’ll get back up there.”Perhaps the greatest measure of risk — and in this context, let’s define it as systemic risk to the entire system — is one word: leverage. There was just too much debt being piled up on top of bad bets. And that has come down.But by other measures, there are still pockets — actually large swaths — of the financial services industry that are still taking risk. Lots of it. More than last year. And often for themselves (as opposed to for consumers and clients.)A brief glance at a metric known as VAR or “value at risk,” which ostensibly measures the amount of money an institution could lose on any given day or week, shows that at some firms that number is way up. At Goldman Sachs, for example, the firm’s value at risk has risen from $240 million in the first quarter to $245 million. But the bigger leap is from February 2007, just a month before Bear Stearns was sold to JPMorgan Chase, when Goldman’s VAR stood at only $127 million. As a result, in part, it has recorded some of its most profitable trades in its history.Even though Goldman is now a bank holding company, arguably with more regulatory oversight, the firm’s chief financial officer, David Viniar, told Bloomberg News, “Our model really never changed.”In the immediate term, that may be just fine as Goldman has proved again and again that it appears to know how to “manage risk” better than its peers. But in a business that is somewhat akin to gambling, it is not impossible to believe that the firm’s lucky streak could one day run out.On the other hand, Morgan Stanley, Goldman’s rival, has gone the opposite direction. The firm drastically scaled back its risk-taking, worried that it could overreach. But, oddly enough, it did so at its own peril. While Goldman was minting money by taking more risk, Morgan Stanley was losing money by sitting on the sideline.VAR, by the way, is a horrible way to measure risk, as has been said again and again by economists, because it calculates the risk for only 99 percent of the time. As Mr. Johnson says, “VAR misses everything that matters when it matters.” Indeed, the VAR metrics obviously missed what led to what now has been dubbed the Great Recession.Still, VAR may be a useful way to think about risk directionally.And as odd it as may seem, in this case, more risk may be a positive sign.'"

"'09-09-17,'0','Fans have often complained that prices for tickets at the new Yankee Stadium are too expensive. On Tuesday the Yankees addressed the issue for 2010, saying prices of 84 percent of the tickets in the stadium would remain the same and prices for another 13 percent, for the most expensive seats, would be cut by about 25 percent.“At the beginning of the season I said that we would look into our ticket prices and review them at the end of the year to see where changes needed to be made,” Hal Steinbrenner, the Yankees’ managing general partner, said in a statement. “This plan reflects the changes we believe are appropriate.”Steinbrenner noted that the team had sold more than 90 percent of its seats this year. But that statistic ignores the fact that many of the unsold 10 percent are in the most expensive sections of the park, including seats that once cost $2,500 apiece but were later cut.Game after game, entire rows of premium seats behind home plate and the dugouts have been empty, even for marquee opponents.The Yankees said 3,400 field-level seats that currently cost $325 each would cost $250 or $235 next season, depending on their location. Prices would also be trimmed for 1,208 seats in the Delta Sky360 Suite and 1,846 of the 1,894 seats in the Legends Suite.Fans elsewhere — the bleachers, the grandstand and on the terrace levels — will pay no more for their seats next year.'"

"'09-09-17,'0','The rising cost of gasoline pushed overall consumer prices higher in August even as prices for most other goods and services remained in check, the government reported on Wednesday.The Labor Department’s Consumer Price Index rose 0.4 percent last month after hovering unchanged in July, a sign that inflation was gradually edging back into the economy, though not nearly as fast as some investors have predicted. Prices for housing, food and recreation were up slightly, and prices for new cars and clothing fell from a month earlier.Prices of all other items except food and energy — the so-called core rate of inflation — rose only 0.1 percent in August, suggesting that most costs of living were not following the upward arc of oil and gasoline prices.Over all, core prices were 1.4 percent higher than last August. Health care costs, now the focus of intense debate in Washington, rose for another month, and are among the few areas of consumer spending that did not dip even for one month as the economy tumbled into recession. Medical costs crept up by a seasonally adjusted 0.3 percent in August, and were 3.3 percent higher than a year earlier.Energy prices rose 4.6 percent last month, even though they were nearly one-fourth lower than the same period a year ago, when oil prices began to tumble from their record highs of around $145 a barrel.Some investors are making big bets that heavy government spending and a nascent rebound in the economy will touch off another round of inflation, pushing commodity prices sharply higher and further eroding the value of the dollar. These inflation hawks have helped push the price of gold above $1,000 recently, and they point to rising oil and commodities prices as a harbinger.'"

"'09-09-18,'1','He looks relatively happy, a stocky man in glasses with a little white beard and longish white hair peeking out from the back of his blue Yankees’ cap.Peterson, a left-hander, pitched from 1966 through 1976, most of it with the Yankees, and went 133-131. His presence in New York served as an unusual counterpoint to the fanfare that Derek Jeter created last week as he passed Lou Gehrig’s record for most base hits by a Yankee. Gehrig and Jeter are about Yankee tradition and championships. Peterson? He never got to the postseason with the Yankees and played before a lot of empty seats.“Mediocre at best,” Peterson said of those Yankee teams that followed the Mantle-Maris era. “Pathetic at worst.”In his best season, 1970, he won 20 games for the Yankees, and he was the starting pitcher for Cleveland in 1975 on 10 cent beer night, when that riotous promotion ended in a forfeit.But Peterson is best known for one of baseball’s strangest trades. In 1973, Peterson and Mike Kekich, also a left-handed Yankees pitcher at the time, revealed in spring training that they had exchanged families, like something out of a John Updike novel.Peterson moved in with Kekich’s wife; Kekich moved in with Peterson’s wife. Although Marilyn Peterson did not stay long with Kekich, Fritz married Susanne Kekich.The Yankees and Peterson stayed together for one more year after the swap was disclosed; Fritz and Susanne have remained together for 35. But one of many strange things about Peterson’s quirky book is that he does not mention his spouse by name, only as “my new wife.” She opposed his book, he said.“She’s pretty sensitive about that stuff,” Peterson said. “She read the first three chapters and then stopped.”In the book, Peterson treated the exchange of wives in a peripheral way and complained about how the story was handled in the news media. He said he still communicates occasionally with Kekich by e-mail. “If I saw him at an Old-Timers’ game, we’d have some great laughs,” Peterson said.Peterson said he rushed the book into publication before his wife could talk him out of it, and critical readers will notice misspellings and rambling repetitions.And Yankees fans might be taken aback by some of Peterson’s judgments of others. He is an evangelical Christian who used to work with the Baseball Chapel, a man not without sin who is casting a few stones.In some respects, the Peterson book echoes the “Ball Four” tell-all by Jim Bouton. Coincidentally, Peterson and Bouton roomed together, but Peterson said he had not read Bouton’s book and was offended that Bouton never told him he was keeping a diary.Peterson is also not a fan of Joe DiMaggio, describing him as arrogant and stubborn. Curiously, a photograph in the middle of the book shows a young Peterson standing next to DiMaggio. It was taken on Old-Timers’ Day in 1967. Both are smiling. Another picture shows Whitey Ford and an inscription, “Fritz, if you only would have listened to me.”Friendly enough, but in the book Peterson tells of how Ford doctored the ball to make trick pitches and how Ford warned Peterson not to send Christmas cards to his teammates until he was on the Yankees for at least five years.When asked whether he feared his book would burn bridges with the franchise’s former players, Peterson replied: “You know, I am. But if they get mad at me, that’s O.K. I hope they get serious with the Lord.”Much of the book is lighthearted, recounting pranks. An appendix shows a letter Peterson wrote to the former Yankee first baseman Moose Skowron on a fake letterhead from the Baseball Hall of Fame, asking Skowron to donate his pacemaker after he dies. Another page shows a letter Peterson faked on Yankee stationery requesting Clete Boyer’s participation for what he purports to be an official drinking contest against Don Larsen and Graig Nettles.In the book, Peterson tells of getting arrested for drunken driving in 1995 and how his wife took a picture of him emerging from jail to shame him.But Peterson said he still enjoyed drinking. He has homes in Colorado and New Jersey and often travels in a camper. He worked briefly as a hockey announcer and has held various sales jobs.“I stunk,” he said. “I hated sales.” His best post-baseball job, he said, was when he worked for years as a casino dealer.“I don’t condone gambling,” Peterson said. “But it was fun.”He seems comfortable revealing himself as an imperfect man of contradictions, a Yankee who created headlines but never sipped championship Champagne.'"
"'09-09-18,'1','“The politics of this was driving him in the other direction, against appearing to back down,” said William Perry, who served as defense secretary in the Clinton administration. “But he went with where the technology is today — and where the threat is today.”During last year’s presidential campaign, missile defense was tricky territory for Mr. Obama. His liberal base was allergic to the very words. Mr. Obama, eager to show that he was neither a neophyte nor soft on defense, talked about embracing those technologies that were “proven and cost-effective.”Nine months into his presidency, Mr. Obama has begun to describe what that means. He is not abandoning the two antimissile bases built on American soil in the Bush years, one in Alaska and one in California. But his aides — led by the one veteran of the cold war in his cabinet, Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates — argued Thursday that Iran and North Korea were taking far longer to develop intercontinental missiles than many feared a decade ago.The urgency, they argued, lies in addressing a more imminent threat: Iran’s short- and medium-range missiles.First among those weapons is the Shahab III, the missile that can reach Israel and parts of Europe. It is also the missile that American, Israeli and European intelligence services have charged that Iran hopes to fit with a nuclear warhead. Iran denies that but has refused to answer questions from international inspectors about documents that appear to link the missile program to its nuclear efforts.That standoff has fed the conviction inside the White House that the Iranian threat needs to be countered. But officials argued Thursday that the faster, and surer, way to accomplish that goal was to scrap Mr. Bush’s plan, which would have based antimissile batteries too far from Iran to be useful against short- and medium-range missiles, and put them closer to Tehran.“One of the realities of life is the enemy gets a vote,” said Gen. James E. Cartwright, vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.But Mr. Obama’s critics argue that while Iran is rightly a major focus of missile defense, it is not the only one, and that in dismantling the Bush plan, the new president is undercutting American allies.“I fear the administration’s decision will do just that,” Senator John McCain, Mr. Obama’s Republican rival in last year’s presidential election, said Thursday, adding that the decision came “at a time when Eastern European nations are increasingly wary of renewed Russian adventurism.”But Mr. Obama is betting that over time he can assuage bruised feelings in Europe. And he is betting that his credibility will rise in the Middle East, where he can now argue that the American missile shield will defend both Israel and the Arab states, notably Saudi Arabia and Egypt. There are signs that all of them may be interested in nuclear capabilities of their own — especially if they believe that the United States will not stand up to Iran.But Mr. Obama may also be vulnerable to charges that he could be leaving parts of the continental United States defenseless if Iran makes bigger strides with long-range missiles. His critics point to Iran’s launching of a satellite into space in February. The craft orbited the Earth for nearly three months, passing repeatedly over the United States.“Iran has already demonstrated it has the capability to develop long-range missiles,” said Robert Joseph, one of the architects of Mr. Bush’s missile defense strategy, who was highly critical of Mr. Obama’s decision. “They have both the capability and intention to move forward.”The Obama administration counters that Iran has no long-range rockets and that the threat has been slower to develop than expected.Twenty-six years after Mr. Reagan’s famous speech, the most visible element of his strategy is a system of missile interceptors that sprawl across the wilds of Alaska and a sister base in California. The system’s “kill vehicles” are meant to zoom into space and destroy enemy warheads — presumably a single North Korean launching — by force of impact. Military and private experts say the West Coast interceptors could also smash an Iranian warhead, unless it was headed toward the East Coast of the United States. That is why the Bush administration wanted to erect additional interceptors in Poland. To advocates of the classic vision of missile defense, it is unconscionable to leave the East Coast unprotected.But critics of the interceptor system say its flight tests have repeatedly fallen short, and call its supposed protection a mirage.Now comes the next debate: Whether the Obama plan is any more technologically feasible than past efforts.So Mr. Obama faces the same challenge as Mr. Reagan: Winning the argument that his version of missile defense is workable — or at least workable enough to be a potent political weapon.'"
"'09-09-18,'1','A reputed soldier for the Gambino crime family was sentenced on Thursday to life in prison for his role in the killings of four people in New York. But it was a fifth killing, which resulted in a hung jury, that drew the biggest crowd.Squeezing into benches alongside some of the victims’ family members, more than 40 uniformed court officers filed into federal court in Brooklyn, seeking closure to the fatal shooting in 1976 of Albert Gelb, a highly decorated court officer. Officer Gelb, 27, was killed in his car four days before he was scheduled to testify in a gun case against the mob figure, Charles Carneglia, 63.“Albert Gelb was a hero for the way he lived,” said his sister Emily Gelb, who was allowed to give a victim impact statement on the grounds of relevant conduct, even though a jury in March did not convict Mr. Carneglia on the charge of conspiracy to commit murder.She placed a photograph of her brother, strumming a guitar, on the table next to her. Then she turned to look directly into the face of Mr. Carneglia.“You have no soul,” she said. “You have never shown remorse. I ask that they lock you in a cage fit for the animal that you are. That you never see the light of day. And you never see another person. Where you can live out your life in a filthy sewer where people like you belong.”Mr. Carneglia, who wore a blue prison jumpsuit, had slicked back his graying hair and displayed a long, neatly combed white beard, stared back. He even appeared to smirk at times. And he nodded after Ms. Gelb described how, after her brother’s death, she had strapped on his guitar and had strummed it, hoping to feel a tangible connection to him.'"

"'09-09-18,'1','Investigators say that the Hong Kong partners, who operated under the name Hudson Waterfront Associates, told the buyers, the Extell Development Corporation and the Carlyle Group, to pay a $17 million finder’s fee to Fineview, a company based in the British Virgin Islands, Mr. Morgenthau said.But prosecutors said they believed that Fineview was not a legitimate third-party broker and that the $17 million might have ended up in the hands of the Hong Kong partners.Mr. Morgenthau said investigators were able to track the flow of the money, which was transferred to from the Channel Islands and to London, before ending up in Hong Kong in the hands of someone associated with the investors. By routing the $17 million through Fineview, Mr. Morgenthau said, the investors were able to avoid paying income taxes on it as part of the purchase.Mr. Morgenthau said he hoped that more arrests were coming in the case, but his office was still trying to track financial records that would spell out the relationship between Fineview and the more than a dozen Hong Kong financiers with connections to Hudson Waterfront Associates.Prosecutors said that their investigation dealt with a case of potential tax evasion and had no direct link to Mr. Trump’s claims in the civil suit that the association priced the land too low in the sale. That suit is still pending.Mr. Trump said Thursday, “I greatly commend the district attorney for his work and feel certain it will continue.”Mr. Morgenthau hinted in a press conference in his office that he was hoping for cooperation from Mr. Gross, who prosecutors said avoided paying more than $13,000 in state taxes. Mr. Gross, who faces up to seven years in prison if convicted of third-degree grand larceny, the top charge against him, pleaded not guilty Thursday in State Supreme Court in Manhattan.A lawyer for Mr. Gross, Benjamin Brafman, said he hoped to persuade Mr. Morgenthau’s office to drop criminal charges.“In my view, this should have been handled as a civil tax matter,” Mr. Brafman said outside the courtroom.Mr. Gross’s father is a diamond merchant and business associate of Henry Cheng, chairman of New World Development Ltd. and a leader of the consortium that sold the property that runs from 59th Street to 72nd Street along the Hudson River.Mr. Cheng and his partners — including Vincent Lo, chairman of Shui On Construction and Materials, and Edward Wong of the Edward Wong Group — bought Mr. Trump’s $300 million mortgage on the land for $82 million in 1994 after Mr. Trump was in danger of losing the still-vacant property to his lenders during the recession. But Mr. Trump retained a share of any profits from a sale.Mr. Trump, who had first bought the former railyard in 1974 and whose name was characteristically stamped on some of the buildings, was outraged by the 2005 sale, filing a lawsuit claiming that the deal was a “staggering breach” of his partners’ duty to get the highest price. He said that the partners had ignored bids of nearly $3 billion from Colony Capital, an investment company in Los Angeles, and Richard LeFrak, a New York developer.Further, the lawsuit claimed that the investment group led by Mr. Cheng had failed to report hundreds of millions of dollars of profit to “avoid paying taxes in China and the United States.” The suit said that Mr. Trump had uncovered “fraud by the Cheng group amounting to at least $19.7 million.”Mr. Trump took further umbrage when the partners, instead of immediately handing him his 30 percent share — nearly $500 million —used the proceeds to buy the Bank of America Center in San Francisco, and 1290 Avenue of the Americas, a 2 million-square-foot skyscraper in Manhattan. In 2007, the Hong Kong investors sold their stake in those two buildings to Vornado Realty Trust. Mr. Trump retained his portion.'"

Instead, the Pentagon will deploy a less-ambitious — but more feasible — system of interceptors and sensors, first on ships and later on land.Mr. Bush’s plan was flawed in three fundamental ways. The technology was nowhere near ready. The threat it was supposed to defend against — an Iranian intercontinental ballistic missile — was also years away. And the plan (and Mr. Bush’s ham-fisted insistence on it) gave a far-too-convenient excuse to rail against the West’s encroachment and shirk its responsibility to help contain ’s nuclear ambitions.The new system addresses the first two problems.

"'09-09-18,'1','LOS ANGELES — Government auditors reported Thursday that the effort to secure the Mexican border with technology and fences has fallen years behind schedule, will cost billions of dollars extra in maintenance costs and has no clear means of gauging whether illegal crossings have been curtailed.Mark Borkowski, who directs the Secure Border Initiative for the Department of Homeland Security, stood by the program as “transformational,” but did not challenge the findings. “We are as frustrated as anybody is” with the setbacks, Mr. Borkowski said in an interview.The report, by the Government Accountability Office, Congress’s watchdog, said the department had fallen about seven years behind its goal of putting in place the technology the Bush administration had heavily promoted when it announced the Secure Border Initiative in 2005.In 2006, the report said, the department estimated it would have a system of cameras, radars and sensors in place to aid a force of border guards by the end of 2009, but the completion date is now projected as 2016.“Flaws found in testing and concerns about the impact of placing towers and access roads in environmentally sensitive locations caused delays,” said Richard M. Stana, an author of the report. The cameras and radars, a “virtual fence” in a system designed by the contractor, Boeing, have fallen prey to weather and mechanical problems.'"

"'09-09-18,'1','“Demand for quality products has remained strong,” said Mark Daley, chief executive of Dean & DeLuca, a gourmet retailer based in the United States. “People are enjoying more time together, more time sharing with friends, more time home entertaining.”Mariage Frères, a French merchant of exclusive teas, will open a boutique in Hamburg in November and another in Munich in December. It plans to expand to London in 2010 and then to New York and China.Its director, Philippe Cohen-Tanugi, said the company, which posted revenue of 50 million euros ($73.4 million) in 2008, could grow much faster if it developed a franchise network, something it declined to do.“Believe me, so many have called us for that, we could have opened a store a month and become a Tea Starbucks,” he said, “but our rules of management have remained unaltered since 1983: complete integration and central decision taking in order to keep full control on the Mariage Frères image and identity.”Dammann Frères, another French gourmet tea company, which sells about 800 tons a year, used to offer its teas only through businesses like delicatessens and luxury hotels. But last year, it started to market itself to retail customers, opening its first tea boutique in Paris. Since then, it has opened three boutiques in Japan and is considering a second in the French capital and one in London, said Pierre Merlanchon, marketing manager at Dammann Frères.One of the most aggressive players is a new entrant to the market. TWG Tea, based in Singapore, has managed in two years to expand its annual sales to 650 tons from nothing while also securing shelf space at Dean & DeLuca and getting served in Singapore Airlines’ first-class cabins.TWG Tea’s chairman, Manoj Murjani, said he decided to invest $10 million to found TWG Tea with four partners after an investment he made in a small tea company gave him a sixfold return within 18 months.“We’re really going for the high end of the market, and we’re thinking big and we’re starting big,” he said. “From Year One to Year Two, we’ve grown in terms of revenues tenfold, and going forward, I think we will be growing at fivefold a year.” He declined to give specific sales figures.TWG Tea has one boutique in Singapore and plans to open a second one there in October, then its first in Japan and one in the Middle East in the first quarter of 2010. There are also plans for a shop in New York next year and a counter to open soon at a Dean & DeLuca store in New York.The company clearly has a strong eye for marketing, positioning itself as an innovator with seasonal creations and developing beautiful, elaborate packaging. TWG teas start at $4.20 for 50 grams, or 1.76 ounces.As with other specialist tea merchants, it aims to offer a large range of distinctive blends, including White House Tea, a pai mu tan white tea from Fujian, China, blended with red berries and rose petals, created to celebrate the presidential inauguration of Barack Obama.Gourmet tea remains very much a niche segment of the overall tea market, which has grown steadily in recent years, largely because of tea’s perceived health benefits, market analysts said.According to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, world tea consumption increased to 3.75 million tons in 2007 from 2.95 million tons in 2003, the latest available data.Data from IBISWorld, an industry research company, show that tea consumption in the United States is on the rise, but it is still only the sixth-most-popular drink (not including tap water), after soft drinks, bottled water, beer, milk and coffee.Specialty and gourmet tea is a fast-growing segment within the tea industry. In the United States, it is estimated to account for 8.5 percent of the $2.1 billion in sales in 2009.“The growth in the number of specialty tearooms in the U.S., which is estimated to total over 2,600, has further stimulated demand for gourmet and specialty tea products,” IBISWorld wrote in a research note. “Similar to cafes, these establishments are changing the landscape of tea consumption to become a more social occasion.”Even though tea consumption has been more strongly identified with the British, French companies have had a strong hold on the gourmet market for the last 20 years.“I think that’s because unlike the British that are very used to drinking tea, the French had no preconception about tea; they are willing to experiment,” said Mr. Delmas, of Le Palais des Thés.Mr. Cohen-Tanugi of Mariage Frères said, “The French drink the widest range of teas in the world, bringing the same attention and connoisseurship to the choice of the right tea as they would the proper wine.”Milton Pedraza, chief executive of the Luxury Institute, a market research company in New York, said he thought many tea suppliers had seen tea as a mass-market commodity and sold it that way, leaving space for entrants at the high end of the market.“With the growing popularity of tea, there is an opportunity to differentiate at the top level, even in these challenging economic times,” Mr. Pedraza said. “There is consumer interest in the premium end of almost any category, and I believe a larger segment of tea connoisseurs can be developed globally. But it will take a great deal of education to help consumers to discern differences and be willing to pay a premium, so it will be a slow build.”'"
"'09-09-18,'1','This new approach will provide capabilities sooner, build on proven systems, and offer greater defenses against the threat of missile attack than the 2007 European missile defense program.This decision was guided by two principal factors. First, we have updated our intelligence assessment of Iran's missile programs, which emphasizes the threat posed by Iran's short- and medium-range missiles, which are capable of reaching Europe. There's no substitute for Iran complying with its international obligations regarding its nuclear program, and we, along with our allies and partners, will continue to pursue strong diplomacy to ensure that Iran lives up to these international obligations. But this new ballistic missile defense program will best address the threat posed by Iran's ongoing ballistic missile defense program.Second, we have made specific and proven advances in our missile defense technology, particularly with regard to land- and sea-based interceptors and the sensors that support them. Our new approach will, therefore, deploy technologies that are proven and cost-effective and that counter the current threat, and do so sooner than the previous program. Because our approach will be phased and adaptive, we will retain the flexibility to adjust and enhance our defenses as the threat and technology continue to evolve.To put it simply, our new missile defense architecture in Europe will provide stronger, smarter, and swifter defenses of American forces and America's allies. It is more comprehensive than the previous program; it deploys capabilities that are proven and cost-effective; and it sustains and builds upon our commitment to protect the U.S. homeland against long-range ballistic missile threats; and it ensures and enhances the protection of all our NATO allies.This approach is also consistent with NATO missile -- NATO's missile defense efforts and provides opportunities for enhanced international collaboration going forward. We will continue to work cooperatively with our close friends and allies, the Czech Republic and Poland, who had agreed to host elements of the previous program. I've spoken to the Prime Ministers of both the Czech Republic and Poland about this decision and reaffirmed our deep and close ties. Together we are committed to a broad range of cooperative efforts to strengthen our collective defense, and we are bound by the solemn commitment of NATO's Article V that an attack on one is an attack on all.We've also repeatedly made clear to Russia that its concerns about our previous missile defense programs were entirely unfounded. Our clear and consistent focus has been the threat posed by Iran's ballistic missile program, and that continues to be our focus and the basis of the program that we're announcing today.In confronting that threat, we welcome Russians' cooperation to bring its missile defense capabilities into a broader defense of our common strategic interests, even as we continue to -- we continue our shared efforts to end Iran's illicit nuclear program.Going forward, my administration will continue to consult closely with Congress and with our allies as we deploy this system, and we will rigorously evaluate both the threat posed by ballistic missiles and the technology that we are developing to counter it.I'm confident that with the steps we've taken today, we have strengthened America's national security and enhanced our capacity to confront 21st century threats.Thank you very much, everybody.'"

"'09-09-18,'1','In Japan, the Nikkei 225 stock average rose 173.03 points, to 10,443.80 after the central bank raised its assessment of the country’s economy.Equities rallied in early trading on upbeat data for jobs and manufacturing. Speculation that government measures will help revive the economy and better-than-estimated earnings at companies from Goldman Sachs Group to Johnson & Johnson have spurred a 57 percent rally in the S.& P. 500 from a 12-year low on March 9.The dollar was within a cent of the lowest level versus the euro in a year as the manufacturing gain and an unexpected drop in initial jobless claims spurred investors to sell the greenback and buy higher-yielding assets.

The number of Americans filing first-time claims for jobless benefits fell unexpectedly last week.Crude oil was little changed as optimism that the United States is pulling out of the recession was tempered by ample petroleum inventories in the world’s biggest energy consumer.A government report on Wednesday showed that supplies of crude oil, gasoline and distillate fuel, a category that includes heating oil and diesel, were higher than average last week.“A lot of what we are seeing is a reaction to what’s happening in the financial markets,” said Michael Lynch, president of Strategic Energy & Economic Research in Winchester, Mass. “The fundamentals of the oil market are poor. At some point, attention will have to be paid to them.”'"

Mr. Gates said that the new system would put defenses in place seven years earlier than the Bush plan. While no longer deploying the original interceptors in Poland, the United States “would prefer to put the SM-3s in Poland,” Mr. Gates said.“Those who say we are scrapping missile defense in Europe are either misinformed or misrepresenting the reality of what we are doing,” Mr. Gates said. He added that the new configuration “provides a better missile defense capability” for Europe and American forces “than the program I recommended almost three years ago.”Mr. Gates and other officials said Iran was moving quickly toward a workable arsenal of missiles that could strike Israel and Europe. In May, Iran launched the Sejil-2, a successful test of a two-stage solid-fuel missile with an estimated range of 1,200 miles.

"'09-09-19,'0','Abstract dance is more like a poem or a work of abstract art than like a story. Images, ideas and associations conjured by the dancing bodies can float up and hang loosely in your mind as you watch; how they cohere and the evocative power they assume is one measure of how successful a piece is.In most cases finding a specific meaning or message seems unimportant; it’s likely, in any event, that a finished dance bears only a loose connection to the set of ideas that a choreographer began with.In Lucy Guerin’s “Corridor,” which opened at the Baryshnikov Arts Center on Wednesday night, the relationship between intent and outcome seemed tighter. As the title suggests, the piece is set on a long catwalk of sorts, framed on either side by a row of chairs for the audience and mirrored screens at either end. The dancers — three men, three women — emerge from those rows, first one chatting self-absorbedly on his cellphone, then the others, until all are pacing up and down the stage, absorbed in their own private worlds.Eventually the first man (Kyle Kremerskothen) begins to make twitchy, jerky arm movements as he talks, and the others imitate him, eventually pocketing their phones in favor of this wordless, physical communication. Pairs of dancers, facing one another from opposite sides of the long space, begin to copy one another with precise, idiosyncratic movements; arms lashing away from the body and pulling back, body dipping and ducking to the sides, the torso occasionally contracting spasmodically.Later Lee Serle walks from one dancer to another, describing what he or she is doing (“She’s putting on a mask”; “He’s jumping up and down”). Still later each man proceeds to give each woman choreographic instructions (“Your arm is resting on a body of water”; “Your fingers have a life of their own, doing evil things”).'"
"'09-09-19,'0','MCNABB DOUBTFUL Quarterback Kevin Kolb took all the snaps with the Eagles’ first team in practice and answered all the questions about his preparedness to make his first N.F.L. start.Kolb appears set to get that chance against New Orleans on Sunday after the Eagles’ regular starter, Donovan McNabb, was listed as doubtful because of a fractured rib. McNabb sat out practice for the third straight day Friday.The Eagles have not ruled out McNabb, leaving open the slim chance that McNabb, who once threw four touchdown passes on a broken ankle, will try to play through his painful rib injury.McNabb bellowed, “I feel great,” and laughed as he left the Eagles’ locker room Friday. Coach Andy Reid said there was a chance McNabb would participate in Saturday’s walkthrough.“He felt a little bit better today and we’ll just keep rehabbing him and see how it goes the next couple of days,” Reid said.Kolb, who has never thrown a touchdown pass in eight career games, said he was ready to start.“In my mind, I’m the starter,” he said. “That’s the way I have to think of it.”Kolb would get the start ahead of Jeff Garcia, who signed Tuesday as an emergency backup. Garcia would be the No. 3 emergency quarterback if McNabb were able to play. Michael Vick, suspended for the first two regular-season games as the final league penalty for his role in running a dogfighting ring, will not be eligible until Week 3 against Kansas City.SEAHAWK ON MEND Walter Jones could play Sunday for the Seahawks at San Francisco, one month to the day after knee surgery.Jones, Seattle’s nine-time Pro Bowl left tackle, had his most extensive practice on Friday since his second knee surgery in eight months. The 35-year-old Jones did some team drills and was listed as questionable.Coach Jim Mora said Jones had progressed more than expected. Mora said he was waiting for Jones to say he was ready, but Mora cautioned “we can’t be greedy” and play Jones too soon.“Walter just needs to let us know,” Mora said. “When he’s ready to go, we’ll get him in there — whether it’s this Sunday, next Sunday, the following Sunday.”FINES FOR MOSS AND WEBSTER The league fined Redskins receiver Santana Moss and Giants cornerback Corey Webster $5,000 apiece for their tussle during last week’s game.Moss and Webster struck each other in the head during the second quarter of the Giants’ 23-17 victory over Washington.

"'09-09-19,'0','She feels lucky because a law school friend hired her at a prestigious firm in , Calif.For Lisa Hughes, a mother of two, it was an unexpected layoff that shoved her back into the labor pool.A former corporate lawyer, she moved from Montclair, N.J., to last year, after the World Poker Tour recruited her husband to be its chief operating officer. Then, squeezed by the recession, the tour laid him off, pushing Ms. Hughes to pursue full-time work for the first time in 16 years.“Never in my wildest dreams did I imagine he would be unemployed a year later,” she said. She plans to start a solo practice because “it’s hard to find jobs after 16 years.”According to some economists, these women, once part of a privileged minority that could afford not to work, are now collateral damage of the recession — not forced out of work, but back into it.“What’s happened is 78 percent of the people who lost their jobs in the recession are men,” said Joan Williams, director of the Center for WorkLife Law at the Hastings College of Law in . “That has brought home to many families that having one income places you in a very vulnerable position. Some women who expected to take a long time out of the work force suddenly felt they needed to re-enter, in some cases much more quickly than they expected.”The federal found preliminary evidence of affluent women returning to the labor force. When it comes to women with a college education who are 25 to 44 years old and living with a spouse, the proportion of those working or looking for work increased to 78.4 percent in the first half of 2009, from 76 percent in the first half of 2007. Economists say this is surprising because the percentage of people in the work force usually drops as unemployed workers grow discouraged and stop looking for work in a recession.Over the same period, the proportion of men of the same age and circumstance inched down, falling from 97.4 percent to 97.1 percent.It is too early to tell whether those numbers reflect an increase above and beyond the long-term growth of women’s participation in the work force.Examining women’s work force participation — and especially women with children — has been one of the battlefields of economics.In the last several years, some researchers have suggested that many affluent working mothers chose to leave the work force during the boom times of the 90’s and early this decade, saying there was a trend of women opting out of careers once they had children. The suggestion — highlighted in an Oct. 26, 2003 New York Times Magazine cover article — prompted a huge controversy.Critics responded that most women had no choice but to work and that only a small affluent minority could chose not to. They said many working mothers left the labor force not because they were opting to, but because they were forced to by workplaces that made it too difficult to balance family and work. Separately, some economists argued that the decrease in women working was not caused by opting out, but by the 2001 recession that was followed by years of weak job growth.Heather Boushey, a senior economist at the liberal Center for American Progress and a fierce critic of the notion of opting out, said her studies showed little difference in how often mothers and women without children left the labor force.Ms. Boushey nonetheless agreed that the current recession was pushing women who had stopped working for whatever reason to re-enter the labor force.She said this helped explain why the percentage of women aged 20 and above in the work force has remained relatively flat during the recession, while the percentage of men has fallen slightly. “This does indicate that some women are opting back in,” she said.One of them is Patricia Smart. She quit her banking job 14 years ago when her son was born. But last April, her husband received a layoff notice. “It was a cosmic kick in the butt,” said Ms. Smart, who had toyed with returning to work for years. “It forced me to do something.”After a quick job search, she landed a job in July as a full-time manager at Wachovia Bank in , N.C.Carolyn Bednarz was not as fortunate. The former lawyer at Milbank & Tweed spent nine years at home raising three children, but she became frightened for her family’s future after her banker-husband endured four rounds of layoffs and reduced bonuses.Ms. Bednarz started looking for work. After a 10-month search she couldn’t find a paying job.“I probably applied for 30 jobs on , and hardly anyone writes back,” she said, complaining that many employers aren’t interested in hiring someone who has not worked in years. “This is just the most humbling experience.”In the end, she took a position as an unpaid intern at a law firm in Marin County, Calif., north of San Francisco.Several studies have found that two different groups of women are likely not to return to work after giving birth: affluent ones and poor ones unable to afford child care.Sylvia Ann Hewlett, founder of the Center for Work-Life Policy in New York, an independent research group, and several other economists and experts argue that there is an unmistakable trend toward women returning to the labor force — and not just professional women.“Women are at a watershed moment,” Ms. Hewlett said, pointing to the recession’s squeeze on incomes.Anna Bresnahan of , Wash., says she would not have returned to work if she and her husband had not started worrying that the bank where he worked might fail. “I decided I could start looking. He said, ‘That would be nice.’ ”Ms. Bresnahan, who quit a marketing job in 2001 after her first child was born, found a position with an accounting firm in December, although at a lower salary. (Studies have found that for every two years a woman is out of the labor force, her earnings fall by 10 percent, a penalty that lasts throughout her career.)Karen Boon felt pressured to return to working full time after staying home for five years to raise her two children. Her husband’s job for , a manufacturer of medical devices, was shaky and the family’s investments had plunged.Ms. Boon regularly visits the Opting Back In chat room, sponsored by the Hastings College of Law, where lawyers with new jobs trade stories, tips, hopes and complaints.“If my husband had been laid off, it would have been a world of hurt,” she said.In April, she found a temporary job as counsel for a Bay Area company that oversees surgery centers, replacing someone on maternity leave.She said it was a pleasure to be working with adults again.Still, she added, “It is really hard to do two jobs at once — the kids still need to be fed and the laundry still needs to get done.”Ms. Bednarz, the former Milbank lawyer turned intern, also participates in the chat room. “The women who lead the chat room say, ‘Don’t jump into something until you find something that’s just right,’ ” she said. “That’s all well and fine, but some of us have to find something right now. It’s not like we have that luxury in today’s job market.”'"
"'09-09-19,'0','MILLBURN, N.J.  The principal of Millburn High, New Jersey’s top-ranked high school, says it has gone on for a decade: annual hazing by senior girls who create a “slut list” of incoming freshmen for the first day of school. A dozen or more names are written on a piece of notebook paper, with crass descriptions, and copies are passed around  hundreds this year, some say.“We’ve had girls  which is one of the bad things  obsessed that their names are on it, and girls who were upset that they didn’t make the list,” said the principal, William Miron. “It’s basically vulgar.”And that is not the only type of hazing that goes on, some girls say. Seniors blow whistles in some girls’ faces and jostle or push them into lockers, leaving them afraid to come to school the next day.These tales were out in the open on Friday after half a dozen parents complained to public school officials and a discussion of hazing on a private e-mail group for mothers made its way around this Essex County township.Dr. Miron said this year’s list was generated at an August sleepover party of seniors involved in athletics. Like most, it took aim at pretty and popular incoming ninth graders.In past years, students found responsible for hazing have been suspended, and up to six senior girls in one year have been held out of school for three to five days, Dr. Miron said. This year, which parents in the e-mail group considered worse than usual, none have been reprimanded.“We spoke to at least a dozen freshmen and half a dozen seniors, and not one person wanted to really give any names,” Dr. Miron said. “There’s very little we can really do if a student doesn’t come to us and say, ‘This is what happened.’ ” He added that none of the 150 faculty members reported seeing any hazing incidents this year at the 1,400-student school.Most of the girls interviewed after school on Friday said they had never been hazed. Some had not even heard of the problem, and some of those who had said it was all in good fun. One girl talking with friends on Millburn Avenue several blocks from the high school said freshmen were unlikely to name names.“Then you’ll be the loser,” said the girl, 14, who said she had not been hazed and whose father, contacted later, requested that she not be named. “And it gets much worse.”Across the street, several freshman girls in sports uniforms said that senior girls on the soccer team had blown whistles in their faces, and that some of their teammates had been pushed into lockers.“I was scared, actually,” one said. “I didn’t want to go to school the next day. It’s done every year, but it’s still pretty mean.” (After the interview, she asked that her name not be used and that the team she was with not be identified.)Mikayla Nissan, a 16-year-old junior who was walking with friends on Millburn Avenue toward the center of downtown, said hazing added needless anxiety about the first year in a new school.“It makes them nervous to come to the school,” she said of the freshmen. “They shouldn’t be nervous. High school is all about teachers helping you figure out what you want to do with your future. It should be a more comforting environment. You shouldn’t have to feel new and uncomfortable.”There have been no reports of injuries requiring medical attention, but experts say bullying can inflict long-lasting and severe damage.Lisa Ryan, whose daughter is a former member of the soccer team, said she had heard reports of egregious hazing in the past.“I was horrified,” Ms. Ryan said in a downtown parking lot. “They did get reprimanded.”One commenter on the Local, the New York Times blog covering Millburn, Maplewood and South Orange, N.J., said of school administrators: “They have an obligation to protect these new and more vulnerable students. The administration can’t continue to lay the responsibility for their inaction at the feet of a bunch of terrorized kids.” (The commenter, contacted by e-mail, asked to remain anonymous, saying, “My kid would never, ever feel safe in the school again.”)Asked if students caught with the list could be suspended, Dr. Miron said: “A senior with a slut list we would probably suspend. But it sounds so easy talking about it. When a kid says, ‘I just found it on the floor and picked it up,’ it becomes a little bit messier.”The school’s superintendent, Richard Brodow, sent an e-mail message to parents on Friday saying hazing was against school policy “and just plain wrong.”“We are encouraging any student who either has been a victim of or a witness to such behavior to please come forward,” Dr. Brodow wrote. “Those who are found to have engaged in this type of behavior will be disciplined. Parents, along with school personnel, must make it perfectly clear that hazing is wrong and we as a school community are better than that.”The school, which had a note on its bulletin board congratulating its 12 National Merit Scholarship semifinalists, was ranked first in the state in a recent survey by New Jersey Monthly magazine. But it has found itself in the news for less savory reasons a few times this year.In January, a fight in the school parking lot involving a minister and his sons and a baseball bat resulted in numerous criminal charges but no convictions. In March, school officials called in drug-sniffing dogs for a search that produced no illegal substances.As she was pulling away from the campus on Friday in a late-model S.U.V., one senior said she did not think the hazing this year was any worse than in past years, but “parents are taking it to an extreme level.”“Hazing has always been a tradition at Millburn,” she said. “It’s never really a personal attack. As a freshman you get pushed on the first day, and it reinforces the fact that they’re seniors.”She got pushed three years ago. Did she do any pushing this year? “Not more than anyone else,” she said.'"
"'09-09-19,'0','and other forms of cruelty to animals are illegal in all 50 states. The 1999 law was aimed solely at depictions of such conduct. A federal appeals court last year struck down the law on First Amendment grounds and overturned Mr. Stevens’s conviction.The law has an odd history. It was enacted in large part to address what a House report called “a very specific sexual fetish.” There are people, it seems, who enjoy watching videos of small animals being crushed.“Much of the material featured women inflicting the torture with their bare feet or while wearing high-heeled shoes,” according to the report. “In some video depictions, the woman’s voice can be heard talking to the animals in a kind of dominatrix patter.”When President Bill Clinton signed the bill, he expressed reservations prompted by the First Amendment and instructed the Justice Department to limit prosecutions to “wanton cruelty to animals designed to appeal to a prurient interest in sex.”But the Justice Department in the Bush administration pursued at least three prosecutions for the sale of dogfighting videos.There is little dispute that crush videos are profoundly disturbing. The two dogfighting videos Mr. Stevens was prosecuted for selling present a harder question.There was conflicting testimony at Mr. Stevens’s trial about the nature and social worth of the videos. Defense experts said the films had educational and historical value, noting that much of the footage came from , where dogfighting is legal. A veterinarian who testified for the prosecution disputed that and said the videos depicted terrible suffering, including scenes of dogs that were “bitten, ripped and torn” and “screaming in pain.”There is certainly biting in the dogfighting videos, but the fights are not bloody. In their Supreme Court brief, Mr. Stevens’s lawyers denied that any of the dogs in the videos were “ripped and torn,” and they counted “at most, 25 seconds containing yelps” in the more than two hours of footage on the tapes.The third video at issue in the case, “Catch Dogs and ,” shows pit bulls being trained to attack hogs and then hunting wild boar. The encounters are gory and brutal. Mr. Stevens participated in the hunting and filmed parts of the third video, which bears some resemblance to nature documentaries.The law applies to audio and video recordings of “conduct in which a living animal is intentionally maimed, mutilated, tortured, wounded or killed.” It does not matter whether the conduct was legal when and where it occurred so long as it would have been illegal where the recording was sold.That means it may be a crime for an American to sell a video of a bullfight that took place in , where bullfighting is legal. And because all hunting is illegal in Washington, a literal reading of the statute would make the sale of hunting videos illegal here. The law contains an exception for materials with “serious religious, political, scientific, educational, journalistic, historical or artistic value.”That exception may well protect journalism, scholarship and animal rights advocacy about subjects like , pharmaceutical testing, circuses and the slaughter of baby seals. But the determination of whether particular materials have “serious value” is, in the first instance at least, made by prosecutors.News organizations, including , filed a brief supporting Mr. Stevens. The 1999 law, the brief said, “imperils the media’s ability to report on issues related to animals.”In a brief supporting the government, the Humane Society of the United States said that “gruesome depictions of animal mutilation targeted” by the law “simply do not merit the dignity of full First Amendment protection.”When federal agents raided Mr. Stevens’s home in rural in 2003, he had no idea, his lawyers and family say, that he was breaking the law.But there are hints in the videotapes that Mr. Stevens at least knew that people participating in dogfighting in the were doing something illegal.“Because I’m not going to show any participants or spectators, I have to cut a lot of it,” Mr. Stevens, who has a folksy manner and looks a little like the actor , said on one of the videos. “I only show certain action clips I think you’ll enjoy.” Mr. Stevens did not try to hide the identities of those involved in the Japanese dogfights or in the video of dogs attacking hogs.There is a crucial difference, Mr. Stevens’s lawyers told the Supreme Court, between illegal conduct and depictions of that conduct.“While acts of animal cruelty have long been outlawed,” the brief for Mr. Stevens said, “there have never been any laws against speech depicting the killing or wounding of animals from the time of the First Amendment’s adoption through the intervening two centuries.”State and local governments occasionally try to ban depictions of violence against people, notably in videogames. But those laws are routinely struck down, and the Supreme Court has never ruled that speech about nonsexual violence is beyond the protection of the First Amendment.Mr. Stevens’s sentence was 14 months longer, the brief noted, than that of , the football star who actually participated in a dogfighting venture.Through his lawyers, Mr. Stevens declined to be interviewed. He has said he never had his own dogs participate in dogfights.Mr. Stevens’s son, Michael, said his father was guilty of nothing more than a longtime fascination with the affection, loyalty and passion of pit bulls. “You couldn’t treat a dog any better,” the younger Mr. Stevens said, “than my father treats pit bull dogs.”'"

Such denials frequently result in costs being shifted to state Medicaid programs or Medicare.In the debate over health care reform, we should discuss whether the proposals will correct abuses like these.For insurers, covering the expensive solution but not the cheap one is an old practice.In 1987, after breaking both legs, I had to go for a follow-up visit to the hospital.

"'09-09-19,'0','In August 2008, Vivian Girls played a dense, sweaty show at the Williamsburg, Brooklyn, playpen Death by Audio. On the right of the stage was Cassie Ramone, the band’s guitarist, primary vocalist and sole songwriter, dour behind bangs and spending a lot of time looking down at the ground, or maybe at her guitar. On the left was Kickball Katy, the bass player, who looked eager and happy. In the rear, a little shy behind her drum kit, was Ali Koehler, who had joined the band only a month before. The songs were short, sticky, droning, improbably sweet. The show didn’t even nudge the half-hour mark.A few weeks ago, in late August, Vivian Girls played a dense, sweaty show at the Williamsburg, Brooklyn, playpen Death by Audio. This time Ms. Ramone was on the left, Kickball Katy was on the right, and Ms. Koehler wore her hair up. (It was unreasonably hot.) The songs, and set, were a little longer. In the intervening year the walls of the club appeared to have been painted; the ceiling was still questionable, though.Yet for a band that often appears to be running in place, or perhaps just stuck, Vivian Girls have seen almost nothing but tumult in the year leading to their second album, “Everything Goes Wrong” (In the Red), which was released last week.Last summer this Brooklyn-via-New Jersey band was discovered, blogged about, praised to the rafters and then picked apart: a career life cycle in the span of a few weeks.Those are already the good old days, it turns out.“We were a lot more naïve then,” said Ms. Ramone, 23, on the phone this month from a rented Kia Sedona minivan somewhere in Montana, on the road between Billings and Missoula. “Logically it seems like a band younger in its career has more to prove, but now we have more to prove than we did before.”Such is the conundrum of the rapidly anointed and even more rapidly dismissed. Yet few bands work harder than those trapped in the hype cycle, especially in the Internet era. Groups that decades ago would have been local cult favorites remain cultish, but in multiple locales at once. “No matter where you go, no matter how small the community, it’s there,” said Kickball Katy, 25, who was born Katy Goodman. “They have it in Brooklyn; they have it in Provo, Utah.”Which means that Vivian Girls have been busy. They’ve played approximately 300 live shows in the 16 months since the initial, limited release of their self-titled debut album on Mauled by Tigers (the In the Red label did a wider release in October), a number that has kept them moving steadily but also fixed in place.“Everything Goes Wrong” was recorded over eight days in March, an epoch compared with the three days their first album took. “Vivian Girls” was a breezy and clangy mesh of garage and surf and noise and jangle, with prim girl-group harmonies hiding out beneath foggy reverb. Structurally, the songs were skeletal and brief: only 2 of 10 were longer than two and a half minutes, and most leaned on about that many chords. It was an untroubled album, a jubilant and refreshing first try.As with most divisive young bands, Vivian Girls were damned with comparisons. “A lot of people said we took our whole style from the C86 cassette,” Ms. Ramone complained, citing an early indie-rock compilation from the British music magazine NME. Previously, she said, she had never listened to the tape all the way through, but now she has: “I think with the exception of five songs, the tape’s not very good.” Nor had she paid much attention to the Shop Assistants or Black Tambourine, bands frequently invoked by her band’s acolytes and detractors. But still the linking continued: were Vivian Girls being faithful or just dismissible?They are aiming for neither. The new album captures improvement by a hundred baby steps. If “Vivian Girls” was, somewhat naïvely, about hope, “Everything Goes Wrong” is about melancholy. “The lyrics are always about Cassie stuff,” Ms. Ramone (born Cassie Grzymkowski) said, while avoiding specific discussion of what Cassie stuff might be, apart from an oblique acknowledgment of romantic difficulty. (In addition, Jamie Ewing, Ms. Ramone’s former band mate in Bossy, died last year.)“I don’t really feel comfortable sharing what the songs are about,” even with band members, she said. “It’s a trust exercise.”'"
"'09-09-19,'0','Now the subprime lenders are gone, and traditional banks are so reluctant to issue mortgages they demand large down payments. But the F.H.A., which works with thousands of lenders to guarantee repayment of mortgages loans, only requires a down payment of 3.5 percent.The agency’s share of the loan market has risen rapidly, to more than 20 percent. Some of those borrowers are losing their jobs and, as a result, their houses. The default rate on F.H.A. loans is rising. About 14.4 percent of the agency’s loans in the second quarter were at least one payment past due but short of foreclosure. That is twice the delinquency rate for top-quality or prime loans, at 6.4 percent.The F.H.A. has become the government equivalent of Countrywide Financial, the hyper-aggressive private lender that crashed two years ago, Mr. Yardeni said. “If you lend money to people with a low probability of paying you back, you shouldn’t be surprised if they don’t,” he said.F.H.A. officials said Friday that rumors swirling around its reserve fund were untrue.“There will be no taxpayer bailout, there will be no special appropriations, no legislation, no action requesting any additional funds whatsoever,” said David H. Stevens, the F.H.A.’s commissioner, in a conference call with reporters.Nevertheless, the agency is appointing its first chief risk officer since it was founded during the Great Depression, and is making several policy changes. These include raising requirements on F.H.A. lenders to make sure they have sufficient financial backing, and providing new guidelines on the independence of appraisers, who analyze the value of a home before a sale closes.At the F.D.I.C., the insurance fund fell to $10.4 billion at the end of the second quarter, the lowest level since the savings and loan crisis of the early 1990s.More than 90 banks have failed this year. Another two joined the list Friday: Irwin Union Bank of Louisville, Ky., and Irwin Union Bank and Trust of Columbus, Ind.The two banks, which had 27 branches between them, are subsidiaries of Irwin Financial Corporation. The F.D.I.C. estimated that the failures would cost its deposit insurance fund $850 million.Among the options for the F.D.I.C. to replenish its fund are levying a special fee on banks, tapping the Treasury or issuing its own debt, the F.D.I.C.’s chairwoman, Sheila C. Bair, said Friday at a conference at Georgetown University. Banks are opposed to a fee, but Ms. Bair expressed little enthusiasm for borrowing from the Treasury.“There is a philosophical question about the Treasury credit line, whether that is there for losses we know we will have or whether it’s there for unexpected emergencies,” Ms. Bair said.Those losses are likely to keep rising into the indefinite future, said Lou Barnes, a Boulder, Colo., mortgage banker.“Government life support is crucial, but the patient has an open artery and each new transfusion of blood is just running out onto the floor,” Mr. Barnes said.'"
"'09-09-19,'0','The bassist Trevor Dunn has a lot of experience making music of canny disruption and outrageous effect. He’s well entangled in a few different scenes, notably the one that includes the experimental-metal supergroup Fantomas and the one that revolves around the avant-garde polymath John Zorn. (There’s some overlap there.)To a certain kind of fan he’ll always be synonymous with Mr. Bungle, the spasmodic, surrealistic rock band he had a hand in forming in 1985. (There’s some overlap there, too.) His new band, MadLove, pursues a similar angle with starkly different results.At Southpaw in Brooklyn on Wednesday night, MadLove played most of the material from its debut album, “White With Foam,” released this month on Ipecac. The artful dissonances and angular meters in the music genuflected to prog-rock, while the chest-rattling bass drones suggested something more extreme. It was shrewdly designed and executed, but it didn’t all add up.The band’s problems start with its lead singer, Sunny Kim. Taking the stage in a gold lamé jacket over a black minidress, she looked the part of a frontwoman but exerted little presence or charisma. (It doesn’t help that Mr. Bungle had a dynamo in the hot seat: Mike Patton, also the mouthpiece of Fantomas and an owner of Ipecac.) And while Ms. Kim was pitch-accurate — a crucial thing, given the oblique intervals of a tune like “The Mute Number” — her sound often skewed pedestrian.And pedestrian is a particular liability when your band favors lyrics like these, from “Absence & Noise,” one of MadLove’s better songs: “Slight eternities that swim in your brain/Birth the larvae that survive in your veins.”Other songs brought images of black bile and razor wire, venom and “scabs of moonlight.” You need salesmanship for this sort of thing, but Mr. Dunn, who did some singing of his own, isn’t right for the job either.'"
"'09-09-19,'0','Russia and China so far have resisted taking strong diplomatic steps or imposing tougher sanctions against Iran. Mr. Obama’s decision to remove one of the main irritants in relations between Washington and Moscow seems intended, in part, to alter that diplomatic equation and help increase the chances of addressing the impasse over Iran without resorting to military force.But Mr. Obama was already facing a backlash on Friday from Congressional Republicans and politicians in Poland and the Czech Republic, nations that have looked to the United States for protection against what they perceive as Russian aggression.Mr. Obama’s decision on Thursday cancels an antimissile plan proposed by the Bush administration. Mr. Obama replaced the Bush system, which would have been based in Poland and the Czech Republic, with a reconfigured system designed to knock down short- and medium-range missiles instead of intercontinental ones.The Bush administration had said the system was intended to deter countries like Iran, but the Kremlin had long insisted that it was in fact aimed at Russia.Mr. Medvedev on Friday maintained that Russia did not feel obligated to respond to the United States as part of some deal. But he added: “There always is a score in politics. And if our partners hear some of our concerns, we will, of course, be more attentive to theirs.”Mr. Medvedev and Mr. Obama are to meet at the United Nations in New York next week.Russian officials did indicate that they would withdraw a proposal to base short-range missiles on Russia’s western border, in Kaliningrad, though American officials had not seemed very worried about that Russian plan.What else Russia might do to respond was a topic of speculation in both Washington and Moscow on Friday. One issue was whether the Kremlin, after more closely examining the new Obama antimissile plan, would voice new protests about it.Mr. Obama ordered the development of a system that would deploy smaller SM-3 missile interceptors in 2011, at first on ships, later on land in Europe. They are aimed mostly at short- and medium-range Iranian missiles. At least as currently designed, they are not capable of destroying Russia’s intercontinental missiles, though they are expected to be eventually upgraded, Obama administration officials said.The Obama plan calls for dozens and eventually possibly even hundreds of the smaller interceptors, not just the 10 larger ones included in Mr. Bush’s plan.Pavel Y. Felgenhauer, a military analyst who writes a column for Novaya Gazeta, an opposition newspaper in Moscow, said he doubted that the Kremlin would be able to complain about the new plan. Mr. Felgenhauer emphasized that the Kremlin had opposed the Bush system because it believed, on the advice of the Russian military, that the system was intended not to bring down Iranian missiles, but to give the United States the potential to make a crippling first strike against Russia.Also on Friday, in another sign of a warming in relations, NATO called for new cooperation with Moscow, including possibly on antimissile systems.In his first major foreign policy speech, which was coordinated with the White House, NATO’s new secretary general, Anders Fogh Rasmussen, proposed a “genuine new beginning of our relationship with Russia” and said the West and Russia had a shared interest in opposing proliferation of missile technology.Some Obama supporters in Washington said the remarks by Mr. Putin and Mr. Medvedev did not necessarily help Mr. Obama.“Critics will inevitably make hay of the positive comments,” said Mark Medish, a former Russia expert in the Clinton White House and now a scholar at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. “Much as in the Soviet days, Moscow’s praise can be seen as a political kiss of death for Western counterparts. But the criticism misses the point that Mr. Obama has made a hardheaded calculation based on U.S. national security interests and strategic priorities.”The Obama administration continued to use Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates, a Republican first appointed by Mr. Bush, to explain the new plan and deflect criticism. Mr. Gates met with the Czech defense minister, Martin Bartak, in Washington on Friday and offered more reassurances that the United States was not abandoning Eastern Europe.Even so, some analysts in Washington contended that Mr. Obama had sacrificed the Bush system in order to reach a broader arrangement with Russia that was by no means assured.Mr. Ellison, the missile defense advocate, said that if the mobile SM-3 interceptors that the Obama administration planned to deploy instead of the Bush system were genuinely effective, “the Russians should be much more concerned about having hundreds of interceptors in this system that could potentially shoot down missiles in and around Europe.”The fact that Russia is not, he said, “validates to me that the SM-3 system won’t be at that level for long-range ballistic missiles.”'"
"'09-09-19,'0','CORPORATE America loved its own stock when prices were high. When prices fell, the companies were no longer as interested in buying.Standard & Poor’s reported this week that stock buybacks by companies in the S.& P. 500 fell to $24.2 billion in the second quarter of 2009. That was down 28 percent from the first quarter and was 72 percent below the figure for the same quarter of 2008.The amount was also the lowest for any quarter since S.& P. began tallying the figures in 1998.Share buybacks were hailed by Wall Street as a way of returning cash to shareholders. Critics said they benefited only shareholders who sold, but advocates said they helped all holders by supporting the price.Share buybacks would clearly be beneficial to continuing investors if companies made them when their share prices were unreasonably depressed. But the pattern is the opposite; companies seem to buy stock when prices are high and times are good. When prices fall, they no longer have the money or, in some cases the confidence, to buy many shares.At the peak of the buyback boom, in the third quarter of 2007, companies in the S.& P. 500 spent $171.9 billion repurchasing shares. The stock market peaked on Oct. 9 of that year, a few days after the quarter ended.'"
"'09-09-19,'0','Intended to give primary caregivers the break they so often need, the grant money must be used to pay for temporary substitute care, said Carol Steinberg, executive vice president of the Alzheimer’s Foundation. Mrs. Egebrecht applied for and received the grant, which meant her mother could continue to go to the adult day care center and Mrs. Egebrecht had time to find another job, which she has.Mrs. Egebrecht is one of the growing numbers of Americans facing the financial squeeze that can come from caring for elderly parents.About 30 percent of adult children in the United States contribute financially to their parents’ care, according to the Pew Research Center. On average these children pay $2,400 a year on everything from uncovered medical expenses to making sure the refrigerator is stocked each week. The money often goes to parents who diligently saved all their lives, but in the face of longer life spans and chronic illness, the savings just isn’t enough.With all of the overwhelming emotional and medical aspects of caring for elderly parents, it’s natural to ignore the consequences of spending large amounts of money on them. But so often adult children end up ignoring their own savings and retirement accounts or, worse, go into debt, because they’re taking care of their parents, says Tim Casserly, a lawyer in Albany who specializes in issues of elderly care.And if you jeopardize your own finances now, you risk putting your children in the same tough spot down the line.One way out of this bind? Take full advantage of the hundreds of government and nonprofit programs and services geared to the elderly throughout the country. “There’s lots of help out there, but also lots of reasons why families don’t use it,” said Mr. Casserly.Some people may think their parents have too much money to qualify even though many of the programs are available to elderly people with incomes of more than $100,000. Or the parents may be too proud to accept help.What’s more, these services can be difficult and time-consuming to find. And it can be a challenge to deal with the paperwork and red tape, especially when you’re already overwhelmed by the daily demands of taking care of an older parent.To help make the search for help easier, here is expert advice and several resources that will help you find what you need to take care of your aging parents.THE FIRST STEP Have the hard talk.“So often I see clients who are in the middle of this situation but know very little about their parents’ finances,” said Henni Fisher, a Brooklyn clinical social worker who specializes in geriatrics. Your parents may be unwilling or unable to give details. Or you may be uncomfortable bringing up the subject.“It isn’t easy making the transition from the one being cared for to the one giving the care,” said Ms. Fisher.But you can’t put the conversation off any longer. Reassure your parents that you’re not trying to take control away from them. You’re simply trying to make sure that they have everything they need and that you understand everything they want.During this conversation, or series of conversations, be sure to ask about one of the largest expenses for older people: assisted living or nursing home facilities. Do your parents have long-term care insurance that can help with this monumental expense? If they don’t, should they get it? (For more information, see our previous article “Getting Insurance for One’s Frailest Years.” (There is a link to it with the online version of this column.)THE DOCUMENTS You’ll also want to make sure your parents have the proper paperwork in place. In an emergency, you’ll need legal authority to act on your parents behalf. Make sure your parents have signed a durable power of attorney authorizing you or some other trustworthy person to take over financial decisions — including signing checks and paying bills — on their behalf.And keep in mind these other necessary documents: A durable power of attorney for health care (also called a health care proxy) authorizing someone to make medical decisions when your parents cannot; and a living will outlining your parent’s wishes if life support is needed.These forms may be available at your local senior center. Or, a lawyer who focuses on elderly issues can answer questions and help put this paperwork in place. To find one near you, go to the National Academy of Elder Law Attorneys (www.naela.org). (If you live in New York State you may need a lawyer’s help sorting out a new 12-page complex power of attorney form, advises Mr. Casserly.)HIRING AN OUTSIDER Many families find relief when they hire a geriatric care manager. These consultants, which can cost anywhere from $50 to $200 an hour, will assess your parents’ situation, offer counseling and help you find the local services you need.So vital are these new professionals that my colleague Lesley Alderman will be devoting next week’s Patient Money column to tips on finding the right care manager for your parents’ situation.More resources can be found here.'"
"'09-09-19,'0','“Even turkeys are going to fly in a hurricane,” Mr. Harris said. “Those lower-quality companies are leading the charge here.”Financial companies and home builders have been among the biggest gainers in the recent run. Many of those companies still face major hurdles with bad debt and the weak housing market.The market’s run will slow but might not stop, according to many analysts, as investors shift their holdings from industries where the gains have been strong, like technology, to other areas that have lagged.The Dow rose 36.28, or 0.4 percent, to 9,820.20. The broader Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index rose 2.81, or 0.3 percent, to 1,068.30, while the Nasdaq composite index advanced 6.11, or 0.3 percent, to 2,132.86.For the week, the Dow rose 2.2 percent, while the S.& P. 500 and the Nasdaq advanced 2.5 percent.Bond prices fell, pushing yields higher. The Treasury’s benchmark 10-year note fell 21/32, to 101 11/32, and the yield rose to 3.46 percent from 3.38 percent late Thursday.The dollar was mixed against other major currencies, while gold prices fell.Crude oil fell 43 cents to settle at $72.04 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.Procter & Gamble rose $1.79, or 3.3 percent, to $57.32 after its upgrade from Citi Investment Research.Palm Inc. posted a wider fiscal first-quarter loss on Thursday and provided a disappointing sales forecast. Shares fell 43 cents Friday, or about 3 percent, to $14.01.Stocks rallied during the week in part because of improvements in economic reports on retail sales and manufacturing. Investors were also encouraged by a comment by the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, that the recession had “very likely” ended, though he warned that problems like high unemployment would linger.Many analysts still say the rally is due for a break. Linda A. Duessel, equity market strategist at Federated Investors in Pittsburgh, said a retreat of 10 percent or more in major stock indexes would not be surprising. The S.& P. 500 index has rocketed 57.9 percent from a 12-year low in early March. An advance that size might often take five or six years to occur.She said that even if there were slides, stocks were likely to resume climbing because so many investors had missed the rally.“The most common question I get when I travel is, ‘Do you think I’ll get a pullback so I can get in?’ That’s so bullish,” she said.Three stocks rose for every two that fell on the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 2.3 billion shares compared with 1.5 billion Thursday.Trading was heavy because of the occurrence of a quarterly “quadruple witching,” which marks the simultaneous expiration of four kinds of options and futures contracts.'"
"'09-09-19,'0','The Obama administration has said since it wants to repair ties with Moscow.The practical implications of Mr. Rasmussen’s comment on cooperation over missile defense were not clear. The alliance and Russia already cooperate on short-range missile defense systems.Asked if his comments had been approved by Washington, Mr. Rasmussen said he always consulted before major speeches and was confident that his speech was within framework of the alliance’s consensus.Referring to the American announcement on Thursday, Mr. Rasmussen, the former prime minister of Denmark, said that it was a misinterpretation to suggest that missile defense was being scrapped. “The new plans will make capabilities ready sooner than the previous plans and will provide us with broader coverage,"" he said.""It will make it possible to include all the allies and protect all the allies. So there is no reason to fear these plans will weaken the defense of any ally,” he said.He outlined other proposals on Friday, including joint NATO- Russia threat assessment and closer cooperation on anti-terrorism.Mr. Rasmussen also said he wants to revitalize the NATO-Russia Council. The council should, he said, provide ""a forum for serious dialogue.”Mr. Rasmussen’s decision to devote his first major speech to relations with Russia appeared designed to underline the message that NATO takes Moscow seriously as a global strategic partner. He did not mention Georgia and Ukraine, whose efforts to join the alliance were opposed by Russia.Later, however, he said there should be no going back on a decision to give them membership eventually.Mr. Rasmussen stressed the need for NATO and Russia to concentrate on issues on which they agree rather than those that divide them. “That implicitly moves Georgia and Ukraine down the agenda,” said one European diplomat speaking on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the subject.Dmitri V. Trenin, director of the Carnegie Moscow Center, said he thought the speech would produce “a positive reaction” in Russia since it followed the Obama administration’s announcement on missile defense.“It will strengthen those within the Russian leadership who want to reach out to the West,” he added.'"

"'09-09-20,'0','“Their attorney is with them,” said Ms. Aiello, who declined further comment.Earlier on Saturday, after Ms. Zazi declined to meet with the F.B.I. as planned, she said,“He’s at home,” adding that no plea arrangement was being negotiated on Mr. Zazi’s behalf.At the same time, The Denver Post reported on Saturday that Mr. Zazi said in a telephone interview that he had not admitted any link to Al Qaeda, to participation in insurgency training in Pakistan or to involvement in a terrorist plot.Government officials briefed on the matter have said that as Mr. Zazi voluntarily answered questions on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday, he admitted that he had perhaps unwittingly crossed paths in Pakistan with extremists allied with the terrorist organization. There were also indications that Mr. Zazi underwent training in explosives and bomb-making while overseas.“If it was true, they wouldn’t allow me to leave,” Mr. Zazi told The Denver Post. I don’t think the F.B.I. or the police would allow anyone who admits being a terrorist to go free for one minute.”In an investigation that went from covert to overt last week, the authorities were moving quickly to check clues and track the movements of Mr. Zazi and those associated with him — even as they moved in federal court to file affidavits in support of the arrests.On Monday, the authorities raided four residences connected to Mr. Zazi in Queens, New York, and later executed search warrants his home in Aurora, Colo., and the home of his relatives there.Investigators were poring over is Mr. Zazi’s laptop computer, officials said. They have copied or mirrored the hard drive of the device and are looking for e-mails, downloaded material and any trail of Internet sites that had been visited in an effort to determine whether their suspicions about him are warranted. The search of the hard drive did yield information about searches of sites connected to public gatherings in New York.However, investigators have not yet determined what Mr. Zazi’s apparent interest in those sites suggests.Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. has been briefed regularly on the status of the investigation, as has the F.B.I. director, Robert S. Mueller III, and officials at the White House and Pentagon.Aside from news of Mr. Zazi’s arrest, several people in New York have been questioned in the case. Three men at a fifth-floor apartment on 41st Avenue, in Flushing, Queens, described how they had been interrogated on at least three separate occasions since their home was raided about 2 a.m. Monday.Naiz Khan, 26, said he was interviewed for eight hours Thursday at what he believed was the Brooklyn offices of the United States attorney for the Eastern District. He said he voluntarily provided his fingerprints, DNA samples and prints of the soles of his shoes. A roommate, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said he submitted to a similar interrogation.Each man described how they were repeatedly asked series of questions about Mr. Zazi, who they said had spent the night of Sept. 10 sleeping in their apartment.As they spoke in their home on Saturday, the men said they were not terrorists. Mr. Khan said he had spoken to Mr. Zazi only occasionally in recent years and the other man said he had yet to meet him. Mr. Khan said he doubted Mr. Zazi was a terrorist and expressed frustration over the fallout from his visit.“He put us into trouble,” he said. “Why do they have to bother me and my roommates? Why do they have to go to my fathers house?”A defense lawyer with experience in terrorism cases in New York said that three men that he knew of who had had contact with Mr. Zazi had been questioned and fingerprinted by federal authorities.Robert Nardoza, a spokesman for the United States attorney in Brooklyn, Benton J. Campbell, would neither confirm nor deny the questioning.Mr. Khan said he had not retained a lawyer.As he spoke he displayed a several pages of search warrants that agents left with him after the Monday raid. The court papers outlined two pages of items to be seized, specifying that they wanted anything to do with explosives or their building blocks: chemicals, fusing caps, timers or blasting caps, among other things.But the papers also listed what the authorities left with: cellphones; a laptop computer; papers and notebooks with Arabic writing; tools; 100 tongue depressors; a Con Edison bill; immigration papers and nine backpacks.New York Police Department officers returned on Tuesday and took a green nylon suitcase from a back bedroom, said Mr. Khan. He said his uncle Faiz Mohammed had packed the backpacks into the green suitcase and was planning to bring them to Karachi, Pakistan, for his children and those of his brother.Mr. Khan also said the authorities asked him whether he had gone to rent a U-Haul on Sept. 9 in Queens and he emphatically said he did not.“They said, ‘Did you go to U-Haul?’ and I said, ‘No,’ ” said Mr. Khan. “ ‘Did you pack anything, did you store anything in the U-Haul?’ I said, ‘No.’ ”Ronald L. Kuby, a lawyer, said that Ahmad Afzali, an imam in a mosque in Queens, did not rent any truck from U-Haul, though he, too, was questioned by agents in the recent days.“He has not been in a U-Haul facility since 2004, when he rented a truck to help move his family,” Mr. Kuby said.'"
"'09-09-20,'0','While Lehman was not itself a bank with a key position in the payment system — which other banks rely on as an intermediary when making payments to one another — Lehman’s financial dealings with such key banks made those banks’ financial positions very sensitive to a shift in confidence.And if confidence were shaken, deposits and other short-term financing could be withdrawn at short notice, causing such a bank to fail. The mere rumor that a key bank had material business with Lehman could have had huge effects.The Fed and the Treasury should have taken over Lehman to safeguard the smooth functioning of the payment system. Shareholders would have absorbed losses first, and senior management would have been replaced.The idea that Congress would not have passed the bailout if Lehman had been seized and stabilized, while tantalizing, ignores the fact that various other key banks and financial institutions were also on the brink. And with Lehman stabilized, Congress would have had more time and, perhaps, passed better legislation.The unfairness lies not in Lehman Brothers’ being allowed to fail, but in the bailout of other firms like Bear Stearns, Citigroup and AIG.If bank holding companies like Citigroup had failed instead of being rescued, their separately incorporated and well-capitalized commercial bank subsidiaries would have simply continued in business under new ownership, with no necessary losses to depositors or the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.Last year Ben Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, and Henry M. Paulson Jr., Treasury secretary at the time, did irreparable harm to the principle of financial responsibility. The Senate should resoundingly reject Mr. Bernanke’s nomination for a second term.The writer is a professor of economics and finance at Ohio State University.Some may question the memory of this 85-year-old, yet I have no doubt that less than a year ago the nation was being assured by government officials that the huge bailouts of financial institutions were necessary because — in the interest of avoiding a national disaster — those institutions were too large to be allowed to fail.Despite that, our government has permitted (or encouraged) some banks to gobble up others. For example, JPMorgan Chase acquired Washington Mutual, and Bank of America absorbed Merrill Lynch.So I was dismayed that your suggestions in “Reforming the Financial System” (editorial, Sept. 14) did not include reducing the size of financial institutions in order to minimize the chances of future huge bailouts at taxpayer expense.Re “Robbed by the Bank,” by Jane Pedreira, who was laid off from Lehman Brothers a week before it went bankrupt (Op-Ed, Sept. 15):Ms. Pedreira’s self-pitying line — “did I deserve to be robbed because of the mistakes of others?” — would be more appropriate posted on the hundreds of thousands of houses in foreclosure.Compensation at investment banks is tied to the game of gambling with other people’s money: heads I win, tails you lose.Now that the downside has finally become clear, we’re being told by some on Wall Street that it’s a bad idea to limit bonuses because employees might run away, as if they were rare specimens who must be cultivated at any cost. Wrong! These are ordinary, easily replaceable people.The really rare specimens on which our civilization depends are those who are motivated by a passion for their work, from researchers to kindergarten teachers. These are the ones we must cultivate; if not, we are doomed.It was a single person who insisted that some of the culprits in our financial calamity not only be identified but actually be held accountable. It wasn’t the executive branch, or the regulators, or Congress. It was Judge Jed S. Rakoff.All those who are interested in equality before the law should be grateful to our founding fathers for their wisdom in establishing an independent third branch of government that isn’t susceptible to campaign contributions and lobbying. He is the kind of judge they envisioned, and he has met their highest expectations.The writer is a lecturer at the School of Law at the University of California, Berkeley.Ben Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, says that the recession is “very likely” over and that it may be months before unemployment starts to drop. That’s like saying the cancer is cured when the patient dies.Let’s define “recession” so it means something real.'"

Any doubts have long since been put to rest: China is a world power in chess, particularly among women.China has produced three world champions — Xie, Zhu Chen in 2001-4 and Xu Yuhua from 2006-8 — and has four of the world’s top 20 players.China reaffirmed its status at the Women’s World Team Championship in Yingbo, China, Sept. 2-11. It fielded two squads in the 10-team competition, and its A team edged out Russia and Ukraine for the title after an unusual finish.In the last round, China, needing a tie match to win the tournament, faced Vietnam, the last-place team. All four games were hard-fought and ended in draws. But, in one of the games, the Vietnamese player was winning at the end when she unexpectedly proposed a draw, which clinched the title for China.The United States team fared poorly, ending in eighth place. But it had the satisfaction of winning its sixth-round match against the Chinese A team, 3 to 1. Alisa Melekhina was a bright spot for the United States, playing well throughout the tournament and collecting a gold medal. Against China, she demolished Huang Qian.'"
"'09-09-20,'0','Chira said that, with the situation in Afghanistan “deteriorating by the minute,” she has recommended a full-time security consultant in Kabul, as The Times has in , where it spends more than $3 million a year maintaining an extensive operation with 24-hour armed protection. William Schmidt, a deputy managing editor, said the paper has hired a retired military officer to make yet another assessment. Bill Keller, the executive editor, said the paper is circulating stricter rules for travel in Afghanistan.In the meantime, the editors refuse to second-guess Farrell’s decision to go to the site where bombs incinerated two hijacked fuel trucks, killing Taliban fighters but also many civilians — an important story at a time when such incidents threaten to turn Afghans against the NATO allies.“I wasn’t there, and I don’t feel qualified to second-guess his judgments,” Keller said. “But I have seen no evidence that his reporting mission was reckless or irresponsible.”Farrell, a veteran war correspondent, said that before setting off from Kabul, he had extensive discussions with Richard Oppel, a Times colleague in the bureau, and the Afghan staff. He said two drivers spoke with people who knew the route and “agreed that the journey was manageable.” The plan was to drive straight through to a relatively safe destination, the hospital in Kunduz where the injured were being treated.Farrell said the trip was so uneventful that Munadi, a respected journalist in his own right, felt confident stopping for a hitchhiker near the village where the airstrike occurred, to pick his brain. Farther on, at dusk, they came to an Afghan police checkpoint. Contrary to Miliband’s assertion, Farrell told me the only warning he got came from a policeman who said it would not be safe to go to the scene of the airstrike because darkness was approaching. “Common sense,” Farrell said, and he had no intention of doing so that evening anyway.After interviewing patients at the hospital, he talked with James Bays, a British reporter working for ’s English-language service, who had gone that afternoon to a village where bodies from the bombing were being laid out. Bays said he told Farrell it had felt “dodgy,” and he left. Farrell said he decided to avoid the nearby villages the next morning and go instead to the site of the bombing, some distance away. Munadi and the driver spoke with several people in Kunduz and seemed satisfied that it would be a “reasonable risk,” he said.The driver, whom The Times has not identified to protect his safety, was quoted in The as saying that the police and village elders had warned them not to go to the scene and that he was scared. When the Taliban approached, the three initially ran, but the driver kept going with the car keys, stranding Farrell and Munadi.Farrell said he would not have overruled the Afghan staff and was comfortable with the decision to go. But they stayed “fractionally too late,” he said.Like Keller, I was not there, and I cannot make the judgment — as so many do without all the facts — that Farrell acted recklessly. War reporting under the best circumstances is dangerous, and a risk that seems reasonable one moment can turn tragic the next. “You can do X 100 times,” said , a deputy foreign editor who consulted with Farrell before he went to the site, “and do it 101 and be dead.”The Times won a earlier this year for its coverage from Afghanistan and . While reporting one of the articles, a freelance reporter and a photographer were held by the Taliban for two days. For another, and a photographer ventured into Pakistan’s lawless tribal region — passing a sign reading “Entry by Foreigners Prohibited Beyond This Point” — to meet a Taliban commander, who was gunned down weeks later by one of his bodyguards in the same room.After Farrell’s rescue, a debate broke out in the British press over whether he had been “too grand” to take a safer route and embed with the British or American military. But embedding does not eliminate the risk. Just ask my former colleague Jonathan Landay of McClatchy Newspapers, who was caught in a Taliban ambush three days after Farrell was kidnapped. Four were killed and three Americans and 19 Afghan soldiers were wounded. And independent reporting is often the only way to uncover truths that governments and militaries do not want the public to know, like the carnage from airstrikes.Though The Times does not want to second-guess, it has issues to address as it reviews its operations in Afghanistan. Among them: whether there is a clear structure through which go, no-go decisions are made, the training of the Afghan staff, and whether, as in Iraq, the bureau is sufficiently plugged into the network of contractors and intelligence operatives who share real-time information on security threats.But even with the best precautions, covering war can exact horrible costs.“I am distraught that a reporting mission which was intended to find out if avoidable deaths had been caused, led, through a catastrophic series of events, to more deaths,” Farrell told me. “No one can know in advance which calculated risks they take will work out well, and which will go wrong. I will have to live with the consequences of my actions.”'"
"'09-09-20,'0','Steady technological advances in our missile defense program — from kill vehicles to the abilities to network radars and sensors — give us confidence in this plan. The SM-3 has had eight successful tests since 2007, and we will continue to develop it to give it the capacity to intercept long-range missiles like ICBMs. It is now more than able to deal with the threat from multiple short- and medium-range missiles — a very real threat to our allies and some 80,000 American troops based in Europe that was not addressed by the previous plan. Even so, our military will continue research and development on a two-stage ground-based interceptor, the kind that was planned to be put in Poland, as a back-up.Moreover, a fixed radar site like the one previously envisioned for the Czech Republic would be far less adaptable than the airborne, space- and ground-based sensors we now plan to use. These systems provide much more accurate data, offer more early warning and tracking options, and have stronger networking capacity — a key factor in any system that relies on partner countries. This system can also better use radars that are already operating across the globe, like updated cold war-era installations, our newer arrays based on high-powered X-band radar, allied systems and possibly even Russian radars.One criticism of this plan is that we are relying too much on new intelligence holding that Iran is focusing more on short- and medium-range weapons and not progressing on intercontinental missiles. Having spent most of my career at the C.I.A., I am all too familiar with the pitfalls of over-reliance on intelligence assessments that can become outdated. As Gen. James Cartwright, the vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said a few days ago, we would be surprised if the assessments did not change because “the enemy gets a vote.”The new approach to European missile defense actually provides us with greater flexibility to adapt as new threats develop and old ones recede. For example, the new proposal provides some antimissile capacity very soon — a hedge against Iran’s managing to field missiles much earlier than had been previously predicted. The old plan offered nothing for almost a decade.Those who say we are scrapping missile defense in Europe are either misinformed or misrepresenting what we are doing. This shift has even been distorted as some sort of concession to Russia, which has fiercely opposed the old plan. Russia’s attitude and possible reaction played no part in my recommendation to the president on this issue. Of course, considering Russia’s past hostility toward American missile defense in Europe, if Russia’s leaders embrace this plan, then that will be an unexpected — and welcome — change of policy on their part. But in any case the facts are clear: American missile defense on the continent will continue, and not just in Central Europe, the most likely location for future SM-3 sites, but, we hope, in other NATO countries as well.This proposal is, simply put, a better way forward — as was recognized by Prime Minister Donald Tusk of Poland when he called it “a chance for strengthening Europe’s security.” It is a very real manifestation of our continued commitment to our NATO allies in Europe — iron-clad proof that the United States believes that the alliance must remain firm.I am often characterized as “pragmatic.” I believe this is a very pragmatic proposal. I have found since taking this post that when it comes to missile defense, some hold a view bordering on theology that regards any change of plans or any cancellation of a program as abandonment or even breaking faith. I encountered this in the debate over the Defense Department’s budget for the fiscal year 2010 when I ended three programs: the airborne laser, the multiple-kill vehicle and the kinetic energy interceptor. All were plainly unworkable, prohibitively expensive and could never be practically deployed — but had nonetheless acquired a devoted following.I have been a strong supporter of missile defense ever since President Ronald Reagan first proposed it in 1983. But I want to have real capacity as soon as possible, and to take maximum advantage of new technologies to combat future threats.The bottom line is that there will be American missile defense in Europe to protect our troops there and our NATO allies. The new proposal provides needed capacity years earlier than the original plan, and will provide even more robust protection against longer-range threats on about the same timeline as the previous program. We are strengthening — not scrapping — missile defense in Europe.'"
"'09-09-20,'0','What price beauty? More consumers appear to be asking this question as they rein in their spending.Total sales of department-store beauty products were $3.7 billion in the first half of the year, down 7 percent compared with the period a year earlier, according the NPD Group, a market research firm. That includes skin care, makeup, and fragrances for both men and women.Makeup companies may be worrying that women are taking “the natural look” to extremes they never intended.But one reason for the drop could be that some people are selectively replacing higher-priced items with cheaper products from drug stores and discount stores, said Karen Grant, vice president and global industry analyst for NPD.Some new products were a bright spot for the department stores. For example, foundations, concealers, blushes, mascaras and lipsticks that were introduced in the period all showed sales increases, while the same-old same-old products tended to decline.'"
"'09-09-20,'0','The Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission, created by Congress to examine the causes of the crisis, held its first public meeting last week. In his opening remarks, the chairman, Phil Angelides, a former California state treasurer, likened the group’s potential impact to that of the Pecora hearings in the 1930s, which examined the stock market crash of 1929 and led to transformational changes in banking, investing and financial regulation.And yet, last week’s meeting was oddly inauspicious, feeding doubts about the commission’s ability to realize that potential.For starters, the meeting was a long time coming, and thin on substance. It has been four months since Congress passed a law authorizing the commission and two months since lawmakers selected its 10 commissioners  six chosen by the Democratic leadership and four by the Republican leadership.Just days before the meeting, Mr. Angelides announced the hiring of the commission’s executive director, Thomas Greene, a chief assistant attorney general in California. Mr. Greene has performed ably in various cases, including those involving antitrust issues against Microsoft and civil prosecutions of Enron. But he will need to hire tough Wall Street experts to assist him. He may also find himself hobbled by restraints on his subpoena power, because the commission rules, written by Congress, require that Democrats and Republicans on the commission agree before subpoenas can be issued.The meeting itself was mainly prepared statements from commission members, describing the group’s mission and expressing their commitment to a full investigation. In their more enlightening moments, some of the commissioners previewed specific concerns to pursue  like the role in the crisis of derivatives, of Fannie Mae and other too-big-to-fail institutions, and of the Federal Reserve and other regulators.But the real work  gathering documents and taking testimony from financial executives and government officials  will not start before November. Public hearings are not expected until December. A final report is due to Congress on Dec. 15, 2010.Is that slow start an early sign of drift? Does it reflect the apparent ambivalence of lawmakers to rein in the banks?To dispel such questions, the commission will have to start now to mount a rigorous inquiry that explains both the underlying and immediate causes of the crisis. Stretching back decades, which beliefs and policies  especially deregulatory efforts  allowed for the tremendous growth of finance as a share of the economy, and for the increasing reliance on debt as the engine of economic growth?Providing historical context will be easy compared with investigating more recent events, because near-term events involve people still in power. In the run-up to the crisis, what did regulators, particularly the Federal Reserve, know and do in response to unconstrained lending? What were their thoughts about the way banks and investors worldwide increasingly disregarded risk?Publicly, they did not act to curb the excesses. But internally, was there contrary analysis or dissent? Were there chances to take another course that we may learn from now in hindsight?Answers to these questions are in files that are not public and in the heads of the people in positions of responsibility at the time. The commission must be aggressive in its pursuit of documents and unflinching in taking testimony at even the highest levels of government and business.The commission must also trace the facts and circumstances that connect the implosions of Bear Stearns, Fannie Mae, Lehman Brothers and the American International Group. What were the terms of the derivatives contracts between A.I.G. and its counterparties, like Goldman Sachs, which received $12.9 billion via the A.I.G. bailout? What was revealed in the meetings that resulted in the A.I.G. bailout and in the subsequent $700 billion taxpayer-provided lifeline for financial firms? Why was Citigroup, a failing institution last year, treated more favorably than A.I.G.? And to what extent have the survivors of the crash, like Goldman and JPMorgan Chase, benefited from cheap financing, loan guarantees and other government interventions?In the months since the inquiry commission was created last May, other significant efforts have been undertaken to get to the bottom of the financial crisis.Judge Jed Rakoff of the United States District Court in New York has demanded that Bank of America and the Securities and Exchange Commission be more forthcoming about the identities of bank officials who may have withheld from shareholders important information relating to BofA’s purchase of Merrill Lynch at the height of the financial crisis.Bloomberg News has filed a Freedom of Information suit to learn the identities of banks that took emergency funding from the Fed, the amounts and the collateral they offered. The judge in that case has told the Fed to release the names; the Fed has until the end of September to appeal the decision. The Fed should not appeal. The truth will come out, and in the end, the nation will be better for it.The commission can take its cue from those efforts. Probing questions, asked in order to advance the public interest and with a goal of ever greater transparency, are what Americans have a right to expect  and what the commission, if it so chooses, can deliver.'"
"'09-09-20,'0','Few were indifferent to President Obama’s cancellation last week of a plan by his predecessor to put defenses against intercontinental ballistic missiles, presumably from Iran, in Eastern Europe. From Republicans, there was fury. From Russia’s leaders, praise. From critics who see its replacement as costly, unnecessary and unreliable, disappointment.The president’s defense secretary, Robert M. Gates, had supported the plan while serving George W. Bush. But new intelligence, he said, led him to a different conclusion: Iran poses a more immediate threat to neighbors and parts of Europe with shorter-range missiles, a threat that should be countered quickly and from sites closer to Iran.The Bush plan had its roots in Ronald Reagan’s vision for a space-based defense against missiles — dubbed “Star Wars” by critics — that collapsed under the weight of its myriad technical challenges.Star Wars evolved into an earthbound system that exists today in Alaska and California, a multibillion dollar answer to a potential attack by North Korea. An update of that installation, in Poland and the Czech Republic, would have taken nearly a decade to complete.Skeptics remain legion, not least because the existing sites have a spotty history of performance in testing. Advocates have faith in eventual technical success and say that the European plan was also a bulwark against potential Russian adventurism, recalling last year’s battles in Georgia.Here are highlights of the Bush plan, and the one President Obama is putting in its place.'"
"'09-09-20,'0','In a country inclined to celebrate its frontier roots and rugged individualism, how much shock is required before Americans opt to increase the powers of the sheriff? Fear does have a way of inducing change. Eight years ago, when terrorists slammed jets into the World Trade Center, the trauma was so powerful that it appeared to alter cultural norms. Without the spectacle of ordinary people plunging to their deaths, it seems difficult to imagine the United States wiretapping citizens without warrants and waterboarding people in the interest of national security.In the first months of the contemporary financial disaster — as fear descended on financial markets and economists worried about a repeat of the Depression — some assumed that the United States was suffering the financial equivalent of 9/11. Life savings were sliced in half, millions of workers lost their jobs, and homeowners confronted foreclosure. Years of anticipating better days gave way to economic anxiety.In some quarters, the sense took hold that household wealth had been looted by Wall Street while the regulators sat mute. Financial institutions had been allowed to operate a casino, using mortgage-backed securities and derivatives as chips, collecting the profits while sticking the taxpayer with the eventual losses.Surely, it seemed, pain and populist anger had altered the balance between trust in the market and the desirability of oversight. Even Alan Greenspan, the long-time Federal Reserve chairman and apostle for laissez-faire, confessed that his faith had been shaken; at one point he suggested that the government might need to nationalize major banks.History, too, seemed to indicate that change was on the way. After the Panic of 1873 — which saw a run of bank failures, the shutdown of the New York Stock Exchange and soaring unemployment — labor unrest lasted for decades.Three decades later, the Panic of 1907 saw prominent American lenders collapse, leading eventually to the creation of the Federal Reserve, a central bank to watch over all others.“Traditionally, the idea of a central bank had been repulsive,” said Kenneth S. Rogoff, a Harvard economist and co-author of an international survey of financial crises, “This Time Is Different: Eight Centuries of Financial Folly.”The Great Depression so tormented Americans that it delivered the New Deal, a muscular collection of government programs whose hallmarks — unemployment insurance and Social Security — remain the primary components of the modern-day social safety net. The banking crises of the 1930s prompted the passage of the Glass-Steagall Act, which divided investment banks from deposit-taking banks to prevent rampant speculation with ordinary people’s savings, while instituting government guarantees on deposits. (Many economists believe the final repeal of Glass-Steagall in 1999 played a key role in the reckless investment that triggered the latest crisis.)Memories of trauma can last a long time. Nearly a century has passed since Germany suffered the hyperinflation that helped set the stage for Hitler; yet even today, fear of rising prices remains the primary force in contemporary German policy. Earlier this year, governments from Washington to Beijing unleashed government spending to spur economic activity. Not Germany, ever vigilant against triggering an upward spiral of prices.The shock that accompanied the end of the American real estate boom once seemed a sentinel event that would bring tighter government scrutiny of the financial realm. Yet as fear of catastrophe fades, the question is how quickly the momentum in Washington for tighter financial rules is diminishing and whether unemployed workers and strapped homeowners will feed a groundswell for change strong enough to offset government turf wars and the influence of financial industry lobbyists.In Washington, on Wall Street and on Main Street, many are aware that the era of lightly supervised markets was fabulously lucrative for those positioned to capture a piece. Financial services and real estate — nurtured by easy money — swelled into major sources of employment, while boosting stock portfolios for huge institutions and ordinary people alike. New York cemented itself as the global financial capital.Over the last quarter-century, moreover, the traditional faith in unfettered markets deepened, and became entwined with the belief in the abundance of American opportunity, reinforcing a justification for laissez-faire: In a land that subscribes to the Horatio Alger story — in which anyone can supposedly make it — the market can be trusted to make the rules. For Milton Friedman, the most influential economic thinker of the last half-century, political and economic freedom were synonymous.“There are a lot of complex emotions at work,” Mr. Rogoff said. “Certainly, we’re terrified of the crisis. On the other hand, the United States has been a big winner in the global financial arena, and why change the rules when you’re winning?”Such sentiments carried the day a decade ago, after the near-collapse of the giant hedge fund Long Term Capital Management, which had attracted billions of dollars with the story that its sophisticated computer models had tamed risk. Its failure held the potential to drag down many of its trading partners.Then, as now, some warned that the near-disaster was a harbinger of worse ahead, if reforms were not put in place that limited how much borrowed money could be employed. But Mr. Greenspan, joined by the Clinton administration Treasury Secretaries Robert Rubin and Lawrence Summers, scotched proposals for new rules, arguing that they would stifle American strength.Even the mere consideration of regulations for derivatives ran the risk of prompting investors to take their money overseas “because of a perception that the American regulatory environment is inhospitable,” warned Mr. Summers, who is now a leading economic adviser to President Obama.Mr. Greenspan delivered the overarching argument for an economy built on optimism, not worry.“You can have huge amounts of regulation and I will guarantee nothing will go wrong,” Mr. Greenspan told Congress, “but nothing will go right either.”Mr. Summers, for his part, now likens the impact of the recent crisis to that of the Cuban missile crisis in generating demands for arms control. “The events of the past two years have raised grave concerns about the soundness of public policy as it regards the financial system,” he said on Friday, in a speech at Georgetown University McDonough School of Business. “It is critical to move rapidly while the events of the last two years are clearly in mind.”So the question now is how many people have similarly changed their sense of what the American economy needs. Mostly, it is a matter of whether the country is still feeling lucky; whether the recent crisis will come to feel like an unavoidable toll on the highway to fortune, or whether something deeper has shifted in the American psyche, leaving us shaken in a lasting way.'"
"'09-09-20,'0','In successive financial boom-busts over the past 30 years, the Fed undertook smaller versions of what Ben Bernanke did over the past 12 months. In the Latin American debt crisis of 1982, the savings-and-loan crisis of the late 1980s, the Asian financial crisis and the collapse of Long-Term Capital Management in 1998 and during the bursting of the dot-com bubble in 2001, you saw the same pattern: First, of course, the financial system grew rapidly, bank profits were large and a bubble emerged. At a certain point, we reached the market peak and stared down the mountain. Bankers frantically called the Fed, and it dutifully stepped in to prevent an economic collapse — by lowering interest rates and providing credit to “maintain liquidity.”In his speech last week, Mr. Bernanke indicated that interest rates are now likely to stay low for a long time. That means that if you are running a major bank, you have good reason now to take on more “leverage” (debt). If collapse threatens again, bank executives know the Fed will support them. And lenders know that it is a far better risk to make loans to banks supported by the Fed than to firms that can go bankrupt, like automakers or high-technology companies.All of this facilitates a short-term recovery, of course, and is the cornerstone of Mr. Bernanke’s strategy. But it also feeds a new financial frenzy — making it harder to sustain real growth, and also making it less likely that a broad cross section of society will benefit.There is nothing wrong with having the Federal Reserve in place to deal with financial shocks. This was the original idea that emerged from the 1907 financial crisis, and from the subsequent National Monetary Commission reports — that the United States needed a central bank to manage downturns. At that time, Democrats were rightly suspicious that the commission, led by Senator Nelson Aldrich, Republican of Rhode Island, was looking for a way to give private banking interests influence over federal money.When it was created in 1913, the Federal Reserve was meant to be a compromise — a way for private bankers to have a say in the operation of the national bank but also a way for the government to keep private bankers in check. And that is how it worked from 1935 to 1980, when the Fed and other agencies ensured that banks’ activities did not put the public purse at risk.Both before 1935 and again after 1980, however, the Fed’s financial regulation was and has been weak. At the heart of this weakness are the large profits that can be earned by taking advantage of lax regulation in the financial sector. The phenomenal growth of the derivatives market over the past 30 years, for example, has made all our big banks far more interconnected, and hence systemically risky; if one bank falls the others fall with it. Yet our regulators, many of whom remain in office today, watched as this time bomb grew and then exploded with the collapse of the American International Group.Since our top regulators are political appointees, it should be no surprise that, in the face of heavy lobbying by the financial sector, they often turn out to be regulatory doves. We’ve permitted our mid- and high-level regulators to revolve between jobs in finance and officialdom. To name just two examples, during the Clinton administration, Robert Rubin left Goldman Sachs to become secretary of the Treasury, then returned to the industry to take an oversight role at Citigroup, while Henry Paulson, the secretary of the Treasury during the last years of the George W. Bush administration, came straight to government from Goldman Sachs.A high-level position at the Federal Reserve, the Treasury, the White House National Economic Council or at a Congressional committee overseeing banking can be a ticket to riches when public service is done. The result is that our main regulatory bodies, including the Fed, are deeply compromised. Rather than act as the tough overseers of the public purse that we need — and that we had before 1980 — they have become cheerleaders for the financial sector.These cheerleaders, in turn, generate financial cycles by letting our financial system grow too fast, with far too little capital for the risks it takes. When the Federal Reserve inevitably bails banks out, it receives great applause (particularly from the financial sector). Yet with each cycle of failure and bailout, the financial system grows ever larger and more dangerous.Not all of this, of course, is under Ben Bernanke’s control. Like Alan Greenspan before him, when he provides bailouts and facilitates recovery, Mr. Bernanke can say he is only doing his job. But the true and original responsibility of the Fed is much broader that that. The central bank is supposed to prevent crises that threaten to bankrupt the country.In today’s nascent global recovery, we are already seeing bubble-like rises in the prices of real estate and assets, from Hong Kong and Singapore to Brazil. And many more emerging markets will likewise soon boom. The details of who makes which crazy loans to whom will no doubt be different from what they were from 2002 to 2007, but the basic structure of incentives in the system is unchanged. The same people are running the American banks, and the same regulators are regulating them, so you can easily get the same outcome here as we have just seen.We should prohibit companies and senior managers in regulated financial industries from making donations to political campaigns. We should also restrict public employees involved in regulatory policy from working in those industries for five years after they leave office. And we should prohibit people who move to government from the finance sector from making policy decisions on bailout and regulatory-related matters for a minimum of five years.Our regulators need to be smart people who understand finance, but they don’t need to be drawn from the upper echelons of the financial industry. There are many proven, dedicated professionals in our regulatory agencies today, and we should support the development of an even stronger cadre of career regulators. It should be up to the financial sector to make its practices clear and simple enough for these professionals to understand, and any that are too complex should not be approved.Finally, we should significantly raise capital requirements for the financial sector — and the bigger the bank, the more capital you should need. (Of course, this would discourage banks from growing too large.) The Obama administration should at least triple the current requirements.Our financial system provides valuable services to the public, but it also poses serious risks. If we can’t re-regulate more strongly to better protect public funds, the next crisis could be worse than the last one.'"

"'09-09-20,'0','HERE is a first, for me anyway: a restaurant owner whose day job is training dogs.No jokes, please. If you think about it, working with pets requires an instinct for human behavior; as Cesar Millan, the famed Dog Whisperer, puts it: “I rehabilitate dogs. I train people.”So perhaps it wasn’t such a stretch for Joshua Cederbaum — the buoyant 30-year-old owner of Doggy Tales, a company that works with animal shelters to rehabilitate lost or abandoned dogs — to open Market in downtown Montclair in May, in the midst of the worst economic downturn in memory. And in hindsight, it’s clear he knew just what it would take to captivate this food-obsessed town:A staff as outgoing as he is, one that observes his dress code — miscellaneous T-shirts and shorts or jeans — and imparts a “We try harder” ethic that feels genuine and winning.A sweetly nostalgic early-20th-century railroad-car diner (the former Greek Delights) with just 45 seats, 18 of them at a counter trimmed with a hand-painted nursery rhyme: “To market, to market to buy a fat pig ... .”And most important, a menu (top price: $19) that lives up to the restaurant’s name — abundant with fresh produce from local markets, mainly organic and grown or raised on farms within a day’s drive of Montclair.“Sustainable and seasonal” is the culinary mantra du jour, of course, and such claims should be viewed with narrowed eyes, even at a restaurant whose countertops hold wooden crates overflowing with fat, gorgeous eggplants and ears of corn in the bright green peak of health.'"
"'09-09-20,'0','IT could be said — with a bit of imagination — that mortgage-backed securities, a prime trigger of last year’s financial meltdown, are to this age what strains of the bubonic plague or thermonuclear explosions were to others: something widely feared, if not entirely understood. Who, beyond Wall Street, even knows what one looks like? Here is one, issued by Bank of America in 2006, at the height of the mortgage-backed security craze.For decades, a homebuyer seeking a mortgage would, generally, get a loan from a local bank, to which the buyer would repay the money with interest. Securitization means lenders sell such loans to investors, to shift risk away from themselves and to raise more money to make more loans.To create this mortgage-backed security, the lender, Bank of America, transferred $478,411,100 worth of mortgages to the Banc of America Funding 2006-B Trust, a shell company, or special purpose vehicle, created to insulate the bank from default. Banc of America 2006-B Trust then sold the securitized mortgages to investors, like mutual funds, with the help of a broker, the Bank of America Securities LLC. Yet another corporate cousin, the Bank of America, National Association, is the servicer of this security, meaning it received monthly mortgage payments from real people in real houses and passed the money on to investors.THE FIRST MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITY was created by the Government National Mortgage Association, or Ginnie Mae, in February 1970. Demand rose steadily over the next three decades, reaching a high in 2003, when $3 trillion worth of mortgage-backed securities were issued in a single year. Of the $12 trillion in mortgages outstanding in the United States, slightly more than half have been turned into securities, said Tom Deutsch, deputy executive director of the American Securitization Forum. With the credit crisis, the market in bank-issued, or “private label,” mortgage-backed securities — as opposed to those backed by government entities like Ginnie Mae — has decreased to almost nothing. “It’s a staggering magnitude of difference from 2006 to 2009,” Mr. Deutsch said.UNTIL A FEW YEARS AGO, prospectuses for most mortgage-backed securities — the one pictured runs to 272 pages — were printed as bound books, costing thousands of dollars, and hours. But it became easier to issue electronic PDF versions under a 2005 overhaul of the Securities Act of 1933. Prospectuses used to be “these big old clumsy paper documents,” Mr. Deutsch recalled. “Junior associates or paralegals would literally have to go down to the printer and make sure every number was correct.”THE STANDARD MINIMUM to invest in a mortgage-backed security is $25,000. Generally speaking, 25 to 50 separate investors might buy in, each with varying tastes for risk. A state pension fund, for example, is most likely not as loose with its money as, say, a hedge fund. So mortgage-backed securities are cut into pieces, known as tranches, each carrying a different level of risk and reward. This security has been cut into six riskier pieces called subordinate certificates and 14 less-risky pieces called senior certificates. The risk is determined by factors like the borrowers’ income and net assets and the amount of equity they keep in their homes — essentially, how likely they are to default on their mortgages.'"
"'09-09-20,'0','“When I found New Canaan, I just couldn’t believe the uniqueness of this place,” said Jack Trifero, 58, who moved here in the mid 1970s. The red-brick storefronts along Main and Elm Streets “reminded me a bit of ,” he said. “It was definitely a community.”Mr. Trifero said he had also been delighted to discover a cache of nearly 100 midcentury modern houses built in the ’50s by architects like Marcel Breuer and , who at one point kept his office in the Building, at 88 Main.By the ’60s, the town was known as a pioneer of the four-acre single-family property zone, slapped on top of a two-acre zone. Big lots — McProperties, you could call them — enabled old money and avant-garde to coexist. It’s hard to throw rocks at glass houses, after all, when they can’t be seen from the road.New Canaan was also known as a haven for book editors and writers, advertising executives and transient corporate families (“I’m with : I’ve Been Moved”). “Next station to heaven,” it was called, but with an edge. Along with good schools and abundant tennis courts, there were more than a dozen stores. ’s 1997 film captured the ennui of the town’s teenagers circa 1973.More recently the culture gave way to financial-sector families. In 2007, the population was about 19,400, the median household income $178,650, and the median home sale price $1.685 million.While there are fewer liquor stores, not everyone is unwinding with . “Any type of drug available in any community is present in New Canaan,” Leon Krolikowski, the police captain, said, “with alcohol still being the most commonly abused substance.”McMansions notwithstanding, New Canaan remains “very quaint,” said Robert Wyatt, 55, who moved here with his family two and a half years ago and lives within earshot of the commuter train’s hourly bleats as it lumbers in. “Everybody knows you, and the schools are excellent,” he said. Indicating a church youth group that does volunteer work, he said, “Of course, it’s a very wealthy community, but families really give to that effort and participate.”Residents also help to sustain the Waveny Care Network, which has an assisted-living residence and a care center for patients, with its own evocative indoor version of Elm Street. There’s also Staying Put in New Canaan, a membership group that helps elderly residents live on their own, and Silver Hill Hospital, a and addiction treatment center known for its rich and famous patients.Children are expected to conform and perform. “It’s a nice place to live,” said Dawson Allen, 18, a recent high school graduate. But “one downside is the focus on scores and academics. When you step outside that box, it gets iffy.”In this suburb, registered Republicans outnumber Democrats 3,242 to 1,322; 93 percent of residents are white, according to a 2007 survey by the Connecticut Economic Resource Center. Stay-at-home spouses with children in tow are so common they help keep Rosie’s, a cafe and carry-out on Elm, in business. “They don’t work; they work out,” George Nammack, an owner, said fondly.The 22-square-mile town has concentric circles of one-third-, one-half-, one- and two-acre lots, capped by a swath of homes on four acres or more. About 1,200 apartments and condominiums mingle with roughly 6,000 single-family homes. Standing out from the conventional crowd downtown is a brand-new ultracontemporary house at 173 Street, which recently went on the market for $4.95 million.Boutiques and chain stores line downtown streets east of the Victorian train station. Town planners are contemplating a zoning change that would invite larger businesses and medical practices to move into an area southwest of the station. Opponents of the change, including Mr. Trifero, who owns a video store on Main Street, maintain that it would dilute the village atmosphere and hurt shops like his. “It’s a delicate biosphere,” he said.There are about 265 houses on the market this fall, with asking prices starting at $350,000. Although overall prices are down “at least 20 percent” since 2006, says Jaime Sneddon, a broker at William Raveis Real Estate, and although a third of the sales he handled in the first six months of 2009 went for less than $1 million, the average is still $1.6 million.Agents are listing about 70 condos, priced at $300,000 to $2.3 million. Ms. Parris, who works for William Pitt International, noted that the sluggish market had made more houses and condos available for rent, with nearly 100 listed at prices ranging up to $25,000 a month. The complex, about a mile from the train station, has one- to three-bedroom apartments, starting at $2,199 a month. Units in the Ferrara Building downtown rent for $1,950.The rush-hour train to takes 65 minutes; at other times, the trip takes an additional 5 to 10 minutes and requires changing in Stamford. Some commuters drive; the town is just off the Merritt Parkway.WHAT TO DOThe rich assortment of public spaces includes “God’s Acre,” a patch of green rimmed by graceful old homes and churches; Waveny Park, a 300-acre former estate with vast fields and a new swimming pool; Mead Park, with a pond and playing fields downtown; and the Nature Center, with 40 acres of well-tended paths and buildings on Oenoke Ridge. The town runs a youth center, a senior center, a well-endowed public library and a human services department with a staff of six.There’s also the private Silvermine Guild Arts Center, which offers classes and workshops.Day trippers are drawn by the town’s pastoral back roads, antiques and clothing shops, lush parks and sophisticated restaurants. Mr. Trifero offers informal driving tours of the Modernist housing stock (modernhouseman.com). Tours of the Philip Johnson Glass House require reservations ( ). Overnighters with means book at the Roger Sherman Inn and restaurant, opposite the Nature Center and about a 15-minute walk to New Canaan’s downtown ( ).“In the last 15 years or so,” Mr. Walker, the first selectman, said, “the No. 1 attraction for people who have come to this town would be the school system. We have probably the best school system in the state of Connecticut, certainly one of the best in the entire New York metropolitan region.”There are five public schools. Among fourth-graders in 2008, 88.3 percent showed proficiency in reading, 89.6 percent in writing and 88.7 percent in math, versus 55.9, 62.9 and 60.3 percent statewide.The high school led the state on the SAT’s last year. Averages were 599 for math, 581 for reading and 593 for writing, versus 504, 502 and 503 statewide.Established as Canaan Parish in 1731, the town switched from farming to manufacturing and became known in the early 19th century for its shoemakers. It was incorporated in 1801; 67 years later trains arrived, changing everything.'"
"'09-09-20,'0','Ms. Smith’s article has made the already tenuous tenure of artists in academia even more tenuous. Her call for artists to go forth without credentials is naïve at best and seems to assume that graduate programs fail to teach artists survival skills or encourage them to develop emotionally vivid works.I concur with Ms. Smith that the Ph.D. in art is a bad idea in the United States, where an M.F.A. entails 60 hours of graduate credit. No one says an education is cheap.To imply, however, that this is money ill spent is to endanger the job of every artist with a university appointment. That Ms. Smith thinks a band of renegade conceptual artists will do a better job of teaching young artists than university professors do is insulting. It’s also like yelling “fire” in a crowded theater, as it comes at a time when many colleges are already cutting art faculty.The writer is the associate chairman of the interdisciplinary arts department of Columbia College in Chicago.'"
"'09-09-20,'0','William Trevor’s 14th novel begins about 50 years ago with a funeral in the Irish country town he calls Rathmoye. The deceased is Mrs. Eileen Connulty, a prosperous widow who ran a local lodging house for traveling salesmen, Number 4 The Square, and who, as death came near, “feared she would now be obliged to join her husband and prayed she would not have to.” The emotional realignments Mrs. Connulty’s two middle-aged children will undergo as a result of her passing are in the normal order of things; her funeral’s true importance, however, will lie not in its grim grinding of life’s usual gears but in the way it fatefully joins two bystanders.A young amateur photographer named Florian Kilderry, who has bicycled seven and a half miles into Rathmoye to take some pictures, finds himself blocked by the funeral procession and in need of directions. They are provided by a shy young farmer’s wife, Ellie Dillahan, who will later recall “noticing the hands that operated the camera. Delicate hands, she’d said to herself.” Raised as a foundling by the nuns at Cloonhill convent, Ellie had eventually been placed as a housekeeper with Mr. Dillahan, the owner of a snug, successful farm, an entirely decent man haunted by the accident that took the lives of his wife and infant child. After a few years he married Ellie, and they have now settled into a peaceable, dull routine.Ellie is “content but for her childlessness,” or so she believes, but after a second encounter with Florian she is unable to banish the photographer from her mind. For a moment she considers taking her thoughts to the confessional, since, for all their blamelessness, they seem to have consecrated the simple objects she and Florian were surrounded by when they met in the local grocery store: “She wondered if they would ever be the same again, if what she’d bought herself would be, the Brown & Polson’s cornflour, Rinso. She wondered if she would be the same herself.”If not so transfigured as Ellie, Florian is infatuated with her gentle innocence. “The sole relic of an Italian mother and an Anglo-Irish father,” a gaily artistic pair who lived mostly on love and charm, Florian has inherited neither their talents — he knows he has no real gifts as a photographer — nor their romantic luck. Ellie will never extinguish the torch he’s been carrying for an Italian cousin, Isabella, ever since the summer visits she made to Ireland when they were both adolescents.Possessed of a curious but convincing combination of fecklessness and strong will, Florian sits inside Shelhanagh, his parents’ decaying country house, wondering what to do. After deciding to sell the place and go abroad, he makes a bonfire of his father’s diaries and his mother’s postcards. But he delays revealing his intentions to Ellie during their chaste meetings at the gate-lodge of what was once a fine estate. “Perhaps Scandinavia,” he finally says, in answer to her question about where he’ll go.Though he does have a “fondness for concealment,” Florian is not so much caddish as emotionally lazy. He seeks “to prolong a friendship which summer had almost made an idyll of. . . . He had loved being loved, and knew too late that tenderness in return was not enough.” And so the idyll continues, drawing Ellie toward the brink: “She had meat to get in Hearn’s, and a few groceries in the Cash and Carry. Then she looked up Scandinavia in Hogan’s, where she had once bought a new exercise-book for the accounts. School books were kept too, and she found Scandinavia in an atlas.”'"
"'09-09-20,'0','The build-up of dollars abroad was also the catalyst for a remarkable transformation in the flow of money around the world. The United States found itself literally operating as a gigantic bank, taking short-term liquid deposits from countries with surpluses and investing the money in long-term, risky assets at home and abroad. The numbers involved were staggering. In 1996, the United States had international assets and liabilities of around $5 trillion. By 2007 the figure was more than $20 trillion. Like any bank, it was vulnerable to a run. The main fear was that the United States at some point would be faced with a modern-day replay of Triffin’s dilemma and would have to deal with the consequences of a collapse in confidence in the dollar.Instead, what led to the current mess was a somewhat different strain of the same disease. As Wolf traces out so well in his 2008 book “Fixing Global Finance,” the United States was able to absorb all the goods coming out of Asia only by letting its consumers go progressively deeper into debt — a process that had its own limits. Moreover, the flood of money simply overwhelmed the capacity of financial institutions to handle it. A lot, for example, ended up in the most unregulated segments of the global banking system, like off-shore deposits on the books of non-American banks. These banks, now awash with cash and desperate for places to put the money, became easy marks for American investment banks seeking to peddle securitized mortgages. When a large percentage of these loans went bad, instead of a dollar panic we had a global banking crisis.Past economic cataclysms have led to dramatic changes in international financial arrangements. The Great Depression knocked the world off the gold standard. The economic turmoil of the late 1960s and early ’70s led to the collapse of Bretton Woods. Will the current crisis bring similar changes?So far we have avoided a repeat of the Great Depression. Countries have collectively pursued the right macroeconomic policies — protecting and recapitalizing their banking systems, cutting interest rates to the bone and letting budget deficits expand. There are no signs as yet of the sort of protectionism that gave us the 1930 Smoot-Hawley tariff. The biggest worry, however, is that in the recent economic downturn the two groups of countries worst hit were those most exposed to the forces of globalization — the export-driven economies of Asia and countries, notably those of Eastern Europe, most heavily dependent on foreign capital.One scenario has the world adjusting smoothly to the new realities. American consumers, tapped out by debt, tighten their belts. The Asian economies reconsider the wisdom of relying so heavily on exports to drive their growth and focus more on domestic consumption. And with less money to recycle, international banks, which had done such a poor job, are cut down to size.But two dangers could make the current bad situation worse. One is that China finds it too difficult or politically costly to restructure its economy and, despite the changes in the global market, keeps its foot on the export accelerator. Since the American consumer cannot afford to keep buying, this would set off a cycle of trade wars among Asian countries competing for ever smaller markets.The second is yet another version of Triffin’s dilemma: if even a small fraction of foreign holders of dollars were to be spooked by our budgetary problems, we could have a spike in the cost of capital just when the economy is trying to recover. The risk of such a situation is clearly on the minds of Chinese policy makers. Zhou Xiaochuan, the governor of the People’s Bank of China, explicitly referred to Triffin’s dilemma in a speech this March on the need for reform of the international monetary system.Like our current crisis, the Great Depression was brought about by a malfunction of the international financial system. The nations of the world lost confidence in the system’s ability to reconcile their ­conflicting interests and ambitions. The result, as Harold James documents in “The End of Globalization: Lessons From the Great Depression,” was a disastrous backlash against globalization. The economies of the world hunkered down behind high tariff barriers, import controls and restrictions on capital flows.Even a liberal like John Maynard Keynes, once a committed proponent of free trade, lost faith in open markets. In 1933, in the depths of the Depression, he wrote, “I sympathize, therefore, with those who would minimize, rather than with those who would maximize, economic entanglement among nations. Ideas, knowledge, science, hospitality, travel — these are the things which should of their nature be international. But let goods be homespun whenever it is reasonably and conveniently possible, and, above all, let finance be primarily national.”Until we can reconcile the export ambitions of the Asian countries, particularly China, with the import capabilities of the rest of the world, and make the volume and value of reserves less dependent on the vagaries of macroeconomic policy in one country, the risk of a similar loss of faith in today’s international financial system remains.'"
"'09-09-20,'0','FROM the ice-cold waters of the Strait of Georgia, the 150-mile-long waterway that separates Vancouver Island from mainland British Columbia , the eastern shore of Galiano Island looked untouched by man — if not by nature. The sandstone shore was curled and carved by centuries of storms and waves, and beyond it rose the spruce, fir and russet-trunk arbutus trees that cover much of this skinny, 19-mile-long island. South of where I swam was a sheltered cove, Pebble Beach, protected from the wind, its namesake pebbles warmed by the unclouded sun. Under the water lay thick-bodied ocher starfish, and on its surface floated the bulbous heads of bull kelp.The only sign I saw, one afternoon in early August, that human beings lived on Galiano were the not-so-bulbous heads and not-so-thick bodies of Heather, Noah and Miss Mae, the 20-something strangers I’d met five minutes before, who themselves were floating in the water in a prehistoric state: They were naked.Pebble Beach was, as Noah put it, “the nudie beach,” and I, following the lead of these locals, was naked, too, hovering in the warm water near the surface and hoping not to freeze.Skinny-dipping with strangers might seem a little weird, even a bit louche, for a first-day tourist experience, but on Galiano, it took on a surprising innocence — an atmosphere that persisted as the trio, along with their friend, Tia, who’d stayed clothed on the shore, brought me to Noah’s home for beers and homemade blackberry-blueberry pie.Then, as the light was beginning to fade and the shadows’ chill settled on us, we followed a path through the woods that led to Retreat Cove, a secluded inlet where a single sailboat bobbed in waters flecked gold by the sun. We drank, enjoying the day’s last rays, and then I left them alone, hiking to the main road and heading for my bed-and-breakfast.Two questions popped into my mind as I walked along the unfamiliar road, my thumb outstretched: Where was I? And more important, when was I? The first answer was obvious: I was in the Gulf Islands, an archipelago that stretches up the Vancouver Island coast. Connected by the mostly reliable and affordable BC Ferries, they are easy escapes from the bustle of the mainland (from Vancouver, Galiano was a 55-minute ride that cost 14.85 Canadian dollars, or $13.50 at 1.10 Canadian dollars to the U.S. dollar). All are prized by in-the-know Canadians for their rustic beauty, bountiful farms and friendliness to typically cash-poor artists and craftsmen. But even among these frugal islands, Galiano stands out, which leads me to the second answer.The year 2009 may be drawing to a close, but on Galiano a low-budget trip takes on the open-ended feeling of summer 1979. Skinny-dipping aside, this is a place out of time. Cars are mostly unnecessary: everyone from farmhands to restaurant workers gets around by thumb. (And “everyone” is itself a stretch: Only 1,100 people live here year-round.) Shiny blackberries hang from dense roadside bushes, unmanned stands sell paper bags of “transparent apples” (great for applesauce), and fat oysters sit in shallow waters, turning every trip to the beach, up a small mountain or down the street, into a foraging expedition from hunter-gatherer days.There’s certainly money here — a passenger in the car that picked me up that night was building a Tibetan-style house on the island’s northern end— but riches feel superfluous when one of the finest meals to be had on the island costs a mere 31.50 dollars a person.That meal, in fact, was what had lured me away from my new friends, who had invited me for roast duck. Instead, I returned to La Bérengerie, a restaurant and bed-and-breakfast run by Huguette Benger, who visited Galiano from her home in Avignon, France, in 1980 and fell in love with the trees and the sea.“Like most people on Galiano,” she said, “you come for a weekend and you stay for your life.”In 1982, Ms. Benger opened La Bérengerie, moving it the next year to a wood-frame house she’d built herself, and in its intimate dining room, lighted by lamps that recall both Tiffany and India, began serving her style of French food, influenced by her Provençal upbringing, local ingredients and foods she’d tasted on her travels. The night I ate there, the four-course prix-fixe meal bore traces of Russia (neon borscht), the Balkans (cucumber-yogurt salad), southern France (tapenade-crusted snapper) and, of course, Galiano (a cake studded with local berries). That’s a lot of geography — not to mention a lot of food —for the price.La Bérengerie’s rooms offered the same value-added appeal: brass beds and steamer trunks, aged wainscoting and delicate floral wallpaper, carved wood mirrors and vintage leather club chairs, and tons of space for 95 dollars a night (including breakfast). So what if the bathroom was shared? With only three bedrooms, it was unlikely there would be a line.'"
"'09-09-20,'0','“It’s clear they have fought wars right next to each other. You get this feeling they were in the first gulf war, the second, and Afghanistan. They probably killed and did awful things together. I think they have an intimacy that’s profound.”Rather than draw on the occasional bumps in the road in the friendship, Mr. Hoffman said, his performance instead taps into his affection for Mr. Ortiz.“When Iago says of Othello, ‘I hate the Moor,’ a line that Iago repeats, that was very interesting to me,” Mr. Hoffman said. “Why does he keep saying ‘I hate the Moor’? Shakespeare is a lot more colorful about expressing Iago’s feelings about other people. There’s something in those four words — love and hate are just rubbing right up against each other. So I started seeing Iago less as a Machiavellian character and more as somebody who was acting out in the moment, who was making this up as he goes along.”Mr. Sellars said that while Iago’s villainy is as clear as ever in the Public’s production, he and Mr. Hoffman wanted to go beyond one-dimensional characterizations of Iago as a cackling devil and Othello as one of literature’s most clueless dupes.“Iago’s famous line ‘I am not what I am’ is ‘Yes, I’m doing this, but even I don’t believe it,’ ” Mr. Sellars said. “It makes him burn in hell. Shakespeare’s whole point is that heaven is something made between two people, and so is hell. You watch Othello and Desdemona create heaven but then lose it. And Iago creates his own hell because of Othello and because Iago is smart. It’s smart people who do the most damage to the world, who make the worst decisions in government.”In this regard, Mr. Sellars said, he was particularly inspired by members of the Bush administration, though the production also explicitly reflects the current White House. This production is set in present-day Washington, with the all-powerful Duke — who promotes Othello over Iago early in the play — as an Obama-like figure.Gaius Charles (the high school football phenom Smash on NBC’s “Friday Night Lights”) plays the Duke in a business suit, shuttling between a situation room and a press room as his troops, led by Othello, undertake a mission in a war-torn Middle Eastern country. (Shakespeare sets that military conflict in Cyprus; Mr. Sellars has retained those references to locations, which include Venice, which the production presents as a financial capital not unlike New York City.)“It’s no accident that the youngest person in the cast is playing the Duke-president, and he’s black,” Mr. Ortiz said. “And he appoints a Latino general to handle the crisis overseas. The power shift under way in the United States right now is something that any American production of ‘Othello’ has to grapple with in the era of Obama.”Mr. Sellars said he also wanted to reflect the changing ethnic makeup of America in his casting, not least in choosing Mr. Ortiz, a Latino actor, to play a black character. (Nonblack actors have memorably played Othello before, like Raul Julia in the Public’s production in 1991.)“In the 21st century in this country you can no longer look at Othello as a black guy, as some symbolic figure of the unrepresented black person,” Mr. Sellars said. “He is a person, period. In our cast we have three black actors, three Latin actors and two white actors. We’re mixing it up, just like America is mixing it up.”Mr. Sellars, a veteran director of Shakespeare (he once staged “Antony and Cleopatra” in a Harvard University swimming pool), began envisioning the production in the midst of the presidential campaign, after a provocative lunch he had with the Nobel Prize-winning author Toni Morrison.“I hated this play all my life — I love Shakespeare, and I hated this play — and I mentioned that to Toni, and she spent the next five hours telling me how wrong I was and quoting the play from memory,” Mr. Sellars said. “I initially thought that the only way you could explain Othello as a character is that he wasn’t smart. How would he fall for Iago’s ruse? But Toni took me into another level of the language and what’s at stake.”In an interview Ms. Morrison recalled that she urged Mr. Sellars to shrug off memorable productions, like the one with Laurence Olivier in blackface, and look closely at the text to wrestle with the Iago-Othello relationship and to reconsider the motives of the men.“The performances and the makeup and the race baggage of past ‘Othello’ productions have at times gotten in the way of people connecting to the play,” Ms. Morrison said. “One of the reasons I think casting John and Phil was a brilliant choice was that they bring their own personal relationship to the play, and they have a rich understanding of the ups and downs of friendship.”It was Mr. Sellars who brought Mr. Hoffman and Mr. Ortiz together for the first time, in 1994, casting them in another updating of Shakespeare, a “Merchant of Venice” set in a Southern California beach town. Since then they have acted together or collaborated on other productions, mostly through LAByrinth. (Mr. Ortiz helped form Latino Actors Base in the early 1990s, which evolved into LAByrinth.)“Running LAB with Phil was a wonderful experience, but that act of stepping aside just helps feed the bigger picture of the company moving on, getting new energy,” Mr. Ortiz said. “It’s always been a dream of mine that the company would be around long after I’m not around. It’s healthy.”While this production is unusually brief because of the actors’ other commitments, Mr. Sellars plans to continue performances in other cities with as many of the current cast members as possible over the next five years and ultimately to film the production with Mr. Hoffman and Mr. Ortiz. Ms. Morrison said she plans to write a play, tentatively titled “Desdemona,” a reconception of “Othello” through the eyes of the title character’s wife, that would ultimately be performed and filmed alongside this production.“We want to get those two films into every high school in America,” Mr. Sellars said. “We all need to get beyond the bad racial image of this play and move it to a new place, and these are the actors to do it. And I want to give John and Phil the chance to inhabit these roles across a lifetime, like Olivier and Richardson and Gielgud. And since Phil and John have the kind of friendship they do, I know that they’ll stick together for ‘Othello’ for years to come.”'"

But that progress has largely bypassed people like James Johnson, an impoverished and arthritic 74-year-old who has been sleeping on a thin cushion in a trailer, searching for help to rebuild his shattered home.Mr. Johnson finally got some good news recently when a group associated with the Presbyterian Church committed to build him a new home. But the years of worry and discomfort have taken a heavy physical and emotional toll on this fiercely independent man.This is not what Congress envisioned when it approved an initial $5.5 billion in disaster relief for Mississippi. It was disaster aid. The law required states and localities to spend 50 percent of the money on low- and moderate-income families. Over time, however, the state managed to get waivers and found other ways to spend the money on different projects.In Mr. Johnson’s case, the problem was too narrow a definition of disaster relief. According to a startling new report by the Steps Coalition, a watchdog group, Mr. Johnson and thousands of other homeowners were shut out of the state’s assistance program because their homes were destroyed by wind rather than water.While many Mississippians languished without help, the Bush administration’s allowed the state to shift $600 million of the recovery money to the refurbishment and expansion of the Port of Gulfport — a pet project of local politicians that was conceived long before Katrina.'"

"'09-09-21,'0','Consider a stock that picks up 10 cents on even days of the month and loses that much on odd days. Now imagine, instead, a stock that picks up value until the midpoint of the month, and then sinks until the endpoint. Both stocks offer the same monthly and yearly return. But investors will tend to regard the first stock as safer than the second, according to a paper soon to be published in The Journal of Consumer Research. The researchers found an essentially irrational buyer response to “run length,” meaning the height and depth of a stock’s spikes, unrelated to the frequency with which the stock varies, the period of time over which the investment is contemplated, the stock’s returns over a given period or its average value.The paper’s authors suggest that this tendency springs from the way people process visual information, giving undue weight to especially visible points, like the tips and bottoms of a graphed line with long runs. Priya Raghubir, a professor of marketing at New York University’s business school and one of the paper’s authors, said her results were especially important because of the increasing use of user-friendly online graphing tools for stocks. “It’s become much easier to access this information now,” she said.

"'09-09-21,'0','LOS ANGELES  Walt Disney’s proposed $4 billion acquisition of Marvel Entertainment may come with a headache: newly filed claims challenging Marvel’s long-term rights to some of its superhero characters.Heirs to the comic book artist Jack Kirby, a creator of characters and stories behind Marvel mainstays like “X-Men” and “Fantastic Four,” last week sent 45 notices of copyright termination to Marvel and Disney, as well as Paramount Pictures, Sony Pictures, 20th Century Fox, Universal Pictures, and other companies that have been using the characters.The notices expressed an intent to regain copyrights to some of Mr. Kirby’s creations as early as 2014, according to a statement disclosed on Sunday by Toberoff & Associates, a law firm in Los Angeles that helped win a court ruling last year returning a share of the copyright in Superman to heirs of one of the character’s creators, Jerome Siegel.Reached by telephone on Sunday, Marc Toberoff, the firm’s founding partner, declined to elaborate on his firm’s statement. A spokeswoman for Marvel had no comment.Disney said in a statement, “the notices involved are an attempt to terminate rights 7 to 10 years from now, and involve claims that were fully considered in the acquisition.” Fox, Sony, Paramount and Universal had no comment.Marvel’s management agreed to sell the company to Disney last month, though the deal still requires the approval of Marvel’s shareholders.Even before the Kirby family sent its notices, Disney was facing criticism from some Wall Street analysts who expressed concern that Marvel’s complex web of copyright agreements might prevent Disney from capitalizing on some Marvel assets.Sony has the film rights to Spider-Man in perpetuity, for instance, while Fox has the rights to X-Men and Fantastic Four. Paramount has a distribution agreement for a few movies that Marvel is producing on its own, including a second “Iron Man” film.Hasbro has rights to produce certain toys, and Universal holds Florida theme park rights to Spider-Man and the Incredible Hulk, among other characters.Mr. Kirby, who died in 1994, worked with the writer and editor Stan Lee to create many of the characters that in the last decade have become especially valuable to Hollywood. Mr. Kirby was involved with the Incredible Hulk, the Mighty Thor, Iron Man and the Avengers, among other characters that have been adapted for the screen since his death.The window for serving notice of termination on the oldest of the properties opened several years ago, and will remain open for some time under copyright law. But Disney’s pending purchase of Marvel has given anyone with possible Marvel claims more reason to pose a challenge.Under copyright law, the author or his heirs can begin a process to regain copyrights for a period of time after the original grant. If Mr. Kirby’s four children were to gain the copyright to a character Mr. Kirby helped create, they might become entitled to a share of profits from films or other properties using it.They might also find themselves able to sell rights to certain characters without consent from Marvel, Disney or the various studios that have licensed the Marvel properties for their hit films.In July, a federal judge in Los Angeles ruled that Warner Brothers and its DC Comics unit had not violated rights of the Siegel heirs in handling internal transactions related to Superman. But an earlier ruling had granted the heirs a return of their share in the copyright.Copyright matters have become increasingly tangled for Hollywood, as it continues to trade on characters and stories that were created decades ago but are now subject to deadlines and expiration dates under federal copyright law.'"
"'09-09-21,'0','Duplicate players compete in far more pair events than team tournaments. And this can sometimes adversely affect their play in a team competition.In pairs, overtricks are very important. Everyone plays the same deals, and your score is compared with the other pairs who held your cards. Suppose you are sitting North-South and are playing in three no-trump. If you make it exactly for plus 600 and every other North-South declarer wins 10 tricks for plus 630, you get zero match points (a bottom). Conversely, of course, if you win 10 tricks when everyone else takes 9, you get a top.At teams, though, if you make 600 and your opponent 630, you lose only one international match point. But if, trying for an overtrick, you turn a sure 600 into minus 100, you lose 12 imps. Why try for 1 imp and risk losing 12?But even experienced players can make that mistake. The diagramed deal was Board 75 of the Bermuda Bowl semifinal between China Long Zhu and U.S.A.-2 in São Paulo, Brazil, this month. At both tables South was in three no-trump, West led his fourth-highest heart, and declarer won with dummy’s queen and ran the spade jack.When Jeff Meckstroth was the declarer, West won with his spade king and cashed the heart ace. Meckstroth took his nine top tricks: two spades, two hearts and five diamonds. Note that Meckstroth could have won 10 tricks by playing a club to his king, but he was not going to risk his contract by assuming East had the club ace.In the other room, where Yang Lixin was South, Nick Nickell (West) defended better, smoothly ducking at the second trick. Now declarer should have cashed the diamond queen (to check that the suit was not 5-0), then played a heart to guarantee nine tricks, but he got greedy, taking a second spade finesse. Nickell won that trick and returned a spade. Suddenly declarer had only eight winners. He played a heart, but West won with his ace and shifted to a club. Ralph Katz (East) took his ace and cashed two spade tricks for down one.'"

"'09-09-22,'1','The question at the heart of one of the biggest cases this year is simple: What constitutional rights should corporations have? To us, as well as many legal scholars, former justices and, indeed, drafters of the Constitution, the answer is that their rights should be quite limited — far less than those of people.This Supreme Court, the court, seems to be having trouble with that. It has been on a campaign to increase corporations’ legal rights — based on the conviction of some conservative justices that businesses are, at least legally, not much different than people.Now the court is considering what should be a fairly narrow campaign finance case, involving whether Citizens United, a nonprofit corporation, had the right to air a slashing movie about during the Democratic primary season. There is a real danger that the case will expand corporations’ rights in ways that would undermine the election system.The legal doctrine underlying this debate is known as “corporate personhood.”The courts have long treated corporations as persons in limited ways for some legal purposes. They may own property and have limited rights to free speech. They can sue and be sued. They have the right to enter into contracts and advertise their products. But corporations cannot and should not be allowed to vote, run for office or bear arms. Since 1907, Congress has banned them from contributing to federal political campaigns — a ban the Supreme Court has repeatedly upheld.In an exchange this month with Chief Justice Roberts, the solicitor general, , argued against expanding that narrowly defined personhood. “Few of us are only our economic interests,” she said. “We have beliefs. We have convictions.” Corporations, “engage the political process in an entirely different way, and this is what makes them so much more damaging,” she said.'"
"'09-09-22,'1','A two-judge panel of a federal appeals court has ruled that big power companies can be sued by states and land trusts for emitting carbon dioxide. The decision, issued Monday, overturns a 2005 District Court decision that the question was political, not judicial.A panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, in New York, ruled that eight states — California, Connecticut, Iowa, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island, Vermont and Wisconsin — as well as New York City and three land trusts could proceed with a suit against American Electric Power, Southern Corporation, the Tennessee Valley Authority, Xcel Energy and Cinergy Corporation, all large coal-burning utilities.The case, brought in 2004, said the defendants were creating a “public nuisance” and sought reductions in emissions that scientists say are changing the climate. The states cited studies from the United Nations and the National Academy of Sciences that predicted damage and said in fact that their environments had already been damaged. The land trusts said that an increase in sea level would inundate their properties, among other problems.The power companies said that the federal courts had never recognized an argument in common law that greenhouse gas emissions contribute to global warming, and that if action were to be taken, Congress would have to do it.The lower court agreed that the issues demonstrated the “transcendently legislative nature of this litigation,” and that if they found in favor of the states and the land trusts, the courts would have to figure out how to cap emissions, set reduction goals and a schedule for achieving them, and take other steps that would seem to require legislation.'"
"'09-09-22,'1','Even the near-miss losers in the Netflix million-dollar-prize competition seemed to have few regrets.Netflix, the movie rental company, announced on Monday that a seven-man team was the winner of its closely watched three-year contest to improve its Web site’s movie recommendation system. That was expected, but the surprise was in the nail-biter finish.The losing team, as it turned out, precisely matched the performance of the winner, but submitted its entry 20 minutes later, just before the final deadline expired.Under contest rules, in the event of a tie, the first team past the post was the winner. “That 20 minutes was worth a million dollars,” Reed Hastings, chief executive of Netflix, said at a news conference in New York.Yet the scientists and engineers on the second-place team, and the employers who gave many of them the time and freedom to compete in the contest, were hardly despairing.Arnab Gupta, chief executive of Opera Solutions, a consulting company that specializes in data analytics, based in New York, took a small group of his leading researchers off other work for two years. “We’ve already had a $10 million payoff internally from what we’ve learned,” Mr. Gupta said.Working on the contest helped the researchers come up with improved statistical analysis and predictive modeling techniques that his firm has used with clients in fields like marketing, retailing and finance, he said. “So for us, the $1 million prize was secondary, almost trivial.”Indeed, since it began in October 2006, the Netflix contest was significant less for the prize money than as a test case for new ideas about how to efficiently foster innovation in the Internet era  notably, offering prizes as an incentive and encouraging online collaboration to tap minds worldwide.The lessons of the Netflix contest could extend well beyond improving movie picks. The researchers from around the world were grappling with a huge data set  100 million movie ratings  and the challenges of large-scale modeling, which can be applied across the fields of science, commerce and politics.The prize model is increasingly being tried on work like new science and freelance projects in design and advertising. The X Prize Foundation, for example, is offering multimillion-dollar prizes for path-breaking advances in genomics, alternative energy cars and private space exploration.InnoCentive is a marketplace for business projects, where companies post challenges  often in areas like product development or applied science  and workers or teams compete for cash payments or prizes offered by the companies. A start-up, Genius Rocket, runs a similar online marketplace mainly for marketing, advertising and design projects.“The great advantage of the prize model is that it moves work away from the realm of the beauty contest to being performance-oriented,” said Michael Schrage, research fellow at the Center for Digital Business at the Sloan School of Management at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. “It’s the results produced that matters.”The emerging prize economy, according to some labor market analysts, does carry the danger of being a further shift in the balance of power toward the buyers  corporations  and away from most workers.Thousands of teams from more than 100 nations competed in the Netflix prize contest. And it was a good deal for Netflix. “You look at the cumulative hours and you’re getting Ph.D.’s for a dollar an hour,” Mr. Hastings said in an interview.Netflix, Mr. Hastings said, did not do a crisp cost-benefit analysis of its investment in the contest. But several crucial techniques garnered from the contest have been folded into the company’s in-house movie recommendation software, Cinematch, and customer retention rates have improved slightly. Better recommendations, Netflix says, enhance customer satisfaction.“We strongly believe this has been a big winner for Netflix,” Mr. Hastings said.The prize winner was a team of statisticians, machine-learning experts and computer engineers from the United States, Austria, Canada and Israel, calling itself BellKor’s Pragmatic Chaos. The group was actually a merger of teams that came together late in the contest.In late June, the team finally surpassed the threshold to qualify for the prize by doing at least 10 percent better than Cinematch in accurately predicting the movies customers would like, as measured against actual ratings. Under the contest rules, that set off a 30-day period in which other teams could try to beat them.'"
"'09-09-22,'1','The technology is certain to devour a substantial amount of the plant’s energy output — optimists say 15 percent, and skeptics, 30 percent. Some energy experts argue that it could prove even more expensive than solar or nuclear power.And as with any new technology, even the engineers are unsure how well it will work: will all of the carbon dioxide stay put?Environmentalists who oppose coal mining and coal energy of any kind worry that sequestration could simply trade one problem, global warming, for another one, the pollution of water supplies. Should the carbon dioxide mix with water underground and form carbonic acid, they say, it could leach poisonous materials from rock deep underground that could then seep out.Given the depths to which workers have drilled, they also fret that the project could cause earthquakes, although experts at the Environmental Protection Agency discount the risk of catastrophe.More broadly, some environmentalists argue that the carbon storage effort could give corporations and consumers another excuse to drag their heels in supplanting coal dependence with an embrace of renewable energy sources like the sun and wind.“Coal is the drug of choice of a major industry with a lot of political power,” said David H. Holtz, executive director of Progress Michigan, an environmental group.Instead of adopting carbon capture, which Mr. Holtz likens to a methadone cure for addiction, he argues that the industry would do better to go cold turkey.“There’s no evidence that burying carbon dioxide in the earth is a better strategy than aggressively pursuing other alternatives that clearly are better for the environment and will in the long run be less costly,” Mr. Holtz said.But power company officials say the effort is the energy industry’s best hope of stanching carbon dioxide emissions over the next few decades.“I really believe, in my heart of hearts, that coal is going to be burned around the world for years to come,” said Michael Morris, chairman and president of American Electric Power, which owns the plant here. “Retrofitting is going to be essential.”is the nation’s largest electricity producer, with a coal-fired grid stretching across 11 states.If all goes smoothly, this week engineers will begin pumping carbon dioxide, converted to a fluid, into a layer of sandstone 7,800 feet below the rolling countryside here and then into a layer of dolomite 400 feet below that.The liquid will squeeze into tiny pores in the rock, displacing the salty water there, and assume a shape something like a squashed football, 30 to 40 feet high and hundreds of yards long.American Electric Power’s plan is to inject about 100,000 tons annually for two to five years, about 1.5 percent of Mountaineer’s yearly emissions of carbon dioxide. Should Congress pass a law controlling carbon dioxide emissions and the new technology proves economically feasible, the company says, it could then move to capture as much as 90 percent of the gas.For now the project consists of the two wells and a small chemical factory. In the factory, smoke diverted from the plant’s chimney is mixed with a chilled ammonia-based chemical. The chemical is then heated, releasing the carbon dioxide, which is pumped deep into the wells.American Electric Power is spending $73 million on the capture and storage effort, which includes half the cost of the factory. Alstom, the manufacturer of the new equipment, paid for the other half of the factory, hoping to develop expertise that will win it a worldwide market. Alstom would not say what it spent, but public figures indicate that the two companies are jointly spending well over $100 million.For energy planners, a crucial question is how much this technology would cost if refined and installed on a bigger scale. The answer remains elusive.Still, many scientists emphasize that Mountaineer is within a dozen miles of four other big coal plants with a combined capacity of 6,000 megawatts, a concentration so great that industry insiders have nicknamed the area Megawatt Alley. If the technology spread to all of them in a cost-effective way, many say, it could have a broad impact on the coal industry.S. Julio Friedmann, leader of the carbon management program at the in , calls this corner of the Ohio River Valley a “must win” region for carbon dioxide storage.Robert Socolow, a engineering professor, echoed that sentiment. The nation’s fleet of coal-burning plants “completely dominates our national emissions,” Professor Socolow said.It is also far easier to corral several million tons flowing from a single chimney than a comparable amount coming from tens of millions of car tailpipes or home heating systems, experts point out.Far larger projects for capturing and storing carbon dioxide underground have been under way for several years in and North Africa. In , the Great Plains Synfuels plant, which converts coal to methane, takes the leftover carbon dioxide and pumps it through a pipeline to to stimulate oil production there. But Mountaineer is the world’s first electricity plant to capture and store carbon dioxide.A state permit issued to American Electric Power limits the pressure it can use to inject carbon dioxide into the rock. This is to reduce the risk that the injection will crack rock layers above that engineers are counting on to keep the carbon dioxide in place.A nonprofit research group, Battelle Memorial Institute, has installed monitoring wells around the rock that will measure changes in pressure and temperature. Engineers can also send energy pulses through the earth between the wells and measure how fast these travel, as a guide to how the carbon dioxide is spreading.Asked whether the injections of carbon dioxide could increase the frequency or magnitude of the small earthquakes that are common in the area, an official said it seemed unlikely.“With proper site selection and good management, we should be able to implement this safely,” said Dina Kruger, director of the agency’s climate change division. Ms. Kruger also emphasized that the carbon dioxide would be monitored to see if it was seeping.“It doesn’t matter to me if a scientist says it may or may not leak,” said Elisa Young, an anti-coal activist who lives nearby on the side of the river. “That’s not going to stop it from leaking when push comes to shove.”At the same time, many others in this coal-dependent region suggest that the notion that carbon dioxide is a menace has been overplayed.Charles A. Powell, the manager of the Mountaineer plant, who has worked there since it opened three decades ago, pointed out that the gas is given off by every human and animal.'"
"'09-09-22,'1','But Scott Kessler, an assistant district attorney, said he would introduce a hospital physician who would testify that Ms. Giraldo told her: “It wasn’t an accident. We were fighting, and he cut my face.”The stakes are high politically as well as personally, with the Democratic senator’s seat forfeit if he is convicted of a felony and the Senate now split 32-to-30 Democratic. Mr. Monserrate is one of two Democrats who briefly defected to the Republicans this summer, throwing Albany into gridlock.The emotionally charged case is being heard by Justice William M. Erlbaum — rather than a 12-member jury — at Mr. Monserrate’s choice. At the heart of the case are videos recorded by cameras in Mr. Monserrate’s building, on 83rd Street, that the prosecution says show the couple arguing bitterly before he attacked her.Justice Erlbaum, in discussing the case months ago with lawyers, said the videos caused “the blood to boil” — a phrase Mr. Tacopina touched on in his opening, saying he would challenge the videos “frame by frame, minute by minute, pixel by pixel.”The judge took pains Monday to explain that his comment “was a statement made early in litigation” amid concern over the video’s effect on prospective jurors and that now that he is the sole fact finder as well as jurist, he had not prejudged the evidence. “You have my assurance I will play by the rules,” he said.While the positions of the parties have been well known for months, the opening statements and first witnesses added some dramatic details.Mr. Kessler said that he would call hospital workers who had treated Ms. Giraldo and that they would testify that she had initially incriminated Mr. Monserrate.The prosecutor said one witness would be a nurse, Susan Cabibbo, at Long Island Jewish Medical Center on the Queens-Nassau County line, where Mr. Monserrate drove a bleeding Ms. Giraldo, bypassing closer hospitals. He quoted Ms. Giraldo as having told Ms. Cabibbo, “He’s crazy, he’s crazy,” referring to Mr. Monserrate.Dr. Dawne Kort will testify that Ms. Giraldo told her: “I can’t believe he did this to me. My face! My face!” Mr. Kessler said.He said Dr. Kort would also testify that Ms. Giraldo told her: “We were fighting. I asked for a glass of water.”Mr. Monserrate, he said, then responded: “You want the water? You want the water? Here’s the water.” Whereupon, the prosecutor said, the glass broke in Mr. Monserrate’s hand and he swiped at Ms. Giraldo with a sharp piece, inflicting one cut horizontally over her left eye and a deeper vertical cut, wounds that took 20 stitches to close.Mr. Tacopina said Mr. Monserrate was actually being solicitous, not snide, when he brought Ms. Giraldo water. He said her statements at the hospital were misconstrued by workers who did not understand her Spanish.Mr. Kessler said the argument began when Mr. Monserrate found a Patrolmen’s Benevolent Association card with another man’s phone number on it in Ms. Giraldo’s purse and threw it down the trash chute in their building. The card was later retrieved by police officers and presented as the state’s Exhibit No. 1.'"
"'09-09-22,'1','On the first day of his civil trial in the so-called Clearstream affair, former Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin on Monday accused President Nicolas Sarkozy of pursuing him for political reasons. Mr. de Villepin, left, is accused of involvement in a smear campaign against Mr. Sarkozy and 38 other plaintiffs dating back to 2004, when Mr. de Villepin and Mr. Sarkozy were ministers in President Jacques Chirac’s government and jockeying to succeed him. The case centers on a leaked list, since determined to be fake, of people including Mr. Sarkozy said to hold secret bank accounts at Clearstream, a financial clearinghouse in Luxembourg. The accounts were supposedly linked to kickbacks related to the sale of French frigates to Taiwan. “I am here because of the determination of one man, Nicolas Sarkozy,” Mr. de Villepin said before taking his place on the defendants’ bench. “I will leave free and vindicated.”'"
"'09-09-22,'1','President Obama continued his media blitz on Monday, as he sat down with the “Late Show” host David Letterman.Mr. Obama started out by trading quips with Mr. Letterman about his daughters’ future dating prospects (the boyfriends may get stressed out by the men with guns who hang around) and what happens to the parents of schoolchildren who have Malia and Sasha over for sleepovers (they get frisked).But the conversation quickly turned serious, with a discussion of how the president would reach a decision about sending more troops to Afghanistan (by “asking some very hard questions”) and whether he thought racism was behind protests against his health care proposals (he said he did not).The broader reason for Mr. Obama’s trip to Manhattan is the annual multiday gridlockfest that is the opening days of the United Nations General Assembly. Mr. Obama is scheduled to talk about global hot topics like climate change, development, poverty, the economy, the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, and the efforts to rein in Iran’s nuclear ambitions.But his first stop was at the Ed Sullivan Theater on Broadway to tape his first appearance on the Letterman show since being elected. (Mr. Obama appeared on the show as a candidate, and was on Jay Leno’s old show in the spring).A woman from Missouri brought a heart-shaped potato to the show’s taping, and Mr. Letterman did a Top 10 list of reasons Mr. Obama agreed to do the show (No. 6: “Someone offers you 600 bucks, you take it, ladies and gentlemen”). Mr. Obama’s own explanation: “The main reason I’m here? I want to see that heart-shaped potato.”'"
"'09-09-22,'1','“There’s a great spot for a brand like ours, particularly in a recessionlike environment,” John Krafcik, the chief executive of Hyundai Motor America, said. “Consumers are beginning to question the value of a premium brand — is it worth an extra $5,000?”Hyundai’s Exhibit A is the Genesis, a luxury sedan that was named North American car of the year at the Detroit auto show in January. Part of the appeal of the Genesis, in addition to a price tag that is thousands less than that of its chief rivals, may be that hardly anyone associates Hyundai with the word “luxury.”Its lowest-priced model, the Accent, sells for just under $10,000 for the base package. The Genesis, its most expensive model, starts at $32,250 — by comparison, the Lexus ES 350 costs $34,470, and the Cadillac CTS costs $36,560.Several dealers have said that they are selling the Genesis to business owners who, after laying off some employees, want to project an image that they, too, are cutting back.“The current economic climate really places an emphasis on people spending their money wisely,” said George Glassman, a Hyundai and Kia dealer in suburban Detroit who sold Oldsmobiles until G.M. eliminated that brand in 2004.“They’re appealing to people’s desires to spend reasonably and to get great value for your dollar,” Mr. Glassman said. “Twenty years ago, Hyundai was a reasonable alternative to purchasing a used car. Now they are attracting consumers from all ages and all walks of life.”Mr. Glassman’s recent customers include Joe Randazzo, who had considered the Chevrolet Malibu sedan because his son works for G.M. Despite the family connection and his past preference for Cadillacs, Mr. Randazzo chose to buy a Hyundai Sonata.“It’s a very good ride, and I really enjoy driving it,” said Mr. Randazzo, 79, who is retired from running a ceramic tile business. “I used to drive Cadillacs all the time. I don’t need to drive a heavy car like that anymore. No disrespect to G.M. or anybody, but my next car will be a Hyundai, too.”Hyundai’s research indicates that 30 percent of consumers now consider the brand when shopping for a new vehicle, nearly triple the number who did about five years ago.“They went from the perception of cheap to an excellent value,” said Mr. Merkle, the analyst. “I think that this will stick even after we come out of this environment, because people are becoming better acquainted with the product.”Aggressive marketing is another reason Hyundai’s sales are surging. The automaker introduced a first-of-its-kind offer early this year that lets customers who find themselves without work return their car with no penalty for up to a year. It later expanded the offer to include up to three months of payment relief.G.M. and Ford briefly offered similar programs after the Hyundai program helped increase sales.Hyundai also jumped ahead of competitors this summer, by inviting customers to turn in old, inefficient vehicles under the cash-for-clunkers program three weeks before its official start.“They’re really trying to use this recession as an opportunity to take market share, which they have,” Jessica Caldwell, director of industry analysis at Edmunds.com.Hyundai and Kia are pushing for more. In November, Kia plans to open a new assembly plant in West Point, Ga., its first in the United States. (Hyundai has a plant in Alabama.)Several new models are coming soon, including the compact Kia Forte this fall and revamped versions of the Hyundai Sonata and Tucson next year.The company’s goal is to have the industry’s highest fuel economy by 2015; it is currently third, behind Toyota and Honda, even with no hybrid in its lineup.“We may do that a couple of years earlier if you look at the trajectory we’re in,” said Mr. Krafcik.'"
"'09-09-22,'1','A smaller share of Americans married, drove to work alone, owned their own home or moved to a new residence last year than the year before.More lived in overcrowded housing. Property values declined. And fewer immigrants arrived, which meant that for the first time since the beginning of the decade, the total number of foreign-born people in the country did not grow.Those were among the findings released Monday in the Census Bureau’s annual American Community Survey, a wealth of data comparing the nation’s profile in 2008 with that of 2007.Several experts, including Mark Mather, associate vice president for domestic programs at the Population Reference Bureau, said a number of the changes could be attributed to the national recession, which began at the end of 2007. The result is an early statistical snapshot of the economic downturn and the housing bust.For example, after rising steadily since 2000, median home values dropped in 2008, and the homeownership rate fell half a point, to 66.6 percent, the lowest since 2002. Among blacks, who have been disproportionately affected by foreclosures, homeownership fell a full point, to 45.6 percent.Furthermore, in a country where people typically move to take advantage of better job opportunities, those who changed residences fell to 15 percent in 2008, from a recent peak of 16 percent in 2006.“Job loss, or the potential for job loss, leads to feelings of economic insecurity,” Dr. Mather said, with implications for additional matters like the timing of divorce and marriage. Such insecurity appears to have added to a longer trend in which the share of people over age 15 who have never married increased to 31 percent last year from 27 percent in 2000.The latest figures appear likely to fuel political debates on subjects as varied as health care (the rate of uninsured children last year ranged as high as 20 percent, in Nevada) and immigration (fewer newcomers appear to be illegal or unnaturalized immigrants).Earlier private and government surveys suggested that immigration was slowing, but these were the first annual census figures showing it to be stagnant.“We’ve had an economic downturn, and that may well be affecting the attractiveness of the United States as a destination,” said Thomas A. Gryn, a statistician with the bureau’s immigration statistics staff.William H. Frey, a demographer at the Brookings Institution, said: “The general economic malaise in the U.S. has drawn fewer immigrants from Mexico and elsewhere. At the same time, there are increases in high-skilled immigrants from India” and some other Asian countries.The statistics also showed that real median household income declined nationwide, rising in only five states  New York, New Jersey, Kansas, Louisiana and Texas  compared with 33 states in 2007. It ranged from $37,790 in Mississippi to $70,545 in Maryland. Income inequality was highest in metropolitan New York, where the top fifth of households received 20 times as much as the bottom fifth.The median price of an owner-occupied home fell nationally (by 2 percent, to $197,600) and in 22 states. The biggest declines were in Nevada and California (16 percent) and Florida (9 percent). Increases in value were recorded in Texas, Utah, Wyoming, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Tennessee and North Carolina.The highest housing costs for homeowners with mortgages were in California, New Jersey, Hawaii, Connecticut and Massachusetts. While those costs nationally were about the same as the year before, the drop in median income meant that more owners with a mortgage (29 percent) and renters (41 percent) were paying 35 percent or more of their income for housing.The proportion of people lacking health insurance ranged from 4 percent in Massachusetts to 24 percent in Texas.Overcrowding, defined as more than 1.51 people per room, afflicted 1.1 percent of households, up from 0.7 percent.And the proportion of workers who commuted by driving without anyone else decreased slightly, to 75.5 percent from 76.1 percent, and ranged from 54 percent in New York to 83 percent in Alabama. Those who carpooled and those who used public transportation increased a bit.'"
"'09-09-22,'1','And the strange thing is how similar the arcs of their stories are: they recount how after a long period of suffering, prejudice and hatred, a group has carved a distinctive place in the history of the United States, its once scorned identity now a source of strength. Many of these museums also serve as anchors for the community and as educational centers, recounting political morality tales and honoring a shared history. That is certainly the case here as well.Ms. Lin designed the institution’s main exhibition space to surround a bare-bricked, sky-lighted central area between the two connected buildings that constitute the museum. The central atrium, with a staircase leading down to a floor of offices and classrooms, invokes both a traditional Chinese courtyard and a rough-edged shared urban habitat that recalls yards or alleys over which neighbors shared stories, sometimes leaning out of windows.The main gallery rooms even have windows looking out over the bricked space, only here each window also functions as a screen on which videos and photographs are projected as autobiographical histories are recounted. The galleries (with exhibition design by Matter Architectural Practice and mgmt. design) are intimate and make it seem as if you were passing through the rooms of a modest home. They lead chronologically from the 19th-century history of China’s encounters with the West to lives of contemporary Chinese-Americans told on a wall of video screens.This core exhibition, “With a Single Step: Stories in the Making of America,” was created by the historian John Kuo Wei Tchen, a co-founder of the museum, along with Cynthia Ai-fen Lee. It depends less on artifacts like the cap gun or the display of irons used by once-familiar Chinese laundry establishments than on the arc of the narrative.One side of some galleries tells of struggle and hardship, showing images of the riots that led to the 1882 Chinese Exclusion Act, for example, in which unskilled Chinese immigrants were barred. Also on display are the crib sheets an aspiring immigrant once studied to convince officials at Angel Island (the San Francisco counterpart to Ellis Island) that he was more than a “paper son” whose false documents affirmed a connection to someone already in America.The most fascinating galleries are compressed displays of how the image of Chinese-Americans was shaped into stereotypes in early 20th-century culture, ranging from Fu Manchu’s villainy to chop suey’s homogenized exoticism. The position of Chinese-Americans became still more complicated when China was an ally during World War II, a Communist enemy in the 1950s and a warily watched trading partner and political rival in the 1980s and ’90s.The other side of the main galleries contains illuminated panels with brief biographies of individuals who transcended all these obstacles. There is Dr. Faith Sai So Leong (born 1880), for example, who became the first female Chinese dentist in America; Du Lee (born 1879), who organized the Chinese American Citizens Alliance in 1915 “to combat anti-Chinese sentiments”; and Yan Phou Lee (born 1861), who became the first Chinese student elected to Phi Beta Kappa and gave the commencement address when he graduated from Yale in 1887. And, of course, more contemporary Chinese-Americans are here as well, including Secretary of Energy Steven Chu, the architect I. M. Pei and the cellist Yo-Yo Ma.But despite the museum’s considerable achievement it also harbors a tension that reveals some of the problems with the identity archetype. Like some other identity museums celebrating ethnic groups and communities, this one can too easily slip into the “we,” making it seem as if it were an internal account rather than a public statement. Each gallery includes a poem by Mr. Tchen and a narrative highlighting identity issues.“Years of floods and droughts push our sons and fathers to leave ancient homes,” we are told of the 19th-century emigrations. “We find work and opportunity, but we also find many enslaved and dispossessed,” we read. “Writers like Jack London call us ‘heathens’ and say we can never become real Americans,” another display says.And as a kind of haunting theme there is the question: “So are ‘we’ to be included in their sacred ‘We the People’? Or not?”This approach tends to accent the hardened formula of the identity narrative (and overshadows the museum’s ability to explore more fully the nature of Chinese culture and immigration). Typically, in this account, triumph is reserved for the very end, with the 1960s as a turning point: the civil-rights movement is hailed for weakening the hold of prejudice and loosening the fetters of xenophobia. It is as if identity itself becomes the source of salvation. It may have begun as the instigation for oppression but it ends as a force for liberation. One gallery here contains posters and publications from that era that emphasizes these themes.There is no question that the ’60s political movements had an effect on the status of all minorities; the identity narrative itself was shaped in that era. But aspects of this exhibition, particularly autobiographical statements that can be read, listened to or watched, reveal that model’s limits.While the actual texts of some of these accounts are constructed from historical information by contemporary Chinese-American writers, including David Henry Hwang, Maxine Hong Kingston, Gish Jen and Ha Jin, the nuances they introduce are important. A 19th-century laborer, Ah Quin, speaks of working in Alaska as a cook for miners, sending home $30 every few months. Another 19th-century figure, Wong Chin Foo, makes it clear just how old certain political movements are: “When the Chinese Exclusion Act was renewed in 1892 with even more restrictions on the Chinese here, I helped form ‘The Chinese Equal Rights League.’ Through our efforts, we managed to persuade some congressmen to consider our proposals to grant us the rights guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution.”And later in the exhibition there are brief written accounts by more recent immigrants, like Sam Wong, whose wandering first took him to Vietnam and Cambodia before “the U.S. welcomed me.”In these voices, and others, we can hear the mixture of prospects and obstacles that Chinese immigrants encountered. This must have been true even in the worst of times: Chinese laborers sought to come here even after it was clear that nothing like paradise was in store. Many must have recognized degrees of restriction and opportunity and risked their lives to minimize one and maximize the other.This is an aspect of the history that was once emphasized in older stories of American immigration, demonstrating how opportunities trumped hardships and possibility triumphed over prejudice. There is no point in returning to that model’s glossy idealism, which too easily elided over injustices and failings.But the first-person stories here suggest that the dominant identity model has its own form of exaggeration, heightening trauma and minimizing promise. The hope is that over time this will be amended (and not just in this museum) with a fuller understanding of both sides of a hyphenated identity.'"
"'09-09-22,'1','THE FACTS As cold season approaches, many Americans stock up on their vitamin C and echinacea. But heeding the age-old advice about catching up on sleep might be more important.Studies have demonstrated that poor sleep and susceptibility to colds go hand in hand, and scientists think it could be a reflection of the role sleep plays in maintaining the body’s defenses.In a recent study for The Archives of Internal Medicine, scientists followed 153 men and women for two weeks, keeping track of their quality and duration of sleep. Then, during a five-day period, they quarantined the subjects and exposed them to cold viruses. Those who slept an average of fewer than seven hours a night, it turned out, were three times as likely to get sick as those who averaged at least eight hours.Sleep and immunity, it seems, are tightly linked. Studies have found that mammals that require the most sleep also produce greater levels of disease-fighting white blood cells — but not red blood cells, even though both are produced in bone marrow and stem from the same precursor. And researchers at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology have shown that species that sleep more have greater resistance against pathogens.“Species that have evolved longer sleep durations,” the Planck scientists wrote, “appear to be able to increase investment in their immune systems and be better protected.”THE BOTTOM LINE Research suggests that poor sleep can increase susceptibility to colds.'"
"'09-09-22,'1','The stock market peeled back some of its recent gains on Monday as investors cashed in profits and unwound their recent bets on the dollar, gold and oil.Financial shares fell the most of 10 major market groups, and energy producers and companies that make industrial products like plastics and chemicals fell, reflecting some investors’ concerns that an ebullient rally had vaulted some corners of the stock market too high, too fast. Markets across Europe and Asia also tilted lower.A new report on forward-looking economic signals underscored concerns about overly optimistic expectations in the stock market, even as it signaled that the recession was ending.The Conference Board’s index of leading indicators improved for another month, bolstered by high supplier deliveries, improvements in credit markets and increases in building permits — all signals of an economy on the mend. But the index’s gain of 0.6 percent in August was lower than gains in the previous two months, and it disappointed forecasters, who had been expecting an increase of 0.7 percent.Now that a number of economists, along with Ben S. Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, have said the recession is probably over, investors are focusing on the shape of the recovery. Some expect a quick rebound as industries rebuild their supplies while others say that the economy may struggle for years.'"

"'09-09-23,'0','Under the 14-page policy, residents who already owned dogs on the outlawed list could keep them if they were registered by May 1, but many tenants failed to do so and were forced, like Mr. Hernandez, to choose between keeping their dogs or their apartments.Since April, the owners of at least 113 dogs have given them up, citing the ban, to shelters and centers run by Animal Care and Control of New York City, the nonprofit group that has a contract with the city to take in unwanted animals.Of the 113 dogs, 49 have been euthanized, because of illness, behavior or a lack of space. Fifty-nine were adopted by individuals or taken by rescue groups, two remain in shelters and three were reclaimed by their owners.The statistics were supplied by the Mayor’s Alliance for NYC’s Animals, a coalition of animal rescue groups and shelters that examined shelter intake records.The Mayor’s Alliance, which is not affiliated with the mayor’s office, and the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals have asked the to stop enforcing the ban. The groups found that many of the dogs turned in were described as well behaved by shelter workers.“You can’t predict what a dog is going to be like just simply based on its breed,” said Jane Hoffman, president of the Mayor’s Alliance. “I don’t want a dangerous dog out there. But doing it this way is wrong and it’s condemning perfectly innocent dogs to death.”City Councilwoman Rosie Mendez of , the chairwoman of the Council’s Subcommittee on Public Housing, has also called for a re-examination of the policy. She said one resident with a 28-pound poodle told her that she planned not to feed the dog until it was under the 25-pound limit.A spokesman for the Housing Authority, Howard Marder, said the new rules were a response to complaints and reports of dangerous and threatening dogs from tenants, tenant leaders and the police. The three breeds on the forbidden list had been identified as “the most frequent problem breeds,” Mr. Marder said.There have been several attacks by pit bulls in public housing buildings in recent years. A 12-year-old girl was mauled by two pit bulls in in 1997, and there have been more than 17 dog attacks since 2007 in which people were hurt or other pets were killed or maimed.Mr. Marder said that the Housing Authority had discussed the issue with animal welfare groups, but that he was not aware of any plans to ease the restrictions. “We made these changes based on the realities of what we hear from residents living in public housing, about how difficult their lives are because of being threatened or attacked by these animals,” he said.Victor A. Gonzalez, 60, tenant association president at Rabbi Stephen Wise Towers on the Upper West Side, said he knew of about 16 pit bulls there. “The elderly are fearful,” he said. “They’re afraid to get on the elevators with these dogs, much less be in the lobby when they get in.”As of July 31, there were 4,792 dogs registered with the authority. So far, no one has been evicted for having an unauthorized dog, but the authority has pursued 41 termination-of-tenancy cases against residents for violating the pet policy. Nine cases have been resolved, Mr. Marder said: Some were withdrawn at the housing manager’s request and one tenant gave a dog to a friend. The 32 others are pending.The agency announced the rules by publishing a notice in the April issue of its monthly newspaper. But that notice listed 27 prohibited breeds, including the Shar-Pei, the cane corso and the dogo Argentino. Mr. Marder said the agency had tried to identify breeds that exceed 25 pounds when grown, but realized that the long list was “impractical” and cut it to three.Tenants have received verbal and written warnings about their dogs from housing managers. An employee instruction guide on using the agency’s computerized program of pet tracking is 37 pages long, and maintenance workers who go into apartments to make repairs make a note of any pets in the household, Mr. Marder said.Mr. Hernandez, who lives with his mother at Mariana Bracetti Plaza in the East Village, took Tyson into the management office the day before the ban started, but Tyson could not be registered because he also exceeded the previous weight limit, infrequently enforced, of 40 pounds.Mr. Hernandez said he feared that he and his mother would be evicted if he kept Tyson. “I got scared, so of course I’m going to do it,” he said. Mr. Hernandez later learned that Tyson had been adopted.Kanielle Hernandez, 23, who lives in the same building as Mr. Hernandez but is not related to him, refused to give up Denim, her 60-pound blue-nosed pit bull, after he was refused registration because of his weight.She said she walked Denim when housing managers were not around, as if harboring a fugitive. “I’m still cautious,” she said. “I get scared if I see a manager.”'"
"'09-09-23,'0','A United Nations program that has raised $1.2 billion over the past three years for the treatment of H.I.V./AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis through a small fee added to airline tickets sold in 15 countries is going global.Starting in January, travelers in the United States and other countries buying airline tickets through some of the world’s largest booking companies — including Travelocity, Orbitz and other companies owned or served by Sabre, Travelport and Amadeus — will have the option of adding $2 to their cost to support the fund-raising efforts of Unitaid, which fights life-threatening diseases in poor countries.Philippe Douste-Blazy, chairman of the organization and the under secretary general at the United Nations charged with developing new financing mechanisms for development projects, said he expected the extended program to add hundreds of millions of dollars to Unitaid’s coffers each year.In 2006, when Mr. Douste-Blazy was the French foreign minister, he and Jacques Chirac, who was then the French president, and President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva of Brazil conceived the idea of taxing airline tickets and subsequently persuaded 16 countries to participate — one has not yet had a chance to contribute. He said the tax currently applies to 7 percent to 10 percent of airline tickets sold and accounts for three-quarters of Unitaid’s financing. “This new program will be the first global voluntary citizen contribution system, and it comes at a very important time,” Mr. Douste-Blazy said.He noted that government support for development aid is decreasing because of the economic crisis, which will make United Nations targets known as the Millennium Development Goals harder to achieve. The eight goals — which include reducing extreme poverty by half and providing universal primary education — were adopted in 2000 at a meeting of world leaders, but they are looking more and more elusive as the 2015 deadline approaches.'"
"'09-09-23,'0','“The e-reader has high awareness, but most people have still not seen or touched or played with them,” said Chris Homeister, senior vice president for entertainment at Best Buy. “We feel that this is a technology that is beginning to emerge and that we can bring a unique experience to the marketplace.”The biggest challenge for iRex, in particular, will be the unfamiliarity of its brand among American consumers. But in many respects, its black-and-gray device is similar to rivals like the Kindle DX, which has a 10-inch screen and costs $489, and the forthcoming Reader Daily Edition, with its 7-inch screen and $399 price tag, from Sony.The iRex has an 8.1-inch touch screen and links to buy digital books in Barnes & Noble’s e-bookstore and periodicals from NewspaperDirect, a service that offers more than 1,100 papers and presents them onscreen largely as they appear in print form.This year, iRex talked with Barnes & Noble about putting the bookseller’s brand, and not its own, on the new device. But they could not reach an agreement, said Kevin Hamilton, the chief executive of iRex’s North American division and president at Amerivon Retail Sales, a venture capital firm that led an $8 million investment in the company this year.William Lynch, president of Barnes & Noble’s online business, declined to say whether the bookseller was working on its own reading device, but said it “planned to market digital books in really big and interesting ways” to the 77 million customers who walk into its stores every year. The Barnes & Noble e-bookstore will also be available through a large-screen device from the start-up Plastic Logic, which is expected next year.IRex has taken a somewhat circuitous path to the consumer market. As a division within Philips, the Dutch electronics company, it was responsible for supplying the screen technology for the Sony Librie, one of the first devices to use so-called e-paper, which mimics the appearance of regular paper on a digital screen. As a separate company since 2004, it has developed large-screen devices for business professionals, doctors and pilots, mostly in Europe.Its new consumer product offers some techie features that rivals do not. It contains a 3G Gobi radio from Qualcomm, the wireless component manufacturer, which will allow iRex owners to buy books wirelessly when they travel abroad. By contrast, the wireless modem in the Kindle works only on Sprint’s network in the United States. As with the Kindle, the price of the iRex includes unlimited wireless access.The iRex can also handle the ePub file format, a widely accepted industry standard, which means that owners can buy books from other online bookstores that use ePub and transfer texts onto the iRex.IRex says it is on track to have a color version of the device by 2011, something that other vendors, which rely on technology from eInk, a subsidiary of Prime View International of Taiwan, say is years away.One challenge for the entire digital reading market is the price of these new devices. A recent report from Forrester Research suggests most consumers will buy a digital reading device only when they cost less than $100. One way this could ultimately happen is if wireless providers like Verizon subsidize the devices and sell them in their stores, as they do with the inexpensive laptops called netbooks.Verizon says it has no plans to do this, but analysts think that could conceivably change if e-readers like the iRex sell well. “If this becomes a revenue stream for a company like Verizon, which actually gets paid for the bandwidth required to distribute content, then it is in Verizon’s benefit to promote these devices and in many cases underwrite them,” said Allen Weiner, an analyst at Gartner.But Mr. Weiner also says that first, iRex, Amazon and the entire e-reading category have an even more significant problem: savvy consumers may hold off on buying devices to see whether Apple enters the market with a more general-purpose tablet computer.'"
"'09-09-23,'0','Like most large international conferences, the United Nations climate summit meeting in New York this week generated a hefty dose of greenhouse gas emissions.Hundreds of presidents, prime ministers and officials from across the globe this week took airplanes to the United Nations meeting, some accompanied by dozens of people. Limousines and motorcades ferried the dignitaries from airports to meetings to hotels and back, often getting stuck in Midtown Manhattan gridlock.But since the goal of this meeting was to reduce the global emissions that have been linked to global warming, the United Nations decided to try to do something about all the carbon dioxide produced by the delegates: it bought carbon offsets.Under a new and expanding program for offsetting emissions, United Nations administrators calculated that the meeting would generate the equivalent of 461 tons of carbon dioxide, with air travel being the single largest component. They offset those emissions by directing money to a power project in rural Andhra Pradesh, India, through which agricultural leftovers like rice husks and sunflower stalks are turned into electricity for the local grid.The offsets are intended to cancel out the carbon dioxide emissions created by airline travel or driving by financing green projects that will eliminate as much CO2 as the polluting activities create.'"
"'09-09-23,'0','“More and more we are going to focus on the ‘you’ side,” she said.The marketing campaign, which will include television, billboards, print and online components, has a number of related catchphrases all meant to emphasize the message, including “The Internet is under new management, yours,” and “The Internet has a new personality, yours.”The big marketing push follows years of turmoil at Yahoo, as the company lost market share to Google in search and online advertising, lost many of its top executives and suffered plummeting employee morale after endless reorganizations and multiple rounds of layoffs.Analysts say that Ms. Bartz has brought a dose of stability to the company. She has also shifted Yahoo’s mission to focus more intently on content, mobile services and personalization. Most notably, she struck a landmark deal to outsource some of its search operations to Microsoft.But Ms. Bartz said that outside the Internet and advertising industries, where Yahoo’s recent history was well known, the company’s image remained positive.“When you get out of New York City and Silicon Valley, everybody loves Yahoo,” Ms. Bartz said.The campaign, which will formally begin on Monday, will encompass the United States and nine other countries, including Canada, Britain, France, Brazil and India, and will have varied objectives in different countries.In the United States, it is aimed at increasing the time users spend on Yahoo and introducing them to new features, or what Ms. Bartz calls “brand revitalization” and “franchise protection.” In emerging markets like India and Brazil, it is intended to spur a “land grab” to acquire market share, she said. In Europe, it will be a combination of both.Some analysts who have been critical of Yahoo said they were encouraged that Yahoo appeared to be tackling its business with renewed intensity. “What is very noticeable is that they are doing any marketing or branding at all,” said Jeffrey Lindsay, an analyst with Sanford Bernstein & Company. “That is probably a very good thing.”The campaign was overseen by Elisa Steele, Yahoo’s new chief marketing officer, whom Ms. Bartz recruited six months ago from Network Appliance, a company that offers network storage. Yahoo said that it collaborated with Landor Associates on the strategy, and relied on Ogilvy & Mather Worldwide for the creative. Both are units of WPP.Additional creative work aimed at advertisers is being developed internally at Yahoo.“Consumers need a refreshed, revitalized look at Yahoo,” Ms. Steele said in an interview. She added that the promise of the campaign would be backed by product enhancements that would allow consumers to personalize their Yahoo experience further.In recent months, the company unveiled a new version of its home page that made it easier for users to incorporate services from around the Web, like their personal Twitter or Facebook feeds. And it has revamped its e-mail service to allow users to organize their in-boxes according to the importance of their contacts.For Ms. Bartz, it seemed like the campaign had another goal: differentiate Yahoo from Google.Ms. Bartz has long expressed frustration when investors or reporters note that Yahoo has underperformed Google. She insisted that the two were quite different, with Google still largely anchored in search and Yahoo running a far more diversified business that gets half of its revenue from search and half from display advertising.“They aren’t us and we aren’t them,” Ms. Bartz said.'"
"'09-09-23,'0','ConAgra Foods posted weaker quarterly sales on Tuesday, though its profit beat expectations. The news raised concerns about the strength of its brands as consumers buy more private-label goods, leading its shares lower.ConAgra, which sold units to focus more on brand-name consumer foods, said profit in its consumer foods unit rose 34 percent.But sales in that unit rose only 1 percent. Part of the decline was a result of an explosion at a Slim Jim plant in June, which killed three people and stopped production there for several weeks.ConAgra said that profit fell to $165.9 million, or 37 cents a share, in the first quarter ended Aug. 30 from $442.4 million, or 95 cents a share, a year earlier.Excluding one-time items, earnings were 38 cents a share, compared with 23 cents from continuing operations a year ago. Analysts had forecast 34 cents. Sales fell 3.3 percent to $2.96 billion, from $3.06 billion a year ago. Shares fell 33 cents, to $22.'"
"'09-09-23,'0','The Environmental Protection Agency said on Tuesday that it would require the nation’s biggest emitters of greenhouse gases to start tracking their emission levels on Jan. 1 and report them to the government.The E.P.A. said the reporting would cover roughly 85 percent of the greenhouse-gas emissions in the United States linked to global warming.The new rules would require 10,000 industrial sites and suppliers of petroleum products to submit the data beginning in 2011. Suppliers of fossil fuels will be asked to estimate how much carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases are emitted when the fuels are burned by businesses and consumers in buildings and cars, the agency said.The E.P.A. said it had no firm estimate on how many businesses had the training and systems in place to report on their emissions.But a large percentage of those covered by the new regulations are already required to report emissions under other programs sponsored by the agency, it said. The agency said it had also been reaching out to businesses and offering training in how the emissions can be measured.'"
"'09-09-23,'0','Mr. Gelb acknowledged that his director had taken liberties. “But the liberties he took were intelligent ones,” Mr. Gelb added. He said that the rest of the run was sold out and that the production would return next season. “It certainly is the ‘Tosca’ of the immediate future,” he said. “We’re proud of it.”Mr. Bondy’s vision is a spare one. The sets and costumes are stark. He applies violent and lewd touches. Tosca gashes the portrait of the Magdalene (with a breast bared) painted by her lover, Cavaradossi; Scarpia, the villain, clasps a statue of the Madonna in a sacrilegious embrace; and three lascivious women drape and fondle him in his study at the outset of Act II.Mr. Bondy said that his direction was rooted in the text. The tearing of the picture is a natural extension of Tosca’s jealous rants. Scarpia’s cry, “Tosca, you make me forget God!,” supports his Madonna hug. And Scarpia has clearly stated his fondness for the possession and disposal of women: hence the three female playthings at the opening of Act II, even though the libretto does not call for them.The director blamed a strain of hidebound traditionalism for the lusty boos.“The reaction was very, very violent because they have a ‘Tosca’ since 22 years or 30 years and they don’t want to see something different,” Mr. Bondy said. “To think one work exists, and it has a final interpretation, is a problem.”Mr. Bondy also fired back at Mr. Zeffirelli, who had said in an interview that reports about the new production had led him to view it as a betrayal of Puccini’s intent and had called Mr. Bondy a third-rate director.“I’m a third-rate director, and he is a second assistant of Visconti,” Mr. Bondy said, referring to Mr. Zeffirelli’s early collaborations with the director Luchino Visconti. “I learned to be a director. He didn’t invent Puccini. He’s only Zeffirelli. I’m only Luc Bondy — more, not.”Renaud Machart, chief critic of the French newspaper Le Monde, who attended the opening night and gave the production a favorable review, said that the booing resulted from ingrained expectations based on “fake traditions” of opera direction.“But that is typical of many audiences, including France and Europe,” Mr. Machart said in an interview. “Believe me, I see so many things which are outrageous and stupid and try to do the opposite of what’s in the libretto. This is not what Bondy’s doing.”'"
"'09-09-23,'0','In its first week on sale “The Lost Symbol,” Dan Brown’s follow-up to “The Da Vinci Code,” sold more than two million copies in hardcover, audio and electronic book editions in the United States, Britain and Canada, according to the publisher, Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group. The company, a unit of Random House, said in a news release that the number represented “the biggest one-week sale in Random House history for a single title.” Though the large number was sure to bolster the mood among beleaguered booksellers, it came nowhere near the record set by “Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows,” the seventh installment in J. K. Rowling’s boy-wizard series. That book sold 8.3 million copies in the United States alone within its first 24 hours on sale.'"
"'09-09-23,'0','But French officials have signaled in recent days that they do not expect agreement on specific caps. And European officials appear to agree with American policy makers that the most important goal is to clamp down on huge bonuses that reward short-term results without holding executives accountable for a company’s long-term stability.The third and most difficult area of discussion involves how to prevent the kind of huge global economic imbalances that many analysts believe were central to the bubble-and-bust cycles of the last several years.The biggest imbalance of the past decade has been the gap between the soaring indebtedness of the United States, with its consumer economy, and the mounting surpluses of China and other countries whose growth has relied on exports.Export-dependent countries plowed trillions in surplus profits back into the United States over the decade, supplying a flood of cheap money that kept interest rates low and aggravated the huge speculative bubble in American home prices.American officials said they had no expectation of establishing any enforcement mechanism over the policies of individual nations. But they said they hoped to persuade the Group of 20 to support more balanced growth strategies, and officials were discussing proposals calling for governments to monitor each other through a “peer review” process in collaboration with the International Monetary Fund.Mr. Geithner said the goal was not force countries into changing their policies but to get them to agree on what was in their long-term self-interest. “The central insight is to force people to look forward,” he said, “to look at the size of the imbalances and at the risks building up.”For the United States, that would mean increasing investment and savings while slowing the growth of consumption. For China and other Asian nations, that would mean relying less on exports for growth and doing more to stimulate consumer spending at home.Some outside experts were skeptical that any pledges made in Pittsburgh would amount to more than platitudes. Simon Johnson, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, noted that Group of 20 leaders were not even trying to set timelines for ending their emergency economic stimulus measures.Eswar S. Prasad, an international economist at Cornell University, said there was still “a chasm on macroeconomic issues.”“China continues to see the proposed framework as an underhanded ploy by the U.S. to shift attention from its massive fiscal deficit,” Mr. Prasad said.But analysts said many governments were shocked so badly by the current crisis that they were already re-evaluating their strategies out of pure self-interest. In the last year, Chinese leaders have carried out a huge domestic spending program that has been a leading contributor to global growth.Though American officials insist they are not trying to cut a deal with China, the United States is also pressing hard to give China and other fast-growing emerging countries a bigger share of voting power at the International Monetary Fund.China, India and emerging economies have been pushing for a bigger role for years, contending that their voting power in monetary fund decisions has lagged behind their influence in the global economy. American officials agree, but European governments would be the losers in any rearrangement of voting rights and they have been reluctant to go along.White House and Treasury officials, for their part, have not tried to push European and Asian leaders into highly specific commitments. Mr. Geithner has refused to propose any specific capital ratios for banks, for example, saying that leaders should simply agree to nail down such numbers by the end of 2010. In part, that is a nod to European banks, many of which have higher debt level ratios than American banks.'"
"'09-09-23,'0','BEIJING — China has stopped issuing travel documents to foreigners seeking to visit Tibet, according to local tour operators, another indicator of the government’s skittishness over the coming anniversary of the Communist victory in 1949.The ban on new permits, which took effect on Monday, will last at least three weeks, travel agents say.This is the third time foreign travel to Tibet has been halted since March 2008, when rioting killed at least 22 people in Lhasa, Tibet’s capital, and left part of its main business district in flames.Tour operators who arrange the paperwork said the new regulations were issued Sunday by the region’s tourism bureau without explanation. They said that foreigners already holding permits would be allowed to travel to Tibet, but with restrictions, including requirements that they travel only with guides and stay in government-approved hotels. Tour operators said they were told that the ban on new permits would remain until at least Oct. 8.Yong Hong, deputy sales manager at Xigaze China International Travel Service in Lhasa, said the new rules were unexpected and not particularly welcome. “It was a sudden thing, but this year is unusual,” he said, referring to the Oct. 1 National Day celebrations marking the founding of the People’s Republic.Tourism, which makes up nearly 20 percent of the region’s economy, was battered by the rioting last year but has more than recovered, officials say. Nearly 1.4 million tourists visited the Tibet Autonomous Region in August, a monthly record, according to figures cited by Xinhua, the state news agency.'"
"'09-09-23,'0','The N.C.A.A. announced Tuesday that Jim Isch, a senior vice president and the chief financial officer, would serve as its interim president, after the death of Myles Brand last week.In a telephone news conference, Isch said Brand left a clear agenda that he would pursue until a president was selected by the N.C.A.A.’s executive committee. Those priorities include continued work on academic reform, maintaining financial stability and focusing on the balance between academics and athletics.“We are extremely fortunate that Myles has left us in great shape,” Isch said.Michael Adams, the president of the University of Georgia and chairman of the executive committee, said Isch’s appointment was “not a housekeeping role.”He added, “We will continue to move forward on the multitude of goals that Myles had laid out for us.”Before arriving at the N.C.A.A. in 1998, Isch was the vice chancellor of finance and administration at Arkansas, and was the vice president for administration at Montana State. He earned an undergraduate degree and a Ph.D. from Kansas State and has an M.B.A. from Boston University.William E. Kirwan, a co-chairman of the Knight Commission on Intercollegiate Athletics, which supports academic reform, praised the selection of Isch. “He understands the issues and the priorities and I think he has everyone’s confidence,” he said.Isch’s accomplishments at the N.C.A.A. include the establishment of a database of financial indicators that university officials use to assess their athletics programs. Kirwan said Isch had to overcome skepticism from some university presidents who worried the information could fall into the wrong hands.'"
"'09-09-23,'0','The stock market’s rally goes on.After a day of losses, stocks rebounded on Tuesday as top officials of the Federal Reserve held a two-day meeting to discuss interest rates, inflation and the economy. With big banks and industrial companies taking the lead, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 51.01 points, or 0.5 percent, to close at 9,829.87. JPMorgan Chase and Caterpillar were the biggest gainers in the Dow’s index of 30 blue-chip stocks.The broader Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index rose 7 points, or 0.7 percent, to 1,071.66, while the Nasdaq composite index picked up 8.26 points, or 0.4 percent, to end at 2,146.30.Meanwhile, the value of the dollar slipped again against a half-dozen major world currencies, hitting its lowest level in a year against the euro, at $1.479.Investors who fled to the relative safety of the dollar during last year’s financial crisis are now streaming away from the currency for a variety of reasons, pushing its value lower. Some are seeking higher returns in other currencies and different investments. Others worry that emergency financial interventions by the government and the Fed have laid the groundwork for higher inflation in the future.Despite worries that foreign governments — China above all others — are losing their appetite for American debt and dollars just as the United States is racking up huge new deficits, analysts said that overseas dollar holdings remained strong. This June, 36.4 percent of China’s reserves were Treasuries, up from 29.6 percent last year, said Marc Chandler, global head of currency strategy at Brown Brothers Harriman.'"

"'09-09-24,'0','Freddy Bienstock, a prominent music publishing executive who had a long association with Elvis Presley as his designated song screener, died on Sunday at his home in Manhattan. He was 86.His death was announced by his company, Carlin America.Born in Switzerland and reared in Vienna, Mr. Bienstock and his family, who were Jewish, fled to the United States in 1939 and settled in New Jersey. Upon visiting a cousin who worked as a Brill Building song plugger — pitching new material to bandleaders and singers — a star-struck young Mr. Bienstock decided to go into music publishing.At age 14 he got a job as a stockroom clerk at Chappell Music and was soon plugging songs himself, turning to R&B music as the big-band era faded. By the mid-1950s he was working for his cousins Jean and Julian Aberbach, whose company Hill & Range had become the dominant publisher of country music. Like them, Mr. Bienstock had a strong Continental accent and cut an unusually debonair figure for the pop-music business, wearing monogrammed shirts and carrying a monocle on a silk cord.Hill & Range’s most promising client was Presley, and Mr. Bienstock was assigned to find him material. Songwriters, eager to be recorded, urgently satisfied Mr. Bienstock’s every request, said Jerry Leiber, who with Mike Stoller wrote songs like “Jailhouse Rock” and “Don’t” that became hits for Presley.“He’d say, ‘I need a Christmas song, guys,’ ” Mr. Leiber said of Mr. Bienstock in a telephone interview on Wednesday. “‘Get it to me tomorrow morning; I don’t care how good it is.’ So Mike and I would stay up all night and write it.”'"
"'09-09-24,'0','Too many veterans’ disability claims take more than a year to process, the Veterans Affairs Department’s inspector general said. An audit showed that a year ago, 11,000 veterans had claims pending more than a year. It said the agency awarded retroactive payments totaling about $43 million for about a third of them. Of that total, it says about $14 million was unnecessarily delayed. Among the worst cases, the inspector general said, was one involving a veteran who was owed nearly $65,000 for a delayed claim, and another in which a veteran waited more than two years for payment, the inspector general said. The report said the veterans agency had made progress in reducing handling claims, but that delays still created too much of a financial burden for veterans.'"

"'09-09-24,'0','Chevron says that in 1998, Ecuador and its state oil company, Petroecuador, released Texaco from further liability after Texaco’s remediation work was completed.But plaintiffs in the case argue that the release did not deal with private claims against the company.According to Chevron’s filing, the arbitration process will involve three arbitrators. Chevron has appointed Horacio Grigera Naón, from the college of law at American University, Washington, and a Chevron spokesman, Kent Robertson, said Ecuador would appoint a second who would work with Mr. Grigera Naón to appoint a third.The plaintiffs say Texaco dumped billions of gallons of polluted water in the jungle around where they live for more than two decades before leaving Ecuador in the early 1990s. The first legal action in the case was filed in New York in 1993, but the case was moved to Ecuador earlier this decade.An expert appointed by the Ecuadorean court said last year that Chevron should pay around $27 billion, including more than $8 billion in unjust enrichment.Steven Donziger, an American legal adviser to the plaintiffs, said the latest move by Chevron followed a series of setbacks in courts for the company in both countries.“Filing an international arbitration campaign at this point in time smacks of desperation and is a clear example of forum shopping,” Mr. Donziger said in e-mailed statement.As for the Ecuador case, Judge Juan Núñez sought to remove himself from it to allow for an investigation into Chevron’s claims against him, but Mr. Donziger said it had not been allowed.“The judge’s request for recusal has been denied,” Mr. Donziger told Reuters. “Our interest is not in who the judge is. Our interest is that the process be fair.”Chevron has faced increasing media scrutiny over the Ecuadorean case, with a documentary on the dispute opening in New York earlier this month.'"
"'09-09-24,'0','“That’s Mark again, throwing a bomb for his own purposes,” Mr. de Blasio answered.Mr. de Blasio kept up a familiar line of attack on his opponent, reminding the audience that Mr. Green has not been in public service in years. (He has been an author and a lecturer at New York University, among other things.)“I truly respect what Mark did in the ’70s, ’80s and ’90s,” Mr. de Blasio said. “I’m trying to focus on what’s happening in this decade.”As he has done for weeks, Mr. de Blasio painted Mr. Green as out of touch, suggesting that he was not aware of issues important to residents.When Mr. de Blasio was prompted to ask Mr. Green a question, he quizzed him on Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg’s proposal last year to overhaul the city’s senior centers and reduce their funding.“I’m interested to know what you thought of that proposal, your analysis of it, and what you did as a result of your view of the mayor’s proposal,” Mr. de Blasio said.“Thank you, Bill,” Mr. Green said, before stumbling for a second or two. “The issue of senior centers is vital, in this bad economy, with real income down and seniors threatened. It’s vital that they — that we maintain the senior centers as is, which the City Council did do.”It was the third time Mr. de Blasio and Mr. Green met for an official debate. The previous two were crowded affairs, with four candidates behind lecterns (and jostling for their chance at 45-second rebuttals). The Democratic primary last week eliminated Eric N. Gioia, a city councilman from Queens, and Norman Siegel, a civil rights lawyer.In this debate, which was broadcast on NY1 and the radio station WNYC, the candidates were seated side by side, holding clipboards and scribbling notes. They rarely looked directly at each other, one often glancing off to the side as the other talked.No one watching the debate would come away with much insight on the candidates’ positions on the issues, for they were rarely asked about them.They were asked, however, if they had ever fired a gun, visited a strip club or used an illegal drug other than marijuana. (No, no and no, they both said.)And they spent plenty of time name-dropping the endorsements they had collected during the campaign.“Robert F. Kennedy Jr., when he endorsed me,” Mr. Green said in one answer.“The corrections officers endorsed me just today,” Mr. de Blasio said a minute later, not to be outdone.There were signs that some questions in the so-called lightning round, when candidates were asked to respond with a simple yes or no, had become a little tired.At least one of the questions posed by the moderator, Dominic Carter of NY1, had been asked in a previous debate.“Have you ever been arrested?” Mr. Carter said.“You asked me that 10 days ago,” Mr. Green said, impatiently. “Since then I haven’t been arrested, and so, the answer is still no.”Turnout for the Democratic primary on Sept. 15 was at a record low, and political analysts said they expected the turnout in the runoff election on Tuesday to be even lower.Yet a poll released on Wednesday by Quinnipiac University suggested that the public advocate race could be close: Both candidates had 46 percent of the vote, with 7 percent undecided. The poll had a small sample size, 358 likely Democratic primary voters, and a 5.2 percent margin of error.Whoever wins will face the Republican candidate, Alex T. Zablocki, in November.'"
"'09-09-24,'0','In 1996, Congress passed a law that made it much harder for inmates to challenge abusive treatment. It has contributed significantly to the bad conditions — including the desperate overcrowding — that prevail today. The law must be fixed.In the name of clamping down on frivolous lawsuits, the Prison Reform Litigation Act barred prisoners from suing prisons and jails unless they could show that they had suffered a physical injury. Prison officials have used this requirement to block lawsuits challenging all sorts of horrific conditions, including sexual abuse.The law also requires inmates to present their claims to prison officials before filing a suit. The prisons set the rules for those grievance procedures, notes Stephen Bright, the president of the Southern Center for Human Rights, and they have an incentive to make the rules as complicated as possible, so prisoners will not be able to sue. “That has become the main purpose of many grievance systems,” Mr. Bright told Congress last year.In the last Congress, Representative Robert Scott, Democrat of Virginia, sponsored the Prison Abuse Remedies Act. It would have eliminated the physical injury requirement and made it harder for prison officials to get suits dismissed for failure to exhaust grievance procedures. It would have exempted juveniles, who are especially vulnerable to abuse, from the law’s restrictions.The bill’s supporters need to try again this year. Conditions in the nation’s overcrowded prisons are becoming increasingly dangerous; recently, there have been major riots in California and Kentucky. Prisoner lawsuits are a way of reining in the worst abuses, which contribute to prison riots and other violence.The main reason to pass the new law, though, is human decency. The only way to ensure that inmates are not mistreated is to guarantee them a fair opportunity to bring their legitimate complaints to court.'"

"'09-09-24,'0','Even the smallest of nonprofits ventured into the world of high finance.A decade ago, Family Service of Greater Boston, a 174-year-old social services agency with an annual budget of about $6 million, sold its nine-story row house on Beacon Hill. Rather than use the $8.1 million in proceeds to buy a new building, Family Service put the money from the sale into its endowment and floated $8 million in variable-rate tax-exempt bonds tied to a swap contract that protected it from interest rate fluctuations.“The thinking was that dividends and interest on the investments would be at least sufficient to make payments on the notes,” said Randal Rucker, the group’s chief executive.In fact, investment income never sufficiently covered payments on the bonds, which ended up costing it roughly $800,000 a year — or about 12 percent of its annual budget.Late last year, with a balloon payment on the bonds looming and its endowment’s value down by more than 20 percent, Family Service had reached what Mr. Rucker called “a very important and undesirable decision point” to lay off staff members and discontinue some programs or reduce all programs across the board.Then it got lucky. Under a new federal program, the charity was able to refinance its bonds, reducing its debt service costs by more than half.“I think the strategy was right back then,” Mr. Rucker said. “In hindsight, I might have done some things differently. The assumption was that the market would always give about an 8 percent return, and no one projected we would be in the situation we are now.”'"
"'09-09-24,'0','While debt is the not primary reason for these institutions’ woes, the need to service it eats into their dwindling financial resources, forcing near Faustian choices. “Debt is the fourth horseman of the nonprofit apocalypse,” Ms. Miller said. “Add it to the failure of governments to fulfill contracts, declining donated revenues and a surge in demand for nonprofit services, and suddenly a lot of nonprofits are faced with some very hard choices.”Much of the nonprofits’ debt is in the form of tax-exempt bonds. The number of charities issuing such bonds more than doubled from 1993 to 2006, according to figures compiled by the Internal Revenue Service, and the amount of debt linked to those bonds rose to $311 billion from $98 billion (adjusted for inflation to 2006 dollars).In many cases, charities used the money from bonds to buy real estate and build facilities. Prep schools added golf courses, pools and observatories. Colleges bought entire neighborhoods and put up labs and sports facilities. Museums erected new wings, and symphonies added thousands of seats to their concert halls.These nonprofits gambled that income from donations and investments would more than cover their debt service. But the recession turned that logic inside out.Norman I. Silber, a law professor at Hofstra University who has done extensive research on the problem, calls the rising debt of nonprofits a “calamity.”“If my analysis is correct,” said Professor Silber, who is also a member of several nonprofit boards, “over the next several years nonprofits across the country will have to renegotiate bond covenants, reduce services, cut staff or actually default and face foreclosures, repossessions, and in some cases, even bankruptcy.”Before 1986, only nonprofit hospitals were allowed to float tax-exempt bonds, which they used to build new facilities. Then Congress amended the tax code to allow all charities access to the credit markets, and now even the tiny Family Service of Greater Boston has tax-exempt bond liabilities.To be sure, the assets at nonprofits grew faster than bond-related debt. In the dozen years that ended in 2006, the value of assets held by nonprofits grew to $1.37 trillion from $347 billion (adjusted for inflation to 2006 dollars), thanks to more large gifts, increased property values, rising stock prices — and the explosion of tax-exempt debt.“I think one could make a good argument that the greatest contributor to the enormous growth in university endowments and other endowments is not some wealthy person or persons,” said Robert L. Culver, chief executive of MassDevelopment, a state agency that supports nonprofits’ floating bonds, “but the federal government making available low-cost, tax-exempt debt that allowed endowments to remain invested and earn rates in the market as high as 25 percent.”Traditionally, projected income determined how much debt an organization could handle, but Professor Silber suspects that as assets grew, lenders began extending credit based on how much money a nonprofit had in its endowment.“Now, those assets have dropped in value by 20, 30 percent, but the amount of debt hasn’t changed,” he said.Consider the case of New York Law School, which floated $135 million in auction-rate securities in 2006 in a deal that won an award for the creative use of structured finance.The school had sold its library, on prime Manhattan real estate, for $136.5 million, but instead of building a library, it added the money from the sale to its endowment and borrowed for construction. Interest on the securities was just under 4 percent, the dean, Richard A. Matasar, said, compared with the 5.5 percent the school would have paid using ordinary fixed-rate bonds.The Tax Code bars nonprofits from taking money raised with tax-exempt bonds and investing it in higher-yielding investments, a form of arbitrage. But it does not prohibit the strategy used by New York Law School, which many tax experts regard as a major flaw in the law.“Congress’s intent in allowing charities to use bonds is to help them achieve their missions — build a health care center or a preschool,” said Dean Zerbe, former tax counsel to the Senate Finance Committee, “not to engage in fast and loose financial games.”Mr. Matasar said the school did not engage in arbitrage. “The fact that we were fortunate enough to be able to sell a building to raise additional funds was a separate and distinct transaction,” he said.When the credit market began souring last year, interest rates climbed sharply, hitting 12 percent in one week as buyers failed to show up for auctions of the school’s securities.In December, New York Law School refinanced its debt, converting its securities into variable-rate notes secured by a letter of credit, Mr. Matasar said. Its endowment had fallen 20 percent to $186 million.The Culinary Institute of America ramped up its use of tax-exempt bonds to finance construction of facilities. By the end of 2007, it had $104 million in debt, about 70 percent of which was auction-rate. Charlie O’Mara, the institute’s chief financial officer, figured it saved about $750,000 in financing costs that way. “It would have been a great strategy,” he said, “if our credit markets did not blow up.”Like New York Law School, the institute saw its cheap financing evaporate when its bond insurer was downgraded and the auction market vanished. The institute was able to refinance its debt. But experts predict that many charities, particularly cultural organizations that are seeing declining revenues, will have a harder time.Soliciting donors to pay off debt “would be like me going to my husband and saying, ‘Give me money because I spent too much at Saks Fifth Avenue,’ ” said Naomi Levine, a former star fund-raiser for New York University who now teaches at the university’s Heyman Center for Philanthropy. “It would be very, very difficult.”'"
"'09-09-24,'0','N.B.A. owners and players held another “information-sharing session” on Wednesday, a precursor to negotiations aimed at reaching a new labor deal by the summer of 2011.The talks are broad and cordial, and designed to lay the foundation for the more difficult discussions to come. In a joint statement, representatives of the National Basketball Association and the players union called the three-hour meeting productive.“These are preliminary meetings and clearly there will be more dialogue ahead, but we are glad to be talking at this very early stage,” the statement said.There are two years left on the current collective bargaining agreement and ample time to reach a new agreement. But several teams are losing money and the league is concerned about the effects of the worldwide recession.Some longtime N.B.A. observers have predicted that owners will seek radical changes to the league’s economic system, including a reduced share of revenue for players and perhaps a hard salary cap. The players generally support retaining the current system, albeit with some modest adjustments.“The tone of our conversations still continues to be very positive, very optimistic, very sincere,” Derek Fisher, the president of the players union, said after the meeting at a Manhattan hotel. “So those are all good things that I’m excited about at this point.”'"

"'09-09-24,'0','As the economy worsened and consumer sentiment plunged, coupon redemption ticked up 10 percent in the fourth quarter of 2008, compared with the period a year ago — the first jump in coupon redemption since the early 1990s. In the first half of this year, coupon redemption climbed 23 percent. Some 1.6 billion coupons were redeemed, leading Inmar to forecast that more than three billion coupons will be redeemed this year.More of them are being redeemed by consumers who have long avoided coupons.“The households that tend to not coupon as much are all couponing significantly more this year versus last year,” said Neil Heffernan, senior vice president and general manager for the research company Knowledge Networks/PDI. The group’s most recent figures show that in January and February combined, coupon use among young, single consumers with minimal savings rose 14 percent, in contrast to the same months last year.Coupon use among another group — affluent consumers born in the late 1950s and 1960s — rose percent in January and February, compared with the same months in the previous year. Data from Nielsen published last month underscored this trend, showing that households earning $70,000 or more a year were among the top coupon users.Matthew Tilley, director of marketing for Inmar, said that coupon use was growing most among such groups and that they were the ones driving traffic to Web sites with printable coupons, like and . Redemption of printable coupons, which span the divide between old-fashioned paper coupons and newer digital versions, grew 308 percent in the first half of this year, from a small base.“I believe it’s not coincidental that the spike in coupon redemption began just as some of the worst economic news hit the front pages,” Mr. Tilley said, adding that coupon-cutting is but one more way consumers are changing their habits. “Folks are going back to the basics,” he said, “trying to live simpler lives.”Coupon redemption was also spurred on by marketers who dangled more valuable deals. Mr. Tilley said there was a 9 percent increase last year in the face value of coupons. That has declined slightly this year, though; marketers know more consumers are using coupons, and companies can afford to pull back a bit.“It is a sign of the times,” said Kelly McFalls, a spokeswoman for , which accepts manufacturers’ coupons. Underscoring the nationwide trend, more BJ’s shoppers are using such coupons, as well as the BJ’s store coupons.Digital coupon use, on the Web and on cellphones, is also growing. In the first half of this year about 10 million digital coupons were redeemed, up 25 percent compared with the period a year earlier, according to Inmar. However, paper coupons still make up the bulk of coupons redeemed in the nation, with digital coupons accounting for less than half a percent of all coupons distributed.The primacy of paper over pixels is partly because new methods of digitally distributing coupons have yet to fully catch on. It is also because many grocery and drug stores still offer coupons inside weekend newspapers. Indeed, in the first half of this year there was a 29 percent increase in coupons distributed for food products, in contrast to the period a year ago, according to Inmar. As Mr. Tilley put it, that “is going to boost redemption because everybody’s got to eat.”Consumer posit yet another reason for the popularity of paper coupons: Because it takes more work to acquire them, the people who do so feel they have outsmarted other shoppers.“Saving money so often means not doing something, as in not buying something,” Ms. Yarrow said. “Coupon-clipping has a proactive quality to it that appeals to bargain hunters.”And though some consumers know about mobile coupon services like Cellfire, scholars say shoppers still have concerns about privacy and security. “In the same way it took a while for A.T.M.’s to catch on,” Ms. Yarrow said, “I think it’ll take a bit longer for the mobile coupons to become mainstream.”Coupon devotees see the enterprise as vast game of saving money, and they share tips through increasingly popular Web sites.One of their strategies is to hold onto their coupons until the store puts those items on sale — typically a month or so after the coupons are first offered. Coupon clippers who regularly save about half of their weekly grocery bill say it is because they watch store fliers to find out when items will go on sale and then use their coupons on top of the sale price.“Sometimes the coupon brings you down to nearly zero dollars,” said Susan J. Samtur of Scarsdale, N.Y., who is known in bargain-hunting circles as the coupon queen.While some consumers dismiss coupon-cutting as too time-consuming, adept coupon users contend it is a matter of getting into the habit, though it does require discipline.Longtime coupon users, for instance, do not keep coupons crumpled up in their wallets. They opt for small accordion folders with tabs for shopping categories that correspond to store aisles, like “baking” and “frozen foods.” They keep scissors on hand. They clip coupons on Sundays and file them while on the subway, or while boiling water for spaghetti. And they paper-clip coupons to their shopping lists so they do not forget to use them.Another way coupon clippers save is by shedding brand loyalty and buying whatever is on sale. Ms. Samtur, who hunts for coupons for consumers at , is so good at it that she also shops for her adult children — including the girlfriends of two of her sons.“I’m paying 30 cents for the yogurt, and they’re not fussy,” she said, “so long as it’s the low-fat ones.”Also, coupon mavens point out that even if a coupon expires, stores may be flexible about the rules for their own coupons. Ms. Hernandez of Houston, who chronicles her deals at , recently spent more than $50 on groceries, then found out she missed a deal for $10 off any purchase of $50 or more. She went back to the store with her receipt and got $10 back.“It never hurts to ask,” she said.'"
"'09-09-24,'0','A committee charged with examining the future of the Rose Art Museum at Brandeis University, which trustees voted in January to close as the university’s finances worsened, has recommended that the museum remain open. But in a report issued on Wednesday, the group, made up of faculty members, students, university officials and trustees, stopped short of saying whether or not Brandeis should proceed with a plan to sell pieces from the museum’s collection to help shore up the university’s endowment. The committee recommended that the museum “should remain what it is and what it has been since its beginnings” and become more integrated into the university’s educational mission. As for selling the works, the group wrote that it assumed that whatever decision the university made, there would “remain a substantial collection of art to be preserved and made available for research, study and cultivation.”'"
"'09-09-24,'0','This generosity reflects a changing attitude toward the unemployed, said John Challenger, chief executive of the out-placement agency Challenger, Gray & Christmas.“There’s more empathy out there because everyone has friends and family who are caught up in this,” Mr. Challenger said. “There isn’t the stigma that there used to be, because there’s so much no-fault job loss.”While the offers sometimes generate skepticism among the unemployed, many report being pleasantly surprised by the quality of the services and the professionalism of the personnel.Michael Dixon, a software engineer from Seattle who is out of work, was prepared to be disappointed when he attended a two-day event last week at Flint Men’s Grooming, a salon in Bellevue, Wash., that was offering free haircuts, suits and career counseling to the jobless. “I thought it might be an up-sell, where they get you in and then immediately put you in front of a salesperson,” said Mr. Dixon, 35.So he was stunned when a staff member escorted him to a room full of high-quality gently used suits and provided him with a tailor, as well as a free shirt and tie, all of which he estimates would have cost him $1,000 otherwise.Michelle Immel had a similar experience at Visage à Visage. Ms. Immel, a 41-year-old single mother, was initially reluctant to request a free cut and blow dry. Since losing her administrative job five months earlier, she’d had her share of humbling experiences, like frequenting the local food bank with her head down and her face shaded by a baseball cap. But at Visage à Visage, only the staff members knew she was a pro bono client, and Ms. Immel says they treated her as well as, if not better than, the salon’s paying customers, even offering to trim her 2-year-old daughter’s hair, too.“They really took the time to make you feel good,” Ms. Immel said. “That helps because when you’re unemployed you can get to the point where you start looking down on yourself.”Because the effects of this recession are so widespread, there is also a stronger sense of humility among the still-employed, as business owners see customers dwindle and employees brace for the next round of layoffs.Gary Donlin, the owner of the Quail Hollow Golf and Country Club in Oakham, Mass., said gratitude for his own job inspired him to offer free weekday golfing to the unemployed. He had noticed that membership was down — both because of golfers who had lost jobs and those who feared they might — and he realized that his longtime customers shouldn’t be taken for granted.“These were the people who had given us a job for 18 years,” said Mr. Donlin, 64. “If they didn’t have a job, then what kind of people would we be if we didn’t help them?”However noble the intentions, though, these programs do offer some financial upsides. If the barber chair or golf course would otherwise be empty, why not generate some good will and positive press with free services?And Mr. Donlin notes that the laid-off golfers frequently bring paying friends, who often rent golf carts and buy sandwiches and beer at the clubhouse. “It hasn’t been a completely one-way street,” he said.There is also the hope that such offers will build future clientele.Janet Raiffa, an unemployed law firm recruiter who writes a column for a networking organization in New York called the 405 Club (named for the state’s maximum unemployment benefit of $405 a week), said that many businesses now recognize that the jobless are a group worth investing in, like students.“There are a lot of lawyers and investment bankers who made a lot of money in the past and will make a lot of money in the future,” Ms. Raiffa said. “They may be low now, but it’s still a population you want to build inroads with.”Offering free services is no guarantee that beneficiaries will eventually become paying customers. Ms. Raiffa now works out at New York Underground Fitness, which offers free memberships to jobless people when they show their unemployment stub each month. But she admits that she has frozen her membership to a fancier club and intends to return once she finds a job.Eric Slayton, the owner of Underground, said he is fine with that, insisting that his offer is a gift, not a marketing strategy.“Everyone said, ‘That’s a good idea, that’s a good marketing idea,’ but that isn’t the point,” said Mr. Slayton, 40, who said he feels a responsibility to back up his advice to unemployed friends that they stay fit and keep their stress level down. “It might sound corny, but I’m sincere.”Whatever the motives, business owners do need to be mindful that their good deeds aren’t punished.Last April, Giuseppe Lazzara, the owner of Papa Joe’s Barbershop in Chandler, Ariz., placed a sign in his window offering free haircuts to the jobless, after several of his regular customers said they were out of work and couldn’t afford a trim.“I felt like someone was stepping on my heart, so I said, ‘You’ve been coming here for 20 years, you’ve been supporting me, so I will give you a free haircut,’ ” said Mr. Lazzara, 69, who is known as Joe.Two weeks later, a local television station featured a story on Papa Joe’s. Soon Mr. Lazzara’s barber chair was full of laid-off workers from across the Phoenix area; he estimates he gave out 150 cuts — none to his original customers. So in June he quietly took the sign out of his window.“If someone comes in and says they are having a hard time, I’ll give them a cut, but I don’t advertise it anymore,” he said. “I would go out of business.”To contain their exposure, many businesses limit their offers to one-day events or designate specific hours or days of the week as free periods.Integral Yoga Institute in New York, for example, offers a class called Free Yoga and Networking for the Unemployed every Wednesday evening (the jobless can also get discounts for regular classes).Pooling resources also helps. Anita Astley, a marriage and family therapist from Clifton Park, N.Y., teamed up with other professionals — including a psychiatric nurse, a social worker and a career counselor — to form Professionals Without Fees, which offers four free sessions to the unemployed.“I can’t take everyone who calls, but I can refer them to other mental-health professionals in the network,” said Ms. Astley, 40.At Visage à Visage, Ms. Stoltzfus hasn’t imposed any formal limits on the number of cuts she will give away — she said the current count is nearly 100 — but she does keep a list to ensure that first-timers have priority over return visitors. And since her salon does not ask for proof of unemployment, she has encountered the occasional scammer.“That hurts,” she said. “But then the next minute you have someone who really needs it, so you decide it’s O.K.”Fortunately, Ms. Stoltzfus said,  the majority of customers are honorable, and some, like Ms. Immel, now have jobs and are returning as paying clients.“We’ve gone back for basic haircuts,” Ms. Immel said. “We’re not ready to get the $200 daily treatment yet, but we’ll get there.”'"
"'09-09-24,'0','It is normal for companies to discover billions of barrels of new oil every year, but this year’s pace is unusually brisk. New oil discoveries have totaled about 10 billion barrels in the first half of the year, according to IHS Cambridge Energy Research Associates. If discoveries continue at that pace through year-end, they are likely to reach the highest level since 2000.While recent years have featured speculation about a coming peak and subsequent decline in oil production, people in the industry say there is still plenty of oil in the ground, especially beneath the ocean floor, even if finding and extracting it is becoming harder. They say that prices and the pace of technological improvement remain the principal factors governing oil production capacity.While the industry is celebrating the recent discoveries, many executives are anxious about the immediate future, fearing that lower prices might jeopardize their exploration drive. The world economy is weak, oil prices have tumbled from last year’s records, corporate profits have shrunk, and global demand for oil remains low. After falling to $34 in December, oil prices have doubled, stabilizing near $70 a barrel. But if the world economy does not pick up, some analysts believe the price could fall again.Oil companies contend that is not a prospect they can afford. Despite reaping record profits in recent years, many executives have warned that they need prices above $60 a barrel to develop the world’s more challenging reserves. In fact, some exploration activity has already slowed this year, as producers seek better terms from service companies and contractors.It is not just oil that is benefiting from the exploration boom. Repsol, Spain’s biggest oil company, said this month that it had discovered what could turn out to be Venezuela’s biggest natural gas field. In recent years, companies have found substantial natural gas reserves in the United States, from shale rocks once believed to be impossible to drill.“The No. 1 question that exploration teams have right now is, Where do we go next?” said Robert Fryklund, who ran the operations of ConocoPhillips in Libya and Brazil, and is a vice president in Houston at Cambridge Energy Research Associates.Exploration spending swelled in recent years, partly to offset a doubling of costs throughout the industry — from steel prices to the cost of renting deepwater drilling rigs. A big issue confronting the industry now is how to drive down costs while maintaining a high level of exploration. On average, costs have fallen by 15 to 20 percent from their peak, according to petroleum executives.Exploration remains a risky, and costly, business, where some deepwater wells can cost up to $100 million. From 30 to 50 percent of exploration wells find oil.Some executives are also worried the world might face a shortfall in supplies in coming years if another decline in oil prices causes exploration to falter.The chief executive of the French oil giant Total, Christophe de Margerie, has warned that such a supply crunch is possible by the middle of the next decade. “There could be a shortage of capacity,” he said.His concerns echoed those of Abdullah al-Badri, the secretary general of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, who said that lower oil prices also threatened investments by OPEC nations.Saudi Arabia is also unlikely to expand its production in coming years because of the uncertainty clouding future oil demand, Ali al-Naimi, the kingdom’s oil minister, signaled earlier this month. Saudi Arabia is just completing a $100 billion program to increase its capacity to 12.5 million barrels a day, from around 9 million barrels a day just a few years ago.Although they are substantial, the new finds do not match the giant fields discovered in the 1970s, like Alaska’s Prudhoe Bay, Ekofisk in the North Sea, or Cantarell in Mexico. They are also dwarfed by the last enormous discovery, the Kashagan field in the Caspian Sea, discovered in 2000 and estimated to hold over 20 billion barrels of oil.“We have not seen another Kashagan, but still these finds are very material,” said Alan Murray, the exploration service manager at Wood Mackenzie, a consulting firm in Edinburgh.Since the early 1980s, discoveries have failed to keep up with the global rate of oil consumption, which last year reached 31 billion barrels of oil. Instead, companies have managed to expand production by finding new ways of getting more oil out of existing fields, or producing oil through unconventional sources, like Canada’s tar sands or heavy oil in Venezuela.Reserve estimates typically rise over the life of a field, which can often be productive for decades, as companies find new ways of getting more oil out of the ground.The industry’s record has improved in recent years, thanks to high prices. According to Cambridge Energy Research Associates, oil companies have found more oil than they produced for the last two years through a combination of exploration and field expansions.“The appetite for opening new frontiers when prices were low in the 1990s was very small,” said Paolo Scaroni, the chief executive of Italy’s oil giant Eni. “Today, the biggest discovery of all is technology.”One of the largest finds this year was made by a small producer, Heritage Oil, at the Miran West One field in the Kurdistan region of northern Iraq. It found nearly two billion barrels of oil and plans to drill a second well before the end of the year. While the central government of Iraq has had a hard time attracting investors to develop its huge fields, local authorities in Kurdistan have been successfully wooing foreign producers.Meanwhile, in the Gulf of Mexico, BP’s discovery proves that the area remains one of the most promising oil regions in the United States. BP has estimated that the Tiber field holds four billion to six billion barrels of oil and gas, which would be enough, in theory, to meet domestic consumption for more than a year.“In 30 years I’ve been in the business, the Gulf of Mexico has been called the Dead Sea countless times,” said Bobby Ryan, the vice president of global exploration at Chevron. “And yet it continues to revitalize itself.”'"
"'09-09-24,'0','Banks “need to be willing, like the regulator, to recognize that there are some profitable activities so unlikely to have a social benefit, direct or indirect, that they should voluntarily walk away from them,” Mr. Turner told the group. When the dinner broke up and the crowd spilled out into the foyer, many bankers shook their heads.Mr. Turner’s critique of modern finance is turning heads on both sides of the Atlantic. His central thesis — that banking has assumed an outsize role in economic life — is anathema to many of his establishment peers. And his proposed tax, known as a “Tobin tax,” after James Tobin, the economist, strikes many of them as downright dangerous. Such a tax would siphon jobs and business from the City, his detractors say.Labour and Conservative politicians seem to have finally found a point on which they agree: The City is vital to Britain, and imposing the kind of tax that Mr. Turner suggests would threaten London’s status as a premier financial center.But to Mr. Turner, the point has been less about his proposal — a pragmatist, he realizes that there is little chance such a tax would win international support — than the reaction to it. The uproar shows that the “quasi-religious” dogma of finance — that the markets are always right and that governments should let money flow freely around the world — is as ingrained as ever, he said. But now more than ever, given the events of the past year, regulators must challenge such notions, he said.“We have begun to accept this idea that liquidity is the new God,” Mr. Turner said in an interview earlier this month.“The ideology of efficient markets became deeply embedded within the regulatory community,” he continued. “And if you are of the belief that we have to challenge this, then you can’t help not to make speeches about it.”And that is exactly what Mr. Turner has done, almost from the day that he took over as chairman of the Financial Services Authority during the very week that Lehman Brothers collapsed.Part Cambridge don, part moralist, he has, in effect, been running a tutorial on the origins of the crisis, and what must be done, to a class consisting of his fellow regulators, politicians, bankers and the broader public.In March, he published the Turner Review, a 126-page report that combined eye-catching charts, intricate economic analysis and an overlay of thinly veiled disgust. It became required reading in the City, as well as on Wall Street and in Washington. On Capitol Hill, Mr. Turner has established a working rapport with Representative Barney Frank of Massachusetts, the chairman of the House Financial Services Committee.Mr. Turner is certainly an unlikely rebel. He became wealthy working at McKinsey, the consulting company, and in 1995 became head of the Confederation of British Industry, Britain’s main business lobby.Chairmanships to high-level policy panels followed, covering topics from the minimum wage, pensions and climate change — all sandwiched between a job as vice chairman of Merrill Lynch Europe from 2000 to 2006.Some suspect that Mr. Turner — who was nicknamed Red Adair in the 1990s after he wondered aloud if British workers had an adequate share of the economy — takes a dim view of free markets in general and enjoys railing against them.Asked about Mr. Turner’s views, a top civil servant in the Treasury smirked and rolled his eyes. Prime Minister Gordon Brown has played down Mr. Turner’s tax proposal. Such a tax would be impossible without international cooperation, the prime minister maintains. He made it clear that the British government would not be pushing for the tax at the Group of 20 meeting.And if, as expected, the Conservatives win this spring’s general election, the Tories will end the F.S.A.’s autonomy and squeeze the agency into the Bank of England.Even Mr. Turner’s peers in the academic community remain skeptical.“The Tobin tax is an old and bad story,” said Richard Portes, a professor of economics at the London Business School. “It wouldn’t curb speculation, and it would have no effect on the size of the banking sector.”Mr. Turner, in the interview, conceded that the odds for his tax were slim. But he said bankers and regulators should not be so quick to dismiss it. “I can understand if you have really looked at it. But they are saying it will never work,” Mr. Turner said. “And sometimes there are things that may not work that are quite worth investigating.”'"
"'09-09-24,'0','The move comes as governments across the nation struggle to solve what public health advocates call an epidemic of obesity and diabetes. Schools have banned sugary drinks; lawmakers have helped urban farms spread like crabgrass on undeveloped lots; and cities like Los Angeles and Berkeley, Calif., have limited the concentration of fast-food restaurants in low-income areas.But the New York proposal, adapted from a Pennsylvania program that provides grants and loans for supermarket construction, is unusual because it employs a mix of zoning and financial incentives to attract, rather than repel, a narrowly defined type of commercial enterprise.“It is exciting to see that City Planning is taking an initiative to address food because the planning profession has really ignored the food system for the past 100 years,” said Nevin Cohen, an assistant professor of urban studies at the New School, pointing out that the Bloomberg administration’s elaborate blueprint to guide future development, PlaNYC 2030, barely mentions food.The new zoning would break down some barriers that grocery stores face, said Ben Thomases, the city’s food policy coordinator, including competition from drugstores and other retailers that have higher profit margins than supermarkets do and can pay higher rents.Under the proposed rules, a residential building with a fresh-food store could be up to 20,000 square feet larger than would normally be allowed, enabling developers to make more money by building more apartments.Smaller stores in certain commercial and manufacturing districts would be exempt from a requirement that they provide customer parking. And in manufacturing districts, developers could build stores of up to 30,000 square feet — the current limit is 10,000 — without going through the city’s laborious and expensive land-use review process.Although there has been little opposition to the proposal’s goals, labor leaders have insisted that the stores be required to pay so-called living wages and offer health benefits to employees.There is little consensus outside the administration that the program would significantly change eating habits, especially in a grim economy.A recent report to Congress by the Department of Agriculture said that the relationship between access to good food and obesity was “not well understood” by experts. It concluded that more research was needed to identify the many factors that can guide food choices.Indeed, the city’s earlier efforts to make fresh foods more readily available in poor neighborhoods have yielded mixed results.Efforts to encourage the city’s bodegas to stock low-fat milk and fresh produce have been less successful than originally hoped, with health department officials now focusing their efforts on 60 stores every six months, rather than the roughly 1,000 they started with in the two programs in 2006.And though there is anecdotal evidence that customers have been flocking to some of the fruit and vegetable carts the city is helping to place along the sidewalks of poor neighborhoods, it is too early to know if there will be enough demand to keep them in business.Avi Kaner, a co-owner of Morton Williams, which operates 12 supermarkets in New York and New Jersey, including two in the Bronx, praised the new proposal as a “very worthy endeavor to improve nutrition,” but said the city should focus on education in attacking the root causes of obesity and diet-related illness.“If you force distribution of product to a population that’s not interested in it, or not educated in it, and the grocery stores can’t make a profit,” he said, “they’ll eventually leave.”City officials, who have mounted several public education campaigns to improve nutrition, point to the rising use of food stamps at farmers’ markets and the crowds of shoppers at the enormous Pathmark on 125th Street in East Harlem as proof of the pent-up demand for locally grown cauliflower and packages of boneless chicken breasts in the so-called food deserts that lack them.The Pennsylvania program, for instance, has, over the last four years, financed 74 supermarkets across the state, about a quarter of them in Philadelphia; relatively few have gone out of business. In addition, the markets have created or preserved thousands of jobs and stimulated economic development around them, supporters of the approach say. New York officials said they expected to help create 15 new stores and upgrade 10 existing ones.The plan appears to be as much about economics as it is about changing unhealthy habits. Supporters say that more supermarkets will bring sales tax revenue to the city and sorely needed jobs to poor communities, while encouraging gentrification to continue its sweep across the boroughs.“If you’re thinking of moving your family to the Lower Concourse,” Ms. Burden said, referring to a large manufacturing area in the South Bronx that the commission recently rezoned to include residential construction, “you’re going to say, like, ‘Wow, there is no grocery store here. I’m not going to move here.’ ”The new stores’ primary business must be selling groceries, and the zoning proposal is explicit about just what they must sell: Of a minimum of 6,000 square feet devoted to grocery items, at least 3,000 square feet must be reserved for food.The proposal would also require store owners to display signs at the entrances that include a special “Fresh” logo from the planning department and the statement, “This store sells fresh food.”Many supermarket chains, from bargain to upscale ones, said they hoped to take advantage of the incentives.“It’s definitely enticing for us,” said Christina Minardi, president for the Northeast region at Whole Foods. She said that the chain, which has half a dozen stores in Manhattan, had been sporadically looking to open a store in Harlem, an area it might not typically move into, but where “an incentive might help.”Generally, she said, Whole Foods stores need a certain concentration of “people that live our lifestyle,” which includes a concern for “what they’re putting into their bodies.” Santino Montalbano, the director of real estate for Western Beef, which operates a number of large warehouse-style stores in mixed-income New York neighborhoods, also praised the proposal, which he said would make it easier to compete with stores like Rite Aid.“They’re just making more on their drugs than we are” on groceries, he said. “We’re just making pennies on our cans of corn.”'"
"'09-09-24,'0','Consumer groups offered a measured response to the changes, expressing some relief that a stand-alone consumer-protection agency had not been scrapped altogether. “I don’t think anything here is intended to weaken or eviscerate this in any way,” said Ed Mierzwinski, consumer program director at the United States Public Interest Research Group. “The agency will still have a primary role of protecting consumers, and it will still have authorities.”The legislation still faces major hurdles in Congress, where bankers hold considerable political sway. has asked lawmakers to approve a comprehensive bill this year, mindful that if the economy continues to mend, the political impetus could evaporate.Senator , Democrat of and head of the Senate banking committee, is soon expected to file his own version of a comprehensive bill.That legislation is likely to include a measure introduced this week by Senator , Democrat of , to impose tighter regulations on dealers. Mr. Reed’s measure would require that — a form of against bond defaults — be traded through clearinghouses. Top officials at the and the have called for tougher regulation of the derivatives market than the White House has.An Obama proposal that Mr. Frank rejected would have required and other financial services companies to offer so-called plain vanilla products, like 30-year fixed mortgages and low-interest, low-fee credit cards.That proposal set off criticism by Democrats and Republicans, some with close ties to the banking industry, that it was the first step toward having government bureaucrats approve and disapprove an array of products.At a hearing on Wednesday before the financial services committee, Secretary said: “There has been a lot of concern that if you invest the government with the ability to decide what’s appropriate here and there, that will lead to less competition and choice. The chairman’s proposals, which I’ve had a chance to read quickly, provide a better balance of choice and protection.”Mr. Frank said his measure would exempt various businesses — like merchants, retailers and providers of plans — from oversight by the consumer financial protection agency.Both Mr. Frank and Mr. Geithner emphasized that the legislation would be intended to limit the “too big to fail” policy of bailing out the nation’s largest institutions. That policy, which has provoked widespread voter anger, was central to the bailouts of and the American International Group and led to big loans to the largest banks in the nation.“We will be putting a package of legislation together that will substantially diminish that problem,” Mr. Frank said. “We will be providing for mechanisms for putting financial institutions out of their misery. There will be death panels enacted by this Congress, but they will be for large institutions that are seen as too big to die. We are talking here about dissolution, not resolution. We are talking about making it unpleasant for these institutions to die.”Mr. Geithner said those institutions whose problems could shake the financial system would face far greater regulatory scrutiny and higher capital standards. But under questioning from Representative Spencer Bachus of Alabama, the ranking Republican on the committee, he refused to rule out the possibility of more bailouts of big companies.“You can’t have a system, how shall I say it, where you abolish the fire station, or lock the doors to the fire station,” Mr. Geithner said. “That’s not a system that works.”'"

"'09-09-25,'0','A federal bankruptcy court judge in Delaware on Thursday approved the Tribune Company’s $845 million sale of the Chicago Cubs to the family of Joe Ricketts, the founder of the TD Ameritrade discount brokerage. One of his sons, Tom, will be the controlling owner.The sale still must go through a Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing of the Cubs on Oct. 12, to divest the team of debt associated with Tribune, and a three-quarters vote of Major League Baseball owners. The team’s bankruptcy process is expected to be quick and could be approved at a hearing scheduled for Oct. 13.In signing the approval order, Judge Kevin J. Carey said, “The evidence demonstrates” that Tribune “has a sound business reason” for the transaction. He wrote in the order that the sale “represents the best proposed transaction for the Cubs business,” and that the Ricketts family has “acted reasonably, properly and in good faith.”Carey will also preside over the Cubs’ bankruptcy.For its $845 million, the Ricketts family will get the Cubs, Wrigley Field and 25 percent of Comcast SportsNet Chicago, the regional cable network that carries Cubs games. Tribune will retain a 5 percent interest in the assets.The sale is structured as a transfer that is designed to save Tribune taxes. Allan Sloan, a senior editor of Fortune magazine, says that Tribune is seeking to avoid paying nearly $300 million in taxes. “Everyone calls what’s going on a sale except for the people handling Tribune’s taxes, who call it a tax-free distribution,” he said.'"
"'09-09-25,'0','WASHINGTON (AP) — Millions of Medicare patients would not face increases in their monthly premiums next year under a bill passed by the House on Thursday.The House voted 406 to 18 to eliminate all premium increases for people who use Medicare Part B, which pays for doctor visits. The bill now goes to the Senate.Lawmakers said older Americans should not have to pay higher Medicare Part B premiums because they were not expected to get a cost of living increase from Social Security. Most people have their Medicare premiums deducted from their Social Security payments.About three-fourths of the 42 million Medicare recipients are already exempt from Part B premium increases whenever there is no increase in Social Security payments, a decision that is based on the inflation rate. Still, without Congressional action, several million others who are older or disabled would face monthly premium increases of $8 to $23. The standard monthly premium is $96.40 this year.Most of the 11 million or so patients who are not exempt from premium increases are low-income people who also qualify for Medicaid, the state-federal health insurance program for the poor. Medicaid pays their Medicare premiums, meaning states would bear some of the costs.The bill would not affect scheduled increases in premiums for the Medicare prescription drug program, known as Part D. Average monthly premiums for the drug program will increase slightly, to $30 in 2010 from $28 this year.'"

"'09-09-25,'0','The two sides are spending heavily for TV advertisements featuring ominous images of the opposing candidate and narrators intoning darkly about his misdeeds and character flaws.Adding to the gloom is the state’s battered economy. Unemployment here has risen to 9.7 percent, the highest in three decades, and the riches that once flowed from Wall Street are evaporating. With refugees from the financial industry crowding unemployment offices, home values plunging and budget deficits stretching to the horizon, Mr. Corzine and Mr. Christie hack away at each other over each new bit of dreary economic news.Just a year after Mr. Obama inspired Americans to vote their hopes, the two rivals seem to be appealing strictly to the electorate’s fears. Mr. Christie blames Mr. Corzine for the state’s choking tax burden, housing crunch and population exodus. Another four years of the “out of touch” Democrat will drive the state and its residents to financial ruin, he says, adding, “We can no longer afford Jon Corzine.”Mr. Corzine counters by cautioning New Jersey’s moderate voters that with no end to the economic crisis in sight, Mr. Christie, who was a Bush appointee, would choose conservatism over compassion and slash the educational and social programs that are vital to their quality of life. “Wrong when it matters most,” his TV ads say of Mr. Christie.The tone, all gritted teeth, slashing attack and grim-faced defense, seems to be discouraging voters, who are desperate for signs of economic brightening.“New Jersey’s economy has been hit worse than almost any place in the country, so people are already worrying about whether it will get worse,” said Eddie Punte, a Democrat who was working in a flower shop in the Ironbound section of Newark last week. “And when the politicians keep talking about how bad it is and how bad it’s going to get, it just makes people nervous.”Neither man bothers to say much about what he would do if elected. Mr. Christie mouths gauzy goals about fiscal responsibility, spending cuts and ethics and regulatory reform, but refuses to get pinned down; he would rather let his forceful personality and record of locking up corrupt politicians stack up against what he sees as Mr. Corzine’s fecklessness and unfulfilled campaign promises.Mr. Corzine, meanwhile, is not asking voters to stay the course; he is trying to convince them that he is the lesser of two evils. So his commercial warn that Mr. Christie would eliminate insurance coverage for mammograms, reject billions in federal aid and drive property taxes — already the nation’s highest — through the roof.Mr. Christie, 47, whose only other elected office was as a Morris County freeholder, has held a healthy lead in the polls for months, remarkable in a state that has not elected a Republican statewide since Christine Todd Whitman was re-elected governor in 1997. Mr. Christie withstood a flurry of tough reports last month that dented his incorruptible image, most notably his admission that he extended a loan to a subordinate in the federal prosecutor’s office and did not report it on his financial disclosure forms or tax returns, as required.But he has come this far by saying little more than that New Jersey is broken and he will fix it, and he appears reluctant to complicate that message with proposals that have price tags. He has vowed to cut spending even if it means titanic conflicts with the Democratic-controlled State Legislature. Speaking to a crowd in Paramus, he vowed to use the line-item veto like someone “standing at the checkout counter declining their credit card.”The final six weeks are unlikely to see a change in tone.Mr. Corzine, a former Goldman Sachs chairman, is prepared to spend upward of $40 million to hold on to the office, and plans to flood the airwaves with TV and radio commercials assailing his Republican challenger as a bogus change agent and a hypocrite with “one set of rules for himself and another for everyone else.”Mr. Christie, whose resources are far more limited, plans to briefly hold his fire, then unleash a barrage of ads reminding voters that change in Trenton begins with hiring a new governor. He also hopes to maximize the impact of two televised debates, where his easy volubility is more than a match for the often tongue-tied governor.Underscoring Mr. Corzine’s shaky standing, the frontlines in the coming weeks may well be in the cities, areas any Democrat would be expected to dominate. Billing himself as a new kind of Republican who can work with the president on issues like education, Mr. Christie has been appealing to blacks and Latinos in urban areas, in hopes of eating into Mr. Corzine’s margins.But the governor and his allies in the teachers’, public workers’ and trade unions are already gearing up for a get-out-the-vote effort that could see record spending and as many as 16,000 canvassers on the streets before Election Day.Harnessing the enthusiasm for Mr. Obama will be a big part of that effort, which is why the governor is grabbing at the president’s lapels like a lifeline. He warns that a defeat in New Jersey could undermine the administration’s agenda in Washington and even presage another Republican comeback like the one in 1994, which came a year after Ms. Whitman unseated a Democratic incumbent.“This election is not about me,” Mr. Corzine told a Latino audience recently. “It’s important for your president. It’s important for your children and your grandchildren.”Still, predicting the role Mr. Obama may personally play in the race is tricky. Mr. Corzine is hoping that the president appears with him in the final days of the campaign for a major rally; the president’s advisers say no decision has been made and are wary of tying Mr. Obama too closely to the governor, in case he loses.“You can bet Obama doesn’t want this to be seen as a referendum on him,” said Stuart Rothenberg, editor of The Rothenberg Political Report. “But he’s going to do everything he can to defend a Democratic office, because win or lose, in politics, people are going to read it how they want.”'"
"'09-09-25,'0','TOKYO (Reuters) — Japan Airlines pleaded on Thursday for a government bailout, but the new transport minister withheld support on concerns that the carrier’s cost-cutting plans would not go far enough.The request by the chief executive of Japan Airlines, Haruka Nishimatsu, for a capital injection from the state came as the carrier’s shares tumbled 16 percent to a record, hit by news media reports that lenders might seek to break up the company and that it had asked for a bailout.Japan Airlines, weighed down by $15 billion of debt and headed for its second consecutive annual loss, is being wooed by Delta Air Lines and a rival group led by American Airlines, which are offering capital in return for closer business ties.Japan Airlines has been scrambling to put together a restructuring plan to submit to the government this month, a condition of a state guarantee on a billion-dollar loan earlier this year.The likelihood of further state support has been thrown into doubt by a change in government in August that brought the Democratic Party to power, ending the rule of the Liberal Democratic Party, which had supported state help for the airline.The transport minister, Seiji Maehara, met with Mr. Nishimatsu on Thursday. He reiterated that he did not want the airline to go bankrupt but said he was not ready to approve a request for the state to prop up the carrier by buying shares.'"
"'09-09-25,'0','“The people who’ve been around a long time know him and like him,” said Frank J. Fahrenkopf Jr., who was chairman of the Republican National Committee when Mr. Kirk led the D.N.C. “He has shown that he’s someone who can be trusted, who’s straight.”Paul Grattan Kirk Jr. was born Jan. 18, 1938, in Boston to a family that had risen quickly from Irish immigrant roots. His mother was a niece of Cardinal William O’Connell, a longtime archbishop of Boston, and his father became a justice on the state’s Supreme Judicial Court.After Harvard and Harvard Law, Mr. Kirk worked for Robert F. Kennedy’s presidential campaign in 1968 and almost quit politics after Mr. Kennedy’s assassination.But when Edward Kennedy told him “he had a responsibility to fight on,” Senator John Kerry said Thursday, Mr. Kirk went to work for him in 1969, becoming Mr. Kennedy’s chief political strategist and one of his most trusted confidants.Mr. Kirk returned to Boston in 1977 to join the law firm Sullivan & Worcester, but rejoined Mr. Kennedy in 1980, serving as national political director for his unsuccessful presidential campaign. He was elected chairman of the D.N.C. in 1985, with crucial support from Mr. Kennedy and his allies in organized labor, a time when the Democratic Party was reeling from Ronald Reagan’s second presidential win and fraught with internal turmoil.Mr. Kirk had a victory in the 1986 midterm elections, when the Democrats recaptured control of the Senate after six years, but he also witnessed the harsh defeat of Michael S. Dukakis to President George Bush in 1988. He chose not to seek a second term, returning instead to private law practice in Boston.In the late 1990s, he did lobbying work for the pharmaceuticals Hoechst Marion Roussel and Aventis, which led critics to question Thursday whether his voting on health care legislation could be a conflict of interest. More recently, Mr. Kirk has served on the board of Hartford Financial Services Group, an insurer, earning more than $250,000 in salary and stock options last year.“It’s going to be a continual public appearance of a conflict of interest,” said Craig Holman of Public Citizen, a nonpartisan watchdog group in Washington, “even if Paul Kirk is virtuous enough to not care how it impacts his own finances.”Mr. Kirk said Thursday that he was resigning from the Hartford board immediately, and several ethics lawyers said he would not be violating Senate rules by voting on the health care legislation.He lives on Cape Cod with his wife, Gail, whom he met when both worked for Mr. Kennedy. Friends say that entering a relationship with her might be the only rule Mr. Kirk ever broke, because the senator forbade his employees from dating. The couple never had children.Mr. Kirk is close to Caroline Kennedy, with whom he has worked closely for years as chairman of the board of the John F. Kennedy Memorial Library.“You know everything is going to go great if Paul is there,” Ms. Kennedy said Thursday in an interview, adding that he often nudged the foundation’s awards committee to consensus when it chose recipients for the annual Profile in Courage Award. “He’s an amazing listener. And it’s all about the work for him, not the credit.”She described Mr. Kirk as “somewhat reserved,” and Mr. Meade concurred, saying, “I don’t think he’ll have a lot of press conferences.”A passionate sports fan, Mr. Kirk at one point hoped to be named baseball or football commissioner, Mr. Fahrenkopf said. He also helped negotiate a deal to keep the New England Patriots from decamping to Hartford in the late 1990s.Mr. Kirk considered running for governor in 1990 but decided against it, partly because Joseph Kennedy II, Senator Kennedy’s nephew, was also considering a run. He did not consider seeking public office again, friends said. He is to be sworn in Friday on Capitol Hill.“Once you observe the trials and tribulations of running for office and being in office up close,” said James Flug, another longtime Kennedy adviser, “it takes a certain kind of person to want to do it. I think Paul was happy with his life.”'"
"'09-09-25,'0','PITTSBURGH — For the record, no, the White House was not snubbing Prime Minister Gordon Brown of Britain. Such a thought is “silly and absurd,” the White House spokesman, Robert Gibbs, said Thursday.The United States still has a special relationship with Britain, he said. The only reason the White House turned down five requests from the British for a meeting between President Obama and Mr. Brown this week is that they talk all the time, he said.“Stop reading those London tabloids,” Mr. Gibbs said, swatting down the fuming by the British news media that the prime minister was being disrespected by the Obama administration.Of course, these are the same media that got all huffy when Mr. Obama gave Mr. Brown some DVDs of American movies last spring when the prime minister visited Washington. Mr. Brown had given Mr. Obama what the British newspapers decided was a much more thoughtful gift, a penholder made from the wood of a Victorian anti-slavery ship.So it was no surprise that when the British newspapers got wind of Mr. Obama’s planned meetings in New York with President Dmitri A. Medvedev of Russia, President Hu Jintao of China and Japan’s new prime minister, Yukio Hatoyama, they went into overdrive.“Barack Obama Snubs Gordon Brown Over Private Talks,” read the headline in The Guardian.The Guardian reported that the White House had been annoyed at Britain for weeks, ever since the Scottish government decided to release the only man convicted of the Lockerbie bombing, Abdel Basset Ali al-Megrahi, because he was terminally ill with prostate cancer.'"
"'09-09-25,'0','A lot of people think a root cause of the problem was the conflict of interest created by the fact the agencies were paid by the creators of those products, and therefore were dependent on their good will for additional business.But regulators are unwilling to outlaw the old system, in part because that would leave investors without access to ratings unless they paid for them. So the solution chosen by the S.E.C. is to encourage other rating agencies to rate the products.The rule adopted last week says that whatever information is given to the agency hired by the issuer to rate the structured finance security must be given to other rating agencies, including those that provide analyses only to investors who pay for them.The result will be that analysts for the other rating agencies, like Egan-Jones Ratings, will have access to information not available to the general public, and their analyses will go only to clients. Those clients will have the benefit of nonpublic information, or at least of their agent’s analysis of what it means.The answer is obvious: Cut off the inside information. The rating agencies now have an exemption from the S.E.C.’s Regulation FD, for fair disclosure. If that exemption were removed, the level playing field would be restored. And the respect that ratings now get from people who assume the raters know more than they do would fade away.There could be temporary exceptions, to allow companies to tell the raters of plans not yet announced — like a takeover — so that the rating agencies could issue their opinions as soon as the announcement is made. But when they did issue the ratings, whatever information the agencies were given would also have to be made public.Instead of ending the exemption for rating agencies, the S.E.C. broadened it to include agencies that are newly able to demand the information.“The commission believes it is important to foster competition among rating agencies to improve the quality of ratings services, particularly among those providing ratings of structured finance products, and the recently approved rule change is designed to advance that goal,” said Meredith B. Cross, director of the commission’s division of corporation finance. “We are also mindful of concerns about potential misuse of confidential information, and the new rule includes important safeguards to address those concerns.”The safeguards include getting the analysts to promise not to disclose the inside information. But the commission did not, and could not, demand that the analysts not use the information in assessing the security. That is the whole point of the new rule.One argument against making some of that information public is one of confidentiality. The owner of an office building whose mortgage was included in a mortgage-backed security would not like competitors to see his rent roll. But summary data could be developed, and, in any case, public companies have been able to live — and compete aggressively — while making the considerable disclosures required by securities laws.Sean Egan, managing director of Egan-Jones Ratings, is likely to benefit from the new rule. Not only would he be able to get the information to rate whatever he wanted to rate, but he would have an advantage over other securities analysis firms because he would have access to information they did not have.It is, he told me this week, an advantage he does not want. “My argument is that there should be no carve-out for ratings firms,” he said. “Why should they be given privileged information?”He speculated on what would happen if, say, Goldman Sachs asked that its analysts be allowed to get inside information from companies that was not made available to analysts from Merrill Lynch or Morgan Stanley. The S.E.C. would laugh at such a request.The new rule letting other rating agencies get the information does not apply to corporate and municipal securities, only to structured finance. While it is certainly true that the biggest ratings disasters came in structured finance, there have been some ratings failures elsewhere. It would make more sense to open all the markets, and let everyone have access to the same information.Rating agencies came to enjoy privileged status for a variety of reasons. They seemed to be almost like utilities, and regulators came to rely on ratings to provide easy comparability in a complex world. Bank regulators allowed banks to carry less capital against AAA-rated securities. The S.E.C. specified that most assets in money market funds had to be held in highly rated securities.The S.E.C. has repealed some of those rules, and is considering whether to part with others. Bank regulators are working on capital rules. But there remains great demand for that simplicity.So long as ratings were more or less freely disseminated to all, letting the agencies have access to information not available to others seemed to do no harm. In fact, it may have done harm by providing added credibility to ratings issued by agencies that, no matter how good their intentions, suffered from a fundamental conflict of interest in that they could get the information only if the company being rated chose to hire them.But there is, in reality, little difference between what a credit rating analyst should do and what a securities analyst should do, particularly for debt securities. There are thousands of securities analysts, many of them seeking to sell their services to institutional investors. It makes no sense to give Egan-Jones, or any other analysis firm, a competitive advantage simply because it chooses to register as a credit rating agency.There would be another advantage to a rule that said rating agencies got the same information as other analysts. Money managers who lost a lot of their clients’ money in collateralized debt obligations and other funny pieces of paper have been able to blame the rating agencies for misleading them, and thus try to escape responsibility.In fact, those managers had the obligation to understand what they were buying. The management fees they were collecting should have covered more work than checking out what Moody’s had to say.In a world where it was clear that Standard & Poor’s had the same information as everyone else, it would be a lot easier for the rest of us to weigh the wisdom of a given rating. The prestige of a Fitch rating would depend on its reputation for superior insight and analysis, not on its access to confidential information.'"
"'09-09-25,'0','“Fathers & Sons,” a new play by Richard Hoehler, wears its heart on its sleeve. And on its lapel. And on its cuffs, collar and trousers too. The story is so sentimental and good-natured that its warmth often stifles what is otherwise a well-conceived show.In the play, at the Lion Theater, Richard (Mr. Hoehler) and Edwin (Edwin Matos Jr.) portray two actors rehearsing a script that examines relationships between fathers and sons, or father figures and their surrogate sons. Throughout the show’s 90 minutes, Richard and Edwin alternately wade into scenes from their rehearsal, then jump out to deal with personal problems. Their on- and offstage lives come to mirror each other, and over the course of the action secrets are unearthed, confessions are made and kindness is frequently just a few lines away.While the device of a play within a play is hardly innovative, it is effectively employed here; both Mr. Hoehler and Mr. Matos work hard in pulling off quick scene and character changes. Mr. Matos is given the widest range of emotions to work with, and he capably uses the opportunities. The men are aided by Michael Abrams’s lighting, which dexterously sets the scenes, as well as the scenes within those scenes.Yet the script, by Mr. Hoehler, routinely relies on dialogue more attuned to an “After-School Special.” “Don’t run away from your feelins’ like I did” and “You think you know who I am but you don’t” are among the lines the characters fall back on instead of pushing forward into riskier territory. Certainly not every play needs to be cynical or acerbic. But a greater variety of tone would not be unwelcome here.Overall Mr. Hoehler has written a likable melodrama that is pleasant on its surface, though it is uninterested in exploring the “austere and lonely” brand of fatherly love that the poet Robert Hayden once described. For the characters in “Fathers & Sons,” affection is usually nearby and forgiveness is often close at hand. Depending on how you like your theater, that could be construed as a flawed view of life, or as a vision of a better world.'"
"'09-09-25,'0','Mr. Thompson and other analysts said that with the defense budget peaking, the stakes were so high that both of the potential bidders, and their supporters in Congress, would keep battling for an edge before the final request for bids was released early next year.The Air Force is expected to award the contract, for 179 tankers, next summer. The contract could be extended for decades and eventually cost $100 billion for 400 to 500 of the planes.In evaluating the new bids, the Air Force said it would consider more than just the initial price of the planes. Ashton B. Carter, the Pentagon’s top acquisition official, said the planes would have to meet 373 requirements, and the price of each plane would be adjusted to reflect how much it would cost to operate over 40 years and how well it would meet various war-fighting needs.After the adjustments are made, he said, one side would win if the projected cost of its plane was more than 1 percent less than its rival’s. If the difference in costs was judged to be less than 1 percent, the plane with the highest score on 93 additional features would be the winner, Mr. Carter said.Representative Norman D. Dicks, Democrat of Washington and a Boeing supporter, said that the proposed rules sounded “a lot better than in the last go-around.”But Mr. Dicks and other Boeing supporters were upset that the Pentagon, as expected, decided to exclude any consideration of a preliminary trade ruling that Airbus had received illegal subsidies for its planes. Pentagon officials said that trade fight could drag on for years before being resolved.Military analysts said that decision was a boon for Northrop Grumman and EADS. They said that team could also gain in some areas if it once again offered a larger plane, based on the Airbus A330 jetliner, than Boeing.But they also said that Boeing could benefit from having much lower projected fuel and maintenance costs if it stuck with a variation of the midsize 767 that it offered last time.Though the Air Force had sought a midsize plane in the last competition, Northrop Grumman and EADS initially won by offering the larger plane at a much lower initial price.So analysts said that a crucial question in the new bidding could be whether a smaller Boeing plane would save enough over the long term in fuel and other costs to offset the cheaper initial price that Northrop Grumman and EADS might offer.Pentagon officials said the shift to a fixed-price contract reflects the administration’s efforts to tighten government contracting. But analysts say political considerations are also likely to weigh on the final decision.Boeing, which would build its planes in Washington and add final parts in Kansas, has strong support from both of those Congressional delegations and from big labor unions that supported Mr. Obama. Northrop Grumman and EADS have champions in Alabama, where they said they would build a plant to finish assembling the Airbus tankers.And while the Pentagon has “made a good-faith effort to wring out the ambiguities,” said Representative Neil Abercrombie, Democrat of Hawaii, who chairs a House military subcommittee, “in the end, they still have to make some judgment calls about what they want most.”'"
"'09-09-25,'0','WASHINGTON (AP) — Paul A. Volcker, a top White House economic adviser, said Thursday that the Obama administration’s proposed overhaul of financial rules would preserve the policy of “too big to fail” and could lead to future banking bailouts.Mr. Volcker, a former Federal Reserve chairman, told Congress that by designating some companies as critical to the broader financial system, the administration’s plans would create an expectation that those companies enjoy government backing in tough times. That implies those financial companies “will be sheltered by access to a federal safety net,” he said.He urged lawmakers to make clear that nonbank companies would not be saved with federal money.Emergency measures by the Fed, Treasury and Congress during last year’s financial crisis created the expectation that the government would step in to protect failing companies, their bond holders and stockholders, Mr. Volcker said at a hearing of the House Financial Services Committee.Mr. Volcker said he did not differ with the administration on most of its proposals and that he took “as a given” that banks would be bailed out in times of crisis.But he said he opposed bailouts of insurance companies like the American International Group, the automakers’ finance arms and others.“The safety net has been extended outside the banking system,” Mr. Volcker said. “That’s what I want to change.” He said the administration’s proposal to create a new system for winding down large nonbank companies would make that easier.'"
"'09-09-25,'0','EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. — Pointing a finger toward the audience surrounding U2 on Wednesday night at Giants Stadium, Bono sang, “Oh, you look so beautiful!” — with the crowd itself shouting along. It was just one moment of mutual affirmation in a concert with an ever-expanding mission.U2 kept raising the metaphysical ante. At first the show was about the band itself and its joy in the music it has been making for more than 30 years together. The set began with “Breathe,” a song from U2’s current album, “No Line on the Horizon” (Interscope) that declares, “I’ve found grace inside a sound.”Soon it turned from musical ambition to rock community-building, bonding the band and the fans who had sold out the stadium. Being in New Jersey on Bruce Springsteen’s 60th birthday, U2 segued Mr. Springsteen’s “She’s the One’ (with Bono changing the chorus to “He’s the one”) into its own “Desire.”Then that local gathering was placed in the wider world and urged toward activism. “Walk On” was dedicated to Aung San Suu Kyi, the opposition leader and Nobel Peace Prize laureate who has long been under house arrest in Myanmar, and dozens of her supporters paraded onstage with her photograph.Finally, this world became part of the universe and a spiritual realm with songs, as Bono used “Amazing Grace” to lead into U2’s “Where the Streets Have No Name.” The concert was high-minded and earthy, exalted and playful, sometimes even goofy, wielding rock-star prerogatives while undercutting them with disarming informality. “We’re very humbled,” Bono said to one wave of applause, and smiled. “Well, maybe not.”It was the first local stop of U2’s 360 Degree tour, which is played in the round under a claw-like, spired structure that’s part insect, part spacecraft, part cathedral. It’s less imposing than it appears in photographs; the scalloped exostructure is stretchy plastic, not metal. But it serves its purpose: keeping the band visible and staying out of its way better than some of U2’s past stadium contraptions.'"

"'09-09-26,'0','A global ban on medium-range missiles would be more effective if it is complemented by two measures. First, restraints on countries that would not immediately sign a medium-range missile ban can be instituted through a flight-test ban that prohibits testing of new missiles. Such a ban would thwart countries from developing new missiles, especially multiple-stage medium-range and long-range missiles.Second, countries could develop missiles by declaring them to be satellite-launching rockets. A space service regime can overcome this drawback. Under such a regime, states would renounce building space rockets, and their satellites would be launched by a consortium of existing space-faring states.

This is not speech.

"'09-09-26,'0','The Knicks are counting on continued improvement from David Lee and Nate Robinson, two key players who were finally re-signed on Friday. They are curious about their two first-round draft picks, Jordan Hill and Toney Douglas. They say Wilson Chandler, who had a breakout season, can do even more.“We have a lot of question marks,” D’Antoni said, “and if a few of these question marks can come through, then we’ll have a very good chance.”He meant a chance at making the Eastern Conference playoffs, a task that surely got tougher after several teams made improvements this summer.But the greatest intrigue, and the greatest source of D’Antoni’s optimism, has to do with Gallinari, the 6-foot-10, 225-pound forward from Italy, whom the Knicks chose with the sixth pick in 2008.Gallinari played sparingly last season because of a back injury that required minor surgery. He is said to be completely healthy and looking brilliant in the informal scrimmages that the Knicks have held for the last few weeks.Al Harrington and Robinson will again carry the scoring load, and Lee will be counted on for many more double-doubles. But every time D’Antoni considers what the Knicks could be this season, his thoughts drift back to Gallinari.“He played in 28 games last year at about half speed and we were 14-14,” D’Antoni said. “And he shoots 47 percent from 3s.”Gallinari is also a deft and willing passer with a high basketball I.Q., the kind of player who, the Knicks contend, will make everyone around him better. The Knicks lost 18 games last season by 5 points or fewer; D’Antoni seems certain that a healthy Gallinari could have made a difference in a bunch of them.“He’s got a long ways to go,” D’Antoni said, “so I don’t want to oversell it, which I will always do. But he’ll give us something we didn’t have last year, and that’s perimeter shooting that might be the best in the league.”The Knicks stayed in playoff contention into February last season but lost their way amid a series of injuries and trades, as the team president Donnie Walsh began jettisoning bad contracts. Walsh said he was likely to leave the roster intact this season, which should help the Knicks’ cohesion and chemistry.Still, making the playoffs will require more than a few surprise performances.“We’re going to have to overachieve, without a doubt,” D’Antoni said.Walsh finished his last bit of summer business on Friday, when Robinson and Lee signed one-year contracts. Both were restricted free agents who spent the off-season waiting for lucrative multiyear deals that never materialized. Walsh insisted on one-year contracts to avoid cutting into his 2010 cap space. As a show of good faith, he gave both players more than the Knicks were required to under salary-cap rules. In Lee’s case, he will make at least $7 million — $4.4 million more than the qualifying offer that the Knicks could have insisted on.“We didn’t play the leverage,” Walsh said. “I want them to feel good about playing for the New York Knicks.”Both players will earn large bonuses if the Knicks make the playoffs. In that case, they will all feel pretty good.'"
"'09-09-26,'0','But his one-stroke lead gave hope to a field that will give chase to Woods, who has won 33 of 40 times when holding or sharing the 36-hole lead.Harrington was not waving a white flag, but he was aware of the hill he must climb. Saturday will be the ninth time this year he has been in a weekend pairing with Woods; he has yet to finish higher in an event with Woods, and he has only shot a lower score once.“You know, it’s not good for me,” Harrington said. “It’s out of my control whether I can win the FedEx Cup. It’s hard to see Tiger not finishing in the top two when he’s leading the tournament after 36 holes. I think it’s hard to get your mind around him not winning it after leading after 36 holes.”O’Hair has overtaken Woods this year, though not when Woods was in the lead. At the Quail Hollow Championship in May, O’Hair started the final round three strokes behind the leader Zach Johnson and one behind Woods. O’Hair shot a 69 and won the tournament.“That was probably the biggest moment for me in golf was winning at such — number one, at such a great golf course that all the players love,” O’Hair said, “and two, with such a great field.”But as far as giving him any better chance of overtaking Woods to win the FedEx Cup playoffs, with a $10 million bonus and the Tour Championship’s $1.35 million first-place check at stake?“My game plan is just to go out there this weekend with a game plan and execute it, and if I do that, that’s all I can do,” O’Hair said. “You know, I can’t control Tiger from shooting a 62 tomorrow or whatever.”When someone suggested it would be nice for O’Hair if he could exercise some control over Woods, he flashed a smile.“It would be nice,” he said. “I think the only way for me to do it is to take a baseball bat to his knee, but I don’t think he’d like that too much.”There is no danger of a Tonya Harding-Nancy Kerrigan incident breaking out over the weekend, but some golfers may kick themselves over what could have been. Phil Mickelson would be two strokes off the pace if he had made a bogey rather than a quadruple-bogey 8 at the 14th hole on Thursday. Instead, after shooting a 67 on Friday, he was at even par, five strokes back, but still hopeful.“If I can get a hot round on Saturday,” Mickelson said, “I’ll have a chance on Sunday.”Stewart Cink, who has had a membership at East Lake since 1993, could not take advantage of his local knowledge after moving into a tie for the lead with Woods halfway through Friday’s round. Cink birdied the ninth hole to get to five under and tie Woods, but then hit two tee shots out of bounds at No. 10 en route to a quadruple bogey. He shot a 72 and is one under, four shots behind Woods.Still, it could have been worse. Woods hit a 246-yard uphill shot with a fairway wood to within five feet of the hole at No. 15 but missed the eagle putt. He whipped his approach at the 481-yard 16th from 165 yards to within five feet again but missed that putt, too. It was a reprieve for the field. Had he made those putts, he would be three strokes ahead.By missing them, he left the field a glimmer of hope.'"

"'09-09-26,'0','“We’re a functional dysfunctional team, and I’m not saying that in a bad sense,” Mahorn said Monday morning in his office at the Palace at Auburn Hills. “We don’t take anything personal. If someone has a gripe or a grievance, O.K., we’ll listen, then we move onward and upward.”It was Mahorn’s 51st birthday, and he was punching the keyboards of two laptop computers while listening to Motown music that was loud enough to knock the sleep from his eyes. The video coordinator, Paige Jackson, stuck her head in to let Mahorn know the players had chipped in to buy him a lemon cake with lemon icing. He dismissed her with a few coarse comments that made her laugh.When Mahorn is cracking jokes, you can see a space between his front teeth but no discernible gender gap. He uses the same profane language with everyone. The team manager responded with a few crude comments of her own, smiled and walked away. Mahorn called her back, and turning serious, pointed to one of the computers and said, “What’s the password?”Mahorn initially was not keen on coaching women, assuming it would be like refereeing a season-long catfight.“It’s a tough knock,” said Mahorn, who turned down Bill Laimbeer, a former Pistons teammate who was then the coach, more than once before finally agreeing in 2005 to coach the Shock’s frontcourt players.He was promoted in June, three games — and two losses — into the season when Laimbeer stepped down to chase an N.B.A. job. (He found one as a Minnesota Timberwolves assistant.)Now, Mahorn said, he sometimes sits back and watches the veteran guard Deanna Nolan, “and I start laughing that I’m getting an opportunity to coach a player that gifted.”Nolan, a wiry 30-year-old who grew up in Flint, Mich., less than an hour up I-75 from Auburn Hills, was being taped at the Palace before practice Tuesday when the 6-foot-10 Mahorn burst into the training room. “Congratulations,” he told her, extending his hand. “You’ve been named second team all-W.N.B.A.” He showered her with one of his profane terms of endearment. Nolan beamed.“When he jokes with you, it’s always in some kind of sarcastic manner with a little bit of profanity thrown in,” Nolan said, adding, “That’s his way of getting his point across.”When Mahorn is serious, his players can tell by the tone of his voice. “When he gets a little bass behind it, he means business,” Ford said.Mahorn’s voice was deep when he said of Nolan, who averaged 23.5 points and 4.0 assists in the regular season, “She hasn’t gotten the respect that I think she should get.”Do any Shock players? After practice, they slip into their cars in jerseys drenched in sweat and drive down the hill to the Palace to shower because the locker room at the Pistons’ practice facility is off limits. The Shock’s no-frills existence makes it “more fulfilling” when they succeed, said Mahorn, who was the coach of the Rockford Lightning in the Continental Basketball Association, a men’s professional development league, in 1999 and 2000, then an assistant with the Atlanta Hawks from 2000 to 2002.Mahorn has learned professional athletes are professional athletes, no matter their gender. They are essentially the same, except “women are more detailed,” he said.“When you draw up a play, they’ll go out and execute that play to the nth detail,” he said. “As a coach, it’s very rewarding.”Growing up with two older sisters and raising four daughters with his wife, Donyale, gave Mahorn, a father of six, an understanding of women that cannot be forced or faked. Describing his promotion, Mahorn said, “Bill left, and then I inherited 11 more daughters.”One of those daughters is Ford, the biological child of Karl Malone, an N.B.A. contemporary of Mahorn’s. Working with the low-post players, Mahorn developed a close rapport with Ford, who is finally rounding into form after having knee surgery in the off-season.“I used to go tell him everything,” Ford said of Mahorn, “because he was easy to talk to and I knew I could trust him.” By her own admission, she has never had that kind of relationship with Malone.“But now I feel like it can’t be the way it used to be because he’s the head coach,” said Ford, who is averaging 6.8 points in the playoffs. “He says his door’s always open, but I feel like I have to pick and choose what I choose to tell him because he’s the highest authority. I hold a lot in now.”Mahorn does, too, although he seems as open as the door to his office. He has a quip for everyone he meets and he addresses every employee at the Palace by name (and has a nickname for most).On Mahorn’s birthday, Sept. 21, five women from the cleaning crew came into his office during their morning break to sing “Happy Birthday.” And they weren’t the first. Two security men stationed at the loading dock had already been by to serenade Mahorn, who exchanged good-natured insults with everyone even though on this day his heart was not really into it.His mother, Alice, whom he adored, died in 1993 when she was 57, and the nearer he gets to that age, the more acutely Mahorn feels his mortality.“Everybody loved my mom, and Rick’s a lot like her,” his sister Pam said by telephone. “Since she died, he kind of holds his feelings in a little bit.”Mahorn’s other sister, Audrey, died at 45 seven years ago; last week, her 28-year-old son died of a heart attack. Mahorn traveled to his hometown, Hartford, for his nephew’s funeral, returning home the day before the Shock’s first playoff game.When he felt his blood pressure rising during his halftime rant in New York, Mahorn was scared. He told himself, I’m not going to do that anymore.There’s too much more Mahorn wants to give back to the game and his players to waste a single breath.“I try to have a smile,” he said, “and just keep on going.”'"
"'09-09-26,'0','The 64-board final of the 13th World Computer-Bridge Championship, played in Washington last month, was close throughout. With 16 deals to go, Jack from the Netherlands led Wbridge5 from France by 85 international match points to 79.Wbridge5 closed the gap to 2 imps with five boards to be played. On Board 60 Wbridge5 overbid to a hopeless three no-trump to lose 5 imps. After a flat board, Wbridge5 misdefended to allow a second overtrick in three no-trump. That cost 1 imp — who cares about 1 imp? The margin was 8 imps when the diagramed deal, Board 63, was played.Look at the South hand. You pass, and partner opens one heart. How would you plan the auction?If you knew partner did not have spade support, you would respond one no-trump, planning to rebid in diamonds. But understandably both programs responded one spade. Now, though, over North’s two-club rebid, they were in an awkward position. How do you and your partner treat a two-diamond rebid?If South were not a passed hand, two diamonds would be fourth-suit game-forcing. South would have no good rebid. And although South is a passed hand, many experts still treat it as an artificial one-round force. But both computer programs played it as natural.Jack North then tried for game with two no-trump before respecting his partner’s signoff in three diamonds.Wbridge5 West did well to lead a trump, but Jack South played on spades to bring home an overtrick.At the other table over two diamonds, Wbridge5 North jumped to three no-trump. If Wbridge5 South had been taught that three no-trump ends all auctions, it would have passed. Then, with the aid of two winning minor-suit finesses and a favorable diamond break, that contract would have rolled home, gaining 7 imps for Wbridge5 and leaving the match hanging by 1 imp with one board to go. But Wbridge5 South removed to four diamonds, and Wbridge5 North raised to five diamonds.'"
"'09-09-26,'0','AMSTERDAM (AP) — The consumer products giant Unilever said on Friday that it had agreed to buy soaps and personal care businesses from the Sara Lee Corporation for 1.28 billion euros ($1.88 billion).The businesses to be acquired, subject to regulatory approval, include Sara Lee’s worldwide body care products business and its European detergents arm. The products include the Sanex brand of soap; Duschdas, a German shower gel maker; and several strong regional brands like Radox bubble bath and Switzal, a maker of baby shampoo.Unilever said the businesses it would acquire had sales of 750 million euros and operating earnings of 128 million euros in the 12 months that ended in June.Unilever, the world’s third-largest consumer products company after the Procter & Gamble Company and Nestlé, says its Dove, Axe and Rexona lines will complement the Sara Lee brands.Sara Lee’s chief executive, Brenda Barnes, said her company would use the proceeds to “invest for growth in our core businesses” and to buy back $1 billion of stock.For Sara Lee, the sale is part of a strategy to concentrate on food and beverages and follows its 2006 spinoff of the clothing unit Hanesbrands. Sara Lee said potential buyers had shown “significant interest” in the rest of its household-products businesses, which are also for sale.'"
"'09-09-26,'0','Good morning, Nicolas. Did you sleep well, Angela? Wasn’t that a good dinner last night, Gordon? Pittsburgh is such a great city; I’m so glad we’re holding our G-20 summit here. It was Michelle’s idea, you know. I think she would have lobbied for Pittsburgh even if the city hadn’t swung for me in the election. O.K., maybe not.So let’s get down to business. We made great progress on Thursday, didn’t we? Jintao, you agreed to push for more domestic demand in your Chinese economy. That’s exciting. My good friends in Europe agreed to seek more investment from the rest of the world, and everybody agreed to be less dependent on American consumers. We even agreed to check up on one another to see if we’re all doing what we said we would do.Wow. Are summits always this productive?I didn’t think so. You can stop laughing.Now we’ve got to tackle the subject we’ve all been avoiding. What are we going to do about capital requirements for the banking system? Please, Nicolas, don’t groan. Tim Geithner has convinced me that strengthening capital requirements is the single most important factor to ensure we never repeat last year’s financial crisis. I could never say this in public, but all the fuss over executive compensation is a sideshow compared to strengthening capital requirements.When I was running for president, I barely knew that banks even had capital requirements. I certainly didn’t know the difference between Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital. I thought Basel was a city in Switzerland, and not shorthand for a complex international system to regulate bank capital requirements. But I sure know about them now. They helped create the mess we got into last year. And now, because our banks and most of your banks use different capital standards, it is going to be really tough to get us on the same page. But we have to try.I’m sure you all saw the proposal for tougher capital requirements that Tim and his folks at Treasury issued a few weeks ago. I know you don’t all agree with his proposals, but I think they make a ton of sense. And I am very reluctant to compromise on Tim’s plan because I think it offers the best chance to make sure that the banking system survives the next big financial crisis.For instance, Tim says that the quality of Tier 1 capital has to be vastly improved. Who knew that not all capital is the same? (Tier 2 capital isn’t worth talking about. “It’s the bank equivalent of your brother-in-law saying he’ll lend you $5 if you get in trouble,” somebody told me the other day.)The way Tim explained it to me, the best kind of capital is the kind that is tangible and never has to be paid back  the kind that comes from either issuing stock, or from putting aside retained earnings. That is the kind of capital bankers can use to plug holes when their banks report losses, or when they have to write down assets. But one of the things I’ve learned is that the rules allow other instruments to be classified as Tier 1 “capital.” Preferred stock, for instance. Or hybrid forms of debt. Or even  and I hear you do this a lot in Europe  certain deferred taxes.But when you run into trouble, you can’t use deferred taxes to replace assets that have just been written down. And you can’t use preferred stock either because, ultimately, that money you’ve raised by issuing preferred stock has to be paid back. In other words, it’s not the kind of capital that will act as a safeguard in times of trouble. And that’s the whole point of capital. Besides, potential investors don’t take those forms of capital seriously, so they wind up running in the other direction when things get tough because they don’t trust the bank’s capital.The second thing Tim’s been telling me is that banks need to have more capital. Can anybody really disagree with that? Last year, as banks wrote down their bad loans, their capital levels sank so low that some of them were technically insolvent. Gordon, isn’t that why you now own the Royal Bank of Scotland? It’s why we had to shore up our banks with money from taxpayers  the banks hadn’t put enough capital aside to cover all the losses from their toxic securities.Right now the rules say banks must have, at a minimum, Tier 1 capital that amounts to 4 percent of their assets. Tim hasn’t unveiled a new number yet, but I’ve been hearing 8 percent. I like the sound of that.Tim’s got other good ideas too. He wants banks around the world to have tougher leverage ratios, so they don’t borrow against their assets to the insane degree that Lehman Brothers and others did. And he wants a system that forces banks to increase capital during good times so there will be plenty in reserve for the bad times.What I really like about Tim’s ideas about capital is that even without other reforms, they have the potential to change bank behavior. If a bank wants to be so large that it is too big to fail, it can do so  but it will have to put up much more capital than a smaller competitor. If a bank wants to dabble in derivatives, it will have to pay a price in higher capital requirements. If a bank wants to invest in risky assets  ditto.Banks hate higher capital requirements because they depress profits. So they’ll have to make a choice: risky assets or lower capital requirements. They won’t be able to do both. Oh, and here’s the best part, at least for us: we don’t have to go to Congress to impose new capital requirements. Tim can do it by snapping his fingers tomorrow.'"
"'09-09-26,'0','As in many workplaces, when water cooler talk turns to college football, N.F.L. players, as much as any alumni and perhaps even more, are true to their schools. Many of them decorate their lockers with college mementos.Among little helmets and schedules with photos are shirts, jerseys, pants and jackets in their team colors. Sometimes one player must wear another’s apparel if the team of one player beats the team of another.“It’s all in fun,” cornerback Corey Webster said. “It brings the team closer and closer together. We love that kind of thing.” Webster’s locker is filled with the purple-and-gold of Louisiana State.He is one of the most college-conscious Giants because he grew up near L.S.U. before playing for the Tigers. Webster said he liked to get together with teammates to watch any college game on Thursday nights.Bryan Kehl, a linebacker from Brigham Young, said that, like Webster, he grew up in the vicinity of his college (his family had season tickets), and that makes both of them zealous about bragging rights.“They give me grief every week — win, lose or draw — because I have so much B.Y.U. pride,” Kehl said. Offensive lineman Kevin Boothe said that after Brigham Young beat Oklahoma, Kehl talked about the national title.Then B.Y.U. fell to 2-1 last week with a 54-28 loss to Florida State. “Kehl’s been a little quiet this week, and that’s understandable,” Boothe said. “A lot of guys said B.Y.U. finally played a real team.”Boothe played in the Ivy League at Cornell, which opened last week with a victory against Bucknell. “I can finally get in the conversation,” he said. Of course, that conversation can get edgy.“It’s a running joke,” Boothe said. “Whenever they’re talking about their big-time schools, I kind of stand aside. And then they’ll ask me, ‘Who’s Cornell playing, Yale?’ Jacobs says: ‘One of the nerd schools. Oh, yeah.’ ”Because professional teams draft players from many conferences, regional bias is a factor. Kehl said Justin Tuck, from Notre Dame, has more than one loyalty because he is from Alabama.“Justin was talking about the SEC and he said, ‘We,’ ” Kehl said. “I said, ‘What are you talking about, “We”?’ He said he always reps for the SEC and Alabama.”Shaun O’Hara, the center from Rutgers, said the conversation about college “adds a little excitement.” He added, “There may be some trash-talking as well, and maybe a friendly, or unfriendly, wager on the game.”Madison Hedgecock, the fullback from North Carolina, said, “Well, I don’t have to talk a lot right now because the mighty Tar Heels are undefeated” as they head to Georgia Tech on Saturday.And if his team happens to beat a Giants teammate’s team, Hedgecock said: “You have a little bit of fun. You go back and forth in the training room and say, ‘Man, what happened?’ ”Not every player engages in the banter. Kareem McKenzie, the offensive right tackle from Penn State, said he was more focused on his professional team, but added, “I will stick up for my school and the Big Ten.”McKenzie said one reason for his distance is that he is 30 years old and in his ninth professional season. “I’m far removed from college now,” he said. But Danny Clark, 32, a 10-year veteran from Illinois, still engages.“My team has been doing pretty solid the last few years, but we’re up against the Ohio State University this weekend,” Clark said. “I’ll be tuned in.”Clark said that Southern California Trojans like Terrell Thomas and Steve Smith “talk highly about their institutions” and that Miami players like Sinorice Moss and Bruce Johnson “are very prideful, to say the least.”As Clark spoke, Moss walked by and Clark raised his voice to refer to Miami as “The U.” When Moss heard this, he added a bounce to his stride as he smiled back over his shoulder.Because players travel and hold strategy meetings on Saturdays, their college viewership can be fragmented, but Boothe said the best moment was after evening sessions when the prime-time games were near conclusion.Then, players head to their rooms to turn on the televisions. During bye weeks, players sometimes visit their colleges to see games. And if their colleges play nearby on Thursday nights, they might stop by.It happened last year when Hedgecock and O’Hara attended a clash between the Tar Heels and the Scarlet Knights in Piscataway, N.J. North Carolina won, 44-12. “Hedgecock was on the Rutgers side in the first half, eating the food up on the club level,” O’Hara said. “And then when North Carolina started to take the lead, he went back down on their sideline. So he’s not invited back ever again.”'"
"'09-09-26,'0','There have been no published polls on the race, but his opponent, Tom Barrow, says Detroiters have already grown exasperated with Mr. Bing, who, Mr. Barrow points out, had for years lived in the suburbs before he moved into a Detroit apartment last year.“Detroiters,” said Mr. Barrow, an accountant, “want to get behind somebody who wants to grow the town, not shrink it.”The city’s unions are furious. This month, the local American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, the city’s largest union, announced that it was dropping its endorsement of Mr. Bing’s candidacy, saying it had been misled by his campaign rhetoric.But it is also clear that some people are taking to Mr. Bing’s sober, somber approach at a time when the city’s political landscape (there have been three different mayors in one year) feels as shaky as its economic one. An August primary was deeply lopsided in Mr. Bing’s favor; turnout was low, but Mr. Bing outpaced Mr. Barrow, 74 percent to 11 percent.“I’m with him,” Bobby Mixon, a resident of a Detroit neighborhood riddled with empty and abandoned homes, said of Mr. Bing.Mr. Bing, 65 and a former basketball star who describes himself as “not a politician,” has competed in three elections since February, part of the complicated fallout from the resignation a year ago of , the former mayor who pleaded guilty to criminal charges of obstruction of justice.Outside Detroit, Mr. Bing is doing something Detroit mayors have rarely done: he is drawing praise from the suburban leaders who have long criticized the city and its leadership. On a clear evening recently, Mr. Bing appeared before the board of commissioners in Oakland County, north of Detroit and where Mr. Bing lived until recently. He told commissioners that “Detroit, from a structural standpoint, is broke,” called for regional cooperation and drew a standing ovation.“I think it’s difficult for people to accept the pain that we have to go through,” he said in an interview. “But there is no other way, unless we want to go bankrupt.”Mr. Bing, who founded an auto parts supplier, The Bing Group, in Detroit, is best known for his years as a basketball player with the . People recognize him on the street and stop him for snapshots. Yet his demeanor is not all-star — more mild-mannered, grandfatherly, even at times dull. With his graying hair, glasses, wiry build and deliberate speeches, he seems the antithesis of his predecessor, Mr. Kilpatrick, whose youth, charisma and imposing personal presence always drew a crowd but did not stop Detroit’s slide.So far, Mr. Bing’s biggest trouble has been a minor scandal over misstatements about his educational credentials. But the municipal problems he has inherited are staggering.More than a quarter of the city’s work force is out of work, the highest unemployment since the state began counting such things; mismanagement in the city’s school system has led the state to put it under control of an emergency financial manager; and the city, the mayor says, is on track to run out of money before the end of the year.Crime, long a problem in Detroit, is worse by some calculations than a year ago. Warren C. Evans, whom Mr. Bing appointed as police chief in July, has found that the department “undercounted” crimes in the past. He is trying to make sweeping changes, but admits that the picture, for now, is not desirable.The city’s public schools, which have shrunk to about 90,000 students from more than 160,000 nine years ago, are also undergoing big changes. Robert C. Bobb, the emergency financial manager, has closed schools, laid off employees and begun investigating numerous thefts, the system’s real estate deals and questions about whether scores of people receiving paychecks are really on the payroll.Some 180 computers were stolen from the schools this year alone. “Some individuals are using the schools like shopping malls,” Mr. Bobb said.And the city — with 42 city departments and, the mayor says, some 50 separate bargaining units of unions — is facing an estimated deficit of $275 million, a cold reality that hangs over almost everything the mayor does.On the city’s west side on a recent morning, leaders, including Mr. Bing, appeared at a ribbon-cutting ceremony for a mixed-income development on the site of a former public housing project — a makeover that had taken more than a decade. “Detroit’s New Beginning,” a banner read, near the microphone where Mr. Bing spoke of the “hard decisions” ahead.Two blocks away, on a street with carefully kept homes, other abandoned houses sat empty, doors open, and weeds grew in a playground. Mr. Mixon, 31, gazed at one of the empty homes; it burned down over summer, he said, but the charred remains had never been removed.Mr. Mixon, who grew up here, left and came back, said he would surely leave again after he finished taking computer science classes. “If you are already retired or if you’ve already got a job, I guess you could stay,” he said. “But someone like me has no future in Detroit.”Whether the blunt talk of Mr. Bing, a Democrat, will survive November’s nonpartisan election and ultimately change the perceptions of those like Mr. Mixon is anyone’s guess.Mr. Barrow, who was born in Detroit and long ago unsuccessfully took on Coleman A. Young, the former mayor, said the weeks since Mr. Bing’s victory in the August primary had chipped away at his lead.“He wants to run this like a business, but Detroit’s not a business, it’s a municipality,” said Mr. Barrow, who added that laying off city workers and cutting or privatizing services was not the way to go. “This is a man who thinks people choose to ride the bus as a luxury.”If he is worried about November, though, Mr. Bing does not let on. He does not apologize for his personal wealth, and he has chosen to donate his mayoral salary of $176,000 to the Police Department. He also insists that he is comfortable making the choices ahead of him.“When I look around me and see the hell that everybody is going through,” he said, “I don’t want to sit on the sidelines and lay blame and point fingers and say: ‘That’s not my problem. You fix it.’ ”'"
"'09-09-26,'0','MOSCOW — In the emotional hours after the murder in July of a Chechnya rights campaigner, another prominent rights worker lashed out at the Chechen president, Ramzan A. Kadyrov, accusing him of complicity in her death.Now the rights worker, Oleg P. Orlov, is on trial in Moscow, accused of defamation by Mr. Kadyrov in a lawsuit. On Friday, the first day of the trial, Mr. Orlov stood by his words and added more, accusing Mr. Kadyrov of creating an atmosphere in which Chechen officials, under orders from the president or not, can torture, kidnap and murder with impunity.“The current situation in the Chechen Republic, where horrendous crimes violating human rights go systematically unpunished, has given me every basis for believing in the unconditional political guilt of Ramzan Kadyrov in the death of Natalya Estemirova,” Mr. Orlov, the director of the Russian rights organization Memorial, told the court.Ms. Estemirova, the latest high-profile critic of Mr. Kadyrov to die violently, was kidnapped close to her home in Grozny, Chechnya’s capital, on July 15, driven to a neighboring region and shot.

"'09-09-26,'0','A wealthy UBS private banking client who owns a building material company in New Jersey pleaded guilty on Friday to tax evasion, the latest American caught in a widening investigation into the giant Swiss bank over its offshore services.Juergen Homann, 66, of Saddle River, N.J., pleaded guilty in Federal District Court in Newark to one count of failing to file a special tax form disclosing the foreign assets.Mr. Homann is a dual citizen of the United States and Germany. He pleaded guilty before Judge Stanley R. Chesler in exchange for agreeing to cooperate with a widening investigation into UBS and the law firms, accountants and advisers that prosecutors say helped scores of wealthy American clients of UBS evade taxes through secret private banking services.In court filings, federal prosecutors accused Mr. Homann of deliberately failing to submit a form known as an F-bar in 2007 disclosing his UBS accounts, and of using a foundation in Liechtenstein, a noted tax haven, to conceal the trail. The filings said that Mr. Homann concealed $5 million from United States tax authorities by shifting that amount from his UBS account to a sham corporation, ELM Finance, set up in Hong Kong in 2005.The court papers did not identify Mr. Homann’s private banker at UBS.But they said that Mr. Homann worked with a Swiss lawyer, Matthias Rickenbach, to set up sham corporations overseas to funnel his UBS money to accounts he could then access without alerting the Internal Revenue Service.'"

"'09-09-27,'0','However, the Zazi case seems to have provided an opportunity for some in the F.B.I. to settle old scores and perhaps lobby to close the department’s counterterrorism unit, especially as Commissioner Kelly and Mr. Cohen consider their next steps after nearly eight years in their respective jobs. It should be noted that the F.B.I. has been able to prevent police departments elsewhere in the country from duplicating New York’s operation.What about problems within the department? News reports that the deputy inspector in charge of the investigations unit has now been transferred have led to speculation of friction between that office and the counterterrorism unit. This seems off base. The deputy inspector, Paul Ciorra, who has an outstanding record, was promoted to a coveted command slot in Highway Patrol. He is being succeeded by Joseph Herbert, a highly regarded investigator with years of experience on the joint terrorism task force.Yes, it appears that some detectives might have been too aggressive in pursuing leads in the Zazi case. They apparently showed a photo of Mr. Zazi to a local informant who then tipped off the suspect. This may have contributed to a premature takedown of the cell, and we may not be able to charge some of Mr. Zazi’s confederates. In my judgment, this was an error, but not a big one.The F.B.I. had asked the Police Department to help in finding sources regarding Mr. Zazi, and provided photos and other data for the department to use. As we now know from public documents, Mr. Zazi’s was a serious case. He had been trained in Pakistani terrorist camps and was acquiring precursor chemicals to build improvised bombs similar to those used in the London subway bombing of 2005. The United Nations General Assembly was getting underway as Mr. Zazi drove here from Denver; the Police Department was at its highest level of alert.So, what lessons can we draw from this case regarding the state of our counterterrorism efforts in New York and nationwide? First and most obvious, we must remain vigilant and aggressive in finding domestic terrorist cells.Second, we are reminded that intelligence operations using telephone intercepts and informant networks are the key to foiling Al Qaeda. There are limits to defensive strategies in our major cities: barriers, detection devices and uniformed patrols have their role, but in a sprawling city like New York the only real way to prevent a terrorist attack is to penetrate the cell before it can act.We have apparently thwarted Al Qaeda’s effort to attack us again, one of many such instances over the last eight years. Our domestic investigators must stay focused in their relentless pursuit of terrorist cells in America. Their ability to do their job should not be watered down by lawmakers or their departments.At the same time, the men and women of the New York Police department must be careful to minimize mistakes and to stay clearly within the law when they investigate United States citizens and residents. But given a choice — and there are always choices made every day in this city by investigators on the street — we should err on the side of action, not passivity. Mr. Zazi and his deadly bomb recipes remind us why.There should be no doubt why Mr. Zazi came to New York this month. As we saw with the London subway terrorists, many of whom came from Leeds, a city several hours away from the British capital, terrorists seek out financial, media and population centers when they select their targets. New York City has been and remains squarely in Al Qaeda’s crosshairs. Fortunately, the Police Department and the F.B.I. have built an unparalleled program here that has been up to the challenge so far, and they should both be celebrated, not criticized, for their work in the Zazi case.'"
"'09-09-27,'0','Joseph Gurwin, who at 16 came to America in 1936 with $100 in his pocket, made a fortune and gave much of it away — then fell victim to Bernard L. Madoff, the convicted swindler — died on Thursday in Manhattan. He was 89.His wife, Phyllis, announced the death. He had homes in Manhattan, Southampton and Palm Beach.Mr. Gurwin’s fortune came from manufacturing specialized textiles like bulletproof vests, parachute drop equipment and hoods for gas masks for the military. He made philanthropy into what he called a hobby and dispensed millions to charities in the United States and Israel.From 1988 to 1991, he was chairman of the UJA-Federation of New York, which supports causes that include caring for the aged and Jewish education. He personally contributed to scores of charities, causes and scientific, educational and medical institutions. He helped found the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington.Mr. Gurwin gave major gifts to establish the Rosalind and Joseph Gurwin Jewish Geriatric Center of Long Island in Commack, N.Y., and raised even more money from others to help pay for its 465 beds, 200 assisted-living units and equipment like dental X-ray machines for people in wheelchairs. In Israel, he helped support research at the Weizmann Institute of Science, and in 1990, his contributions to the Technion-Israel Institute of Technology paid much of the cost of launching two satellites, both named after him, in the 1990s.Mr. Gurwin operated under the illusion that his assets were being smartly managed by Mr. Madoff, who was in fact running a Ponzi scheme. He told The Wall Street Journal in 2008 that when he asked Mr. Madoff for a withdrawal, he received the money promptly.'"
"'09-09-27,'0','The commission’s recent actions have piqued the interest of, among others, Senators John McCain and Russ Feingold, the bipartisan pair who teamed up on the 2002 legislation that barred the contribution of so-called soft money to political parties.In one case, the three Republican commissioners — Matthew S. Petersen, Caroline C. Hunter and Donald F. McGahn II — refused to endorse a settlement the commission had reached with a novice Democratic Congressional candidate who had provided inaccurate information about his donors. The commission then reimbursed the campaign, which had already paid a fine.In another, the commissioners deadlocked on whether a Mitt Romney supporter exceeded contribution limits by chartering a plane from Utah to Boston so supporters of Mr. Romney’s presidential bid could attend a fund-raiser. And the three Republican commissioners have also rejected a settlement negotiated by the F.E.C.’s own lawyers with the November Fund, a so-called 527 group financed by the Chamber of Commerce that opposed the Democratic presidential ticket in 2004.Some of the commissioners have also grown more pointed when writing about their colleagues’ rationale. Two Democrats, Cynthia L. Bauerly and Ellen L. Weintraub, wrote that the case involving Arjinderpal Singh Sekhon, the novice candidate, might have had “the most inexplicable resolution” they had seen while on the commission. For their part, the Republicans implied that in the same case the Democratic commissioners — who also include the chairman, Steven T. Walther — had engaged in “rote enforcement of hypertechnical rules.”Fred Wertheimer, the president of Democracy 21, a nonprofit that advocates for campaign finance overhaul, places most of the blame for the deadlocks on the Republican commissioners, saying they “have taken the agency captive.”“Right now, we don’t have an enforcement agency when it comes to campaign finance laws,” added Mr. Wertheimer, who has criticized the commission’s ability to enforce campaign finance regulations for years. “It might as well have been shut down by the Republican commissioners.”More conservative campaign finance experts, however, see little wrong with the commission’s direction.“Reformers are almost always wrong,” said Bradley A. Smith, a former commission chairman who now leads the Center for Competitive Politics. “There’s always a tendency to put the blame on the more deregulatory commissioners. I don’t see that the commission is failing to give advice or enforce the law.”Mr. Franz, the Bowdoin professor, said that he believed the Republican commissioners had played a role in the increased number of deadlocks, but that he did not see the rise in tie votes as a sign that the commission was ineffective.“The ideological fights between Democratic and Republican commissioners are over principles about what the law can and should do,” Mr. Franz said. “It’s a reflection over questions about the scope of the law, which the courts and Congress are also dealing with.”Indeed, the Supreme Court under Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. has taken an increasing deregulatory view of campaign finance. In the recent re-argument of Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission, the chief justice commented that “we don’t put our First Amendment rights in the hands of F.E.C. bureaucrats.” And, following the Supreme Court’s lead, the federal appeals court for the District of Columbia, ruling this month in a case involving the group Emily’s List, loosened election spending restrictions on nonprofits and other independent political groups.Still, the direction of the F.E.C. does seem to have spurred Mr. McCain, an Arizona Republican, and Mr. Feingold, a Wisconsin Democrat, into action.This summer, the two senators revived a proposal that would scrap the commission altogether, instead creating a three-member Federal Election Administration in which no two members could be from the same political party.'"
"'09-09-27,'0','In Milwaukee, Debbie Kransky has been without work since February, when she was laid off from a medical billing position — her second job loss in two years. She has exhausted her unemployment benefits, because her last job lasted for only a month.Indeed, in a perverse quirk of the unemployment system, she would have qualified for continued benefits had she stayed jobless the whole two years, rather than taking a new position this year. But since her latest unemployment claim stemmed from a job that lasted mere weeks, she recently drew her final check of $340.Ms. Kransky, 51, has run through her life savings of roughly $10,000. Her job search has garnered little besides anxiety.“I’ve worked my entire life,” said Ms. Kransky, who lives alone in a one-bedroom apartment. “I’ve got October rent. After that, I don’t know. I’ve never lived month to month my entire life. I’m just so scared, I can’t even put it into words.”Last week, Ms. Kransky was invited to an interview for a clerical job with a health insurance company. She drove her Jeep truck downtown and waited in the lobby of an office building for nearly an hour, but no one showed. Despondent, she drove home, down $10 in gasoline.For years, the economy has been powered by consumers, who borrowed exuberantly against real estate and tapped burgeoning stock portfolios to spend in excess of their incomes. Those sources of easy money have mostly dried up. Consumption is now tempered by saving; optimism has been eclipsed by worry.Meanwhile, some businesses are in a holding pattern as they await the financial consequences of the health care reforms being debated in Washington.Even after companies regain an inclination to expand, they will probably not hire aggressively anytime soon. Experts say that so many businesses have pared back working hours for people on their payrolls, while eliminating temporary workers, that many can increase output simply by increasing the workload on existing employees.“They have tons of room to increase work without hiring a single person,” said Heidi Shierholz, an economist at the Economic Policy Institute Economist. “For people who are out of work, we do not see signs of light at the end of the tunnel.”During the technology bubble of the late 1990s and again this decade, Cisco Systems — which makes Internet equipment — expanded rapidly. As the sense takes hold that the recession has passed, Cisco is again envisioning double-digit rates of sales growth, with plans to move aggressively into new markets, like the business of operating large scale computer data servers.Yet even as Cisco pursues such designs, the company’s chief executive, John T. Chambers, said in an interview Friday that he anticipated “slow hiring,” given concerns about the vigor of growth ahead. “We’ll be doing it selectively,” he said.Two recent surveys of newspaper help-wanted advertisements and of employers’ inclinations to add workers were at their lowest levels on record, noted Andrew Tilton, a Goldman Sachs economist.Job placement companies say their customers are not yet wiling to hire large numbers of temporary workers, usually a precursor to hiring full-timers.“It’s going to take quite some time before we see robust job growth,” said Tig Gilliam, chief executive of Adecco North America, a major job placement and staffing company.During the last recession, in 2001, the number of jobless people reached little more than double the number of full-time job openings, according to the Labor Department data. By the beginning of this year, job seekers outnumbered jobs four-to-one, with the ratio growing ever more lopsided in recent months.Though layoffs have been both severe and prominent, the greatest source of distress is a predilection against hiring by many American businesses. From the beginning of the recession in December 2007 through July of this year, job openings declined 45 percent in the West and the South, 36 percent in the Midwest and 23 percent in the Northeast.Shrinking job opportunities have assailed virtually every industry this year. Since the end of 2008, job openings have diminished 47 percent in manufacturing, 37 percent in construction and 22 percent in retail. Even in education and health services — faster-growing areas in which many unemployed people have trained for new careers — job openings have dropped 21 percent this year. Despite the passage of a stimulus spending package aimed at shoring up state and local coffers, government job openings have diminished 17 percent this year.In the suburbs of Chicago, Vicki Redican, 52, has been unemployed for almost two years, since she lost her $75,000-a-year job as a sales and marketing manager at a plastics company. College-educated, Ms. Redican first sought another management job. More recently, she has tried and failed to land a cashier’s position at a local grocery store, and a barista slot at a Starbucks coffee shop.Substitute teaching assignments once helped her pay the bills. “Now, there are so many people substitute teaching that I can no longer get assignments,” she said.“I’ve learned that I can’t look to tomorrow,” she said. “Every day, I try to do the best I can. I say to myself, ‘I don’t control this process.’ That’s the only way you can look at it. Otherwise, you’d have to go up on the roof and crack your head open.”'"
"'09-09-27,'0','MY life has been punctuated by points where I followed my heart rather than my head. I grew up in Ann Arbor, Mich., and went to the alternative high school there. It was called Community High — Commie High for short — and it had an unstructured format. I spent much of my junior and senior years traveling the country in a six-member jazz ensemble.I went to Brown University and majored in public policy. After graduation, I was told that Senator Bill Bradley had an opening on his staff for a foreign policy specialist who was from New Jersey. I was neither, but took the interview anyway and was able to convince his staff to create a job for me.I worked for him about two years, and what I learned helped me so much in business. In Washington, no matter how complex the issue, you have to boil it down to one page. That’s an invaluable skill for a leader.In 1995, I decided to go to Stanford Business School. After graduating in 1997, I took a job at ADAC Laboratories, a maker of medical equipment. I learned a lot about leadership there — especially how to align a team’s efforts and goals around a common vision.In late 1998, I decided that I really wanted to start my own business. My motivation was partly selfish; I needed an online tool to make it easier to arrange quality time with my friends and family. I quit my job in November 1998 to write a business plan and to start building the product. Everyone thought I was insane. I had no idea what I was doing. I was very “unstealth” about it, telling everyone my idea.The idea became a business called Evite. I was fortunate to meet talented co-founders (who already had the brand and some early technology when I found them). We launched the product, and it took off. In 2001, my partners and I sold the company to Barry Diller.'"
"'09-09-27,'0','“I was getting these text messages from my friends saying: ‘Where are you?’ We got a cold one for you,’ ” he recalled over lunch at a local fast-food chain called Runza. “I just wrote them back and said, ‘Nah, you guys drink it.’ ”The question now is whether that order for 225 towers will be scaled back or canceled. If it’s canceled, Katana Summit won’t operate at even a fraction of full capacity anytime soon and won’t need Charles Salak and his co-workers for the foreseeable future — if, indeed, it ever needs them again.It is early September, and Mr. Salak and Mr. Strudthoff — the semiterminated and the semiterminator — are living parallel lives. Neither of these men is idle, but each is living in that awkward, immiserating limbo where it’s clear, or maybe just clearer than usual, that your future and financial well-being are determined by forces beyond your control.That limbo is arguably the quintessential American experience of the moment. When the Great Recession is dissected into its component parts, this might be remembered as the Waiting Phase. It’s not as scary as the Plummeting Phase of last year, or as event-filled as the To-the-Ramparts Phase of several months ago, but that doesn’t make it any easier.A real recovery, we have heard time and again, won’t begin in earnest until the jobless rate, now at a 26-year high of 9.7 percent, starts to fall. But what will it take for the rehiring to start? What do companies like Katana need to see before they call back people like Charles Salak?What, in other words, are we waiting for?Every company has a different answer, because every company is linked to a different piece of the Rube Goldberg contraption that is our economy. In the case of Mr. Salak and Katana, the wait is connected to a broad array of factors: the flow of credit, green power initiatives, dozens of small and large choices in the hands of people who live far from here.Ultimately, though, the wait at Katana boils down to a phone call. Under terms of the deal, the turbine maker had until the close of business on Sept. 25 — last Friday — to decide whether to scale back its order or walk away from it altogether.Stop or go. Wait or get back to work. At the time of this visit to Columbus, nobody knew what would happen.“I hope they call us early in the day,” said Mr. Strudthoff a couple of weeks back. “That would be courteous.”COLUMBUS, a city of 21,000, has the highest per-capita rate of manufacturing employment of any place in Nebraska. It produces car seats, burger patties, ethanol, bug traps, dog kennels, grain tubs — the list goes on. A handful of Fortune 500 companies have a presence here.With so much manufacturing concentrated in such a small place, Columbus is a laboratory of blue-collar capitalism that, until recently, was remarkably efficient at putting people to work. Jobs were so plentiful that the local Chamber of Commerce sent representatives to towns in Iowa and Michigan where factories were closing, hoping to persuade families to relocate. The local unemployment rate was typically just over 4 percent.For decades, civic leaders courted manufacturers with publicly owned land set aside for factories, with a support structure for industrial repairs and with a work force that, like much of Nebraska’s, is not unionized. Manufacturers knew that they would have ample latitude in hiring, firing and overseeing their employees, because labor organizers gave up on Columbus long ago.“I think of it as the most anti-union town on the planet,” says Ken Mass, the president of the Nebraska A.F.L.-C.I.O. “Back in the late ’70s, early ’80s, the Machinists International Union went there, handbilling, getting their name out. A patrolman just told them to leave.”Subsequent union organizing efforts, he says, caused companies to threaten to relocate — and that was the end of that.The management-friendly atmosphere has lured lots of corporations, which in turn lured people like Mr. Salak, who was raised in Arizona and has relatives in Schuyler, a nearby town. The deal was: Manufacturers could make the rules largely as they saw fit, and in return workers got steady jobs in a place where it was relatively cheap to live.A sign about 17 miles outside of town says “Columbus Is Open for Business,” and the more time you spend here, the more literal those words sound.You can see management’s unfettered hand in the vaguely Dickensian hours that many here work, and you sense an emphasis on unfettered growth in the just-build-it ethos that governs the stretch of strip malls on the road that bisects the town. It’s fast food, a Wal-Mart, a J. C. Penney, check-cashing outlets and dozens of other stores. The traffic to this generic stretch has come at the apparent expense of a fading but picturesque downtown — a Hopper-esque setting, with a railroad station, some gorgeous early 20th century buildings and a former opera house that is now a minimall.But Columbus is a place with affordable homes, newly renovated schools and very little crime. It has a small-town, rural Midwestern feel but has always been expanding enough to be vital and robust. Layoffs aside, there is very little turnover in the work force at the plants here — and a major reason is that people like their jobs and like their town.“This is a community,” says Mr. Salak, “with a lot of down-to-earth people.”Columbus rarely makes national news, though it did in 1997, when a Hudson Foods plant here recalled 25 million pounds of beef, then the largest recall in United States history, in an outbreak of E. coli. (The plant was subsequently sold and is now owned by Cargill.) For the most part, this place hums quietly along.Or it used to. Columbus was all but immune to the recession’s effects for months after it was upending communities around the country.“We kind of lag the coasts,” says Mike Moser, the town’s mayor, who also owns a musical instrument store. “We don’t have the highs that you see in other parts of the county, and we don’t have the lows. But we’re feeling it now.”ONE of the first places with a recession tremor was the Behlen Manufacturing Company, which makes dozens of farm products, as well as one-story steel buildings. Behlen is the granddaddy of Columbus industry, and in a warren of offices beside its factory floor, the company’s history is told in photographs, including an image of one of its steel huts, which was used to test the effects of the first nuclear bomb when it was detonated in New Mexico in 1945.By January of this year, orders for the building segment of the business had all but dried up. Behlen tried a number of strategies to cut costs, including layoffs, and eventually the company shed about 200 of its 1,050 jobs. The executives said they hoped to rehire many of those who left as soon as the phones started ringing again.Among those laid off was Heather Ziemba, a shy 30-year-old with light blonde hair. She started three years ago at Behlen, working a computer-operated lathe on the factory floor, and then had a desk job, coordinating orders.She sat one afternoon on a bench outside Workforce Development, a place she visits once a week to comb through new job listings. She had just returned from an interview with a newly opened hotel looking for an assistant manager.“They offered me the job, but at $8 an hour,” she says, a little exasperated. That’s about what she earns from unemployment checks. And by her calculations, given her expenses — which include raising five children — it isn’t enough. She told the hotel that she would consider $9 an hour. The hotel said no.This the ninth month of Ms. Ziemba’s wait, the longest spell of unemployment she has endured since she started working at age 15, commuting to Columbus from her parents’ home 30 miles away to work at a medical device plant. By 17, she had moved to town, and by 19 she had her first child.The man she is now with brought one child to the relationship, and together the couple have had three more. They are engaged but there are no plans for a wedding.“He’s the sixth child,” she says with a tight grin.Ms. Ziemba has been attending Central Community College, part time, for the last two years, and this summer she received a degree in business administration. It was supposed to be a ticket to a different pay scale, but her expectations have been trimmed. Her latest plan is to earn enough credits online, through a college in Omaha, to parlay her C.C.C. diploma into an undergraduate degree. But that will cost at least $10,000. It’s the kind of expense that a handful of the more generous employers in Columbus help cover — Behlen among them.It’s one more reason Ms. Ziemba misses the place. She has always been fond of the Raimondos, the family that owns and runs the business. There is Tony Sr. — known as T. R. — and his sons, Tony Jr. and Phil.“You could have a real conversation with them,” she says. “And initially, when my job was eliminated, they said, ‘Don’t worry, we’ll find you something else out on the floor.’ Then a whole month went by and they didn’t say anything. Then one of them said to me, ‘Did you decide what you’re going to do?’ I thought, ‘Did you think somebody would take care of this problem for you, because nobody talked to me about it.’ ”TONY JR. is offering a golf cart tour of the Behlen factory floor. It is 850,000 square feet, large enough for 17 football fields.You think of a place like this as a hive of loud and well-coordinated action, but little is happening here. It is like driving into a city that is under a hurricane watch, with just a few stragglers left behind. Every minute or two, you come upon a couple of guys who are galvanizing metal or fabricating tubing. Mostly, it’s quiet.“We’re hopeful,” says Tony Jr., driving past an unused Wiedematic steel punching machine. “But it’s really strange to see it like this. The other day I looked through this window in a door to the factory floor and it was dark. During second shift.”What are the Raimondos looking for as a first sign that it might be time to start rehiring?Orders from hobby farmers, says T. R., sitting in his office and looking through the latest numbers. Behlen is a huge seller to Tractor Supply, a retailer beloved by both professional and amateur farmers. The amateurs tend to be fairly wealthy, white-collar types, with a couple acres of crops, some livestock and horses.The first sign of a pulse will come from them, with orders for horse stalls, dog kennels and watering tanks. “That’s our lead indicator,” T. R. says.Before the recession, the company sold $1.8 million a week in its Behlen Country division, which includes hobby farmer sales. That fell to $1.2 million a few months ago.“I just read in our sales figures that it’s up to $1.5 million for the week,” T. R. says. “That’s the best in several months. Now, will it sustain that pace? We need a little time to find out.”Ms. Ziemba would go back to her former job if the Raimondos called tomorrow. For Charles Salak, it’s more complicated.Part of it is pride. Being laid off temporarily, it turns out, is like getting the heave-ho from a girlfriend who might like to get back together, at some point. But not now, and maybe never.It kind of makes you feel dangled.“I’m leery of them calling me, and I can’t put my finger on it,” says Mr. Salak, who is wearing a shirt with the words “Katana Summit” embroidered on it. “I guess it’s because we poured our heart and soul into this company and they turned around and said, ‘Sorry, we don’t need your assistance until further notice.’ ”With his thick arms and loud laugh, Mr. Salak is the kind of guy you would pick first if you were in charge of a tug-of-war team. You would probably win and you would certainly have a good time. The day we met at Runza, he had just come from Katana, the first time he had been back. He and others were asked to swing by and sign up with a new health insurer the company had hired.It was the one perquisite they kept — health insurance. It was a gesture intended to say, “We’re serious about hiring you back,” and it was supposed to prevent these sort-of ex-employees from taking another job.It makes sense for Katana, which would need to spend weeks and a lot of money bringing a new crew up to speed if and when orders pick up. But for Mr. Salak and others, the benefit comes with a cost. The state offers plenty of retraining programs, but won’t spend money on someone who is “attached” with a company. Mr. Salak would like to learn more sophisticated, better-paying welding techniques, but the programs on offer are not available to him on the state’s dime.As for his own savings, well, he is running low on dimes: “I’m approaching mac-and-cheese broke, as Jeff Foxworthy would say.”Later that evening, Mr. Salak is back in his home, with his wife, Lisa, and their three children. The 4-year-old twins, Riley and Lacey, take turns leaping from the sofa onto their father’s back. A pair of poodles, Shadow and Chewy, take turns barking.Mr. Salak, now in a different “Katana Summit” shirt, walks outside of the three-bedroom house to show off the home improvement projects that have kept him busy in recent weeks — new gutters, as well as a ramp for his mother, who has multiple sclerosis. Occasionally, he will work with a relative who owns a farm, repairing equipment.“I’m not the sort of guy who can just sit around,” he says. “I could watch Nascar all day, but I’d go crazy if I did that.”His wife, fortunately, has a job in town, at BD Medical, where she operates a machine that makes glass syringes. Her shift starts at 6 a.m. and ends at 6 p.m, with a half-hour for lunch and one 15-minute break. She works three of these 12-hour days one week, then four the next.She would love to move to a shift of 8 a.m to 4 p.m., five days a week, but those openings rarely come up, and if one did, there are dozens of people at BD Medical who trump her 10 years of seniority. On days off, she cooks meals that her husband can microwave for the children, because she is at work when they want to eat.As for vacation, “I’ve got to save up those days, so that I can stay home when one of my kids gets sick,” she says.For now, the Salaks have no intention of moving to another town, mostly because they like Columbus. And for all his pique about Katana, Mr. Salak, when pressed, says he’d probably return to work if the company called. He’s just tired of waiting for his phone to ring.THIS might be of little comfort for Mr. Salak, but the man who laid him off is tired of waiting for the phone to ring, too.Kevin Strudthoff has been visiting potential customers for weeks, seeking more wind-tower orders. There have been nibbles. One client is coming by for the plant for a “quality audit.” Another is expected to place an order soon, but nothing firm yet.Obviously, neither he nor his colleagues predicted anything like the disaster that befell the economy. Midway through 2008, Katana was so bullish that it spent $5 million doubling the size of its Columbus plant. And it has always paid its employees about 25 to 50 cents an hour more than most companies in town, Mr. Strudthoff says, a premium large enough for other Columbus C.E.O.’s to razz him about it in social settings.But he thinks wind power is a good long-term bet, and he sees Katana’s current travails as a problem that will pass soon enough. Exactly how soon is still unknown. As of Friday evening, the fate of that order for 225 towers was up in the air. “Unfortunately,” Mr. Strudthoff wrote by e-mail, “we’re still waiting.”'"
"'09-09-27,'0','AS the Woodstock Film Festival celebrates its 10th anniversary this week, it plans, as usual, to recall the music festival of 1969 that gave it its name.But this year, the limelight will be on the era that is to come — and a movement called Transhumanism, which supports the use of technology to improve the human condition.“We are on the cusp of a new decade, all of us, so a lot of our focus will be looking at the future,” said Meira Blaustein, executive director and co-founder of the film festival.A highlight will be a panel discussion, “Redesigning Humanity — The New Frontier,” featuring scientists and ethicists. One panelist, Raymond Kurzweil, is an author and trailblazer in the field of artificial intelligence; another, Martine Rothblatt, began the first satellite radio company and is active in bioethics, gender freedom and antiracism causes.Other panels at the festival, which is to run from Wednesday through Oct. 4, will consider the future of film distribution and of independent filmmaking.In the world premiere of “2B,” directed by the Emmy Award-winner Richard Kroehling, the focus will be on the challenge of the biotech revolution. And the feature-length pilot of “Caprica,” a new series on Syfy (formerly known as the Sci Fi Channel), introduces two rival families competing in a powerful society with technology decades ahead of the 21st century’s, on the brink of collapse.'"
"'09-09-27,'0','Al Pacino played Teach in David Mamet’s “American Buffalo” on Broadway. So did Robert Duvall and John Leguizamo. Dustin Hoffman played the role in the 1996 film, which almost nobody saw.So clearly Teach — a man largely unarmed in any battle of wits who nevertheless speaks in casual pronouncements and escalating non sequiturs — is the plum role. And Andrew Benator does an admirable job in the uneven but satisfying new production at Theaterworks Hartford.“American Buffalo” is a three-man play. Donny (John Ahlin), a relatively low-key middle-aged junk shop owner, is the organizing force. His shop, the play’s only setting, is so depressingly seedy that theatergoers may want to rush to the stage and start fumigating.Donny is joined by a much younger man, Bobby (Zachary Spicer, a Theaterworks newcomer), who doesn’t take care of himself, can’t remember much of anything and always asks to borrow money. Bobby is a drug addict, but that has not taken a toll on his looks. At least not as portrayed by Mr. Spicer, who is surprisingly believable despite looking far too healthy for the role.Inexplicably, Donny has chosen Bobby to carry out a burglary he’s planning. A man who lives nearby recently spent an impressive amount of money on a buffalo-head nickel at the shop. Donny concludes that the man must have a coin collection at home, probably worth a lot of money.Donny’s pal Teach shows up, looking a bit like Harry Dean Stanton (if Mr. Stanton were auditioning for a remake of “Reservoir Dogs”) and ranting about people who don’t appreciate his picking up the check all the time and who then begrudge him a slice of toast. The first decision Teach makes, just because he decides it is his to make, is that Bobby cannot be trusted to carry out the burglary. In fact, what the heck was Donny thinking?'"
"'09-09-27,'0','In New York City, heroin is being packaged in covert locations and distributed at levels not seen since the heroin crisis of the 1970s. The evidence, according to the city’s special narcotics prosecutor, Bridget G. Brennan, is the enormous number of tiny glassine bags, containing single doses of heroin, seized during recent drug raids, which suggest heavy local distribution and use.In recent months, drug agents have discovered unusually productive heroin mills, Ms. Brennan said, where the drug is often cut with lactose, baby laxatives or vitamin B in coffee bean grinders that are bought in bulk because their motors burn out from overuse. The mills are operated around the clock by as many as eight workers at a time in quasi-assembly lines.In the 1970s, Ms. Brennan said, the purity level of heroin was less than 5 percent; these days, it can be as high as 20 percent, making overdoses more likely. Also, younger, more educated people are getting hooked, she said.“One of the key things is to educate people, and that’s where we’ve fallen a little short,” she said. “We’ve let our guard down.”This summer, she started reaching out to treatment experts, Partnership for a Drug-Free America and the State Assembly to raise the alarm.“So often young people in particular think law enforcement’s out there to ruin their party,” Ms. Brennan said. “That’s why I’m reaching out to these other organizations. I think the message might be more effective if it comes from someone else.”'"
"'09-09-27,'0','FORD may soon be getting some competition in the United States for the Transit Connect, its new-to-the-market small commercial van.Nissan, which already sells commercial vehicles in much of the rest of the world — Europe, Japan, China, Mexico, South America, Australia and the Middle East but not the United States and Canada — has been expanding its Canton, Miss., plant to start building commercial vans next year. It announced plans to build three all-new products there.Last year, Nissan showed a design study called the NV2500 — something of a mobile construction company office, built on the frame of Nissan’s full-size Titan pickup — as a hint of its possible future entry into the American market.In March, the company announced it would enter the global small van market with the NV200, a front-wheel-drive design built on a passenger-car platform.The NV200 has been on sale in Japan since May and goes on sale in Europe next month, where it will compete directly with the Transit Connect, said Joe Castelli, vice president for commercial and fleet vehicles of Nissan North America.'"

"'09-09-28,'1','One thing that definitely happened over the winter and spring was our tour guides were not getting tipped. We get the sense that people don’t bring any extra money with them. If the tour guides are lucky, they’ll get a dollar from a lot of the students.I keep hearing of people losing their jobs, so I’m just hopeful. I’m still being cautious. I really don’t feel like we need to hire anybody more. But I happen to be hiring a salesperson to replace someone who is leaving. We’ve had a flood of résumés. Last time, we had a trickle of résumés. This time, not only have I gotten 45 to 50, but literally two weeks after I posted the job I’m still getting résumés.Wayne Sosin, 55, the president of Worksman Cycles in Ozone Park, Queens, has had to come up with alternative uses for the industrial tricycles and heavy-duty bicycles his company has traditionally sold to auto plants and other big factories and warehouses. New sales to universities, zoos and prisons have helped. Worksman has called back some laid-off workers and increased hours for others.The economy is still suffering obviously, and a lot of our customers in the automotive field are going to take a while to bounce back. But we’ve found some new markets for old products and it seems to be turning in the right direction for us. So it’s been pretty exciting the last couple of months.We’re always busiest in the spring. This year we got off to a slow start. The economy definitely had a lot of people watching their pennies and holding back on orders. Unfortunately, on the East Coast the weather was awful for the bicycle industry in May and June. There was so much rain and dreariness, it definitely put a hurting on the market for recreational bikes and trikes in the whole Northeast. But as the months have passed, there’s been some uptick in our business activity.For us the challenge was that we saw that our core customers — the G.M.’s, Fords and Chryslers — were certainly not going to be able to support us with their normal level of business, as they were shuttering factories, laying off employees. So we really had to come up with an alternate strategy of finding other markets.We looked around and said, well, what kind of environment would be appropriate for using industrial-grade tricycles or heavy-duty bicycles? One of the ones we found was the federal prison systems. We’ve established about 20 federal prisons or so that are now using tricycles in a trial basis to replace some of the motor vehicles that they were using, both for the prison population and for their own staffs. So that’s one of the exciting markets. University bike-share programs is another one. Princeton University has selected Worksman Cycles for the bikes that they’re going to use for their student bike-share program. They’ll have 100 bicycles available for their students to ride.We’ve actually brought back a few of the employees that we had to furlough for a while. That was wonderful to be able to do. We’re actually in the process now actively of looking for some sheet-metal mechanics. So we should be adding some staff pretty soon. We’re up a little bit in employment from where we were and the number of hours that people are working. We’re almost back to working the regular 40-hour weeks, in fact working some overtime, which is encouraging. So it’s going in the right direction.Mouhamad Shami, 54, the owner of Alfanoose, a Middle Eastern restaurant on Maiden Lane in the financial district, says he owes his landlord almost $25,000 for property taxes and was forced to cancel his health insurance just after having an operation. With fewer orders coming from big banks, he is trying to hold on until his son finishes college next year and joins him full time.Between my overhead and the drop in the business I couldn’t continue with my health insurance coverage. I dropped it at the beginning of this year.I fell here. They were mopping the floor. I didn’t go to the doctor for X-rays or anything. I just went to an acupuncturist on Nassau Street and he said nothing is broken. So I was in pain for about six to eight weeks.I work from, like, 10 o’clock in the morning till 10:30 at night. I haven’t been able to take any time off except for the last year, when I did a hernia operation. But I took only one week off. For the past six years now, I haven’t taken vacation.I just hired one guy. I’m getting tired, to tell you the truth. I was pulling the work for more than two people, three people as a matter of fact. Now I start to feel it. You know I’m not a kid anymore. Sometimes, believe it or not, I feel like the weight of my upper body cannot carry my legs anymore. I’m hoping again, you know, that things they will get better. If they don’t, I’m just going to let him go.I’m hoping that things they will go back to normal. If the rest of the companies they start making profits like Goldman Sachs and like Chase Manhattan bank, the area, it will survive and it will revive itself. So that’s what we’re hoping for.If I can’t keep up, then I’m going to look for a smaller place. Then I’ll take a loan to set up because I’ll be confident. With the amount of business that I’m making right now, I’ll be able to survive in a less-overhead, smaller place. This place, it means so much to me. I built it up from scratch. I keep trying to convince myself that I’ll be able to save it, I’ll be able to save it. So I’m going to give it one more chance till the end of this year.Ruben Villasante, 47, owns a small contracting firm, V & V Construction, that specializes in painting and home renovations in Ditmas Park, Brooklyn. Most of his customers are calling him for repairs and repainting, not kitchen replacements or other renovation projects. One member of his four-man crew quit this summer, but Mr. Villasante said that he would wait for business to pick up before replacing him.Business is like it was six months ago. It didn’t keep falling and it didn’t pick up either. People are struggling. There’s no money outside. There’s no loans. Houses are not selling. Therefore, basically what we’re doing are repairs, not renovations. We’re redoing a porch and have another porch coming up. We’re painting here and there.Before, I used to have lined up for the next year already two or three months of work, but that’s not happening this year. There’s a lot of talking about doing something but there’s nothing on paper already set. It’s not “put me down for March,” “put me down in April.” What is happening is, “I’ll call you in the spring,” “I’m going to give you a call when the weather gets better.”Money’s not the issue. The issue’s competition. It used to be there was a lot of work to do and people didn’t have to ask prices. Now, people have two or three bids on a job. If I get a new customer, I know I’m not going to be the only one bidding on it.It looks a lot better here than in Florida. I was in Florida four weeks ago and everything is so quiet. I was in one of those big malls at 10 a.m. and they had all the salespeople and all the lights on and just two customers. I was thinking, how do they stay in business?Now I have three men. One just left. I didn’t have to rehire. It’s too close to the winter. Winter comes and there’s not much we can do outside. We’re going to handle what we have until December and then regroup in March.Michael Menna, 46, owns Menna’s Quality Meats and Salumeria, his family’s 50-year-old meat market in the Throgs Neck section of the Bronx. The cool, wet start to the summer cut into sales of meat for the barbecue, Mr. Menna said. On the flip side, the store’s power bills were low, allowing Mr. Menna to pay down a debt to Con Edison that built up as the recession dragged on. He closed for a week in August to go on a family vacation.Business is not back to where it’s supposed to be, but we’re seeing light at the end of the tunnel. We lost all of June and half of July to the weather but we saved on Con Ed. So that helped. I didn’t put the air on until August, so that was a big savings.People are still being somewhat frugal, but they’re starting to buy again. Hopefully after the summer, we’ll get back on a regular schedule. August was a little quiet, as it’s expected to be because of people going on vacation. Right after Labor Day, you get a nice shot in the arm. Hopefully, we’ll have a nice consistent fall right into the busy holiday season.It’s been a while since it was hopping. But you see signs of it coming back.We’re just staying on kind of a skeleton crew, keeping the hours to a minimum. Everybody’s been pitching in. A lot of people are taking on more jobs in the store, including myself. Sometimes people complain that they’re doing too many jobs. Sometimes we need to have a meeting about that and remind everybody where we’re at and that everybody needs to help each other out.I’ve just tried to get a little more aggressive with advertising. Trying to get some more bargains out for the customers so they come into the store. This was a family business that my dad and my uncles, like 40 years ago, started. Things were so much different then. Everybody shopped at the local butcher. It’s not like that any more.We’ve been around a long time. We’re a little bit of a landmark here. So we’re going to try to keep it a landmark.'"

Biden Jr. earlier this month about “the need for this conference to be a success.”Privately, though, American officials express concern that it will be little more than a political exercise before Mr. Maliki’s re-election campaign unless the Iraqis do more to create a solid foundation for foreign investors willing to take a risk on the country’s prospects.Mr. Biden, in his meetings with Mr. Maliki and other senior leaders, stressed the need for better regulatory and financial systems, according to a senior official traveling with him. The official said that reforms would, for example, allow the Overseas Private Investment Corporation to extend loan guarantees to American companies interested in investing in Iraq.Few, though, expect the legislation to proceed before next year’s parliamentary elections and the inevitable political bargaining that will follow, putting off significant reforms, and thus investment, for at least a year.“Capital is cowardly,” said Mejul Mahdi Ali, the president of Diyala’s newly created investment commission. “It is always looking for a safe place.”As he spoke, an explosion reverberated through Baquba; a roadside bomb killed three police officers.Mr. Ali complained that many government ministers showed little interest in foreign or private investment, or actively opposed it. The commission was kicked out of two government offices before moving to a shabby villa, equipped not by the provincial government, but the American reconstruction team at Forward Operating Base Warhorse, which is nearby. He has not been paid in three months, he said.The provincial government’s idea of economic development, he said, is a plan to buy 10,000 taxis and lease them to drivers, against his advice. Baquba might soon be the easiest place in the world to catch a cab, but he said, “That’s not investment.”Still, even with uncertain security and insufficient legal protections, Iraq has started attracting the attention of investors.Daimler AG signed an agreement with Iraq last year and opened an office in Baghdad. Case New Holland, the international tractor maker, began building the first of 1,250 tractors for the Iraqi government at a factory in Iskandariya, once a center of the insurgency in an area south of Baghdad known as the “triangle of death.”Workers broke ground in July on a high-end $100 million hotel near the “crossed swords” monument in Baghdad’s international zone.“Potential investors have a virtual open landscape to develop projects that will fill the needs of Iraq’s expanding and demanding population,” Dr. Araji of the national investment commission wrote in an investors guide published this year.Optimism has been premature before.The Ministry of Industry last year solicited bids for more than 40 projects involving partnerships with state-owned enterprises, but received them for only 11. Most of those have since failed to come to fruition, including the $60 million proposal for the electrical company here in Baquba.The plant, with eight separate factories, was originally built in 1982 and equipped with machines by Mitsubishi that are now out of date. They still function only because workers have cannibalized parts.When the war in Diyala was at its worst in 2007, the company shut down; the Islamic Army of Iraq, one of the leading insurgent factions, established its headquarters nearby. The director, Abdul Wadoud al-Sattar Mahmoud, went into hiding; his personal assistant was killed.The violence ultimately eased, and the factory began to operate again, though largely with the help of the American reconstruction team at Warhorse and the Task Force for Business Stability Operations, a Pentagon agency that supports economic development in Iraq. The task force’s function has been to restore production at Iraq’s state-owned enterprises, after American officials initially sought to shut them immediately after the invasion in 2003.A report by the task force in 2007 criticized the factory’s management and described the factory’s “most insidious” problem as “a general lack of industriousness.”Government policies have not helped make it profitable either.The Ministry of Industry has vastly expanded its payroll to 3,400 workers, compared with 1,200 after the invasion, and raised salaries, driving up the costs of its products. At the same time, a decision by the Coalition Provisional Authority to lower customs duties has meant cheaper foreign products. The factory now has 12,000 unsold ceiling fans and one million spark plugs stored in its warehouses.Mr. Mahmoud said that while one ministry drove up costs, another, the Ministry of Electricity, complained that it could buy cheaper transformers from abroad. “The competition here is very difficult for me,” he said.Iraqi law forbids foreign companies from owning equity in state-owned enterprises. The Ministry of Industry also forbids wholesale restructuring of companies that would require dismissing workers.Even worse, in the case of the factory here, when the Ministry of Industry initialed the $60 million investment deal with an Egyptian-Iraqi consortium last year, it suspended its subsidies for the steel needed to make electrical transformers, potentially its most lucrative product in a country starved for power.The consortium, however, pulled out of the deal earlier this year — because of the general international economic crisis, officials said — and the supply of steel necessary to keep production going dwindled. The production line would have ground to a halt if the Americans had not stepped in with the grant.“We could produce more if we had raw materials,” the line’s manager, Abdul Salam Mohammed, said plaintively.The director, Mr. Mahmoud, has begun to personally lobby provincial governments for business, deeply discounting the transformers and worsening the company’s losses, something he never had to do before.“This is a new experience for us,” he said.'"
"'09-09-28,'1','TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras — The de facto government of Honduras expelled four diplomats from the Organization of American States on Sunday and threatened to shut down the Brazilian Embassy, where the ousted president, Manuel Zelaya, has been holed up for a week.In a sign of rising tension, the government issued a decree Sunday that banned unauthorized gatherings and allowed the authorities to shut down broadcasters and arrest anyone deemed to pose a threat to their lives and that of others.The diplomats were members of an advance team planning a visit of foreign ministers from member countries to try to negotiate an end to the political crisis here. The organization had been invited by the de facto government to hold talks here, then disinvited, and invited again before being turned back at the airport on Sunday.Carlos López Contreras, the foreign minister of the de facto government, said Sunday that the group had arrived before the government said it could. “They fell on us by surprise,” he said.A fifth member of the team, John Biehl of Chile, was allowed to stay, Mr. López said, because he was a key player in the Honduran crisis mediation in Costa Rica.'"
"'09-09-28,'1','It might sound churlish to say, but Canada’s bankers may have been too buttoned-down for their own good. A combination of regulatory restraint and conservative management allowed the nation’s financial institutions to avoid the large-scale crisis that took place in the United States and elsewhere. Yet these traits may have also caused them to miss out on subsequent opportunities to expand their businesses abroad.None of the major banks in Canada failed in this financial crisis. In fact, they found themselves in stronger shape. The total market capitalization of the big five Canadian banks — Royal Bank of Canada, Toronto Dominion, Bank of Nova Scotia, Bank of Montreal and CIBC — has risen 8 percent since the start of 2007. By comparison, the five biggest American commercial banks lost almost 40 percent, vaporizing more than $350 billion of market value.There are many reasons that American banks got into trouble while the Canadians didn’t. Among them: 50 percent greater leverage among American banks, which amplified losses; less prudent underwriting and credit standards; a regulatory patchwork that allowed banks to play one set of watchdogs off against another; American government officials’ belief that the private sector needed less oversight; and a larger reliance on short-term borrowing.These factors all played a role and fed upon each other. For example, Canadian regulations encourage banks to keep more loans on their books. While half of all United States mortgage loans were sold at the peak of the securitization bubble, the figure for Canada was about 25 percent. Since the banks had to eat more of their own cooking, so to speak, there was more incentive to make sure borrowers could repay.The Canadians also had a bit of luck. They weren’t forced to step in and provide liquidity to their off-balance-sheet vehicles at the height of the crisis because, unlike in the United States, the standard legal arrangements didn’t require that. More important, the American cultural mood latched onto the idea of buying houses and flipping them for hefty profits to a much greater extent. Canadians were more circumspect, limiting the housing bubble north of the border.But the relatively strong performance of Canadian banks after the financial panic presents a question as to why they have not been more aggressive in exploiting American rivals’ weaknesses. After all, Canada’s domestic market is already sewn up. Big mergers at home are over: the government shot down two attempted megadeals in the mid-1990s. With American rivals nursing hangovers, it would seem a perfect time to swoop south and buy troubled franchises or try and expand market share.'"
"'09-09-28,'1','Verizon Wireless will not start to unveil its 4G network until the middle of next year. And AT&T will come out with its upgrade a year later, although its 3G technology can be upgraded to offer much faster speeds than the system used by Sprint and Verizon.But Sprint’s 4G push comes with huge technical and financial risks. The company is using a technology called WiMax, which was initially developed by Intel to offer wireless service over large distances to computers in homes and offices, not to mobile phones.The rest of the wireless industry has settled on a global standard called L.T.E. (for Long Term Evolution). While it is still in development, some experts say L.T.E. will be able to handle more traffic than WiMax, and the L.T.E. systems planned by AT&T and Verizon would use radio frequencies that penetrate buildings better than those used by Clearwire.Moreover, WiMax proved to be more expensive to deploy than the cash-starved Sprint could afford. Last year, it merged its WiMax effort, initially called Xohm, with Clearwire, a struggling start-up initially backed by Craig McCaw, the cellphone pioneer, that went public in 2007 but ran into its own financing troubles. The combined company raised $3.2 billion from Intel, Google and three cable companies: Comcast, Time Warner Cable and Bright House Networks.The new financing created an opportunity to sell Clearwire’s WiMax service in partnership with its cable investors, said Bill Morrow, who was hired last spring as chief executive of Clearwire.“Verizon has 81 million customers and AT&T has 79 million,” Mr. Morrow said. “As I divide the camps, that leaves 90 million for the rest of us to band together and share the costs of the build-out.”Clearwire offers service both for laptops and for home networks, largely in areas that are not well served by existing cable and phone companies. The company is slightly undercutting competitors, offering unlimited broadband for $45 a month, with lower prices for slower speeds and limited usage.Sprint offers a $70-a-month plan that lets laptops connect to Clearwire’s 4G network wherever it is turned on and to Sprint’s 3G network everywhere else.Next year, Sprint will introduce smartphones that can use the faster 4G networks where they are available. Voice traffic will still be handled by Sprint’s current network.Mr. Morrow’s early months at Clearwire have been notable for a fair bit of management turmoil. David Sach, hired in March to be chief financial officer, left in August, taking a $1 million severance check with him.But Mr. Morrow’s biggest problem may be that he needs to raise a lot more money for Clearwire. The company says it needs an additional $2 billion by the end of next year. One possibility is to sell a stake to T-Mobile, which does not have much spectrum for a 4G network.A person briefed on the fund-raising said talks with T-Mobile were at an early stage and Clearwire was also talking to other potential investors as well as current holders that may put more money in.Securing the financing is just the first challenge, according to Philip Cusick of Macquarie Securities. “Trying to build a brand name in the wireless space is going to be really tough,” he said.Clearwire’s shares closed Friday at $8.22 and are down about 25 percent over the last year.One eager investor is Sprint. Dan Hesse, the company’s chief executive, told investors this month that Sprint wanted to preserve its majority ownership.After all, the arrangement gives it the benefit of a faster data network while sharing the cost with other investors. “Instead of investing 100 cents on the dollar, we can invest 50 or 60 cents on the dollar,” Mr. Hesse said at an investor conference.Clearwire’s technology is getting mixed initial reviews, with some customers complaining about slow speeds.“From 1 a.m. to 6 a.m., it’s pretty fast,” said Brandon Rust, an accountant in Portland, Tex., who signed up for Clearwire early this month. “But once people wake up, it slows to a crawl.”Michael Thelander, the chief executive of Signals Research, an independent research firm, said Clearwire’s network in Portland, Tex., was excellent. His tests showed an average speed of 3.8 megabits a second for downloads and 1.7 megabits a second for uploads, four times as fast as current 3G networks.Of course, any network should be zippy when there are few customers vying for the capacity. Clearwire says it is well positioned to handle crowds because it has assembled 150 megahertz of wireless spectrum.That is far more than AT&T and Verizon bought for their L.T.E. networks in last year’s government auction of the airwaves. But the frequencies bought by the big telephone companies were reclaimed from old analog television stations, and they are said to travel farther and penetrate buildings better than the higher frequencies used by Clearwire.Clearwire’s best chance to get ahead may be the new marketing relationships with its cable partners, Time Warner and Comcast, which are positioning WiMax access as a mobile extension of their existing cable home broadband services. At Comcast, adding Clearwire to home Internet service will cost $30 a month.“Customers want fast, and they want it wherever they are,” said Mike Roudi, the group vice president for wireless service at Time Warner, which has not announced its prices.Neither cable company has announced wireless voice service, but both have the option to resell Sprint’s cellphone service to their customers.While Clearwire’s initial market is traveling business people who want the fastest connections, the company’s success may depend on how well it and its partners can persuade people already paying for cellphones and home broadband that they also need high-speed Internet access on the go.In other words, how much is that fourth G really worth?'"
"'09-09-28,'1','About 300 people — scholars with an interest in Bruce Springsteen or Springsteen fanatics with an interest in scholarship — made their way toward the Jersey Shore for the 2009 Glory Days symposium, a four-day conference dedicated to academic interpretations and declarations of love for the Boss. The symposium, a follow-up to the first Glory Days in 2005, was organized by Virginia Tech University and Penn State-Altoona but held on and near the campus of Monmouth State University in West Long Branch, N.J. (How could you have a Springsteen festival and not have it in New Jersey?) Organized events included pilgrimages to the Stone Pony in Asbury Park, theatrical performances based on Mr. Springsteen’s work, panel discussions and the presentation of academic papers, including, from a session on gender: “ ‘Wrap Your Legs ’Round These Velvet Rims and Strap Your Hands Across My Engines’: Motor Vehicles and Masculinity in Bruce Springsteen’s Album ‘Born to Run.’ ”'"
"'09-09-28,'1','One thing that definitely happened over the winter and spring was our tour guides were not getting tipped. We get the sense that people don’t bring any extra money with them. If the tour guides are lucky, they’ll get a dollar from a lot of the students.I keep hearing of people losing their jobs, so I’m just hopeful. I’m still being cautious. I really don’t feel like we need to hire anybody more. But I happen to be hiring a salesperson to replace someone who is leaving. We’ve had a flood of résumés. Last time, we had a trickle of résumés. This time, not only have I gotten 45 to 50, but literally two weeks after I posted the job I’m still getting résumés.Wayne Sosin, 55, the president of Worksman Cycles in Ozone Park, Queens, has had to come up with alternative uses for the industrial tricycles and heavy-duty bicycles his company has traditionally sold to auto plants and other big factories and warehouses. New sales to universities, zoos and prisons have helped. Worksman has called back some laid-off workers and increased hours for others.The economy is still suffering obviously, and a lot of our customers in the automotive field are going to take a while to bounce back. But we’ve found some new markets for old products and it seems to be turning in the right direction for us. So it’s been pretty exciting the last couple of months.We’re always busiest in the spring. This year we got off to a slow start. The economy definitely had a lot of people watching their pennies and holding back on orders. Unfortunately, on the East Coast the weather was awful for the bicycle industry in May and June. There was so much rain and dreariness, it definitely put a hurting on the market for recreational bikes and trikes in the whole Northeast. But as the months have passed, there’s been some uptick in our business activity.For us the challenge was that we saw that our core customers — the G.M.’s, Fords and Chryslers — were certainly not going to be able to support us with their normal level of business, as they were shuttering factories, laying off employees. So we really had to come up with an alternate strategy of finding other markets.We looked around and said, well, what kind of environment would be appropriate for using industrial-grade tricycles or heavy-duty bicycles? One of the ones we found was the federal prison systems. We’ve established about 20 federal prisons or so that are now using tricycles in a trial basis to replace some of the motor vehicles that they were using, both for the prison population and for their own staffs. So that’s one of the exciting markets. University bike-share programs is another one. Princeton University has selected Worksman Cycles for the bikes that they’re going to use for their student bike-share program. They’ll have 100 bicycles available for their students to ride.We’ve actually brought back a few of the employees that we had to furlough for a while. That was wonderful to be able to do. We’re actually in the process now actively of looking for some sheet-metal mechanics. So we should be adding some staff pretty soon. We’re up a little bit in employment from where we were and the number of hours that people are working. We’re almost back to working the regular 40-hour weeks, in fact working some overtime, which is encouraging. So it’s going in the right direction.Mouhamad Shami, 54, the owner of Alfanoose, a Middle Eastern restaurant on Maiden Lane in the financial district, says he owes his landlord almost $25,000 for property taxes and was forced to cancel his health insurance just after having an operation. With fewer orders coming from big banks, he is trying to hold on until his son finishes college next year and joins him full time.Between my overhead and the drop in the business I couldn’t continue with my health insurance coverage. I dropped it at the beginning of this year.I fell here. They were mopping the floor. I didn’t go to the doctor for X-rays or anything. I just went to an acupuncturist on Nassau Street and he said nothing is broken. So I was in pain for about six to eight weeks.I work from, like, 10 o’clock in the morning till 10:30 at night. I haven’t been able to take any time off except for the last year, when I did a hernia operation. But I took only one week off. For the past six years now, I haven’t taken vacation.I just hired one guy. I’m getting tired, to tell you the truth. I was pulling the work for more than two people, three people as a matter of fact. Now I start to feel it. You know I’m not a kid anymore. Sometimes, believe it or not, I feel like the weight of my upper body cannot carry my legs anymore. I’m hoping again, you know, that things they will get better. If they don’t, I’m just going to let him go.I’m hoping that things they will go back to normal. If the rest of the companies they start making profits like Goldman Sachs and like Chase Manhattan bank, the area, it will survive and it will revive itself. So that’s what we’re hoping for.If I can’t keep up, then I’m going to look for a smaller place. Then I’ll take a loan to set up because I’ll be confident. With the amount of business that I’m making right now, I’ll be able to survive in a less-overhead, smaller place. This place, it means so much to me. I built it up from scratch. I keep trying to convince myself that I’ll be able to save it, I’ll be able to save it. So I’m going to give it one more chance till the end of this year.Ruben Villasante, 47, owns a small contracting firm, V & V Construction, that specializes in painting and home renovations in Ditmas Park, Brooklyn. Most of his customers are calling him for repairs and repainting, not kitchen replacements or other renovation projects. One member of his four-man crew quit this summer, but Mr. Villasante said that he would wait for business to pick up before replacing him.Business is like it was six months ago. It didn’t keep falling and it didn’t pick up either. People are struggling. There’s no money outside. There’s no loans. Houses are not selling. Therefore, basically what we’re doing are repairs, not renovations. We’re redoing a porch and have another porch coming up. We’re painting here and there.Before, I used to have lined up for the next year already two or three months of work, but that’s not happening this year. There’s a lot of talking about doing something but there’s nothing on paper already set. It’s not “put me down for March,” “put me down in April.” What is happening is, “I’ll call you in the spring,” “I’m going to give you a call when the weather gets better.”Money’s not the issue. The issue’s competition. It used to be there was a lot of work to do and people didn’t have to ask prices. Now, people have two or three bids on a job. If I get a new customer, I know I’m not going to be the only one bidding on it.It looks a lot better here than in Florida. I was in Florida four weeks ago and everything is so quiet. I was in one of those big malls at 10 a.m. and they had all the salespeople and all the lights on and just two customers. I was thinking, how do they stay in business?Now I have three men. One just left. I didn’t have to rehire. It’s too close to the winter. Winter comes and there’s not much we can do outside. We’re going to handle what we have until December and then regroup in March.Michael Menna, 46, owns Menna’s Quality Meats and Salumeria, his family’s 50-year-old meat market in the Throgs Neck section of the Bronx. The cool, wet start to the summer cut into sales of meat for the barbecue, Mr. Menna said. On the flip side, the store’s power bills were low, allowing Mr. Menna to pay down a debt to Con Edison that built up as the recession dragged on. He closed for a week in August to go on a family vacation.Business is not back to where it’s supposed to be, but we’re seeing light at the end of the tunnel. We lost all of June and half of July to the weather but we saved on Con Ed. So that helped. I didn’t put the air on until August, so that was a big savings.People are still being somewhat frugal, but they’re starting to buy again. Hopefully after the summer, we’ll get back on a regular schedule. August was a little quiet, as it’s expected to be because of people going on vacation. Right after Labor Day, you get a nice shot in the arm. Hopefully, we’ll have a nice consistent fall right into the busy holiday season.It’s been a while since it was hopping. But you see signs of it coming back.We’re just staying on kind of a skeleton crew, keeping the hours to a minimum. Everybody’s been pitching in. A lot of people are taking on more jobs in the store, including myself. Sometimes people complain that they’re doing too many jobs. Sometimes we need to have a meeting about that and remind everybody where we’re at and that everybody needs to help each other out.I’ve just tried to get a little more aggressive with advertising. Trying to get some more bargains out for the customers so they come into the store. This was a family business that my dad and my uncles, like 40 years ago, started. Things were so much different then. Everybody shopped at the local butcher. It’s not like that any more.We’ve been around a long time. We’re a little bit of a landmark here. So we’re going to try to keep it a landmark.'"

An administration task force on detention policy has sent its recommendations to the White House, but the issue remains unresolved. Federal officials have toured prisons including those at Fort Leavenworth, Kan., and Camp Pendleton, Calif.; a maximum-security prison in Standish, Mich., northwest of Detroit; and the United States Naval Consolidated Brig in Charleston, S.C.But the administration has faced Congressional opposition and local hostility whenever a potential site becomes public. A federal official said Monday that the Charleston brig remained a possibility, but local officials have complained that it is only a medium-security facility.The federal official, who would speak about so sensitive a subject only on condition of not being identified, said Leavenworth had apparently been ruled out after strong opposition from Kansas’ senators, Sam Brownback and Pat Roberts, both Republicans.The status of the Michigan prison, meanwhile, remains unclear. Representative Peter Hoekstra, a Republican candidate for governor, has taken a strong stand against housing detainees there, but others in the state’s delegation have said they would be open to it if the local community was receptive.Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, said on “Fox News Sunday” that she would be willing to accept some detainees in her state. On Monday her spokesman, Phil LaVelle, said that Mrs. Feinstein had been answering a “hypothetical question” and that “she was not referring to any specific prison.”Complicating the administration’s problem is that the Pentagon spending bill coming before the Senate this week would prohibit the use of federal money for the transfer of Guantánamo detainees to American prisons, or their release within the United States, through next September.Should the administration want flexibility to bring in prisoners during the next year, it would have to seek some adjustments in that language, which could reignite the Congressional fight over the Guantánamo center.The cases of the approximately 240 detainees who were at Guantánamo when Mr. Obama took office have been reviewed by a joint military-civilian committee including prosecutors. Of those, about 90 have been approved for transfer to other countries; some 17 of the 90 have already been moved.About 40 other detainees, including five men charged before a military tribunal with complicity in the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, have been referred for prosecution in either military or civilian courts. It appears likely, for example, that the alleged Sept. 11 plotters will be tried in federal court in New York; that means they could be held at a correctional center there that has housed other defendants in terrorism cases.That leaves about 100 remaining detainees.

"'09-09-29,'0','British Airways, which is starting a business-class-only service from London to New York on Tuesday, may eliminate some short-haul flights to restore earnings.“This is an airline that really has to bite the bullet on short-haul, looking long and hard at what it’s costing and whether they can ever get a decent margin out of it,” said Howard Wheeldon, senior strategist at BGC Partners in London. “Some U.K. and European routes have a very limited future.”Fares between European countries have declined as discount carriers like Ryanair and EasyJet grab market share. Routes like London to Paris, where British Airways pioneered the first international air service in 1919, may be among the first to go because of the shrinking profit margins and the effect of the competing Eurostar high-speed rail service, Mr. Wheeldon said.British Airways is already the biggest carrier between Europe and the United States. The business-class-only experiment from London City airport will help Willie Walsh, British Airways’ chief executive, determine whether the company can fill planes with people flying to and from London alone or whether it still needs a substantial European network to feed passengers from around the region onto long-haul flights.The carrier, Europe’s third-largest, has historically made almost all of its profit from first- and business-class travel and last year derived 45 percent of revenue from premium tickets that accounted for only 13 percent of seat sales. The company’s revenue fell 12 percent in the three months through June as it had a £106 million ($169 million) net loss, the carrier said July 31.'"
"'09-09-29,'0','Has Darrell Hammond left NBC’s “Saturday Night Live”? Mr. Hammond’s status has not been officially disclosed, but this weekend, for the first time since the 1995 season, his name was not included in the opening credits. That might seem definitive, but Mr. Hammond, right, has already appeared twice on this season’s special Thursday editions of “SNL.” And no sketches on Saturday involved any of the impressions the show has relied on Mr. Hammond to provide, like those of Bill Clinton and John McCain. NBC executives and “SNL” staff members declined to comment. One longtime staff member of “SNL,” speaking on condition of anonymity because of the official no-comment position, said that Mr. Hammond’s absence meant he was no longer a regular but added that he remained on good terms with the producers and would be available to perform characters as needed.'"
"'09-09-29,'0','Studies show that all of these strains are associated with reducing diarrhea; LGG, among the most studied, has also shown a benefit in treating atopic eczema and milk allergy in infants and children, according to a 2008 report in The Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology. Meanwhile, both LGG and Dannon’s L. casei strain have been shown in studies of children attending day care to reduce illness.“Lactobacillus is just the bacterium,” said Gregor Reid, director of the Canadian Research and Development Center for Probiotics. “To say a product contains Lactobacillus is like saying you’re bringing George Clooney to a party. It may be the actor, or it may be an 85-year-old guy from Atlanta who just happens to be named George Clooney. With probiotics, there are strain-to-strain differences.”The outcome of a recent legal case may help. Dannon, one of the biggest sellers of probiotic yogurts, settled a class-action lawsuit this month over its Activia yogurts and DanActive yogurt drinks, which claimed to help regulate digestion and stimulate the immune system. As part of the $35 million settlement, Dannon agreed to reimburse dissatisfied consumers and make labeling changes, among them adding the scientific names of probiotic strains it uses.Dannon says that it settled the suit to avoid litigation and that it stands by all of its product claims. The company’s Web site lists numerous scientific studies of its patented probiotic strains.“A scientific approach has been central to our business for decades,” said a spokesman, Michael Neuwirth, who added, “The essence of the claims of Activia and DanActive remain unchanged.”So what health problems can probiotics really help? After gathering at a Yale workshop to review the available evidence, a panel of 12 experts concluded that there was strong evidence that several probiotic strains could reduce diarrhea, including that associated with antibiotic use. Several studies have also suggested that certain probiotics may be useful for irritable bowel syndrome, with the strongest recommendation for Bifidobacterium infantis 35624, the probiotic in the Procter & Gamble supplement Align. (Two members of the panel had ties to Procter & Gamble; three others had ties to other companies that sell probiotics.)A variety of other claims for probiotics, like lowering cholesterol and blood pressure, preventing cavities and reducing cancer risk, were not reviewed by the panel.And scientists continue to debate whether probiotics offer a meaningful benefit to the immune system.“The evidence for the general immune strengthening is just not there,” said Barry R. Goldin, a Tufts professor who helped discover LGG but no longer receives royalties from the patent.But the gastrointestinal tract is an important part of the immune system, and studies show that intestinal bacteria play an essential role in immune defenses. These bacteria not only aid digestion but essentially help form a protective barrier inside the intestine.The Yale group, whose report appeared in The Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology in July 2008, concluded that the “immune response is definitely affected by the administration of probiotics.” But it did not decide whether probiotics were useful for general disease prevention and maintaining overall health, saying more study was needed. The group reported that many studies suggested that certain probiotics reduced duration of colds, along with time away from work and day care.“Such findings,” the authors wrote, “suggest that probiotics might be of value for incorporation into the daily diet of healthy people for the purpose of staying healthy.”Consumers interested in probiotics should look for products that list the specific strain on the label and offer readers easy access to scientific studies supporting the claims. A good place to find studies on various probiotic strains is the Web site www.PubMed.gov.'"
"'09-09-29,'0','The 2008 earthquake that killed more than 80,000 people in Sichuan Province in China was especially devastating in three towns — Beichuan, Nanba and Yingxiu. In Yingxiu, nearly two-thirds of the 12,000 inhabitants were killed, while in Beichuan, more than one-quarter of the population of about 20,000 died.A study in Nature Geoscience suggests why these three towns were hit so hard.Using global positioning system and radar data on ground movements, Zheng-Kang Shen of Beijing University and colleagues analyzed how the quake propagated in the Longmen Shan fault zone, a series of parallel faults that run for about 150 miles southwest to northeast in the region.The faults are not continuous; they are made of segments separated by barriers of solid rock. Each of the hard-hit towns sits near one of the barriers.Normally, the researchers suggest, the barriers would stop a quake from propagating from one segment to another. But the 2008 quake was so powerful, they said, that the barriers failed in cascading fashion, causing catastrophic ground motion to spread throughout the fault region. And the peak movement, they say, occurred at the barriers, which is why the towns were devastated.The only good news was that according to the researchers’ calculations this type of barrier-busting quake should occur in this zone on average only once every 4,000 years.'"
"'09-09-29,'0','A new study finds that diabetes significantly increases a woman’s risk of developing atrial fibrillation, a common and potentially dangerous irregular heart rhythm that doctors often miss.Researchers at Kaiser Permanente compared 17,372 diabetic patients in its registry with similar nondiabetic patients, and followed them for an average of seven years. They found that 3.6 percent of those with diabetes had atrial fibrillation, compared with only 2.5 percent of the others.But while men in both groups had higher rates of fibrillation than women, having diabetes did not in and of itself increase their risk. For women, on the other hand, diabetes was a more important factor than even obesity or high blood pressure, increasing the risk by more than a quarter.The paper is being published in the October issue of Diabetes Care.The lead author, Gregory A. Nichols, an investigator with Kaiser Permanente Center for Health Research in Portland, Ore., said the findings underlined the importance of monitoring women with diabetes for the irregular heart rhythm, which often had no outward symptoms.“Atrial fibrillation was more common in men, but the incidence in women with diabetes was almost identical to that of men without diabetes,” Dr. Nichols said. “That’s the take-home message.”'"
"'09-09-29,'0','Here in Minnesota, as in many of the other states, the move to amend the State Constitution is being driven by a handful of Republican lawmakers. The proposed amendment itself does not advocate some particular alternative plan, but sets what its authors see as ground rules for what any future health care system should — and should not — include.“All I’m trying to do is protect the individual’s right to make health care decisions,” said State Representative Tom Emmer, a Republican. “I just don’t want the government getting between my decisions with my doctors.”Many who favor a federal overhaul of health care say it can be affordable only if nearly everyone is required to carry insurance, but the efforts by these state lawmakers actually predate the Obama administration and the current federal health care debate.Proposed constitutional amendments began cropping up after 2006, when Massachusetts enacted a sweeping state measure meant to create nearly universal health coverage for residents. Elsewhere, some leaders — opposed to the possibility of insurance mandates or government-run systems — began suggesting constitutional amendments to block such measures from their own states.In Arizona, with help from Dr. Eric Novack — an orthopedic surgeon who says his intent was not “some grand secessionist plot” but merely a health care overhaul with protections for individuals’ rights — an amendment first went before voters in 2008. It was defeated, but by fewer than 9,000 votes among more than two million cast.This year, Arizona’s Legislature, controlled by Republicans in both chambers, voted to put the question back on the ballot in 2010.Few in the public seemed focused on health care a year ago, those involved in Arizona’s ballot question said, but the recent debate over a federal overhaul has changed all that, and proponents of the amendment believe that will improve its chances both in Arizona and in other states, where similar efforts have taken root.The federal proposals, though, have also changed the potential fallout if such amendments were to pass.Clint Bolick, litigation director at the Goldwater Institute, a conservative research group based in Arizona that favors free enterprise, and who has helped lead Arizona’s efforts, said he believed the inevitable “legal clash” — if the federal government adopts a health care law and if states change their constitutions — was winnable for the states.Although the United States Constitution’s supremacy clause ordinarily allows federal law to, in essence, trump a state law that conflicts with it, Mr. Bolick said that was not always the case, depending on “the strength of the state interest.” Mr. Bolick said he viewed two recent Supreme Court cases, related to an education question in Arizona and a utility district in Texas as indications that the current court might be open to such a state claim.But several other legal experts said they saw little room for such a challenge. “States can no more nullify a federal law like this than they could nullify the civil rights laws by adopting constitutional amendments,” said Timothy Stoltzfus Jost, a health law expert at Washington & Lee University School of Law.Mark A. Hall, a law professor at Wake Forest University who has studied the constitutionality of mandates that people buy health insurance, said, “There is no way this challenge will succeed in court,” adding that the state measures seemed more “sort of an act of defiance, a form of civil disobedience if you will.”Even Randy E. Barnett, a Georgetown law school professor who has written about what he views as legitimate constitutional questions about health insurance mandates, seemed doubtful.“While using federal power to force individuals to buy private insurance raises serious constitutional questions,” Professor Barnett said, “I just don’t see what these state resolutions add to the constitutional objections to this expansion of federal power.”In Minnesota, even before the prospect of a court clash, Mr. Emmer appears to have an uphill battle ahead. Before voters can consider amending the state’s Constitution, Mr. Emmer needs approval from the Legislature, which is dominated by Democrats. He has offered the Health Care Freedom Act in years past, but it has never made its way to a vote, and Margaret Anderson Kelliher, a Democrat and speaker of the House who is also among the wide field of candidates for governor, said last week that she doubted it stood much of a chance this time either.“Most legislators are interested in improving the health of Minnesotans, and how to do more health care reform,” Ms. Kelliher said. “No one thinks the answer is a states’ right movement.”Still, Mr. Emmer, who is a candidate for governor, says he is hopeful. He emphasizes that such an amendment — regardless of court battles over a federal plan — would certainly spare Minnesotans from the potential downsides of some future state health care plan.And this whole amendment notion, he said, would not prevent anyone from taking part in a federal health program; it would merely block people from being forced to do so.As for legal experts’ discounting the states’ chances of trumping a federal plan, Mr. Emmer seemed unconvinced.“They’re essentially saying that state constitutions are meaningless,” he said, “and I disagree.“And tell me where in the U.S. Constitution it says the federal government has the right to provide health care? This is the essence of the debate.”'"
"'09-09-29,'0','Previously, Mr. Obama had said that the pressing issue of health care reform would prevent him from making the trip to Copenhagen. Advisers had also said that they were worried that he could be embarrassed internationally if he traveled to Copenhagen and the committee did not vote for Chicago.So Michelle Obama, a lifelong Chicagoan, was initially chosen to represent the administration. She will arrive in Copenhagen on Wednesday to begin speaking with some of the 106 members of the I.O.C., accompanied by Valerie Jarrett, senior adviser to the president and the head of the White House Office on Olympic, Paralympic and Youth Sport.Already, Mrs. Obama has prepared the other bid cities for an all-out battle to win votes. At a briefing with reporters and Ms. Jarrett in the State Dining Room on Monday, Mrs. Obama said she sat next to Marisa Letícia Lula da Silva, the first lady of Brazil, at a dinner during the Group of 20 economic summit last week in Pittsburgh.“I adore her, but I said, ‘I’m going to hug you now, and then I’m going after you in Copenhagen.’ ” Mrs. Obama said. “And she said, ‘You, too.’ So the gloves are off.”The Obamas, whose Chicago home is a short walk from the proposed Olympic stadium, will be part of Chicago’s final presentation Friday and will field questions from the I.O.C.Mr. Obama made the decision, Ms. Jarrett said, because “he wanted to make sure he did it at a time when it wouldn’t have an impact on health care reform.” Earlier in the day, Mr. Gibbs said Mr. Obama was going to Copenhagen because Mr. Obama thought “health care is in a better place.”At a briefing at the White House on Monday, Mrs. Obama said she and her husband were aware that his trip put pressure on him to deliver.“You’re darned if you do and you’re darned if you don’t,"" she said. “I’d rather be on the side of doing it. And I think that’s how the president feels.”She added: “But we’ve learned, just in a campaign process, that people are making up their minds until the very end, and that one conversation or one example or illustration that connects could make the difference. And our view is, we’re not taking a chance.”Each of the four cities vying for the bid will have a head of state at the vote. Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama of Japan was the final leader to confirm his travel plans, with the announcement made Monday, shortly after Mr. Obama’s. Almost immediately, I.O.C. members and others questioned the necessity of having top leaders drop everything to make the trip.In recent years, it has become increasingly common for a country’s top leader to lobby the I.O.C. Prime Minister Tony Blair of England was said to have won the 2012 Games for London over Paris and New York, arriving in Singapore before the 2005 vote and staging individual meetings with I.O.C. members. Vladimir V. Putin, the president of Russia, was thought to have won votes and the 2014 Games for Sochi when he addressed the membership in English.In a teleconference last week, Jacques Rogge, the I.O.C. president, said it was an honor — not a requirement — that the cities have their country’s top leaders at the vote.“It is also reassurance that public authorities are behind the bid and will be supportive,” he said.Mayor Richard M. Daley of Chicago said in a statement sent Monday that the Obamas “symbolized the hope, opportunity and inspiration that makes Chicago great.”Jonathan Haugen, 32, an editor who lives in the Chicago’s Wicker Park neighborhood, said that he was excited that Mr. Obama would go to Denmark and that he would be watching the vote closely Friday.“Obama gets a lot of respect internationally,” he said. “There are so many factors; maybe Obama could be what it takes to tip the scales.”Dick Pound, an I.O.C. member and a former Olympian from Canada, said Mr. Obama’s presence could prove crucial, pointing out that London beat Paris, which had been an overwhelming favorite, by 54-50.“It’s great for Chicago that the president will be there because the rest of the world considers him a superstar,” Mr. Pound said in a telephone interview from Lausanne, Switzerland. “The difference between his administration and his outreach compared to the previous one is night and day. He’s regarded as a transformational figure, which only helps Chicago.”Some members of the I.O.C., including Mr. Pound, have said there is too much emphasis on having heads of states attend the vote.“This may be getting out of hand, where, if the U.S. is bidding, the president of the free world has to drop everything to be there,” Mr. Pound said. “The risk is that you start getting away from the substance of the bids.“Maybe in the future, if you wish to include a DVD of your head of state, that’s fine. But a personal appearance wouldn’t be permitted. In my personal view, we have to stop and put things back into perspective.”Peter Baker and Rachel L. Swarns contributed reporting from Washington, and Emma Graves Fitzsimmons from Chicago.'"
"'09-09-29,'0','A spokesman for the Iranian Foreign Ministry said at a news conference that the missile tests had been planned for some time and were not linked to the nuclear dispute, the state-run, English-language Press TV reported. The report said the tests were part of an effort to improve Iran’s defenses.Concern about Iranian hostility toward Israel is matched by frequent speculation that Israel might carry out a strike against Iran’s nuclear facilities to prevent it from developing .Hassan Qashqavi, the Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman, said Monday that the just-disclosed enrichment facility was in Fordo, a village about 115 miles south of Tehran, and 60 miles from Natanz, the site of Iran’s other enrichment plant, The Associated Press reported. That would place it, as United States officials have said, close to the holy city of Qum.Less than two weeks ago Mr. Obama canceled a plan from the administration of to station a radar facility in the and 10 ground-based interceptors in as part of what had been described as a shield against potential missile attacks from Iran.The Obama administration now plans to deploy smaller SM-3 interceptors by 2011, first aboard ships and later in Europe, possibly in Poland or the Czech Republic.On Sunday, Iran test-fired three short-range missiles with a range of 90 to 125 miles as part of a military exercise named the Great Prophet IV, the state-run television said. Press TV said the tests of the Shahab-3 and Sejil-2 on Monday were also part of the exercise.An “optimized” Shahab-3 missile has a range of 800 to 1,250 miles, it said. The Sejil-2, a two-stage missile, is more sophisticated than the Shahab-3, although it has a similar range. Parts of western Iran lie some 650 miles from .Iran first acquired the Shahab-3 from . Because the Sejil-2 is powered by solid fuel, experts said, it can be stored in mountains, transported, reassembled and fired on shorter notice, and thus could be harder for Israel or other nations to target.The military exercise and escalating tensions with the West coincide with a period of political uncertainty in Iran, in the aftermath of Iran’s disputed June 12 election.On Monday a protest erupted at Tehran University, the first of the new school year and the first since the demonstrations that followed the vote, when opponents accused President of falsifying results.The Revolutionary Guards were essential to safeguarding the president’s victory and led the violent crackdown after the election that opposition leaders say killed at least 72 people.The force, which also runs the country’s missile program, remains close to Mr. Ahmadinejad and accountable only to the supreme religious leader, Ayatollah .On Sunday, in a deal that underlined its expanding economic and political power, the Revolutionary Guards purchased just over 50 percent of Iran’s Telecommunication Company in a $7.8 billion deal.The Revolutionary Guards, in addition to being part of Iran’s military complex, has in recent years become one of the largest conglomerates in the country. It has been awarded more than 750 construction, oil and gas contracts and has its own ports.Its political influence has also increased, with many of its members elected to in 2003 or appointed as cabinet ministers in 2004.Now, the Revolutionary Guards’ hold on the country’s telecommunications systems will give it further control over land-line, Internet and cellphone services. On election day, the country’s service was cut off; the cellphone network was disconnected during the unrest that followed. Opposition leaders accused the government of misusing state-run services.The deal announced Sunday was part of the government’s plan to privatize business sectors. But critics have complained that the government is awarding institutions close to it while the real private sector is excluded. The Revolutionary Guards’ unit involved in the deal competed only with a company affiliated with the , a paramilitary organization that assisted the Revolutionary Guards in putting down the postelection protests.'"

It has the ability to create incentives that would encourage the provision of plain-vanilla products, for example, by charging reduced oversight fees to firms that offer simpler loans. In the proposed legislation, the agency also has broad power to stop products and practices that are unfair, deceptive or abusive.But the change, which the White House readily accepted, is disturbing because it is an early sop to banks whose ultimate aim is to block the creation of a consumer protection agency, or, failing that, to ensure that it would have no real power. Early concessions in the House mean that it will be up to the Senate to retain the other safeguards in the proposal. Unfortunately, the White House’s willingness to fight for a strong agency and Democrats’ ability to deliver are both in doubt.Similarly, neither the White House nor Congress seems interested now in limiting the riskiest activities of commercial banks, as Mr. Volcker suggested. Rather, the emphasis is on more oversight of too-big-to-fail institutions and creating new legal tools to take control of them if they are in imminent danger of collapse.The big banks, which have only gotten bigger and more powerful since the , prefer that approach. But it may not provide the best protection to taxpayers who are in harm’s way from banks that engage in high-risk capital market activities, such as equity and derivatives trading. The administration and its Congressional supporters have yet to make a strong case that the system can be made substantially safer with behemoth banks. Lawmakers need to consider alternatives.The administration and Congress deserve for renewing momentum toward new rules and regulations for the financial industry. The real test is whether they will channel that momentum in ways that assert the interest of the public above the interests of the banks.1014 2009-09-30 Overregulating of credit ratings might just have a happy ending.With rating firms under pressure from policy makers for their failures over complex structured finance ratings, there must be a tipping point at which they would give up their officially sanctioned status to escape the burdens any changes could bring. If that led to no government involvement in ratings and no reference to ratings in laws, the financial world could be a better place.The Securities and Exchange Commission already approves nationally recognized statistical ratings organizations and is contemplating tightening oversight and regulation further — maybe even making the likes of Moody’s, Standard & Poor’s and Fitch Ratings financially liable for rating errors.Congress is in the game too, with new draft credit rating legislation circulated last week and two hearings set for Wednesday, one called by the House Oversight Committee, led by Representative Edolphus Towns, Democrat of New York, and one by a House financial services subcommittee. Even the National Association of Insurance Commissioners is taking an interest, because insurance watchdogs also use the rating firms’ credit assessments.The badge that comes with being nationally recognized goes alongside references to ratings in laws and regulations. Some of the specifics are unique to the United States, but the overall picture is similar elsewhere. The Treasury and others have said that officials globally should work to reduce government and investor reliance on credit ratings. But the moves toward tighter regulation suggest authorities aren’t ready to cleanse the system of ratings just yet.But it’s just possible to imagine that the big rating firms may do it themselves if they are allowed to, despite the help that the S.E.C.’s seal of approval has given to the market positions, and the profitability, of the big rating firms over the years. For example, if Congress were to approve ideas in the latest draft legislation that insist that raters shoulder significant liability for ratings that turned out badly, or tried to legislate the criteria that rating firms use, that might just drive them to forgo the privileged status of being nationally recognized to avoid the weight of the associated shackles.1015 2009-09-30 PHOENIX (AP) — Cappie Pondexter missed a game-winning tip-in at the fourth-quarter buzzer, but then scored 7 of her 23 points in overtime to help the Phoenix Mercury escape with a 120-116 victory over the Indiana Fever on Tuesday night in Game 1 of the W.N.B.A. Finals.It was the highest-scoring game in league history.Penny Taylor also scored 23 points for Phoenix. Diana Taurasi, named the league’s most valuable player earlier in the day, added 22.Indiana’s Katie Douglas tied the score at 105-105 on a 3-pointer with 7.1 seconds left in regulation, then scored 8 in overtime for 30 points, her career playoff high. Ebony Hoffman had a career-high 27 on 12-of-14 shooting as the Fever set a franchise scoring record in just the second 100-point game in the club’s history.Game 2 in the best-of-five series is Thursday in Phoenix.It was the first M.V.P. award for Taurasi, a four-time All-Star, who led the league in scoring at 23.8 points in her sixth season after being drafted No. 1 out of Connecticut in 2004.Taurasi received 27 first-place votes and 323 points in the voting. The runner-up, Tamika Catchings of Indiana, had three first-place votes and 163 points. Indiana’s Douglas was third.1016 2009-09-30 A military judge at Camp Pendleton dismissed a murder charge against a Marine accused of killing an unarmed detainee in Iraq. The charge against the Marine, Sgt. Jermaine Nelson, was dismissed after he agreed to plead guilty to dereliction of duty. His lawyer said the agreement called for no prison time and an honorable discharge. Sergeant Nelson, 28, was among three Marines accused of killing detainees in 2004 during house-to-house fighting to recapture the city of Fallujah. One of the Marines was acquitted by a military jury of the same charges in April, and another was acquitted last year in federal court on counts that included voluntary manslaughter.1017 2009-09-30 IN HIS CAR STEREO NOW “Born to Run,” “Darkness on the Edge of Town,” “Greatest Hits,” “Live in New York City,” “Working on a Dream” and a George Strait album added at the insistence of Sheriff Kim Guadagno of Monmouth County, his running mate.ONLY TOUR HE’S SKIPPED 2004 Vote for Change tour, benefiting America Coming Together, a Democratic group supporting John Kerry’s presidential campaign. “I said to myself, I’m a Bush appointee — I’m going to wind up on the Jumbotron.”CONCERTGOING BEHAVIOR Screaming “Bruuuuce,” pumping fist, singing every word, trying to dance.LOST MEMORABILIA Scores of ticket stubs collected before 1999, when his family’s possessions were destroyed in 12 feet of water during flooding caused by Hurricane Floyd.

HALBFINGER1018 2009-09-30 The troubles with the flood insurance program offer a parallel to Congress’s grappling with how to expand access to health care, possibly through a government partnership with insurance companies.“There are certain things to be learned,” said Robert Hartwig, president of the Insurance Information Institute. “If the price charged for the service rendered does not cover the cost, you will ultimately run a taxpayer-financed deficit.”Clark Stevens, a spokesman for FEMA, said that by working through the insurance industry, the program was able to reach many more communities in a timely and cost-effective manner. The nation’s biggest insurers participate, including Allstate, State Farm, Traveler’s Insurance Companies, Liberty Mutual, Farmers and the American International Group. Many smaller and regional insurance companies also take part.In all, the program takes in about $2.3 billion in premiums a year, and lets the insurance companies retain roughly $1 billion of that amount.The Congressional auditors found that FEMA did not look at the insurers’ actual expenses when deciding what share of the premiums they could keep — even though the data has been available since 1997 from the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. Instead, the auditors found, the federal agency looked at the average expenses of companies selling five other types of property insurance.When the auditors looked at the actual costs of selling flood insurance, they found that a sample of insurers in the flood program were retaining about $327 million more than they were incurring in actual expenses, a difference of about 16.5 percent.The accountability office did not draw conclusions as to whether this profit level was too high, given that the insurers do not bear risk in the flood program. It simply stated that the government agency should be keeping better track.Without accurate expense data, it said, the government “does not have the information it needs to determine whether its payments are appropriate and how much profit is included.”Mr. Stevens said that the Congressional report was based on a small sample during a time when losses were unusually heavy.“We have concerns about the report’s central finding because it is not representative of the program as a whole,” he said.The accountability office also said that the roughly 90 insurance companies in the flood insurance program did not seem to market the flood insurance at all — they simply offered it when someone asked for it.This seemed at odds with the government’s goal of trying to persuade more people to buy flood coverage, particularly people outside the most hazardous zones. Broadening and diversifying the risk pool of customers could lower the government’s costs and protect taxpayers.Again, the accountability office faulted FEMA, saying it did not give the insurance companies any incentive to market their policies strategically. Instead of paying bonuses to insurers that brought in a more diverse group of policyholders, the federal agency has been using a broad-based formula that simply pays bonuses to companies that increase sales by 2 to 5 percent a year.“This formula primarily rewards companies that are new” to the program, the auditors wrote.The accountability office said that flood program representatives had expressed agreement with this finding and were already working on changes in the way the insurance companies are paid, which they hoped to have in place by next year.The audit report was requested by Senator Richard Shelby of Alabama, the senior Republican on the Banking Committee, which also has responsibility for insurance. An aide to the senator said he would probably support a continuation of the flood insurance program, although he was concerned that it was not actuarially sound. The program is expected to receive month-to-month extensions, starting on Wednesday, when the government’s fiscal year ends, until a broader reauthorization is approved.Before the flood insurance program was begun in 1968, most people with property in flood zones simply went without insurance. When there was a flood, people ended up relying on federal disaster relief, which was costly and poorly tailored to their needs.The flood insurance program was based on the idea that if the government was paying for rebuilding anyway, it would be cheaper and more efficient to do so through insurance.To keep the risks manageable and protect taxpayers, the program was set up to offer coverage only to property owners in communities that had floodplain management laws and enforced them, according to Douglas J. Elliott, a fellow at the Brookings Institution who has written a brief history of the flood program.And the insurance was optional.But over time, too few people were buying flood insurance — and too few communities were enforcing their floodplain rules. In 1972 Congress made the insurance mandatory for anyone who took out a mortgage from a federally regulated lender to buy property in a flood zone. In 1994, Congress added penalties for lenders that did not comply.Mr. Hartwig of the Insurance Information Institute said the efforts to make flood insurance compulsory were reminiscent of the debate today over whether Washington should force everyone to buy health insurance.“Forty years of experience found that the more people who opt into the program, the better the community is served,” he said. But people resisted.“One reason people cite is that they believe they’ll be bailed out anyway, or they say they can’t afford it, no matter how much it is subsidized. And a third reason cited is, ‘Well, it won’t happen to me,’ ” he said. “All of these are analogous to the arguments in health care.”To entice more people into the program, Congress limited the amount premiums could rise in a single year. But when real estate prices soared, so did the program’s risks. Premium revenue did not keep up, setting the program up for the financial calamity that accompanied Hurricane Katrina.After that, the program had to borrow from the United States Treasury to stay afloat. Now it is $20 billion in debt. Last year more than half of its outlays were for interest.1019 2009-09-30 Two missile attacks killed 13 people in the northwestern tribal belt on Tuesday in what appeared to be American drone strikes. One attack struck a Taliban compound in Sararogha village, South Waziristan, and killed six insurgents, including two Uzbek fighters, Pakistani intelligence officials said. Sararogha was the base of the Pakistani Taliban chief, Baitullah Mehsud, who was killed last month. A second missile hit a house owned by an Afghan militant in Dandey Darpakhel village, North Waziristan, officials said. Seven insurgents died in the attack, they said. Dandey Darpakhel is the site of a religious seminary of the Taliban leader Siraj Haqqani.1020 2009-09-30 The Securities and Exchange Commission’s independent watchdog called for a sweeping overhaul of the agency’s investigation and enforcement practices on Tuesday, after a blistering report on the S.E.C.’s failure to detect Bernard L. Madoff’s extensive Ponzi scheme.Two reports, released by the S.E.C.’s inspector general, H. David Kotz, recommended dozens of changes in the way the agency evaluates tips, trains investigators and documents examinations of securities firms. The S.E.C. has accepted the recommendations.Many on Wall Street and in Washington were surprised that some of Mr. Kotz’s proposals, like recording interviews with witnesses and creating a database for tips and complaints, were not already part of the S.E.C.’s standard practice.Representative Edolphus Towns, Democrat of New York, said the reports illustrated the “shockingly poor performance by two major S.E.C. departments.” He said the report found that more than 13 percent of the enforcement staff members said they had experienced a lack of impartiality or the appearance of partiality among their supervisors, affecting the performance of their duties. “There can be no place for partiality or political influence in our financial regulators,” Mr. Towns said.The first report, which covers the S.E.C.’s inspections and examinations office, outlines 37 improvements that would revamp nearly every aspect of the division’s operations, including how investigators follow up on tips and creating step-by-step procedures in identifying potential violations of securities laws.Mr. Kotz also issued 21 recommendations to the S.E.C.’s division of enforcement, including the start of a formal process for handling complaints and improving working relationships within the division. One measure would mandate that tips and complaints be reviewed by at least two individuals experienced in the subject before taking further action.1021 2009-09-30 Swiss diplomats on Tuesday visited three American hikers detained in Iran, a Swiss Foreign Ministry spokesman said. The three were held after they strayed into Iran from northern Iraq at the end of July. The spokesman declined to give any details of the visit. The hikers crossed into Iran by accident, their families have said. Switzerland represents American interests in Iran.1022 2009-09-30 A longstanding lawsuit involving royalties for the characters of Winnie-the-Pooh and his lovable, lucrative friends from the Hundred Acre Wood was dismissed in federal district court in Los Angeles, Reuters reported. In a legal dispute that dates to 1991, the estate of Stephen Slesinger, the producer who first acquired licensing rights to the Pooh works and characters from A. A. Milne in 1930, was suing for more than $700 million in royalties it says it was owed by the Walt Disney Company, which acquired the rights from Stephen Slesinger Inc. in 1961. When lower courts threw out that case after the misconduct of a private investigator, Mr. Slesinger’s heirs filed a copyright-infringement suit against Disney. On Friday Judge Florence-Marie Cooper ruled that Stephen Slesinger Inc. “transferred all of its rights in the Pooh works to Disney, and may not now claim infringement of any retained rights.” A Disney spokeswoman told Reuters that Stephen Slesinger Inc. still had a claim against Disney pending before patent regulators.1023 2009-09-30 Mr. Rather’s lawyers had asked the appellate court to reinstate several claims in the suit that that been dismissed by a New York Supreme Court judge, Ira Gammerman. At the same time, CBS asked the judge to dismiss the claims he had allowed to stand.The case originally included five claims. Judge Gammerman had previously dismissed three and retained a breach of contract claim and a breach of fiduciary duty claim.The appellate court voted 5 to 0 to order all the claims in the suit dismissed, saying, “The motion court erred in denying the defendants’ motion to dismiss the claims for breach of contract and breach of fiduciary duty, and therefore we find the complaint must be dismissed in its entirety.”A representative said that Mr. Rather would have no comment Tuesday. Previously he said of his pursuit of the case, “I want to go the distance.”Mr. Gold said the decision had left the Rather side “unhappy, dismayed and surprised,” adding that “the court saw the case differently than we did.”But he said he had described to Mr. Rather the option of taking the case to the Court of Appeals and that Mr. Rather had said to go forward. “I think we have a good shot,” Mr. Gold said.He acknowledged that the court did not have to accept the case, and if it did not “then it would be over.”Mr. Gold also conceded that taking the case another step meant additional expense for Mr. Rather, who by all accounts has spent heavily to pursue the suit.“I agree with that 100 percent,” Mr. Gold said, adding that filing an application to the Court of Appeals would not be a “huge undertaking” and that only if the court accepted the case would the expense grow significantly.As of last November, the cost to Mr. Rather was more than $2 million. On Tuesday, Mr. Briskman, the CBS lawyer, said he estimated that Mr. Rather might have spent as much as $5 million on the case.He and other CBS executives expressed regret Tuesday at the cost to Mr. Rather, both financially and in the damage to what had been a 44-year relationship between Mr. Rather and CBS.Mr. Briskman said that despite what seemed to him to be a convincing final victory in court, the case was tinged with sadness.“Dan was a great anchor for us,” Mr. Briskman said. “I hate the whole thing. The whole situation is pathetic. To have to fight Dan Rather is pathetic. I really wish the whole thing would just go away.”1024 2009-09-30 “This is a game-changer — the whole debate, the ball’s now in the N.F.L.’s court,” said Dr. Julian Bailes, the chairman of the department of at the School of Medicine, and a former team physician for the whose research found similar links four years ago. “They always say, ‘We’re going to do our own studies.’ And now they have.”Sean Morey, an player who has been vocal in supporting research in this area, said: “This is about more than us — it’s about the high school kid in 2011 who might not die on the field because he ignored the risks of concussions.”An N.F.L. spokesman, Greg Aiello, said in an e-mail message that the study did not formally diagnose , that it was subject to shortcomings of telephone surveys and that “there are thousands of retired players who do not have memory problems.”“Memory disorders affect many people who never played football or other sports,” Mr. Aiello said. “We are trying to understand it as it relates to our retired players.”As scrutiny of brain injuries in football players has escalated the past three years, with prominent professionals reporting cognitive problems and academic studies supporting a link more generally, the N.F.L. and its medical committee on concussions have steadfastly denied the existence of reliable data on the issue. The league pledged to pursue its own studies, including the one at the University of Michigan.Dr. Ira Casson, a co-chairman of the concussions committee who has been the league’s primary voice denying any evidence connecting N.F.L. football and dementia, said: “What I take from this report is there’s a need for further studies to see whether or not this finding is going to pan out, if it’s really there or not. I can see that the respondents believe they have been diagnosed. But the next step is to determine whether that is so.”The N.F.L. is conducting its own rigorous study of 120 retired players, with results expected within a few years. All neurological examinations are being conducted by Dr. Casson.According to a 37-page synopsis of the study furnished to the league, the researchers conducted a phone survey in late 2008 in which 1,063 retired players — those who participated from an original random list of 1,625 — were asked questions on a variety of health topics. Players had to have played at least three or four seasons to qualify. Questions were derived from the standard National Health Interview Survey so rates could be compared with those previously collected from the general population, the report said.Some health issues were reported by N.F.L. retirees at normal rates (kidney and prostate problems), while others were higher ( and elevated ) and others lower (heart attacks and ), the summary said.The researchers also asked players — or a caregiver for those who could not answer — if they had ever been diagnosed with “dementia, Alzheimer’s disease, or other memory-related disease.”The Michigan researchers found that 6.1 percent of players age 50 and above reported that they had received a dementia-related diagnosis, five times higher than the cited national average, 1.2 percent. Players ages 30 through 49 showed a rate of 1.9 percent, or 19 times that of the national average, 0.1 percent.The paper itself questioned the reliability of using phone surveys to assess prevalence rates of diagnosed dementia, as did several experts in telephone interviews. For example, some of those affected may not be reachable; then again, N.F.L. players may have greater access to doctors to make the diagnosis. The lead researcher, David R. Weir, said in an interview that proxies might have been handled differently in past studies.“This suggests something suspicious,” said Dr. Amy Borenstein, professor of epidemiology at the University of South Florida. “But it’s something that must be looked at with a more rigorous study.”Dr. Daniel P. Perl, the director of neuropathology at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York, agreed with Dr. Borenstein but described the Michigan work as significant. “I think this complements what others have found — there appears to be a problem with cognition in a group of N.F.L. football players at a relatively young age,” he said.All rates appear small. But if they are accurate, they would have arresting real-life effects when applied across a population as large as living N.F.L. retirees. A normal rate of cognitive disease among N.F.L. retirees age 50 and above (of whom there are about 4,000) would result in 48 of them having the condition; the rate in the Michigan study would lead to 244. Among retirees ages 30 through 49 (of whom there are about 3,000), the normal rate cited by the Michigan researchers would yield about 3 men experiencing problems; the rate reported among N.F.L. retirees leads to an estimate of 57.So the Michigan findings suggest that although 50 N.F.L. retirees would be expected to have dementia or memory-related disease, the actual number could be more like 300. This would not prove causation in any individual case, but it would support a connection between pro football careers and heightened prevalence of later-life cognitive decline that the league has long disputed.After the University of North Carolina’s Center for the Study of Retired Athletes published survey-based papers in 2005 through 2007 that found a correlation between N.F.L. football and depression, dementia and other cognitive impairment, a member of the N.F.L. concussion committee called the findings “virtually worthless.”After initiating a fund in 2007 that provides financial assistance to retirees receiving care for dementia, the league insisted that it was doing so only because the disease “affects many elderly people” well beyond N.F.L. players. And a pamphlet that the league gives every player about concussion risks states, “Research is currently under way to determine if there are any long-term effects of concussion in N.F.L. athletes.”“It’s time to edit that brochure,” said of the , the president of the N.F.L. Players Association. “Now it’s in their words and not just other people’s.”1025 2009-09-30 Does he regret it?He later added, “Obviously the president has enormous respect for his service and values his opinion.”General McChrystal has denied any rift with the White House, though his request for up to 40,000 more troops has created a political problem for a president whose liberal base is increasingly speaking out against the war. In an interview last week, General McChrystal emphasized that he had been given complete freedom to conduct his strategic review and troop request.“It’s very important to have a serious debate on this,” he said.The president and the commander do not know each other well. It was Mr. Gates who decided to change commanders and picked General McChrystal. Aides said Mr. Obama relied on Mr. Gates’s recommendation and did not interview General McChrystal before approving the appointment, but he did meet with him in the Oval Office over the summer.On Wednesday in the video conference, the general will get to explain to Mr. Obama the ground conditions justifying his troop request. Among those with the president will be Mr. Gates, Admiral Mullen, Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, Gen. James L. Jones, the national security adviser, and Gen. David H. Petraeus, the Middle East commander.The meeting, one of five scheduled for coming weeks, will review the situation on the ground, with new information presented in response to questions posed at Mr. Obama’s last session on Afghanistan, on Sept. 13. Later meetings will explore options, ranging from General McChrystal’s all-in approach to Mr. Biden’s scaled-back strategy focused on drone strikes and Special Forces operations.To prepare, Mr. Obama met Tuesday with the new NATO secretary general, Anders Fogh Rasmussen. General McChrystal’s troop request would require more forces from NATO, but Mr. Rasmussen was noncommittal.“I agree with President Obama in his approach — strategy first, then resources,” Mr. Rasmussen told reporters in the Oval Office. “The first thing is not numbers. It is to find and fine-tune the right approach to implement the strategy already laid down.”Mr. Obama, who has had little luck persuading the Europeans to deploy more combat forces, emphasized common ground. “We both agree that it is absolutely critical that we are successful in dismantling, disrupting, destroying the Al Qaeda network,” Mr. Obama said.Questions about Mr. Obama’s relationship with General McChrystal have percolated for weeks, following reports that the administration delayed his troop request and kept him from testifying before Congress. “Someone has to explain what the strategy is,” said Frederick W. Kagan, a military expert at the American Enterprise Institute. “I think it’s important for the American people to hear from the commander.”Administration officials said they wanted to rethink the Afghanistan strategy before addressing troop levels and maintained it would be premature for the general to testify. Nonetheless, Mr. Gates, worried about the criticism, told General McChrystal last week to send him the troop request to take the heat off the commander.Still, questions arose again after the general, responding to a reporter’s question, said on the CBS program “60 Minutes” on Sunday that he had talked with the president once since assuming command in June.Some supporters of the war said Mr. Obama had made a mistake not to consult more directly with his commander.“I don’t think I can defend him for being out of touch with his commander,” said Michael E. O’Hanlon of the Brookings Institution. “He has other people who advise him. But there’s no one else with the feel on the ground that McChrystal has.”1026 2009-09-30 Judge Dearie, citing a 12-page detention memo that the government filed last week, concluded that “there are no reasonable conditions that will ensure this gentleman’s presence or the safety of the community,” and entered a permanent order of detention, which Mr. Dowling did not oppose.Mr. Zazi did not speak during the hearing, and when it ended, Mr. Dowling squeezed his shoulder before he was returned to detention by marshals.After the hearing, Mr. Dowling, who joined Mr. Zazi’s defense team after the young man was arrested, said, “To use a hackneyed phrase, I’d like to stop this rush to judgment, because what I’ve seen so far does not amount to a conspiracy,” he said.When the single-count bombing-conspiracy indictment was unsealed in Brooklyn on Thursday, prosecutors from the office of the United States attorney, Benton J. Campbell, described in the detention memo what they said were Mr. Zazi’s efforts to make homemade explosives.At the hearing, the lead prosecutor in the case, Jeffrey H. Knox, said evidence obtained under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, which in some instances allows electronic surveillance and covert searches in counterterrorism cases, would be used in the case. The prosecutors, he said, will file a memo in the coming weeks about how they will proceed under the Classified Information Procedures Act, which governs the use of classified evidence in federal criminal cases.Mr. Knox also asked the judge to designate the matter as a complex case, saying that in addition to issues involving the translation of some materials, “the conspiracy is international in scope and we expect to have to deal with evidentiary issues and other types of issues with foreign governments.”Outside the courthouse, Mr. Dowling acknowledged that his client had traveled to Pakistan and had bought beauty products that contained chemicals that could be used to make explosives. But he said his client had not broken any laws by doing so.And while he conceded that he had not yet seen all of the government’s evidence in the case, he contended that the material detailed in the detention memo was insufficient to support a conspiracy charge, which requires that prosecutors prove Mr. Zazi entered into an agreement with someone else to commit a crime.“The government will have to produce someone else — they don’t necessarily have to indict them — or the conspiracy charge fails,” he said. “You can’t convict him of conspiracy without an agreement.”The memo, which sets out some of the evidence that the government says it will present against Mr. Zazi at trial, said that three people helped him buy beauty supplies in Denver that contained chemicals that could be used to make home-brewed explosives. Prosecutors have said that Mr. Zazi told F.B.I. agents that he received weapons and explosives training in a Qaeda camp when he traveled to Pakistan in August 2008 and that he was accompanied on the trip by an unspecified number of people.No one else has yet been arrested. But on Tuesday morning, F.B.I. agents returned to a Flushing apartment they had searched on Sept. 14, according to a tenant, after Mr. Zazi had spent the night there on Sept. 10. The agents, several of whom had been present for the initial search, took two calculators and photographed a spiral-bound notebook belonging to another tenant. One page of the notebook, in an entry dated Sept. 30, 2007, indicated that the writer had borrowed $2,000 from Mr. Zazi and was traveling to Pakistan for four months.The detention memo traced Mr. Zazi’s steps from his four-month trip to Pakistan in 2008 to his purchases in Denver. It also described what the government called his efforts on Sept. 6 and 7 to make the explosives in a Denver hotel suite’s kitchen and his subsequent trip on the eve of the anniversary of the 9/11 attacks to New York, where prosecutors said they found that his laptop computer contained a file with an image of his handwritten notes on bomb-making.1027 2009-09-30 The $8,000 first-time home buyer tax credit, passed by Congress as part of the stimulus package in February, prompted hundreds of thousands of people to buy sooner rather than later, experts estimated. The credit is scheduled to expire on Nov. 30. If it is not renewed, some prospective buyers will probably wait until better times.Analysts are troubled by the prospect of banks’ releasing another large supply of foreclosures. Distressed sales were a large reason for plummeting prices last year. Unemployment is still rising, which increases the supply of foreclosures and tends to discourage even those with jobs from buying.“The market needs to deal with these before we can declare absolute victory,” Ms. Maitland said.Some analysts think the recovery is an illusion. Joshua Shapiro, chief United States economist of MFR, said he believed the recent rise was merely a correction after the large declines of the winter, when the economy was in free fall.“We believe it unlikely that the overall price adjustment seen to date is sufficient to balance supply (which is enormous) with demand,” Mr. Shapiro wrote in a research note. He added that in the middle and upper range of the market, “there is likely plenty of pain yet to come.”The Case-Shiller numbers lag by a month the reports on numbers of new-home sales and existing home sales, both of which are already out for August. The news was not particularly good. Existing sales fell 2.7 percent after four months of gains, while new-home sales were up only marginally after strong gains in June and July.Even if the recovery holds, prices have a long way to go before they recover the ground lost in the last three years. The Case-Shiller numbers include a national index that is back to its 2003 level.On a seasonally adjusted basis, home prices in San Diego were up 2 percent in July; Los Angeles rose 1.2 percent; and San Francisco increased 2.9 percent. New York rose 0.9 percent, while Minneapolis, the best-performing city, was up 3.1 percent. Without the adjustments, which is how Case-Shiller numbers were reported until recently, the increases were all somewhat greater.The declining cities were Seattle, which fell 0.3 percent; Detroit, down 0.4 percent; and Las Vegas, which dropped 1.9 percent. Home prices in Las Vegas, which flew higher in the boom and fell further in the bust, were down by a third over the last year.In another economic report released Tuesday, the Conference Board, a private research group, said that its consumer confidence index dropped to 53.1 in September, from the revised 54.5 reading in August. Economists surveyed by Thomson Reuters had expected 57.1028 2009-09-30 “Iranian missiles are able to target any place that threatens Iran,” a senior Revolutionary Guards official, Abdullah Araqi, was quoted as saying by the semiofficial Fars news agency.The reported tests were of the liquid-fueled Shahab-3 and the solid-fueled Sejil-2 missiles, which can travel up to 1,250 miles. The test-firings recalled a debate among spy agencies in the United States, Germany and Israel over whether Iran planned to build not only a nuclear weapon but also the means to launch it.Press TV, Iran’s English-language satellite broadcaster, also quoted Mr. Salehi on Tuesday as saying the government was preparing a “timetable for inspection of its recently-announced nuclear facility.” Mr. Salehi was speaking in an interview late Monday, Press TV said. It did not say when the international weapons inspectors would be permitted to view the plant, which is not yet in operation, according to Iranian accounts.Mr. Salehi repeated Iranian assurances that the new plant will “produce enriched uranium of up to 5 percent, consistent with its nuclear energy program.” That level of enrichment is far less than required for nuclear weapons.“Salehi noted that the plant is under construction within the framework of the I.A.E.A. regulations,” Press TV said. It quoted the official as saying, “Iran has taken all the precautionary steps to safeguard its nuclear facilities.”Mr. Salehi accused Western leaders of politicizing Iran’s nuclear activities but promised that Iran would seek to resolve the dispute over the newly disclosed plant “both politically and technically” with the I.A.E.A. and with the outside powers that deal with the issue — the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council plus Germany.Mr. Salehi described as “baseless” accusations that Iran was planning to use the hitherto secret plant to make weapons-grade material. According to Press TV, he said it was “against our ethics and religion” to build nuclear weapons.“It is against our tenets, it is against our religion to produce, use, hold or have nuclear weapons or arsenal, how can we more clearly state our position? Since 1974 we have been saying this,” Mr. Salehi was quoted as saying.Despite such protestations, the Obama administration is now working to assemble a package of tougher sanctions, which could include a cutoff of investments to the country’s oil and gas industry as well as restrictions on many more Iranian banks, senior administration officials said Sunday.A spokesman for the Iranian Foreign Ministry said at a news conference Monday that Iran’s missile tests had been planned for some time and were not linked to the nuclear dispute, Press TV reported.Less than two weeks ago Mr. Obama canceled a plan from the administration of George W. Bush to station a radar facility in the Czech Republic and 10 ground-based interceptors in Poland as part of what had been described as a shield against potential missile attacks from Iran.The Obama administration now plans to deploy smaller SM-3 interceptors by 2011, first aboard ships and later in Europe, possibly in Poland or the Czech Republic.The military exercise and escalating tensions with the West coincide with a period of political uncertainty in Iran, in the aftermath of Iran’s disputed June 12 election.On Monday a protest erupted at Tehran University, the first of the new school year and the first since the demonstrations that had followed the vote, when opponents accused President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad of falsifying results.The Revolutionary Guards were essential to safeguarding the president’s victory and led the violent crackdown after the election that opposition leaders say killed at least 72 people.The force, which also runs the country’s missile program, remains close to Mr. Ahmadinejad and accountable only to the supreme religious leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.The Revolutionary Guards, in addition to being part of Iran’s military, has in recent years become one of the largest conglomerates in the country. It has been awarded more than 750 construction, oil and gas contracts and has its own ports.On Sunday, in a deal that underlined its expanding economic and political power, the Revolutionary Guards purchased just over 50 percent of Iran’s Telecommunication Company in a $7.8 billion deal.The organization’s political influence has also increased, with many of its members elected to Parliament in 2003 or appointed as cabinet ministers in 2004.Now, the Revolutionary Guards’ hold on the country’s telecommunications systems will give it further control over land-line, Internet and cellphone services. On election day, the country’s text messaging service was cut off; the cellphone network was disconnected during the unrest that followed. Opposition leaders accused the government of misusing state-run services.The deal announced Sunday was part of the government’s plan to privatize business sectors. But critics have complained that the government is awarding institutions close to it while the real private sector is excluded. The Revolutionary Guards’ unit involved in the deal competed only with a company affiliated with the Basij, a paramilitary organization that assisted the Revolutionary Guards in putting down the postelection protests.1029 2009-09-30 RENCHARD--Alice ""Dolly"" (nee Fleming), age 94, on September 26, 2009, beloved wife of the late William S.

In August, the International Crisis Group, a nongovernmental organization based in Brussels that seeks to prevent and resolve deadly conflicts, issued a report recommending that opposition groups take part in the election. It said that although the new Constitution “entrenches military power,” the changes at least established “shared political spaces — the legislatures and perhaps the cabinet — where cooperation could be fostered.”And internationally, some policies toward Myanmar, formerly Burma, are shifting.Last week, the Obama administration announced that it would engage the junta directly, while keeping sanctions in place. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton called for the unconditional release of political prisoners, including Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi, and “credible, democratic reform.”Mr. Win Tin said, “If the direct engagement of the U.S. will result in the release of all political prisoners and in a revision of the 2008 Constitution, then dialogue could begin between us and the junta, and we would consider running in the election.”Mr. Win Tin — warm, razor-sharp and clearly determined — said the reason the junta released him, shortly before his prison sentence was completed, might have been to split the party. He admitted that “we are having some arguments about whether we are going to participate in the elections or not,” but insisted that there was “no conflict within the party now.”Mr. Win Tin worked as a journalist and became secretary of the newly formed National League for Democracy before being jailed for three years in 1989. In 1991, he was given 10 more years for his involvement in popular uprisings in 1988 that were crushed by the military. In 1996, he was given seven more years for sending the United Nations a petition about abuses in Myanmar’s prisons. Much of the time, he was in solitary confinement.“I could not bow down to them,” he said. “No, I could not do it. I wrote poems to keep myself from going crazy. I did mathematics with chalk on the floor.”He added: “From time to time, they ask you to sign a statement that you are not going to do politics and that you will abide by the law and so on and so forth. I refused.”When all his upper teeth were bashed out, he was 61. The guards refused to let him get dentures for eight years, leaving him to gum his food.Last month, Mr. Win Tin was briefly detained after he wrote an opinion article that appeared in The Washington Post, criticizing the military junta and its plans for the election next year.“I think they are trying to intimidate me, to stop me from appearing in the foreign media,” he said.During the interview, on a cousin’s leafy porch in suburban Yangon, formerly Rangoon, government spies openly watched and took photographs from outside the gate.Never married, Mr. Win Tin talks fondly of his adopted daughter, who lives in Sydney, Australia, after gaining political asylum 15 years ago. He has not seen her since.Accustomed to a spare prison diet, he has one meal early in the day and a bit of fruit in the evening.“I don’t want to be a burden on anyone,” he said.Since his release, Mr. Win Tin has tried to reinvigorate the leadership of the National League for Democracy by stepping up the frequency of meetings and lobbying overseas governments. Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi remains popular, despite her long years of detention, but the party has been crippled by the arrests of hundreds of younger members, Mr. Win Tin said.“We have some young men, but they are followed and sent to jail all the time,” he said. “Sometimes, they go to the pagoda just for praying. They are followed and charged with something and sentenced.” Many are tortured, he said.In one kind of torture, called “riding the motorcycle,” the subject is made to bend the knees, stand on tiptoe with sharp nails under the heels and make the sound of a revving engine. When the subject can no longer maintain the tiptoe stance, the nails penetrate the foot.All but one of Mr. Win Tin’s eight colleagues on the party’s central executive committee are older than he is. The committee president and chairman, U Aung Shwe, is 92, and so infirm that he has not visited party headquarters for months. The party secretary, U Lwin, 87, is bedridden and paralyzed. The youngster in the group, U Khin Maung Swe, is in his mid-60s.Despite the challenges his party faces, Mr. Win Tin remains optimistic.“We expect democracy can happen anytime,” he said, recalling the country’s postcolonial democracy period from 1948 to 1962. “But sometimes, you have to sacrifice everything for a long, long time. It might extend for more than your life span.”1032 2009-09-30 SCHNEEWEISS--Samuel. The partners and staff of Becker Ross, LLP mourn the passing of our friend of more than sixty years.

The book retells Chinese history from a modern perspective, emphasizing democracy and pluralism.According to New Century’s editor, the rights activist Bao Pu, the book was originally to be published last year by the Social Science Academic Press, which is based on the mainland and affiliated with the state Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. The manuscript was edited, the cover was designed and it was being advertised online. Then it was pulled.In August, Mr. Bao and the author discussed publishing it in Hong Kong instead, and they agreed on a release date just before the National Day holiday. Less than a month ago, Mr. Bao said, he got a telephone call from Mr. Xiao.“He was under some pressure from the authorities,” Mr. Bao said.A government official went to the offices of the newspaper where Mr. Xiao worked, and his boss spoke to him about the issue as well. Mr. Xiao was warned that Mr. Bao was using him to “ruin National Day celebrations.”“It’s true that I wanted to get the book out before Oct. 1,” Mr. Bao said. “But it wasn’t to crush National Day celebrations. As a businessman, I simply timed it to when there would be the most buyers in town.“It’s strange, as a Hong Kong publisher, to be in the same sort of situation that a mainland publisher might be in,” he said. “We’re under similar pressure because I don’t want the author to get into trouble.”The two men finally decided to go forward with publishing anyway. The book came out on Friday.Mr. Bao has had considerable experience with mainland pressures. His father, Bao Tong, who was one of Mr. Zhao’s top aides, has been under police surveillance for years. Beijing tightly controls whether Bao Pu is given visas to visit his family on the mainland.One of the bigger players in the industry is Mirror Books, which was founded in Canada in 1991 and is now based in the United States. Mirror has published more than 200 volumes on Chinese politics and history.Its creator, Ho Pin, a Hunan Province native who once worked for Chinese state media, said, “Our books are the most popular secret reading materials in China.“If the Chinese government bans a book,” he said, in a telephone interview from New York, “it’s like they’re informing all of their officials that Mirror has another new title worth reading.”The mainland authorities, he said, “aren’t going to fine or arrest an individual” caught with a banned book. “The worst that would happen is that the book will be confiscated,” he said, “and it’s probably because the customs staff want to read it themselves.”'"
