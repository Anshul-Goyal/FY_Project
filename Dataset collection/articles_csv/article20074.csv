"'07-04-01,'0','TAMPA, Fla., March 31 — As a Kansas City Royal last season, Doug Mientkiewicz lobbied his manager to start on opening day against a left-handed pitcher.“I rewarded him by going out there and striking out twice,” Mientkiewicz said.In their opening game Monday, the Yankees will face Scott Kazmir, the All-Star left-hander for the Tampa Bay Devil Rays. Manager Joe Torre seems inclined to start the right-handed-hitting Josh Phelps at first base, rewarding him for a sizzling spring that included another home run Saturday.“Josh came in here and set the world on fire, and he deserves it,” Mientkiewicz said before the Yankees finished spring training with a 3-3 tie against the Detroit Tigers. “Yes, it will hurt to not start on opening day, but then again, I’ve never been on a team this good, either.”The Yankees scored 930 runs last season, the most in the majors, despite playing for months without Hideki Matsui and Gary Sheffield. They replaced Sheffield with Bobby Abreu last July, and their lineup is so deep that the player Mientkiewicz considers the team’s best hitter, Robinson Canó, will bat eighth.That is where Torre put Canó on Saturday, in a lineup that seemed to be a preview of what he may use Monday. Johnny Damon led off, followed by Derek Jeter, Abreu and Alex Rodriguez. Jason Giambi hit fifth, followed by Matsui, Jorge Posada, Canó and Phelps. In Phelps’s first at-bat, against the left-hander Mike Maroth, he hit his fourth spring homer. Phelps beat out Andy Phillips for a roster spot by hitting .395.'"
"'07-04-01,'0','But some lawmakers were dismayed that they would be asked to vote on thousands of pages of legislation that they could not possibly have time to read, with Republicans on the Assembly floor loudly objecting to the process Saturday night.Governor Spitzer did prevail on several key policy objectives. Lawmakers agreed to expand Child Health Plus, a state-financed insurance program for children, to families earning 400 percent of the federal poverty level. The change would make the aid available to virtually all of the 400,000 uninsured children in the state, lawmakers said. They also took steps to simplify bureaucratic hurdles to make it easier for parents and guardians to enroll children and keep them covered.Senate Republicans dropped their opposition to a state false claims act that would provide substantial financial incentives to state or local government workers, or other citizens, who blow the whistle on government fraud. Democrats portrayed the act as a critical tool in reining in fraud in the state’s sprawling Medicaid plan. The Senate Republicans had said it would lead to too many lawsuits.Legislators were also expected to approve a $600 million fund for stem cell research, a high priority of the governor.Governor Spitzer also kept in place nearly $1 billion worth of proposed Medicaid cuts. He relented, however, on $356 million more in cuts, mostly to hospitals and nursing homes, after a fierce fight with the health care lobby, which engaged him in a bruising media and advertising campaign. The sides continued to dispute who won and who lost.“We’ve covered enormous ground, in terms of policy,” the governor said late Saturday. “We are getting every kid insured — health insurance. We’re getting stem cell research. We’re getting a false claims act. We’re getting charter schools. We’re getting the sorts of reforms that had been long thought impossible.”The agreements reached in the past week were hammered out almost entirely behind closed doors by the governor and leaders of the Legislature. As a result, many of the details will not be clear to rank-and-file lawmakers until well after the budget is passed, and at least some of the dollar numbers could shift.A couple of Mr. Spitzer’s proposals were rejected in late negotiations on Saturday, including judicial pay increases and $1,000 tax credits for parochial school tuition. Talks also stalled on a proposal favored by Assembly Democrats to require that New York City use a certain amount of its new school aid to reduce class sizes. The measure was opposed by Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, and it appeared to be moderated into something closer to a suggestion instead of a requirement, people with knowledge of the negotiations said.Lawmakers did agree to double the number of charter schools to 200, with up to half of the new ones to be created in New York City.The governor also compromised on his plan to halt $328 million of unrestricted municipal aid payments to New York City, agreeing instead to restore $20 million in the fiscal year that begins on Sunday and the full amount in the following year.The state will spend on the order of $1.8 billion more on education aid this year, a significant increase. The governor had proposed to send substantially more aid to New York City schools to resolve a lengthy legal battle that the Campaign for Fiscal Equity, an education advocacy group, fought with the state.But the governor’s plan to wipe out the complicated and politically fraught education aid formula, by which “shares” of aid have been distributed around the state, met with fierce resistance from Long Island Republicans in the Senate.The deputy majority leader, Senator Dean G. Skelos of Nassau County, said the new proposal would lead to a sharp reduction in aid to his constituents.In the end, the governor agreed to add roughly $400 million to his original proposal.“The people on the Island are going to benefit, when they were disenfranchised in the original proposal,” said the Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno, the state’s top Republican. “That’s thanks to the Republican majority, Senator Skelos and the others, and no one else, and that’s a fact.”The governor and the legislative leaders also agreed to send $1.3 billion worth of property tax rebate checks to homeowners next year, in addition to an existing $3.6 billion the state sends to local governments to reduce property tax bills.The governor won on one of his major priorities, to direct that aid to the middle class, but the Senate forced him to include a wealthier mix of people. The total amount of relief also was less than either side had initially proposed.The largest rebate checks are intended for homeowners with incomes of up to $120,000 downstate and up to $90,000 upstate. New York City residents also are to receive a modestly increased credit on their city income taxes, which are the main source of school financing in the city.The overall budget weighed in at $120.9 billion, including federal funds, according to the latest estimate, though the numbers tend to be re-estimated daily late in budget negotiations.Though that number grew only slightly from Mr. Spitzer’s $120.6 billion executive budget, the Legislature added more than $1 billion worth of new state spending, which was offset by shrinking federal aid.State spending is projected to rise to $84 billion from $77.3 billion, an increase of 8.7 percent. That is well beyond a 2.6 percent inflation rate projected for the state.The final package will use up additional tax revenue that the state was expecting as a result of a relatively prosperous economy; the governor had hoped to set aside more of that money for reserves.“I think that there is going to be a lot of heavy lifting to do next year,” said Elizabeth Lynam, deputy research director of the Citizens Budget Commission, an independent watchdog group.“They achieved some cost control in Medicaid, although not enough, and in school aid, they managed to shake up the dialogue about shares and move off the shares concept to some degree, but there are still issues with the formulas that will need to be tackled,” she said.She and other analysts have also been concerned about the property tax rebate checks, which will greatly expand a system that has not appeared to accomplish the desired effect: keeping soaring property taxes in check.“They are building on a broken foundation,” Ms. Lynam said.Some of the governor’s initiatives were taken off the table by legislative leaders, including his proposal to expand nickel deposits to bottles of water, iced tea and sports drinks and to raise $100 million by keeping unclaimed deposits. Currently, grocers and bottlers keep unclaimed deposits. A number of observers were troubled by the lack of transparency in the budget process this year, even by the standards of Albany, which is known for secretive deals. This year, public budget negotiating sessions in the Legislature were largely relegated to rubber-stamping agreements behind closed doors.“I hope that as we go forward there will be a process that will be more open,” Governor Spitzer said. “We all want that.”The governor waived the required three-day waiting period between printing bills and voting on them. That meant that lawmakers would not have time to read the stacks of budget bills before voting on them.“Whatever bad things the Legislature wants to do probably would not withstand the light of day, but there is no light of day,” said Edmund J. McMahon, director of the Empire Center for New York State Policy, a conservative policy group.The Assembly minority leader, James N. Tedisco, a Republican, said Saturday night that “it won’t be a reality budget because nobody’s going to be able to read it,” adding that he planned to vote against most of the budget.Mr. McMahon and other observers said they were puzzled that Governor Spitzer seemed willing to cut deals to get a budget approved on time, instead of holding out for broader reforms.“He backed off the brink there and I’m not quite sure why,” Mr. McMahon said. “Basically, he leaves a lot of unfinished business. He talked about turning around a battleship; I think the battleship is wedged in dry dock.”The governor, for his part, cited the quick transition required in New York, where new governors must submit their first budget at the end of their first month in office. He said that such a brief period did not permit time for the sort of analysis his office would be able to do next time.“I believe if you look at the time frame we had,” Mr. Spitzer said, “we did very well.”'"

It sickens us, it bothers us — but local folks ought not to be punished.”The schools superintendent of Monahans, Keith Richardson, said closing West Texas State, which employs 228 people, could mean the loss of 60 students in Monahans schools because their parents would have to move if they lost their jobs there.Mayor David Cutbirth of Monahans said the job loss would damage the area’s economic diversity, which is tied to oil and gas production.“Drilling jobs can pay up to $28 per hour, but they’re mostly for men,” he said. West Texas State offers jobs for clerical workers, teachers, counselors and men “with special training.”Pyote now houses 238 offenders ages 12 to 20, with most ages 15 to 17, said a Texas Youth Commission spokesman, Jim Hurley.When a reporter visited the facility, groups of young men clad in orange or blue marched in drill formation from the cafeteria to classrooms. The youngsters wear uniforms to signify their phase of “resocialization,” Mr. Hurley said. He said the youngsters’ days were structured: “They go to school, to therapy groups, behavior groups, meals, exercise and recreation, physical training, and a hour of free time in the evenings. They are up at 5 a.m. and in bed at 9 p.m.”Nearly 4,000 youthful offenders are being held in 36 Texas Youth Commission facilities.A Ward County grand jury will meet on April 10 to consider the accusations against the former officials of West Texas State who, according to a Texas Ranger investigation, “engaged in sexual contact with several students.”In recommending the closing of West Texas State, the auditor cited Pyote’s remote location, its sparse labor force and its distance from medical facilities.Judge Holly said he understood that all but 10 percent of the jobs at the Pyote facility were filled, “while some other Texas Youth Commission facilities have 20 to 30 percent openings.” He pointed out that Odessa, with several hospitals, is just 40 miles away on Interstate 20. “In time, that’s as close as any metropolitan area prisons,” he said.Sixty percent of West Texas State counselors and teachers drive the 15 miles from Monahans (population 6,700 with an additional 2,000 outside city limits), and 40 percent from Pecos (population 9,000), 26 miles to the west, Mayor Cutbirth said.Bob Siekman, a former teacher and a retired contractor, said that he lived next door to West Texas State and that he considered the detention center a good neighbor. Mr. Siekman blamed “the muckety-mucks, the higher-ups” for any misconduct there.But he was more interested in pointing out that Pyote has a museum, open on weekends, devoted to the town’s earlier fame as the World War II “Rattlesnake Bomber” Air Force base, which in 1952 was temporarily home to the B-29 Enola Gay, which had dropped the atomic bomb on Hiroshima.“I climbed all over the Enola Gay when I was a kid,” he said.'"

I don’t want to jinx myself.”But Stoudemire, 24, made a proclamation that could reverberate in the playoffs. “I think I’m better than what I was two years ago,” he said.'"
"'07-04-01,'0','Before the bans on smoking and on cooking with trans fats, there was Prohibition. Whatever the theoretical merits of banning the sale of liquor back then, a case could be made that unlike recent decrees by the health police, Prohibition unfairly — and intentionally — singled out Catholics, Jews, immigrants and New Yorkers.In “Dry Manhattan: Prohibition in New York City” (Harvard University Press, $28.95), Michael A. Lerner, associate dean of studies at Bard High School Early College in Manhattan, convincingly makes that case.Perhaps he sometimes overstates New York’s role as the “foremost battleground” over Prohibition, and the extent to which the temperance movement spawned a local backlash that helped elevate Alfred E. Smith and Franklin D. Roosevelt into national politics. And “Dry Manhattan” can be occasionally just a tad too dry, even for a book published by an academic press.But Mr. Lerner exhaustively and effectively illuminates some of the relatively obscure or forgotten sidelights of America’s so-called “noble experiment,” among them: “curiously insular” New Yorkers’ arrogant miscalculation of the clout of the Anti-Saloon League; the dimensions of the return of some immigrants to Europe, where they could drink again unmolested; and the reasons Tammany Hall was so dependent for its survival on the local tavern.He also profiles some of the largely unsung protagonists of the era, including Pauline Sabin, a Morton Salt heiress who reversed herself and supported repeal, and William H. Anderson, the hero of Prohibitionists, against whom Tammany had the last laugh — he was later convicted of forgery and sent to Sing Sing.In 1848, Washington Irving was the executor of John Jacob Astor’s estate. Imagine how this literary figure who wrote about history as burlesque would have covered the melodrama involving Astor’s heirs today.Andrew Burstein’s engaging biography is titled “The Original Knickerbocker” (Basic Books, $27.50), and to aid readers who might mistake his subject for a pair of short pants or a brand of beer, he serves up three subtitles: “The Life of Washington Irving,” “Ambassador, Biographer, New York Politico and Acclaimed American Storyteller” and “How the Legendary Author of ‘Sleepy Hollow’ Shaped a Nation.”There! Must be something worth reading about. And so there is.Professor Burstein, a native New Yorker and a history professor at the University of Tulsa, artfully weaves together Irving’s many vocations in a book that reads much more smoothly than some of Irving’s own.Irving was a biographer of Washington and Columbus and the man who conjured up his caricature of Colonial Dutch aristocracy, the legendary New York raconteur and historian Diedrich Knickerbocker of the family from Scaghtikoke, “where the folk lay stones upon the houses in windy weather, lest they should be blown away.”Irving also helped popularize Santa Claus and, of course, his special version of Rip Van Winkle. “We are all curious to know how life will go on without us,” Professor Burstein writes. “Rip found out.”Don’t look for excessive evenhandedness in “Facing Fascism: New York and the Spanish Civil War” (N.Y.U. Press, $27.95), a collection of largely nostalgic essays by writers and academics. The evocative photographs in this book are black and white. In retrospect, at least, the war, fought by, among others, surrogates for Hitler and Stalin, seems more defined by shades of gray.But readers don’t necessarily have to agree totally with all the premises in this book — including E. L. Doctorow’s, that the war “was essentially a clear contest between an elected government trying to extricate its people from a feudal social system, and a privileged class intent on preserving it” — to revel in an era 70 years ago when global politics seemed much simpler.“That the war was pervasive in the city’s consciousness I know,” Mr. Doctorow writes, “because as a 5-year-old, I had more than once answered the doorbell to find someone collecting money for ‘Spanish War Relief.’ ”This collection of essays is being published in conjunction with an exhibition through Aug. 12 at the Museum of the City of New York (and in collaboration with the Abraham Lincoln Brigade Archives and the Instituto Cervantes).Michael Yamashita’s “New York Flying High” (White Star, $24.95) is like soaring over the city on a perfectly clear day. Even better. In the photographer’s lavishly illustrated book, you can linger, enjoying the vista without vertigo, and view rare close-ups of aeries like rooftop water tanks atop tall buildings, and the Statue of Liberty’s crown.“From above, Manhattan makes sense,” Elizabeth Bibb, a former magazine editor and Mr. Yamashita’s wife, writes in the accompanying text, “its over 50 unique neighborhoods, from SoHo to Harlem, follow a logical schematic plan, like Mondrian’s ‘Boogie on Broadway’ come to life.”THE WORLD IN MY KITCHENThe Adventures of a (Mostly)'"

The Smithsonian museums cannot sustain their well-deserved reputation unless they are fully financed.In choosing the next secretary, the Smithsonian’s governing board — the regents — should select a person who is bold enough to push for a wisely constructed, tiered admission fee.The new secretary must persuade visitors that the quality of the experience merits a modest charge.

"'07-04-01,'0','WHEN overseeing consumer focus groups of high school students, Steve Hedlund pays closer attention when the deeper voices start talking. “Teen girls, they’re too polite” to say they don’t like a product, said Mr. Hedlund, vice president for growth and innovation at Master Lock, based in Milwaukee. “It’s always the teen boys that are the litmus test.”So he was pleased with the adolescent male reaction to the G.l.o., a new combination padlock with an incandescent dial. The boys, Mr. Hedlund said, raved about the illuminated product, despite its much higher price — more than twice that of Master Lock’s traditional combination locks.A glowing lock had been on Master Lock’s drawing board since the late 1990s. But light-emitting diodes were too expensive at the time, and the company’s locks were too small for the necessary circuitry.Mr. Hedlund said the company’s basic combination lock, virtually unchanged since the 1950s, had been designed to be “as compact and cost-efficient as possible.” As a result, there was little or no unused space in the lock’s body.In 2003, however, Master Lock, a unit of Fortune Brands, introduced the Sphero, a dome-shaped combination padlock. It could be opened with one hand — a perk, said Mr. Hedlund, for students laden with books. A convex dial that extends all the way to the lock’s edges created space inside the lock — room that Master Lock’s designers realized could be stuffed with L.E.D.’s, which were finally inexpensive enough to be included in mass-market products.The company first experimented with a lock whose L.E.D.’s were activated by an on-off switch. But that approach was soon dropped in favor of piezoelectricity — a system that produces voltage when mechanical force is applied. In the G.l.o.’s case, two copper plates are agitated by the turning of the dial, producing an electrical current.'"
"'07-04-01,'0','Gov. M. Jodi Rell may think Connecticut’s most pressing problem is poor education, and the Democrats who control the Legislature may think it is lack of universal health care. But the main problem is the high cost of living and working in Connecticut, which is driving out both residents and jobs.Connecticut’s education spending per student is among the highest in the country, and Connecticut students outperform the national average. The percentage of Connecticut residents without health care is below the national average. Despite these factors, Connecticut has one of the slowest-growing populations in the country, and has been rapidly bleeding industrial jobs.Will more education spending help? Ohio increased education spending and tax rates massively in the last decade in response to a court order. The increase in tax rates contributed to an economic slowdown. Massachusetts is struggling with significant cost overruns in its new universal health care scheme, with young and healthy people with moderate incomes being pressured to leave the state by mandatory insurance policy costs that are as much as twice what was promised by the Legislature.The governor and the Legislature should avoid tax increases that could reduce the state’s economic competitiveness, and work to reform existing spending before seeking to spend more money.“Debate Rages on UConn Hospital Expansion” (March 18) quotes Dr. Peter J. Deckers, the University of Connecticut’s executive vice president for health affairs and dean of the School of Medicine, as saying, “Health care is a business, and we have just as much right to be competitive as anyone else.”Dr. Deckers neglects to consider an important detail: he wants UConn, a state entity, to compete and lure business away from the private community hospitals in the area by using taxpayers’ money. Indeed, most of the debt financing for the proposed UConn project would come from state bonding, thus crowding out funding for other priorities, such as education infrastructure, as proposed by Gov. M. Jodi Rell in her budget.The encroachment of government-sponsored business ventures into the domain of established private enterprise has been a taboo in our society, and it should remain that way.'"

"'07-04-01,'0','Barnaby Barford spends most of his working life in a shed in his East London garden, surrounded by cheap figurines — the banal ones you get for pennies from charity shops or on eBay, the ones with nothing to recommend them, the ones that nobody wants. Well, nobody except Barford. In the hands of this 29-year-old product designer, ceramicist, teacher and artist, these found objects are transformed into one-off collector’s pieces — works of art, really, sold in London through the David Gill Galleries or at the major design fairs.Barford collects the figurines, cuts them up, reassigns bits of them — a head here, a body there — and then repaints them to create something entirely different, like part of a mirror or a chandelier. “Oh, I Thought it Would Be Bigger,” for example, is a centerpiece for a table composed of twoimpeccable women, one of whom looks exactly like C. Z. Guest, staring at a large, well-endowed black stallion.“This one arrived from eBay,” Barford says about one of the female figures, “and I hated her at first. But all the figurines I use are ugly in one way or another. They tend to be mass-produced in China, and most people would dismiss them on principle, but I like making them nice. Even just painting the horse black makes a difference. Often people think I’ve made everything from scratch, but I’m not interested in that.I like transforming a dowdy figurine into something else.”It’s impossible not to call Barford’s output art. David Gill, who deals mostly in furniture and decorative art, says of Barford’s work:“It is poetic, colloquial and punchy. For me, he is a sculptor and an artist working in the same tradition as Grayson Perry.” (Perry, who won Britain’s prestigious Turner Prize in 2003, also used to show his work with David Gill.)But Barford’s work is wonderful design as much as it is art: even the most decorative pieces — the table centerpieces — have a purpose, while still functioning as satire. His piece “Well I Think He’s Done a Cracking Job!” shows a naked woman, a white poodle’s head where her own should be, twirling on a gold ball in front of a mirror and looking at herself admiringly. Titles are clearly important to Barford, who can pinpoint the exact moment he first discovered the cartoons of Ronald Searle.'"
"'07-04-01,'0','Is all of this indicative of a broader shift in the politics of health care? Perhaps. As health care has become more expensive and even middle-class Americans have become anxious that their hold on employer-sponsored coverage is precarious, politicians have been talking seriously again about making health insurance a birthright, just as it is in every other developed nation. Not long after Wyden unveiled his plan, former Senator John Edwards, who is running for president, offered a detailed universal-coverage proposal of his own. His chief rivals for the Democratic nomination, Senators Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama, have pledged to insure all Americans. Meanwhile, Mitt Romney of Massachusetts signed a statewide universal law last year before leaving the governor’s office; his campaign for the Republican nomination now proclaims it his major policy achievement. Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, another Republican, has proposed a similar system for California.But it is corporate America’s interest that is most striking. For many years, the only business leaders openly calling for universal coverage were mavericks like Howard Schultz, the chairman of Starbucks, who has long preached the need for business to show greater social responsibility. The C.E.O.’s rallying to universal coverage now — particularly in the last few months — are acting not so much out of social solidarity as out of financial necessity, as the burden of financing workers’ premiums has become ever more onerous.“The refrain from business was, ‘We can’t afford to do universal health care,’ ” says Wyden, whose plan calls for shifting responsibility for buying insurance from employers to individuals. “Now the refrain is, ‘We can’t afford not to do it.’ ” The Business Roundtable, one of Washington’s most influential business lobbies, now endorses universal coverage, at least in broad principle. And probably no spectacle captured the spirit of the times more than a joint conference held in February by Andy Stern and a man he has spent much of the last few years attacking, Lee Scott, the C.E.O. of Wal-Mart. Together the two pronounced the need for universal coverage by 2012.Of course, at that news conference, Scott didn’t go into great detail about exactly what kind of universal health-care system he would like, just as the Business Roundtable shied away from specifics in its statement. And that’s the rub. In the early phases of the last great debate about health-care reform, during the early 1990s, prominent business leaders sent out strikingly similar signals — suggesting they were ready to embrace universal health care, for the same essential reasons they cite now. At one point, a coalition of business leaders put out a “play or pay” proposal that would have required corporations either to insure their workers or to pay into a common fund for the uninsured. But as President Clinton’s health-care plan lost political momentum, the business community’s support for universal health care faltered and, eventually, collapsed. Is its support any more reliable now? “This is precisely the political equation the Clintons bet on,” says Jonathan Oberlander, a health-policy scholar at the University of North Carolina. “Sorry to say this may turn out to be another mirage.”Burd, who like most successful business leaders does not lack self-confidence, vows to see this campaign through and to bring his fellow C.E.O.’s along with him. Veteran universal-coverage supporters like Stern and Wyden who have worked with Burd say they think it’s possible he will do just that. But even they concede that Burd’s ideas — and more generally, the ideas of the business community — don’t line up perfectly with their own. How far can such a coalition go? And, no less important, where will it go?The first calls to create what we now know as universal health care date back to the early 20th century. Before then, medical care was generally cheap because it was, for the most part, ineffective. As one scientist put it, “It was around 1910 or 1912 when it became possible to say that a random patient with a random disease consulting a random doctor stood better than a 50-50 chance of benefiting from the encounter.” But by the 1920s, medical advances — in particular, the refinement of anesthesia and the development of sanitary techniques — enabled doctors to cure patients rather than simply comfort them. As medicine grew more sophisticated, however, it became more expensive. Particularly after the Depression set in, large numbers of people could no longer afford to pay for medical care on their own. Many went into debt. Others simply didn’t get the care they needed.Franklin Roosevelt ended up rejecting calls to incorporate health insurance into the New Deal; he is thought to have feared that the opposition of organized medicine might sink his Social Security Act. As a result, the inability of patients to pay for their medical bills remained a problem — not just for the patients but, increasingly, for the providers as well. Having spent the boom years of the 1920s building up their facilities, hospitals faced a serious financial crunch with the onset of the Depression. To improve their prospects of being paid by patients, they created the nation’s first group-insurance plans. These plans evolved into the Blue Cross system and eventually became the model upon which all health insurance would be based. Among the most important characteristics of these plans was that they were linked to employment: in order to spread the cost of caring for the sick, hospitals pitched the plans primarily to groups of employees — a method that brought in enough healthy people to subsidize the cost of the sick or injured.By and large, leaders of the business community in the middle of the century embraced this change. Given their staunch opposition to government interference in the private sector, Blue Cross-style insurance seemed the least-objectionable solution to the medical-cost problem. And during World War II, when the government exempted fringe benefits from its strict controls on wages, employers started offering ever more generous health benefits in order to attract workers. Another government decision — to exempt group health insurance premiums from personal income taxes — made health insurance an even more attractive option for business to offer. This effectively made a dollar of insurance worth more than a dollar of income, giving companies an easy way to cement worker loyalty.During the postwar era, with widespread prosperity helping to create relatively good relations between management and labor, C.E.O.’s frequently spoke of themselves as stewards of their employees’ well-being — a claim consistent with their role as the country’s primary sources of insurance. But by the 1970s, improved technology and increasing demands for it (spurred, in part, by the creation of Medicare) sent the cost of medicine skyrocketing. Meanwhile, America’s manufacturing sector faced intense competition from producers abroad who paid considerably less for labor than their American counterparts. As insurance became more expensive, businesses started looking for ways to limit the burden. Often, they succeeded — which is one reason the proportion of Americans without insurance climbed in the late 1980s and early 1990s, setting in motion the Clinton health-care episode.Though it is not widely remembered, Clinton tried hard to curry favor with business. Ira Magaziner, the chief architect of the administration’s plan, met repeatedly with corporate leaders to seek their advice, understand their needs and anxieties and test their tolerance for various provisions. Although the final White House plan included an “employer mandate” — meaning all businesses would be required to pay for a portion of their employees’ health-care costs — Clinton constructed that mandate so that many employers would actually benefit: For example, the automakers and other large employers obligated by union contracts to provide generous benefits would get some financial relief. Even businesses that didn’t offer such generous benefits would at least enjoy more predictability, since contributions to a government-administered fund would fluctuate a lot less than existing private-insurance premiums. The mandate would have the hardest impact on the country’s small businesses, since so many were not providing any sort of health insurance at all. But the Clinton plan had subsidies for these establishments too. Given all this, why didn’t business support the Clinton health plan?Actually, there was some support — at least initially. Most notably, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce at first embraced the concept of an employer mandate. But when the chamber, which represents both big and small companies, announced its endorsement, it came under attack from the National Federation of Independent Businesses, which represents only small firms. The chamber quickly started to lose members — and to field irate calls from Republican legislators warning against giving any support to the Clinton plan. The chamber and other allies backed off.Following the plan’s demise, the most influential leaders of the business community assumed a strongly oppositional stance to virtually any health-care reform that involved more regulation or spending, no matter how modest. In 1998, when Congress considered passing a law that would regulate the practices of H.M.O.’s, both the Chamber of Commerce and the National Association of Manufacturers joined a coalition that spent $1 million fighting the measure. One of the coalition’s advertisements featured a Frankenstein figure — and a warning to Congress: “Be careful how you play doctor. You might mandate a monster.”It was during the Clinton-era debate over health-care reform that Burd made his first foray into politics as Safeway’s C.E.O. In 1993, well before Clinton unveiled his full plan, Democratic lawmakers interested in building support for universal coverage invited a group of corporate leaders — Burd among them — to visit Washington. During a brief discussion on Capitol Hill, Burd acknowledged that, yes, he thought universal health care was probably a good idea, because his supermarkets spent so much money on their worker benefits and because universal coverage, done right, might bring some relief. As Burd retells the story, no sooner had the C.E.O.’s finished talking than the legislative staff threw open the doors — ushering in a flood of reporters and cameras for a news conference. Apparently the other participants knew this was coming, because they had prepared statements. Burd didn’t. So he just spoke extemporaneously when his turn came, saying more or less what he had a few minutes earlier. His comments made the next day’s papers, but aside from taking a few follow-up calls, Burd says he didn’t play much of a role in the political drama that followed. Instead, he watched the coming political train wreck from afar and concluded that there wasn’t much a C.E.O. could do in that political environment.Within a few years, however, Burd found himself thinking about health care all over again. Like many companies, Safeway received temporary relief from rising insurance costs during the mid- and late 1990s, as insurers began using the techniques of managed care — restricting patients to certain doctors and bargaining harder on prices from hospitals. But those huge managed-care savings vanished once insurers squeezed out the obvious waste; once consumers rebelled against H.M.O. restrictions; and once doctors and hospitals consolidated into groups with more bargaining leverage. By the late 1990s, premiums started rising at their old rates again. It became all too apparent that if businesses wanted to hold down the cost of employees’ health insurance, simply herding everybody into managed care plans wasn’t going to do the trick.Of course, not all businesses faced the same difficulties. Health-care costs had long been an overriding concern for heavily unionized companies obligated to pay lifetime health benefits to generations of retirees. The Big Three automakers liked to say these “legacy costs” added more than a thousand dollars to the cost of every new car, making their products effectively uncompetitive with foreign rivals. And although this was something of an old story — the former Chrysler C.E.O. Lee Iacocca was warning about health care’s impact back in the 1980s — the problem had magnified over the years. Uwe Reinhardt, a Princeton economist, has described the Big Three automakers as “a social insurance system that sells cars to finance itself.”Safeway, certainly, had no comparable burden. But as a low-margin business — profits in the grocery industry tend to run between 1 and 3 percent of revenues — it was still very sensitive to rising benefit costs. (Burd likes to refer to the grocery chains as occupying the lowest decks of a leaking ship; as the hull starts to fill with water, they’re the first ones to notice.) And while Safeway wasn’t directly threatened by competition from abroad, it had become extremely worried about one very big competitor at home: Wal-Mart.If G.M., with its lavish insurance, represented the quintessential industrial-age employer, Wal-Mart was a prototype for doing business in the postindustrial era. Its work force was nonunionized (thanks in no small part to the company’s staunch resistance) and, as such, it could get away with offering less insurance to fewer workers than companies like Safeway. In late 2003, after Wal-Mart announced that it would take its new superstores into California, the big supermarket chains said they had no way to compete with Wal-Mart’s bargain-basement prices without heavy concessions from their workers on benefits. Although the union argued that Safeway was merely using Wal-Mart as an excuse to reduce benefits, the eventual settlement of the ensuing strike gave Burd much of what he wanted. In a new, two-tier benefits system, new employees had to wait longer for benefits and, even then, were not promised the same plan as existing employees. In other words, Safeway’s insurance would start to look just a little more like Wal-Mart’s.Burd had a freer hand to tinker with the benefits of his nonunion employees — the supervisors and corporate administrative personnel who make up about 15 percent of the company’s 200,000-person North American work force. Here he simultaneously adopted two approaches. Instead of offering employees virtually full coverage, Safeway followed the lead of other corporations that were introducing plans with higher deductibles — and lower premiums. By encouraging employees to “put some skin in the game,” as the saying went, business hoped workers would become shrewder — and more frugal — consumers of health care.But that was just Step 1. Step 2 was to develop a comprehensive wellness program for the workers. Burd, who is 57, is something of a fitness nut, thanks in part to personal circumstances: With a family history of early heart attacks, he ran on a treadmill every day, lifted weights twice a week and meticulously watched his diet. A high-school baseball player, he took special pride in his leadership of the corporate softball team. But he was even more proud that he’d been keeping his cholesterol level below 135.Burd said he thought that if his employees adopted the same habits, they’d be healthier, too. And healthier employees, he’d come to learn, didn’t run up such high medical bills. Burd had never been shy about offering Safeway employees advice about how to behave — in 1998, he famously encouraged his workers to be more cheerful, even setting up a one-day training program that employees mocked as “smile school”; soon he began feeding his employees a steady diet of healthful-living propaganda, through speeches and newsletters. He also introduced screening and counseling for chronic disease, whose treatment inevitably constitutes the bulk of health-care spending. Enrollment in the screening program was strictly voluntary, but those who joined got breaks on their insurance premiums. And just to make sure employees didn’t skimp on preventive care in order to save some money — a common hazard of higher-deductible plans — he exempted such treatments from the deductibles and effectively made them free.Burd says the results were impressive: in 2006, the first year of full implementation, employees who enrolled in the newer plans, with the greater individual cost-sharing, had their personal health-care bills drop by 20 to 30 percent, while the company’s health bill for those employees shrank by 11 percent. (It is unclear what happened to the costs of people who stayed in the old plan.) But Burd soon realized that corporate cost-cutting had its limits. Over the years his interest in wellness had led him to become a major supporter of disease research. In conversations around the Bay Area, he heard over and over from hospital administrators about the financial burden the uninsured were placing on their facilities — a burden that eventually rippled through the insurance system and showed up on Safeway’s bottom line as inflated health premiums.Burd’s first effort to trim costs and keep Safeway competitive involved cutting back on health benefits. Then he tried encouraging his workers to be healthier. Could nationwide universal health care simply be the next step? As long as there were large numbers of uninsured, Burd reasoned, there would be no solution to his company’s — or the country’s — problems with affordable care. And that, he says, is when it finally dawned on him: Maybe this was a problem the company couldn’t solve on its own. If he wanted relief from employee health costs, the government would have to help.It was not an idea that came easily to Burd, a self-described conservative and Republican; in his office, a “Bush 2000” baseball hat sits in a glass display case. But when Burd came to Washington and started talking about his company’s problems with health care, it was Wyden, a Democrat, who seemed most interested in working with him.Ultimately, the bill that Wyden and Burd produced is powerful evidence that an alliance including liberals and conservatives, labor and management, can produce meaningful legislation. According to the Lewin Group, a well-respected health-care consulting firm, the Wyden plan would achieve universal health insurance in a financially sound way. Families’ costs would vary depending on their medical expenses and the insurance plan they chose, but on average those making less than $40,000 would end up with a little more money than before. Those making more than $40,000 would end up with a little less money, although they’d also get more choice of plans, better benefits and the knowledge that they could never lose their coverage.Wyden is quick to share credit for the plan with Burd, particularly when it comes to what is arguably its most significant provision: the severance of the longstanding relationship between where you work and how you’re insured. Under the Wyden proposal, most Americans would still use private insurance. But they would not get that coverage through employers anymore. Instead, all employers that offer insurance would “cash out” their benefits — in effect, giving their employees higher wages rather than health benefits. Once that was done, people would be required to buy coverage on their own, directly from insurers. (Wyden’s plan leaves enforcement to the states. Some have suggested that schools could require proof of insurance before enrolling children, and uninsured adults could be penalized on their tax returns.) The federal government, in turn, would closely regulate the insurance offerings to make sure all policies provided certain minimum benefits — Wyden has initially set those benefits to match existing Blue Cross-Blue Shield plans. Under Wyden’s plan, the federal government would also make sure those benefits were available to everybody at the same rate, regardless of pre-existing medical conditions. Finally, the government would offer subsidies to people too poor to buy insurance on their own, phasing out Medicaid.Wyden says Burd initially thought that mandating relatively generous benefits was a mistake; it reminded him of those policies he’d replaced at Safeway. But to Wyden’s pleasure, Burd didn’t insist he strip down his plan. In turn, Burd was pleased to see Wyden promote healthful behavior. In order to finance the subsidies for the poor, Wyden’s plan calls for a tax on businesses, pegged to a firm’s revenues and size. Companies that now provide relatively generous employee benefits would likely end up paying slightly less under the plan, while companies that don’t would likely pay more. And even though employers would no longer be insuring their employees, they would get financial incentives to set up wellness and fitness programs, while employees would get insurance discounts for enrolling in them.Although Wyden says he thinks there’s a chance his bill, or something like it, could pass this Congress, most experts believe a serious effort to achieve universal health care won’t take place until after a new president takes office in 2009. Then Wyden’s plan could well become a starting point for the discussion, particularly since it represents a variation on the most-talked-about health-care reform idea of the moment: the “individual mandate,” so called because it “mandates” that “individuals” buy private insurance just as individuals with cars are mandated to buy private auto insurance. (In some individual-mandate schemes, people can still enroll in public programs like Medicaid if they are eligible.) Mitt Romney and Arnold Schwarzenegger made the individual mandate the foundation of their universal-coverage plans.It’s no great mystery why some businesses might like an individual mandate. It gets them out of the business of insuring their workers while relieving them of most, if not all, of the financial liabilities associated with health care. In addition, it levels the playing field among companies that have been generous and companies that haven’t — in effect, taking away Wal-Mart’s ability to undercut Safeway by skimping on worker benefits. No less important, an individual mandate does all of this without asking the government to assume direct responsibility for providing most Americans with health care — which is what would happen if the U.S. instead adopted what is known as a “single payer” system. Indeed, that’s usually the punch line of Burd’s pitch to corporate audiences: If business doesn’t coalesce behind a universal scheme that’s based on private insurance, he warns them, frustration with the status quo will produce a backlash that results in single-payer.Of course, some experts would argue that, strictly on the merits, a single-payer system might actually work better. Unlike plans like Wyden’s that rely on private insurers, a single-payer plan substantially reduces the amount of money spent on administration, since insurance companies spend far more on overhead (and marketing, and profits) than public systems. And while the data on medical outcomes are notoriously uneven and hard to interpret, they don’t show that the United States provides uniformly better care than single-payer nations like Canada or France. In fact, on measures like “Disability Adjusted Life Expectancy,” which social scientists use to measure the performance of national health-care arrangements, single-payer systems actually seem to perform slightly better on the whole.Insofar as the advocates to Burd’s left are eager to achieve universal coverage any way they can — even if it means adopting what they consider an imperfect model — none of this may matter. “We’re ready to have a very bipartisan solution,” Andy Stern said. “What you are seeing now that you didn’t see in 1994 is that everyone is on the same side saying, ‘We want universal coverage.’ The only question is, How?” But some of Burd’s fellow members of the business community are another matter. Like Burd, they believe forcing workers to take on higher deductibles and more responsibility for their health care decisions is a good strategy for controlling costs. Unlike Burd, they’re not necessarily so committed to subsidizing preventive care or providing benefits as generous as Wyden’s plan. And they are certainly not that enthusiastic about government doing more — even if it’s a plan that preserves a large role for private insurance. “We should not forget there is another way out for companies besides government intervention,” says Jonathan Oberlander, the health-policy scholar. “Cut back on coverage, hold down wages and shift costs to workers.”Then again, maybe Burd doesn’t have to bring along all of corporate America, with its many and sometimes conflicting interests, in order to make a difference. Maybe it is enough for him simply to give the idea of universal health care greater respectability — to give it the imprimatur of businessmen, who, after all, are typically the kinds of people most suspicious of such grandiose interventions in the first place. And if Burd is acting for reasons that largely reflect his corporate sensibility rather than a sense of social responsibility, even the most passionate advocates for universal coverage say they can live with that. “Unfortunately, simply making this a moral issue hasn’t worked,” Andy Stern says. “Making it clear that this is a competitiveness and jobs issue, as well—that is what has propelled the business community into this discussion.”Besides, Safeway’s bottom line is not the only thing on Burd’s mind these days. As he has gotten more deeply into this campaign, he has talked increasingly about the health-care crisis as a threat to competitiveness — one in which the future of the entire American economy hangs in the balance. At the same time, the health-care problem lately — and unexpectedly — acquired a personal resonance. Burd’s own son, a recent college graduate, now runs a small fitness company. Like Burd, he works hard to keep in top physical shape. But because he injured his back a few months ago, and received cortisone treatments for it, insurance carriers have been turning down his insurance applications.Most likely, Burd’s son will be just fine. One of the perks of being a nationally prominent C.E.O. is that you tend to know other C.E.O.’s, including those who run insurance companies. Burd has sent off a few pointed inquiries, and, he told me with a grin, he’s pretty sure one company or another will find a way to write a policy for his son. But Burd has also taken note of the experience: it’s just one more sign that American health insurance doesn’t work the way it should. It may not offend his morality, but it certainly offends his sense of efficiency. If that’s what makes him such an influential supporter of universal health care, his newfound allies in the fight aren’t going to complain.'"
"'07-04-01,'0','In other words, Schilling does not believe that the 20-game winner is being threatened with extinction. “I think there’s a lot more good pitching in the game now,” he said.Tom Glavine of the Mets echoed the thought that last season was an aberration.“I’m not saying you’re going to have 10 20-game winners this year,” he said, “but you should see a few. I’m sure last year some pitchers could have won 20, but they had some tough games or the bullpen lost it for them. There are just too many talented pitchers out there not to see it again.”But Schilling noted that pitchers didn’t go as far into their starts as they used to, reducing their chances of receiving credit for a victory.“Guys go six, seven innings, and when they come out, there’s a third of the game left,” he said.The culture of pitching has changed over the years. Gone are the days, as recently as in the mid-1970s, when pitchers worked 300 innings a season, started every fourth day and often finished what they started.“I don’t think it’s as much a statement about starting pitchers as the way baseball is run today,” said Rick Peterson, the Mets’ pitching coach.When the Baltimore Orioles had four 20-game winners in 1971, they started 142 of the team’s 158 games, and three of them worked 282 or 292 innings and pitched 18 to 21 complete games. But that quartet, Pat Dobson, Jim Palmer, Mike Cuellar and Dave McNally, was one of the last four-man rotations.Concerned for the health and well-being of their pitchers’ arms, teams began pampering their pitchers, giving them an extra day of rest by inserting a fifth starter. Worse, they eventually applied more restrictions, installing a pitch limit that magically became 100.Beyond that count, teams concluded, many, if not most, pitchers became more hittable and also risked injury. Organizations put in those restrictions in their minor league systems so that young pitchers would reach the major leagues thinking all they had to do was pitch five or six innings and they had done their job.“You have guys who aren’t throwing 70 or 80 pitches in the minors,” said Andy Pettitte, the Yankees’ veteran left-hander.Donnelly said: “It used to be if you’re tired, you’re coming out. Now you get around 100, you’re coming out. How many innings can you fit into 100 pitches? I think everybody is overprotective.”With teams constantly complaining about a lack of pitching, always searching for capable starters and overpaying mediocre pitchers, it would make sense to revert to the four-man rotation.But teams are paying pitchers so much that they don’t want to risk injury and pay them that money while they sit on the disabled list.So pitchers start fewer games, pitch fewer innings and have fewer chances to win 20.“You don’t see too many pitchers throwing complete games,” said Santana, a two-time Cy Young award winner who once won 20 games. “Now teams are built different from the past. You have bullpen guys, you got a setup man, you got a closer. Once you’re out of the games, there’s nothing you can do. It’s up to your teammates to do their job.”Nevertheless, he said, 20-game winners are not an endangered species.“One thing I can tell you,” said Santana, who completed one of his 34 starts last season. “We’re not animals. So I don’t think there’s any danger.”Pettitte, who won 21 games in 1996 and in 2003, wasn’t certain which way the trend would go, but said: “I still think you should have one or two. Guys are still getting 35, 36 starts, the guys who lead the league, so you have to think if you get enough of those guys, you’re going to get guys that win 20. But it’s definitely getting rare.”Asked if pitchers still considered winning 20 games special, he said: “Of course it’s special. It’s a number as a starter you’d love to get to. I won 19 twice and had a couple of shots at 20 and wasn’t able to get it. It’s definitely disappointing if you have a chance to get to 20 but you’re not able to do it.”Ron Guidry, Pettitte’s pitching coach, won more than 20 games three times in his career with the Yankees. He also led the league with 21 complete games in 1983.“I don’t know if there are as many quality guys as you used to have, but I don’t think it’s endangered,” he said. “I just think last year was probably one of those freak years. We had a good chance to have one. One game sticks out in your mind that Wang should have won, in Washington when we didn’t have anybody to help him in the bullpen because the bullpen was dead.”With Mariano Rivera unavailable after having pitched in the previous two games, Wang entered the ninth inning with a 2-1 lead and gave up a one-out, two-run home run to Ryan Zimmerman. Although that game was in midseason, on June 18, it could have deprived Wang of being the only 20-game winner in the majors.Peterson, the Mets’ pitching coach, is not surprised at the scarcity of 20-game winners. “I would say yes,” he said, answering the endangered-species question, saying that circumstances had made it more difficult for even premier pitchers to win enough of their starts to get to 20.Peterson said pitchers had to win two-thirds of their starts to have a shot at 20, and he asked how many starters had a career winning percentage of .667 or better. Of those with 20 or more victories, the answer is three — Pedro Martínez, Roy Oswalt and Wang.Chances are, even they did not have apple fights in their youth.“I hit Raymond Paine with an apple right in the middle of the forehead,” Donnelly recalled. “I also hit him with a clinker. I’ll bet these guys don’t know what a clinker is.”Nor did his listener. “I was raised in an alley,” the 60-year-old Donnelly said. “They would deliver coal for the furnaces, and waste would come out and there would be a clinker, a rock. We had rock fights all the time. These guys never had an apple fight or a rock fight in their life. I’ll bet all the no-parking signs in their neighborhoods are clean.”'"
"'07-04-01,'0','WHAT had he done? My mother first told me they had mistaken him for someone with the same name. (And there is, in fact, an organized crime figure with his name.) After his arrest led to his detention, however, my mother conceded that he’d done something wrong, but she wouldn’t tell me what.Regardless, our lives were turned upside down. The F.B.I. took my father to New York, and my mother followed to arrange for his defense, while I was sent to live with my aunt in North Miami Beach. A parade of character witnesses testifying to my father’s honest work as a carpet cleaner finally led to his release a year later.I didn’t learn of his release until my parents showed up in Florida on my aunt’s doorstep, which was the best surprise I have ever received and remains my fondest memory of my parents. I was 6 years old.We stayed in Florida for a few months until my father, who had gotten a job as a line cook, could save enough money to take us back to California. When we returned, we kept on the move, living over the years in Garden Grove, El Toro, Lake Forest, Mission Viejo, Laguna Hills, Aliso Viejo and Laguna Niguel. The nature of our cocoonlike existence led me to trust only my parents, to look only to them to tell me who I was and to feel fearful and disloyal for seeking outside comfort. My parents’ mantra, drilled into me, was, “Never tell our business to strangers.” And I didn’t.But I wasn’t even sure who we were or what our business was. Until I was 5, I knew our last name to be Cassese, but then my parents told me our real last name was Mascia. Cassese was the surname of a prison buddy of my father’s. I knew my father both as John, his real name, and Frank, his father’s. During our brief time in Houston, he had apparently gone by Nicholas.The day after I graduated from high school, we packed our belongings into a U-Haul and moved to New York, where my father had friends who could get him work. He joined a painting crew, earning $100 a day, leaving my mother and me with nothing to do for the summer but drive around Long Island in a car that was soon to be repossessed, talking. After one of these drives, I broke down in tears, recalling the anguish of the day my father was arrested. “I deserve to know what happened,” I told her.At my insistence, she finally opened up. She began by telling me the real story of how she and my father met, which was not “through friends,” as had been their story, but at the Fishkill Correctional Facility in New York, where my father had been incarcerated for “racketeering.” My mother was a high school English teacher with a humanitarian bent, who visited prisons, hoping to write a book about the prison reform movement. My father was among the inmates she interviewed.Their interviews gave way to animal attraction, and when my father was paroled a few months later, they started dating. Within a year they married and moved from New York to Miami, so he could escape his previous life of crime. But after I was born, he went back to his old partners and their sources of income: bulk marijuana and cocaine sales in the Port of Miami.When I was a year old, my father was arrested on cocaine possession charges. The authorities didn’t yet know he had violated his parole and mistakenly let him out on bail. And the second my parents stepped outside, my father said to my mother, “If we stay here, I’m going to end up dead or in jail. I’m running. You coming?”“Of course,” she answered. It would prove to be the defining moment of her life, and mine.And so, as she explained, it was that act — skipping out on bail and then crossing state lines — that led to my father’s being arrested by the F.B.I. in California five years later.Which was the truth, but not, as it turned out, the whole truth.A year after my mother and I had this conversation, when I was in college, I read a newspaper article about a woman who had searched an online database for criminals who had been shuffled through the New York State Corrections Department. One afternoon I found the site and typed my father’s last name into the search field. His record appeared, and I was able to verify that it was the right John Mascia. The birth date matched. I scrolled down the page past his identification number to a table listing “crimes of conviction.” And there it was, the real act that had bound the three of us together.I sat silently as my center seemed to drop through the floor.By then my father was dying of lung cancer, and in his remaining time I never told him what I had learned. For my whole life he had tried to protect me from his darkest secret, and I didn’t feel able to broach it with him now.It took me days to confront my mother, who mostly reacted with concern that my father’s awful past was available to anyone with a modem.A year later my father died. At the memorial service I stood and eulogized him, declaring: “My parents and I are soul mates. We are cut from the same cloth, and nothing, not even death, can change what we mean to each other. The type of bond we have transcends death. It exists, even today, even in this very room.”I meant it. But what I didn’t fully appreciate then was that my parents were the true soul mates, bound by ugly crimes. As a child, I had always felt their united front against the world — and sometimes me — but I didn’t know why until last winter, when my mother had a stroke and was close to dying herself. When she emerged from her haze, she somehow felt compelled to tell me the rest. “Your father did some bad things after he got out of jail, Jenny.”No. Was it possible he had repeated the crime that put him away in the 1960s and ’70s? “Tell me,” I said. “Was it...?”“Four, maybe five,” she said sheepishly.“It was after you were born,” she continued. “It was a part of that life. He was doing a job, and one of the byproducts of that job was to do what he did.” She went on to explain that his victims were fellow drug dealers, as if that made it more palatable.No matter. The horror of my father’s legacy was too much to bear. I fled, sobbing. Nineteen days later, my mother suffered a heart attack and died.I never reported my mother’s rambling deathbed confession to anyone. I knew so little. The crimes, if true, were more than 25 years old. My parents were gone, and I wanted their past buried with them. Or so I told myself.I have since marveled at my mother’s choice to stay with my father and to defend him, though, of course, I loved him, too, albeit in ignorance. He and my mother were all I had, and although my mother was deceitful and overbearing, she was also my best friend. If I didn’t tell her about something, it felt as if it hadn’t happened.In her final days, after the heart attack had sapped her strength and left her nearly brain dead, I ducked into a bathroom in the intensive care unit and saw myself in the mirror, and that’s when I felt it. Not a crack, but a slow tearing of the fiber that connected us. I stood in the unforgiving fluorescent glow, and I saw that for the first time I was standing alone. I was 28, and I could no longer look to my parents to tell me who I was. I had outlived their past, and now it was up to me to create a new future.THE bad was still with me, of course, but so was the good. A few days after my mother’s death, I was snooping on her computer and found three unnotarized wills languishing among various e-mail messages and letters she had saved. In each she gave me detailed instructions on how to extract cash advances from her credit cards, betraying her larcenous streak to the end. After those instructions, to my utter surprise, was this:“Dear Jenny: I loved you very much. I was astonished that at my age I could have had such a lovely, funny, beautiful child. Your father and I both loved you very much. I hope you know this, that in spite of imagined or real hurts, and all the times we were separated or fought with you or with each other, that we showed you that love. We three were a family, a real one that sat down to dinner together, and explored and traveled together, even if we didn’t go to the Grand Canyon.“Wherever I am, even though I am not a believer, I know that part of me will belong to this earth somewhere. And thus part of the earth will always remember and love you.”'"

This week, on Saturday, the former Microsoft engineer who oversaw the creation of the “Word” and “Excel” software programs is scheduled to depart on a roughly 12-day orbital flight to the International Space Station on a Soyuz TMA spacecraft, along with two cosmonauts. Having paid about $25 million to Space Adventures, a privately owned space tourism company, Mr. Simonyi will become the fifth civilian space tourist to pay for the out-of-this-world experience.Mr. Simonyi will not only orbit the earth at approximately 17,500 kilometers per hour, he will also assist in space station research and share a six-course meal — prepared by the French chef Alain Ducasse from a menu chosen by Martha Stewart — with the crew. Mr. Simonyi’s Web site and blog (www.charlesinspace.com) is already loaded with images (including a hilarious video of him doing weightless exercises in the zero G simulator), and has a “Kid’s Space,” with a link where children can pose questions about space travel.Space Adventures (www.spaceadventures.com) also offers zero gravity and centrifuge training at more down-to-earth prices — $3,500 and $7,795 respectively. Or for a mere $100 million per seat you can become part of the first private expedition to the moon. Like its destination, though, it is still a long way off.'"
"'07-04-01,'0','La Fresh Group in Ontario, Calif., a new sister company to Diamond Wipes, which makes moist towelettes for the restaurant industry, has developed a line of travel wipes dubbed Travel Lite on the Go. The new line, which consists of everything from nail polish remover pads to those dental finger mitts, comes in boxes containing six wipes for $3.99 and $4.99 as well gift boxes of 48 single pouches for $18 to $25; www.lafreshbeauty.com.Pitotubes, developed by Alisa Driscoll, a former flight attendant, are clear, refillable bottles small enough to meet the carry-on limit but also durable enough, she says, to place in checked baggage without concern for leakage. The bottles, holding a half to two and a half ounces, cost $10 each or $51.95 for a set of six; www.pitotubes.com.The new products are appearing at a time when reports of lost, delayed or damaged luggage have increased sharply, in large part because more people have been checking their bags in response to the carry-on restrictions. Airlines mishandled 8.19 bags for every 1,000 passengers in January, compared with 6.93 for every 1,000 in January 2006 and 6.73 for all of last year, according to data released last month by the Bureau of Transportation Statistics.Some airlines are pleading with travelers to start carrying their bags aboard again. Continental has been posting a notice on its Web site that states, “Our Overhead Bins Are Lonely” and tries to persuade travelers that bringing bags onboard helps “avoid lines at the check-in counter and waiting at baggage claim.”Others have begun to charge passengers for checking more than one bag. In February, Spirit Airlines imposed a $10 fee for checking a second bag. And coach-class travelers to and from some destinations on British Airways are now limited to a single checked bag weighing no more than 23 kilograms, or just over 50 pounds, with an extra bag costing as much as £120, or $238 at $1.98 to the pound. The baggage restrictions are all the more reason for travelers to carry on. But some say that finding the right toiletries is a hassle and that enforcement is inconsistent.Karen Anderson, a 1K passenger on United (the airline’s most elite frequent-flier level), has been using a clear plastic bag for her toiletries that she picked up at Los Angeles International Airport several months ago. “I like it because it is cute, has LAX printed on it and has a handle so I can readily pick it up out of my cosmetic case,” she said. Though she readily admits that it is a couple of inches longer than the required quart-sized zip top, she was careful not to fill it to capacity and carried it without problems through security at many airports, including Heathrow, until she was stopped at McCarran International Airport in Las Vegas in February.A Transportation Security Administration agent “made a federal case out of the fact that the bag was oversize,” said Ms. Anderson, 65, from Morgan Hill, Calif. “She loudly pronounced that this was Las Vegas, not Los Angeles. She pulled me out of line to continue the harassment, including announcing that she was sure I had forbidden items in it. I did not.”Ms. Anderson, who carries a Ziploc bag as backup, offered to transfer her toiletries into that. “I was not allowed,” she said. “She made another agent do it.” In the end, everything fit in the Ziploc, and Ms. Anderson was released with all her toiletries intact. But the incident left her steamed. “Some of these people are on such a power trip that they do not care if they are imposing conditions that make no sense,” she said.WILL the new products pass muster at the airport? I contacted the Homeland Security Department to find out. In an e-mail response, Carrie Harmon, a spokeswoman, said that while the Transportation Security Administration “doesn’t endorse any specific liquid/gel products, bottles or bags,” any kind of clear bottle is O.K. as long its capacity is three ounces or less. “If a bottle is not marked,” she added, “it’s at screener’s discretion as to whether it’s three ounces or less. So it’s better to have bottles that are marked.” Clear plastic bags with zipper tops are also O.K. as long as they are the designated one-quart size. Tablets and wipes don’t count as liquids or gels, so they don’t have to be in the one-quart bag. Go to www.tsa.gov for more details on what’s allowed and what isn’t.Travelers can find toiletries and packing goods designed with the new carry-on rules in mind at www.minimus.biz, which specializes in travel-size and trial-size items.Of course, if travel regulations change, instant shave gel and other newfangled goods could become outmoded. For now, however, Ms. Harmon said, “It is unlikely that we will make changes to the liquid/gel ban in the near future. These changes represent a long-term, sustainable level of security for the T.S.A., passengers and our aviation partners.”'"

"'07-04-02,'1','Justice Stevens, joined by Justices Anthony M. Kennedy, David H. Souter, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen G. Breyer, said that by providing nothing more than a “laundry list of reasons not to regulate,” the Environmental Protection Agency had defied the Clean Air Act’s “clear statutory command.” He said that a refusal to regulate can be based only on science and “reasoned justification,” adding that while the statute leaves the central determination to the “judgment” of the agency’s administrator, “the use of the word ‘judgment’ is not a roving license to ignore the statutory text.”The court decided a second Clean Air Act case today, adopting a broad reading of the Environmental Protection Agency’s authority over factories and power plants that add capacity or make renovations that increase emissions of air pollutants. In doing so, the court reopened a federal enforcement effort against the Duke Energy Corporation under the Clean Air Act’s “new source review” provision. The vote in the second case, Environmental Defense v. Duke Energy Corp., No. 05-848, was 9 to 0.The two decisions left environmental advocates exultant. Many said they still harbored doubts about the federal agency and predicted that the decision would help push the Democratic-controlled Congress to address the issue. Even in the nine months since the Supreme Court agreed to hear the case, Massachusetts v. Environmental Protection Agency, No. 05-1120, and accelerating since the elections last November, there has been a growing interest among industry groups in working with environmental organizations on proposals for emissions limits.Dave McCurdy, president of the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, the main industry trade group, said in response to the E.P.A. decision that the alliance “looks forward to working constructively with both Congress and the administration” in addressing the issue. “This decision says that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency will be part of this process,” he said.If the decision sowed widespread claims of victory, it left behind a prominent loser: Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., who argued vigorously in a dissenting opinion that the court never should have reached the merits of the case or addressed the question of the agency’s legal obligations.His dissent, which Justices Antonin Scalia, Clarence Thomas, and Samuel A. Alito Jr. also signed, focused solely on the issue of legal standing to sue: whether the broad coalition of states, cities and environmental groups that brought the lawsuit against the Environmental Protection Agency four years ago should have been accepted as plaintiffs in the first place.This was the issue on which the coalition’s lawsuit had appeared most vulnerable, given that in recent years the Supreme Court has steadily raised the barrier to standing, especially in environmental cases. Justice Scalia has long been a leader in that effort, and Chief Justice Roberts made clear that, as his statements and actions in his prejudicial career indicated, he is fully on board Justice Scalia’s project.Chief Justice Roberts said that the court should not have found that Massachusetts or any of the other plaintiffs had standing. The finding “has caused us to transgress the proper — and properly limited — role of the courts in a democratic society,” he said, quoting from a 1984 decision. And, quoting from a decision Justice Scalia wrote in 1992, he said: “This court’s standing jurisprudence simply recognizes that redress of grievances of the sort at issue here is the function of Congress and the chief executive, not the federal courts.”Chief Justice Roberts complained that “today’s decision recalls the previous high-water mark of diluted standing requirements,” a 1973 decision known as the SCRAP case. That was an environmental case that the Supreme Court allowed to proceed on a definition of standing so generous as to be all but unthinkable today. “Today’s decision is SCRAP for a new generation,” the chief justice said, not intending the comparison as a compliment.The majority addressed the standing question by noting that it was only necessary for one of the many plaintiffs to meet the three-part definition of standing: that it had suffered a “concrete and particularized injury,” that the injury was “fairly traceable to the defendant,” and that a favorable decision would be likely to “redress that injury.”Massachusetts, one of the 12 state plaintiffs, met the test, Justice Stevens said, because it had made a case that global warming was raising the sea level along its coast, presenting the state with a “risk of catastrophic harm” that “would be reduced to some extent” if the government undertook the regulation the state sought.In addition, Justice Stevens said, Massachusetts was due special deference in its claim to standing because of its status as a sovereign state. This new twist on the court’s standing doctrine may have been an essential tactic in winning the vote of Justice Kennedy, a leader in the court’s federalism revolution of recent years. Justice Stevens, a dissenter from the court’s states-rights rulings and a master of court strategy, in effect managed to use federalism as a sword rather than a shield.Following its discussion of standing, the majority made short work of the agency’s threshold argument that the Clean Air Act simply did not authorize it to regulate greenhouse gases because carbon dioxide and the other gases were not “air pollutants” within the meaning of the law.“The statutory text forecloses E.P.A.’s reading,” Justice Stevens said, adding that “greenhouse gases fit well within the Clean Air Act’s capacious definition of air pollutant.”The justices in the majority also indicated that they were persuaded by the existing evidence of the impact of automobile emissions on the environment.The agency itself “does not dispute the existence of a causal connection between man-made gas emissions and global warming,” Justice Stevens noted, adding that “judged by any standard, U.S. motor-vehicle emissions make a meaningful contribution to greenhouse gas concentrations.”Justice Scalia, in his dissenting opinion, disputed the majority’s statutory analysis.The decision overturned a 2005 ruling by the federal appeals court here.'"
"'07-04-02,'1','The company’s three founders also benefited from the subprime wave, collectively cashing in on more than $40.5 million in profits from selling shares in the company between 2004 and 2006, according to an analysis by Thomson Financial. They made millions more in salaries, bonuses and perks over the years.While there had been warnings in the industry for years that it was growing too big, too fast, the first real cracks began to emerge last fall as some subprime lenders began reporting increased rates of delinquencies among recent borrowers. Soon, smaller subprime lenders such as Ownit Mortgage, began filing for bankruptcy protection.Still, it seemed to come as a shock to investors when, in February, the company said it would have to restate its earnings for the first nine months of 2006 and record a loss for the final quarter because it had understated the damage caused by a growing number of soured loans.The news last month was much more dire when the company disclosed that federal prosecutors and securities regulators were investigating stock sales and accounting errors at the company.While it is still unclear who the target of those investigations are, the company said that as far as the executives were concerned, their sales occurred as part of planned stock sales. At the end of last year, the three founders still owned a combined 7 percent of the company.The company’s stock, which traded at $31.59 a share at the end of last year, was delisted by the New York Stock Exchange in mid-March, and its shares closed down $1.55 on Friday to $1.66 in the over-the-counter market.And the numerous Wall Street banks that had once provided credit lines of more than $17.4 billion began denying access to that credit. In recent weeks, the company was unable to stop many of those banks from repossessing or selling the collateral that backed those debts, making a bankruptcy filing virtually inevitable.'"
"'07-04-02,'1','Rolen smacked Heilman’s one-out pitch up the middle for what seemed like a sure single. Playing to the right of his normal position, Valentín reacted immediately, diving to his right to spear the sharp grounder. He flipped the ball to José Reyes, who stepped on second base and threw to first for the double play.“The only way I can make that play is playing where I was playing,” Valentín said. “He hit that ball so hard that I felt it in my fingers when I caught it.”During the hour-long pregame ceremony, the actor Billy Bob Thornton announced the players — in the Mets’ case, only their starting lineup, to Paul Lo Duca’s displeasure — and Cardinals players drove past their trophy in a motorcade. From the beginning, it was a different kind of opening day for the Mets, although not much has changed for them since that brisk October night when the Cardinals won the N.L. pennant.The Mets’ infield is still intact, as is two-thirds of the outfield and most of the starting pitching. Their bullpen is remodeled, featuring four newcomers, including Joe Smith. A sidearming right-hander, Smith made his major league debut in the eighth inning, but Manager Willie Randolph revisited the familiar formula of Heilman and Billy Wagner to close out Glavine’s performance.Making his eighth opening-day start, Glavine says he still becomes nervous after all these years. He stayed calm before the game by munching on a bowl of Cheerios and watching golf. Until the sixth inning, his only sign of frustration came when he could not figure out how to turn on a clubhouse television.To that point, Glavine had allowed three base runners: two were erased on double plays, and the other was tagged out on a botched suicide squeeze attempt. And then, after Alou’s diving catch, the Cardinals rapped three consecutive hits off Glavine. The third, a Preston Wilson single, sizzled up the middle to Beltrán, who, noticing David Eckstein touching third base, threw home in one breathtakingly fluid motion. The ball popped into Lo Duca’s mitt as David Eckstein was sliding into him.“I didn’t have to do nothing,” Lo Duca said.Glavine’s control, so pinpoint during the first five innings, had seemingly vanished. He walked Pujols. He hit Rolen to load the bases. The crowd, practically silent since the third inning, roared as Molina stepped to the plate. Glavine jammed Molina with a cutter, and the soft pop-up settled into Reyes’s glove in shallow center. That was the last batter Glavine faced.“I wasn’t totally thrilled with it, but the good part was that I made good pitches when I had to and got some ground balls,” Glavine said.The Mets’ offensive woes last October had everything to do with the Cardinals’ second-tier pitchers, Jeff Suppan and Jeff Weaver, and nothing to do with their ace, Carpenter, whom they tagged for seven runs in two N.L.C.S. starts. After setting down the first five hitters Sunday, Carpenter started struggling, allowing two hits in the second that preceded the Mets’ two-run third.With one out and Lo Duca on first, Beltrán waited on a 76-mile-an-hour curveball and launched it a few feet foul of the right-field pole. He was hit by Carpenter’s next pitch, putting runners on first and second for Carlos Delgado. Since returning from a five-day paternity leave, Delgado has had four at-bats against major league pitching, more than enough, he said with a smile Saturday, to be ready for the opener. He stayed back on an 0-1 changeup and poked it the other way, off the left-field wall for a two-run double.In the fourth, as Carpenter continued to labor, Green and Valentín hit consecutive one-out singles. Glavine bunted over Green, and Reyes walked. Lo Duca followed by waiting out a seven-pitch at-bat, lining a bases-loaded single up the middle to drive in two runs. Beltrán followed by shooting a sharp grounder up the middle to score another run, increasing the Mets’ lead to 5-0.As the fans shifted in their seats, dumbfounded at what was happening to their world champions, the Mets whooped it up in the dugout. They made it through one pregame ceremony and have another to go Tuesday, when the Cardinals will receive their rings. Again, they will notice but not pay it much mind.“Maybe when the season ends, that’ll be us next year,” Glavine said.'"
"'07-04-02,'1','Inside the Ball Park Lanes and the adjoining Ball Park Sports Bar & Grill on River Avenue, workers hung last-minute advertisements for domestic beers as the manager, George Diamantis, stood behind the shoe rental counter and surveyed the job.“When the season starts, more business, more customers,” Mr. Diamantis said tersely with an impatient grin. “What can I say? I’m excited to have the Yankees back.”Mr. Diamantis said the business also made money by checking bags for stadiumgoers, who have been restricted since Sept. 11 from taking them into the stadium.Business owners in the area agreed that opening day was one of the biggest business days of the year. Out-of-towners and homegrown baseball fans pack the area and spend their money in surrounding businesses.But the owners also said that baseball fans could be a fickle bunch and that booms and slumps in business had as much to do with winning or losing as with which teams the Yankees were playing and when. A game versus the Boston Red Sox is always a big game; so are cross-city battles with the Mets. Low draws tend to be teams from the Midwest or those with bad records.Others said the Bronx’s gritty or dangerous reputation kept some game attendees from shopping in the area at all.The future for many shop owners on River Avenue is uncertain, with the new Yankee Stadium to open for the 2009 season. The new stadium, to be built next door, is expected to have a bolstered commercial space inside.Many business owners fear that that commercial space will greatly hurt their ability to attract customers and that this season may be one of their last good ones.The subway riders they have snagged for decades walking past the shops to the stadium will soon be dropped off right at the new stadium. And there will be bigger souvenir shops and places to eat inside.But for Mr. Dituri, there is no time to look too far into the future when there are shish kebabs and sausage to grill.He stood in front of his little shop and took a deep breath, enjoying what he said could be the last bit of calm and sanity he will experience between that very moment and the start of the season.'"
"'07-04-02,'1','Mr. Berman, an affable Republican from East Texas, says that Mexico is the world’s most corrupt country and that its citizens are infecting us with their law-breaking culture and with tuberculosis and leprosy. He has many friends in the Capitol, which is nobody’s idea of an immigrant-amnesty zone.But the convictions gripping him have been eclipsed by something deeper in the Texas soul.That would be business.Mr. Swinford said he had consulted the state attorney general and concluded that most of the immigration bills would not survive court scrutiny. Never mind that some sponsors were well aware of their bills’ technical flaws and were itching to attract lawsuits anyway. Mr. Swinford clearly had no appetite for crusading or grandstanding, and decisively put a lid on things.“We’ve got business to do,” he told me. “We can’t be fighting and get our business done.”He was talking about efficiency. But his words could have been taken from the mouths of the powerful Texas Republicans who have entered the debate squarely on the side of comprehensive reform — that blend of border toughness and pro-immigrant fairness that Republicans elsewhere deride as “amnesty.”The story dates to last year. It has to do, as Megan Headley wrote in The Texas Observer, with pro-business Republicans realizing that anti-immigrant fervor “threatened to purge Texas of the workers that pluck chickens, build houses, and make some people very rich.”Their attention was grabbed last April, when a Democratic representative, Rafael Anchia, tacked a provocative amendment onto a bill raising business taxes to finance property-tax relief. It would have forbidden employers to cut their taxes by deducting wages of illegal workers.Mr. Anchia wanted to send the message that any crackdown on illegal immigrants would be met, blow for blow, with bills going after their employers.That got Mr. Anchia a visit from Bill Hammond, president of the Texas Association of Business, one of the state’s most powerful lobby groups. An alliance was born.Mr. Hammond is now standing beside the likes of the American Civil Liberties Union, the National Council of La Raza and the Equal Justice Center as a member of Texas Residents United for a Stronger Texas, or Trust.The group recently sent the Legislature and governor a 15-point statement of principles on immigration reform. It urges economic development in Texas and in Latin America. It argues for cultural diversity, bilingual education and in-state tuition for illegal immigrant children. And it denounces enforcement bills of the sort piled up by the dozen in Austin.Mr. Swinford represents an agricultural district with a lot to lose from attacks on immigrant labor. (It’s home to a Swift meat plant recently raided by federal agents.) But he insists he did not stifle any bills at the behest of big business.Maybe not, but he has certainly made it happy. The same week that Mr. Swinford announced that the problematic bills in his committee would die there, like the hoof-and-mouth cattle slaughtered in “Hud,” Mr. Hammond stood with Mr. Anchia on the Capitol steps to unveil an ad campaign urging Congress to pass comprehensive immigration reform, including a path to citizenship.The ads were created by another new alliance, Texas Employers for Immigration Reform, which includes the Texas Association of Business and executives like Bo Pilgrim, the Pilgrim’s Pride chicken magnate. Its Web site, www.txeir.org, makes some of the staunchest arguments for comprehensive immigration reform you’ll ever hear from rich Republican donors and power players.This Texas pragmatism has not taken hold elsewhere. Not in Washington, where Republicans are laying out hard-core positions against “amnesty.” Not in states like Georgia, Florida and South Carolina, which are steaming ahead with harsh agendas.But here, at least for now, powerful forces have come to understand — whether through warm feelings for workers or, more likely, cold self-interest — that in attacking immigrants, Texas is attacking itself.'"

Yet big sponsors have evaporated, and officials announced that Junior Miss would end in 2005, before state and local volunteers demanded its resurrection.Fewer than 6,000 girls — all juniors in high school — will participate in 2007, down from 12,000 in the 1990s, said Becky Jo Peterson, the executive director of America’s Junior Miss, the national program, which is based in Mobile, Ala.“Life in general is more shallow, and we’ve been pressured to do the swimsuits and to be the glitz and glamour,” Ms. Peterson said. “We’re not going to do that.”What resurrection there is takes place mostly in small towns like Colton (population 415), a farming community in Eastern Washington where everyone knows everyone and most students do not put locks on their lockers.“We’re more focused on getting along with each other and acting like ourselves, rather than having to glamour up to impress people,” CJ said. “Junior Miss is about how you see yourself as beautiful.”The school has 169 students in kindergarten through 12th grade. Emily, CJ and Ashley Nygreen, 17, had a slight advantage in the competition because they were on the school’s high honor roll, Emily said.Colton is in the Palouse, a fertile, rolling expanse of farmland. But it is not a hick town. Washington State University and the University of Idaho are just down the road. The contestants all plan to attend college, and the $1,500 in scholarship money for the winner would come in handy.Two contestants’ fathers farm thousands of acres with garbanzo beans, lentils, wheat and barley. Among the other parents are mechanical and civil engineers, a chemist, a librarian, a nurse, a stay-at-home mother and a lumber grader.Just before 6:30 on a recent Saturday night, Jane Ann Nagle gave the contestants one last pep talk. Ms. Nagle, 19, won the 2004 contest in nearby Pullman and jump-started the program in Colton. She organized weekly practices and recruited the contestants, including her 17-year-old sister, Pamela.“No matter what happens, girls, keep going, keep smiling — and I want some sass!” Ms. Nagle said.With a few hundred friends and relatives watching from folding chairs in the gym, the curtains parted for the opening number, a mild, hip-swaying “Arabian Nights” dance the girls performed in front of a painted palace and two camels.Next came the group fitness routine. The girls giggled during the kick line and forced smiles during push-ups, situps and twists. Then they rushed to the dressing room, a space ordinarily used for preschool, to put on their talent costumes.“Nerve-racking!” Emily declared, after changing into a long red dress for her piano performance.Nearby, Bridget Wos, 17, said, “I’m kind of regretting that my dad is in the front row.”Alisa Moehrle, 16, performed a flawless exhibition of basketball skills that ended with a reverse dunk into a low hoop.CJ’s many fans cheered her off-tune piano skit inspired by Molly Shannon’s nerdy Catholic schoolgirl character on “Saturday Night Live.” For her big finish, she dropped to one knee, threw her hands up and, as Ms. Shannon does, shouted, “Superstar!”When Emily finished at the piano, she went backstage and took deep breaths to calm herself.The contestants then changed to evening gowns, some left over from the prom, for the final two events. To show poise, they glided across the stage in their heels. For self-expression, each was asked to interpret a quote from a random lot of luminaries, including Winston Churchill, Anne Frank and John Lennon.It was here that Emily showed her chops. Presented with a quote from Churchill about courage, Emily succinctly summed it up: “Don’t lose hope, and keep going.”The judges’ deliberations were excruciatingly slow, forcing the girls to kill time in their preschool dressing room. Relieved that her performance was behind her, Emily twirled about in a gauzy, rose-pink gown. “We’re done, we’re done!” she said.CJ, in a periwinkle dress that matched her eyes, parked herself in a preschooler’s chair and colored with felt-tip pens.Just before the M.C. announced the winner, the girls gathered in a circle and held out their palms to play “Down by the Banks of the Hanky Panky,” a hand-slapping game they learned as children. They slapped one another’s hands to settle their nerves, then filed out to hear the results: The second alternate, with a $125 scholarship, was Ashley Nygreen. The first alternate, with a $250 scholarship, was CJ Becker.Emily gave a small wave as she accepted a rose and the medallion. Then, with the sudden realization that she would have to perform again at the state competition, her mouth formed the words, “Oh my God.”'"
"'07-04-02,'1','BAGHDAD, April 1 — Mortar attacks, suicide car bombs, roadside bombs, ambushes and gun battles killed at least two dozen people on Sunday, including four American soldiers, the authorities said.The American military command said the soldiers were killed southwest of Baghdad just after midnight as they responded to an earlier bombing that had killed two other American soldiers. The insurgents have frequently tried to reap greater death tolls by carrying out attacks against rescue crews rushing to bomb sites.The attacks coincided with a visit to Iraq by a Republican Congressional delegation led by Senator John McCain, who declared at a news conference that the new American security plan was “making progress” and that there was cause for “very cautious optimism.”In sometimes testy comments to reporters in the heavily fortified Green Zone, Mr. McCain said the American public was not receiving “the full picture about what’s happening,” and he described the delegation’s visit to a downtown market where scores of people have died this year in multiple car bombings and other attacks. There, the members of Congress said, they strolled around, haggled with merchants and drank tea.But the outing was far from carefree. The delegation traveled in a convoy of armored military vehicles and was accompanied by a large contingent of heavily armed soldiers. The politicians wore body armor while they shopped.'"
"'07-04-02,'1','Inside the Ferry Building, in the lunchroom where some immigrants had their last meals before becoming New Yorkers, visitors will find an exhibit about the hospital complex, which at times held hundreds of patients with infectious and contagious diseases.Turning those buildings into comfortable meeting spaces for teachers, students and executives is expected to take about seven years and cost more than $250 million, said Judith R. McAlpin, president of Save Ellis Island, a nonprofit group dedicated to preserving the structures.“We’re only at the very beginning,” said Ms. McAlpin, who is leading the fund-raising on behalf of the National Park Service, which oversees Ellis Island and the Statue of Liberty nearby.Crews have removed toxic materials, like asbestos and lead paint, from the hospital buildings, but the floors and stairwells are in shabby condition, said Cynthia R. Garrett, the superintendent of the statue and Ellis Island.In the complex of wards that held people with infectious diseases, much was left as it was a half-century ago. The beds are gone, but the sinks and supply cabinets are intact. In an empty third-floor room in one hospital wing, sunshine beamed through a skylight to a spot where an operating table once stood.The laundry building, the next to be restored and reopened, still holds a rusted washing machine labeled “The Fletcher Whirlwind” and a giant horizontal dryer for bed linens that was known as a mangle.Darcy Hartman, the director of education and public programs for Save Ellis Island, said the group hoped to display the old machines to impress upon visitors what a bustling complex the hospital once was.April 17 will mark the 100th anniversary of the peak of activity on Ellis Island, when it processed 11,747 immigrants in a single day. In 1907, more than 1.1 million passed through the immigration station there. In the 68 years it was in operation, it processed about 12 million immigrants.About 90 percent of them passed a doctor’s once-over that was known as a “six-second inspection” and were on their way within a few hours, Ms. Hartman said. The rest were held for further inspection, treatment and even quarantine.About one of every 100 was refused admission to the country for having a “loathsome and contagious” disease, Ms. Hartman said.The exhibit in the Ferry Building, titled “Future in the Balance: Immigrants, Public Health and Ellis Island’s Hospitals,” includes pictures of the complex in its heyday in the early 20th century and tales from some of the immigrants, doctors and nurses who spent time there before it was abandoned.The Ferry Building replaced an original wooden structure that stood on the same site, next to the dock where a ferry named Ellis Island picked up loads of immigrants bound for Manhattan.The Ferry Building was built in Art Deco style by the federal Public Works Administration for just $133,000 and opened for use in January 1936. It closed in 1954.The restoration took so long in part because of decades of neglect, Ms. Garrett said.“This was a ruin,” she said. “It had been exposed to the elements for 50 years.”Looking up toward the 36-foot-high ceiling in the waiting room, she recalled, “you could see the sky.”Workers peeled the lead coating off four carved eagles perched atop a cupola that crowns the waiting room and replaced it with zinc, said Don Fiorino, who managed the project for the park service.They were surprised that the building’s beacon still worked after they replaced the bulb, he said. An old electric wall fan also was cleaned up and plugged back in above a doorway in the lunchroom.For at least two months, visitors will be able to stand on the gleaming terrazzo floors and gaze out the building’s refinished steel windows at the carcass of the Ellis Island, which sank at its mooring in the 1970s.The park service plans to cut up what is left of it and haul it away this spring.'"
"'07-04-02,'1','In recent months, EMI has discussed proposals to sell unprotected songs through a variety of digital music services that compete with Apple, including online retail units operated by RealNetworks and Yahoo, according to people briefed on the company’s affairs. But those plans appeared to stall after the parties could not agree on financial terms.Mr. Jobs waded into the controversy this year with a letter, posted on Apple’s Web site, that urged the music industry to abandon the use of the digital rights management technologies that limit the ability of consumers to transfer music.Apple has faced intense criticism from governments and consumer groups across Europe over the last year because of the digital protections on music sold by iTunes. France passed a law intended to encourage the easy transfer of music between digital devices.While many independent labels already sell music without copy protection, EMI has placed itself at the forefront of the major music companies in questioning the usefulness of such protection.Last week, Mr. Nicoli told a mobile operators’ meeting in Orlando, Fla., that test sales of unprotected music by a few artists offered some promising results, but did not say whether EMI would expand or abandon the practice.If the announcement on Monday does involve the Beatles, the experiment may be a much-anticipated Yellow Submarine iPod that comes supplied with Beatles tracks, according to Mark Mulligan, a vice president at JupiterResearch who specializes in digital music.“The trademark settlement deal clearly raised the possibility of Apple selling EMI music in a physical format,” Mr. Mulligan said. “This is an original idea and helps Apple with their core business, selling devices.”Such a device had been rumored for introduction on Valentine’s Day, but never appeared, Mr. Mulligan said. He added that speculation that the announcement might involve the sale of music without copy protection is a result of EMI’s drawn-out negotiations with a number of music retailers.“Negotiations for sale of unprotected music through retailers, including iTunes, Napster and others, just faded out,” Mr. Mulligan said. “The idea of a major record label selling unprotected music was unthinkable a year ago, but is now under serious consideration.”The possible sale of unprotected music has been driven in part by the much larger illegal downloading markets, he said. Some European countries have so much piracy that five songs are downloaded illegally for each song sold over the Internet, according to JupiterResearch.Mr. Mulligan insisted on holding in reserve one theory about Apple’s plans: “Knowing Apple, they could be bringing out a major surprise we have not yet considered.”'"
"'07-04-02,'1','In 2006, the number of households with PCs that downloaded at least one song using free peer-to-peer software, like Limewire or BitTorrent, grew a modest 7.2 percent, reaching 14.9 million, according to figures released by the NPD Group, a market-research firm.Meanwhile, the number of PC households that used royalty-paying services like iTunes Store shot up 65.8 percent to 12.6 million, meaning such services could soon become the most widely used method of downloading music.But the average peer-to-peer household still downloads far more songs. Peer-to-peer networks yielded five billion downloads in 2006, whereas 509 million songs were downloaded from iTunes-style services.The explanation may be, quite simply, that free downloads are easier to gorge on than downloads you have to pay for. But there are other reasons peer-to-peer users download so many songs, said Russ Crupnick, an analyst with NPD. Among them is the declining price and increasing size of hard drives. “When I talk to people who are involved in a lot of peer to peer, they’re running around with external hard drives,” he said.NPD gathered its data from tracking software installed on 12,000 home PCs. The data was adjusted to reflect the Internet-using population, and then extrapolated to the roughly 70 million Internet-using households in the United States. ALEX MINDLIN'"
"'07-04-02,'1','Maytag is going in another direction to find someone to portray its familiar advertising character.At a news conference today in Midtown Manhattan, Clay Jackson is to be introduced as the new Maytag repairman. Unlike his three predecessors, the tall (6 feet, 6 inches) Mr. Jackson is not an experienced actor.Indeed, according to his biography, Mr. Jackson, who is 33, last worked as an actor in 2000 and has for the last several years been a real estate agent in Richmond, Va., at a company owned by his family.The three actors who previously portrayed Ol’ Lonely, as the character is called in national campaigns, are Jesse White, 1967-88; Gordon Jump (better known as Mr. Carlson on WKRP in Cincinnati), 1989-2003; and Hardy Rawls, 2003-7.When Mr. Rawls’s contract expired, executives at Maytag and its three marketing agencies decided to expand the auditions for a replacement beyond professional actors. There were live auditions in Chicago, Los Angeles and New York and — in the vein of the recent NBC reality series, “Grease: You’re the One That I Want” — they were open to pros and amateurs alike. The process was even chronicled on a Web site (nextmaytagrepairman.com).The character “is more than an advertising icon; he’s part of popular culture,” said Jeffrey Davidoff, vice president for Maytag brand marketing at the parent Whirlpool Corporation in Benton Harbor, Mich. “If that’s the case, why not let the public take part in the search?”The field of more than 1,500 contenders was culled through two callbacks to 80 people, Mr. Davidoff said, then winnowed in March to four actors and two neophytes. Mr. Jackson, who tried out at the New York audition on a whim, was selected because he can not only “play the character,” Mr. Davidoff said, but personally embodied the Maytag attributes of “reliability and dependability.”'"
"'07-04-02,'1','Piracy may seem like the biggest threat to Hollywood, but Ms. Antonellis suggested instead that changing consumer behavior will have a greater impact on the entertainment business.Movie studios, like their peers in music and television, are in the midst of a significant and frightening shift as almost every form of media is becoming ubiquitous on the Internet. And through sites like YouTube, viewers have grown accustomed to seeing whatever they want to see, free.“People thinking it is O.K. to take this stuff for free on a worldwide basis has a bigger impact than anything,” said Ms. Antonellis.Many entertainment companies are growing impatient watching companies like YouTube distribute clips of movies and television shows free. At the same time they are concerned that YouTube earns advertising revenue from Web sites that offer pirated movies for sale on the site. Even while negotiating with YouTube, NBC Universal and Fox announced their own joint video service, and Viacom filed a $1 billion lawsuit against Google, which owns YouTube.Missteps made today could have grave consequences for the future, particularly when it comes to consumers’ willingness to pay for movies and television shows online, she believes. To illustrate the point, she tells of her niece’s fish, named Mortimer, who one day leaped from his bowl, flopped on the table and gasped for air.“Mortimer took the leap to freedom,” she said. “He said, ‘I’m free, but I’m dead,’ ” said Ms. Antonellis.Warner and other entertainment companies are moving cautiously ahead, but their interests are divided. All want to share their content online with consumers but are, at the same time, imposing constraints that risk alienating a younger, Web-oriented audience.On the piracy front, Ms. Antonellis said Warner has created four small teams that range from a two-person operation to nearly a dozen people in a larger group.The teams are based in Burbank, London and Hong Kong, and most have dual roles in piracy and other Warner operations, like the legal department. Ms. Antonellis said she wanted the teams to understand both areas because “you can’t hand down policies in a vacuum. It doesn’t work.”Warner’s emphasis shifts depending on where piracy is most rampant. As well as cracking down in countries like China, where pirated DVDs are sold on street corners for as little as $1 on the same day a movie is released, the company also works with the United States Trade Representative’s office to monitor pirated movies.Like many studios, Warner can trace the origin of movies that have been copied using camcorders, but they are particularly aggressive on this front. Russia is particularly difficult to police because of the vast amount of money available to finance the making and sale of black market DVDs.Recently the Hollywood studios took their case to Washington, with celebrities like Will Smith and Clint Eastwood in tow, to educate legislators on the damaging impact of piracy on their business. Ms. Antonellis was there; she is the piracy liaison for Warner to the Motion Picture Association of America, the industry’s lobbying group.For her part, Ms. Antonellis and her team review all the deals Warner seeks, particularly those online and for distributing content over mobile phones. She has considerable sway; Warner deal makers rely on her expertise to tell them how a deal should be structured.When it comes to YouTube, Time Warner is in a delicate position. In 2005, Google spent $1 billion for a stake in America Online, a division of Time Warner, and expanded its strategic alliance. Google bought YouTube last year.Not surprisingly, Ms. Antonellis is conservative in her comments about the media companies’ negotiations with YouTube.“Clearly the lawsuit has sent out a message,” she said of Viacom’s suit. “We are hopeful that social networks such as YouTube will put in place proper systems which will reflect our intellectual property and will facilitate legal offerings.”Ms. Antonellis is the rare Hollywood executive who never planned on a studio career. The 44-year-old former college tennis pro hoped to become a journalist until, as she put it, she learned writing was not her gift. She had an aptitude for math, though. After her freshman year at Temple University, two hours from her hometown, Newark, Ms. Antonellis decided to sign up for the electrical engineering program instead.She did not abandon her interest in news, though. She graduated in 1984 and headed to New York City where she got an engineering internship at CBS working with Chris Cookson, the chief technology officer of Warner Brothers Entertainment who was then an executive in the technical operations department of CBS. In 1988 she moved to Washington where Mr. Cookson appointed her director of Washington operations for the CBS news bureau.“We’re the folks behind the curtain who make the broadcast look as seamless as possible,” said Ms. Antonellis.If anything prepared Ms. Antonellis for a career in Hollywood, perhaps it was the two months she spent in Kuwait during the gulf war as director of technical operations for CBS News. Then she worked for well-known and demanding bosses, among them the news anchor Dan Rather. She was a skillful negotiator, bartering with locals for a generator to light the set. And she was quick to adapt, dressing like a military officer because women were not allowed to drive.In Washington she was exposed to other divisions: sports, news magazines, even soap operas, which were sometimes filmed in the studio.“One day the elevator door opened and a pot-bellied pig walked out,” said Ms. Antonellis, who has won two Emmy Awards for her technical prowess. “I thought, ‘O.K., we are doing a story on a pot-bellied pig. Do we bring him to the green room? Do we have to worry about him eating all the crudités?’ ”She left Washington in 1991 and moved back to New York and worked in operations and engineering for CBS Sports, covering three Olympics, including the 1998 Winter Olympics in Nagano, Japan. That same year Mr. Cookson recruited her to Warner to help with the studio’s transition to a digital world.“We share here a belief and understanding in new technology and that consumers want to experience our movies and television shows differently,” Mr. Cookson said. “Darcy really understands the whole equation.”Ms. Antonellis believes that the next three months will be most critical for Hollywood as the need to offer legal movies and television shows to consumers intensifies. When asked about criticism that studios aren’t moving quickly to offer content online, she pointed to a deal Warner made last year with BitTorrent, a movie-swapping site that approached the Motion Picture Association of America about selling movies legally.“We were criticized for not being aggressive enough,” she said. “At the same time, we can’t be faulted for being radical in our approach.”Indeed, Warner spends millions in research to understand what consumers want. And the results can be surprising. In Britain, Warner recently found that consumers there were more interested in watching feature films, as opposed to television programs, on portable devices because their commutes were twice as long.“If we don’t encompass the last piece in our thinking — how consumers want to use content — then we are going to miss it,” said Miss Antonellis. “Just think how consumer behavior has evolved in the last two years.”Last year Steven P. Jobs, the chief executive of Apple and a director of the Walt Disney Company, announced a deal with Disney to offer movies on Apple’s video iPod. Despite that, many of Disney’s competitors remained holdouts. At the heart of the debate are the standards governing digital rights management, commonly called D.R.M. Studios want stricter rules on copying, while Mr. Jobs supports a more liberal approach, particularly with music.“There may be opportunities down the road but we have to come to some agreement about what the offerings will be,” said Ms. Antonellis of Warner’s and Apple’s discussion. “The term D.R.M. is steeped and mired in its legacy definition. Today, call it something else. I don’t care what you call it. Get rid of it. But we need to make this work so we can get a deal.”Ms. Antonellis may have to rely not only her technical expertise but the valuable communication skills she learned at CBS.“Part of my responsibility is to take technology-based ideas and take it out of the techie space,” she said. “If executives look at me like I have three heads, then I’ve failed as an executive.”'"

"'07-04-03,'1','Mr. Yushchenko called new elections for May 27, less than eight weeks away.Mr. Yanukovich’s supporters in Parliament responded by calling an emergency session and passing a resolution declaring Mr. Yushchenko’s decree to disband Parliament unconstitutional.The deputies voted against allocating money for the new elections, suspended the central election committee and forwarded a plea to the Constitutional Court to rule on Mr. Yushchenko’s order, maneuvers that challenged Mr. Yushchenko’s authority.Then, in the early hours of today, Mr. Yanukovich met with his cabinet and passed a resolution that government agencies must obey the Parliament’s rejection of the presidential order, the Interfax news agency reported.Later today, however, Mr. Yushchenko threatened to override the cabinet’s resolution with an opposite set of orders from his own office.As the political dispute unfolded, Ukraine’s defense minister, Anatoly Hrytsenko, a hawkish pro-Western politician in the Ukrainian government, said the army would obey only the president.“The Armed Forces of Ukraine which are subordinate to the Commander in Chief will carry out only his orders,” Defense Ministry spokesman Anatoly Sadilov said in a telephone interview.On Monday, in a meeting with party leaders, Mr. Yushchenko accused the Party of Regions led by Mr. Yanukovich of consolidating power. The coalition led by Mr. Yanukovich had been recruiting Mr. Yushchenko’s allies and boasting that it would achieve a veto-proof two-thirds majority of 300 votes, further undermining Mr. Yushchenko’s authority.Just last month, some of Mr. Yushchenko’s supporters in Parliament defected to Mr. Yanukovich’s coalition, most prominently Anatoly K. Kinakh, the president’s former national security adviser.Mr. Yushchenko, in his address on Monday, said his dissolving of Parliament was motivated by “an acute necessity to preserve the nation, its sovereignty and territorial integrity.”All but written off after Mr. Yushchenko defeated him, Mr. Yanukovich staged an improbable comeback in parliamentary elections in March 2006, and formed enough of a coalition to become prime minister in August, leading to the power-sharing deal that ended Monday.Mr. Yushchenko’s press service said Monday that the decree dissolving the Rada, as the Parliament is known, would take effect on Tuesday morning, when it was to be published in a government newspaper.“Early elections to the Rada will take place in full compliance with the Constitution of Ukraine and democratic, national and international standards,” he said in his speech.Mr. Yushchenko, whose face was disfigured from dioxin poisoning before the 2004 election in a mystery that has never been solved, has generally preferred compromise in his two years in power, to the point that critics and supporters alike have labeled him indecisive.He has declared his role to be ensuring democracy in Ukraine, even if that means his political opponents win at the polls, as happened in the March 2006 elections that led to the impasse on Monday. Polls, meanwhile, suggest new elections may not resolve the divisions; they give Mr. Yanukovich’s party a slight lead over a bloc led by former prime minister, Yulia V. Tymoshenko, who supported the dissolution of parliament, followed by the Our Ukraine Party of Mr. Yushchenko in third place.'"
"'07-04-03,'1','The man who had been the chosen successor to lead the Yankees spent opening day at Yankee Stadium avoiding his wife, ducking the suite of the principal owner, George Steinbrenner, and cautiously pronouncing that everything was fine.Last Wednesday, Steinbrenner’s daughter Jennifer filed for divorce from Steve Swindal, the team’s chairman of the board and the man Steinbrenner had chosen to succeed him.Swindal did not enter the owner’s suite yesterday, where Steinbrenner, three of his children — Jennifer, Jessica, and Hal — and an assortment of grandchildren watched the Yankees’ 9-5 victory on opening day.Since the divorce was announced, it has become clear that Steinbrenner no longer plans for Swindal to succeed him.Yet Swindal appeared confident outside the stadium after the game as he discussed his future.“It’s business as usual,” Swindal said. “I am here.”Swindal said that he continued to talk to Steinbrenner from “time to time.”Swindal’s financial interests with the Yankees are complex. He is listed as the chairman of Yankee Global Enterprises, the umbrella company for the club and the YES Network.'"
"'07-04-03,'1','Jeter said Williams sounded fine. “His voice didn’t crack or anything,” Jeter said.Hiram Williams described Bernie, his older brother, as a big brother to Jeter and Posada. Although the friendships may remain, Hiram said it was a much different feeling for his brother these days. Torre sensed that, too.Bernie Williams declined an invitation to compete for a roster spot in spring training because the Yankees did not offer a guaranteed contract. So, while Williams, who still lives in Armonk, N.Y., works out three or four times a week and hopes his fleeting chances of rejoining the Yankees somehow become more realistic, the team has moved on.“He has this dream that something might happen down the road,” Hiram said in a telephone interview. “Maybe they will need him in the middle of the season. He still has the dream. He definitely wants to play baseball.”When Torre called Bernie Williams in mid-February and nudged him to come to spring training, he was telling Williams that he could not make the Yankees from Armonk. Torre broached the possibility of playing first baseman Doug Mientkiewicz full time, which could have freed up a spot for Williams by eliminating the need for a platoon partner. It seemed unlikely Torre would have pushed for Williams to journey to Tampa, Fla., and then waive him.After Hiram Williams was reminded of Torre’s comments and the situations that could have led to Bernie Williams’s being with the Yankees yesterday, he said he understood why it seemed sensible for Bernie to accept the invitation. Still, Hiram explained why Bernie, who has 2,336 hits, 4 World Series rings and a batting title, refused.“He’s not a journeyman,” Hiram said. “He’s seen the same thing offered to minor leaguers. He’s been with the Yankees for 16 years. Last year, he didn’t do badly. He probably felt that he had earned the right to have a guaranteed spot.”Williams, 38, batted .281 with 12 homers and 61 runs batted in last year and provided a safety net when Hideki Matsui and Gary Sheffield had wrist injuries. Surely, Williams figured, the Yankees would want him back. But General Manager Brian Cashman considered 2006 to be Williams’s swan song and does not see him as an option for 2007.Even if outfielders Johnny Damon, Bobby Abreu or Matsui incur a serious injury, club officials have indicated that their first choice would be to summon Kevin Thompson or Kevin Reese from Class AAA Scranton/Wilkes-Barre.When Roger Clemens ponders a midseason return, he can set his timetable because he is a dominant starter. When Williams, who would be a reserve outfielder with the Yankees, considers the same, he does have not the same liberties.Before the season was an inning old, the fans in the right-field bleachers remembered Williams by chanting, “We want Bernie,” several times. Mariano Rivera did not hear the chant but loved hearing about it.“The job Bernie did for this organization, this city, was tremendous,” Rivera said. “Those fans out there, they know.”Hiram Williams, 37, is a paralegal in San Juan and is a cellist who appeared on his brother’s first album. If Bernie, a guitarist, does another album, Hiram will probably perform on it as well. But for now, Hiram said, Bernie remains focused on baseball over music. Even if it is a long shot, Bernie still envisions himself as a Yankee.“That would be a nice way for him to end the season,” Hiram said. “Maybe they could do that and it could be a kind of farewell.”'"
"'07-04-03,'1','WASHINGTON, April 2 — The Justice Department, in an indictment disclosed Monday, charged that agencies of the Indian government participated in a conspiracy to sidestep United States export regulations and obtain secret weapons technology from American companies over several years.The indictment charges that a private electronics firm, Cirrus Inc., operating in Singapore, South Carolina and Bangalore, India, was working as an agent of the Indian government to obtain sensitive missile and weapons technology for its military programs.It lists four company officials, including the founder, Parthasarathy Sudarshan, and a number of unidentified co-conspirators who were not charged, including one mentioned only as an Indian government official who worked in Washington. The indictment indicates that the defendants were buying equipment for three Indian government agencies.The charges, coming just months after Congress approved President Bush’s plan to ship American nuclear reactors and fuel to India, could prove to be a diplomatic embarrassment for the administration, which has made cementing closer ties with India a top foreign policy priority.The indictment suggests that India broke a pledge to the Bush administration more than two years ago not to flout American export laws and secretly seek weapons technology from the United States.'"
"'07-04-03,'1','MIAMI, April 2 — Hinting that a remarkable turnaround in state policy was near, Gov. Charlie Crist said Monday that he hoped to persuade members of the Florida cabinet this week to end the practice of stripping convicted felons of their right to vote.Florida is the most populous of three states whose constitutions require withdrawal of voting rights from all convicted felons, and it has the nation’s largest number of disenfranchised former offenders. The other two states are Kentucky and Virginia.Felons in Florida who have served their prison and probation time can apply to have their voting rights reinstated, but the process can be time consuming and complex. Only a few hundred have their rights restored each year in Florida, where the American Civil Liberties Union says 950,000 remain disenfranchised.Mr. Crist, a Republican, said that to win the support of some cabinet members, he might require former felons to pay whatever restitution they owe to victims before regaining their rights. Some civil rights groups, including the A.C.L.U., oppose such a compromise, but Mr. Crist said he had little choice.“I want to do the doable,” he told reporters in Tallahassee. “I’m pushing as hard as I can to get as much as I can, but there’s a point beyond which I cannot go.”'"
"'07-04-03,'1','Pennsylvania’s secretary of environmental protection, Kathleen McGinty, added, “We hope it means any further opposition and challenge to the legal standards will go away and we can get about the job of cleaning up the auto fleet and making a dent in greenhouse-gas pollution.”The arguments rejected by the court have been invoked in other legal challenges, including a case pending in California in which auto industry trade groups argue against that state’s law controlling carbon-dioxide emissions from cars, and one in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, where electric utilities are fighting the E.P.A.’s authority to regulate their emissions of heat-trapping gases like carbon dioxide.Both cases had been stayed awaiting yesterday’s ruling.Some companies may now find new affection for proposals in Congress for a cap-and-trade system to aid emissions control. Under this type of system, companies that had reduced emissions beyond a set limit could sell credits earned by their excess reductions to companies that failed to meet emissions limits.“This flips the debate from an environment in which Congress must act if there is to be federal action,” said Tim Profeta, the director of the Nicholas Institute for the Environment at Duke University, “to one in which the E.P.A. can act as soon as an administration friendly to the concept is in power.”“If there is a President Clinton or President McCain,” Mr. Profeta added, “he or she doesn’t have to go to Congress to get action.”The reaction from Capitol Hill underscored this point.“While I still believe Congress did not intend for the Clean Air Act to regulate greenhouse gases, the Supreme Court has made its decision and the matter is now settled,” Mr. Dingell said in a prepared statement. “Today’s ruling provides another compelling reason why Congress must enact, and the president must sign, comprehensive climate change legislation.”Senator Barbara Boxer, Democrat of California and a sponsor of the most stringent of the global-warming proposals currently before Congress, said in a statement: “This decision puts the wind at our back. It takes away the excuse the administration has been using for not taking action to deal with global-warming pollution.”Another prod for federal action is the likelihood that California will be able to use the new ruling to parry legal challenges to its new law calling for a cut of nearly 30 percent in carbon dioxide emissions on passenger vehicles sold in the state starting in 2016. A dozen other states, including Connecticut, New Jersey and New York, have enacted laws adopting the California standard. These states are home to more than a third of the vehicles sold in the United States.But before those standards can take effect, the environmental agency must grant the states a waiver.“I am very encouraged by the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision today that greenhouse gases are pollutants and should be regulated by the federal government,” said Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger of California, a Republican. “We expect the U.S. E.P.A. to move quickly now in granting our request for a waiver.”The prospect of separate state and federal emissions standards is one of Detroit’s worst nightmares.Walter McManus, director of automotive analysis for the Transportation Research Institute at the University of Michigan, argued that the environmental agency was best suited to regulate automotive emissions and fuel economy.“They are the ones who really have the expertise about fuel economy and greenhouse gases,” Mr. McManus said.'"
"'07-04-03,'1','How much effort should we expend to ward off the possibility that an asteroid might some day collide with Earth? Space experts attending a recent conference in Washington lamented the failure of the federal government — indeed, of the entire world — to take the threat seriously enough. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration, at virtually the same moment, advised Congress on steps that could be taken to find and divert threatening asteroids only to conclude that it couldn’t afford them.That seems shortsighted. The risk is remote, but the consequences are potentially catastrophic. It would seem wise, at a minimum, to look harder for any death-dealing rocks that might menace us.The encouraging news is that the most horrendous hazards — asteroids like the one that wiped out the dinosaurs or even smaller objects whose impact could disrupt the global environment — have mostly been identified under a $4 million-a-year survey program. The space agency estimates that there are some 1,100 near-Earth objects whose diameters exceed six-tenths of a mile, big enough to destroy a medium-sized state and kick up enough dust to affect global climate and crop production. The survey has already identified more than 700 of them. None are on a path to collide with Earth.More troublesome is the threat of smaller asteroids, greater than 460 feet in diameter (about one-seventh the threshold of the really scary big ones), that could devastate a region but not the whole globe. NASA estimates that some 20,000 of these might be potentially hazardous; it has identified only a fraction of them. Two years ago Congress asked NASA to propose new search programs and to analyze ways to divert any asteroids on a collision course with Earth. The agency did that in a March report to Congress, but it balked at the notion of spending up to $1 billion or more to build search instruments or spacecraft.That is understandable. NASA is burdened with the need to finish the space station, build a successor to the shuttles, return to the moon and conduct wide-ranging research. It already has more jobs to perform than money to perform them. But finding asteroids that might threaten the planet, and studying their characteristics in the process, is probably more important than at least some of the other robotic missions mounted by NASA. Congress should either add funds to the agency’s budget, or the agency should divert funds from other programs to accelerate the asteroid hunt.Developing ways to deflect asteroids is more problematic. NASA suggests that the best solution would be to explode a nuclear bomb next to an asteroid to deflect it off course, but international aversion to nuclear weapons in space would make that approach difficult without a global consensus. Other experts favor a high-speed ballistic impact or using the gravitational attraction of a hovering spacecraft to nudge the asteroid off course. Before plunging ahead with an asteroid-deflector, let’s wait to see whether a real threat even exists.'"
"'07-04-03,'1','But the market that the congressmen said they saw is fundamentally different from the market Iraqis know.Merchants and customers say that a campaign by insurgents to attack Baghdad’s markets has put many shop owners out of business and forced radical changes in the way people shop. Shorja, the city’s oldest and largest market, set in a sprawling labyrinth of narrow streets and alleyways, has been bombed at least a half-dozen times since last summer.At least 61 people were killed and many more wounded in a three-pronged attack there on Feb. 12 involving two vehicle bombs and a roadside bomb.American and Iraqi security forces have tried to protect Shorja and other markets against car bombs by restricting vehicular traffic in some shopping areas and erecting blast walls around the markets’ perimeters. But those measures, while making the markets safer, have not made them safe.In the latest large-scale attack on a Baghdad market, at least 60 people, most of them women and children, were killed last Thursday when a man wrapped in an explosives belt walked around such barriers into a crowded street market in the Shaab neighborhood and blew himself up.In recent weeks, snipers hidden in Shorja’s bazaar have killed several people, merchants and the police say, and gunfights have erupted between militants and the Iraqi security forces in the area.During their visit on Sunday, the Americans were buttonholed by merchants and customers who wanted to talk about how unsafe they felt and the urgent need for more security in the markets and throughout the city, witnesses said.“They asked about our conditions, and we told them the situation was bad,” said Aboud Sharif Kadhoury, 63, who peddles prayer rugs at a sidewalk stand. He said he sold a small prayer rug worth less than $1 to a member of the Congressional delegation. (The official paid $20 and told Mr. Kadhoury to keep the change, the vendor said.)Mr. Kadhoury said he lost more than $2,000 worth of merchandise in the triple bombing in February. “I was hit in the head and back with shrapnel,” he recalled.Ali Youssef, 39, who sells glassware from a sidewalk stand down the block from Mr. Kadhoury, recalled: “Everybody complained to them. We told them we were harmed.”He and other merchants used to keep their shops open until dusk, but with the dropoff in customers as a result of the attacks, and a nightly curfew, most shop owners close their businesses in the early afternoon.“This area here is very dangerous,” continued Mr. Youssef, who lost his shop in the February attack. “They cannot secure it.”But those conversations were not reflected in the congressmen’s comments at the news conference on Sunday.Instead, the politicians spoke of strolling through the marketplace, haggling with merchants and drinking tea. “The most deeply moving thing for me was to mix and mingle unfettered,” Mr. Pence said.Mr. McCain was asked about a comment he made on a radio program in which he said that he could walk freely through certain areas of Baghdad.“I just came from one,” he replied sharply. “Things are better and there are encouraging signs.”He added, “Never have I been able to go out into the city as I was today.”Told about Mr. McCain’s assessment of the market, Abu Samer, a kitchenware and clothing wholesaler, scoffed: “He is just using this visit for publicity. He is just using it for himself. They’ll just take a photo of him at our market and they will just show it in the United States. He will win in America and we will have nothing.”A Senate spokeswoman for Mr. McCain said he left Iraq on Monday and was unavailable for comment because he was traveling.Several merchants said Monday that the Americans’ visit might have only made the market a more inviting target for insurgents.“Every time the government announces anything — that the electricity is good or the water supply is good — the insurgents come to attack it immediately,” said Abu Samer, 49, who would give only his nickname out of concern for his safety.But even though he was fearful of a revenge attack, he said, he could not afford to stay away from the market. This was his livelihood. “We can never anticipate when they will attack,” he said, his voice heavy with gloomy resignation. “This is not a new worry.”'"
"'07-04-03,'1','The auditor of Fremont General, a troubled financial company that is trying to sell its subprime mortgage business, has resigned with a complaint that the company had failed to provide information when promised.The resignation was disclosed by Fremont General in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission after the stock market closed yesterday.In it, Grant Thornton, the auditing firm, said that it disagreed with statements that the company had made in announcing the departure.The departure of the auditing firm, which was hired in August after Fremont fired its former auditor, Ernst & Young, raised questions about when, if ever, the company would be able to file its annual report for 2006, which is already overdue.In the S.E.C. filing, Fremont said its audit committee was looking for a new auditor, but added, “There can be no assurance that the company will be able to retain a new independent registered public accounting firm.”'"
"'07-04-03,'1','“I don’t think that we’re at the point of being ready mentally to play the way that is necessary going into the playoffs,” Lamoriello said at Continental Arena. “I’m not saying that’s going to change, but there needs to be better focus going forward.”Lamoriello did not divulge exactly why Julien was fired Monday morning, but he said it was not a snap decision. Lamoriello said that the firing was not personal and that Julien told him he understood. Julien could not be reached for comment.Lamoriello said he told the players of the coaching change at a noon meeting Monday. They were not involved in the decision, he said. John MacLean, an assistant coach who also played for the team, was not considered as an interim replacement. “This situation, with a week left, is not the right time,” Lamoriello said.The move had the blessing of Jeffrey Vanderbeek, the former Wall Street executive who became the principal owner of the Devils nearly three years ago and is striving to open a 17,625-seat arena in downtown Newark by next season.“Lou and I don’t go a day without talking,” Vanderbeek said in a telephone interview. “Sometimes, we talk 5, 10 times a day. We’re completely together on this. So not only was I a part of it, I’m 100 percent behind it.”Lamoriello has changed coaches seven times in the last seven years. Two coaches resigned — Robinson and Pat Burns, who left after the 2003-4 season because he had cancer. Robinson coached the Devils twice in that span. He was fired the first time.“There are a lot of things that went into this,” Vanderbeek said, “and those things will stay between Lou and myself. But we’re always going to do what’s in the best interests of the team to win the Stanley Cup. There are a lot of teams with more than 100 points this year who are capable of winning it. This team demands excellence; this organization demands excellence.”Lamoriello’s announcement apparently caught the team by surprise. The Devils had beaten Boston on Sunday for their fourth victory in five games, and the consensus among the players was that they were rounding into playoff form.“It took us a while, but we got it going,” Patrik Elias, the Devils’ captain, said Monday.Although the N.H.L. put in several rule changes to stimulate more scoring, the Devils cling to an effective, defense-first style of play. Lamoriello hinted that he was not pleased that the Devils had scored only 209 goals, by far the fewest of the top eight Eastern Conference teams.Elias said of Lamoriello’s regime: “There’s not going to be that much difference from the style we’ve used. But I noticed when he came in last year, there was a lot better unity with the guys. We were backing each other up.”The Devils play host to Ottawa on Tuesday in an important game for playoff seeding before ending the season with games Friday at Philadelphia and Sunday at home against the Islanders. Lamoriello will coach a team he swore he would never coach again.“Never say never,” he said Monday. “The circumstances dictate certain situations.”'"
"'07-04-03,'1','A federal judge in Houston dismissed charges yesterday against a former energy trader at Enron who admitted to participating in the fraud that destroyed the company.Christopher Calger, a former executive in Enron’s energy trading division, pleaded guilty in 2005 to inflating earnings through a deal with a partnership run by the former chief financial officer, Andrew S. Fastow.Mr. Calger’s case was based on the same legal theory that an appeals court rejected in overturning Enron-related convictions of four Merrill Lynch bankers in August, his lawyer said.The Merrill bankers were accused of depriving Enron of their “honest services.” The appeals court said that reasoning was faulty because they acted in Enron’s best interest and did not personally profit.Six of eight convictions brought on the “honest services” theory have been reversed.'"
"'07-04-03,'1','“It’s definitely the end of an era,” said Guy Cecala, publisher of Inside Mortgage Finance, an industry newsletter.Yesterday, New Century, which survived a similar credit squeeze nearly a decade ago that took out much of its competition, said it would dismiss 3,200 employees, or slightly more than half of its staff.It also outlined a plan to liquidate itself over the next 45 days in auctions for its three principal assets: the platform it used to make home loans, the operation that serviced mortgages and the interest it held in pools of loans sold to investors.“As deep into subprime as New Century was, there was just no way out,” said Matthew Howlett, an analyst with Fox-Pitt Kelton.One of the two companies providing New Century with as much as $150 million in financing during the bankruptcy proceeding, Greenwich Capital Financial Products, has agreed to acquire certain loans and residual interests for $50 million. That offer could be bid up in an auction. The other company providing financing to New Century is the CIT Group/Business Credit Inc.A sale of New Century’s servicing assets and platform to Carrington Capital Management for $139 million is planned; those operations collect loan payments, handle customer service, contact delinquent borrowers and oversee foreclosures. That sale is also subject to an auction.Carrington’s involvement is expected to be closely scrutinized by New Century’s creditors, because the two companies have a long and close relationship. In 2004, New Century helped finance the creation of Carrington, which bought subprime mortgages from New Century and Fremont General and packaged them into bonds that were sold to investors.New Century once owned a majority stake in Carrington, which is based in Greenwich, Conn., though its interest had dwindled to 7 percent as of the end of 2005.Officials at Carrington did not return a phone call yesterday.That leaves New Century’s mortgage origination business, which originated $60 billion in mortgages last year. The company was second only to HSBC Finance, the American mortgage division of the large London-based bank, in issuing subprime mortgages in 2006.Still, New Century’s mortgage origination operation may attract few bidders, according to analysts because the business has not been accepting loans for the last three weeks and it is one of many similar businesses up for sale now.Last month, Citadel Investment, a hedge fund, agreed to buy the mortgage origination business of ResMae for $22 million in a bankruptcy auction. H&R Block, the accounting and tax preparation firm, recently missed a self-imposed end-of-March deadline to sell its subprime mortgage business, Option One.And yesterday, Barclays Capital, the London-based bank, said that it had closed its purchase of EquiFirst, a subprime mortgage lender, for $76 million, which is a third of the $225 million it agreed to pay in January.“Frankly, I’m not sure the origination platform is worth anything right now,” said Christopher C. Brendler, an analyst with Stifel Nicolaus, “because of the name, and the fact that so much of the sales force, which dealt with the independent brokers, have already started to leave.”Also, state regulators in California, New York and several other states have restricted New Century from making new loans because it was unable to close on thousands of mortgages when it ran into its liquidity squeeze.In an indication that the company could get some relief from regulators, New Century said yesterday that it had disposed of all 27,000 loans it had in its pipeline when it stopped taking applications on March 12.Given the precarious nature of the subprime mortgage business, it is unclear how much creditors will recover in the bankruptcy proceeding. The company’s filing yesterday did not provide details on how much money it owes other than to say it was more than $100 million.Earlier, New Century said it owed $17.4 billion on credit lines from investment banks; most of those debts were secured by loans that New Century made with those funds. Many of those banks, which declared New Century in default in early March, began seizing the loans or auctioning them off in the last two weeks.The results of those auctions, which have not been disclosed, would provide an important benchmark of what New Century’s assets and loan portfolios are worth, said Zach Gast, an analyst at the Center for Financial Research and Analysis. “The bids for the loans put up for auction will provide a pretty good estimate of how much debtholders will be hurt,” Mr. Gast said.New Century is being advised by Lazard, the investment bank, and AlixPartners, a consulting firm. Its bankruptcy case is being handled by the law firm of O’Melveny & Myers.“This was a very hard step for me personally and clearly not the outcome I would have preferred,” Brad A. Morrice, New Century’s president and chief executive and one of its three co-founders, said in a statement. “However, given the sudden and significant challenges facing our industry and New Century specifically, bankruptcy is the best means available to allow the company’s assets and operations to be sold through an orderly process.”The bankruptcy proceeding, however, may not be the last word for some executives and board members at New Century. The company and its officials are the subject of two federal investigations and numerous class-action lawsuits.'"
"'07-04-03,'1','DENVER, April 2 (Bloomberg News) — Joseph P. Nacchio, the former chief executive of Qwest Communications who is on trial on charges of insider trading, called for a repurchase of $1 billion in company stock in 2001, a former Qwest president testified on Monday.Mr. Nacchio, 57, is accused of selling $101 million in Qwest shares from January 2001 to May 2001, before the stock price plunged, based on inside information that the company would miss its revenue targets.The testimony on Monday could bolster the government’s assertion that Mr. Nacchio sought to prop up the price of Qwest shares so he could profit from selling his stock.Afshin Mohebbi, a former Qwest president who is cooperating with prosecutors under an immunity agreement, told a federal jury in Denver that Mr. Nacchio called an urgent meeting of senior executives on Jan. 3, 2001, to discuss news that BellSouth planned to sell its 9.9 percent stake in Qwest.“Mr. Nacchio was not pleased,” Mr. Mohebbi said. “He was not pleased at all.”Qwest borrowed $1 billion to buy back more than 22 million shares directly from BellSouth to prevent the anticipated price drop from a sell-off, Mr. Mohebbi said. BellSouth was acquired by AT&T in December for $86 billion.'"
"'07-04-03,'1','Xerox said yesterday that it would buy Global Imaging Systems, a provider of office technology products, for $1.5 billion as it sought to expand its reach in the small and midsize business markets.The acquisition will be Xerox’s third and largest in the last 12 months as it tries to bolster growth in equipment revenue, a sore point in its fiscal third-quarter results.“Our biggest barrier to growth was distribution,” the Xerox chairman and chief executive, Anne M. Mulcahy, said in a conference call with analysts.Global Imaging sells printers and copiers to small and midsize businesses, and it will start selling Xerox document-management products after the acquisition.Xerox, the world’s largest provider of office printers, copiers and related services, said it would pay $29 for each share of Global Imaging, a premium of almost 50 percent to its Friday closing price of $19.50. Shares of Global Imaging rose $9.14, to $28.64. Shares of Xerox rose 19 cents, to $17.08.The purchase will expand Xerox’s distribution by 50 percent in the estimated $16 billion market to small to midsize businesses. The deal is expected to close in May.'"
"'07-04-03,'1','On Tuesday morning, the Corps will begin an intensive sweep of the beach to determine how many other potentially explosive devices are lying in the newly replenished sand that was scraped from the ocean floor three miles offshore. The investigative phase is expected to take two weeks, while the time needed to remove what is found will depend on what the sweep uncovers.“After the characterization comes the digging, and that’s the part that becomes more time-consuming,” Mr. Watson said.Last Friday the Corps tested its sweeping system — a flatbed trailer equipped with four powerful ground-penetrating metal detectors called magnetometers that will crawl along the entire stretch of beach, marking and recording the sites where metal objects — from old ordnance to wristwatches — are detected.That was about the time that the state’s two United States senators, Robert Menendez and Frank R. Lautenberg, sent a letter to the Corps urging that the beach be cleaned up by Memorial Day.“We believe the Corps can and must take whatever steps necessary to ensure that the beach at Surf City is clear and safe before the start of the summer season on May 25, 2007,” the letter read. “Any economic disruption during this critical time of year could have disastrous consequences.”Indeed, the prospect of deflecting vacationers to places up and down the island from Barnegat Light to Beach Haven has many residents and business owners worried.“If people want to come down to the beach, and they can’t get onto the beach, there’s no doubt it could hurt business,” said the general manager of the Surf City Hotel, Tom Gentry, whose 26-room hotel, with its 150-seat restaurant, is a leading destination.Ann Tambini, who came here last Friday to open her beach house, was surprised to find the entrance to the beach at the end of her street peppered with “danger” signs and closed off with plastic orange fencing. When she asked at the borough hall what was going on, she was told the beaches would be closed for at least the next two weeks.“It’s really disappointing,” said Ms. Tambini, who lives on Staten Island. “Easter is next weekend and we’re having people down who wanted to come and see the new expanded beach.”Ruth Bauer is annoyed because she cannot take her daily walks along the beach.“I don’t think they’re going to detonate after sitting in saltwater at the bottom of the ocean for 50 years,” said Ms. Bauer, who has owned a house here since 1965.But Tim Rider, a spokesman for the 754th Ordnance Company at Fort Monmouth, where the objects were taken, said some of the recovered munitions contained unexploded powder. If detonated, Mr. Rider said, the devices could still maim or even kill.“Everything has to be treated like it is an explosive,” Mr. Watson of the Corps said.The unwelcome discovery came at the end of the first phase of a controversial $71 million beach replenishment project planned for most of the towns on Long Beach Island.The discovery of the munitions is hardly the project’s first stumbling block. Surfers up and down the island have voiced concern that the replenishment would alter wave patterns, and homeowners of multimillion-dollar beachfront houses in communities to the north and south are distraught because the project will leave a 22-foot-high sand dune blocking their view.So far, Surf City is the only town on the island where all necessary easements have been granted to allow the project to move forward.Mr. Watson acknowledged that this latest development could add fuel to the arguments of those opposed to the replenishment, although he said that in the next phases screens would be placed over the intake valves on the sand pumps.“That’s the nature of this island,” he said. “You’re going to have some people against it, and some people for it. But it’s a positive project and it’s vital to get it done for all the communities.”'"
"'07-04-03,'1','When Payne was named last May as the replacement for Johnson, he said that any urge to rejoice was tempered by solemn feelings. He walked upstairs to Johnson’s second-floor office and did not move a painting or piece of furniture. The only difference in the décor, he said, is the Payne family pictures where Johnson’s once stood.“In a celebratory moment, I was already thinking down the road,” Payne said in a recent telephone interview. “I was thinking, I better not mess this up, I better do the best I can to maintain the quality of this tournament that has been maintained by my predecessors. It weighed heavily on me. The responsibility came pretty quickly, and it remains.”There is intensity and humor to Payne, a standout defensive end at the University of Georgia, a lawyer and an investment banker who dreamed of an Atlanta Olympics after church services in February 1987.Against long odds, Payne and a group of friends delivered the Games, only for the event to be marred by a bombing, a chaotic downtown bazaar that snarled traffic and, later, a Congressional investigation into Atlanta’s bid after the scandal uncovered in Salt Lake City’s bid to gain the 2002 Winter Games.“That we sold Olympic sponsorships and did that in excess, I say guilty as charged; we had no other choice,” A. D. Frazier, the chief operating officer for the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, said in a telephone interview last week. “I could have used $75 million and gotten good buses, but I wasn’t going to go broke. Billy hated the fact that we didn’t have every possible dollar to spend on those things that would have been wonderful to have, but we just didn’t have the dough, and we did the best we could with the dough we had.”Payne said, “I remember as we were begging for sponsorship and support, my dear friend Andy Young would say, ‘Don’t beg, just tell them how great it’s going to be.’ ” Payne was referring to Andrew Young, the former mayor of Atlanta who worked with him on the bid. “Through a lot of hard work and luck, we were able to raise a lot of money,” Payne said.He added: “Our goal was to introduce the American South for the first time ever. It was known only for Civil War and civil rights. Now it is known as one of the most vibrant cities with some of the nicest people you will ever meet.”Price said that the investigation into the Atlanta Olympics was one of the rare moments he saw Payne hurt and concerned.“The Salt Lake City scandal brought a lot of secondary publicity to Atlanta,” Price said. “I got the impression that he was much more concerned about that because it dealt with him personally, his reputation, and it was out of his hands. I don’t think Billy, being an honest person, did anything underhanded. He has a tremendous amount of self-confidence and also a human side, a very high level of sensitivity to what people think and how people think of him.”It is not yet clear how that sensitivity will manifest itself behind Augusta’s green gates. Payne is the first chairman not to have met Clifford Roberts and Bobby Jones, the club’s founders, who created a beloved tournament and an exclusive brotherhood.Payne, 59, is nearly 17 years younger than Johnson, who once rejected a call to admit a woman member by stating, “There may well come a day when women will be invited to join our membership, but that timetable will be ours, and not at the point of a bayonet.”How might Payne handle the membership question?“My guess is pressure from whatever source will not determine what his decision will be,” Frazier said. “He will make his decision on what he thinks is best for the Masters and the traditions that are there. He will never be unkind or rude, but he is not going to be browbeaten into some sort of position.”Price, who continues to share church services with Payne, said he was not sure how the new chairman might address the membership issue.“I’m looking forward to seeing that myself,” Price said. “There is an awful lot, the sex and racial issues, women and minorities; it’s a very tough thing he’s getting into.“I think everything Billy does will be a reflection of his integrity, of his faith, and how he understands it.”'"
"'07-04-03,'1','A man accused in an elaborate federal sting operation of plotting to provide training and money to terrorists pleaded guilty yesterday to attending a training camp run by the Pakistani terror group Lashkar-e-Taiba in 2002.The man, Mahmud Faruq Brent, a paramedic from Washington, was one of four men accused in the plot and the first to make a deal with federal prosecutors. His lawyer, Hassen ibn Abdellah, said that Mr. Brent would not testify against his co-defendants and that he pleaded guilty only to have his potential sentence cut almost in half, to a maximum of 15 years.The plea by Mr. Brent, 32, is the latest episode in a case that began in May 2005, with the arrest of Tarik Shah, a New York jazz musician and martial arts expert, who stands charged with swearing an oath of allegiance to Al Qaeda. Mr. Shah, who grew up in the Bronx and spent his allowance on Cannonball Adderley records, is accused of offering hand-to-hand combat training to jihadists. He is also accused of offering training to Mr. Brent when they lived in Beacon, N.Y., in 2001.An associate of Mr. Shah’s, Rafiq Sabir, a doctor from Boca Raton, Fla., was charged with offering medical assistance to potential Al Qaeda operatives. A fourth man, Abdulrahman Farhane, a Brooklyn bookseller, is accused of plotting with an F.B.I. informant to send money overseas to buy weapons and communications equipment for Muslims fighting United States forces in Afghanistan.All three men pleaded not guilty to charges resulting from the sting operation, in which the F.B.I. informant posed as a recruiter for Al Qaeda.'"
"'07-04-03,'1','Biomet, an orthopedics maker based in Warsaw, Ind., has announced preliminary findings from an internal investigation of options backdating at the company from 1996 through last year. It also said that Daniel P. Hann, its vice president for administration and former general counsel, had resigned.Biomet said in a regulatory filing that Mr. Hann and Gregory D. Hartman, who resigned Friday as chief financial officer, knew or should have known of the backdating and the potential “ramifications.”It was an unexpected comedown for Mr. Hann, 51, who had served as Biomet’s interim president and chief executive for a year until the appointment a week ago of Jeffrey R. Blinder, a former Abbott Laboratories executive, to run the company.The arrival of Mr. Blinder, 43, meant that Mr. Hann might not have stayed for long anyway. But the hasty departure appears to have limited his severance. Among other things, Mr. Hann will forfeit 164,000 in unvested stock options and surrender any right to have the vesting of other options accelerated because of his retirement, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission made public today.Mr. Hann also agreed to pay back any excess profits he gained from misdating of options he received once Biomet figures out what sums are involved. If necessary to meet accounting requirements, he will pay more for options that have vested but not yet been exercised.'"
"'07-04-03,'1','Episodic memory was also unique to our species, Dr. Tulving maintained. For one thing, he argued that episodic memory required self-awareness. You can’t remember yourself if you don’t know you exist. He also argued that there was no evidence animals could recollect experiences, even if those experiences left an impression on them.Many animal behavior experts agreed with Dr. Tulving, even though they had not actually run experiments testing the idea. But when Nicola Clayton, a comparative psychologist, first heard about the claim, she had a different reaction. “I could feel my feathers ruffling,” said Dr. Clayton, who is now at the University of Cambridge. “I thought, hang on, that doesn’t make sense.”Dr. Clayton began to test western scrub jays to see if they met any of the criteria for episodic memory. The jays can hide several thousand pieces of food each year and remember the location of each one. Dr. Clayton wondered if scrub jays simply remembered locations, or if they remembered the experience of hiding the food.She ran an experiment using two kinds of food: moth larvae and peanuts. Scrub jays prefer larvae to peanuts while the larvae are still fresh. When the larvae are dead for a few hours, the jays prefer peanuts. Dr. Clayton gave the birds a chance to hide both kinds of food and then put them in another cage. She later returned the birds to their caches, in some cases after four hours and in other cases after five days.The time the scrub jays spent away from their caches had a big effect on the type of food they looked for. The birds that waited four hours tended to dig up larvae, and the birds that had to wait for five days passed the larvae by and dug up peanuts instead. (To make sure they were not just picking up the smell of rotten larvae and avoiding those spots, Dr. Clayton dumped out the caches as soon as the birds had made them, and filled all of them with fresh sand.)In 1998, Dr. Clayton and her colleagues published the results of their experiment, declaring that scrub jays met the standards for “episodic-like” memory. Ever since, Dr. Clayton has been investigating the memories of scrub jays more deeply. Last year, for example, her team discovered that scrub jays not only remember when and where they hide food, but also whether they are being watched at the time. If one scrub jay notices another one watching it hide food, it tends to dig up the cache later and hide it somewhere else. Other scientists have followed Dr. Clayton’s lead and have searched for signs of episodic-like memory in other animals. When rats are exploring a maze, for example, they seem to be able to recall which kinds of food they encountered along the way. Hummingbirds seem to remember where and when they visited individual flowers for nectar. Rhesus monkeys can remember where they put food, but not how long ago they put it there.Some researchers have not been persuaded by these studies, however.“Animals seem to be living very much in the present,” said Thomas Suddendorf, a comparative psychologist at the University of Queensland in Australia.Dr. Suddendorf argues that a scrub jay could remember type of food along with the location of a cache without having a sense or memory of self. “Information is not really what characterizes mental time travel,” Dr. Suddendorf said. “I know that in 1967 in Sweden my mom gave birth to me, but that doesn’t mean I can travel back to that time and experience that event.”Episodic memory also depends on many other faculties that have only been clearly documented in the human mind, Dr. Suddendorf argues. He said he believes it evolved after our ancestors branched off from other apes. The advantage lay not in knowing the past, however, but in providing “an advantage for predicting the future,” he said.Recent brain scanning studies support Dr. Suddendorf’s link between the past and future. Daniel Schacter, a psychologist, and his colleagues at Harvard University recently studied how brains function as people think about past experiences and imagine future ones. Constructing an episodic memory causes a distinctive network of brain regions to become active. As a person then adds details to the memory, the network changes, as some regions quiet down and others fire up.The researchers then had their subjects think about themselves in the future. Many parts of the episodic memory network became active again.Dr. Suddendorf argues that these overlapping networks for mental time travel evolved at least 1.6 million years ago. He points to stone tools hominids made at that time. Paleoanthropologists have determined that the tools were moved many miles from where they were made.“If you’ve just eaten, the only reason you’re going to take a tool with you is if you anticipate using it in the future,” he said.Dr. Suddendorf has roused comparative psychologists to action — “like a red rag to a bull,” as one comparative psychologist, Sara Shettleworth of the University of Toronto, put it. They have been looking for evidence that animals can also plan for the future.Some studies suggest not. Cebus monkeys, for example, will eat until they are stuffed and throw the rest of the food out of their cage, despite the fact that they will not have food the next morning.But in other studies, animals show more promise. “We tested squirrel monkeys to see if they could anticipate the future, and to our surprise it looks like they could,” said Dr. William Roberts, a comparative psychologist at the University of Western Ontario. He and his colleagues ran a test in which they offered squirrel monkeys a choice between one piece of date or four. Not surprisingly, the monkeys took four.But the scientists then began to take away water from the monkeys before they offered the choice. If the monkeys took four pieces, the scientists kept the water away for three hours. If the monkeys took one, the scientists returned the water in half an hour. The monkeys learned to choose one date. Even though they were not thirsty at the time, they anticipated becoming thirsty in the future. (If the scientists stopped withholding water, the monkeys went back to picking four pieces of dates instead of one.)Dr. Clayton recently tested her scrub jays for foresight. She and her colleagues put the birds in three adjoining compartments for six days. Each morning the birds were shut for two hours in one of two rooms. In one room they got nothing to eat. In the other room, they got powdered pine nuts (the scrub jays can eat the powder, but they cannot cache it). For the rest of the day, each bird could move around all three rooms and enjoy more powdered nuts.On the seventh day, the scientists switched the powdered pine nuts with real ones. If the birds were so inclined, they could cache the pine nuts in ice cube trays the scientists put in the two morning rooms. “If I’m a bird, what I could do is take some of the provisions and hide it in there so that if I do wake up there in the morning, I can get my own breakfast,” Dr. Clayton said.Dr. Clayton found that the birds put over three times more pine nuts in the no-breakfast room than in the breakfast room. She argues that the results mean that birds can take action for their future needs, knowing what they’ll need and where they’ll need it.Other experts on animal behavior say that the study is compelling. Even Dr. Suddendorf, who has been so critical of previous studies, is intrigued by Dr. Clayton’s results. He said he wonders how long the birds can plan ahead: “Can they do this for an event next week or next month like humans can? Is it limited to caching, to just food?”“It’s good to see people waking up to this,” Dr. Suddendorf said. “In five years the picture is going to look a lot clearer. The future looks bright for research on the future.”'"
"'07-04-03,'1','His co-authors were Mark F. Schmitz of Temple University, Allan V. Horwitz of Rutgers University, and Dr. Michael B. First, a psychiatrist at Columbia who edited the current version of the psychiatric association’s diagnostic manual.The study’s findings suggest that previous estimates of the number of Americans who suffer depression at least once during their lives — more than 30 million — are about 25 percent too high.Dr. Darrel Regier, director of research for the American Psychiatric Association, said, “I think the concern this study raises is real, and that we do need to be very careful not to overdiagnose a normal, homeostatic response to loss and call it a disorder.” But he added that depression checklists had in fact helped identify people in need of treatment.The researchers analyzed responses from 8,098 adults to survey questions posed between 1990 and 1992. The questions were based on diagnostic criteria for mood problems and asked people who reported a period of sadness if they remembered any event that might have caused it, like the death of a loved one or a divorce.The diagnostic manual makes a distinction between severe bereavement that precipitates lasting depression, which is rare, and normal grief, which looks like depression but usually loosens its hold in a few weeks or months.The researchers found 56 people in the survey who suffered this normal reaction after the death of someone close. Another 174 people struggled with normal levels of distress after a different kind of blow, like the breakup of a relationship or a lost job — a group that would qualify for a diagnosis of depression under the current definition.The investigators then compared the two groups’ answers to questions about nine kinds of depression symptoms, including a loss of appetite, sleeping problems and thoughts about suicide. The only significant difference, they found, was that those grieving a death were twice as likely as those digesting another kind of loss to have thoughts about death or suicide.“The profile you get for these two groups is so very, very close,” Dr. Wakefield said, that it does not justify the exclusion of one group and not the other in the depression diagnosis.The authors draw no conclusions about the study’s implications for treatment. Doctors often treat even normal grief reactions if patients are in some pain. But such patients should not be identified as having depression, the authors conclude.'"
"'07-04-03,'1','Children who suffer a head injury are much more likely to have another one within six months, researchers reported Monday. The big question is why.Writing in Pediatrics, the researchers said the children they had studied were twice as likely as other children to injure their heads again. The study was led by Bonnie R. Swaine of the University of Montreal.Until now, the study said, there has been some circumstantial evidence suggesting that one head injury predisposes children to another. Trying to determine if this was really the case, the researchers looked at what happened to more than 11,800 children, ages 1 to 18, who came to two pediatric emergency rooms over a little more than two years for treatment of a head injury.Although the researchers were unable to establish what kind of children were at most risk to be injured again — beyond the well-known fact that boys are more likely to have injuries than girls — they suggested that repeated injuries probably involved a “complex interaction between children and their personal and social environments.”To begin with, a mild head injury can cause continuing problems that may not be obvious. “Even subtle deficits in coordination, balance or endurance,” the study said, “combined with cognitive and behavioral limitations, might reduce a child’s ability to meet the demands of a difficult task.”It may also be, the researchers said, that the children who are injured again are exposed to more hazardous environments or have less parental supervision.'"
"'07-04-03,'1','“From a child development perspective, children need access to an environment that allows them to play out what is natural to them — physical, dramatic, constructive and spontaneous games,” Joe L. Frost, an emeritus professor of education at the University of Texas who is an expert on play and playgrounds around the world, said in an interview. “But in our high-tech society, children go indoors right after school and eat junk food and play video games.”No wonder this nation is suffering from an epidemic of childhood depression and obesity.The Value of PlayA report in the journal Pediatrics in January by Dr. Kenneth R. Ginsburg and two committees of the American Academy of Pediatrics summed up the importance of free play to a child’s development. It made these points:¶Play allows children to use their creativity while developing their imagination, dexterity, and physical, cognitive and emotional strength.¶Play allows children to create and explore a world they can master, conquering their fears while practicing adult roles.¶Play helps children develop new competencies that lead to enhanced confidence and the resiliency they will need to face challenges.¶Undirected play allows children to learn how to work in groups, to share, to negotiate and to resolve conflicts.¶Some play must remain child-driven, with parents either not present or as passive observers. When play is child-driven, children practice decision-making, move at their own pace, discover their own areas of interest and ultimately engage fully in the passions they wish to pursue.¶When play is controlled by adults, children acquiesce to adult rules and concerns and lose some benefits of play, particularly in developing creativity, leadership and group skills.¶Above all, play is a simple joy that is a cherished part of childhood.Franklin Stone, a lawyer, community activist and former director of the nonprofit public policy group Common Good, is concerned about the effects that litigation is having on children’s access to free play.“For fear of lawsuits, we’ve created a bubble-wrapped society,” Ms. Stone said. “Fear of litigation has resulted in the ‘dumbing down’ of playgrounds and the closing of sledding hills and hiking trails. We’ve made playgrounds immensely safe for 3-, 4- and 5-year-olds, but they’re boring for 8-, 9- and 10-year-olds, who are on the streets with their skateboards.“New playgrounds today have only bucket swings for babies, no monkey bars or high slides or seesaws,” Ms. Stone added. “Yet children are much more likely to be injured from almost everything else — from beds, pots and pans, TVs, organized sports — than they are in a playground.“We need to re-evaluate safety guidelines to see if we’ve gone too far. And we need to consider legal protection for those who offer opportunities for play — the schools, churches and community organizations who are now afraid of being sued if a child gets hurt.”Children have to learn to take reasonable physical and social risks if they are to become the confident grown-ups parents want them to be. If children are constantly being told not to do things because it’s too dangerous or they might get hurt, parents are teaching them that they are weak, Ms. Stone said.Last year my grandson, who was 5, broke his arm when he fell from a climbing structure in the schoolyard. As soon as his arm healed, he was back climbing, even standing on the top of the structure. I remembered when his father (my son) was just a year or two older and fell out of a tree, scraped his chest and said not a word to his parents. The next day, he was back in the tree.Susan G. Solomon, author of “American Playgrounds: Revitalizing Community Space,” said: “Children need a chance to take acceptable risks, learn cause and effect, make choices and see consequences. If they don’t learn to take risks, we’ll lose a generation of entrepreneurs and scientists.”New vs. Old IdeasA recent proposal to create playgrounds in New York City that offer sand and water and various portable objects that are overseen by a trained play worker revives a concept that prevailed here in the 1920s and is still practiced in Europe. But it has drawn some devastating criticism from parents and others who say children don’t need adults “directing” their play.Rhonda L. Clements, a professor of education at Manhattanville College in Purchase, N.Y., and the author of nine books on children’s play, called it an exciting and much-needed concept.The idea, she said, has been misunderstood. Play workers don’t tell children how to play. Rather, they provide the equipment for imaginative play that gives children of different ages, ethnic backgrounds and skill levels a chance to interact with and learn from one another, unlike traditional playgrounds that are more isolating.Also crucial, the authors of the Pediatrics report wrote, is more parent-child playtime. Some of the best interactions occur when parents work on a hobby or play sports with their children or become fully immersed in child-centered play.The results can be surprising. In addition to having fun, my grandsons, now in first grade, have learned how to multiply and divide by playing Monopoly with their father.'"
"'07-04-03,'1','And more people, and more airplanes, are being squeezed into an infrastructure — including airports and the Federal Aviation Administration’s air traffic control system — that wasn’t built to accommodate such a load.In its recently released forecast for 2007-20, the F.A.A. predicts that the domestic commercial airliner fleet will grow to 11,203 in 2020 from 7,626 this year. That does not include growth in the number of business jets, currently more than 6,000, or the anticipated surge in the so-called very light business and personal jets, which the F.A.A. has said will add 5,000 more aircraft to the skies in 10 years.While the airlines get the blame, “These delays are inextricably linked with the government’s outdated and inefficient air traffic control system,” said James C. May, the president of the Air Transport Association.It’s clear that more business travelers are choosing to drive rather than fly. Will Allen III, a Raleigh, N.C., management consultant who is on the road five days a week, monitored delays piling up at O’Hare International Airport one day in March, and decided instead to drive from Raleigh to Chicago, renting a Toyota Avalon for the 1,700-mile round trip.Mr. Allen is a kind of business traveler Everyman, and I take his temperature on occasion. I’ve never heard him sound so unhappy about air travel.“The next time I feel I’m being held hostage by the airlines, I’m calling Hertz,” he said.Speaking of being held hostage, Frank Yurasko and his wife, Rosalee, of Redington Beach, Fla., were among passengers on a Royal Air Maroc flight from Kennedy to Casablanca on March 16 who, by my calculation, hold the 2006-7 record for time held on board a parked airliner.“Sixteen and a half hours in the plane, which I think is a record-setting event,” said Mr. Yurasko, a retired trial lawyer. The weather that night was snowy, and planes were stacked up for de-icing procedures that ultimately broke down after passengers boarded around 7 p.m.As the night wore on and the plane sat on a ramp, away from the gate, “people were sleeping on the floor of the airplane,” he said. Dinner was served, but after that for the rest of the 16 ½ hours, “there were no further offers of water or anything else, let alone food,” he said.“They kept saying, ‘We’re waiting for clearance; we’re waiting for clearance.’ They had on board a continental breakfast, but didn’t serve that, though some of our seatmates saw the flight attendants eating breakfasts in the back,” he said.“The flight attendants had given up on looking after the passengers and stopped making announcements. When the flight was finally canceled, and was moving back to the gate on an active runway, people were milling around; nobody was in their seats.”Passengers were given $15 for lunch “at McDonalds or the Wok & Roll” at the airport, and then boarded on a flight the next evening. Total travel time, New York to Morocco: 60 hours.“Air service in general is deteriorating,” Mr. Yurasko said in the understatement of the year so far.'"
"'07-04-03,'1','Many analysts viewed the deal, announced in London by EMI’s chief, Eric L. Nicoli, and Apple’s chief, Steven P. Jobs, as a first step in a broader shift toward all music being sold without antipiracy software. Some expressed hope it could also jumpstart digital sales for the music industry. Since the start of the year, the slide in plastic CD sales has accelerated, down more than 20 percent, according to Nielsen SoundScan data.“Things will never be the same,” said Phil Leigh, a senior analyst at Inside Digital Media, a Florida-based research company.But others suggest that the partnership is a more isolated instance of two companies joining up amid overlapping agendas. EMI has been working to right itself after a management shake-up and a series of setbacks, including two profit warnings this year. Apple, for its part, has been trying to resolve complaints from European consumer advocates, who say its system should be made to work with rivals’ hardware and software.Apple may yet have more headaches looming, however. European Commission officials confirmed yesterday that the company — and the major record companies — are facing an antitrust inquiry over the pricing of songs on the iTunes service.Jonathan Todd, spokesman for Neelie Kroes, the European Union’s competition commissioner, said in Brussels that Apple and several of the major music companies, including EMI, Warner and Universal, were being investigated over concerns that the sale of music through iTunes flouts the union’s antitrust regulations.Mr. Todd said the commission last week sent a formal “statement of objections” to Apple and the record companies contending that iTunes was breaching competition rules by preventing consumers in one country from downloading songs more cheaply from the Apple Internet store in another country. He said this violated antitrust rules because prices differed across the 27-member bloc, limiting consumer choice.The use of copy protection software has meant in practice that songs purchased from iTunes can be played only on the company’s iPod. Apple has declined to share its proprietary protection software with competing companies, effectively locking them out of the iPod. As a result, some music labels have considered dropping their demand for protection software altogether to allow rival music services to sell music that could play on Apple’s device.While some of EMI’s rivals have been testing sales of music in unprotected form, the company’s move did not appear to prompt any immediate retreat from antipiracy software. A spokesman for Warner Music Group declined to comment but referred back to comments made in February by the company’s chief executive, Edgar Bronfman Jr., who said, “There is no reason to conclude that music is the one content category that should not or cannot be protected simply because there is an unprotected legacy product available,” referring to CDs.Representatives for the two bigger music companies — the Universal Music Group of Vivendi and Sony BMG, a partnership between Sony and Bertelsmann — declined to comment yesterday.Mr. Jobs, however, was unequivocal in his prediction that the industry would eventually reduce its use of copy protection. He said that he expected more than half of the songs on iTunes would be available in unprotected versions by year’s end.Apple executives predicted the new structure would lead to a surge in sales, but if it did not, the company might benefit by soothing tensions with European authorities. Critics ranging from Norway’s principal consumer rights group to lawmakers in France have taken Apple to task — and to court — for making music purchased from iTunes compatible only with the iPod.Some of the Europeans most critical of Mr. Jobs and iTunes praised the move yesterday. “Today marks the beginning of a new era — an era where the entertainment industry works with the customer and not against them,” Torgeir Waterhouse, a senior adviser in Norway’s Consumer Council, said in a statement.The music companies had resisted freeing up their digital tracks from restrictions because they were afraid consumers would make copious copies that would deprive the companies and their recording artists of revenue.But peer-to-peer Internet services that freely trade music files have flourished anyway, with 5 billion downloads last year, compared with 509 million songs downloaded from official digital music services, according to NPD Group.Mr. Nicoli said early market tests showed EMI that consumers overwhelmingly preferred to purchase tracks without copy protection, even at a higher cost. Unrestricted tracks outsold the others at a rate of 10 to one, Mr. Nicoli said.Mr. Jobs emphasized how much the music labels had benefited from sales over iTunes. The service, he said, “has brought more than $1 billion in revenues to the record companies at no addition cost to them.”To some in the music industry, though, EMI’s move only punctuated the fact that the industry has failed to build a more robust digital business after years of watching its sales base crumble.“This appears to be the final acknowledgment on the record companies’ part that the guiding principles of their digital distribution strategies have been fundamentally flawed,” said Ken Hertz, a longtime music industry lawyer who represents artists including Beyoncé and the Black Eyed Peas.Mr. Hertz said injecting higher prices into iTunes would drive more consumers to download music from unlicensed free services. “The consumer’s conscience, which is all we had left, that’s gone, too.”'"

"'07-04-04,'1','In Todd Holland’s “Firehouse Dog” a pampered Hollywood pooch trades his movie-star lifestyle for a run-down firehouse sadly in need of a mascot and some esprit de corps. It’s not long before the resourceful animal is counseling a motherless boy and his neglectful father, saving the firehouse from being closed and tracking down a serial arsonist. Whatever they were paying this mutt, it wasn’t enough.When a 12-year-old, Shane Fahey (Josh Hutcherson), first encounters the bedraggled Dewey, a k a Rexxx — a stage name suggesting a rather more adult movie career — he’s unimpressed. But Shane is lonely; his father (Bruce Greenwood), a fire captain, is preoccupied with budget cuts and depressed by the recent death of his brother, and it’s easy for Dewey to capture the boy’s heart by defecating in his lunch and passing gas on his bed. Lifelong marriages have been based on less.As Dewey works to resolve father-son issues and improve Shane’s grades, Mr. Holland and his cadre of writers fill the screen with generic supporting players and some satisfyingly gritty action sequences. Working with four interchangeable Deweys, the filmmakers create a sufficient number of lively stunts to keep the kiddies amused, though the film’s wittiest moment — a canine parody of Dudley Moore’s first glimpse of Bo Derek in “10” — will be appreciated only by their parents.

"'07-04-04,'1','At least 300 bills have been filed in 40 states that address heat-trapping gases and climate change in some form, said Adela Flores-Brennan, a policy analyst with the National Conference of State Legislatures.In Washington, Congress has already begun a process that would eventually apportion both the responsibility for cuts in emissions that could cost tens of billions of dollars and the benefits and incentives that could mean billions of dollars of new income.“Obviously, nobody wants to bear a disproportionate share of the burden,” said Representative Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts and chairman of the newly created House Select Committee on Energy Independence and Global Warming. “It’s now going to be a multidimensional chess game with the planet’s future in the balance.”The way legislation apportions emissions cuts among industries — and, as important, how the credits earned by companies that reduce emissions are allocated — will be the focus of the lobbying, said Mr. Markey and lobbyists for environmental groups and industry.“It’s incumbent on everyone to roll their sleeves up, if they haven’t already, to deal seriously with this problem,” said Luke Popovich of the National Mining Association, the trade group for the coal mine operators who will be at the center of the lobbying. “If pain concentrates the mind, there will be more concentration on the issue now.”Coal is the major source of electricity in more than half the states, and coal is the fuel most closely associated with high levels of emissions of carbon dioxide. And coal interests have a bipartisan audience. The United Mine Workers is a natural Democratic constituency, while the National Mining Association has been a reliable supporter of the Bush administration.“There are differences within the industry,” Mr. Popovich said, “but we are allied in favor of a solution that preserves coal’s growth in the United States.”Next to the electric-utility sector, which is responsible for about 40 percent of emissions of heat-trapping gases, Mr. Markey said, comes the transportation sector, which contributes roughly 30 percent.The auto industry has long opposed increases in fuel-efficiency standards, which automatically mean a reduction in heat-trapping gases. The oil industry has resisted controls on carbon dioxide emissions. Until recently, the two industries, while occasionally sniping at each other, had avoided explicit endorsement of the regulation that was most feared by the other.But, with the likelihood of Congressional action increasing, that informal nonaggression pact has ended. Executives of the Big Three auto companies testifying in the House last month explicitly supported regulation of carbon dioxide. And a senior oil industry executive earlier this year gave a speech advocating increases in fuel economy.The Supreme Court found Monday that the Environmental Protection Agency had erred in justifying its decision not to regulate carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping gases. The court said that by providing nothing more than a “laundry list of reasons not to regulate,” the agency had defied the Clean Air Act’s “clear statutory command.” The ruling also said that the agency could not sidestep its authority to regulate heat-trapping gases unless it could provide a scientific basis for its refusal to do so.In Congress, controls on automobile emissions remain a work in progress. In more than a dozen states, beginning with California in 2002, they have become a fact — although these laws have been stayed pending legal challenges. Those challenges were greatly weakened, however, by the Supreme Court ruling.“States are not going to wait,” said Dennis McLerran, executive director of the Puget Sound Clean Air Agency, created by Washington State. “States are going to continue to act on this. If there is some confusion from this or if it creates greater pressure on Congress, then that’s all to the good.”Washington is among more than a dozen states that have followed California’s lead in setting goals to restrict carbon dioxide emissions, and it is one of five Western states that have formed an alliance to combat climate change. States in the Northeast have formed a similar alliance.Several environmental leaders said the court decision could persuade still other states to pass climate-change legislation.Terry Tamminen, the former secretary of the California Environmental Protection Agency under Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger and now a private consultant to states pursuing California-style caps on emissions, said he had recently worked with elected leaders in Wisconsin, South Carolina, Florida and Maryland. Some of these states are more conservative than states in the West and Northeast and have not been strongly associated with efforts to restrict pollution. The court ruling, Mr. Tamminen suggested, “will give cover for those Republicans who feel they need to take action.”“They can say, ‘Look, the debate is now over,’ ” he said.California has been in the vanguard, first with its bill to regulate carbon dioxide emissions from vehicle tailpipes in 2002, and then with its landmark 2006 law requiring a 25 percent reduction in the state’s carbon dioxide emissions by 2020.Arizona, New Mexico, Oregon and Washington have joined California to pursue a regional plan to cut emissions. The idea is to make it profitable for industries to pursue pollution reduction through cap-and-trade plans that would allow companies with emissions lower than the allowed caps to sell credits to companies that exceed them.Most of the legislation in Congress follows the cap-and-trade model.Outside the West and the Northeast, states are still finding their way. In North Carolina, government commissions are weighing measures like restricting auto emissions and establishing so-called renewable portfolios, which many states are proposing as a way to balance their energy supply between carbon-producing fuels like coal, oil and natural gas, and clean, renewable fuel sources like wind and solar power.In Illinois, Gov. Rod R. Blagojevich has proposed restricting carbon emissions to 60 percent of 1990 levels by the year 2050, said Steve Frenkel, an aide to the governor.“You’ve seen a lot of leadership coming out of the coasts,” Mr. Frenkel said. “Looking in the Midwest, where there’s a lot of coal and industrial pollution, how we handle this here is important for how we handle this nationally.”With about half the states getting at least 50 percent of their electric power from coal, Congress will have to wrestle with the disproportionate impact that climate change legislation could have around the country.“You’ve got 35 senators reliably for a pretty strong program,” said David Doniger, a lawyer with the Natural Resources Defense Council. “How do you get that to 50 or 60? You have to get senators who come from states where coal is important, autos are important and agriculture is important.”'"
"'07-04-04,'1','DoubleClick, based in New York, views the exchange as the centerpiece of a growth plan and may derive the majority of revenue from the new service within five years, said David Rosenblatt, the company’s chief executive, said in an interview yesterday. “We already have the largest sellers and the largest buyers,” he said. “This will link them for the first time.”He described the exchange as a mix of eBay and Sabre, the airline reservations system that travel agents use. The service will let advertisers see information about what competitors bid for particular ads, in the same way that eBay shows visitors past bids. And it will let publishers try to ensure that they sell their ad spots at the highest possible price, the way that airlines try to do with the seats they sell.“The value of our company depends completely on our ability to maximize our customers’ revenue,” Mr. Rosenblatt said.Some of the biggest names on the Internet appear to have already seen the value in DoubleClick’s service — or its potential. Google and Microsoft are pursuing bids to buy the company, according to The Wall Street Journal, which said that DoubleClick’s owner, the private equity firm Hellman & Friedman, has priced DoubleClick at more than $2 billion. Hellman & Friedman, which paid $1.1 billion for the company in July 2005, did not return a call for comment last night.The online advertisement exchange will make DoubleClick more attractive to a potential acquirer because there is much demand for such a service and little supply, industry executives said. One of the few companies that runs this kind of auction, Right Media, took in $40 million last October when it sold a 20 percent stake to Yahoo.“If you want to be a network in this kind of market, the biggest challenge you face is access to publisher-side supply,” said Michael Walrath, chief executive of Right Media of New York. “So ad management — providing the trafficking and delivery services to publishers — is a really nice foot in the door to gaining access to those publishers’ supply.”Historically, ads in traditional media like television and magazines have been purchased through human negotiation. But the auctions introduced by Internet companies like Google and Yahoo for search advertising have forced some advertising executives to look for more efficient ways to sell ads. Now some of the biggest names on the Internet, including Google and eBay, are seeking to participate more broadly in advertising auctions.DoubleClick’s revenue in 2006 was about $300 million, but some industry executives said that the auction service the company was introducing made it worth much more.“Whoever gets them can immediately turn into an ad exchange business overnight,” said Dave Morgan, chairman of Tacoda, an online advertising network. “Two billion dollars will not be a stretch for that.”DoubleClick has signed up 35 Web publishers, advertising networks, agencies and advertisers to test the system, which should be up and running in the third quarter. Two of the testers are Advertising.com, a large ad network, and Media Contacts, an interactive media buyer that is part of Havas. DoubleClick will charge a commission for each ad impression traded on its exchange.DoubleClick serves — or delivers — the display ads on many large Web sites, including AOL and MySpace. It is those relationships with Web publishers that industry executives see as vital to the success of the exchange and to the courtship by companies like Google and Microsoft, which are trying for a broader foothold in online advertising.Google has reportedly offered Web publishers free ad management services — like those that DoubleClick charges for — in exchange for the ability to sell premium ads on their sites.Most of the ads for sale on existing exchanges are leftover space that big advertisers are not interested in, said Shelby Saville, a senior vice president at StarLink, a media buying firm within the Publicis Groupe.But, exchanges help add transparency, Ms. Saville said. Advertisers often do not know exactly which sites their ads run on with ad networks, and an exchange could remove some of that unknown factor, she said.DoubleClick will allow Web publishers to sell their ads on their sites without identifying themselves. Some Web publishers may want their ads sold along with the name of their sites, but others may not want advertisers to see that they sell ads at a lower price on the exchange than they do in traditional negotiations. And DoubleClick will let Web publishers hold private auctions in which they invite only select ad agencies or advertisers to bid on their ads.'"
"'07-04-04,'1','DENVER, April 3 (AP) — A former Qwest Communications president, considered a crucial government witness in the insider trading trial of Joseph P. Nacchio, testified repeatedly on Wednesday that he could not recall comments he made in 2000 and 2001 about the company’s financial performance.The former president, Afshin Mohebbi, described under cross-examination an aggressive corporate culture during Mr. Nacchio’s reign as chief executive at Qwest Communications International that pushed managers to exceed expectations in exchange for lucrative performance bonuses.Mr. Mohebbi acknowledged that he agreed with setting internal targets higher than publicly stated guidance as a way to bolster the performance of managers. He said he sent Mr. Nacchio brag sheets describing quarterly accomplishments that his operations had achieved, including meeting revenue targets in 2000 and the first quarter of 2001.But he repeatedly said he could not recall details in some e-mail messages sent or written by him or what he said during conferences with analysts in the spring of 2001, when, prosecutors say, Mr. Nacchio was illegally selling $101 million in stock.Mr. Mohebbi also said he did not see a Qwest document written that spring that was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. It stated that Mr. Mohebbi spoke to an analyst conference and was comfortable with the company’s public stated guidance.'"
"'07-04-04,'1','Mr. McCain has been identified throughout his career as an advocate of curbing the influence of money in politics, notably as a co-sponsor of a landmark bill limiting political contributions. He criticized Mr. Bush, when the two were opponents in 2000, as leading overly aggressive fund-raising efforts.Mr. McCain has also enlisted two senior advisers and put them in charge of a fund-raising effort that campaign aides described bluntly as being in disarray and without a single person in charge. They are Tom Loeffler, a former Texas congressman who was named the campaign’s national campaign finance chairman, and Steve Schmidt, who ran Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger’s most recent campaign in California.Mr. McCain’s aides said his problems arose because contributors, staff members — and perhaps Mr. McCain himself — had been lulled into complacency after a year in which they had systematically portrayed his nomination as inevitable.“This is a moment that has truly defined what needs to be done with respect to political fund-raising,” said Mr. Loeffler, whom Mr. McCain elevated to run the fund-raising effort at the first signs of trouble three weeks ago. “What it has shown for this team is that this is not a jog. This is a sprint.”John Weaver, Mr. McCain’s senior adviser, said: “We have a responsibility to make sure this doesn’t happen again and that we fix it. We take that seriously.”Mr. McCain held only three fund-raisers in January and February, they said. Mr. McCain’s aides said that they had spent Tuesday in conference calls with contributors across the country and that they were loading Mr. McCain’s schedule through the spring with fund-raisers to try to recover.At the same time, Mr. McCain will, upon his return from Iraq, deliver what his aides said would be a major speech at the Virginia Military Institute that will argue that the troop escalation was showing signs of success and urging Americans to back the war effort. The speech will take place on April 11, the day on which Mr. McCain had been scheduled to formally enter the race.The candidate’s coming speech on the war, too, comes as Democrats are assailing Mr. McCain as having an overly optimistic view of conditions in Iraq, where he toured a Baghdad market while clad in a bulletproof vest and protected by helicopters and armed guards.Democrats suggested that Mr. McCain had become so committed to building up forces, a stance he has long favored, and that he had linked his fortunes to the war so much that he failed to appreciate what was happening there now.Mr. McCain’s aides disputed that contention on Tuesday, saying that he was relying on the assessment provided by Gen. David H. Petraeus, commander of the American forces in Iraq. They said he was mainly chastising reporters in Baghdad as focusing on bad news coming out of that country, and disregarding what Mr. McCain said were encouraging turns of events there.“These are things that General Petraeus — not John McCain, but General Petraeus — says are happening that is encouraging,” said Mark Salter, a longtime senior adviser to Mr. McCain.Mr. McCain’s advisers said they expected that the senator would come under fire from opponents for turning to big money-raisers; he has already said the campaign would not take the federal funds that go to candidates who accept spending limits. But they called the criticisms unfair.“During the course of the campaign, there will be all manners of unfair criticism,” Mr. Schmidt said. “But John McCain’s record as a reformer — and as an agent for good government — stands second to none. He believes that people who give generously of their resources to causes they believe in is a good thing.”Joining Mr. Schmidt, Wayne Berman, a longtime supporter of Mr. Bush, has been named a vice chairman of the McCain campaign. Mr. Berman, like others of Mr. McCain’s advisers, said they were at a loss to explain why Mr. McCain had failed to hold more big-donor events early in the quarter, but said that would change now.“A lot of us on the fund-raising end gave advice which turned out to be wrong, which is we could do a lot of fund-raising without events,” Mr. Berman said. “We forgot — and I bear as much blame for this as anyone — that high-dollar presidential fund-raising is event-driven.”The McCain campaign is adopting many of the tools, like daily counts of fund-raising receipts and methodical tracking of the success of e-mail and general mail appeals. Those types of efforts were used extensively by Mr. Bush’s campaign in 2004.Mr. Weaver was dismissive of the success of Mitt Romney, the former governor of Massachusetts, who stunned many Republicans by raising more than $20 million, compared with $12.5 million for Mr. McCain and $15 million for a third major Republican candidate, Rudolph W. Giuliani. Mr. Weaver noted that Mr. Romney continued to trail in polls.“He’s raised about $7 million per Gallup point,” Mr. Weaver said. “He’s a great salesman, there’s no doubt about it.”'"
"'07-04-04,'1','Even as those in the middle of the current clash strategize about the next move, some figures central to the past fight say the differences are more pronounced than the similarities.“There were no Americans risking their lives at the Washington monument in 1995,” said Newt Gingrich, the Republican speaker at the time whom critics accused of badly overplaying his hand.“There were no Americans being shot at the Interior Department in 1995,” he said. “We were engaged in a domestic political debate over being serious over a balanced budget. The Democrats risk sending signals to our enemies that kidnapping British sailors and killing young Americans is acceptable.”Tom Daschle, the Senate minority leader in 1995, sees differences as well, but believes they play to Democratic strengths, with Mr. Bush defending an unpopular war and Democrats treading more carefully than did Mr. Gingrich and his coterie.“Newt Gingrich boasted of shutting the government down,” recalled Mr. Daschle. “He was proud of the fact he was doing that just to show his will. Republicans felt they had a mandate and could do what they wanted. I don’t think you could find a Democrat who thinks they have a mandate, but we do have a chance.”Almost from the beginning of the budget fight in 1995, Mr. Clinton’s poll numbers edged up and those of Mr. Gingrich, the Republican speaker of the House, dipped as the public perceived the president as the one trying to resolve the problem and Republicans as inflexible. One difference with 1995 was that in that episode, there was tangible fallout for Americans as parks and museums closed, benefit checks were delayed and an array of federal assistance was suspended.Today, the administration is making the case that the military will be denied resources, and some tours in Iraq might have to be extended if no bill is approved. But the Pentagon appears to have the flexibility to pay for operations at least through May and possibly longer with substantial juggling. Nevertheless, any event detrimental to the troops that could be tied to the impasse could cause a backlash for Democrats.Republicans say they continue to believe that much of the public still regards the president as the nation’s pre-eminent leader and that Congress should not meddle in White House business too deeply.“With us it was a bridge too far,” said Representative Jack Kingston, Republican of Georgia, recalling the duel with Mr. Clinton. “Tactically, we made a mistake and found the American people still liked the office of the presidency having some dominance. This is the Democrats’ government shutdown.”But Democrats say that Mr. Bush is operating in an atmosphere of deep skepticism and that he must fight his own low poll numbers as well as public frustration with the war — even though a recent survey showed a slight gain in optimism about Iraq.“We have had a chance to study 1995, and Democrats are bound and determined to make sure it won’t happen to them,” said Jim Manley, a spokesman for Senator Harry Reid, the majority leader. “Here we have a president seriously at odds with the American people.”Representative Rahm Emanuel of Illinois, the current chairman of the House Democratic Caucus and a senior aide in the Clinton administration, said Mr. Bush was retracing the missteps of Mr. Gingrich, courting conflict, while Mr. Clinton displayed a willingness to compromise.“President Clinton started off with, ‘Come on, let’s talk, let’s negotiate,’ ” said Mr. Emanuel. “President Bush has started off with confrontation.”Indeed, the White House has drawn a hard line, saying it will not legitimize a Democratic withdrawal plan of any sort by accepting it as part of legislation. Two Democrats said that Representative Nancy Pelosi, the House speaker, urged Mr. Bush to work with Democrats on the war while the two mingled in her office before a Capitol Rotunda ceremony last week; the Democrats said that Mr. Bush’s reply was essentially, “I am where I am.”Both sides are trying to exploit openings. Republicans, aware of Mr. Bush’s low standing, point to the added domestic spending in the House and Senate bills, trying to build resentment to pork-barrel projects. The White House is employing its presidential megaphone, particularly with Congress out of town for Easter. Mr. Bush took to the Rose Garden on Tuesday to warn of “significant consequences for our men and women in the armed forces.”Democrats immediately fired back, accusing the president of being out of touch with the public and calling on him to negotiate.“I saw a lot of what happened when my husband had a Republican Congress,” said Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, Democrat of New York, as she toured Iowa as part of her presidential campaign. “We would stake out one position, they would stake out one position. And then people would begin to try to figure out how to narrow the difference. That’s what should be happening here.”It is difficult to predict who will prevail. After all, no one foresaw in the fall of 1995 that a simple legislative dispute would end up stalling the momentum of a determined new majority and enhancing the standing of an embattled president.'"
"'07-04-04,'1','Still, NYSE Euronext is expected to face stiff competition from smaller and more nimble newcomers as well as from established rivals as they consolidate and as Europe introduces regulations allowing new rivals.Competition could also come from a group of banks that have pledged to set up a share-trading system known as Turquoise, adding to pressure on established exchanges to lower prices and capture new business.Mr. Thain emphasized that one motivation in forming NYSE Euronext was to win business from companies shying away from the United States, where strict regulations were introduced after a wave of accounting scandals. “If a company isn’t going to list in the U.S.,” he said, “we want them to list on Euronext.”But he also made the point that some Russian companies might not be welcomed. “We are very concerned about the quality of corporate governance” in Russia, Mr. Thain said. “I think with a number of Russian companies these things are called into question.”Mr. Thain and Mr. Théodore said they would welcome more European exchanges like Borsa Italiana in Milan as part of the so-called Euronext model, which has allowed cities like Brussels and Lisbon to retain their bourses while joining a Europe-wide system.But Mr. Thain said he saw the greatest opportunities for NYSE Euronext in China, where he expected the authorities to make it possible for foreign companies to own minority stakes in stock exchanges, perhaps within the next two years.“At the moment the Chinese government would not allow us to own a piece of, say, the Shanghai stock exchange,” he said. “That is what I hope will change over time.”NYSE Euronext already has a strategic alliance in Japan with the Tokyo Stock Exchange, and it owns a 5 percent stake in the National Stock Exchange of India.To overcome skepticism in Europe about domination of Euronext by the NYSE, the structure of the new company was finely balanced during negotiations last year. The American headquarters are in New York with the international headquarters in Paris and a center for derivatives operations in London, with other offices in Amsterdam, Brussels and Lisbon.The company has equal representation of Europeans and Americans on the board and management positions. When the chairman is European, the chief executive has to be American, and vice versa.'"
"'07-04-04,'1','But on Nov. 16, Michael Gennaro, Paper Mill’s president and chief executive, unexpectedly announced his resignation. The capital campaign “came to a grinding halt,” Mr. Thorn said. Almost none of the pledges have been collected, and ticket sales have not met projections.Mr. Gennaro, who is now the executive director of Trinity Repertory Company in Providence, R.I., said his departure should not be blamed for the theater’s current problems.“You give to an institution, not an individual,” he said. “I don’t understand why my departure would have any bearing on that.”Mr. Thorn said that the board had been confident that a bank loan, among some other measures, would cover this season’s shortfall, but the bank turned down the loan last Friday, abruptly leaving the rest of the season in doubt.Theater officials and trustees have managed to raise about $100,000 recently in new pledges from donors and subscribers, and they have approached another bank about a loan.And they are reaching deep into a talent pool of actors who have passed through Paper Mill, asking them to participate in a fund-raising performance being planned at the theater on Monday night. State officials and such Broadway stars as John Lloyd Young of the hit “Jersey Boys” are among those being invited.The theater’s financial emergency was reported yesterday in The Star-Ledger of Newark.Paper Mill officials offer many reasons for the financial emergency. One of them, they say, is the theater’s lopsided income model, which Mr. Gennaro sought to change after arriving at Paper Mill in April 2003.Revenue at nonprofit theaters is usually balanced between contributions and earned income from subscriptions and single ticket sales. But contributions make up only a fifth of the Paper Mill’s income in most years, and a consultant hired by the theater in 2004 reported that the board was not adequately leading the theater’s fund-raising efforts.“We have to change this dynamic or the theater will not survive,” said Diane Claussen, the theater’s managing director.In the early 1990s, when the Paper Mill had a reputation as a reliable place for classic musicals with high production values, it had about 42,000 subscribers, a number that has since dropped to 19,500.The main culprit was competition. Fifteen years ago, Broadway was in the doldrums and the Paper Mill was often the nearest alternative for big musical revivals. That began to change in the late 1990s with the renovation of Times Square. Since 1994, Broadway grosses have more than doubled.The theater’s real challenger arrived in 1997, when the New Jersey Performing Arts Center opened in Newark. The center became a stop for touring productions of war horse shows like “The Sound of Music” and “Fiddler on the Roof,” drawing theatergoers and millions of dollars in corporate support from the Paper Mill.“They’ve sort of sucked all the corporate money out,” said Ruthi Byrne, a member of the Paper Mill board. “The Paper Mill has been left high and dry.”In 2003, the board turned to Mr. Gennaro, the managing director at the acclaimed Steppenwolf Theater Company of Chicago, as well as a lawyer and actor with a show business lineage.Mr. Gennaro, who replaced Angelo del Rossi, a 40-year veteran of the Paper Mill, tried to draw a more diverse audience, mixing newer musicals and more obscure works. The few mainstream shows, like “Godspell,” sold out, but the more obscure works, like a new musical adaptation of “Harold and Maude,” did not do well.The schedule for next season — which includes “Meet Me in St. Louis,” “Kiss Me, Kate” and “Little Shop of Horrors” — has some of the familiar names that the subscribers seem to want. But, said Scott Fergang, who became a member of the board last year: “If we don’t have the money, then what do we do? Go out on the street?”'"
"'07-04-04,'1','“In accordance with our plans and our procedures,” the emergency director “had no choice but to declare a site-area emergency,” said Jeffrey T. Gasser, the executive vice president and chief nuclear officer of the Southern Nuclear Operating Company, which operates the Vogtle plant.The commission’s finding, Mr. Gasser said, would make the emergency manager in a real accident “take longer to evaluate conditions, before making a classification.” And that, he said, could delay putting an emergency plan into effect.But the commission said the emergency director and the control room crew should have responded to the indications in their simulator control room “in a methodical manner, assessing the event and utilizing the diagnostics in such a manner to ensure that ‘undue haste’ did not result in misdiagnosis, misoperation, or undesired plant conditions.”The indications that the emergency director used to diagnose a possible water leak were ambiguous. The water level in a reactor can fall for a variety of reasons; one is that when a reactor shuts down, its water cools and, like a piece of metal, shrinks.The radiation level in the containment building was up, according to the simulation, but that did not prove there was a leak, Mr. Gasser said, because the elevated readings came from water that was still inside the reactor. The water had higher readings because the fuel had been damaged by the loose metal parts, in the simulation.The reactor has a water sensor, but it is nine inches off the floor. David Lochbaum, a nuclear engineer at the Union of Concerned Scientists, a group that is often critical of nuclear safety regulation, said that a leak of 150 gallons per minute would take 90 minutes for the sensor to detect.But the emergency director is supposed to categorize the event in the first 15 minutes. Mr. Lochbaum said this raised the question of whether the sensor was in the right place, or should be nearer the floor.Mr. Gasser said that if the sensor was too near the floor, debris that might be present during an accident could affect its operation.The commission pays close attention to how the industry and the public react to nuclear events. Last November, a Tennessee school district sent children home after an instrument at the Watts Bar Nuclear Plant indicated (falsely, as it turned out) there might be a leak. Commission officials said the reaction was unwarranted.For Southern, the impact of the poor rating could be enhanced scrutiny by regulators, which could in turn make Southern’s stock price fall or make it harder for the company to raise money.'"
"'07-04-04,'1','BRUSSELS, April 3 (AP) — Regulators said on Tuesday that the deals that Apple struck with record labels to stock its European iTunes stores might violate competition rules.Apple and the record companies were notified of an investigation into their agreements after regulators built up a “very strong case,” said Jonathan Todd, a European Union spokesman.People can download singles or albums only from the iTunes store in their country of residence — a policy that amounts to unlawful “territorial sales restrictions,” the European Commission said.“Consumers are thus restricted in their choice of where to buy music and consequently what music is available, and at what price,” the commission said in a statement.An Apple spokesman, Steve Dowling, said the company wanted to operate a single store for all of Europe, but music labels and publishers said there were limits to the rights they could grant to Apple.'"
"'07-04-04,'1','María Julia Hernández, a prominent human rights advocate who braved death squads to speak for the victims of the long civil war in El Salvador, died Friday in San Salvador, the capital. She was 68.The cause was a heart attack, said her aides at Tutela Legal, the human rights office of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of San Salvador, where Ms. Hernández was the founding director.She spent nearly 30 years gathering evidence of massacres and individual killings, interviewing survivors, seeing that they stayed alive and compiling a book of the dead. It grew into an encyclopedia of political violence. In a land where the rule of the law was weak, she saw herself as a force for solidarity.She worked in a barely furnished room decorated by a cross and two photographs of Archbishop Óscar Arnulfo Romero, the church leader who was assassinated in 1980 by right-wing forces in El Salvador. He was killed while celebrating Mass, after calling upon the army to stop the shadowy death squads who were attacking real and imagined opponents of the status quo.The killing of the archbishop was among the opening shots of a civil war that lasted until 1992, though its aftershocks continue in El Salvador. It was also a central event in Ms. Hernández’s life, which ended 27 years to the day after the archbishop’s burial.'"
"'07-04-04,'1','“Viktor Yushchenko, as commander in chief of Ukraine’s armed forces, also stressed he would allow no use of force in the country,” the news service said in a statement after the meeting.Mr. Yanukovich said before the meeting that he hoped the president would reverse his order. “We shall do everything to persuade the president of Ukraine to recall his decree,” he said, in remarks carried on Russian state television. “If he does not do it, I think in this case not only parliamentary but also presidential elections will be inevitable.”But Mr. Yushchenko reaffirmed after the meeting that he would not rescind his decree.An eight-month-old power-sharing deal between Mr. Yushchenko and Mr. Yanukovich collapsed Monday when Mr. Yushchenko disbanded Parliament, Mr. Yanukovich’s power base, and called new elections for May 27, less than two months from now.On Tuesday, however, a district court in Kiev suspended that resolution.Germany, which holds the rotating presidency of the European Union, issued a statement on Tuesday calling for Ukrainian politicians to resolve their dispute in compliance with “the Constitution and democratic rules.”In Washington, the State Department spokesman, Sean McCormack, said Ukrainian leaders should “take full responsibility for their supporters’ actions” in any street protests.The turnout in Kiev’s squares and parks on a balmy spring day was modest. Several thousand supporters of Mr. Yanukovich rallied at three sites in the city and erected roughly 100 tents on Independence Square, the focus of the 2004 Orange Revolution. But the crowds were orderly and there was no evidence of a major police presence.Mr. Yushchenko’s news service said Tuesday that disbanding Parliament was justified under Ukrainian law because Mr. Yanukovich had recruited individual deputies to join his coalition, in violation of the Constitution, which says a parliamentary coalition can be formed only among parties.Mr. Yanukovich had been working to win a veto-proof, two-thirds majority of 300 in Parliament, known as the Rada. His supporters argued that the Constitution specified only three circumstances when a president could disband Parliament, none of which applied Monday.The Constitutional Court posted a statement on its Web site saying it would decide within 15 days whether to hear an appeal by Parliament that it rule on the constitutionality of Mr. Yushchenko’s decree dissolving it.Taras Kuzio, a political science professor at George Washington University and a Ukraine specialist, said Mr. Yushchenko controlled the variables that mattered in Ukraine’s young political system — the army, the security service and popular support in the capital, Kiev.“I don’t think there is stomach for a fight with the president,” Mr. Kuzio said of Mr. Yanukovich and his supporters in a telephone interview from Kiev. “The president holds more cards.”'"
"'07-04-04,'1','A new analysis of combined data from two parts of a large federal study of hormone therapy has found that women in their 50s do not appear to have an increased heart attack risk if they take the drugs. But it also found that women in their 60s and 70s who still had hot flashes and night sweats were at increased risk for heart attacks, even if they were not taking hormones. And if these women took hormone therapy, their risk was higher still.“The main indication now for hormone therapy is hot flashes and night sweats,” said Dr. Jacques Rossouw, a researcher for the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute who directed the federal study, the Women’s Health Initiative. “This says that if you are older than 60, you should not take it.”That observation needs additional study to confirm and understand it, Dr. Rossouw said. “It’s quite new and unexpected,” he added. Because this group of older women with menopausal symptoms was not specified before the studies began, the researchers described their analysis as exploratory rather than definitive.The new analysis, which appeared this week in the Journal of the American Medical Association, was designed to answer persistent questions about hormone therapy that arose from the Women’s Health Initiative.Its two studies included 27,347 women ages 50 to 79 who were randomly assigned to receive hormones or not. One study involved women who had not had hysterectomies. They took Prempro, a drug made by Wyeth that combines estrogen and progestins. The other involved women who had had a hysterectomy and who took estrogen alone. Estrogen alone can cause cancer of the uterine lining and should not be used by women with a uterus.'"
"'07-04-04,'1','Bar owners threatened to pull him from office over the first move, and restaurant owners are still grumbling over the others.The mayor’s raucous takeover of the public school system in 2002 led to a culinary bonus for the city’s 1.1 million school children. They now have an executive chef, whole wheat bread, salad bars and little plastic bags of sliced New York state apples. Even before the very public rat infestations and a string of high-profile closings, health inspectors were already making about 15,000 more restaurants visits annually than they did four years ago. In January and February, the health department closed 147 restaurants, double the number for the same two months last year.And the Mayor has now turned his attention to hunger and poverty, working with the City Council to get more people to sign up for food stamps and looking with renewed vigor at how to get healthy food to people who live in neighborhoods with no grocery stores.Perhaps the biggest statement Mayor Bloomberg has made about food policy came in the form of a hire. In January, Benjamin Thomases, 31, a New Yorker who holds an MBA from Columbia University, became the first official charged with coordinating the city’s policies on food.“This is a very important moment for the city,” said City Council Speaker Christine C. Quinn, a Greenmarket regular who has a strong following among New York health and food advocacy groups and who pressed the mayor for the position.Still, people engaged in agricultural reform, anti-hunger workers and even the average food-obsessed New Yorker wonder whether the Mayor is actually leading the city’s current food revolution or merely walking in front of a social change that was well under way before he took office.It’s easy to see a dawning awareness in City Hall that government can help people eat better. But it’s not as easy to find a singular grand vision, or even much of a pattern, behind the intersection of food and city government. The mayor declined an interview with The New York Times on this subject and has never presented an overarching view on food policy.“On food issues they’re very peculiar, this Bloomberg administration,” said Toni Liquori, an educator who has worked on food and public health projects in New York City for more than 20 years, including administering a $2 million Kellogg Foundation grant to improve the eating habits and health of New York City school children.“What ends up happening is that one issue will pierce through and someone will charge with it, like trans fats or school meals,” she said. “But you also have a sense that it’s not like the administration is driving anything full tilt. It’s not as if they have embraced the full connection on food.”Anti-hunger advocates, who have long been skeptical of Mayor Bloomberg’s commitment to the poor, credit the Mayor for taking a more serious interest in food as it relates to poverty this term.“The tools are now all in place to achieve significant progress, but it depends on whether the city decides to use the tools,” said Joel Berg, executive director of the New York City Coalition Against Hunger and former member of the Clinton administration.“It took Nixon to go to China,” he said. “Maybe it’ll take a Republican billionaire to have real progress on hunger and poverty.”In many American cities, agricultural politics are being argued at the bar and alpha moms are organizing to take back school cafeterias. Chefs are making heroes out of cattle ranchers and the obesity crisis has prompted a new look at how and what to feed the poor. In an effort to build a cohesive public policy that brings all those food-related movements together, a handful of cities began forming food policy councils in the late 1990s.The organizations, which are in part designed to advise governments on matters of food, usually include anyone who might have a stake in an urban diet. The councils with the most power are seated in city or state health departments, and might include farmers, food bank managers, school principals, backyard gardeners, grocers, chefs, labor leaders and clergy.Both Berkeley and San Francisco have played with the model, as have Hartford, Conn., Toronto and Portland, Ore. Last week, New York state agricultural officials announced that the state would soon have its first food-policy council.The nearest thing New York city government has now is Mr. Thomases, the food czar, who works deep inside the enormous collection of city departments called Health and Human Services. In an interview, however, he said that his job is not to set policy or offer vision.“I prefer not to think of myself as the food czar,” said Mr. Thomases, who is making $85,000 a year, a figure that some in City Hall say would be higher if the position held more power.Rather, his job is to make some sense of the myriad ways the city feeds people. He will be the glue that helps hold it together, said Linda I. Gibbs, the deputy mayor under whom Mr. Thomases serves. His main mechanism will be an interdepartmental food policy task force, which had its first meeting in February. He has also reached out to groups outside government, including large food manufacturers as well as the New York City Food Systems Network, an informal nexus for people who work in hunger, nutrition, agriculture and other food-related endeavors.And while organizations like food councils and positions like Mr. Thomases’ are a start, no major American city has yet established a Department of Food, in the way New York has a Department of Cultural Affairs or a Department of Environmental Protection. Although Gavin Newsom, the mayor of San Francisco, recently weighed in on the 2007 Farm Bill and many mayors have taken up the anti-obesity cause, no mayor of a large urban city has stood up and become, in essence, the Alice Waters of city food politics.In the Bloomberg administration, Dr. Thomas R. Frieden is as close as it gets. As head of the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, he has done more to change the mayor’s thinking about the government’s role in how we eat than anyone else in the administration.Mayor Bloomberg, who has donated millions to the Johns Hopkins school of public health that bears his name, brought in the antismoking, TB-fighting Dr. Frieden early on. Though he’s been labeled both a zealot and a revolutionary, Dr. Frieden doesn’t see himself as either. And he doesn’t see the changes in how New York eats as part of any larger foodie revolution.The city, he points out, has had a long history of making people healthier by controlling food. In 1918, the Board of Health condemned oyster beds in the East River because they were contaminated with typhoid. Today, typhoid isn’t killing New Yorkers. Heart disease is.“Obesity and diabetes are now the only health problems in the United States getting worse,” Dr. Frieden said. In light of the epidemic, Mayor Bloomberg’s hand in changing New York’s diet “has been relatively restrained,” he said.Dr. Frieden, who has a runner’s body even though he swears he can’t lay off desserts, said it took a little bit of convincing to get the mayor behind the trans fat ban. But in the end, as with the smoking ban, it all came down to one question. The mayor asked, “Are you certain this is going to save lives?”Not all of Dr. Freiden’s efforts to alter New York’s food landscape have been successful.He realizes that a law forcing large restaurant chains to post calorie counts as prominently as menu prices might face a court challenge. And although the department often trots out its Healthy Bodegas Initiative as an example of innovative food policy work, the project has not gotten very far.The idea was to encourage bodegas in neighborhoods with poverty and health problems to sell more nutritious food. An effort to get more 1 percent milk into some stores worked, but an attempt to persuade 60 bodegas in East Harlem and the South Bronx to sell packages of sliced New York apples and carrots didn’t take off.The program began in all 60 in December, but as of last week, no one could say how many bodegas still sold the snacks, and a department spokeswoman called it a preliminary effort that bogged down by distribution problems.Despite those stumbles, many in city government feel empowered under Mayor Bloomberg’s leadership to take on food-related projects. The Department for the Aging is rethinking the Meals on Wheels programs and wondering about how to serve more culturally appropriate meals at senior centers populated by people with, say, roots in China or Italy. The New York City health code was amended last spring so that day-care providers must offer their charges fewer calories. The Department of Housing Preservation and Development will open two 20,000-square-foot urban farms this summer on vacant city land.Ms. Gibbs, a tough and experienced bureaucrat who started with the Giuliani administration, gets a twinkle in her eye when she starts to contemplate the ways food issues might come together in the city.“There’s no doubt in my mind there’s something about food in the air that people are picking up,” she said.On the other hand, chefs are mixed on Mr. Bloomberg’s food record — especially the few who got hit with fines last year for cooking sous vide, which involves vacuum-sealing food in plastic and cooking it slowly in water that’s barely hot. Fearing the practice could infect diners with pathogens like botulism, the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene has restricted its use while it develops regulations.“In the restaurant industry, we see the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene as a division of tax and finance,” said Colin Alevras, the chef and co-owner of the Tasting Room, who doesn’t think Mr. Bloomberg is a serious food guy.Former Mayor Ed Koch, a man who knows a thing or two about the headaches of trying to run New York as well as the pleasures of eating in its restaurants, counters that the mayor really is a food guy.“And he has a great cache of wine,” Mr. Koch said.Although he’s a little disappointed he wasn’t tapped to serve as the city’s official taster, he does have a little piece of advice for Mayor Bloomberg as he works on food policy: Don’t forget that eating is about pleasure, and food is supposed to taste good.“You don’t want to leave food policy to a doctor,” said Mr. Koch. “Because a doctor cuts out everything.”'"
"'07-04-04,'1','The high viewer turnout for “Idol,” which is on tonight, cannot solely be explained by technological advances or a regression in human nature. It cannot be a coincidence that television voting rights arose so soon after the 2000 election left slightly more than half the voting population feeling cheated. Those who didn’t go to the polls and fear that their abstention inadvertently made possible the invasion of Iraq may feel even worse. “Idol” could be a displacement ritual: a psychological release that allows people to vote — and even vote often — in a contest that has no dangerous or even lasting consequences. (Even losers win out in the end: both Mr. Gore and Jennifer Hudson ended up on the Oscar stage.)Maybe the reason that more people didn’t turn out for the 2004 presidential race, despite the closeness of the tally four years earlier, is that they were still in denial and distracted by “American Idol.”In this electoral process, voters have the final word, not Mr. Cowell, Randy Jackson and Paula Abdul. Once the early elimination process is over, the judges’ role is closer to that of panelists in a League of Women Voters presidential debate. They use their prestige and expertise to help viewers discern who is the most gifted and qualified contender, but ultimately, they cannot override popular opinion, even when it turns frivolous and favors Ross Perot or Mr. Malakar.Mr. Cowell told “Extra” that he may leave the show if Mr. Malakar wins. His threat adds to the suspense, but it’s not very sporting. Mr. Cowell made a fortune giving the masses a voice, only to now complain that the voice selected by the masses isn’t good enough. Mr. Malakar, like Mr. Perot or more currently, Mitt Romney, has a dark-horse appeal that cannot be dismissed solely as a fluke engineered by Mr. Stern — or the frisky ponytail mohawk that Mr. Malakar sported last week.“Idol” traffics in the thrill of counter-consensus. Mr. Malakar is the beneficiary of the same impulse that drives fans sitting in a row of a sports arena to rise together to perform a human wave. Sheer perversity seems to have prompted Mr. Stern to champion Mr. Malakar, urging his listeners to heed votefortheworst.com, a blogger lobby group that supports oddball, least-likely-to-succeed singers. That’s not a bad thing either, not even for “Idol,” which is not in any real danger of being ruined, but is instead coasting on a wave of Sanjaya-spurred publicity.“Idol” is not just among the most popular series on television, it’s an institution, and an international one at that. When an Iraqi woman won the Middle Eastern version of the contest, “Star Academy,” her victory briefly united Iraqis, regardless of sect or creed. It’s sobering to learn that after all the Bush administration’s efforts to export American-style democracy to Iraq, the one element of American culture that Iraqis took to heart was a television reality show.As “Idol” grows more stately and respectable, it’s only natural for viewers to chip away at its veneer. Outsiders always have an inside edge. Mr. Malakar, who is of Indian descent and has an atavistic teen-idol sweetness, is the ultimate underdog: he can’t sing or dance very well.Howard Dean lost his chance at the 2004 Democratic nomination by letting loose an unseemly scream. The same could be true for the pet noir of “American Idol.” If not, it doesn’t really matter. That’s the reassuring thing about television democracy.'"
"'07-04-04,'1','More prosaically, each region, each town, has its own distinctive bread, the staff of everyday life enriched with noble ingredients for the holiday. In the Tuscan village where I spend a part of each year it is a humble ciacia (CHA-cha, a contraction of focaccia), a brioche-like dough with chunks of pecorino cheese or pancetta liberally distributed through it. In other parts of Italy it may be a sweet dough with bits of chocolate or candied citrus peel, often with colored hard-boiled eggs embedded in the top.The best-known Italian Easter bread is never, to my knowledge, made at home: la colomba, the dove, an elaborate confection, garnished with egg whites and almonds, in the shape of a bird with its wings spread wide, is in every supermarket, highway rest stop, bakery and fancy pastry shop throughout Italy. (Most Italian neighborhood shops in the United States have imported, commercially made colombe; for a more artisanal variety, look in Italian-style bakeries like Sullivan Street Bakery, 533 West 47th Street, (212) 265-5580.)The dove, of course, confirmed Noah’s covenant with the Lord. It is also the bird of peace for Christians. Or is it perhaps symbolic of Aphrodite, whose lover Adonis also died and was restored to new life? Like so much that has to do with Easter, the answer may well be all of the above.In countless southern Italian towns, sweet fragrances of vanilla, cinnamon and orange blossoms mixed with rich, buttery ricotta drift from kitchen windows open to the spring breezes. Home cooks and chefs simmer peeled wheat in milk, sugar and aromatics, the first step in the lengthy preparations for pastiera di grano, the iconic Easter sweet.Pastiera di grano — literally grain pie — also grew out of an excess of eggs along with ricotta made from the milk of newly freshened ewes. But it harks directly back to propitiatory offerings made in ancient, and not so ancient, times to insure a safe harvest. Traditionally the grano, or wheat, comes from an antique strain of durum wheat that must be peeled, like pearled barley, of an indigestible outer pellicle.Peeled wheat, called grano pestato or grano pellato, and sometimes just grano per pastiera, is often available in Italian specialty shops, like Di Palo Fine Foods, 200 Grand Street (Mott Street), (212) 226-1033. Modern cooks unable to find proper grano can also substitute farro, another durum wheat variety that is also peeled. (A recipe for the pie can be found at nytimes.com/dining.)In Greece and some parts of Italy, women still set bowls of wheat or lentils to sprout in darkness, then bring them into the light, often right into church, on the Thursday before Easter. The symbolism is obvious, but it is less well known that this tradition goes directly back to what in ancient Greece were called gardens of Adonis, bowls of wheat grains sprouted by women who followed the cult of Aphrodite’s dead lover.The sumptuous profusions of Easter lasagnas are like proclamations of abundance after the dearth of the Lenten fast. Called simply pasta al forno, oven-baked pasta, in central Italy, in the south it is known as lasagna ripiena, stuffed lasagna, and in dialect sagne chine (ZAHN-yeh KEE-neh). In my part of eastern Tuscany my neighbors bake their Easter pasta in the outside bread oven, built into the house wall, and the oven’s smoky wood fire lends fragrance and flavor to the dish.Thickly layered with meats and sausages and strewn with tiny meatballs, grated and sliced cheeses, wild spring vegetables (pencil-thin asparagus and hop shoots) and garden-grown ones (artichokes and peas), these sumptuous constructions are like gastronomic fortresses against the restraint of the everyday.Above all, though, Easter in the Mediterranean is unimaginable without lamb at the center of the feast. Often spit-roasted or braised in a wood-fired oven, surrounded by many of those seasonal first fruits, lamb, in a sense, is what Easter is all about, the Agnus Dei, the lamb of God, the sacrificial offering of the first-born in the shepherd’s flock, a practice as old as the first shepherd, Abel, whose offering was more pleasing to the Lord than Cain’s tiresome vegetables.In Greece, kokoretsi, the lamb’s tender innards — liver, heart and kidneys — are threaded on spits and grilled over an open fire, just as Homeric heroes did with sacrificial offerings, and on Easter Eve they are turned into the magnificent soup called mageiritsa that finally breaks the Lenten fast. Flavored with dill or wild fennel greens, thickened with avgolemono, eggs beaten with fresh lemon juice, this is a soup to wake the dead and, alas, quite impossible to prepare in the United States, where there is almost no access to baby lamb, let alone to its innards or to wild fennel greens.But a southern Italian lamb dish made with chunks of lamb shoulder has a similar richness. A fricasse of lamb with cheese and eggs, garnished with fresh peas or fava beans, its sauce thickened with eggs and flavored with lemon, is traditionally made for Easter Monday. Known as Pasquetta, or Little Easter, it’s another example of Italian exuberance, an official national holiday when city families decamp to the countryside to lunch al fresco on leftovers of the Sunday feast, happily extending the celebrations of Easter just a little further into the everyday world.'"
"'07-04-04,'1','Sales of G.P.S. devices are already booming. The global market for the devices hit $15 billion in 2006, according to the GPS Industry Council, a Washington trade group, and is expanding at a rate of 25 to 30 percent annually.But what is also behind the battle for control of navigation technology is a fear that the United States could use its monopoly — the system was developed and is controlled by the military, after all — to switch off signals in a time of crisis.“In a few years, business without a navigation signal will become inconceivable,” said Andrei G. Ionin, an aerospace analyst with the Center for the Analysis of Strategies and Technologies, which is linked to the Russian defense ministry. “Everything that moves will use a navigation signal — airplanes, trains, yachts, people, rockets, valuable animals and favorite pets.”When that happens, countries that choose to rely only on G.P.S., he said, will be falling into “a geopolitical trap” of American dominance of an important Internet-age infrastructure. The United States could theoretically deny navigation signals to countries like Iran and North Korea, not just in time of war, but as a high-tech form of economic sanction that could disrupt power grids, banking systems and other industries, he said. The United States government’s stated policy is to provide uninterrupted signals globally.G.P.S. devices, in fact, are at the center of the dispute over the Iranian seizure of 15 British sailors and marines. The British maintain that the devices on their boats showed they were in Iraqi waters; the Iranians have countered with map coordinates that it said showed they had been in Iranian waters.Russia’s project, of course, carries wide implications for armies around the world by providing a navigation system not controlled by the Pentagon, complementing Moscow’s increasingly assertive foreign policy stance.The United States formally opened G.P.S. to civilian users in 1993 by promising to provide it continually, at no cost, around the world.The Russian system is also calculated to send ripples through the fast-expanding industry for consumer navigation devices by promising a slight technical advantage over G.P.S. alone, analysts and industry executives say. Devices receiving signals from both systems would presumably be more reliable.President Vladimir V. Putin, who speaks often about Glonass and its possibilities, has prodded his scientists to make the product consumer friendly.“The network must be impeccable, better than G.P.S., and cheaper if we want clients to choose Glonass,” Mr. Putin said last month at a Russian government meeting on the system, according to the Interfax news agency.“You know how much I care about Glonass,” Mr. Putin told his ministers.G.P.S. has its roots in the American military in the 1960s. In 1983, before the system was fully functional, President Ronald Reagan suggested making it available to civilian users around the world after a Korean Air flight strayed into Soviet airspace and was shot down.G.P.S. got its first military test in the Persian Gulf war in 1991, and was seen as a big reason for the success of the precision bombing campaign, which helped spur its adoption in commercial applications in the 1990s.The Russian system, like America’s G.P.S., has roots in the cold war technology to guide strategic bombers and missiles. It was briefly operational in the mid-1990s, but fell into disrepair. The Russian satellites send signals that are usable now but work only intermittently.To operate globally, a system needs a minimum of 24 satellites, the number in the G.P.S. constellation, not counting spares in orbit.A receiver must be in line of sight of no fewer than three satellites at any time to triangulate an accurate position. A fourth satellite is needed to calculate altitude. As other countries introduce competing systems, devices capable of receiving foreign signals along with G.P.S. will more often be in line of sight of three or more satellites.Within the United States, Western Europe and Japan, ground-based transmissions hone the accuracy of signals to within a few feet of a location — better than what could be achieved with satellite signals alone. The Russian and eventual European or Chinese systems, therefore, would make receivers more reliable in preventing signal loss when there are obstructions, like steep canyons, tall buildings or even trees.Still, a Glonass-capable G.P.S. receiver in the United States, Western Europe or Japan would not be more accurate than a G.P.S. system alone, because of the ground-based correction signals. In other parts of the world, a Glonass-capable G.P.S. receiver would be more reliable and slightly more accurate.American manufacturers that are dominant in the industry could be confronted with pressure to offer these advantages to customers by making devices compatible with the Russian system, inevitably undermining the American monopoly on navigation signals used in commerce.In this sense, the Russians are setting off the first salvo in a battle for an infrastructure in the skies. Russia sees a great deal at stake in influencing the standards that will be used in civilian consumer devices.The market for satellite navigators is growing rapidly. Garmin, the largest American manufacturer, more than doubled sales of automobile navigators in 2006, for example, and in February it showed a Super Bowl ad that was seen as a coming of age for G.P.S. navigators as a mass market product.Jeremy D. Ludwig was one consumer who said he would be willing to pay a slight premium for a device equipped with a chip capable of processing Russian navigation signals.He recounted a recent trip on Interstate 25 in Colorado, when, he said, he was dismayed to discover the G.P.S. device on his BlackBerry had inexplicably lost its signal, just as he was trying to decide which exit to take into Denver.“If you don’t know which exit to take, you’re already lost,” Mr. Ludwig, an art student, said in a recent telephone interview from Colorado Springs.That kind of attitude is what Russia is banking on even as it also takes a stab at making consumer receivers — so far without much success. But the Russian goal of diversifying navigation signals used in commerce will be achieved, Mr. Ionin said, even if foreign manufacturers simply adopt the Russian standard, and even if Russia’s own attempt to make consumer devices fails.To encourage wide acceptance, Mr. Putin has been pitching the system during foreign visits, asking for collaboration and financial support.Now, only makers of high-end surveying and professional navigation receivers have adopted dual-system capability.Topcon Positioning Systems of Livermore, Calif., for example, offers a Glonass and G.P.S. receiver for surveyors and heavy-equipment operators. Javad Navigation Systems is built around making dual-system receivers, with offices in San Jose and Moscow.Javad Ashjaee, the president of Javad, said in an interview that wide adoption was inevitable because more satellites provided an inherently better service. “If you have G.P.S., you have 90 percent of what you need,” he said. Russia’s system will succeed, he said, “for that extra 10 percent.”Adding Glonass to low-end consumer devices would require a new chip, with associated design costs, but probably not much in the way of additional manufacturing expenses, he said.Already this year, in a sign of growing acceptance of Glonass, another high-end manufacturer, Trimble, based in Sunnyvale, Calif., introduced a Russian-compatible device for agricultural navigators, used for applying pesticides, for example.Whether consumer goods manufacturers will follow is an open question, John R. Bucher, a wireless equipment analyst at BMO Capital Markets, said in a telephone interview.Garmin, which has more than 50 percent of the American market, has not yet taken a position on Glonass. “We are waiting,” Jessica Myers, a spokeswoman for Garmin, said in a telephone interview.For most consumers, she said, devices are reliable enough already. Growth in the industry is driven instead by better digital mapping and software, making what already exists more useful. Garmin’s latest car navigator, for example, alerts drivers to traffic jams on the road ahead and the price of gas at nearby stations.At home at least, the Kremlin is guaranteeing a market by requiring ships, airplanes and trucks carrying hazardous materials to operate with Glonass receivers, while providing grants to half a dozen Russian manufacturers of navigators.Technically precise they may be, but even by Russian standards, some of the Russian-made products coming to market now are noticeably lacking in convenience features.At the Russian Institute of Radionavigation and Time in St. Petersburg, for example, scientists have developed the M-103 dual system receiver. The precision device theoretically operates more reliably than a G.P.S. unit under tough conditions, like the urban canyons of Manhattan.With its boxy appearance, the M-103 resembles a Korean War-era military walkie-talkie. It weighs about one pound and sells for $1,000, display screen not included. To operate, a user must unfurl a cable linking the set to an external antenna mounted on a spiked stick, intended to be jabbed into a field.“Unfortunately, we haven’t developed a hand-held version yet,” said Vadim S. Zholnerov, a deputy director of the institute.'"
"'07-04-04,'1','THE merger boom has created a subplot perfect for a spy thriller: a proliferation of code names that executives and investment bankers use to disguise the parties in a potential deal.Often inspired by Greek gods, sports figures or city names, the code names turn up in early presentations in place of actual company names, which, at least in theory, are supposed to stay secret until an agreement is announced. A common approach is to substitute a word with the same first letter of each company, although deal makers sometimes get more fanciful.Bankers hired last year to seek a possible buyer for Intrawest, which owns ski resorts and golf courses, referred to their mission as Project Wintergames. The connection: Intrawest owns the Whistler ski resort near Vancouver, British Columbia, the site of the 2010 Winter Olympics. (Intrawest agreed to be acquired by Fortress Investment Group, a private equity and hedge fund firm, for about $1.8 billion in August.)Here are some big deals — or near deals — from the recent merger wave as well as earlier ones, and the pseudonyms they inspired. Can you match them?'"
"'07-04-04,'1','If Goldman Sachs is sometimes accused of being a hedge fund masked as an investment bank, Citadel has elements of an investment bank disguised as a hedge fund, minus the investment bankers.Besides trading for itself, Citadel has a stock loan department and has become one of the largest options market makers in the industry.It runs two reinsurance companies and recently disclosed that it would provide administration services to other hedge funds, a lucrative business that is usually offered for hedge funds, and not by them.In December, a Citadel unit raised $500 million in debt, a groundbreaking move for a hedge fund that further enhances its independence from Wall Street.Mr. Griffin has “institutionalized much of his business along the lines of an investment bank,” said Richard S. Fuld Jr., the chairman and chief executive of Lehman Brothers, which does extensive business with Citadel. “He’s certainly involved in some of the same activities that a hedge fund is, but he’s built more than that. He also acts as a broker-dealer and creates liquidity for investors. We have found many good ways to work together.”At 38, Mr. Griffin is straight from hedge fund central casting, with a lanky six-foot frame, steely blue eyes and an affection for Ferraris and modern art. (He recently paid $80 million for Jasper Johns’s “False Start.”) Born in Daytona Beach, Fla., he lived in Texas and Wisconsin as a child, and returned to Boca Raton for middle school and high school. His father was a project manager for General Electric.His wife is Anne Dias, a multilingual Harvard Business School graduate who runs Aragon Global Management, a smaller, value- focused hedge fund. Their wedding took place in the gardens of Versailles. The couple recently donated $19 million to the Art Institute of Chicago, where part of the Renzo Piano-designed addition will be named the Kenneth and Anne Griffin Court.Mr. Griffin has said that he and his wife enjoyed one of their first dates at the museum. “For us, our relationship with this great, encyclopedic museum can be described as ‘love at first sight,’ ” he said.Art and love aside, Mr. Griffin has not made his fortune with charm and grace. Interviews with more than a dozen people who have invested with or worked beside or for Mr. Griffin paint a similar picture: arrogant, unapologetic and extremely smart.“Is Ken the nicest boss in the world?” asked Mark W. Yusko, a former chief investment officer at the University of North Carolina’s endowment fund, and now the president of Morgan Creek Capital Management, an investment advisory firm. “He won’t win that award. But he’s a great guy to work for because if you buy into the philosophy and the process and the system, you will be part of a great organization.”Like most great investors, Mr. Griffin seeks disruptions in normal patterns to make money. When Enron collapsed, he sent a team around the country to interview hundreds of energy traders, meteorologists and quantitative researchers. He hired seven to start an energy trading business.When Amaranth, the $9.5 billion hedge fund, blew up on bad natural-gas bets last summer, Citadel teamed up with J. P. Morgan to buy the book of energy trades. Citadel made a killing on the transaction, investors say. Now, as the market for subprime mortgages has imploded, Citadel has been on a shopping spree, acquiring assets and a portfolio of loans from ResMae, a bankrupt mortgage originator; and bought a 4.5 percent stake in Accredited Home Lenders, a troubled mortgage company.“When everyone is running away, he is adjusting his portfolio and buying more,” said Mr. Yusko, a longtime investor.Mr. Griffin declined to comment for this article.His beginnings are the stuff of hedge fund legend. Mr. Griffin started trading options as a Harvard freshman. To get price feeds, he had a satellite dish installed on the side of Cabot House dormitory.While it is widely thought that Mr. Griffin did not graduate from Harvard, he in fact did, a year early with an economics degree.Frank Meyer, then the head of Glenwood Investment Corporation, an alternative investment group in Chicago, met Mr. Griffin, was impressed and gave him $1 million to trade. Mr. Griffin, just old enough to drink legally, produced returns of 70 percent trading convertible bonds. In November 1990, he opened Citadel with $4.6 million. After three blowout years, the convertible bond market crashed, his returns cratered and investors pulled out a lot of their money. At an unusually young age, Mr. Griffin learned an important lesson: Liquidity — access to money to be able to make trades — is critical, and in times of distress, is often unavailable.During the 1990s, Mr. Griffin instituted strict lockups, meaning that his investors had to trust him with their money for longer periods. The last lockups were put in place less than a month before Long-Term Capital Management melted down in 1998, causing the Federal Reserve to organize a Wall Street bailout of the hedge fund. That year, the other Citadel flagship fund, Citadel Wellington, had a return of more than 30 percent, partly because Mr. Griffin had the capital to play in a confused market.After the financial crises of 1998, Mr. Griffin accelerated a process already under way: cutting Wall Street out at every possible turn. That meant securing sources of money through lockups, thinking about how to tap the public markets and starting businesses like stock lending.Mr. Griffin’s funds grew as he posted big-number returns: Citadel Wellington had a gain of more than 45 percent in 1999 and about 53 percent in 2000.By 2006, reflecting both the explosive growth of hedge funds over all as well as its own mediocre returns in 2005, Citadel was the 11th-largest fund with $12 billion. Forbes listed Mr. Griffin as the 204th-richest American in 2006, with $1.7 billion.Success has not come without blips. Rush Simonson, a mentor and friend, sued Mr. Griffin in 2006, accusing him of stealing a business plan the two had put together. He later dropped his suit. Mr. Simonson’s lawyer, Edward A. Wallace, declined to comment. Citadel helped finance a group of investors, including the Republican lobbyist Jack Abramoff, in the purchase of SunCruz Casinos, a fleet of gambling boats.Mr. Griffin has not been involved in the day-to-day trading for years; instead, he manages the more than 1,000 employees of Citadel. But he does get involved with decisions in each of the firm’s seven businesses. For example, in 2005, when the convertible arbitrage world was tanking, he came down to the desk and took over.As assets continue to flood the industry, and as Citadel continues to grow, returns will be harder to come by. Mr. Griffin conceded that point in a 2005 interview with the Harvard College Investment Magazine.“I don’t think any industry has attracted as much capital over such a short period of time throughout history,” he told the magazine. “With that much capital flowing into the business, it is reasonable to conclude that the prospect for better than market returns going forward is bleak.”Of course, he aims to be the exception.“He’s just as intense today as he was 20 years ago,” said Mr. O’Connor, now a managing director at Merrill Lynch. “He still wants to be the best.”'"
"'07-04-04,'1','In his biggest coup so far, Mr. Lasdon signed a contract last month to sell the office condo that Urban Justice Center has occupied for a decade — 7,700 square feet at 666 Broadway, at the corner of Bond Street — to a fashion company, Fraxy, for $5.7 million, or nearly 10 times what he paid for it in 1997.This week, his group will move into 20,000 square feet of newly renovated space at 123 William Street at the below-market annual rent of $27 a square foot.An unlikely wheeler-dealer, Mr. Lasdon does not own a cellphone or home computer, much less a BlackBerry.He paid no rent at all when he moved into his first office in 1984, in a burned-out building in East Harlem. “For five years, they renovated around me,” he said. For the next decade, he gradually traded up, moving to the area around the then drug-infested Tompkins Square Park and then to the Flatiron district.In 1996, when his lease was about to expire and comparable space was renting for about $18 a square foot, a broker offered him the opportunity to buy the 10th floor at 666 Broadway in NoHo for $700,000. Mr. Lasdon said he realized that if he could pare the price to $600,000, his annual mortgage and maintenance costs would total only $11 a square foot.At the time, few businesses, nonprofit or otherwise, were buying their own space. “I asked myself, ‘What is the reason I shouldn’t do this?’ ” Mr. Lasdon said. “I couldn’t find one.”Arnold B. Peinado III, a board member and partner at the law firm of Milbank, Tweed, Hadley & McCoy, said the directors weighed the question carefully. “The organization’s mission is not to be in the real estate business, but instead to serve its clients,” he said. “It seemed at the time to be a bit daring, but probably economical, to go ahead and take a chance on buying a floor.”The seller had agreed informally on the $600,000 price but later tried to raise it, Mr. Lasdon recalled. “We had a handshake deal,” he said. “I said, ‘I’m not going to do it, as a matter of principle.’ ” A week later, he got the price he wanted. The down payment was $100,000.“It was the deal of the century,” said the broker who handled the purchase, David N. Lebenstein, now the director of the nonprofit division at Colliers ABR. “We hit the timing right. But even then, he was trying to cut the price down.”As the Urban Justice Center grew — it now employs 62 people and has an annual budget of $4.5 million — it rented additional space in the same building. But last year, when additional space there was not available, Mr. Lasdon decided it was time to move. Twice he came close to buying space in Lower Manhattan — in one case, the seller changed its mind after agreeing to a sale. “Nothing’s a deal until it’s signed” was the lesson that Mr. Lasdon said he drew.A couple of other disappointments followed, eventually leading him to conclude that condo space was out of reach.Nonprofit organizations that find themselves occupying valuable real estate often face similar obstacles, Mr. Lebenstein said. “The problem is, where do they go?” he said. Clients need to find new quarters, as Mr. Lasdon did, before giving up the space they have, he said.In October, Mr. Lasdon agreed to a lease at 123 William Street after getting the landlord to reduce the rent and his new broker, Mark Mandell, a senior director at Cushman & Wakefield, to cut his commission.Initially, Mr. Lasdon planned to rent out the office at 666 Broadway, but he found no takers. “It was a bit of a mess,” Mr. Mandell recalled. “It didn’t show as well as it might have if it were vacated, or even demolished.”Then, in the fall, the fashion company, Fraxy, offered to buy the space for $5 million. “I said, ‘If they’re willing to pay $5 million, let’s see how high they’re going to go.’ ” But as the price began to rise, Mr. Lasdon said, “I started to get nervous. I was going to outsmart myself.” Mr. Lasdon also negotiated with another potential buyer.Ultimately, Mr. Lasdon was able to drive up the price to $5.7 million. He also got Mr. Mandell to reduce his commission by one-third. (Mr. Mandell would not discuss the commissions he received.)Mr. Lasdon said he would have to set aside $200,000 a year in income from this windfall to cover the increase in rent, but will have plenty left over for programs.And maybe some real estate. He said he would like to develop a building for the sole use of nonprofit organizations.The real estate world can be “frustrating and maddening,” he said. “But if it works out, it’s terrific.”'"

"'07-04-05,'1','MIAMI, April 5 — Gov. Charlie Crist persuaded Florida’s clemency board today to let most felons easily regain their voting rights after prison, saying it was time to “leave the offensive ranks” of states that uniformly deny ex-offenders such rights.The change is a major step for Florida, which bans more people from the polls than any other state, but it is not as drastic as Mr. Crist had hoped. Two of his fellow Republicans on the clemency board rejected his original plan to grant speedy restoration to everyone except murderers and sex criminals.Florida has as many as 950,000 disenfranchised ex-offenders, far more than any other state, of whom the vast majority are black. Other states have repealed or scaled back similar bans in recent years, but roughly five million former felons remain barred from the polls nationwide.Until now in Florida, most felons who finished prison and probation time had to submit to a lengthy review and waiting period if they wanted their civil rights back. But under the new rules passed today, the roughly 80 percent of ex-offenders whose crimes were not violent will win automatic rights restoration as long as they have paid any restitution owed to victims and have no pending criminal charges.Convicted murderers, sexual predators and “violent career criminals” will still need a thorough investigation of their case and hearing before the clemency board, and they are not likely to win back their right to vote, serve on a jury and get jobs that require state licenses.“This is holy week, a week that is all about forgiveness,” Mr. Crist said before the vote at a special meeting of the clemency board in Tallahassee. “Restoring civil rights is the right thing to do.”'"
"'07-04-05,'1','If it weren’t for IGF-1, Paris Hilton’s life would be a lot less elegant.She’d be lugging around an Irish wolfhound in her purse.Scientists have just discovered which gene fragment controls the size of dogs, which have the greatest size range of any mammal — no other species produces adults with 100-fold differences, like that between a two-pound chihuahua and a 200-pound Newfoundland.In a study to be published tomorrow in the journal Science, researchers analyzed 3,241 purebred dogs from 143 breeds. Genetically, the yapper arguing with your ankle is almost identical to the drooling behemoth bred to hunt bears, except for a tiny bit of DNA that suppresses the “insulin-like growth factor 1” gene.Dog breeders have unwittingly been selecting for it since the last Ice Age. Dogs emerged from the wolf about 15,000 years ago, and as far back as 10,000 years ago, domesticated dogs as big as mastiffs and as small as Jack Russell terriers were trotting the earth.The study’s lead author, Elaine A. Ostrander, chief of cancer genetics at the National Human Genome Research Institute, said she visited a lot of dog shows, asking for blood.“It became kind of a status symbol to participate, and we were inundated,” she said. “I only wanted one sample from any descendant of one grandfather, and owners would show up with five Scottish deerhounds, all of them siblings, and say ‘oh, absolutely, they all want to be in.’”'"
"'07-04-05,'1','The officials said that Mr. Charlow sold additional shares — perhaps the result of exercising the 2,500 options — in 2005, and that he earned a total of more than $100,000 from all the sales. Student Loan Xpress was put on Columbia’s preferred lending list in 2005.Mr. Charlow, who the officials said sat on Student Loan Xpress’s advisory board, did not return a call.Officials at the university notified Mr. Cuomo of Mr. Charlow’s investments. The attorney general has now subpoenaed Columbia for documents describing its relations with loan companies.Mr. Cuomo also sent subpoenas to Student Loan Xpress and its current parent company, CIT Group, seeking documents and testimony. And he wrote to the universities in Texas and California seeking more information.Student Loan Xpress was acquired by CIT in 2005. C. Curtis Ritter, a spokesman for CIT, said the transactions at issue “occurred several years prior to CIT’s acquisition of the company.”“We are currently seeking to determine the facts surrounding those transactions,” Mr. Ritter said in an e-mail message.Student Loan Xpress accounts for nearly 39 percent of the federal loan volume to undergraduates at Columbia, according to Student Marketmeasure, a research firm that focuses on the student loan industry.Student Loan Xpress has also featured praise from Mr. Charlow on its Web site. “We have worked with the Student Loan Xpress team for many years because they consistently meet the very high standards for service that our students and parents expect not only from our university, but also from our partners,” he was quoted as saying.The revelations that financial aid administrators had investments in a student loan company come as state and federal lawmakers have stepped up their scrutiny of incentives that loan companies offer to curry favor with universities as tuitions — and student debt — rise. Last year, according to the College Board, students took out $85 billion in loans. Students rarely comparison shop and often rely on the preferred lenders list recommended by universities to take out a loan. Sometimes, only a handful of companies make the list.“There’s an implicit assumption that the financial aid office is an impartial, informed intermediary,” said Michael Dannenberg, director of education policy at the New America Foundation, a public policy institute in Washington. “What we’re finding out now is that some colleges and some financial aid administrators may not be so impartial.”The 2003 government filings show that Lawrence W. Burt, associate vice president and director of student financial aid at the University of Texas, and Catherine Thomas, associate dean of admission and director of financial aid at the University of Southern California, also had investments in the Education Lending Group.Mr. Burt said yesterday that he had been invited to invest in the student loan company in 2001 at about $1 a share. Records show he sold 1,500 shares at about $10 a share two years later and held 500 options on additional shares.Ms. Thomas also sold 1,500 shares and held 500 options. She did not return a call yesterday, and it was not clear whether she had initially bought stock at the same price as Mr. Burt and Mr. Charlow.Mr. Burt said the University of Texas had not known that he owned stock in Student Loan Xpress. He said that Student Loan Xpress became a preferred lender at the university in the 2002-3 school year and that his ownership of stock in the company did not influence his decision about whether to place it on the list. He said he no longer held any stock in Student Loan Xpress.Mr. Burt said the university received no financial benefit from putting Student Loan Xpress on its lender list. “We do not direct students to specifically choose one lender over another,” he said. “All the lenders on our lender list are only on our lender list because they provide good service and good borrower benefits.”Juan C. Gonzalez, vice president for student affairs at the University of Texas, said in an e-mail message that the university would review how preferred lenders were selected. “In addition, we will review if any individual at the university has any perceived or real ‘conflict of interest’ in this selection process,” he said.Under the rules of the University of Texas System, a state employee “may not have a direct or indirect interest, including financial and other interests, or engage in a business transaction or professional activity, or incur any obligation of any nature that is in substantial conflict with the proper discharge of the officer’s or employee’s duties in the public interest.”James Grant, a spokesman for the University of Southern California, said the institution had “received the letter today from the attorney general, and will now review the information in the letter and respond.” It is not clear when Student Xpress became a preferred lender there.The National Association of Student Financial Aid Administrators said in a statement yesterday that it “believes it would be inappropriate for a school to place a lender on a preferred lender list in exchange for shares of stock.” The group added, “We would also note that if the financial aid administrator purchased the stock with their own funds, their ownership of the shares may not be evidence of improper conduct, but would certainly present the appearance of a conflict of interest.”The disclosures that university financial aid officers had a financial stake in a loan company came a few days after five other universities agreed in a settlement with Mr. Cuomo to pay back $3.2 million to students to resolve an investigation of arrangements in which the institutions were paid by lenders based on student loan volume. Citibank also agreed to pay $2 million to a fund to educate students and parents about student loans. The institutions all said they had done nothing wrong.In Washington, the Education Department is considering whether to regulate preferred lending lists. Senator Edward M. Kennedy, the Massachusetts Democrat who is chairman of the committee on education, has requested information from lenders on their ties to universities, as has his counterpart in the House, Representative George Miller, Democrat of California.At least one other state attorney general, Lori Swanson of Minnesota, has begun to look into such relationships as well.'"

"'07-04-05,'1','Few parents are openly criticizing the goal of diversity, but a group calling itself Concerned Citizens of Greenwich has run full-page advertisements in local newspapers offering a critique of the task force. Dr. Sternberg said she had received a flood of e-mail messages, including many that took a “hateful, bullying tone.” In a recent essay in Greenwich Time, she cited one e-mail message from a parent who complained: “The children are exposed to racial diversity in middle school and high school and in their extracurricular activities. ... We don’t want our elementary school-age children used to neutralize the makeup of another part of town.”Though Greenwich’s population of 61,000 is 90 percent white, according to the census, nearly a quarter of the public school system’s 8,800 students are black, Hispanic or Asian. Yet their representation in many elementary and middle schools is lopsided.At the Old Greenwich School, in a neighborhood on the east side of town near Stamford where modest fixer-uppers can fetch $1 million, school officials say the student body is roughly 95 percent white. On the west side of town near Port Chester, N.Y., an increasingly Hispanic area where there is a large housing project, the Hamilton Avenue School is 59 percent minority and the New Lebanon School is 53 percent minority, according to district officials; both are in violation of state law by being more than 25 percentage points off the district average in terms of racial mix. (Old Greenwich, meanwhile, is likely to be found in “impending” violation for deviating from the state average by at least 15 points.)About 2,900 Greenwich children, most of them white, attend private schools.The state law mandates that a district must develop a plan to diversify any school more than 25 points off the district’s average. Greenwich has committed to spend $29 million on a new building for Hamilton Avenue and has made it a magnet school in hopes of attracting white students from throughout the district.But Dr. Sternberg said such efforts — along with past attempts to improve the heavily minority schools by reducing class sizes — did little to address the looming issue of racial isolation in a district where test scores show a significant gap between racial groups. In both elementary and middle schools, the proportion of white students meeting state goals in reading is 40 percentage points higher than the proportion of black students and 25 points higher than Hispanics; the gaps in math are even larger.“It’s laudable to put in resources, but where it fell short was it allowed the perpetuation of a separate but equal system, which the Supreme Court said is not O.K.,” Dr. Sternberg said in an interview. “Strong academic achievement is necessary for success but not sufficient, if kids can’t really interact with each other.”Gary Orfield, a professor of education at the University of California, Los Angeles, who is among the nation’s leading experts on school desegregation, criticized Connecticut’s law as weak, saying its watch list was “more like a warning system than a true enforcement process.” As in many other states, he said, the law does nothing to combat the larger disparities in diversity from one town to the next. “In every region of the country we have segregation spreading, and most places aren’t doing anything about it,” he said.Connecticut’s attempts to make public schools reflect their communities at large goes back to about 1969, according to Karen Flanagan, a lawyer at the Department of Education who monitors schools for compliance. But even if it were strictly enforced, the law allows for many racially homogeneous schools: As long as Greenwich’s minority enrollment stays below 25 percent, for example, schools could be all white without breaking the law.Likewise, Dr. Sternberg noted, towns with few minority residents like Darien, Avon and New Canaan could operate schools that are all white, while heavily black and Hispanic cities like New Haven and Bridgeport could have schools that are overwhelmingly minority without tripping over the state thresholds.“If you live in Darien, none of this applies to you,” Dr. Sternberg said. “It will never apply to them.”Besides Greenwich, the only other district Connecticut found in violation of the law last year was West Hartford, an affluent town also on the problem list since 2000. West Hartford administrators successfully argued seven years ago that two of their schools, now magnets, were “unique,” a designation that exempts them from having to file yearly action plans. But racial stratification in West Hartford’s 11 elementary schools has worsened, and the district is expecting another sharp letter this week reminding it that two of its schools have too high a concentration of minority students and three are close to having too few.“The only real quick fix is a major redistricting of our entire elementary school system, and our board has said that’s contrary to the philosophy of the neighborhood schools,” said David P. Sklarz, West Hartford’s superintendent. “People move from other parts of Connecticut to West Hartford because they like the idea that their children can go to the neighborhood schools. There are sidewalks, crossing guards. It’s a bit like going back in time.”Besides Greenwich and West Hartford, Fairfield and Groton each have a school that is expected to land them on this year’s list of racially imbalanced schools. An additional 12 districts are in line to receive letters warning that schools they run are in impending danger of violating the law. They are: Manchester, Middletown, Norwich, Norwalk, Waterbury, Enfield, Shelton, Vernon, Danbury, Wallingford and two newcomers, Glastonbury and Hartford.Districts that show no progress can theoretically lose state funding under the law, though neither Ms. Flanagan nor Dr. Sternberg, the former state commissioner, could recall this ever happening.Here in Greenwich, Dr. Sternberg has brought new urgency to the discussion, though she has promised no major changes until the task force issues recommendations in September. In the meantime, anxious parents have been turning out in droves for several public hearings.At the New Lebanon School, where the minority enrollment has more than doubled in the past decade, Gene Nyitray, the principal, acknowledged that his students’ test scores needed improvement, but said parents liked that the school did not need buses and that Spanish was common in the hallways. A majority of parents, he said, “don’t view racial imbalance as a driving force. It’s driven by the state.” If change comes, he said, he hopes to preserve “not just the feel, but the fact, that this is truly a neighborhood school.”At Hamilton Avenue, where nearly 40 percent of the students come from a home where English is not the dominant language and almost a third qualify for free or reduced-price lunches, the principal, Damaris Rau, said she felt the pinch whenever she saw the extras provided by deep-pocketed parent associations at other schools. “It’s also having parents knowing how to advocate for their schools,” Dr. Rau explained. “That doesn’t happen on this side of town.”Hamilton Avenue has been struggling for the past two years without a gymnasium; on recent days, students were practicing juggling and spinning plates as part of an alternative program called “circus arts.” But when its maze of modular buildings is replaced with the $29 million new school this fall, Hamilton Avenue students will have a television studio and free violin lessons in younger grades. Classes have been limited to 15 students, down from 20, and Dr. Rau said she had 153 applications for next year from youngsters outside the neighborhood.'"
"'07-04-05,'1','RIO DE JANEIRO, April 4 — Latin American human rights groups have reacted with satisfaction and muted surprise to the arrest in the United States of three Argentine and Peruvian former military officers accused of human rights abuses who had fled their home countries to avoid prosecution there.Of the three men detained over the weekend in Virginia, Maryland and Florida and charged with violating immigration laws, the most notorious is Ernesto Guillermo Barreiro of Argentina. During the so-called Dirty War of the late 1970s, he was the chief interrogator at La Perla, a clandestine prison in Córdoba, Argentina’s second largest city, where more than 2,000 prisoners were tortured or killed.“This is big news, and deserves to be celebrated both in Argentina and the United States,” said Gastón Chillier, director of the Center for Legal and Social Studies, a leading human rights group in Buenos Aires. “This is someone with a long record not just of crimes against humanity, but also of resistance to efforts to hold him responsible for his actions.”During the 1980s, the democratic civilian government that came to power in Argentina tried to bring Mr. Barreiro to justice. But he defied a court summons to face charges and then quickly helped start a military rebellion that led to passage of an amnesty law that exempted officers below the rank of colonel — he was then a major — from prosecution in connection with human rights abuses on the grounds they were merely following orders.In 2004, a year after Argentina’s current president, Néstor Kirchner, came to power promising to revive such prosecutions, Mr. Barreiro fled to the Washington, D.C., area and opened an antiques store. The Argentine Supreme Court overturned the amnesty nearly two years ago, and several hundred people now face charges, including Mr. Barreiro and María Estela de Perón, the former president, who lives in exile in Spain and is fighting extradition.'"
"'07-04-05,'1','Apparently, the Devils players were not the only ones stunned Monday when General Manager Lou Lamoriello fired Coach Claude Julien and then took over with the team in first place in the Atlantic Division and three games left in the regular season.“You don’t ever come into work expecting to lose your job,” Julien said in a conference call Wednesday after two days of silence.Instead, Lamoriello, who coached the Devils to a shootout victory Tuesday against Ottawa, will coach in the playoffs. Less than 14 months after he was fired as the coach of the Montreal Canadiens and less than 10 months after Lamoriello hired him, Julien, 46, is mulling his future, again. He remains with the organization, for now.“Last year was the first time in my whole coaching career I was let go, and I’d been coaching 13 years,” Julien said, “and, in my mind, I was hoping to go through another 13 years before I’d go through that again. Certainly, it is disappointing.”Lamoriello said Monday that he had not made a snap decision. Lamoriello said the Devils, despite amassing 102 points under Julien, did not appear to be focused for a lengthy playoff run.'"
"'07-04-05,'1','WASHINGTON, April 4 (Bloomberg News) — The top United States intelligence official said Wednesday that his position lacked the authority needed to run the country’s 16 intelligence agencies.The official, Mike McConnell, director of national intelligence, said he was responsible for developing agencies’ budgets and ensuring that intelligence employees did not break the law. But many of the agencies are under the control of the Defense and Justice Departments, he said, and the intelligence director has no power to get rid of poorly performing people.“You cannot hire or fire,” Mr. McConnell told 200 government employees and contractors at the Excellence in Government Conference in Washington. “It puts you in a challenging management position.”The view he expressed differs from previous statements by members of his staff, who have said the position comes with enough authority to make necessary changes to intelligence operations. The job Mr. McConnell now holds was created in a restructuring after intelligence agencies failed to detect and thwart the Sept. 11 terrorist plots and underestimated sectarian violence in postwar Iraq.Mr. McConnell, who replaced John D. Negroponte as director seven weeks ago, said he was working on a plan to bring his job’s power in line with its responsibilities. He also said he wanted to shorten the time it took to get security clearances from a year to a matter of weeks, using processes developed in the financial services industry.'"
"'07-04-05,'1','In 2005, The Times found, the state reported in various accounts that it had contributed three different amounts into the state pension fund for teachers. The actual figure was one of those amounts: zero.Mr. Corzine said on Wednesday that state officials had recently reviewed an audit that found the fund had a deficit of about $25 billion. But some experts have estimated that the shortfall is much larger than that.Whatever the figure is, the governor said, the shortfall must be closed.“The fact is we have a huge hole,” said Mr. Corzine, who has warned of problems with the pension system since taking office 15 months ago. “It has been created by a failure to deal with the issue, frankly, for the better part of a decade, and I consider it one of our greatest challenges.”Aside from the financial questions, Mr. Corzine acknowledged that the state was also reviewing the legal issues surrounding the diversion of money and the inaccurate reporting of contributions. Those practices could run afoul of pension management rules set forth by the Internal Revenue Service and the financial reporting rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission.Federal power to regulate state pension management is limited, however. Donald J. Segal, chairman of the American Academy of Actuaries’ pension practice council, said yesterday that the group had put state pension funding onto the agenda for its next meeting after reading that New Jersey had repeatedly failed to finance its pension plan as required by state statute.Mr. Segal said that he did not think New Jersey was the only place where such things had happened, and that the council wanted to discuss what could be done, in the absence of federal pension rules. One possibility, he said, would be to change professional standards, so that actuaries working for governments would be required to speak out if a government was failing to make its required pension contributions. At the moment, governmental actuaries cannot do so without breaking confidentiality agreements or risking dismissal.Officials with the state’s Department of the Treasury have said that they have done nothing illegal.Mr. Corzine said that regardless of what legal issues arise — or penalties the state might face — New Jersey must find new ways to fill the pension deficit.“Whatever the outcome ultimately of someone reviewing this under federal I.R.S. regulations, we have a responsibility to close that gap,” he said. “We’re trying to take steps on that.”The question of the solvency of state’s pension fund is a result of years of questionable practices by Republican and Democratic legislators and former governors.State Senator Leonard Lance, the Republican minority leader from Hunterdon County who is a longtime advocate of greater transparency in the government’s financial dealings, called for “an immediate and public accounting.”Mr. Lance called on the state treasurer, Bradley I. Abelow, and the head of the Division of Pensions and Benefits, Frederick J. Beaver, to appear before the Senate Budget and Appropriations Committee.“I am deeply disturbed, but not surprised, by media reports that have revealed the scope of the present deficit and potential long-term insolvency of the state’s pension fund,” Mr. Lance said.The Senate president, Richard J. Codey, who was Mr. Corzine’s predecessor as interim governor for 18 months, noted that the state contributed more to the fund in 2006 — about $1.1 billion — than at any other time in recent years. That amount still fell short, however, of the required contributions for that year, $2.2 billion. Of that amount, $1.6 billion was to have been contributed by the state and the rest by local governments.Mr. Codey said he was confident that Mr. Corzine would begin to put the state’s pension system back on track.“We’re no different than a whole host of states that are out there,” said Mr. Codey, a Democrat from Essex County. “When I was governor we used to say a weekly novena that the stock market would go up” — and increase the fund’s value — “but I don’t think any retiree has to worry.

"'07-04-05,'1','The conflict has led to a legal standoff and a new effort by legislators to resolve the issue. It has also inspired an unlikely alliance between the gun lobby, which has long drawn support from the political right, and civil liberties advocates, long identified with the left, in defense of pistol-packing travelers.In a report issued in February, the Texas affiliate of the National Rifle Association joined the American Civil Liberties Union of Texas and the Texas Criminal Justice Coalition “to spotlight unlawful, unnecessary governmental encroachment on average law-abiding citizens.”The report, “Above the Law: How Texas prosecutors are placing their own judgment over that of the Legislature and the law of the land,” found that district and county attorneys had instructed police officers to “unnecessarily” interrogate drivers and arrest them or take their weapons, “even if they are legally carrying the gun.”“It’s all the self-interest of the job,” said Scott Henson, a civil liberties advocate and blogger who wrote the report. Mr. Henson contends that police officers are opposed to citizens’ carrying guns and that prosecutors depend on gun charges to strengthen weak cases and prompt plea bargains.Like many other states, Texas bans the carrying of concealed handguns without a license. Obtaining a license requires a background check and a gun-safety course. By long-established law, however, Texans can cite “traveling” as a defense to possession of an unlicensed handgun. But while traveling was widely understood to denote a journey of some distance, it was never defined. (Travel on planes and other interstate conveyances banning weapons falls under federal jurisdiction.)In 1997, the State Legislature tried to clarify the law by removing unlicensed carrying of a weapon as an offense while traveling. But it left unresolved whether traveling required making an overnight stop, crossing county lines or other conditions.In 2005, lawmakers sought to remove the ambiguity by declaring that anyone in a private vehicle who was not engaged in criminal activity or otherwise barred from possessing a firearm was “presumed to be traveling,” and thus exempt from restrictions on concealed handguns.Terry Keel, a former member of the Texas House of Representatives who sponsored the bill, explained its intent in a statement entered into the record: “In plain terms, a law-abiding person should not fear arrest if they are transporting a concealed pistol in a motor vehicle.”But the measure hardly ended the controversy.Almost as soon as it became law in September 2005, the Texas District and County Attorneys Association signaled its displeasure by advising members that the act did not rule out arrests of otherwise law-abiding drivers carrying weapons. The association said it was up to the courts to determine whether a person was, in fact, traveling. “Therefore,” it declared, “officers are still acting within their lawful discretion if they arrest a person who might qualify for the traveling defense or the new traveling presumption.”Or, as Charles A. Rosenthal Jr., the district attorney of Harris County, which includes Houston, argued, “The presumption of innocence does not make the person innocent.”Now, critics of the district attorneys are backing legislation that would sidestep such issues. A bill before the Texas House would treat personal vehicles like homes, where people are entitled to keep handguns without a license. It would create an exception to the handgun ban for anyone “inside of or directly en route to a motor vehicle” owned by the person or under his control.Will Harrell, the executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Texas, said that even before the current dispute, his group and the N.R.A. had been collaborating on racial profiling issues, particularly on what he called a “Bubba profile” that made certain white men the focus of gun checks by the police.Consequently, Mr. Harrell said, the A.C.L.U. of Texas, the Texas State Rifle Association and the Criminal Justice Coalition filed public information requests with more than 300 district and county attorneys for any advisories on the vehicle handgun law given to local law enforcement officers. Many did not respond or said they had no guidelines, but 13 acknowledged instructions to continue arresting drivers with unlicensed guns or to take their weapons.Mr. Harrell said the collaboration with the Texas State Rifle Association came easy. “I find working with strange bedfellows more comfortable than with those we most often agree with,” he said. And, he said, “the police don’t know what to think of it.”Alice Tripp, the legislative director for the rifle association, conceded that the groups had been seen as an odd couple. “Everybody kind of went, ‘Oh my God, what’s the A.C.L.U. doing here with the gun people?’ ” Ms. Tripp said. But she said they had found common ground on self-defense as an endangered liberty.Mr. Rosenthal, widely regarded as Texas’ most influential district attorney, said a police officer was right to continue inquiring into the travel particulars of an armed driver without a concealed handgun permit. “The presumption is he may be traveling,” he said. “Whether he is is a jury question.”Tim Curry, the criminal district attorney in Tarrant County, which includes Fort Worth, concurred, according to the report, which quoted him as advising the police, “A trip to the grocery store with plans to return home does not constitute traveling.”Mr. Keel disagreed. “It’s no longer an issue of how far you’re going,” he said. “The Legislature ended that debate.”That view was small comfort to Mr. Patton, who won dismissal of his charges but spent a night in jail and was out not only his $300 pistol but also $1,500 to his lawyer, Samuel Cammack III, and $268 for the towing and impoundment fee for his Ford Explorer.Almost worse was the mortification. “Everyone thinks this is the Wild West,” Mr. Patton said. “My dad was incredulous. He said, ‘I thought you lived in Texas.’ ”'"
"'07-04-05,'1','The federal Citizenship and Immigration Services reached its 2008 limit for skilled-worker visa petitions in a single day and says it will not accept any more, to the dismay of technology companies that rely on the visas to hire foreign employees.The agency began accepting petitions Monday for the fiscal year starting Oct. 1 and said it received about 150,000 applications by midafternoon.The temporary H-1B visas are for foreign workers with high-technology skills or in specialty occupations. Congress has mandated that the immigration agency limit the visas granted to 65,000, although the cap does not apply to petitions made on behalf of current H-1B holders, and an additional 20,000 visas can be granted to applicants who hold advanced degrees from American academic institutions.The agency said it would use computers to pick visa recipients randomly from the applications received Monday and Tuesday. It will reject the rest of the applications and return the filing fees.Employers seek H-1B visas on behalf of scientists, engineers, computer programmers and other workers with theoretical or technical expertise. About one-third of Microsoft’s 46,000 employees in the United States have work visas or are legal permanent residents with green cards, said Ginny Terzano, a spokeswoman for the company.“We are trying to work with Congress to get the cap increased,” Ms. Terzano said. “Our real preference here is that there not be a cap at all.”Compete America, a coalition that includes Microsoft, the chip maker Intel, the business software company Oracle and others, voiced its opposition to the visa cap in a statement Tuesday.'"
"'07-04-05,'1','Struggling with an epidemic of drug fatalities, New Mexico has enacted a groundbreaking law providing immunity from prosecution for people who come forward to help drug users suffering overdoses.The act, signed into law Tuesday by Gov. Bill Richardson, prevents the authorities from prosecuting on the basis of evidence “gained as a result of the seeking of medical assistance.”It also protects drug users themselves from prosecution if the process of seeking help for an overdose provides the only evidence against them.The legislation, which was popularly known as the 911 Good Samaritan bill, is the first of its kind in the nation, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.In a statement yesterday, Mr. Richardson, who is running for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2008, said: “I have always been committed to prevention and rehabilitation of drug users. If we can encourage people to save themselves or others from a drug-related death or trauma, then we should do that. This bill will encourage families and friends of addicts to seek medical care and prevent their loved one from dying.”The action was praised by the Drug Policy Alliance, which works to ease drug penalties. The group said New Mexico had the worst overdose problem in the country, with about one death a day.'"
"'07-04-05,'1','BOSTON, April 4 — Federal prosecutors have ended their investigation of whether William M. Bulger, the former president of the University of Massachusetts, thwarted efforts to find his fugitive brother, James, a mob figure charged with 21 murders, The Boston Globe reported Wednesday.A grand jury that was impaneled to investigate whether to charge William Bulger with perjury and obstruction of justice was allowed to expire, The Globe reported, because there was not enough evidence to bring charges.The investigation, The Globe said, was focused on grand jury testimony Mr. Bulger gave in 2001, in which he admitted to speaking with his brother and not urging him to turn himself into the authorities.A spokeswoman for United States attorney here, Michael Sullivan, refused to comment. Thomas Kiley, a lawyer for Mr. Bulger, would not confirm the report.“If the story is true, it brings some relief to a family that needs relief,” Mr. Kiley said. “The family has been pressured, and to have an alleviation of that is right, just and well put.”'"
"'07-04-05,'1','The Metropolitan Opera’s 40th-anniversary gala on Tuesday gave a reasonably accurate account of what life in the Met’s Lincoln Center home has been and what it hasn’t been. There were scenes from Puccini’s “Bohème,” Massenet’s “Manon” and Donizetti’s “Elisir d’Amore.” The tenor Rolando Villazón and the soprano Anna Netrebko showed up in all three.Good things have happened in 40 years. James Levine has assembled an opera orchestra of remarkable refinement and flexibility. Given a size one and a half to two times that of a normal opera house, the acoustics are better than one might expect. The best singers find the Met an essential destination for their careers. The house has a stage crew of virtuoso efficiency. Sets and costumes are of the highest quality.Looks are important here, and that applies to singers. Opera finds itself jostling for public attention and surrounded by the improbable attractiveness of movie stars and television personalities. So here on Tuesday was Ms. Netrebko, a beauty of some celebrity, and Mr. Villazón, with a frail appeal to melt any maternal heart.Ms. Netrebko seemed more at home on this big stage. There is a slightly metallic spine to her sound and it helps the voice carry easily in this hall. For better or worse the Met has bred a new kind of singer, one that can penetrate considerable distances and still remain clear and under control. As with the National Football League and its 300-pound linemen, a biological call has been sent out to nature, and nature has responded.But not always. Mr. Villazón has a very nice tenor voice, his fastness and looseness with phrasing and tempo notwithstanding. Standing, almost antlike, in the middle of Franco Zeffirelli’s oversize set for “La Bohème,” however, he pushed uncomfortably. All the singers onstage pushed, fearing (with justification) that if they did not, they would vanish into the scenery. Puccini’s subtle, almost chamber-music ensemble in Act I became a shouting match.The Zeffirelli scene was an uncomfortable reminder of the new Met’s 1966 opening with Samuel Barber’s “Antony and Cleopatra.” In both instances, medium-size operas were crushed by grandiose productions.'"

"'07-04-05,'1','My road with Robinson goes back to 1968 when I played my first college football game for Morgan State against his Grambling Tigers in Yankee Stadium. The game was part of Robinson’s vision to take black college football out of small, on-campus stadiums and showcase it in larger venues.That afternoon in New York, more than 62,000 fans flocked to Yankee Stadium to watch Morgan defeat Grambling, 9-7. This was a world of intercollegiate athletics few outside the circle knew existed, a world of high-stepping bands and hard-hitting football at a time when many of the best black athletes were concentrated in black colleges.Morgan won that afternoon, though we would never again come close to beating an Eddie Robinson-coached team.Robinson was an every-person’s coach. You might not have known him or met him in person, but trust me, if you ever had a coach you cared about, who made you angry, who could make you feel lower than low or higher than high, you knew Eddie Robinson. He could talk trash with the best, tell tall tales with the best and inspire with the best.When Harris was a high school senior in Monroe, La., Robinson told him that if he came to Grambling he’d make him a pro.“I had thought about going to school up North to be on TV, to have the opportunity to represent my neighborhood,” Harris once said. “That was appealing — the idea of paving the way for other kids. But it got hard to say no to Coach Robinson.“Coach came by my house one night. He had been to New York to do a show with Howard Cosell. Grambling had a lot of players in the N.F.L. and Cosell asked Coach Robinson point-blank: ‘You’ve produced so many N.F.L. players. Why can’t you produce a quarterback?’ And that stuck with him. He got off the plane in Monroe. Came straight to my house. He told me that if I came to Grambling, in four years I’d be ready for the N.F.L. He told me that he knew I could play quarterback. He said, ‘Howard Cosell challenged me and I’m here to let you know I think you can do it.’ ”Harris had an outstanding career at Grambling. As a three-year starter, he led Grambling to a combined 24-5-1 record. But after being drafted by the Buffalo Bills in 1969 in the eighth round, Harris was so disappointed that he contemplated not reporting to camp. Robinson again provided the historical perspective, challenging Harris. He told Harris that he had to report to camp.“He thought I could play quarterback in the N.F.L.,” Harris said. “He knew I could make it. If I didn’t go, the other guys coming along, it would take this much time for the next guy to get a chance and the next guy. But if I go and make it, it may give other guys an opportunity to play, or some young kid growing up will see me play and then they would want to play.”Harris reported to camp and went on to become the first African-American to build an extended career as an N.F.L. quarterback.Nearly 20 years earlier, Robinson had given Tank Younger a similar pep talk after he was drafted in 1949, becoming the first player to be drafted by the N.F.L. from a historically black college.During an interview in his office at Grambling several years ago, Robinson recalled how he had told Younger that his being drafted represented a great opportunity for black college football. “If you fail,” he said, “it’s no telling when another player will get an opportunity. They’ll say, ‘We took the best you had and he failed.’ ”Robinson was hired as the Grambling head coach in 1941 and retired in 1997. His tenure at Grambling extended from an era when the great black athlete routinely attended a historically black college to an era of integration when black coaches were forced to dig deeper to find diamonds in the rough.Robinson’s passing on Tuesday marks the end of an era. At the same time, Robinson’s legacy should challenge a generation of young coaches at historically black colleges and universities to revitalize their mission, to define a new role and give renewed purpose to the institution that Robinson represented with such vigor.He leaves an incredible standard: one school, one football program, thousands of former players who are much better for having had him in their lives.There will never be another.'"

"'07-04-06,'0','Separately, the New York State attorney general’s office said today that it had issued subpoenas to both Student Loan Xpress and CIT Group, which has owned Student Loan Xpress since 2005, asking for any information about any benefits they may have given to federal or state officials.John Milgrim, a spokesman for the attorney general, Andrew M. Cuomo, said the office had also issued a subpoena to Sallie Mae, a large student lender, asking for a list of all of its employees who worked for the federal education department in the last six years, as well as any communications between them and the company during that period.Mr. Fontana’s involvement with the company emerged a day after a widening investigation into the student loan industry revealed that three senior financial aid officials at Columbia University, the University of Texas at Austin and the University of Southern California had also held shares at the same time.Filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission show that Mr. Fontana sold 10,500 shares in the company in 2003, when they were valued at around $10 a share.Mr. Fontana did not return calls, and it was not clear what he had originally paid for his shares. At least two of the three university financial aid directors originally paid about $1 a share.C. Curtis Ritter, a spokesman for CIT, the current owner of Student Loan Xpress, declined on Thursday to answer questions about Mr. Fontana’s dealings with the company.CIT Group Inc. also has a top university official on its board: John R. Ryan, the chancellor of the State University of New York, which has 64 campuses and more than 400,000 students.In a telephone interview on Thursday, Chancellor Ryan said he believed strongly that there was no conflict between his positions as SUNY’s chancellor and as a CIT director, a post that paid him nearly $150,000 in cash, stock and stock options. He earns $340,000 from SUNY.As the Education Department responded to questions about Mr. Fontana’s stock ownership, the University of Texas and the University of Southern California followed Columbia’s lead and suspended their financial aid directors pending the outcome of internal investigations into the officials’ relationship with Student Loan Xpress. Columbia also removed the loan company from its spot on the university’s preferred lending list.All three universities had given Student Loan Xpress a spot on the lists. Students generally rely on the lists for seeking a loan rather than shopping for the best terms.Mr. Fontana’s participation in the stock sale, which was first reported by the New America Foundation, a Washington policy institute that has focused on student loan issues, caught the attention of lawmakers already looking into the student loan industry.Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts and chairman of the Education Committee, faxed a letter to Secretary Spellings Thursday night saying, “These circumstances raise serious concerns about the impartiality of Mr. Fontana’s work at the department.” Mr. Kennedy asked her to provide documents about the case.John Edwards, the Democratic candidate for president, also weighed in on the issue Thursday, arguing that students should borrow directly from the government. “We need to fix the student loan program to take banks — which are just an expensive middleman — out of the process,” he said in a statement.The New York State Ethics Commission twice approved Mr. Ryan’s membership on the CIT board, in July 2003, when he was president at SUNY’s Maritime College, and again in July 2005, when he became SUNY’s acting chancellor.Mr. Ryan said he had been unaware until Thursday that Maritime College, where he was president for three years, had listed Student Loan Xpress as a preferred lender last year, after he had left the campus. He was Maritime’s president from 2002 to 2005. He recently announced his intention to step down as SUNY’s chancellor at the end of May.“I don’t make loans,” he said. “I don’t make any decisions as chancellor about who is going to be permitted to make student loans at each university or college. They have professionals that do that.”Mr. Ryan said that CIT, a New York-based company that specializes in commercial and consumer finance, had not been in the student loan business when he joined its board in 2003. He said it entered that business in 2005 by acquiring Student Loan Xpress and its parent, Education Lending Group. He said he had undoubtedly voted on the acquisition, but had not been consulted individually about it.At the time of the acquisition, CIT’s chairman and chief executive, Jeffrey M. Peek, said student lending was attractive because it was a “higher growth business with predictable performance characteristics.”In its 2006 annual report, CIT said that its student loan business “has shown outstanding growth” and that its Student Loan Servicing Center handled more than $6 billion in loans a year, up from $1.4 billion. It said it had expanded its marketing and servicing capabilities in the field last year. CIT had a student lending portfolio of $8.8 billion as of Dec. 31, 2006,In the 2005 clearance statement for Mr. Ryan , the executive director of the state ethics commission, Karl J. Sleight, said Mr. Ryan’s outside work could not be done during state work hours, should not interfere with his official duties. Mr. Sleight also said, “Absent an open and competitively bid contract, you are prohibited from selling goods or services to any State agency.”Mr. Ryan said that when he was first recruited to join SUNY, he had been encouraged to sit on corporate and nonprofit boards. He said many companies that do business with universities have college and university presidents on their boards.CIT also has at least two former college officials on its board: Thomas H. Kean, the former New Jersey governor who was president of Drew University until June 2005; and Peter J. Tobin, the former dean of the business school at St. John’s University, who also served as special assistant to the president there from September 2003 to May 2005, a few months after CIT entered the student lending business.Dominic Scianna, a spokesman for St. John’s, said that the university was on break and that neither Mr. Tobin nor the university’s president could be reached for comment.Mr. Kean said he saw no conflict in his positions in 2005. “I was making no decisions for the university at that point and the university had no connection with the company,” he said.SUNY was one of eight universities that recently agreed to abide by a code of conduct drawn up by Mr. Cuomo’s office. It prohibits universities and their employees from receiving anything of value from any lending institution in exchange for any advantage and requires them to disclose the criteria used to select preferred lenders.Columbia sent a lengthy e-mail message of reassurance to students on Thursday about the stock sales by David Charlow, the director of financial aid for its undergraduate college and engineering school. “We believe that this has had no adverse financial consequences for students and their families,” the university said.'"
"'07-04-06,'0','The line had initially reported that all 1,153 passengers and 391 crew members had been safely evacuated on motorboats, lifeboats and fishing vessels. About two-thirds of the passengers were American citizens.The Sea Diamond rammed an underwater bed of rocks in the island’s lagoon, formed by a giant volcanic explosion about 3,500 years ago, as it was approaching the main island’s harbor to dock. The hull was damaged and it began to sink about a nautical mile from shore. A distress signal was issued, and the passengers and crew were evacuated over the course of about three hours. The ship sank below the surface of the sea about 18 hours after striking the rocks.The incident cast a pall over the start of Greece’s high tourism season, one that had until then been marked by growing demand for cruises, mainly from American travelers. French, German, Spanish and British tourists were also among the Sea Diamond’s passengers.“We were on the deck watching the ship steer into the harbor, when we heard a loud bump,” an American passenger told Greek national television. “Then, the water in the pool started to spill out like a tidal wave. And then, the ship started tilting to the right. We were terribly scared.”Though some were able to step on to lifeboats, many of the passengers had to climb down rope ladders to reach waiting rescue vessels. Still, the operation appeared to go smoothly and no injuries were reported.The missing French tourists had been traveling in a four-berth cabin fairly low in the ship, according to officials of the Greek merchant marine ministry. Since the incident, divers have twice examined the wreckage, and the Greek tourism minister, Fanny Palli Petralia, has spoken to the missing man’s wife.“The lady said her cabin was flooded with water when the ship struck the rocks,” Mrs. Petralia said. “She was not sure her husband and daughter had made it out, because things happened so suddenly.”The Sea Diamond, 489 feet in length, set sail from the port of Pireaus, near Athens, last Monday, on a week-long island-hopping cruise in the Aegean. Rescued passengers were ferried back to Pireaus today. At least 70 of them, traumatized by the accident, refused to make the return journey by ship.Investigators have begun interviewing the Sea Diamond’s captain and crew in connection with the accident. Mrs. Petralla said that whoever was responsible for the accident would be held accountable “in the strictest way.”Greece, she said, “is a major tourism destination, and incidents like this must not be allowed to occur.”'"
"'07-04-06,'0','China is poised to surpass the United States as the world’s largest emitter of carbon dioxide, the main heat-trapping greenhouse gas, and it has been under growing diplomatic pressure — along with the United States — to agree to binding limits on emissions.In February, the panel released a summary of basic climate science, concluding with 90 percent certainty that humans were the main cause of warming since 1950.In this report, focusing on effects of warming, the group for the first time described how species, water supplies, polar ice sheets, and regional climate conditions were already responding to the global buildup of heat.At a news conference here, the panel’s cochairman, Dr. Parry, said widespread effects were already measurable, with much more to come.“We’re no longer arm-waving with models,” he said. “This is empirical information on the ground.”The report said that climate patterns were shifting in ways that would bring benefits in some places — including more rainfall and longer growing seasons in high latitudes, opening Arctic seaways, and fewer deaths from cold weather — but that significant human hardship and ecological losses would be seen in others.The panel said the long-term outlook for all regions was for trouble if temperatures rise by 3 to 5 degrees Fahrenheit. Consequences would range from the likely extinction of perhaps one-quarter of the world’s species to the eventual inundation of coasts and islands inhabited by hundreds of millions of people.The worst effects threaten regions that are mainly poor and already facing dangers from existing climate and coastal hazards, the authors said.“It’s the poorest of the poor in the world — and this includes poor people even in prosperous societies — who are going to be the worst hit,” said Rajendra K Pachauri, the chairman of the panel and an energy expert from India. “People who are poor are least equipped to be able to adapt to the impacts of climate change, and therefore, in some sense, this does become a global responsibility, in my view.”The report, written by hundreds of scientists and reviewed by outside experts and government officials, warned that adaptation is essential because temperatures and seas will inevitably rise for decades, given the current buildup of carbon dioxide and other long-lived greenhouse gases already in the atmosphere.But it said that efforts to reduce emissions could reduce, delay or avoid some of the harmful outcomes.Final details were completed by hundreds of scientists in Brussels early this morning, and approved by officials from more than 100 countries. The report, focusing on the measured and projected impact of warming and the possible responses, was posted on the Web this morning at www.ipcc.ch.Some authors said that the report removed any doubt about the urgency of acting to curb emissions of greenhouse gases.“The warnings are clear about the scale of the projected changes to the planet,” said Bill Hare, an author of the new report and a visiting scientist at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Potsdam, Germany. “Essentially, there’s going to be a mass extinction within the next 100 years unless climate change is limited,” added Dr. Hare, who previously worked for the environmetal advocacy group Greenpeace.“These impacts have been known for many years, and are now seen with greater clarity in this report,” he said. “That clarity is perhaps the last warning we’re going to get before we actually have to report in the next I.P.C.C. review that we’re seeing the disaster unfolding.”James L. Connaughton, the chairman of the White House Council on Environmental Quality, said that some of the findings in the report, particularly the prospect of intensifying coastal damage from rising seas, were “of high concern,” but he noted the panel also foresaw benefits to agriculture in temperate regions as well.Overall, he said, the analysis reinforced the need for industrialized countries to foster economic growth in developing countries, and thus to help them reduce their vulnerability to climate shocks.One of the starkest changes projected in the report is an overheating and parching of southern Europe, particularly in summer, and the blossoming of northern regions, particularly Scandinavia.But the report stressed that outsized threats would face communities in Africa, the crowded river deltas of south Asia, and low-lying islands around the world.It also found that if investments are made now to adapt to climate and coastal changes, some disruption and damage could be held at bay.In one section of the 1,572 pages of supporting documentation, for example, the report projects that hundreds of millions of people could be flooded out of homes by rising seas by 2080. But if steady investments are made in sea walls and other coastal protections, vulnerability could be sharply cut.“The actual outcome in terms of damages and ruined lives and costs depends heavily on the response — the response of individuals to deal with the changes and governments to organize and anticipate and deal with this in advance,” said Michael Oppenheimer, a climate scientist at Princeton and an author of the report.The meeting dragged on in a marathon session through the night before Dr. Pachaui emerged this morning to stand on a blue armchair and announce to reporters that an agreement had been reached between scientists and government officials over the final details of a 21-page summary.Under pressure from countries including Russia, China and Saudi Arabia, sections on coral damage and hurricane trends were softened in the summary. They also got the authors to drop an illustration showing how different emissions policies might limit the harm done.Officials from those countries argued that data in the report did not support the level of certainty expressed in the final draft.But some authors were not assuaged. The final document was “much less quantified and much vaguer and much less striking than it could have been,” said Stéphane Hallegatte, a participant from France’s International Center for Research on the Environment and Development.Negotiations were also prolonged by European delegates’ demand that the final report reflect the need to cut back on greenhouse gases — and not just adapt to new conditions.“Adaptation will only work if climate change is not too large and not too fast,” Mr. Hallegatte said.The panel, created in 1988 and run under the auspices of the United Nations, has sometimes endured criticism for allowing governments to shape the summaries of its periodic reviews of climate science, which fill thousands of pages of reports.But it remains, by many accounts, the closest thing to a barometer for tracking the level of scientific understanding of the causes and consequences of global warming.Reports from the panel are released only every half-decade or so, and this year’s suite of three studies — on basic science, impacts of warming, and options for cutting emissions — were likely to guide policymakers for years to come.They also are likely to be a central factor determining how much pressure nations face to extend the Kyoto Protocol, which mandates cuts in emissions, beyond 2012, when its terms lapse.Next month, the panel will release a report on options for limiting emissions of the greenhouse gases, and late in the year it will publish a final synthesis report.Stephen H. Schneider, a climatologist at Stanford University, said Russia and China were among countries that opposed inclusion of the mitigation scenarios supported so strongly by Europe.He said the United States had asked that statements about ice sheets were removed but that the “Americans were helpful much more than they were harmful.”Dr. Schneider, however, was strongly critical of the Chinese, who he said marshaled technical arguments that had upset other scientists, including Cynthia Rosenzweig of the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies, who made a formal written protest to Dr. Pachauri early on Friday, adding drama to the final hours of the week-long meeting.The Chinese had been disputing how much confidence to ascribe to evidence that natural systems were responding to climate change, said Schneider.The Chinese “wouldn’t relent and after the protest all the lead authors and most of the delegations broke into applause,” he said. “I’ve never seen anything like it — that’s how angry people were.”Dr. Rosenzweig said her decision to walk out of the conference after delivering her protest even prompted some delegates to ask whether she was resigning.“I wasn’t storming out,” she clarified later in an interview. “I took a break.”Dr. Rosenzweig said she was satisfied with a compromise forged later on Friday morning under which the final summary explained how climate change was putting pressure on the environment, even though some words were removed. She said there was “no compromise with the underlying science.” She declined to name the governments that provoked her protest.'"
"'07-04-06,'0','Geraldine Blue Bird, who became a symbol of the extreme poverty that plagued the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation when President Bill Clinton visited it in July 1999, was sentenced in Rapid City on Wednesday to 34 years in federal prison. Ms. Blue Bird was convicted last fall of conspiracy to distribute cocaine, possession with intent to distribute cocaine, possession of a firearm in relation to drug trafficking and conspiracy to distribute marijuana. She was “pretty much the ringleader” of a conspiracy based out of her home that trafficked an estimated $2 million worth of cocaine from Denver to Nebraska and South Dakota over three years, beginning in 2002, the local United States attorney, Marty Jackley, said. Twenty-eight people, including family members, have been indicted in the investigation.'"
"'07-04-06,'0','A nuclear reactor at the Indian Point power station was shut down for nearly a day because of a mechanical problem, but the malfunction posed no danger to the public or workers, plant officials and federal regulators said yesterday. Workers shut Indian Point 3, one of the station’s two active reactors, shortly after 4 a.m. Tuesday. Officials said a water pump that feeds the plant’s steam generators had malfunctioned. No radiation was released, they said. The 31-year-old plant resumed service about 1 a.m. Wednesday, after an employee analysis determined that it was safe to restart, said Neil Sheehan, a spokesman for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.'"
"'07-04-06,'0','“We are providing the department’s inspector general all relevant documents regarding this matter,” Samara Yudof, a spokeswoman, said in a statement. Officials declined to answer questions about the stock transaction.The government documents, filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, show that Mr. Fontana sold 10,500 shares in the company in 2003, when they were valued at around $10 a share. He came to the department in 2002 and at the time of the sale was in a slightly more junior position than now, overseeing lenders in the student loan program.Mr. Fontana did not return calls, and it was not clear what he had originally paid for his shares. At least two of the three university financial aid directors originally paid about $1 a share.Student Loan Xpress is currently owned by the financial services company CIT Group. C. Curtis Ritter, a spokesman for CIT, declined to answer questions about Mr. Fontana’s dealings with the company.CIT Group Inc. also has a top university official on its board: John R. Ryan, the chancellor of the State University of New York, which has 64 campuses and more than 400,000 students.In a telephone interview yesterday, Chancellor Ryan said he believed strongly that there was no conflict between his positions as SUNY’s chancellor and as a CIT director, a post that paid him nearly $150,000 in cash, stock and stock options. He earns $340,000 from SUNY.As the Education Department responded to questions about Mr. Fontana’s stock ownership, the University of Texas and the University of Southern California followed Columbia’s lead and suspended their financial aid directors pending the outcome of internal investigations into the officials’ relationship with Student Loan Xpress. Columbia also removed the loan company from its spot on the university’s preferred lending list.All three universities had given Student Loan Xpress a spot on the lists. Students generally rely on the lists for seeking a loan rather than shopping for the best terms.Mr. Fontana’s participation in the stock sale, which was first reported by the New America Foundation, a Washington policy institute that has focused on student loan issues, caught the attention of lawmakers already looking into the student loan industry.Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts and chairman of the Education Committee, faxed a letter to Secretary Spellings last night saying, “These circumstances raise serious concerns about the impartiality of Mr. Fontana’s work at the department.” Mr. Kennedy asked her to provide documents about the case.John Edwards, the Democratic candidate for president, also weighed in on the issue yesterday, arguing that students should borrow directly from the government. “We need to fix the student loan program to take banks — which are just an expensive middleman — out of the process,” he said in a statement.Andrew M. Cuomo, the New York attorney general who has been investigating the relationship between student lenders and universities, has issued subpoenas to Columbia and to the CIT Group, and requested information from the University of Southern California and the University of Texas.A senior lawyer in Mr. Cuomo’s office, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the investigation is continuing, said, “As we gather the information we have subpoenaed from CIT, and we’ve subpoenaed both documents and testimony, we certainly will get to the bottom of all these relationships.”The New York State Ethics Commission twice approved Mr. Ryan’s membership on the CIT board, in July 2003, when he was president at SUNY’s Maritime College, and again in July 2005, when he became SUNY’s acting chancellor.Mr. Ryan said he had been unaware until yesterday that Maritime College, where he was president for three years, had listed Student Loan Xpress as a preferred lender last year, after he had left the campus. He was Maritime’s president from 2002 to 2005. He recently announced his intention to step down as SUNY’s chancellor at the end of May.“I don’t make loans,” he said. “I don’t make any decisions as chancellor about who is going to be permitted to make student loans at each university or college. They have professionals that do that.”Mr. Ryan said that CIT, a New York-based company that specializes in commercial and consumer finance, had not been in the student loan business when he joined its board in 2003. He said it entered that business in 2005 with the acquisition of Education Lending Group, the parent company for Student Loan Xpress. He said he had undoubtedly voted on the acquisition, but had not been consulted individually about it.At the time of the acquisition, CIT’s chairman and chief executive, Jeffrey M. Peek, said student lending was attractive because it was a “higher growth business with predictable performance characteristics.”In its 2006 annual report, CIT said that its student loan business “has shown outstanding growth” and that its Student Loan Servicing Center handled more than $6 billion in loans a year, up from $1.4 billion. It said it had expanded its marketing and servicing capabilities in the field last year. CIT had a student lending portfolio of $8.8 billion as of Dec. 31, 2006,In the 2005 clearance statement for Mr. Ryan , the executive director of the state ethics commission, Karl J. Sleight, said Mr. Ryan’s outside work could not be done during state work hours, should not interfere with his official duties. Mr. Sleight also said, “Absent an open and competitively bid contract, you are prohibited from selling goods or services to any State agency.”Mr. Ryan said that when he was first recruited to join SUNY, he had been encouraged to sit on corporate and nonprofit boards. He said many companies that do business with universities have college and university presidents on their boards.CIT also has at least two former college officials on its board: Thomas H. Kean, the former New Jersey governor who was president of Drew University until June 2005; and Peter J. Tobin, the former dean of the business school at St. John’s University, who also served as special assistant to the president there from September 2003 to May 2005, a few months after CIT entered the student lending business.Dominic Scianna, a spokesman for St. John’s, said that the university was on break and that neither Mr. Tobin nor the university’s president could be reached for comment.Mr. Kean said he saw no conflict in his positions in 2005. “I was making no decisions for the university at that point and the university had no connection with the company,” he said.SUNY was one of eight universities that recently agreed to abide by a code of conduct drawn up by Mr. Cuomo’s office. It prohibits universities and their employees from receiving anything of value from any lending institution in exchange for any advantage and requires them to disclose the criteria used to select preferred lenders.Columbia yesterday sent a lengthy e-mail message of reassurance to students about the stock sales by David Charlow, the director of financial aid for its undergraduate college and engineering school. “We believe that this has had no adverse financial consequences for students and their families,” the university said.'"
"'07-04-06,'0','But a third suspect, identified as Francisco J. Herrera-Genao, 22, also of New Brunswick, who was said to be armed with a rifle and wearing a sweatshirt and only one shoe, fled into a densely wooded area of horse farms and country clubs and was hunted into the evening by more than 300 troopers and officers with dogs and helicopters.Roads were closed, schools and businesses were locked down and officers with drawn guns went door to door at homes and farms, advising people to stay inside. The search was to continue all night, officials said.“There’s a lot of tension, I can tell you,” said Kate Sarles, the police commissioner in neighboring Branchburg Township, where the search was under way last night. “People are coming home and locking themselves in. Obviously the man is desperate.”The shooting took place shortly after 11:30 a.m. near a PNC Bank on Route 22 in the rural township of about 15,000 people, where sensational crimes are rare. Witnesses said the suspects, riding in two vehicles, pulled into the parking lot of a garden supply store across the highway. One remained in his car while two stepped out and began to approach the bank.A group of federal agents and state troopers who had been following the suspects suddenly swarmed in on the gunmen, who were intercepted before they reached the door of the bank.Witnesses said they heard three shots, or bursts from automatic weapons, and F.B.I. officials later said that the suspects had not fired their weapons. One official said that Mr. Bush had been shot from behind at close range. He was taken by helicopter to University Hospital in Newark, and while he was alive on arrival doctors were unable to save him, officials said.Mr. Bush had testified in two high-profile cases, the successful prosecution of terrorists in the 1998 bombing of American Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, and the conviction of James C. Kopp, an anti-abortion activist, in the death of Dr. Barnett A. Slepian, an obstetrician.Explaining yesterday’s events, the F.B.I. said: “Special Agent Bush and his team were in pursuit of heavily armed serial bank robbers who are believed to be responsible for four bank robberies. In two of those robberies, the suspects, armed with assault weapons, fired rounds while inside the bank.”The previous robberies occurred at a Commerce Bank in Piscataway on Feb. 8 and at three branches of the Bank of America — in East Brunswick on Feb. 16, in Ocean Township on March 2 and in South Brunswick on March 16. Investigators at first believed that only four men were involved, but now say that as many as six to eight may have participated.The authorities said the robbers in those cases wore ski masks, baseball hats, black gloves, hooded sweatshirts, trench coats and work boots, and carried a big money bag. They were heavily armed and carried additional ammunition. Their weapons were believed to have included a .380-caliber pistol and AK-47 assault weapons with 30-round magazines, officials said.They also used Hondas that had been stolen the night before each of the robberies. The cars were parked in front of the banks during the robberies, with the engines running and doors open. After the getaways, the robbers switched to other vehicles and abandoned the stolen cars in residential areas or parking lots.At a news conference late last night, Pedro Ruiz, the acting special agent in charge of the F.B.I.’s Newark office, said the task force investigators had information that the suspects intended to rob the PNC Bank in Readington Township yesterday and had been following them.The three suspects, in two cars, drove into the parking lot of Arvins Farm and Garden Center, across Route 22 from the bank, said James Margolin, another F.B.I. spokesman. One remained in his car while the others got out and walked toward the bank, but they were intercepted before they went in, he said.Agent Ruiz said the gunmen had fired no shots in the confrontation, with all the bullets coming from law enforcement officers’ guns.Witnesses in the bank, including Josh Bavosa, 35, who was making a deposit, said they heard three bursts of gunfire. When they looked out the big plate-glass windows, they said, they saw men lying on the ground. Moments later, they said, a large number of police cars converged on the scene.Maynor Veliz, 19, was working in the back of the garden center when he heard the shots. He said he looked out and saw one man lying on the ground by a white car with its windows broken. Moments later, he said, he saw a swarm of police officers converge on the scene.Mr. Berrios and Mr. Cruz were seized there, Agent Ruiz said.It was unclear how one of the suspects got away. The man, identified as Mr. Herrera-Genao, was last seen carrying a rifle and running into a heavily wooded area behind the bank that lies between two country clubs. The fugitive was described as Hispanic, at least 6 feet tall, wearing a sweatshirt and one shoe. His other shoe was found in the woods near Raritan Valley Community College.He and the other two suspects were charged yesterday with attempted armed bank robbery, which is punishable by up to 25 years in prison, law enforcement officials said. Another man, Efrain Lynn, 21, of New Brunswick, was arrested at another location later and charged with attempted armed bank robbery in connection with the March 16 holdup, the F.B.I. said.As hundreds of state police troopers and police officers from surrounding communities converged on the scene yesterday, a huge hunt began. The search, coordinated by the state police and using numerous dogs, spread out through a densely wooded area north of Route 22 and south of Interstate 78 between the Fox Hollow Golf Course and the Fiddler’s Elbow Country Club.At least four helicopters circled the area all afternoon, witnesses said. Route 22, an east-west thoroughfare that cuts across Hunterdon County, was closed in both directions for much of the day in the vicinity of the shooting, as were many secondary roads. Officers with drawn guns went door to door at homes and businesses, advising people to stay inside. They also searched barns and other farm buildings in the area.Vincent DellaPello, 34, whose family owns a 50-acre horse farm in the area of the search, said the area consisted of dense woods, bounded by pastures and horse farms. “You could get lost in there,” he said.At the PNC Bank, the doors were locked — with employees and customers inside — for two and a half hours. It was a day of watchful waiting for many people in the area.“At various times throughout the day, there has been a flood of marked cars, unmarked cars, state troopers, and you can hear the helicopters off and on,” said Penny Brown, 51, who was taking care of her mother at her home on Lamington Road, which was closed. By day’s end, officers were letting people return to their homes.'"
"'07-04-06,'0','LONDON, April 5 — The British official in charge of reaching out to disaffected Muslims indicated in a speech on Thursday that the government intended to take some steps to regulate and try to influence the affairs of Muslim religious institutions and mosques.The official, Ruth Kelly, the minister of local government and communities, said imams working in government hospitals and prisons would be required to meet certain criteria, including having a good grasp of English.Speaking at the Muslim Cultural Center, a mosque in a relatively affluent area of London, she also said the government planned to offer financial benefits to mosques that registered as charities and showed themselves willing to take a stand against extremism.Ms. Kelly said she was determined to “isolate and push out a tiny minority who spread hatred and intolerance.” The government would do this, she said, by emphasizing the need for Muslim immigrants to be British as well as Muslim.A number of imams in Britain who were born in Pakistan speak limited English and preach in Urdu, a situation that security experts say inhibits the ability of the government to know what is going on in some mosques and prisons. Increasingly, the Blair government has said it is concerned that radical Muslim preachers are influencing inmates and encouraging prison networks devoted to extremist ideologies.'"
"'07-04-06,'0','Let’s say you are very wealthy and have $25 million to invest in a portfolio of hedge funds. Banks like BNP Paribas, Royal Bank of Canada or Barclays will leverage your investment, say four to one, allowing you to invest $100 million, using derivatives. Barclays estimates that roughly $60 billion to $80 billion in leverage is being put on by investors in hedge funds or funds of hedge funds. Other market players say it is more than double that.More leverage means more money to put to work, thus potentially producing higher returns. Banks take comfort from the diversity of many strategies in many hedge funds.Investors are naturally jazzed by this prospect. Returns at funds of funds have come down, and volatility from fund of funds is often low, making leverage look like a reasonable way to jump-start returns. And private banking executives say it is not uncommon for their wealthy clients to have portfolios with 100 percent allocation to hedge funds.“It’s like a retail investor buying on margin,” said Marty Malloy, managing director in charge of Prime Services at Barclays Capital in New York. “The investor wants to increase the overall return on capital.”Except this time around, the investor is buying into an entity that is already leveraged, a hedge fund. The ripple effect — leverage upon leverage — looks a little scary. Go back to the $25 million example. You take on four to one leverage to create a portfolio of $100 million. You invest $5 million in 20 hedge funds. The markets have a bad month and the portfolio falls 5 percent, to $95 million.Your equity is now $20 million, down from $25 million and your leverage is now 4.75 to one rather than the four required by your agreement with the bank. So you have to sell an additional $15 million.As investors redeem, funds may be forced to sell to meet those redemptions. If the markets continue to fall, hedge fund managers are stuck selling into a falling market, perhaps setting off their own margin calls from their prime brokers. Strategies that were not supposed to be correlated are tied together, and it becomes apparent that many funds and banks are in the same trades. Suddenly the world does not look so rosy.There are other fun variations, like start-up leverage, or money that hedge funds borrow at the outset to enable them to put more money to work.Say you have $10 million from your friends and family to start a hedge fund. But to be considered a player you have to have $50 million. You borrow $40 million from a bank in the form of preferred equity. Presto! You run a $50 million fund.“Each half point of return puts you in a new ball park in terms of ability to raise capital,” said Victor L. Zimmermann, a lawyer at Curtis, Mallet-Prevost, Colt & Mosle. He estimates preferred equity deals are used for funds up to $1 billion in size.These structures can do wonders for compensation. Recall that hedge fund managers generally take home 2 percent of assets under management and 20 percent of profits as “incentive” or performance fees. According to Mr. Zimmermann, managers get to take home 20 percent of profits on the leveraged portfolio.So funds are levered, investors are levered and funds’ investments are levered.“The concern is, how many people are on that chain?” says Jonathan Ende, managing member of Ende Capital Group, structured products consulting firm.Still, he thinks it is all within reason. “If it does break, the markets are pretty resilient.”Prime brokers and regulators agree with Mr. Ende, saying that leverage levels are fine these days. But the markets have not been tested in any significant way. There have been terrorist attacks around the world, the collapse of Amaranth, a $9.5 billion hedge fund, and a messy and seemingly unsolvable war in Iraq. And the markets have rallied at every turn.The test will come when a bad month —like this February — is followed by two more bad months.Then the leverage picture will look very different indeed.'"
"'07-04-06,'0','Menu Foods, which last month recalled more than 90 brands of its “cuts and gravy” pet food, said yesterday that it had extended the period of time covered by its recall to include food made after Nov. 8, 2006. The company, based in Ontario, initially recalled only food made from Dec. 3, 2006, to March 6, 2007.The company also added 20 additional varieties of those brands to the recall list yesterday. Information about the recalled pet food can be found at www.fda.gov/oc/opacom/hottopics/petfood.html.Menu Foods said it acted after a supplier, ChemNutra of Las Vegas, recalled all wheat gluten it had imported from the Xuzhou Anying Biologic Technology Development Company of Wangdien, China. ChemNutra said Wednesday that the F.D.A. had found melamine in the gluten. The agency said it was now testing all wheat gluten from China.The Chinese government said yesterday that no wheat gluten had been exported to the United States or Canada. Xuzhou Anying denied it had ever shipped wheat gluten to either country.“We are a trading company and don’t manufacture the product,” added Mao Lijun, the company’s general manager. Michael Rogers, director of the Division of Field Investigations for the F.D.A., said records showed that the tainted gluten came from China.“We fully expect the Chinese government’s cooperation and assistance in our further investigation,” Mr. Rogers said.Mr. Rogers and Dr. Sundlof said the gluten did not enter the human food supply. The agency said that it was still investigating how the melamine got into the gluten, and that it had notified all companies that had received it.Though melamine has been found in the food and in the urine and kidneys of pets that have eaten the food, officials and scientists are not sure whether the chemical actually caused pets to get sick.Melamine, which is also used as a slow-release fertilizer, is generally not known to be toxic. Some theories are that it might act as a marker for another unknown toxin that causes renal failure in pets, Dr. Sundlof said, or that cats and dogs are extremely sensitive to melamine.“We still have a lot of work to do to understand why melamine is involved, as it is a relatively nontoxic substance,” Dr. Sundlof said. “We are relatively certain that there is a connection here someplace.”The F.D.A. said it had received more than 12,000 complaints about pet food since the recall, as many as it usually gets in a two-year period on all topics combined. It has confirmed 16 deaths.“We have no good information what that final number might be,” Dr. Sundlof said. “It will take a while for us to get there.”The College of Veterinary Medicine at Iowa State University is investigating 43 suspected cases of pets that died from eating tainted food; the deaths of 18 are consistent with ingestion of a toxin, said Patrick Halbur, executive director of the Veterinary Diagnostic Lab at Iowa State.Dr. Halbur and Grant Maxie of the University of Guelph in Ontario, which is also investigating the cause of the illnesses and deaths, said it would probably take months to determine what made the pets sick.In Chicago, Senator Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, called for a hearing to question F.D.A. officials. He also called for standardized federal regulations and inspection requirements for pet food.'"

"'07-04-06,'0','WASHINGTON, April 5 — The owner of an Ohio nuclear plant has asked its insurer to pay for two years of lost production because of corrosion that it called “unexpected and unforeseeable,” even though it had resisted government pressure to inspect for acid leaks just before the problem was uncovered in 2002.The corrosion in the lid of the reactor vessel at the Davis-Besse nuclear plant near Toledo almost ate through the steel, leaving a hole the size of a football and nothing but a thin liner of stainless steel holding in the cooling water that surrounded the radioactive core.Before the plant’s owner, First Energy Nuclear Operating Company, discovered the problem during routine maintenance, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission had ordered inspections of reactors of that type to see if there was any damage around the vessel head. The company had petitioned for a delay, which the agency granted.In a report made public late Wednesday by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which was prepared as part of the company’s insurance claim, First Energy said the corrosion might have occurred over a matter of weeks. When the company was seeking permission to reopen its reactor, it told the commission that the corrosion had occurred over a period of three years.The company is seeking $80 million for replacement of the vessel head, and $106.7 million for the cost of replacement power. The plant was shut for two years, while technicians found a replacement head and installed it. The insurer, Nuclear Electric Insurance, a company with offices in Bermuda and Delaware, would not comment.'"
"'07-04-06,'0','The sentence evokes an image out of the Depression, of G-men in fedoras facing down the likes of Baby Face Nelson and Pretty Boy Floyd somewhere in the lawless Midwest.But fatal shootings of F.B.I. agents have been relatively rare — in the 1930s as well as today. Barry Lee Bush, the special agent shot dead yesterday near a highway in suburban New Jersey, was the 51st to die in the line of duty in the agency’s 99-year history.Mr. Bush was the first agent to be fatally shot on the job in 10 years. But from 1986 to 1996, nine agents were killed by gunfire, one more than in the 1930s.Still, there is something to the stereotype. Ronald Kessler, who wrote “The Bureau: The Secret History of the F.B.I.,” said that in the past, the F.B.I. made a point of chasing the kind of high-visibility cases that often had violent denouements.“The F.B.I. under J. Edgar Hoover went out of its way to publicize itself and trumpet its successes and its tragedies,” Mr. Kessler said. “They didn’t want to get involved in cases that were very complex.”'"
"'07-04-06,'0','“These dogs are highly trained herders,” said Donald Marcks, their owner. “Any dog could chase geese around the park and the geese would be scared — more because the dogs would be a nuisance than anything else.”But Mr. Marcks said that unlike other dogs, his collies would never harm the geese. In any case, the collies are kept under tight control by their human handlers.Mr. Marcks, who wore blue jeans, brown cowboy boots and a black cowboy hat that crowned a head of long blond-gray hair, resembled an aging rock star turned gentleman rancher. His handlebar mustache and goatee were perfectly trimmed.“All we’re doing is playing with several thousand years of predator-prey interaction,” he said, looking into a row of television cameras.Last week, before the Central Park Conservancy brought in Mr. Marcks and his company, Geese Police Inc., to rid the park of geese, 300 of the birds had made the park their home, a tenfold increase during the past three or four years, said Douglas Blonsky, president of the conservancy, a nonprofit organization that manages the park for the city.About 150 of the geese had been living in the park year round rather than migrating, as geese habitually do.But after three days of dog patrols this week, Mr. Blonsky said, the number of geese dwindled to about half a dozen. A team of four collies will be in the park for the rest of the month and will probably return in the fall, he said.Known for their ferocity when protecting their turf or their young, the park’s geese have been chasing ducks and other birds away, Mr. Blonsky said. They also have the potential to contribute to erosion and to the fouling of the lake by the sheer volume of their dung.The geese spend most of their time at Harlem Meer, which mimics their preferred habitat — a body of water surrounded by short grass. At night, they venture south to two of the park’s jewels: the Sheep Meadow and the Great Lawn. In those places, park officials take great pains to protect the grass, restricting large gatherings and most sporting activities. Mr. Blonsky said geese grazing and droppings could quickly overwhelm the grass.Parks officials said that before turning to the dogs, they tried a variety of options: education campaigns to stop people from feeding the geese; letting the grass grow taller to disrupt the birds’ eating habits; building fences to confuse them and try to limit access to certain areas.However, Mr. Blonsky said, “it was not enough to discourage the geese.”Border collies are used in such cases because they have been bred as herd animals and are able to frighten geese via “the stare,” a particular look and stance that leads geese to conclude that the dogs are predators, according to park officials.Sometimes the geese allow themselves to be corralled by the collies before flying off; at other times they fly away when they see the dogs coming. By contrast, geese quickly lose their fear of human scare tactics, like shouting and arm waving.Adrian Benepe, the city’s parks commissioner, said that so far no one had objected to the treatment of the geese.“The geese are not being hurt. They are being harassed the same way they harass animals that get in their way,” he said. “We haven’t had any complaints, but this is New York and it’s still early.”Several hours later, after the demonstration had ended and the dogs had gone, the geese had returned. In pairs, they ducked their heads into the water, eating aquatic plants, and soared above the Meer, honking noisily.'"
"'07-04-06,'0','The new campaign offers “more of a call to action,” said John Hayes, chief marketing officer at the American Express Company in New York.For example, the first television commercial shows the snowboarder Shaun White going online again and again to book flights at the last minute, using the points he has accrued with his American Express card.The reason for his frenetic travel is a skein of snowstorms that he follows from Utah to Canada to Japan to Norway. “Pay with points on any airline,” the spot declares. “Just click and fly.”Mr. White will also be featured on the American Express Web site (americanexpress.com). “I need to be able to travel where I want, when I want,” he will proclaim there.The specificity is in sharp contrast to the ethereal tenor of the “My life” campaign. Those ads featured celebrities like Robert De Niro, Ellen DeGeneres, the director M. Night Shyamalan and the surfer Laird Hamilton discussing their philosophies of living; Ms. DeGeneres also performed humorous skits with animals.The “My life” campaign “really wasn’t working,” said Robert K. Passikoff, president at Brand Keys, a research company in New York that studies brand and customer loyalty.In 1997, the American Express brand was first in the category of charge and credit cards in the Brand Keys customer loyalty index, Mr. Passikoff said, but fell in the 2007 survey to fifth, trailing (in order) Discover, Capital One, Visa and MasterCard.American Express “still has brand resonance,” Mr. Passikoff said, “but it has not been engaging consumer loyalty.”“Entertainment is not the same as engagement,” he added. “People looked at the Ellen DeGeneres commercials and said, ‘This is the funniest thing, so clever.’ And then they pulled out their Visa card.”Needless to say, executives at American Express take issue with that analysis. They provided data showing that the number of consumer cards in force last year, both in the United States and worldwide, increased from 2005, as did spending.“We do believe this brand is defined by the people who use and carry the card,” said Diego Scotti, global head of marketing at American Express, and the “My life” campaign “worked well in getting people to say, ‘I want to be part of this group,’ ” referring to the celebrities.“Now, we want to go into more depth about what you get out of membership,” Mr. Scotti said. “What has changed is the stories they tell will be connected to product, in an authentic way.”Mr. Hayes said that the “My life” campaign “has done a great job redefining the notion of membership” as well as reminding consumers that “American Express is a company, not just about transactions, but about relationships.”“We want now to include more and more prospects,” Mr. Hayes said, referring to potential cardholders, “and take ‘My life. My card’ to a broader audience.”That makes sense because credit card issuers, particularly MasterCard and Visa, are stepping up offers of rewards and perquisites. For example, a campaign for the Visa Signature credit card, aimed at upper-income consumers, promises it “takes you places regular rewards cards can’t, like a finish-line suite at Churchill Downs.”The arms race over rewards is intensifying because “high spenders are very profitable” for issuers of credit and charge cards, said Scott Henry, engagement manager at Fischer Jordan in New York, a consulting company.“We’re seeing rewards programs as the primary differentiator between issuers,” Mr. Henry said, which means that if “Visa is chasing after the more premium market, they have to add more perks like American Express has” — or vice versa.For some time, the marketing battle was centered on what Mr. Henry called “the earn rates and burn rates,” that is, how easy (or hard) it is to earn rewards and how easy (or hard) it is to redeem them.More recently, “experiential rewards are definitely something that are differentiating the rewards programs,” he added, referring to less-tangible perks like being taken backstage at a concert to meet the band or being assured of great seats for a hit Broadway show.The last time American Express replaced an ad theme so quickly was 15 years ago, in a change omitted from the chronology provided by the company.In November 1991, American Express replaced Ogilvy with a New York agency known as Chiat/Day/Mojo and dropped “Membership has its privileges” in favor of a theme that sounded as if James Bond had written it: “The card. The American Express card.”Eleven months later, Chiat/Day/Mojo was dismissed, the account was returned to Ogilvy and “Membership has its privileges” resumed its run.'"
"'07-04-06,'0','You conclude, “Before plunging ahead with an asteroid-deflector, let’s wait to see whether a real threat even exists.” I disagree. To wait until a threat is identified and certain is foolish, perhaps even suicidal.These events have happened and will continue to occur. An immediate effort to develop a way to deflect such objects must be undertaken.I believe that using a nuclear bomb would be foolish, although possibly effective. And the use of a nearby spacecraft for gravitation deflection would be too unsure.A more certain method would be to send a set of solid-fuel rocket motor devices, perhaps in a small “fleet,” and “land” them on the object. Once properly positioned, they could be ignited in a controlled manner to provide a consistent and constant “push” to alter the object’s path. Some scientists believe that this technology is already at hand.By having such devices ready, when an object is identified, we can act, and not lament. We can have the assurance of a future, rather than huddle helplessly in the face of doom.You say that Congress should add funds to the budget of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration for the asteroid hunt or that NASA should divert funds from less important projects.Why not bring this program under the United Nations banner so that the cost would be shared and the skills of scientists from every country could be used? It’s the world that’s at risk, not just the United States.'"
"'07-04-06,'0','Auctions on eBay may be adored by millions of consumers around the world, but the large cable television networks have decided they want nothing to do with them.Cable networks like Turner Networks, Discovery, Lifetime and ESPN have decided to boycott an online exchange designed by eBay to sell advertising time, the Cabletelevision Advertising Bureau, a trade group in New York, said today.Without the participation of cable networks, the eBay exchange will have no air time to sell to advertisers.“We don’t believe that eBay is going to get this right,” said Sean Cunningham, president and chief executive of the cable association.EBay was hired to build the exchange last year by a group of large marketers, including Hewlett-Packard, Home Depot and Philips Electronics. The group, which had pledged $50 million to test the project, has said it thought placing ads in many types of media could be done more efficiently using an Internet auction rather than human negotiation. Some advertising executives and television networks have been worried from the start that automated buying and selling would reduce prices and take creativity out of ad buying.The refusal of cable networks to participate in the exchange not only disrupts the eBay plans but also raises questions about how companies like Google will fare as they try to bring ad auctions that have worked online to traditional media like television and newspapers. Earlier this week, DoubleClick announced that it had created an online exchange for online ad sales that could be used in the future for offline ads, too.Seven national cable networks tested the exchange over the last month, and executives at those networks decided it went too far in removing humans from the ad sales process, Mr. Cunningham said.'"
"'07-04-06,'0','Elizabeth Ziff also had a transforming experience while on a yoga retreat. “I saw a whale breach about 50 feet away,” she recalled, “and that was it.” Last year Ms. Ziff, co-executive producer of “The L Word” on Showtime and a guitarist-vocalist with the band Betty, bought a one-room wooden house on a half-acre lot.“I love Puna because there are no resorts, and it has Hawaiian culture that hasn’t been utterly destroyed,” she said, speaking from her home in New York City (she also has a home in Vancouver). “I like the energy. I go there to heal.”But there is another, very grounded, reason to buy there: Price.“Puna is the cheapest real estate statewide,” said Denis Fuster, an agent with ReMax Island Surf Realty. While prices shot up more than 20 percent from 2005 to 2006, he said, the market has leveled. Buyers can still find plenty of acre plots in the $60,000 range, and the median price for a single-family dwelling was $269,000 at the end of 2006. Those figures attract people from the mainland, but also those who live on Hawaii’s pricier islands.“Although we do own a nice home on Oahu that we love, it’s getting a bit cramped, and traffic is often a problem,” said Michael Tatzber, a massage therapist who is in the process of buying a second home on the Big Island for $250,000 with his partner, Cassandra Holmes, a graphic designer. They also run Punaguide.com, a Web site that offers advice to potential buyers.“If you love peace and quiet and a natural environment,” Mr. Tatzber said, “then Puna is the place.”The village of Pahoa (population 1,037), a short strip that has a Wild West feel, is Puna’s downtown — the place to buy basics like natural groceries, sun block and gauzy skirts. On weekends, the handful of restaurants, especially Luqins Mexican Restaurant, buzz with the energy of people eager to connect.At a Sunday farmers’ market in Makuu, you can buy everything from local papayas and rambutans to organic honey to handmade surfboards.The activity is constant at Kehena Beach, where clothing is optional and people lounge in the black sand, watch for sea life and take part in Sunday drumming circles and parties. “There’s a certain earthy, artistic lifestyle in Puna, which attracts countercultural types,” said Liz Randol, a broker with Realty Executives Hawaii. Other activities include snorkeling in the warm Kapoho Tide Pools, soaking in a thermal (and slightly brackish) hot spring at Ahalanui Park and come nightfall, hiking across the field of lava that buried the fishing village of Kapalana in 1990. After about an hour and a half of hiking, you can see the glow of lava snaking to sea.“I love the densely tropical sense of this place,” said John Upton, 74, a photographer who lives mainly in Southern California but spends several months a year at his Puna home. Mr. Upton’s latest body of work focuses on the rich color palette of Hawaii’s tropical flora, which thrives in the moist, temperate climate.“The population here is also more stable, with less snowbirds than on the Kona side of the island,” said Heather Hedenschau, principal broker with Big Island Brokers.Because Puna has no resorts and a limited number of bed-and-breakfasts, homeowners can make extra money through vacation rentals. Robert Trickey, a San Francisco-based drapery designer and installer, said he had had no problem renting the guesthouse that sits next to his modern home, which is on a lava field and overlooks the ocean from the Puna Beach Palisades subdivision.“This subdivision is disproportionately gay,” said Mr. Trickey, who is gay and who laughed as he noted what may be another selling feature: The substantial gay and lesbian population here in the live-and-let-live jungle.Getting here — unless you live in Hawaii — is not quick or cheap. “It’s more expensive to fly here than to Europe,” said Joel Hall, 57, the head of a Chicago dance company who recently moved to Puna Palisades with his partner, Craig Davis, 50, a librarian. “But it’s worth it,” he added. The nearest airport is in Hilo, which has flights only to and from Oahu and Maui.Homeowners insurance is expensive, especially in the highest-risk lava-flow zones.Some here say the rural simplicity can leave you wanting more. “I’m a person who likes to go to exhibitions and art shows,” Mr. Upton said, “but there’s very little cultural life here.”Finally, there is a lot of new construction along Red Road, which hugs the shore. In addition to bringing tractors and piles of rubble, it has caused tension between the off-the-grid hippie crowd and the newer, moneyed vacation-home owners. “We all came here to get away from all this,” said Mayasa Clearwater, an 18-year resident who bemoaned the construction noise as she hitchhiked into Pahoa.Unless you plan to live off the grid in the jungle, you’ll be choosing lots or houses that are in one of the more than 30 subdivisions in Puna. They have breezy names like Seaview, Orchid Isle Estates and Hawaiian Paradise Park. Some have paved roads, and some dirt, and they vary in their nearness to the Pacific.There were 601 houses on the market in Puna at the end of last year, including a mix of plantation homes with large lanais, fixer-uppers from the 1960s and 1970s built with post-and-pier construction, and custom, top-of-the-line houses like Mr. Trickey’s.There are plenty of lots for sale — ranging from $30,000 to $60,000 for an acre that’s mauka (toward the mountain), and $100,000 or much higher for land that’s makai (toward the sea). Oceanfront parcels in Hawaiian Paradise Park have been priced as high as $568,000.A recent building boom created a glut. “There’s more inventory than there are buyers,” Ms. Hedenschau said. “So you can really find a nice, brand-new three-bedroom, two-bath house away from the ocean for $300,000.”On the low end, there are fixer-uppers and one-room cottages for as low as $150,000. The middle of the market has many places from $290,000 to $480,000; from there, prices can go as high as $1 million, even $2 million, for waterfront spreads.WHO’S BUYING Young professionals and retirees, mainly from the West Coast but also nationwide, who are looking for a natural, remote getaway at a good price.LOCATION In the southeast of the island of Hawaii, better known as the Big Island.GETTING THERE Flights from the mainland go direct to Kahului Airport on Maui, Honolulu International Airport on Oahu or Kona International Airport at Keahole on Hawaii. A short interisland flight will get you to Hilo International Airport, which is just north of Puna.WHILE YOU’RE LOOKING Your best bet is to rent someone’s vacation home. There are many listed on the Vacation Rentals by Owner Web site (www.vrbo.com). The Kalani Oceanside Retreat (12-6860 Kalapana-Kapoho Beach Road, 808-965-7828; www.kalani.com) has treehouses, cottages and lodge rooms for $105 to $260.'"

"'07-04-07,'0','Standing in front of a blank slate of white walls, three shivering swimmers, red-faced and half-smiling in tight suits, await their orders from a series of chillingly calm disembodied voices. “Show your thoughts!” “Bite your lip!” “Die!” Like obedient children, they do as they are told.Welcome to Aquaworld, a theme park where the temperature is always perfect and the beaches have no sand. You may think you’ve seen this place before in science fiction films or dystopian short stories by George Saunders, but don’t be too sure. All is not what it seems in “Five in the Morning,” a cerebral new brainteaser by the innovative London theater company Rotozaza that keeps you guessing throughout its taut, suspenseful 70 minutes. Are those scripted actors, or unrehearsed guests? Is Aquaworld a dream, or a voyage through a cracked subconscious? Are the swimmers merely puppets — and, if so, who pulls the strings?In the last few years, Rotozaza, which is making its American debut at P.S. 122, has earned notice in alternative theater circles with an experimental style that employs unscripted performers willing to follow instructions. A similar tactic was employed in last year’s puzzle play “An Oak Tree,” an English import, by Tim Crouch, analyzing issues of free will and power, but with less depth.Staged by Ant Hampton with the subtlety and sure-handedness of a seasoned magician, the play — written by Mr. Hampton, Silvia Mercuriali, Greg McLaren and Melanie Wilson — begins like a simple game of Simon Says (“Open your eyes,” “Touch her”) before a slight story starts to emerge. A surprisingly sweet romance develops between a man (Mr. McLaren) and the taller woman (Ms. Wilson). (No character names are given.) “Ask him if you can climb into his arms,” a voice instructs her. And she does. While everything seems rigidly controlled, moments of spontaneity — a smile, a roll of the eyes — occasionally break through, creating an almost transgressive tension that is oddly exciting.What saves “Five in the Morning” from being an abstract exercise is that it’s rooted in these characters — trapped, struggling neurotics brought to life with tenderness. The face of the pixieish Ms. Mercuriali, who plays the smaller woman, is a mask of anxiety. She stares into the audience yearningly, but it’s unclear if she can really see us. As the play progresses, the artifice of the theater becomes increasingly clear. Even the audience is occasionally drowned out by a laugh track.At its core, the play is about how we construct our own personas, piecing together a narrative that we play in our own minds. Explaining more would give away some of the surprises, which are essential to the delight of the show. As with a great suspense film, watching this unusually daring show provides the gradual recognition of being manipulated — and enjoying every second of it.'"

"'07-04-07,'0','Russia will convert its Pacific fleet into its biggest naval force to meet security threats in Asia, said Sergei B. Ivanov, the defense minister who was promoted to first deputy prime minister this year. He said Russia’s Northern fleet was its strongest during the Cold War but asked, “Now, who are we going to fight there?” Relations with NATO are not bad, Russian news agencies quoted him as saying during a trip to Khabarovsk in Russia’s Far East, “but here the risks are greater.” Of Russia’s four fleets, three — the Black Sea, Northern and Baltic fleets — are designed to cope with Western threats. But the Pacific fleet lacks any of the system of agreements and mechanisms intended to keep peace in Europe, Mr. Ivanov said. “This is a region where there is a risk of conflict,” he said. “Here you have the United States, China, Korea and Japan, and there are absolutely no rules of the game.”'"
"'07-04-07,'0','“We’re all going to run out of patience at some point, and that’s going to be sooner rather than later,” said Susan C. Schwab, the United States trade representative, in a speech on Feb. 22.Bloomberg News, citing industry executives who said they had been briefed by the administration, said Ms. Schwab was likely to file two complaints against China as early as next week.Sean Spicer, a spokesman for the trade representative, refused to comment on administration plans. But industry executives have been expecting a formal complaint.“It’s a sign of growing impatience, including within the business community,” said William A. Reinsch, president of the National Council on Foreign Trade, an association that represents companies on international trade issues.Industry executives said they had been waiting for the Bush administration to file two separate complaints. One addresses what American companies say is China’s reluctance to use criminal laws for people caught selling DVDs with pirated material on them.A second complaint would be about expanding “market access” for American products in China.If the United States files the twin actions, it would be the third time this year that the Bush administration has sought to pressure China for its trade practices, signaling a tougher policy after taking a largely conciliatory approach for six years.On March 30, the United States announced it would reverse more than 20 years of practice and impose potentially steep tariffs on Chinese manufactured goods on the ground that China is illegally subsidizing some of its exports.In February, the administration leveled a complaint with the world trade group that China subsidizes a number of industries in violation of trade rules.The growing American trade deficit with China, which reached a record $232.5 billion last year, has been denounced by Democrats as the cause of hundreds of thousands of lost jobs. Many Democrats elected last fall campaigned for a tougher policy on trade with China, and Democrats have threatened to pass legislation to retaliate. Any new legal actions against China over intellectual property could be an effort to preempt those.Chinese authorities have made moves in recent days to head off a legal confrontation. On March 26, China’s National Anti-Piracy and Pornography Office announced that it had raided a storage facility in Guangzhou, after receiving information from the Motion Picture Association, and seized what it said were about 1.6 million pirated copies of movies and television shows.This week, the Chinese Embassy in Washington announced that China’s Supreme Court had issued a “new judicial interpretation” that would lower the threshold under which prosecutors are allowed to charge people under criminal laws against piracy.Until this week, prosecutors could impose administrative penalties only on people caught with fewer than 1,000 illegal DVDs. Now the threshold will be just 500 DVDsBut those moves are not enough to satisfy the movie industry or the recording industry. Nor are they likely in themselves to make a serious dent in the open sales of bootlegged music and software. In big cities like Shanghai, vendors sell pirated goods along major thoroughfares like the Nanjing Road as well as along bridges, small roads and alleyways.Dan Glickman, president of the Motion Picture Association of America, told a Congressional hearing in February that movie producers were worried that pirated copies of American movies would not only lead to lost sales in China but be exported around the world and even back to the United States.“We have walked a long way down the China road, looking and hoping for improvement,” Mr. Glickman testified. “We may be nearing the end of that course and deciding on whether to take another.”The broader issue is how China reacts to any legal complaint that the United States might bring. It is unclear whether the W.T.O. would agree with the United States, and it is even less clear what kind of punishments it would allow even if it did rule against China.If the new complaints are filed, under the trade organization’s rules, the United States would formally ask for “consultations” with China. After 60 days, it would be allowed to ask for an independent panel of the World Trade Organization to consider the dispute. That process often takes years to complete.'"
"'07-04-07,'0','Mr. Herrera-Genao was the fourth man arrested over 20 hours in connection with the string of recent bank robberies; the authorities said yesterday that they were still looking for at least two other members associated with the group. The F.B.I. agent in charge of the investigation, Carrie Brzenzinski, described the suspects as “tough guys — wanting the thrill.”“A statement was overheard that they were prepared to go down in a blaze of glory,” said Ms. Brzenzinski, who has been tracking bank robbers in New Jersey for 16 years. “This was a rush for them. This was their thing, and they were getting away with it.”The charges filed against the three suspects in Thursday’s attempted robbery — Mr. Herrera-Genao, Wilfredo Berrios, 28, and Michael Cruz, 21 — may be amended to include murder and assault on a federal officer in connection with the death of the F.B.I. agent, Barry Lee Bush, 52.A fourth man, Efrain Lynn, 21, was not present at the confrontation at the bank on Thursday but was arrested at another location later in the day in connection with a March 16 holdup of a Bank of America branch in South Brunswick. The four lived within blocks of one another in a New Brunswick neighborhood near Rutgers University.Pedro Ruiz, the acting special agent in charge of the Newark F.B.I. office, refused to provide any details yesterday on how Mr. Bush was shot or which other agents were involved; the matter is being investigated by the F.B.I.’s Washington-based inspection division, in a process that the authorities said could take months.Col. Joseph R. Fuentes, superintendent of the New Jersey State Police, said that after hunting all night for Mr. Herrera-Genao, whom they believed to be armed and dangerous, officers began searching the area around the motel about 7:30 a.m. because a woman living nearby alerted the police that a “muddy man” had tried to carjack her.Colonel Fuentes said that investigators were trying to piece together where Mr. Herrera-Genao had been during the night, what had become of much of his clothing and whether he was linked to several break-ins reported in the rural area even as scores of law enforcement officers were searching for him.“I just look at the environment he was in — temperatures in the low 30s, high 20s — and he was missing much of his clothing,” Colonel Fuentes said. “He was covered with leaves and twigs and very muddy and showed evidence of being in the weeds or water.”Among the items found on Thursday in the two cars used by the suspects, according to a criminal complaint filed by federal prosecutors, were an AK-47 assault rifle, an SKS rifle and a .380-caliber handgun, all of them loaded, as well as two ski masks.While it is common for bank robbers to carry guns, Ms. Brzenzinski said, the crew was unusual because it routinely fired weapons, if only to establish control. In three of the four robberies attributed to the group, according to the criminal complaint, recovered bullets and shell casings were found to have come from a .380-caliber handgun.“Also, in three of the robberies, assault rifles were brandished,” the complaint says. “Two individuals were injured by ricocheting bullets and several individuals were held at close gunpoint.”In the first robbery attributed to the crew, at a Piscataway bank on Feb. 8, Ms. Brzenzinski said that Mr. Herrera-Genao fired a shot and jumped up on the wall separating the tellers from the gunmen before pulling down his ski mask and gathering $9,000 from the tellers’ drawers in a matter of minutes.On Feb. 16, the robbers struck again, in East Brunswick, and this time a suspect had his ski mask on as he walked through the door and fired a shot, Ms. Brzenzinski said. After vaulting the tellers’ partition, the man and a masked accomplice stationed at the door escaped with $28,000.In the third robbery, on March 2 in Ocean Township, a gunman believed to be Mr. Herrera-Genao fired while leaping over the tellers’ partition. It was also that robbery, in which the gunmen took $16,000, that gave the F.B.I. a crucial break in the case.Investigators already knew that the crew favored Hondas as getaway cars, typically stealing them the day of the robbery or the day before, then dumping them in favor of a second vehicle of a different model and color, known as a “switch car.” After the March 2 robbery, Ms. Brzenzinski said, the authorities recovered a Honda in a shopping center parking lot that matched the description of the getaway car, and while canvassing the area turned up a description and license plate number of what seemed to be the switch car.Tracing that tag led investigators to a rental agency. According to the criminal complaint, “Video surveillance tapes from the rental agency revealed that defendant Francisco Herrera accompanied defendant Wilfredo Berrios when the latter rented the vehicle.” Surveillance then began in earnest.For the March 16 robbery in South Brunswick, the crew added a fourth person to wait in the getaway car, Ms. Brzenzinski said. Otherwise, she said, the methods, and even the words spoken, were always the same: “Everyone down. Give me your money. Big bills.”In reference to the March 16 robbery in South Brunswick, another complaint says, “One gunman wearing a dark hooded sweatshirt, jeans and a ski mask jumped onto the teller ledge and fired one round from a .380 handgun into the wall.” The bullet broke the teller window and injured a teller, who was taken to the hospital, the document says.On Wednesday, according to investigators, Mr. Cruz bought .380-caliber ammunition at a store in New Jersey. Early the next morning, the authorities put Mr. Berrios under surveillance.A law enforcement official who had been briefed on the events leading up to the shooting on Thursday and spoke on the condition of anonymity because the investigation was continuing, said the bank robbers were “a shifting crew.”“Not every robbery is done by everyone in the crew,” the official said. “Sometimes it’s three or four guys and sometimes some of these guys, but not others. And they were also hitting at a fairly regular pace.”The official added, “They had these guys under surveillance, and they observed them steal a car or saw them come back with a stolen car, and as of Wednesday night, it looked like they had taken the steps they take for a robbery on Thursday or Friday.” The previous four robberies all took place on Thursdays or Fridays.Because the robbers had been operating with heavy weapons and an escalating level of violence, members of the task force investigating the holdups had decided they would not wait for the men to enter the bank, the official said.“So the conscious decision was made that if we have them going up to a bank, we’re going to make every effort to get them before” they go inside, the official said, adding, “The determination is if they take us to a bank, we’re going to take them down outside.”According to the criminal complaint, F.B.I. agents approached the white Acura on Thursday morning outside the PNC Bank to arrest those inside.“Shots were fired at this time, and a special agent of the F.B.I. was shot and subsequently died,” the document said. “The individual inside the Acura was defendant Michael Cruz,” it continued, saying that Mr. Cruz “subsequently made statements admitting to his participation in the attempted robbery of the PNC Bank.”A separate criminal complaint against Mr. Lynn said that Mr. Cruz, since his arrest, had also admitted to participating in the March 16 robbery and was responsible for driving the switch car that day.The document also quotes Mr. Cruz as implicating Mr. Herrera-Genao, Mr. Berrios and Mr. Lynn in the March 16 robbery.As for Mr. Herrera-Genao, Matthew McCurry, a detective with the state police, said that he had tried to break into a woman’s Hyundai Elantra yesterday morning as she drove in a neighborhood adjacent to the Fox Hollow Golf Club, near Route 22. The woman, whose doors were locked, drove to a business on Route 22, where she called the police.Soon after, officers from numerous agencies responded, using dogs to catch Mr. Herrera-Genao in the woods behind the inn.The searchers — hundreds of them from the state police, the F.B.I., the United States Marshals Service and several town police forces — set up a loose perimeter and moved inward, focusing on the neighborhood next to the golf club, where they conducted a house-to-house search.Mr. McCurry said state police helicopters used infrared to search for heat sources, hoping for a human, but instead detecting only wildlife.“We ended up finding a turkey roosting in a pine tree,” he said.'"
"'07-04-07,'0','One reason is public pressure, said Steve Sturm, group vice president for Toyota in North America. “Look at how many people went to see Al Gore’s movie,” Mr. Sturm said, referring to “An Inconvenient Truth.”Environmental issues are “in the news every week,” Mr. Sturm added. “It keeps getting major headlines.”Exhaust emissions from the tailpipes of cars and trucks account for about a fifth of the country’s total emissions of heat-trapping gases.“People get it now,” said David Doniger, a lawyer and climate center policy director of the Natural Resources Defense Council. “They didn’t pay much attention to global warming five years ago.”Another crucial factor is the move by both Congress and the Bush administration for action on fuel economy. Lawmakers have introduced bills calling for raising the fuel economy standard, called the corporate average fuel economy, to as high as 40 miles a gallon, compared with the current 27.5 miles a gallon for cars and 24 miles a gallon for light trucks.The administration’s proposal, part of a collection of steps it wants to see taken on the environment, would call for more modest increases of about one mile a gallon per year over the next few years.No matter what is instituted, however, carmakers are getting the message that fuel economy is going to go up as part of the fight against global warming, even if government action is still several years away.Given that, carmakers said at the New York show that they want to be included in the dialogue, not shunted aside because of their past resistance.“We very much want to work with Congress,” said Derrick M. Kuzak, group vice president for global product development at the Ford Motor Company, echoing the official stance of the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, an industry trade group.Mr. Kuzak went on, “We recognize that CO2 is an issue and we want to be part of the solution, but it has to be technology-based, and affordable.”Mr. Doniger said, “They’re coming to the table so they can avoid being on the menu.”Indeed, Mr. Kuzak said the worst thing Congress or the administration could do would be to make changes that would force consumers to change their buying habits and “force us to include expensive technology” that buyers are not willing to pay for. Even so, small cars outsold sport utility vehicles last year and analysts expect S.U.V. sales to continue to decline.The technology that would be required to fight automotive emissions could raise the cost of many vehicles by more than $5,000, said Robert A. Lutz, vice chairman at General Motors. Rebates and other incentives have made buyers resistant to price increases, so the struggling automakers would have to absorb the expense.“This technology does not come for free,” he told reporters at the auto show. “Anybody who thinks that the auto industry will invent some sort of device that will eliminate or absorb CO2 is dreaming.”Even so, for the last year G.M. has promoted the vehicles in its lineup that achieve 30 miles to the gallon. At the show this week, G.M. took that focus a step further. It showed off three tiny concept cars, the Trax, Beat and Groove, which could represent a future minicar to be sold by Chevrolet. The company is asking visitors to visit a Web site, www.vote4chevrolet.com, to choose their favorite among the three, which it could then put in production.Still, the carmakers are squaring off against states and environmentalists outside Washington. Eleven states have adopted the emissions regulations created by California, which are meant to cut emissions from cars and light trucks by 25 percent and from sport utility vehicles by 18 percent, beginning in 2009.Automakers have jointly filed suit against the regulations in California and will go to court in Vermont next week, in an effort to block the measures from being enacted there. The automakers say they would have to close dealerships and limit the number of big vehicles they sell in Vermont and elsewhere if the regulations take effect.Toyota, which has sold more than 500,000 hybrid-electric vehicles in the United States this decade, still has found itself a target of environmentalists because it has broadened its range to include big vehicles like the new version of the Tundra pickup.On Wednesday, two protestors from the environmental group Freedom From Oil were arrested after they unfurled a 20-foot banner at the entrance to the Javits Center. Borrowing from Toyota’s advertising slogan, the banner read, “Toyota: The Truck That’s Changing the Climate.”The protest took place a day after Toyota said that it sold a record number of Prius hybrid cars during March, thanks in part to an advertising campaign coupled with special lease deals.“Building Priuses does not give Toyota license to mass-produce the Tundra,” said Sarah Connolly, the co-director of the Freedom From Oil campaign.Mr. Sturm said he did not see any conflict between the vehicles. The Prius allows Toyota “to be noticed as an environmentally sensitive company,” he said, while Tundra puts Toyota in the big-truck market “where everyone plays.”Indeed, Mr. Kuzak at Ford agreed that it would be variety, not a single approach that is needed to address the fuel economy issue. He said Ford was looking at several strategies. .“It is not simply power train technology, it is not simply downsizing vehicles,” said Mr. Kuzak, whose company showed off a new crossover vehicle called the Flex as well as a big Ford Expedition customized by the hip-hop disc jockey Funkmaster Flex.“All those technologies will get us to where we need to be as an industry,” Mr. Kuzak said.'"
"'07-04-07,'0','WASHINGTON, April 6 — Senator John McCain has issued an apology of sorts for his remarks after visiting a Baghdad market last weekend, saying he misspoke when he declared that his ability to walk freely around the marketplace was a sign of a significant improvement in security in Iraq.He led a Congressional delegation through the Shorja market under tight security, with 100 heavily armed American troops guarding the group and attack helicopters and snipers watching over them. Mr. McCain, Republican of Arizona, and another member of the delegation, Representative Mike Pence, Republican of Indiana, said the conditions showed that the decision to deploy more than 20,000 additional American forces to Iraq was having the intended effect.Baghdad residents expressed astonishment at Mr. McCain’s rosy remarks, saying that he visited the marketplace, the scene of numerous deadly bombings, under unrealistic conditions. Democrats and antiwar bloggers ridiculed him for blindly supporting the administration’s so-called surge policy.Mr. McCain, in an interview to be broadcast on CBS News’ “60 Minutes” on Sunday, acknowledged that his critics were right. “Of course I am going to misspeak and I’ve done it on numerous occasions and I probably will do it in the future. I regret that when I divert attention to something I said from my message, but you know, that’s just life.”On Feb. 28 on the “Late Show With David Letterman,” Mr. McCain criticized President Bush’s management of the war, saying, “We’ve wasted a lot of our most precious treasure, which is American lives, over there.” He apologized the next day for the word “wasted,” saying he should have said “sacrificed.”'"
"'07-04-07,'0','In public comments this week, Mr. McConnell described the job in terms that made it sound like one part green eyeshade accountant and another part hall monitor: dictating the budgets of the 16 intelligence agencies and “ensuring that no one breaks the law.”He complained that he lacked the authority to hire and fire members of the staff he nominally leads, as most intelligence employees actually report to cabinet officials other than him.Mr. McConnell, 63, who brought a decade of experience as a management consultant to his current job, euphemistically called this situation a “challenging management condition.”He even grumbled a bit about his long hours, describing a workday that sometimes begins at 4 a.m. to prepare for the president’s intelligence briefing and often does not end until 11 p.m.“My biggest challenge early is just stamina,” he said.Officials said that having a deputy in place could lighten the work burden, but that the White House had rejected a handful of possible candidates submitted by Mr. McConnell this year.Gordon D. Johndroe, a White House spokesman, declined to comment, saying the White House did not discuss personnel matters before candidates were nominated by the president.Mr. McConnell hinted this week that he was working on a list of proposed changes he could take to the president that could improve some of the structural problems he was encountering, saying that in his opinion “we need to adjust.”Chad Kolton, a spokesman for the director of national intelligence, said that Mr. McConnell was “taking a very careful look at the authorities that the D.N.I. has,” but that he was not ready to take any recommendations to the president.Amy Zegart, an intelligence expert and an associate professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, said the office of the director of national intelligence, originally intended to be a lean organization that could ride herd over an often dysfunctional intelligence community, had ballooned into an apparatus of more than 1,500 people that had merely added another layer to an unwieldy bureaucracy.But Ms. Zegart praised Mr. McConnell as trying to overhaul the organization he inherited.“The good news is that McConnell is aware and very candid about the problems he’s finding on the job,” she said.Officials said that some of the problems had been created by the often tense working relationship between John D. Negroponte, Mr. McConnell’s predecessor, and former Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld, who long resisted ceding the Pentagon’s control over a large part of the intelligence budget to the new spy czar.“The relationship between Negroponte and Rumsfeld was formal at best, and it’s no secret that Rumsfeld was never a proponent of this approach to intelligence reform,” a senior intelligence official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. “This slowed down the process of moving on some very fundamental reforms.”One change Mr. Rumsfeld resisted was lending military intelligence personnel to civilian agencies and making stints at a number of difference agencies a requirement for promotion.But Mr. McConnell and Robert M. Gates, Mr. Rumsfeld’s successor at the Pentagon, have a friendship going back several years, and officials said Mr. Gates was far less territorial about allowing military personnel to be farmed out to other agencies.Mr. Gates himself is a former director of central intelligence, and intelligence experts said they were optimistic that he and Mr. McConnell, along with General Hayden at the C.I.A., were the right people to fix the problems of an intelligence structure that nearly everyone agrees is less than perfect.“These guys are the A-team,” said Mark M. Lowenthal, an assistant director of the C.I.A. from 2002 to 2005. “If they can’t make this thing work, then it’s hopeless.”'"
"'07-04-07,'0','The Food and Drug Administration yesterday ordered drug companies to stop making and selling anti-nausea suppositories containing a drug that the agency said did not work when used in that form.The move was part of a campaign by the agency to re-evaluate drugs approved before 1962, the year drug makers had to start proving that their products worked. Before 1962, they had to prove only that they did no harm.The suppositories, sold by prescription under the names Tigan, Tebamide, T-Gen, Trimazide and Trimethobenz, all contain the active ingredient trimethobenzamide.About two million such suppositories are sold each year, said Dr. Jason Woo, an official in the agency’s compliance office.Trimethobenzamide in other forms, including pills and injectables, does have F.D.A. approval for use against nausea and vomiting, the agency said.'"
"'07-04-07,'0','The fire comes at a sensitive time for the plant. The owners are seeking to extend the 40-year licenses on the two operating reactors by 20 years, over the opposition of the Westchester County executive, Andrew J. Spano. They are also seeking to find and stop at least two leaks from spent fuel pools, which are allowing radioactive water to seep into the soil and, presumably, into the Hudson River. The plant is already subject to extra inspections because of the groundwater pollution.The commission acted on Friday because it was the plant’s fourth shutdown since last July 1. The national average is fewer than one unplanned shutdown per reactor per year. “We’re going to get rigorously attacked by our opponents,” Mr. Steets said.In fact, Susan Tolchin, Mr. Spano’s chief adviser, said that while the fire did not pose an immediate threat, in light of the plant’s recent operating history, “this is a cause for concern for us.” At a news conference, she also referred to the failure of the alarm sirens to work in a recent test. (The event on Friday was not serious enough to merit their use.) She said that the shutdowns, the sirens and the age of the plants, both of which entered service in the 1970s, “are all reasons why County Executive Spano wants to see the plant shut down.”Studies have shown, though, that building a replacement plant and reducing demand through efficiency would be difficult and costly. In addition, New York State has joined a pact with neighboring states to reduce global warming gases from power generation, which would be much more difficult if the reactors were shut.The other operable reactor, Indian Point 2, has had three unplanned shutdowns in the last 12 months.The Nuclear Regulatory Commission ranks reactors according to 16 “performance indicators,” and both Indian Point plants had been “green,” the highest grade, in all of them, until the fire. But in the category of unplanned shutdowns per 7,000 hours of operation, Indian Point 3’s grade is now “white,” the second-highest. The other categories are yellow and red.Seven thousand is the approximate number of hours that a well-run reactor will operate in a year. As the federal regulators have demanded improved performance, the threshold for sending in extra inspectors has declined, so that a single “indicator” below the top grade is now sufficient to do so.To maximize the number of hours it runs, the owners have switched Indian Point 3 to an every-other-year refueling system, and finished a refueling shutdown in record time, 24 days, on March 31. But it shut down again on April 3, before it could reach full power. In the predawn hours, it developed a problem in a pump that delivers clean, nonradioactive water to its steam generators, for heating into steam.On Friday it was still ramping up to full power when the fire hit. The company declared an “unusual event,” the lowest category in a four-level ranking of emergencies, at 11:43 a.m. The event was declared over about an hour later, but the fire was out before the event declaration; Mr. Steets said the operators took a few minutes to decide whether there had been an explosion, which would have moved the incident into the category of unusual event. Being unable to make a conclusive determination, they went ahead and declared the event.In Rockland County, C. J. Miller, a spokeswoman for the county executive, said that residents of Stony Point had called their local police to report smoke at 11:09 a.m., but that the county did not have any information from Entergy until an e-mail message at 11:36, and then a phone call 20 minutes after that. “There is a repeated lag,” she said, in what information is disseminated “and when and to whom. If something happens, we need to act quickly.”Last July, an electrical flaw in the generator caused the plant to shut down. Then workers put metal scaffolding too close to electrical equipment and observed electric arcing, so the plant was shut. A focus of the enhanced inspection will be to see if there are any physical issues or management issues that link the shutdowns.'"
"'07-04-07,'0','Hynix Semiconductor, the world’s second-largest computer memory chip maker, has won a dismissal of claims by Sun Microsystems that it conspired to drive up memory chip prices, overcharging chip buyers.Judge Phyllis Hamilton of Federal District Court in San Francisco said in a ruling issued late Thursday that Sun, the server computer maker, had failed to specify in its complaint whether its chip purchases occurred in the United States or abroad and did not provide other details about where the harm to the company occurred.The complaint “fails to provide fair notice of the entire basis — i.e. foreign harm versus domestic harm — for plaintiff’s claims,” Judge Hamilton said in the ruling. She gave Sun and the Unisys Corporation, which also sued, until May 4 to file an amended complaint.Sun and Unisys sued Hynix and several other chip makers in September, accusing of antitrust violations and unfair business practices. They said they were overcharged for dynamic random access memory, or DRAM, chips, the memory component in computers and other electronic devices. DRAM makers have faced similar claims by the Justice Department, state governments and other DRAM purchasers.A spokeswoman for Sun, Kathy Engle, did not respond to a message left after hours.In May 2005, Hynix pleaded guilty to price-fixing claims and was ordered to pay a $185 million fine.A Hynix senior vice president for memory sales and marketing was accused in an indictment in October of participating in a global conspiracy to fix DRAM prices.The settlement and indictment were part of a federal investigation into price fixing in the chip market that has led to claims against 4 companies and 16 individuals who have been fined $731 million, the federal government said.'"
"'07-04-07,'0','Olcott Hawthorne Deming, a career Foreign Service officer and the first American ambassador to Uganda after it gained independence from Britain in 1962, died on March 20 near his home in Washington. He was 98.The death was confirmed by his son Rust Deming.Mr. Deming was appointed ambassador to Uganda by President John F. Kennedy in January 1963; at the time, he was the American consul general in Kampala, the capital.“He went there with the idea that Africa had the opportunity to develop functioning democracies,” said Rust Deming, who was ambassador to Tunisia from 2000 to 2003. “But during his three-plus years there, my father became quite discouraged because of the tribalism that emerged within Uganda and the breakdown of economic cooperation between Uganda, Kenya and what was then Tanganyika,” now Tanzania.Born in Westchester County, N.Y., on Feb. 28, 1909, Mr. Deming was one of seven children of William Champion Deming, a physician, and the former Imogen Hawthorne. (He was a great-grandson of the author Nathaniel Hawthorne.) The family later moved to Redding, Conn.Besides his son Rust, of Bethesda, Md., Mr. Deming is survived by another son, John, of Washington; a daughter, Rosamond Deming of Madrid; a sister, Joan Ensor of Redding; three granddaughters; and five great-grandchildren. His wife of 38 years, the former Louise Macpherson, died in 1976.Mr. Deming graduated from Rollins College in Winter Park, Fla., in 1935. For several years, he taught at private schools in Greenwich, Conn. But in 1942 he was hired to work in the Office of Inter-American Affairs at the State Department. He entered the Foreign Service in 1948 and from 1951 to 1959 was a public affairs officer in Thailand and then Japan. In 1959, he was named director of the Office of East and South African Affairs.'"
"'07-04-07,'0','It was Mick Barr’s night. On stage Wednesday at Studio B in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, he stood with his electric guitar, eaves of long hair falling on either side of his face, nodding at his work. His piece — it was only one piece — started with one repeated loud staccato note, played with a pick ad infinitum as a seemingly endless dexterity drill.This was Ocrilim, Mr. Barr’s latest project for solo electric guitar. What he was doing here relates to what he does in his guitar-drums duos Orthrelm and Hella. After 20 seconds came the first hurdle for the brain: this note isn’t going to change, is it? Of course it did, but not until it started to sound different, until you weren’t hearing just the pitch of the note but also the shape and snap of it, and the whupa-whupa-whupa made by hand, pick, string and the pickup of his Gibson SG. It sounded like something. Like what? Oh, yeah, helicopter blades rotating.Then, intermittently, a short, snaky chromatic figure worked itself into the long strings of single notes. And again, this time reordered, almost sounding as if the notes were played in reverse order. And finally the one-note wall gave way to wider, developing figures, but still at that same tempo of the whupa-whupa-whupa. What Mr. Barr is up to could be the solitary-artist extension of death metal; it also could be the rock extension of Coltrane’s “Interstellar Space.” What Mr. Barr doesn’t stop at, thankfully, is minimalism. He used mesmerizing repetition, definitely, for stretches. The piece lasted about 45 minutes, routing through gently bent bar chords and long, finger-busting episodes where his fretting hand stayed in one position but the fingers jumped like popcorn. But as the song grew it developed along clean lines of Western harmony, in ways that finally complimented the brain for what it knew, rather than stumping it by what it didn’t understand. The music didn’t retreat into itself; it was exciting.Black Dice, the 10-year-old Brooklyn trio that headlined the show, wasn’t on its best game. Concept-slingers as much as musicians, they’ve gone from broken, thrashing aggression to amiable droning, and now into something much more earnestly rhythmic, or polyrhythmic. But at any given time, the band’s music hasn’t stayed in one place, and it never reduces easily. All non-notated music benefits from little discrepancies of phrasing and groove between players: this creates tension and promotes the human touch. But Black Dice’s rhythmic discrepancies, as its members layered the rhythms with squelching keyboard noises and guitar notes, were so big that sometimes you couldn’t tell what they were intending — whether they wanted their rhythms so off-centered or not.It definitely wasn’t the night for No Age, which opened the show, even though there’s a clever pop band inside the sawed-off racket of these two guys from Los Angeles, Randy Randall and Dean Spunt. Mr. Spunt is an awkward drummer; Mr. Randall is a less awkward guitarist. Their songs begin artlessly, as if heading nowhere fast, only to become bigger than you might have expected, with the activation of a digital pedal or a new riff. But on Wednesday they just weren’t making friends with their materials. They used minidiscs to create extra sound layers, and the discs weren’t working. The kick drum got pushed out from Mr. Spunt’s heavy thumping, and he kicked it over, continuing without it for a while. The crash cymbal kept falling over. “I feel like this is way too uncalled-for-ly sloppy,” Mr. Randall said. And he was right. After about 15 minutes, they just gave up.'"
"'07-04-07,'0','It currently has two; one of them, the CREF Social Choice Account, is the largest socially responsible investing vehicle in the country, with $9 billion in assets. And it clearly plans to do more. A few weeks ago, TIAA-CREF came out with an updated policy statement on corporate governance that stressed its desire to “engage with companies on governance, environmental, social and performance issues.” One of its executives, John Wilcox, does nothing but manage the firm’s work in this area.Indeed, after the meeting, Mr. Wilcox approached Mr. Keady, and they huddled for about 10 minutes. Mr. Wilcox listened respectfully, and offered to meet with Mr. Keady for a longer discussion.But then I spoke to Mr. Wilcox, and discovered something that surprised me. Nike, which had been kicked out of TIAA-CREF’s socially responsible funds back when it was first engulfed in controversy over the treatment of workers in overseas factories, was reinstated in the summer of 2005. Which means that TIAA-CREF had come to the view that Nike had earned the right to rejoin the ranks of socially responsible companies. But what, exactly, was that judgment based on?I should concede right here that I’ve always harbored some suspicion about socially responsible investing. The longstanding complaint from skeptics is that it forces investors to accept lower returns — because lots of rising stocks are excluded — for dubious social good. But performance isn’t really the problem. A number of socially screened mutual funds have done just fine, and the benchmark Domini 400 index, which is made up entirely of companies viewed as socially responsible, has actually outperformed the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index over the course of its 16-year existence. Besides, most mainstream mutual fund managers don’t consistently beat the market, so why should socially responsible fund managers be held to a higher standard?No, my problem is that socially responsible investing oversimplifies the world, and in so doing distorts reality. It allows investors to believe that their money is only being invested in “good companies,” and they take foolish comfort in that belief. Rare is the company, after all, that is either all good or all bad. To put it another way, socially responsible investing creates the illusion that the world is black and white, when its real color is gray.Take oil companies. It’s fair to say that the socially responsible crowd has no use for energy companies. For years, the only oil company such funds would even consider was BP, because of its early warnings about global warming and its embrace of environmental values. But in 2005, a BP refinery in Texas had a major explosion, killing 15 workers and injuring more than 100 others. And last year, the company spilled oil in the North Slope of Alaska. The world woke up to the fact that BP had a pretty shoddy safety and maintenance record.At the other extreme is Exxon Mobil, a company many socially responsible investors detest, because of its longstanding (and recently abandoned) reluctance to embrace the global warming consensus. Yet Exxon has a terrific worker safety record, and it hasn’t had a serious oil spill since the Exxon Valdez in 1989. So which is the “real” good company here? You can probably guess which way I’d vote.The Nike case offers, I think, an even better illustration of the underlying contradictions of socially responsible investing. It turns out that the reason TIAA-CREF put Nike’s stock back in its socially responsible portfolio is that a company in Boston, KLD Research & Analytics, had given Nike its seal of approval. KLD is a small firm that constructs socially responsible indexes, including the Domini 400. Its 40-member staff includes about two dozen researchers who supposedly dig into companies and decide which should be included in its indexes — and which should be excluded. Its biggest index, the KLD Broad Market Social Index, uses the Russell 3000 as its universe, which it has whittled down to 2,050 companies it deems acceptable.TIAA-CREF is a client of KLD. That means that in addition to licensing the KLD Broad Market Social Index and KLD’s research products, the larger firm accepts KLD as its ultimate arbiter of which companies are socially responsible. Indeed, the prospectus for TIAA-CREF’s socially responsible equity fund specifically states that its criteria for choosing companies are based on the KLD broad market index.Thus, last year, when KLD decided to toss Coca-Cola out of its indexes — for reasons including “controversies over how they market the product to schools,” according to Eric Fernald, KLD’s research director — TIAA-CREF automatically followed suit. (I should point out that this applies only to TIAA-CREF’s socially responsible funds, not its other investment products.) Although not every one of its clients accepts KLD’s word as gospel, the firm’s screening methodology is widely accepted among socially responsible fund managers, and it consequently has a great deal of sway.I spent a lot of time this week talking to people at KLD, including its co-founder and president, Peter Kinder. They are smart and likeable, and their heart is in the right place. But I came away thinking that that sway was undeserved.Consider, first, the size of the place. Two dozen researchers are monitoring 3,000 companies — and writing in-depth reports? How is that even possible? It’s not. Mr. Kinder told me that the employees almost never go abroad to do on-site inspections, but rely on media reports, blogs, interactions with activist organizations and conversations with the company itself. That hardly seems like enough to make a decision on whether a company is good or bad.Then there’s the question of how KLD goes about reaching its conclusions. Nike’s relationship with its manufacturers abroad was first brought to light by activists in the 1990s, who wanted to find a big brand that captured people’s attention. As the largest seller of athletic shoes in the world, Nike was the obvious target. But Nike was using the same factories as Reebok and other shoe manufacturers, including Timberland, a darling of the socially responsible crowd. While Reebok and Timberland stayed, only Nike was ousted from the KLD index.When I asked Mr. Fernald to explain why Nike was bad, but Reebok was good, he said, “We wrestled with that at the time.” Reebok, he said, had taken some positive steps, but more than that: “Nike was the market leader. And there is an extra burden for the market leader.” In other words, Nike was being punished because it had beaten its competitors in the marketplace, not because its practices were any worse than anyone else in the industry.Today, a decade later, there is no doubt that Nike has done a lot to change its ways. It monitors its supply chain rigorously. It publishes data on its Web site. It has become a company deeply invested in corporate social responsibility, with 97 employees working solely on that division. Hannah Jones, who leads Nike’s efforts, told me that corporate responsibility was now embedded in the fabric of the company.Ms. Jones also said that the company has come a long way in helping those factory workers. And virtually everyone I spoke to, with the exception of Mr. Keady, agreed.But it is also true that for most of those workers, pay is still low, conditions are still less than ideal and change is slow in coming, something Nike is pretty forthright in conceding. There are still lots of problems at the factories that make Nike sneakers.Yet Nike is now back in KLD’s good graces. Which is fine. But when I read a recent KLD report about Nike I had no sense that the firm had any deep knowledge of what is actually going on in those factories and how much of it is Nike’s responsibility. Mostly, it was compiled from news clips and the like, much of which was from 2004 or even earlier.“To throw them out was a questionable decision,” said Dara O’Rourke, an associate professor at the University of California, Berkeley, who has closely studied Nike’s overseas outsourcing. “And to put them back in was equally questionable.” In his opinion, both decisions were based more on public perception than reality.Surely, he’s right. It would be nice if we could invest our money only in companies that had terrific human rights record, fabulous environmental values and wonderful compassionate cultures.'"

"'07-04-08,'0','The United States will next meet Sweden in the semifinals, which will be played Sept. 21-23 in Sweden. The Swedes clinched their quarterfinal against Argentina earlier Saturday with a victory in the doubles for a 3-0 lead.Confidence is growing that the United States finally has the team to win it all for the first time since 1995.“This is certainly one of our best shots in at least the last 10 years, absolutely,” said Arlen Kantarian, the chief executive of professional tennis for the United States Tennis Association.The United States overcame some concerns heading into the quarterfinal and surprisingly dominated Spain.

The Bryans went ahead, 6-4, in a tie breaker in the fourth on a winner off the net cord by Mike Bryan. They closed out the match with Bob Bryan’s winning volley on the 12th point.“It was a scary match,” Mike Bryan said. “They were playing with no pressure after we got up two sets to love.“It felt so good to finish off that last tie breaker.

"'07-04-08,'0','Starbucks strongly denies the charges, and says it will fight them in court. But Starbucks hasn’t suffered anything like the fate that has befallen Wal-Mart, another national chain known for its opposition to unions. While Wal-Mart has been rebuffed in its efforts to enter the New York City market, Starbucks doesn’t seem in danger of becoming a pariah.Judging by the lines at Starbucks stores in Manhattan, one of the most progressive and union-friendly towns in the country, the accusations of union-busting and poor pay may not matter a lot. New Yorkers will probably continue to queue up in the thousands for the privilege of shelling out $4 or so for a caffeine injection. (There are more than 200 Starbucks outlets in the five boroughs.)Activists are asking consumers to sign petitions and send e-mail messages protesting Starbucks’ practices. But they may have a hard time matching the success of the campaign against Wal-Mart.One could chalk it up to the nature of the product Starbucks peddles. Many customers feel they simply can’t get their day started without a caffeine-laden beverage. But some powerful, far-reaching trends — like consumers’ viewing their spending choices as political expression — may also help explain why a company can maintain its assiduously polished progressive reputation while also bitterly fighting unions.Do-goodism is an important component of Starbucks’ brand appeal. Starbucks is regarded as one of the most progressive members of the Fortune 500. It provides health care benefits and stock options to many part-time employees. It says it is committed to paying coffee growers in impoverished companies above-market prices for the beans. And its chief executive, Howard Schultz, called for universal health care coverage long before it became popular for corporate chieftains to do so.“People prefer to do business with and work for socially conscious companies,” writes Joseph A. Michelli, author of “The Starbucks Experience.”The same holds true at Whole Foods. Like Starbucks, the organic foods supermarket maintains what it calls socially responsible sourcing guidelines and supports alternative energy. (In 2006, Whole Foods made what it says was the biggest corporate purchase of green power ever.)Again, like Starbucks, it has a chief executive, John Mackey, who is hostile to organized labor. In 2003, he told Fortune magazine that unions are “highly unethical and self-interested.” And, like Starbucks, Whole Foods suffers no apparent consumer sanction as a result of its position. Sales rose 12 percent in the first quarter.Why? One explanation, of course, is that with each passing year, unions occupy a smaller space in our culture. In 2006, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, a mere 12 percent of employed wage and salary workers were members of unions, down from 20.1 percent in 1983. In 2006, only 7.4 percent of private-sector employees were union members. As a result, very few of the people who pop into Starbucks each day for a jolt of energy are members of unions themselves, or are related to union members.A change in the nature of political activism may also explain any possible disconnect. Activism is increasingly taking the form of consumption. “People are interested in doing a little bit better by the planet while they’re shopping,” said Mark Whitaker, the former Newsweek editor who is publishing Sprig, a new Web site for environmentally conscious consumers.To register their concern about global warming, people can petition their government. Or they can pay above-market prices for reliable, prestigious products that reduce emissions and save energy: a Prius instead of an S.U.V.; compact fluorescent light bulbs instead of incandescent bulbs; wind energy instead of coal-fired electricity.By the same token, many people are willing to pay a premium for Starbucks coffee and Whole Foods vegetables in part because they swear by the products, and in part because the companies trumpet their “good corporate citizen credentials.” Whether the associates and team members who sell them $4 coffees and $7-per-pound heirloom tomatoes agree with that assessment may not matter.'"
"'07-04-08,'0','As this defense-first team prepares for the start of the Stanley Cup playoffs this week, potential opponents in the loaded Western Conference are well aware of the danger this duo will present.“Everybody can see what we can do together,” Demitra said recently. “He’s a special player, and he can read me, and he makes my game much easier. Obviously playing with him is an easier game for him or me.”Entering yesterday’s regular-season finale against the Blues, Demitra was tied with Brian Rolston for the team lead in points with 64. Gaborik would be ahead of them had he not missed 34 games because of a nagging groin strain. He had 55 points, including 30 goals for the fourth time in his career.“We’re pushing each other, and we always want to do the best we can,” said Demitra, who was acquired in a trade last June with the Los Angeles Kings.Their synchronized, exceptional offensive skills have led to problems. Coach Jacques Lemaire last week implored Demitra and Gaborik — who frequently face top defensemen from other teams — to dump the puck in the corner and follow up with a strong forecheck when necessary, instead of trying difficult, fancy passes through neutral-zone traffic.Gaborik has 7 goals and 11 assists in his last 13 games, but Demitra went a season-long five games without a goal or an assist and was scratched from Thursday’s game against the Edmonton Oilers because of a strained leg muscle.Lemaire said he was not worried about their synergy growing stale.“They’ll be fine,” he said. “As soon as the intensity will go up automatically, these guys will get ready, there’s no doubt.”The first player drafted by Minnesota, which entered the N.H.L. in 2000, Gaborik was forced to change his physical preparation while being sidelined with his injury for two and a half months. He now arrives at the arena an extra half-hour early for deep-tissue massages and stretching and will enhance his summer routine to take better care of his muscles.“He came out of his car and jumped on the ice and went 100 miles per hour,” Lemaire said, referring to Gaborik’s past habits. “No wonder he blew out a tire. He didn’t even check the oil.”Gaborik’s rehabilitation earned him a nomination from the local chapter of the Professional Hockey Writers’ Association for the league’s annual Bill Masterton Memorial Trophy. It is awarded to the player who best exemplifies the qualities of perseverance, sportsmanship and dedication to hockey.“It’s nice to be in company like that,” Gaborik said.The Wild, which made a surprising run to the conference finals in 2003, has more scoring power this season with Demitra, Gaborik and Rolston leading the way.“We have a better team than then, you know?” Gaborik said. “We can play as a team like we did then. Hopefully we can work as hard as we did and good things will happen.”It will take more than a couple of goals by Demitra and Gaborik for Minnesota to enjoy success similar to that of four years ago.“We can’t have anybody floating or anybody having an off night — or it’s going to end up down our throats,” Mark Parrish said. “It doesn’t matter whether it’s those two, or myself, or Rolston, or whoever it may be. We need everybody playing their best hockey.”'"
"'07-04-08,'0','Certainly, a growth rate of 6.3 percent is nothing to sneeze at. In fact, Mike Thompson, managing director of global research at Thomson Financial, points out that this would be fairly close to the historical earnings growth rate of about 7 percent. And this rate of growth, he added, “is far more sustainable than the double-digit rates we’ve seen lately.”The mere fact that profit growth is slowing isn’t necessarily a disastrous development for stocks.For example, Mr. Stovall looked at past periods of slowing earnings growth from 1966 to 2000. He found that in 4 of the last 10 such periods, the S.& P. 500 lost value. But this means that in a majority of cases, stock prices still managed to climb in the face of slowing profits. In fact, the average gain for the S.& P. 500 during these slowing periods was a respectable 7 percent.Still, the pace of earnings growth is an important variable for investors to consider. Many market strategists believe that earnings have a bigger influence on the stock market than the overall economy does.Mr. Ablin put it this way: “If you told investors that the economy would grow by only 1 percent but profits would continue to grow at a double-digit pace, you’d find the market would continue to climb higher.”What’s important is not just the rate of earnings growth, but also the underlying trends. When earnings growth is low but on the upswing, it’s often a good time to invest, said Tim Hayes, chief investment strategist at Ned Davis Research in Venice, Fla. That’s because investors are anticipating better times to come.But periods when the earnings growth is high but falling tend to be challenging for the market, Mr. Hayes said.It’s during these periods, he said, that “the market begins to question the sustainability of earnings growth.” And “the market becomes vulnerable to disappointments,” he added.Despite the swoon in stock prices in late February, the markets haven’t come close to pricing in the coming earnings slowdown, in the view of Richard Bernstein, chief investment strategist at Merrill Lynch.“What’s happening now is an odd situation where earnings growth looks like it’s slowing, but people are hesitant to make that bet because every time they’ve made that bet in the recent past, earnings have surprised to the upside,” Mr. Bernstein said.For the last 15 of the last 16 quarters, analysts’ estimates for earnings growth have turned out to be too pessimistic. And Mr. Thompson added that analysts have recently underestimated actual earnings by around 3 percent.“It’s now almost become a Pavlovian response,” Mr. Bernstein said, where investors immediately bet on better-than-expected earnings once analysts post their forecasts.But is it safe to keep counting on analysts being too pessimistic? These misses tend to come in distinct cycles. From 2001 to 2003, for example, analysts consistently overestimated the earnings capacity of corporations. Before that, in 2000, they routinely underestimated profits. And in the late ’90s, their outlooks were again too rosy.To be fair, at least a couple of forces could help earnings exceed expectations this time around. For starters, corporations are continuing to buy back stock at a record pace, in effect reducing the supply of shares on the market. This could improve earnings per share without bolstering the profits themselves.Furthermore, the dollar continues to weaken, Mr. Bernstein said. And this could improve the profit outlook of American companies that do business abroad.Still, it’s important to consider which earnings are slowing the most.For example, at the start of the year, earnings in the energy sector were predicted to grow 13 percent for the first quarter. Now, they’re expected to fall by 3 percent. At the same time, profits for consumer-discretionary companies — which make goods that households tend to buy when times are flush, like cars — are predicted to drop 10 percent in the first quarter.Mr. Thompson argues that the expected drop in consumer-discretionary earnings is largely attributable to weakness in the home-building sector as well as at the Ford Motor Company.NEVERTHELESS, it’s clear that the sectors driving these downward revisions are predominantly economically driven ones like industrials, basic materials and technology.In fact, technology earnings, which at the start of the year were expected to grow 17 percent in the first quarter and 20 percent in the second, are now forecast to increase by just 10 percent and 12 percent, respectively.What does it all mean? Perhaps investors who have been studying the economy to gauge the outlook for future earnings growth should look in the opposite direction. The already slowing profit picture indicates that the economy has been weak for some time and may be weaker than some people have assumed.And if that’s the case, investors may start to question what exactly is propping up the current bull market.'"
"'07-04-08,'0','This case was a rude reminder that his careful self-presentation comes with a price. He is no more likely than any other justice to yield on what he regards as a matter of principle. But the raised expectation of consensus magnifies a defeat like this one: his consensus project lost as well.That Chief Justice Roberts cast a dissenting vote in Massachusetts v. Environmental Protection Agency was no great surprise. He had advocated a narrow view of standing, particularly in environmental cases, since his days as a lawyer in the Reagan administration.Fourteen years ago, as a lawyer in private practice, he published an article in The Duke Law Journal praising a 1992 opinion by Justice Antonin Scalia that cut back sharply on the ability of environmental groups to challenge government policies in federal court. (Dissenting from that decision, Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, Justices Harry A. Blackmun and Sandra Day O’Connor declared that they could not “join the court on what amounts to a slash-and-burn expedition through the law of environmental standing.”)A relaxed doctrine of standing, the future chief justice warned in his 1993 article, “would transform the courts into ombudsmen of the administrative bureaucracy, a role for which they are ill-suited both institutionally and as a matter of democratic theory.” And in his dissenting opinion last week, he quoted from the Scalia opinion in arguing that “the redress of grievances of the sort at issue here ‘is the function of Congress and the chief executive,’ not the federal courts.”Massachusetts should not have been permitted to proceed with its lawsuit against the federal agency, the chief justice argued, because it met none of the three essential ingredients for standing: an actual injury; proof that the injury was due to something the defendant did or failed to do; and proof that the injury would be redressed if the defendant did as the plaintiff asked.In the majority opinion, Justice John Paul Stevens found five votes for the conclusion that Massachusetts not only met all three tests but was also entitled to special deference for its claim to standing because of its status as a sovereign state. Invoking no modern precedent — because there was none — to support this new theory of states’ rights, Justice Stevens deftly turned the court’s federalism revolution, which he has long opposed, on its head and provoked an objection from the chief justice. States have “no special rights or status” when it comes to standing, Chief Justice Roberts said.It was his vehemence rather than his dissenting vote that was the surprise. This was no dry document written by a law clerk. The chief justice was spending capital and speaking in his own voice. The opinion was reminiscent of many by his mentor, William H. Rehnquist, for whom he clerked. Standing was a big issue back then, and Associate Justice Rehnquist dissented from decisions that interpreted the doctrine generously. One was a case called United States v. Students Challenging Regulatory Agency Procedures, or SCRAP.Five law students sued the Interstate Commerce Commission for approving a railroad rate increase that they said would cause them “economic, recreational and aesthetic harm” by leading to air pollution and environmental degradation. That claim was sufficient to establish injury for the purposes of standing, the majority said. Justice Rehnquist joined a dissenting opinion that warned that “we are well on our way to permitting citizens at large to litigate any decisions of the government which fall in an area of interest to them and with which they disagree.”Justice Scalia’s decision in the 1992 Defenders of Wildlife case had seemingly brought SCRAP to an end. But now, according to Chief Justice Roberts, SCRAP is back. “Today’s decision is SCRAP for a new generation,” he said mournfully near the end of his dissent.So is it fair to conclude that in this case, Chief Justice Roberts is Rehnquist redux? Not quite.In 1976, four years into the Rehnquist tenure, Professor David L. Shapiro of Harvard Law School wrote a famous article that boiled the justice’s philosophy down to three premises: (1) in a case between the individual and the government, the government wins; (2) in a case between state and federal authority, the states win; and (3) when there is a question about whether a federal court has jurisdiction to decide a case (like whether the plaintiff had standing), the question should be resolved against jurisdiction (or against standing).Those observations held up remarkably well during Justice Rehnquist’s tenure. But last week’s case placed the second and third propositions in irreconcilable conflict: the state could win only if it had standing.Never having faced such a case, William Rehnquist did not have to choose between principles. For Chief Justice Roberts, limiting standing was more important than deference to the states, a choice rich with implications as the Roberts court continues to reveal itself.'"
"'07-04-08,'0','The stock market had a short but splendid week, with gains that brought the three major indexes close to the peaks they had reached before the sharp global sell-off that started on Feb. 27.The stock market was closed for Good Friday but it climbed on the four days in which it was open, in part because of a wave of mergers and acquisitions — or attempts at them. For example, Kirk Kerkorian, the billionaire investor, made a $4.5 billion bid for Chrysler. And First Data, the credit card processor, agreed to a takeover offer from Kohlberg Kravis Roberts for about $29 billion. First Data shares rose 20 percent for the week, the best weekly performance in the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index.For the week, the Dow Jones industrial average gained 205.85 points, or 1.7 percent, to close at 12,560.20. The S.& P. 500 climbed 22.90 points, or 1.6 percent, to close at 1,443.76. The Nasdaq composite index jumped 49.70 points, or 2.1 percent, to close at 2,471.34.The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note rose to 4.75 percent from 4.65 percent the previous week. The yield jumped during abbreviated bond market trading on Friday, in response to a strong Labor Department report on employment in March. JEFF SOMMER'"
"'07-04-08,'0','However, long-term equity incentive awards are reported as payouts for companies filing under the old S.E.C. rules; grant-date fair values are used for companies filing under the new S.E.C. rules.Stock and option awards are calculated differently in the two tables. For companies filing under the new S.E.C. regulations, option and stock award values were compiled from the new stock-grant table as reported by the company in its proxy statement.For companies filing under the S.E.C.’s old regulations, stock award values are taken, as reported, from the “restricted stock award” column of the summary compensation table in its proxy. Likewise, option award values are taken, as reported, from the proxy’s option grants table when available. When not available, option award values are estimated by using the Black-Scholes formula. The total compensation figures for all executives exclude gains from stock options awarded in past years but exercised in 2006. Those gains appear in the columns labeled “Stock Option Gains” in Tables 1 and 2.Companies filing under the S.E.C.’s new compensation disclosure regulations also disclose a value for stock award gains. These gains are excluded from total compensation figures and appear in the column labeled “Stock Award Gains” in Table 1.THE study also tracks information on pension and nonqualified deferred-compensation plans for companies filing under the new S.E.C. regulations. This information, which appears in the “Change in Pension & Def. Comp.,” “Lump-Sum Pension” and “Deferred Comp. Balance” categories in Table 1, is now provided by the recent disclosure requirements.For chief executives who served only part of the fiscal year in that position, the study annualizes their salaries based on disclosed employment contract information or prorates their salaries based on their time as chief executive. All other compensation elements are not prorated.Where averages and medians are used, they are calculated separately for companies listed in Tables 1 and 2.The methods for calculating year-over-year change in pay are also different for each table. For companies filing under the old S.E.C. regulations (Table 2), the change-in-pay calculation is based on all pay elements listed in the table except “Perks/Other.” All values can be directly compared with the previous year.For companies filing under the new S.E.C. regulations, change in pay is calculated by using data from both the new and old disclosure regimes. Therefore, not all elements of pay can be directly compared, and some elements of pay have been recalculated.The annual change in pay value for executives in Table 1 is based on this calculation of total compensation: the sum of base salary, bonus (the sum of discretionary bonuses and short-term cash incentives for 2006), the estimated value of performance- and service-based stock option awards, restricted stock awards and the calculated target value of long-term cash and equity incentives.While the method for calculating the change in pay in Table 1 is slightly different than the process for measuring total compensation in the table, the change-in-pay calculation allows for a consistent comparison across the two sets of S.E.C. compensation disclosure rules. The use of target values for long-term equity incentives and other assumptions used to value pay elements might understate or overstate the change in pay.Definitions of terms used in the pay tables are online at nytimes.com/executivepay.'"
"'07-04-08,'0','Gilman Gunn, manager of the Evergreen International Equity fund, has long admired “big consumer-staples companies that have global reach.” These companies were not the most lucrative path to profit as the global economy and stock markets were moving ahead without interruption, but their stocks have been paying off lately.During the market decline in late February and part of March, consumer staples stocks “outperformed by a considerable margin,” he noted.William Fries, co-manager of Thornburg International Value, is another who prefers “consistent earners” in an iffy climate. His favorites include Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, the Israeli manufacturer of generic drugs; Next, the British clothing retailer; and Rogers Communications, the Canadian cable television company — all of which, he said, are reasonably well insulated from problems in the broader economy. Even when the economy is on less-than-firm footing, he said, “people are not going to stop paying their cable bill.”They are not going to stop eating and drinking, either, an attraction of many businesses that Mr. Gunn prefers, including Unilever, the British-Dutch maker of food and household products; Cadbury Schweppes, the British food and drink company; and Carrefour, the French retailer.Also in their favor, he said, is their willingness to take steps to reinvent themselves after years of disappointing investors. He applauds the efforts of these companies and others in different sectors, like Siemens of Germany and Michelin of France, to revamp operations. The shares stand a good chance of advancing if restructuring efforts succeed, Mr. Gunn said.And maybe even if they do not. The companies’ low valuations leave them ripe for takeover bids, another factor that should put a floor under their stocks, he said. “Time is short for these guys,” he remarked. “It’s really close to the point where if they don’t do it, others will.”AS far as Christopher Semenuk, manager of the TIAA-CREF International Equity fund, is concerned, time has already run out for Unilever, Siemens and others that he dismisses as serial restructurers.“We almost never own those kinds of companies,” he said. “They are typical restructuring companies and are not performance-oriented.” Instead of overhauling their operations to enhance growth, he said, they “always try to acquire their way out of trouble, and they always seem to pay too much.”When discussing the companies he prefers, Mr. Semenuk sounds more like their shrink than their shareholder. “We’re focused on companies that are self-help-oriented,” he said. When they take steps to “uncover or realize value in their businesses, they’re doing things that they’re in control of and that the market is less in control of.”Examples include Reckitt Benckiser, the British maker of household products, which he credits with continually replenishing its repertoire of products and increasing sales at a faster clip than rivals, and Danone, the French producer of yogurt and other foods. “Danone is a perfect example of a management that does restructure,” he said. “They’re always getting rid of businesses that they don’t see a future in and plowing money back into businesses where they do see a future.”Referring to the company’s fast earnings growth, he said, “It’s not a cheap stock, but you get more than what you pay for.”These companies happen to sell consumer staples, but Mr. Semenuk, unlike Mr. Gunn, has no special affection for the sector. What makes Danone and Reckitt safe, Mr. Semenuk said, is not so much what they make as how they make it.“There are good defensives and bad defensives,” he said. “People need to eat, but if companies never grow, how is that defensive?”Other safe choices that he highlighted include Bayer, the German health care and chemical business; Accor, the French hotel company; and Kao, a Japanese maker of household and personal care products.As in other facets of life, the best defense for an investor can be a good offense. For Mr. Fries at Thornburg, that means buying Western companies that do big business in emerging markets. Even if growth slows around the globe, his reasoning goes, it is still likely to be stronger in emerging markets than in the developed world. An example is PotashCorp, based in Saskatchewan, which is finding healthy demand for its fertilizer in emerging economies.Mr. Fries cited China Mobile, that country’s dominant provider of cellphone service, as a company that combines the safety of a utility with the growth prospects available in emerging markets. It has 300 million subscribers, he said, and is adding 3 million to 4 million a month.“China Mobile will have a growing inventory of subscribers at revenue rates that over time will expand,” he predicted. As a national corporate champion in a country where free-market principles are not always applied rigorously, he added, it may also benefit from government assistance in acquiring radio frequencies and infrastructure for its network.Mark Headley, manager of Matthews Pacific Tiger and other Asia funds, advises investors in the region to “look for quality assets that have gotten ahead of themselves.” He says he has been finding them in markets like Thailand and South Korea that are reasonably valued yet have been buffeted lately, along with far more richly priced markets like China.If some of the cheaper stock markets “take a 20 percent haircut,” he said, “they’ll start to look very exciting.”When conditions are unsettled, Hugh Young, head of equities at Aberdeen Asset Management, says he finds the best havens to be companies with “strong balance sheets and robust business models.”His choices include Oversea-Chinese Banking Corporation, known as OCBC Bank, of Singapore; Swire Pacific, a Hong Kong conglomerate; QBE, the Australian insurer; Femsa, the Mexican beverage company; Banco Santander of Chile and Petroleo Brasileiro, the giant Brazilian oil company.Mr. Young said he was having trouble finding safe investments in emerging markets because so many of his peers were looking for them. “The trouble is that the shares prices of many of the classically defensive stocks have risen,” he said. “Ultimate safety may lie only in cash.”Americans who choose to stay in stocks may start seeking safety closer to home, Mr. Semenuk said. Although foreign markets have shown resilience this year, he wonders how long investors will stick with them if conditions remain difficult.“When people are confident, they go to Europe, then when they feel really good they go to Asia,” he said. “Then in times of trouble they head back the other way. People always migrate westward in times of trouble.”'"
"'07-04-08,'0','Also missing from a show attended by lots of high rollers will be the $1.4 million Bugatti Veyron 16.4. And, in perhaps the oddest omission in a city where drivers truly do think small, the tiny Smart cars that go on sale in the United States early next year skipped this show.Still, there are plenty of cars that deserve the attention of New Yorkers attending the show. Here are a dozen highlights:1. FORD FLEX Hmmm. Ford hires Boeing guy as president. Ford announces new vehicle with seating for six.But relax: it’s not six across, with two middle seats and a center aisle for a drink cart. The 2008 Flex is a six-passenger people mover (a seventh seating position is available) based not on the Boeing 737, but on the Ford Fairlane concept car of 2005.This classy-looking crossover wagon is clearly a knock-off of vintage models from Ford’s Land Rover division. When Ford first showed the Fairlane at the 2005 Detroit auto show, the question was asked, “Will Ford build it?” My reply was, “Over Land Rover’s dead body.” That, it seems, was not a consideration.2. FUNKMASTER FLEX FORD EXPEDITION Please don’t confuse this funked-out S.U.V. with the unfunky Flex crossover. The hip-hop impresario Funkmaster Flex actually introduced a nearly identical version of the Halloween-hued Flexmobile last November in Las Vegas, at the huge Specialty Equipment Market Association trade show for the aftermarket customizing industry.Flex’s Expedition is one of three customized limited editions that Ford is showing in New York. The two others are an F-150 pickup reimagined by the customizer Chip Foose and a 540-horsepower King of the Road Mustang, the Shelby GT500KR, finished by the racecar legend Carroll Shelby.3. GMC YUKON HYBRID What’s new in environmentally friendly green machines at the auto show? Shockingly little, though General Motors is showing some new hydrids including the 2008 Yukon. This is G.M.’s first full-size S.U.V. hybrid, and it features a two-mode system developed in conjunction with DaimlerChrysler and BMW that results in a mild increase in mileage. The two-mode Yukon hybrid goes on sale late this year.The most intriguing electric car at the show may be one in the display of LeMay collection classics in a far corner downstairs. Look for the 1912 Standard Electric, a fully functional battery-powered runabout that would put many of today’s electric car concepts to shame.4. TAXI ’07 Hybrid hunters may be more successful outside the convention hall. This curbside exhibit, organized by the Design Trust for Public Space, demonstrates what the future may hold for the city’s bumblebee-colored taxi fleets.Taxi 07 is not a static display; the vehicles actually work, and in some cases make runs through Midtown. The exhibit features electric cars, gasoline-electric hybrids and taxis with special features for riders with limited mobility. And be sure to savor this bit of fantasy: the exhibit and the taxis are waiting daily, fair weather or foul — unlike cabs on the real streets of New York.5. BENTLEY BROOKLANDS: Neither you nor your chauffeur may ever drive a 2008 Brooklands coupé (say COO-pay), but you can drool over it here.This latest derivative of the Arnage sedan is expensive, with a price around $350,000, and it’s exclusive, since only 550 will be built. It is also fast, since it comes with a 530-horsepower twin-turbo V-8 that churns out an incredible 775 pound-feet of torque.The Brooklands made its world debut at Geneva last month, but it is new to New Yorkers, as is another dream machine from Geneva, the $130,000 Maserati GranTurismo coupe.6. DODGE DEMON The success of G.M.’s new small sports cars, the Saturn Sky and Pontiac Solstice, hasn’t gone unnoticed by DaimlerChrysler. The Dodge Demon is the Chrysler Group’s answer. This sleek little roadster initially gets only 172 horsepower, but it should still be very quick because it tips the scales at just 2,600 pounds. A high-horsepower version may also be in the works, however. This is definitely one of the show’s top head-turners.7. SUBARU IMPREZA WRX The outgoing WRX (and its sister vehicle the Tribeca, also being hastily redesigned) was as ugly as a toad, but with a relatively light weight, a turbocharged engine and all-wheel drive, it was Mr. Toad’s Wild Ride. The new model looks as if it received, if not a full-blown open-mouth kiss, at least a peck from a princess. Now it has a measure of beauty to go with the brawn. What’s not to love?8. SUZUKI SX4 SEDAN This vehicle is Suzuki’s take on a Subaru WRX STi, only without the hot engine, the six-speed transmission and the all-wheel drive. Yes, it only goes half as fast (0 to 60 in about 9 seconds, compared with about 4.6), but it also costs only half as much. It’s also a sporty take on basic transportation that appears to be hitting the right chord with budget shoppers.Last year, Suzuki finally achieved its long-sought goal of selling 100,000 cars in North America. With an improving lineup of enticing models like the SX4, Suzuki probably has some momentum toward its new goal of 200,000 sales by 2010.9. JEEP LIBERTY The replacement for this compact S.U.V. has been long-awaited — for some, since the Liberty displaced the Cherokee in 2002. Despite general disappointment among the motoring press, the Liberty has been a minor hit for Jeep, notwithstanding its polarizing styling, anemic engines, off-road limitations and morbidly obese curb weight (especially with the discontinued diesel engine). The original Liberty caught on with women looking for a soft off-roader with a macho look. The ’08 Liberty’s more angular styling evokes the Cherokee. For a first-person demonstration of how the new Liberty performs, head for the big Camp Jeep sandbox outside the Javits center.10. MERCEDES-BENZ CL65 AMG Only 40 of these celebrations of automotive excess will be available, starting in the fall. How excessive are they? Start with a twin-turbo V-12 engine, 612 horsepower and 738 pound-feet of torque. Add a liquid metal exterior paint that had been available only on auto show concepts. The CL65 commemorates the 40th anniversary of Mercedes’s AMG engine-tuning subsidiary. The new CL65 is slightly larger, more aggressive looking, and has eight (yes, eight) more horsepower than the ’06 model. All for $200,000, give or take a euro.11. HYUNDAI GENESIS The promise of the Genesis is luxury, power and performance on a blue-collar budget. The nearly production-ready concept is due to reach dealers next year and will have Hyundai’s first V-8 engine. On top of upscale styling, the rear-drive sedan flaunts a lush interior, a five-link independent suspension and acceleration from 0 to 60 m.p.h. in less than six seconds. The car will have “well over 300 horsepower,” Hyundai says, and a price “well under $30,000.”12. CHEVROLET TRAX, BEAT AND GROOVE These three design studies being shown by G.M. may be harbingers of new G.M. small cars in Asia and Europe. Because they’re powered by low-output one-liter engines, these putt-putt cars are unlikely to be built or sold in this country. But the company is making a point this year of showcasing the creativity of its worldwide design studios. All three designs shown here come from the former Daewoo studio G.M. acquired in South Korea.BONUS It could be the coolest car on display, and you’ll find it downstairs, far away from the big manufacturers’ exhibits. It’s the Seven-Eight-Nine coupe from a customizer called N2A (for No Two Alike). An amalgam of immortal Chevrolet styling cues from 1957-59, it is crafted on a Corvette chassis. One look and you’ll probably ask the same question I did: why didn’t someone at G.M. think of this?'"
"'07-04-08,'0','When the Papaya King chain was considering towns for its first New Jersey outpost, Clifton was a natural pick.It is home to hot-dog-hawking institutions like Rutt’s Hut and the Hot Grill and an important stop on the Jersey Hot Dog Tour, an annual outing attended by aficionados who swap impressions of casings and buns on Web sites like roadfood.com. Indeed, Clifton may be the hot dog capital of New Jersey.Which means formidable competition for Matt Visconti, a Wyckoff resident who fulfilled a decades-long dream of getting into the hot dog business by opening his Papaya King franchise in January, next to the Italian-food wholesaler Corrado’s Family Affair. It is one of only two Papaya Kings outside New York City; the other is a hot dog truck in Portland, Me.Unlike the product served by the competition, the Clifton Papaya King’s all-beef dog is grilled rather than deep fried, Mr. Visconti said.Then there are the drinks; the blue papaya is something of a classic, a smoothie made with blueberries, bananas, nonfat frozen yogurt and papaya drink ($4.49 for 21 ounces).'"
"'07-04-08,'0','Citing studies showing that high rates of homeownership generate financial wealth for borrowers, reduce crime and stimulate economic growth, the group agreed to a list of initiatives. One was to make financing arrangements for borrowers more affordable and flexible.Lenders were off to the races. They created slick new mortgage products with low “teaser” interest rates that ratcheted up significantly after two years or so. They devised loans that required only the payment of interest, not principal as well. They extended mortgages to 50-year terms to reduce monthly payments.The partnership succeeded. In 2004, the homeownership rate reached 69.2 percent, a record.As recently as January, even as delinquencies among subprime mortgages had risen, the Mortgage Bankers Association, a lobbying group, praised the role that the loans played in bolstering homeownership. “The availability of nontraditional mortgage products is a positive development because these products increase the financing choices available to borrowers,” the group said in a report.But according to experts on lending practices, the products devised to propel homeownership did so only as long as housing prices kept rising. Now that prices have started to fall, these products look instead like a transfer of wealth to mortgage lenders from those who can least afford it: subprime borrowers.“It’s not good to put somebody into a home if they can only afford it when home prices go up,” said Thomas A. Lawler, founder of Lawler Economic and Housing Consulting Daily, a newsletter. “Now that prices are falling, the folks who made enormous amounts of money lending in 2003, 2004 and 2005 are giving some of it back. But they aren’t giving it back to the poor borrowers.”Comparing prime and subprime loans shows how different the two types can be, Mr. Lawler said.Loans made to borrowers with good credit histories, for example, rarely generate prepayment penalties when the loans are refinanced. But 70 percent of subprime loans have such penalties, he said. And they are hefty — typically involving six months’ worth of interest.On a $250,000 loan with a current interest rate of around 8 percent, a prepayment penalty would be $10,000. Because many subprime borrowers do not have that kind of money lying around, lenders typically offer to roll the amount into the new loan offered in a refinancing. Tacking on such penalties to new loans makes it even harder for borrowers to pay them off.Another characteristic of subprime loans, Mr. Lawler said, is that they rarely have escrow accounts. These accounts are established to collect money over long periods to cover real estate taxes and insurance.“For the riskiest borrowers you take away a feature of a mortgage that is designed to force savings — why?” he asked.CRITICS point to two possible reasons: without property taxes added to the mix, the mortgage payments look lower than they otherwise would. In addition, the absence of an escrow account in a subprime loan often means a big tax bill that cannot be paid unless the borrower undergoes another expensive financing, with all those fees attached.Finally, subprime loans with low initial rates that reset at much higher rates almost force refinancings, generating fees for lenders but often putting borrowers in a hole. Now, for instance, subprime loans that reset after two years have interest rates based on the London Interbank Offered Rate of interest, or Libor, which now stands at about 5 percent, plus 6 percentage points.It is almost impossible for subprime borrowers to get lower rates on their mortgages given such reset rates, Mr. Lawler said. “A subprime A.R.M. borrower,” he said, one with an adjustable-rate mortgage “with an initial rate of 8 percent for the first two years would face an upward adjustment on her mortgage unless the Fed cut its short-term rate target to 2 percent.“These loans are designed to make borrowers refinance and keep the loan production mill churning,” Mr. Lawler said.Mr. Calhoun of the Center for Responsible Lending said that few borrowers, subprime or not, would be able to survive a reset shock that increased their monthly payments by as much as 50 percent. Ditto for serial refinancing deals that generate fees of 6 to 10 percent of the total loan value each time.“Probably the majority of homeowners who have been in their house for a while could not afford payments on those loans,” he said.While subprime borrowers try to climb out of the holes they fell into, those who sold and packaged the loans are laughing all the way to the bank. “Folks who ran these companies are going to walk away not just unscathed but extraordinarily well rewarded,” Mr. Calhoun said.Josh Rosner, a managing director at Graham Fisher, an investment research firm in New York and an expert on mortgage securities, says he has watched with interest and exasperation as the same groups of people who pushed for higher homeownership rates now recommend ill-conceived bailouts. He also believes that the current system creates incentives for people to strip equity from their homes rather than use their mortgages as a forced savings device.“If you’re trying to do social engineering, it should be to put people in homes so they can build up equity as a cushion for economic shock,” Mr. Rosner said. “But unless they have significant equity, they are not homeowners; they are renters. We’ve created a society where we love the term homeownership, yet we can’t allow people to understand that they are being taken advantage of by the term.”'"
"'07-04-08,'0','JOHN McCAIN’S April Fools’ Day stroll through Baghdad’s Shorja market last weekend was instantly acclaimed as a classic political pratfall. Protected by more than a hundred American soldiers, three Black Hawk helicopters, two Apache gunships and a bulletproof vest, the senator extolled the “progress” and “good news” in Iraq. Befitting this loopy brand of comedy — reminiscent of “Wedding Crashers,” in which Mr. McCain gamely made a cameo appearance — the star had a crackerjack cast of supporting buffoons: Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, who told reporters “I bought five rugs for five bucks!,” and Representative Mike Pence of Indiana, who likened the scene to “a normal outdoor market in Indiana in the summertime.”Five rugs for five bucks: boy, we’ve really got that Iraq economy up and running now! No wonder the McCain show was quickly dubbed “McCain’s Mission Accomplished” and “McCain’s Dukakis-in-the-Tank Photo Op.” But at a certain point the laughter curdled. Reporters rudely pointed out there were 60-plus casualties in this market from one February attack alone and that six Americans were killed in the Baghdad environs on the day of his visit. “Your heart goes out to just the typical Iraqi because they can’t have that kind of entourage,” said Kyra Phillips of CNN. The day after Mr. McCain’s stroll, The Times of London reported that 21 of the Shorja market’s merchants and workers were ambushed and murdered.The political press has stepped up its sotto voce deathwatch on the McCain presidential campaign ever since, a drumbeat enhanced by last week’s announcement of Mr. McCain’s third-place finish in the Republican field’s fund-raising sweepstakes. (He is scheduled to restate his commitment to the race on “60 Minutes” tonight.) But his campaign was sagging well before he went to Baghdad. In retrospect, his disastrous trip may be less significant as yet another downturn in a faltering presidential candidacy than as a turning point in hastening the inevitable American exit from Iraq.Mr. McCain is no Michael Dukakis. Unlike the 1988 Democratic standard-bearer, who was trying to counter accusations that he was weak on national defense, the Arizona senator has more military cred than any current presidential aspirant, let alone the current president. Every American knows that Mr. McCain is a genuine hero who survived torture during more than five years of captivity at the Hanoi Hilton. That’s why when he squandered that credibility on an embarrassing propaganda stunt, he didn’t hurt only himself but also inflicted collateral damage on lesser Washington mortals who still claim that the “surge” can bring “victory” in Iraq.It can’t be lost on those dwindling die-hards, particularly those on the 2008 ballot, that if defending the indefensible can reduce even a politician of Mr. McCain’s heroic stature to that of Dukakis-in-the-tank, they have nowhere to go but down. They’ll cut and run soon enough. For starters, just watch as Mr. McCain’s G.O.P. presidential rivals add more caveats to their support for the administration’s Iraq policy. Already, in a Tuesday interview on “Good Morning America,” Mitt Romney inched toward concrete “timetables and milestones” for Iraq, with the nonsensical proviso they shouldn’t be published “for the enemy.”As if to confirm we’re in the last throes, President Bush threw any remaining caution to the winds during his news conference in the Rose Garden that same morning. Almost everything he said was patently misleading or an outright lie, a sure sign of a leader so entombed in his bunker (he couldn’t even emerge for the Washington Nationals’ ceremonial first pitch last week) that he feels he has nothing left to lose.'"
"'07-04-08,'0','DETERMINING which auto show can most accurately claim to be America’s biggest is like measuring tall buildings. There are many ways to count and little agreement on which figures are best.Before each of the big American auto shows, publicists send out a flurry of statistics about the number of trailers required to haul in the cars, the miles of lighting in the exhibit hall or the battalions of Teamsters who set everything up.The New York International Auto Show, which opened on Friday at the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center in Manhattan, calls itself the largest. But doesn’t that title belong to the Motor City, which each year is host of the North American International Auto Show? Then again, the Chicago Auto Show also proudly trumpets itself as the biggest.The New York auto show says it is the most-visited, with a claimed attendance of more than 1.2 million visitors in recent years, compared with a little more than 700,000 in Detroit. But the huge attendance number has raised some eyebrows: it means that an average of 120,000 people attend the show each of the 10 days it is open to the public. That’s 10,435 visitors an hour, or 174 a minute. The promoters say the figure includes about 17,000 exhibitors and members of the press, and the rest are people who have either bought tickets or received them in a promotion.The Detroit show is certainly the most closely watched. More than 6,700 journalists received credentials this year, getting far more attention in the global press than any competitor. A two-hour show on the show broadcast nationally by NBC attracted 6.5 million viewers this year.Chicago claims its show is the biggest because it covers the most floor space — some 1.3 million square feet. The exhibit hall in Detroit, Cobo Center, is only 700,000 square feet; the New York show takes up about 846,000 square feet, though plans to expand the Javits Center will presumably create much more floor space eventually.'"
"'07-04-08,'0','Instead of pretzels, long-haul flight attendants might want to consider handing out bags of dried cherries to passengers. According to Dr. Russel Reiter, a nutrition researcher and one of the world’s authorities on melatonin, cherries might help fight jet lag. “Tart cherries contain melatonin, which is then absorbed into the blood stream influencing your biological clock,” he said.According to Dr. Reiter, when flying east (say from New York to London) travelers should eat a handful of dried cherries (which have even greater levels of melatonin than fresh cherries) 30 minutes before trying to sleep. Once at their destination, they should eat a handful of cherries 30 minutes before going to bed every night for the same number of nights as the time change. (For a five-hour time shift, eat cherries for five consecutive nights.) When heading west, do the same regime, only eat your cherries the night before departure.“We have not tested them on humans specifically for jet lag but think it should work,” he said, adding that concentrated cherry juice, and even cherry pie should have the same effect.

"'07-04-08,'0','“We went to the police, and after five minutes the police said, ‘Go home,’ ” Ms. Hasina related. The police told the parents to forget about making accusations against anyone in the feudal lord’s family.So Ms. Hasina traveled to Islamabad, the capital of Pakistan, 400 miles to the north, to appeal for assistance from the government — but she received no help and her trip infuriated the feudal lord’s family. The feudal lord’s family members beat up her family members and warned them to be silent.“They said, ‘We killed the girl, and if you don’t keep quiet we’ll kill all of you as well,’ ” Ms. Hasina explained. She sighed and added: “Everybody says, that is just what happens to poor people.”Yet there is one place that Ms. Hasina and Mr. Rashid have found a sanctuary: the shelter run by Mukhtar Mai here in the remote village of Meerwala. Mukhtar (who also goes by the name Mukhtaran Bibi) survived a gang rape to become a fervent campaigner for voiceless women in Pakistan.I’ve written about Mukhtar repeatedly over the last few years, and she now runs several schools, an ambulance service and a women’s aid group. Her home and courtyard are full of women and girls who trickle in each day, shellshocked by injustice or disfigured by beatings or acid attacks. Mukhtar arranges medical or legal help and does what she can to address their needs.A year ago on a visit to Mukhtar’s village, I wrote about a young woman named Aisha Parveen who was fighting efforts by the police to return her to the brothel from which she had escaped. Mukhtar helped rescue Aisha, and now Aisha is trying to replicate Mukhtar’s work farther south. One of Aisha’s first cases was to help Ms. Hasina after her daughter’s murder.Mukhtar is a hero of mine. But her work has earned her many enemies, particularly among the feudal lords — and even in the government of President Pervez Musharraf, who fears that Mukhtar displays Pakistan’s dirty laundry before the world. So the Pakistani authorities are harassing Mukhtar, trying to break her organization. (For readers who want to help, I’ve posted some ideas on my blog, www.nytimes.com/ontheground. You can also post your comments about this column there.)Most of the pressure right now is on Mukhtar’s top aide and soul mate, Naseem Akhtar. Lately Naseem’s brother was in a mysterious vehicle accident, her father was ordered arrested for no apparent reason and her own house was broken into.Farooq Leghari, a police chief, was transferred away from Meerwala because — he and others say — he tried too hard to protect Mukhtar. He now is police chief in another town and, when I visited him, he told me that “this harassment and pressure on them is from very high up, from Islamabad.”“Their lives are in danger,” Mr. Leghari said of Mukhtar and Naseem, adding that they could be killed by assassins sent by feudal lords or by the Pakistani government itself (our close allies!).So I have a message for President Musharraf: Don’t even think about it. Start protecting Mukhtar instead of harassing her. And if any “accident” happens to Mukhtar or Naseem, you will be held responsible before the world. We are watching.'"

"'07-04-09,'1','He said his captors forced him to sit motionless in an iron chair for extended sessions that totaled hundreds of hours, surrounded him with bright lights, and used other torture techniques aimed at breaking his will. He said he agreed to their terms because they repeatedly intimated that the well-being of his wife and children could not be guaranteed unless he cooperated.“In the end I decided I could not haggle about my children’s future,” he said.Mr. Gao, a lawyer, gained prominence among human rights advocates and grass-roots organizers in China and their supporters overseas for his uncompromising denunciations of the police and judicial abuses and his scathing open letters to senior Communist Party leaders.He called attention to what he described as systematic abuses against members of the Falun Gong spiritual sect, which is banned in China. He also helped organize a hunger strike against intimidation tactics used by China’s State Security forces.Mr. Gao lost his license to practice law in late 2005 and in August of last year he was arrested while traveling in Shandong province.The authorities repeatedly called attention to Mr. Gao’s cooperative attitude in custody. A few months after he was arrested, they released a letter in which Mr. Gao declared that he had severed all ties with his former colleagues in the human rights community and that he did not want to have a defense lawyer represent him in court.In announcing the verdict in his case, judicial officials said that Mr. Gao not only admitted his own crimes, but had also provided information about other outstanding cases.Those claims prompted a mixed reaction among Mr. Gao’s friends and supporters.Some said they worried that he had betrayed former colleagues and expressed disappointment that he had compromised with the authorities after a only short stint in captivity.Others said they suspected that officials elicited a confession from Mr. Gao by using extreme pressure, and that the public release of documents in his case was designed to blacken his name and divide his allies.Mr. Gao issued his first explanation of his confession through Hu Jia, a longtime friend and fellow human rights organizer who managed to reach him by telephone. Mr. Hu recorded the conversation with Mr. Gao’s consent, according to the tape.In the recording, he denied that he had betrayed any secrets that could harm other dissidents. But he acknowledged that he let down his colleagues by confessing.“I don’t have the ability to get news from outside, but I bet much of it is about my so-called “surrender” and “open declaration,”” he said, referring to documents released by the authorities. “When these matters are raised, my heart is flooded with unbelievable shame.”He said he had decided to earn a decent living for his family instead of seeking to change China’s political system.“In the future, I don’t aspire to be much use to society, but rather to be of more use to my family,” he said.But he said intensive security has turned his house into a new jail for him and his family, making it impossible for him to earn a living and forcing him to speak out once again.'"
"'07-04-09,'1','“I see Andy Roddick as the single biggest Davis Cup warrior today,” said Arlen Kantarian, chief executive of professional tennis for the United States Tennis Association. “He’s not going to let any nicks and bruises stop him from helping his team win.”That mentality has taken over this team. The players have set aside their self-interest and found a way to bond for a single goal. Roddick, Blake and the doubles pair of Bob and Mike Bryan, have become friends over time, along with the singles players Mardy Fish and Sam Querrey, who showed up here just to contribute as backups and hitting partners in practice.And having been brought along together by the team captain, Patrick McEnroe, over the past few years, they are now committed to winning the Davis Cup together.“This group is a band of brothers, and these are guys that hold each other accountable to each other,” Kantarian said. “Really, I give credit to Patrick in terms of building that camaraderie. In what is an historically individual sport, to see a group of guys come together with this kind of team that would take a bullet for each other is just tremendous for us all to see.”Not every American team has been so committed to each other or to the Davis Cup in the past. As McEnroe said: “There’s been different times where maybe some of the top players in the U.S., they weren’t enemies, but they weren’t great friends.It is an issue for other countries, too. Consider Spain, which arrived in Winston-Salem without its top player, Rafael Nadal. He chose to rest a foot injury while preparing for the clay-court season rather than play on the fast, hard surface here. How much difference might Nadal have made? In 2004, he defeated Roddick in a crucial match as Spain defeated the United States in the Davis Cup finals.“You know, it’s definitely tougher on your body,” Blake said after his victory against Robredo on Friday. “I’ve never reached the pinnacle of any team accomplishment. I was thinking about it just a few months ago, about the fact that I never won an N.C.A.A. championship as a team. I never won a high school championship as a team. Now to have a chance to do it at the top level would mean the world to me, especially since this team, as I said before, feels like family. We do everything together.”Of course, none of that bonding guarantees victory against Sweden in the semifinals. A lot can happen between now and September. But McEnroe said he liked his chances.“I mean, we feel good,” he said.

"'07-04-09,'1','The Braves, meanwhile, were more than happy to accept the housewarming gifts. If the Mets left St. Louis thinking that the Cardinals had to be better than how they played in getting embarrassed in a three-game sweep, then they left here thinking that the Braves are much improved and will pose a threat all season long.“Not every day’s going to be a party day for us,” Carlos Beltrán said. “We’re going to have to be up for the challenge. The Braves have a great team.”But the Mets also left encouraged by their starting pitching — their first four starters, at least; the fifth starter, Mike Pelfrey will debut on Friday — and the resurgence of Green, who went 5 for 12 this series to raise his average to .375. And they went 4-2 in the first week with their cleanup hitter, Carlos Delgado, who struck out in his first three at-bats Sunday, batting .185.The loss spoiled another strong start by Orlando Hernández, who, coming off his strong start Tuesday in St. Louis, allowed one run on two hits in six innings, and that came on a first-pitch home run by Kelly Johnson, the first batter he faced. With that out of his system, Hernández retired the next eight hitters and 12 of 13, bewildering them in his customary how-did-he-do-that fashion.When he struck out Andruw Jones in the fourth, the speed of his five pitches ranged from 69 miles an hour to 89, and the final pitch was a 75-m.p.h. changeup. In 13 innings this season, Hernández has allowed two runs on seven hits for a 1.38 earned run average.“I had more confidence today on the mound,” Hernández said. “Everything was working for every hitter.”But with the Mets leading by 2-1 with two outs and a runner on base in the seventh, Randolph pulled Hernández for a pinch-hitter. Scott Schoeneweis replaced Hernández and, in 12 pitches, retired two hitters but also allowed a single and issued a walk. With the right-handed-hitting Édgar Rentería due up, Randolph called on Heilman to finish the job. It could have been an opportunity for the right-handed specialist Joe Smith, but he had pitched the previous two games. And besides, there has been no better reliever in the early going at defusing precarious situations than Heilman.In his first outing, on opening night, Heilman came in with the bases loaded and one out and induced a double play. Two nights later, he got Albert Pujols to fly out with runners on first and third. On Sunday, Heilman got Rentería to ground out to end the seventh and then was the obvious choice to face the middle of the Braves’ order and bridge the innings to closer Billy Wagner.It is challenging for a reliever to enter a pressure situation, cool off in the dugout and then come out to start the next inning, and Chipper Jones took advantage by hitting a middle-in fastball to the fence in right-center field for a leadoff double.“It was up more than I wanted it to be, but it wasn’t a bad pitch,” Heilman said.After Andruw Jones struck out, the hot-hitting Brian McCann sliced an outside fastball down the left-field line to drive in the tying run.“That was the mistake,” Heilman said.The next hitter, Jeff Francoeur, poked a double to shallow right, scoring the pinch-runner Brayan Peña with the go-ahead run. They were the first two runs given up by the Mets’ bullpen this season, and when discussing them afterward, Heilman could have been speaking for the team.“I felt better than the results that I got,” Heilman said.The often-injured Braves starter Mike Hampton felt soreness in his reconstructed left elbow while throwing a bullpen session Sunday morning and will be evaluated in New York on Monday by the Mets’ medical director, Dr. David Altchek, who performed Tommy John surgery on Hampton in September 2005. Hampton did not pitch a game during spring training after straining his left oblique muscle. ... David Wright extended his hitting streak to 18 games over two seasons with his eighth-inning single.'"

"'07-04-09,'1','Microsoft planned to announce today that it will make its Windows Live Messenger service available on its Xbox 360 game consoles, bringing instant messaging from the computer to the television.The move was meant to help Microsoft stay ahead of Sony, its chief rival in the electronic games business, in delivering the richest online experience for game players. It is also an element of Microsoft’s overall strategy to connect people across PCs, televisions and mobile devices like cellphones.More than 200 million people use Windows Live Messenger to chat with friends, family members and colleagues. Separately, more than six million Xbox 360 owners are connected to the company’s Xbox Live online community, an enhancement that lets people with broadband Internet connections communicate with one another.In the second week of May, those two worlds will begin to converge. Xbox Live members will be able to link their “gamertag,” the online identity they use within the Xbox community, to an existing Windows Live Messenger account. Players will then be able to chat with their instant-messaging contacts using a virtual on-screen keyboard or a U.S.B. keyboard plugged into the game machine.Microsoft executives said they hoped to offer voice chat between Xbox and Live Messenger users later this year.“We feel this is a huge step in driving social networking further into the family room by allowing Xbox 360 users to I.M. directly from their couch,” said John Rodman, Microsoft’s group manager for the Xbox 360, in a telephone interview last week. “Now you don’t have to manage two separate groups of friends online.”'"
"'07-04-09,'1','David Zellnik’s new play “Serendib,” at the Ensemble Studio Theater, is a celebration of the beta male: the soulful sort, human or primate, who triumphs even as he lacks Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf’s DNA. How typically do beta males succeed in the laboratory of real life? Do alphas always overcome them? Are betas happier, less addled? And about those alphas: Are they genetically predisposed to their alpha-ness, or are environment and circumstance responsible for their aggressive, victory-or-nothing dispositions?These are some of the questions at the heart of Mr. Zellnik’s comedy, which engages some big questions of evolutionary biology and social science as it falls victim to a grating cleverness. Mr. Zellnik centers his story on a group of scientists observing the behavior of monkeys in Sri Lanka. One scientist, Fischke (Joseph Adams), believes that monkeys are capable of happiness and sadness. He also believes that these emotions are codifiable and that the happiest animals are those living in democratic clans with low incidence of intragroup mayhem and stress.His rival, Ramsov, a Russian played with cartoonish arrogance by P. J. Sosko, thinks that all of Fischke’s inquiries amount to no more than namby-pamby research. (“I read your new work is on monkey happiness! Monkey happiness!”) Who really cares if monkeys are in a good mood or not?Ramsov is an alpha guy, and he has come to Sri Lanka to figure out whether the average number of years a monkey spends in a high-status position is determined by genome. We are supposed to find Ramsov an odious creature, but the trouble is, he makes a lot of sense. He is all for hard science over the anecdotal kind and appreciates real rigor and all the rest.The larger problem for Mr. Zellnik is his apparent boredom with the argument he is trying to lay out. The positions of the two men don’t cancel each other out. There can be an alpha gene for monkeys, and there can also be happy monkeys. The real conflict between Fischke and Ramsov devolves into one over a girl. In a parallel, various puppet monkeys, elegantly made by Emily DeCola, are fighting over a girl too. And if that weren’t just too cute enough, Mr. Zellnik adds a pair of publicity-crazed documentary filmmakers to the story, so that we can witness the observers being observed.The packaging is surely too tidy. But at the same time Mr. Zellnik has not shied away from intellectual ambition, and that is more than can be said for many emerging playwrights.'"
"'07-04-09,'1','The White House Teams took place in Amsterdam last February. The 16 invited teams were divided into two groups of 8, with the top two in each section moving into the semifinals. Last month this column featured deals from one semifinal and the final. But the latest edition of the International Bridge Press Association’s bulletin contains several other excellent deals from this event.Let’s start with one that has its amusing side. It was the first board in the match between a German team of Michael Elinescu, Josef Piekarek, Alexander Smirnov and Entscho Wladow; and the team of Sabine Auken and Daniela von Arnim of Germany, Andy Robson of England and Zia Mahmood, a Pakistani who lives primarily in England but represents the United States in international events.At the other table Zia was South. What do you think was his initial call?Elinescu (South) opened with the “obvious” five diamonds. Most players sitting North would raise to six diamonds, hoping that if the defense could immediately take two spade tricks, West would not find that lead. But Wladow wondered if seven diamonds could be made, so he responded five no-trump, which by partnership agreement invited a grand slam. Auken (East) doubled, worried that North was psyching with a weak hand, trying to talk her side out of its due.After two passes, note that if North had redoubled, the contract would have made for plus 1,240 (or 1,640, if East takes only one top spade). But North continued to probe with six clubs. South took a timeout, eventually finding the winning bid: seven diamonds. The subsequent double and redouble came almost through momentum.West found the heart lead that gave declarer a few nervous moments, but the contract was unbeatable. South ruffed one heart on the board and discarded his other heart loser on the club ace for plus 2,660.'"

"'07-04-10,'1','SAN JOSE, Calif., April 9 (AP) — The chief financial officer of the beleaguered video game publisher Take-Two Interactive Software announced his resignation Monday, less than two weeks after a shareholder revolt that ousted the chief executive and several board members.The resignation of the financial officer, Karl H. Winters, took effect immediately. Take-Two named Lainie Goldstein, currently senior vice president of finance, as interim chief financial officer while the company searches for a permanent successor.“Karl oversaw finance at Take-Two during challenging times for the company,” the chief executive, Ben Feder, said in a statement. “I look forward to working closely with Lainie as we continue to address Take-Two’s challenges aggressively and swiftly so that employees can focus on building the company’s bright future.”Financial analysts have been anticipating Mr. Winters’s departure since a coup led by two major stockholders, Oppenheimer Funds and D.E. Shaw Valence Portfolios, which together control nearly half of the company’s shares.The shareholder revolt followed poor results as well as accounting troubles and controversy surrounding the violent and sexual content of Take-Two’s most popular line of games, Grand Theft Auto.At the company’s annual shareholder meeting March 29 in New York, the investment firms elected new directors and stripped Paul Eibeler of his titles as chief executive and president. He was replaced by Mr. Feder, formerly a senior executive at News Corporation.Earlier, Take-Two’s former chairman and chief, Ryan A. Brant, became the first chief executive to be convicted of backdating stock options, a practice that involves pegging stock options to favorable grant dates in the past to bolster the recipients’ award.

"'07-04-10,'1','ROME, April 9 — The government of Prime Minister Romano Prodi came under fierce attack on Monday after the Taliban said it had killed an Afghan hostage who was a colleague of the Italian journalist freed last month in a prisoner swap.That journalist, Daniele Mastrogiacomo of La Repubblica, was freed on March 19 in exchange for five Taliban fighters released by the Afghan government. Italy had lobbied Afghanistan to make a deal. At the time, the Italian government spokesman said, “We think that the life of a person is very precious.”But on Sunday, the Taliban said it killed Mr. Mastrogiacomo’s translator, Ajmal Naqshbandi, after failing to arrange another prisoner swap. Taliban fighters had already killed the men’s driver.The swap that led to Mr. Mastrogiacomo’s release was roundly condemned by the United States, Britain and other allies, which argued that deals with terrorists only make civilians more vulnerable.On Monday, there were fresh complaints in Italy by opposition parties and by a charity group that claimed that the government had paid millions of dollars to free an earlier hostage in Afghanistan. That group, Emergency, acted as a mediator in the case of Mr. Mastrogiacomo.'"

"'07-04-10,'1','James J. Needham, the first full-time paid chairman of the New York Stock Exchange, died on Friday at his home in Southampton, N.Y. He was 80.The cause was complications related to myelodysplastic syndrome, a bone marrow disorder, his son-in-law, Tim Donahue, said.Mr. Needham, a certified public accountant, was named chairman of the stock exchange in 1972 after a reorganization of its leadership, adding public directors and a paid chairman to transform its longtime corporate structure, headed by a president.After leading the exchange during a troubled period, when stock prices were sliding, fixed brokerage commissions were abolished, and securities industry insiders were accused of dominating the organization, he resigned in 1976, with almost two years remaining on his contract.He had a reputation as an independent thinker and advocate for small investors. He was an early supporter of the Securities Investor Protection Corporation, which was established by Congress in 1970 to help shareholders recover money from brokerage firms that declared bankruptcy. In September 2003, he was one of the first former chiefs of the stock exchange to call for the resignation of the chairman, Richard A. Grasso, in a furor over the size of Mr. Grasso’s pay package. Mr. Grasso resigned a few days later.Before joining the exchange, Mr. Needham was a member of the Securities and Exchange Commission from 1969 to 1972 in the Nixon administration. He was the first commissioner who had been a practicing certified public accountant, according to a spokesman for the S.E.C., John Heine. The secretary of commerce, Maurice Stans, sought out Mr. Needham to provide auditing experience alongside the lawyers who dominated the commission.'"
"'07-04-10,'1','Conversion to a profit-making company will take months, even if all goes smoothly, and it may not be completed until next year, which means there will be plenty of time for groups to lobby the Legislature, asking for passage of a law that gives them some of the money.“In our view, this debate is far from over,” said Randi Weingarten, president of the United Federation of Teachers. “A portion of this money should go to the city and the unions.”Hanging over the entire matter is the memory of the only comparable episode in state government. Five years ago, state lawmakers gave Empire Blue Cross and Blue Shield, later renamed WellChoice, permission to convert from a nonprofit company into a profit-making one.In that case, Gov. George E. Pataki and the Legislature devoted most of the expected windfall to powerful interest groups: the health care workers’ union and the hospital and nursing home industries. Mr. Spitzer, who took office in January, has cited that deal as a prime example of poor governing, of spending based on political deals rather than on the public good.But other labor unions learned a different lesson. They vowed that if such an opportunity arose again, they would try to duplicate the success of the health workers.HIP, formed in the 1940s, and G.H.I., which dates to the ’30s, have always been nonprofit companies. Last November, they united — technically, an affiliation, not a merger — under a new umbrella corporation called EmblemHealth, though they continue to operate under their old names.The law provides that the state can allow a nonprofit corporation to convert to profit-making, but that any initial stock issue belongs to the state, in return for the years of exempting the company from taxes.HIP and G.H.I. are special cases among health insurers; they were created specifically to serve government employees, who still make up a majority of people enrolled in G.H.I. and a large fraction of those in HIP. As a result, New York City, its workers and their unions have paid most of the companies’ revenues over the years.More than 90 percent of city employees are enrolled with one of the two companies, and city officials contend that combining them effectively creates a monopoly, which will raise premiums, costing the city hundreds of millions of dollars each year.“The city, its employees and their unions have helped build these companies to what they are today, and if they convert, the city deserves a fair share of the proceeds, to protect the city from the inevitable cost increases,” said Deputy Mayor Edward Skyler.Becoming profit-making would allow the company to raise money by selling stock, and could make it easier to borrow money. Such considerations have become more important with widespread consolidation in the health insurance industry, which has left smaller companies at a disadvantage in competing with large ones.Together, HIP and G.H.I. cover about four million people, making the new corporation one of the largest insurers in the metropolitan area, but there are national companies with more than 10 times as many customers.HIP’s management has favored conversion to profit-making status for years, at times lobbying unsuccessfully for the change in Albany. G.H.I.’s leaders long opposed the switch, but their views have changed in recent months, said Ilene Margolin, senior vice president of G.H.I.“The marketplace demands it,” she said. “Long-term survival requires that we have access to capital.”The Spitzer administration viewed the conversion partly as a way to help pay for the governor’s ambitious new program of research grants, focusing on the use of stem cells. “This money is spoken for, for basic scientific research,” said Dennis P. Whalen, the governor’s chief health care advisor.The budget also states that 10 percent of EmblemHealth’s initial stock issue would go to the New York State Health Foundation, whose mission is to expand access to health care and educate people on health issues. The foundation was formed with some of the Empire stock issue.'"
"'07-04-10,'1','The 56,227 fans who watched the Mets play the Phillies yesterday set a record for opening day at Shea Stadium and gave team officials a chance to test their new parking arrangements.When workers broke ground in August on the Mets’ new ballpark, Citi Field, which is expected to be finished for the 2009 season, one consequence of the construction was the loss of 2,100 parking spaces within yards of the entrance gates to Shea.Yesterday, seven parking lots in Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, near Arthur Ashe Stadium, were open to accommodate fans, a New York City Parks Department official said. Twelve yellow school buses provided by the team shuttled between the lots and the long wooden walkway between the park and the stadium, running past Long Island Rail Road platforms and the subway.“I thought it went very well,” said Dave Howard, the Mets’ executive vice president for business operations, adding that the team could adjust the arrangements during the season and would continue to remind fans that mass transit could take them to Shea quicker and easier than driving and trying to find parking near the stadium.Yesterday, many of those at the stadium said they had heeded advice not to try to park at Shea. Len Reiss, 48, a lawyer from Highland Mills, N.Y., in Orange County, combined public transportation with local knowledge. He parked his car in Flushing, a few miles from the stadium, then took the No. 7 train for one stop. Reiss, who grew up in Flushing, said he decided on that plan yesterday morning when he passed the stadium and saw that parking was at a premium.'"
"'07-04-10,'1','He said his captors had forced him to sit motionless in an iron chair for extended sessions that totaled hundreds of hours, surrounded him with bright lights and used other torture techniques aimed at breaking his will. He said he had agreed to their terms because they repeatedly intimated that the well-being of his wife and children could not be guaranteed unless he cooperated.“In the end I decided I could not haggle about my children’s future,” he said.Mr. Gao, a lawyer, gained prominence among human rights advocates and grass-roots organizers in China and their supporters overseas for his uncompromising denunciations of police and judicial abuses and his scathing open letters to senior Communist Party leaders.He called attention to what he described as systematic abuses against members of the Falun Gong spiritual sect, which is banned in China. He also helped organize a hunger strike against intimidation tactics used by the country’s State Security forces.Mr. Gao lost his license to practice law in late 2005, and in August of last year he was arrested while traveling in Shandong Province.The authorities repeatedly described Mr. Gao’s cooperative attitude in custody. A few months after he was arrested, they released a letter in which Mr. Gao declared that he had severed all ties with his former colleagues working for human rights and that he did not desire to have a defense lawyer represent him in court.Judicial officials said in announcing the verdict in his case that Mr. Gao not only admitted his own crimes but had also provided information about other outstanding cases.Those claims prompted a mixed reaction among Mr. Gao’s friends and supporters. Some said they worried that he had betrayed former colleagues and expressed disappointment that he had compromised with the authorities after a short stint in captivity.Others said they suspected that officials had elicited a confession from him by using extreme pressure and that the public release of documents in his case was intended to ruin his reputation and divide his allies.Mr. Gao issued his remarks, the first explanation of his confession, through Hu Jia, a longtime friend and fellow human rights organizer who managed to reach him by telephone. Mr. Hu recorded the conversation with Mr. Gao’s consent, according to the tape.In the recording, he denied that he had betrayed any secrets that could harm other dissidents. But he acknowledged that he had let down his colleagues by confessing.“I don’t have the ability to get news from outside, but I bet much of it is about my so-called surrender and open declaration,” he said, referring to documents released by the authorities. “When these matters are raised, my heart is flooded with unbelievable shame.”He said he had decided to earn a decent living for his family instead of seeking to change China’s political system. “In the future I don’t aspire to be much use to society, but rather to be of more use to my family,” he said.But he said intensive security had turned his house into a new jail for him and his family, making it impossible for him to earn a living and forcing him to speak out once again.'"
"'07-04-10,'1','New Century Financial, a subprime lender that has filed for bankruptcy protection, should not be allowed to sell $50 million worth of mortgages to a subsidiary of the Royal Bank of Scotland, a United States trustee said yesterday in court papers.Before the sale is approved, New Century should be forced to eliminate or reduce a $1 million breakup fee associated with the deal and to say how it will protect consumer financial data, the trustee, Joseph J. McMahon Jr., said in court papers filed in Federal Bankruptcy Court in Wilmington, Del.The breakup fee, which New Century would pay to the Royal Bank of Scotland if the sale was not completed, is nothing more than a “$1 million windfall” for Royal Bank, Mr. McMahon said in the filing. Federal trustees monitor bankruptcies on behalf of the Justice Department.New Century, based in Irvine, Calif., specialized in making loans to home buyers with poor credit before it filed for bankruptcy protection on April 2. The company is planning to sell most of its assets within the next few weeks, including its remaining loans, loan servicing division and loan origination platform.New Century said Carrington Capital Management had offered about $133 million for the loan servicing unit, which collects and manages mortgage payments. The Royal Bank subsidiary, Greenwich Capital, has agreed to pay $50 million for about 2,000 mortgage loans, most of which are in default.Judge Kevin J. Carey in the Wilmington court will consider approving the rules governing the Royal bank sale in a hearing today, and the Carrington sale on Thursday.'"
"'07-04-10,'1','Environmental groups and the offices of the attorneys general in Vermont and New York, which is a party to the case, say the automakers are overstating the complexity and hardship of such a regulation.“It’s that sky-is-falling approach, but the sky didn’t fall with catalytic converters,” Attorney General William H. Sorrell of Vermont said, referring to the antipollution technology forced on the industry in the 1970s.Last week, in a 5-to-4 decision in Massachusetts v. Environmental Protection Agency, the Supreme Court ruled that the agency has the authority to regulate heat-trapping gases in automobiles. The Bush administration has long opposed that.Instead, more than 12 states, including California, Massachusetts, New York and Vermont, have already or are in the process of moving to regulate such emissions.California has the authority to set air-quality rules, and Northeastern states have long chosen to follow those rules instead of Washington’s. The Supreme Court victory was important for the states, because the approval of the environmental agency is needed before California can regulate emissions involving global warming.Automakers have sued to block the California regulation in federal courts in California, Rhode Island and Vermont, though just the Vermont case has gone forward. That case is scheduled to enter the trial phase today.The battle has exposed fault lines among automakers. Two trade groups representing the major manufacturers are involved in the suit, one dominated by domestic producers and one by foreign.They have clashed in their legal strategies, and just G.M. and DaimlerChrysler, two of the more outspoken companies opposing the new regulation, are directly listed as plaintiffs. The trade groups had initially sued separately but are now plaintiffs in a consolidated suit.The main legal argument uniting the industry is their contention that states cannot regulate carbon dioxide emissions because that would be little different from regulating fuel economy, and Washington has the sole authority to set mileage standards. The recent Supreme Court ruling, however, appeared to undermine that argument.The industry estimates that the new regulation would impose a 50 percent increase in fuel economy for passenger cars and small sport-utility vehicles but a more modest increase for large trucks, effectively making it harder for a company like G.M. to bring smaller vehicles like the Chevrolet Malibu into compliance than its Hummers.An expert hired by automakers said, according to court filings, that DaimlerChrysler, Ford Motor and G.M. “will need largely to exit” from the passenger car and small truck markets.Environmental groups say the industry is ignoring the potential effects of its move to bolster alternative fuels like ethanol, as well as the advent of hybrid electric technology and other technologies.Automakers argued in a court filing in January that “defendants make unsubstantiated predictions that global climate change is having a number of alarming adverse effects.”Michael J. Stanton, the president of the Association of International Automobile Manufacturers, a plaintiff group, said in an interview the position did not represent the views of the mostly Asian automakers who are his constituents, some of whom are trying to create “eco-friendly” reputations.“We believe that there is enough information out there to address climate change and we know that cars — passenger cars and light trucks — contribute, and we want to be part of the solution,” Mr. Stanton said.The regulation California adopted in 2004 was to begin taking effect with 2009 models and to be phased in over eight years. President Bush and Congress more recently discussed fuel economy rules that could potentially accomplish similar reductions for gases tied to global warming, though no firm plan is in place.Among other points, the industry says more fuel efficient cars could be dangerous, because they will be cheaper to drive and lead people to drive more and potentially have more accidents.“Everybody’s getting a good laugh out of the safety claim,” said David Bookbinder, a lawyer for the Sierra Club, which is a party to the case. “Detroit is saying it’s a bad idea for everybody to drive more.”'"
"'07-04-10,'1','As of last October, there were “something like 86” special taxes and surcharges around the country levied on car rentals, and another 48 were being considered, said Neil Abrams, president of the Abrams Consulting Group, which follows the car rental industry.As an example, Mr. Abrams cited a proposal to increase the tax on car rentals in Racine, Wis., by $13 a rental to help finance a commuter rail line.“They see the rental customer who does not vote in local elections as basically an oil well with untapped resources,” he said.Indeed, William McReynolds, Racine’s county executive, has emphasized the point that most of the proposed increase in the car rental tax would be borne by out-of-state visitors and businesses. In an interview, he said the car rental fee was proposed as a way to finance the commuter rail line instead of raising the local sales tax. “The increase in the rental fee is not exorbitant compared to other major communities,” he said.One reason that these types of taxes have proliferated is that until lately, travelers have not had many advocates speaking on their behalf, while an increase in the sales tax is bound to anger local voters. There is also a lack of comprehensive data about the tax rates charged on car rentals and hotel stays, making tracking them a challenge.“It’s not easy to fight this fight because you have to be all over the place,” said Mr. Connors of the N.B.T.A. “We’ve focused on car rental taxes because they’re the most egregious, but it’s also bad with hotels.”One of the most thorough studies of hotel taxes, conducted by the American Economics Group, a consulting firm, found that these taxes added 12 percent to an average hotel bill in 2003, compared with 9 percent in 1997. These “bed taxes” include local sales taxes as well as any taxes charged specifically on hotel rooms.“I think local politicians get the wrong idea that it’s taxing outsiders,” said Charles W. de Seve, the president of the firm. High taxes, he said, can have a ripple effect on a local economy, maybe causing companies to hold an event elsewhere or send fewer employees to a trade show.“There’s a lot of calculating that goes on to figure the effect on any one place,” he said. He cited New York as an example of a city that set off a backlash when state and local hotel taxes, including sales tax, reached about 20 percent of the total bill in the early 1990s. “The slogan at that time was, ‘New York: stay four, pay five,’ because the tax added that much to the bill.”The total tax rate on hotel rooms is now roughly 14 percent in New York City. It typically falls in the 14 to 17 percent range in many other large cities.Joseph A. McInerney, president and chief executive of the American Hotel and Lodging Association, a trade group, said hotel groups were fighting hotel tax increases partly because of the way the money was spent. “Only a small portion of it has been going to promote travel and tourism,” he said.As with taxes on car rentals, taxes on hotel rooms are often used to pay for local projects that may not necessarily benefit visitors; Cincinnati officials have even proposed using money from the county hotel tax to help build a new jail, although a sales tax increase is being considered as a more likely source of financing.Although taxes on air travel have also increased in recent years, that revenue is typically used to pay for travel-related measures, especially security. But airlines — and many travelers — still say these taxes are too high.“Too often, airlines are looked at as a piggy bank with unlimited resources,” said David Castelveter, a spokesman for the Air Transport Association of America, which represents most major airlines. “We pay an unprecedented number of taxes and we will continue to oppose increases in the amount and number of taxes that consumers are forced to pay.”Because of the way airline taxes are calculated, it is difficult to pin down what percentage of a typical airline ticket goes toward taxes, and estimates placing the average as high as 25 percent have sometimes been met with skepticism. Some airline ticket taxes are charged based on the number of takeoffs and landings in a trip (and vary depending on the airport), so a relatively inexpensive flight with two connections may have a higher percentage of tax than a more expensive nonstop flight.Even so, there is little argument that airline taxes have been increasing. The total price for a domestic ticket includes a 7.5 percent federal tax; a Sept. 11 security fee of $2.50 a flight segment (or takeoff and landing), up to $10; passenger facility charges of $3 to $4.50 per airport, up to $18; and a federal fee of $3.40 a segment.Taxes on international tickets can add $200 or more to the total price, including domestic and foreign taxes, and those have been increasing as well. Britain, for example, recently doubled its departure tax.Ron Wagner, a senior vice president with Carlson Wagonlit Travel, a corporate travel management company, said rising airline taxes are definitely on clients’ radar. He noted that airline tickets account for about 80 percent of most companies’ spending on travel. “They’re certainly going to look at how taxes affect them,” he said.'"
"'07-04-10,'1','Psychotherapy for as long as nine months is significantly more effective than short-term treatment for alleviating depression associated with bipolar disease, new research suggests.The drugs used to treat depression are of limited use in treating the repeating depressive episodes of bipolar illness, according to background information in the article, published last week in The Archives of General Psychiatry.The researchers studied 293 patients with bipolar disease at 15 medical centers nationwide. They randomly assigned one group of 163 people to one of three kinds of psychotherapy (cognitive behavioral therapy, interpersonal and social rhythm therapy, or family therapy) consisting of up to 30 50-minute sessions over nine months.A second group of 130 patients was assigned to “collaborative care,” three sessions over six weeks designed to offer a brief version of the most common psychological and behavioral strategies shown to be beneficial in bipolar illness. The participants, whose average age was 40, were followed for one year, and all were also being treated with mood-stabilizing medicines.Cognitive behavioral therapy focuses on challenging and controlling negative thoughts. In interpersonal and social rhythm therapy, patients concentrate on stabilizing daily routines and resolving interpersonal problems. Family therapy engages family members to help solve problems related to the illness, like failing to take medication properly, and to reduce the number of negative family interactions.'"
"'07-04-10,'1','“I don’t think the drug can be saved,” said David Risinger, an analyst at Merrill Lynch, who last week cut his estimates for Exubera sales. Mr. Risinger now expects that Exubera will have $310 million in sales worldwide in 2012, down from his previous estimate of $800 million. Other analysts have also cut their forecasts.Exubera’s problems add to the uncertainties facing Pfizer, whose shares have lost almost half their value since 2000.While the company remains highly profitable, its financial health is increasingly tied to Lipitor, a best-selling cholesterol-lowering medicine that faces competition from cheaper drugs and in several years, patent expiration.In interviews yesterday, Pfizer executives acknowledged Exubera’s problems but said they believed that a new sales push would increase the drug’s revenue. The company will work to convince doctors that insulin, in both inhaled and injectable forms, is underprescribed. And this summer, Pfizer plans to begin directly advertising the inhaler to patients.“Sales have been slower than expected,” said Olivier Brandicourt, general manager for Pfizer’s metabolic and cardiovascular division, which includes Exubera. “It takes time to educate the physician.”Rochelle Chaiken, Pfizer’s vice president for global medical affairs, said almost 60 percent of diabetes patients had overly high blood sugar levels despite being on standard oral diabetes medications. Many of those patients should be taking Exubera, she said.But Pfizer’s marketing may not be enough to overcome the medical, economic, practical and legal concerns that have hurt Exubera. In theory, the drug’s biggest advantage over standard injectable insulin is that it is more convenient and does not require needle pricks.In reality, though, the Exubera inhaler is bulky and can be hard to use, doctors say. The device is nearly as large as a tennis ball can when it is open, and must be repeatedly pumped before the insulin can be inhaled. Making matters worse, Exubera doses differ from those for standard insulin, and converting doses can be complicated, the doctors say.Also, insurers have been reluctant to pay for Exubera, which costs about $5 a day, compared with $2 to $3 a day for injectable insulin.In addition, the needles now used for conventional insulin injections are smaller and less painful than they once were.“Out of 2,000 times or more I’ve tried to start patients on insulin, I’ve only been turned down twice,” said Dr. John Buse, professor of medicine at the University of North Carolina.Doctors and patients have many more options for managing diabetes than they did a decade ago, Dr. Buse said. In the last two years, three new diabetes medicines have reached the market — Januvia, Byetta and Symlin — as well as Levemir, a longer-acting version of injectable insulin.As with Januvia, sales of Byetta, which is made by Eli Lilly and Amylin Pharmaceuticals, have grown quickly.Another concern for doctors about Exubera is that long-term use of inhaled insulin can damage the lungs. Pfizer’s clinical trials show that the drug causes lung function to drop in some patients.The decrease appears to be minor and to reverse if patients stop using the drug. Even so, patients must take a lung-function test before beginning Exubera, something that has discouraged doctors from prescribing it, said Dr. Joel Zonszein, a diabetes specialist at Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx.Dr. Zonszein said he had tried to put about half a dozen patients on Exubera since the drug was introduced last summer. All have stopped using it, he said. “The inhaled market may just not be there,” he said. “The needles we have nowadays are very friendly. They’re easy to take.”Hoping to encourage sales, Pfizer has transferred responsibility for promoting Exubera from its pain management division to its cardiovascular division. The cardiovascular sales force, which helped turn Lipitor into the world’s top-selling medicine, is highly regarded.But the change may not make a difference, said George Grofik, a drug industry analyst at Citigroup. In February, Mr. Grofik’s team surveyed 35 doctors, polling primary care physicians and diabetes specialists, to get their opinions on Exubera.Nearly 9 of 10 doctors had “medium” or “high” awareness of the drug, the survey found. But more than half said they were concerned about Exubera’s safety. They were also concerned about its price and the bulkiness of the Exubera inhaler.Because many doctors seem to have made up their minds about Exubera, Mr. Grofik said, Pfizer will face an uphill battle as it tries to change their views.And by having its representatives promote Exubera when they make sales calls, he added, Pfizer risks taking attention from Lipitor and other more profitable medications.“There’s an opportunity cost in detailing Exubera that could be used on higher-margin products,” Mr. Grofik said.Over the next five years, other drug companies, including Lilly, may receive approval for their own versions of inhaled insulin, said James Reddoch, a biotechnology analyst at Friedman, Billings, Ramsey. The next-generation inhalers are smaller and more convenient than the Exubera inhaler and may attract more prescriptions, Mr. Reddoch said.The lack of interest in Exubera has made Wall Street wonder whether the inhaled-insulin market is as large as drug companies once thought, he said. “It sounds nice on the surface, the fact that you can now breathe in your insulin,” Mr. Reddoch said. “But there are problems from a practical standpoint.”'"

"'07-04-11,'0','Mr. McCain’s presidential bid has been increasingly identified with his advocacy of the war in Iraq, a position that many Republicans have said has weakened him in the competitive Republican presidential field. Mr. McCain went to Baghdad last week where, trailed by a camera crew that showed him wearing a bullet proof vest and protected by a hundred soldiers with rifles. He offered a relatively positive appraisal of the situation there that was widely criticized, by local merchants as well as some of his prospective opponents.“The idea that the situation in Iraq is improving because it takes a security detail of 100 soldiers, three Black Hawk helicopters and a couple of Apache gunships to walk through a market in the middle of Baghdad is simply not credible and reflective of the facts on the grounds,” said Senator Barack Obama, an Illinois Democrats and presidential candidate, at a virtual town meeting sponsored by MoveOn.org that was presented Tuesday night.Mr. Obama, who opposed the war from the start, issued a statement assailing Mr. McCain even before the senator had finished his speech. “Progress in Iraq cannot be measured by the same ideological fantasies that got us into this war, it must be measured by the reality of the facts on the ground, and today those sobering facts tell us to change our strategy and bring a responsible end to this war,” he said.Some Republicans have in recent weeks been advising Mr. McCain to move away from discussing his position on the war, arguing that his being identified with the war accounted for much of the problem he has had with his campaign in recent weeks. With his speech today, Mr. McCain made clear he intended to do no such thing, instead offering a case for war that echoed — and indeed amplified — what President Bush has said.“Our defeat in Iraq would constitute a defeat in the war against terror and extremism and would make the world a much more dangerous place,” he said. “The enemies we face there harbor the same depraved indifference to human life as those who killed three thousand innocent Americans on a September morning in 2001.”He said a United States withdrawal would lead to genocide, which he compared to what happened in Rwanda, “with which we would be complicit.”Even as he warned of the geopolitical consequences of withdrawal from Iraq, he attacked Democrats and suggested that they were trying to gain political advantage from events there. Three of the leading Democratic presidential candidates — Mr. Obama, John Edwards of North Carolina and Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York — have endorsed various plans for redeploying American troops out of Iraq.“Democrats, who deny our soldiers the means to prevent an American defeat, have chosen another road,” he said. “It may appear to be the easier course of action, but it is a much more reckless one, and it does them no credit even if it gives them an advantage in the next election.“This is an historic choice, with ramifications for Americans not even born yet,” he said. “Let’s put aside for a moment the small politics of the day. The judgment of history should be the approval we seek, not the temporary favor of the latest public opinion poll.”At the same time, Mr. McCain said he was not paying attention to political considerations in embracing a war that, if unpopular with the American electorate in general, is strongly supported by Republicans primary voters.“In Washington, Democrats view it as a political opportunity and Republicans view it as a political burden,” he said at a news conference.At the same time, though, Mr. McCain seemed to be laying the groundwork for an argument he can make, later on in this election cycle, should the escalation policy he and Mr. Bush have backed fails. He noted that he had long called for the policy Mr. Bush adopted earlier this year, suggesting that it might have worked better had more troops been sent in earlier.“Having been a critic of the way this war was fought and a proponent of the very strategy now being followed, it is my obligation to encourage Americans to give it a chance to succeed,” he said. “To do otherwise would be contrary to the interests of my country and dishonorable.”Mr. McCain made passing, if joking, reference to his trip to Iraq last week, which produced a spate of stories suggesting that his argument that things were improving there, which he reiterated today, did not reflect the reality in Iraq.“I just returned from my fifth visit to Iraq,” he said. “Unlike the veterans here today, I risked nothing more threatening than a hostile press corps.”'"

"'07-04-11,'0','The senator’s staff has been investigating relations between loan companies and universities. The disclosures last week that the financial aid administrators owned the stock have prompted concerns that they had an incentive to steer students to the loan company. The government official helped oversee lenders in the federal student loan program.The documents describing the transfers of stock as gifts were signed by Mr. Balestri and his wife. They contradict what one financial aid director said in an interview last week. That official, Lawrence Burt of the University of Texas at Austin, said he had paid $1,000 for 1,500 shares. Mr. Burt could not be reached for comment last night.The documents, turned over to the Senate staff by Student Loan Xpress’s parent company, which has been cooperating with Mr. Kennedy’s inquiry, show that Mr. Balestri received the stock in 2001 through a private placement. Such an offering by a company is exempt from many of the rules on public offerings and is generally restricted to sophisticated investors. In such transactions, the purchaser may not turn around and sell the shares to others; that could be the equivalent of a public offering of stock.“We want to make sure the initial private placement is real,” said Jill E. Fisch, director of the Center for Corporate, Securities and Financial Law at Fordham University’s law school. “We don’t want to give it to some people and then have those people distribute it.”Senate aides said Mr. Balestri might have tried to characterize the stock transfers as gifts in an effort to get around the requirement that he hold the shares for a set period of time. A call to the office of Mr. Balestri was not returned. C. Curtis Ritter, a spokesman for CIT Group, which acquired Student Loan Xpress in 2005, declined to answer questions about the stock transactions. CIT has placed Mr. Balestri on leave.Mr. Balestri transferred stock not only to Mr. Burt but also to David Charlow, financial aid director for Columbia’s undergraduate college and its engineering school; Catherine Thomas, director of financial aid at the University of Southern California; and Matteo Fontana, general manager in a unit of the Office of Federal Student Aid at the Department of Education. In recent days, all four have been put on leave by their employers.Senate aides said that for each $10,000 in the private placement, investors had received 10,000 shares and 5,000 warrants, or options to purchase additional stock before a certain date, in Education Lending Group, which was then the parent of Student Loan Xpress. Mr. Balestri obtained $80,000 worth of stock and kept none of it, according to the documents. In a personal list called “memorandums of gift,” he wrote that he gave away 80,000 shares to 16 people on Dec. 31, 2001. That was one day before he began work at the company as its president.The 2001 private placement raised $3.7 million for Education Lending and was authorized by that company’s chief executive, Robert deRose. At the time, the stock was trading between $1 and $2 a share. It is not clear who purchased the rest of the shares or whether anyone else at the company had knowledge of Mr. Balestri’s transfers.'"
"'07-04-11,'0','MONTGOMERY, Ala., April 10 — Answering a question that has become a litmus test of sorts for Republicans campaigning in the South, Rudolph W. Giuliani said Tuesday that he would leave the decision about whether to fly the Confederate battle flag over the State Capitol here to the people of Alabama.“One of the great beauties of the kind of government we have, which is a national/federal government, is that we can make — on a broad range of issues — we can make different decisions in different parts of the country,” Mr. Giuliani said. “We have different sensitivities, and at different times we are going to come to different decisions, and I think that is best left up to the states.”The Confederate battle flag has not flown over the Alabama Capitol for a number of years, and there is no current campaign to return it there. Confederate flags do fly by a memorial to Confederate soldiers near the Capitol.The question about the flying the flag, which was raised in connection to comments by Senator John McCain on “60 Minutes” on Sunday, has tripped up Republican candidates in the past, including Mr. McCain in South Carolina in 2000.Mr. McCain originally said back then the matter of flying a Confederate flag was best left to the states to decide, only to reverse himself and call that flag an offensive symbol that was more than a state matter. On “60 Minutes” he said he regretted that he had “worse than waffled” and blamed ambition for his comments.On Tuesday, Mr. Giuliani offered a window into how he will deal with divisive topics on which more conservative voters might be inclined to disagree with his personal views.'"
"'07-04-11,'0','WASHINGTON, April 10 — A study by Merck of its pain reliever Arcoxia showed similar risks of heart attacks and other cardiovascular problems compared with another painkiller, diclofenac, federal reviewers said in an analysis made public Tuesday.Diclofenac, sold under names including Voltaren and Voltarol, is considered by some cardiologists to be among the most dangerous of standard arthritis treatments in terms of heart safety.The Food and Drug Administration staff summary also noted that Arcoxia patients quit the study at a higher rate because of complications related to high blood pressure.Arcoxia is Merck’s successor to Vioxx pill, which was withdrawn. Arcoxia is sold in 63 countries, and Merck is seeking F.D.A. approval for American sales .An advisory panel of experts from outside the F.D.A. is meeting Thursday to consider approving Arcoxia.'"
"'07-04-11,'0','Isiah Thomas, the Knicks’ president and coach, will be the one most harshly judged if the Bulls land Greg Oden or Kevin Durant with the Knicks’ pick. Yet it is Curry who will be compared to the players the Knicks surrendered.For now, however, Curry is free to bask in the glow of his finest professional season. He returns home as one of the top low-post scorers in the National Basketball Association, just three days removed from a career-best 43-point performance. He has become the dominant offensive force the Bulls once hoped he would become.When it was suggested that the trade helped both teams, Curry paused.“Um, I guess,” he said. “I mean, I think it definitely helped the Knicks. I think the Bulls are going to be O.K. no matter what. They got some good guards over there, they got a great coach over there, they have a system that’s really working for them. Ben Wallace is a great defender, and he really added to that concept of team defense.”But Curry noted, with some degree of satisfaction, that the Bulls’ greatest need is for a low-post scorer.“Tyrus Thomas, we’ll see how that whole thing pans out,” he said. “I mean, he’s a great player, and hopefully he can be the player they need him to be.”The 20-year-old Thomas, a 6-foot-9 forward from Louisiana State, is averaging 5.2 points and 3.7 rebounds in a little more than 13 minutes a game. Curry, 24, is on pace for career highs in points (19.6) and rebounds (7.1) per game. But his former coach, Scott Skiles, shrugged at the apparent improvement.“I don’t want to minimize Eddy’s year,” Skiles said, “but I mean, he’s averaging roughly 3 more points a game than he did here, shooting almost the same field-goal percentage, which has always been very high, in a lot more minutes.”Skiles continued: “Eddy’s having a very good year, but it seems like he’s being put on a pedestal awful quickly here. I don’t think that’s necessarily fair to him, because he’s still such a young player. He’s clearly improving. I like to watch him play, because I like him as a person.”Despite the jeers, Curry retains a fondness for the United Center, his first N.B.A. home. It was also the site of his first great triumph in this breakout season. On Nov. 28, Curry scored 24 points, his season-high at the time. He followed that with a string of 20-point efforts.“I think that was kind of the turning point of the new me,” Curry said Monday night. “I started playing well after that. I’m looking forward to going back. Chicago always plays us tough, and it’s not an easy game.”Stephon Marbury (turf toe) did not dress for the game. Neither David Lee (stress reaction in right leg) nor Renaldo Balkman (stomach virus) traveled with the team. Lee was in uniform Monday night, but did not play. He played only two minutes Saturday in Milwaukee before his leg tightened up. “He’s not healthy enough,” said Coach Isiah Thomas, who admitted he was reluctant to use Lee. “Our future’s really bright, and we definitely don’t want to damage your future by doing something in the present right now that could end up hurting you down the road.”'"
"'07-04-11,'0','On Tuesday, Menu Foods, which made most of the recalled food, expanded its recall for the second time in less than a week, adding 34 varieties of cat food.The company said the food was manufactured at a Canadian plant in December 2006 and January 2007 with a batch of wheat gluten potentially contaminated with melamine. The gluten was shipped to the Ontario facility from its Emporia, Kan., plant. The previously recalled food was manufactured there, and at a plant in Pennsauken, N.J., the company said.Lists of recalled foods are available online at www.menufoods.com/recall.Stores and Web sites that sell pet food made from free-range meat, organic vegetables and brown rice say business has increased markedly since the recall, which affected both low- and high-end brands.Shelley Gunton, a co-owner of Castor and Pollux Pet Works, a natural and organic pet supplies company in Clackamas, Ore., said Web traffic had increased tenfold since mid-March and sales were up nearly 50 percent.“Somebody feeding brand X at the moment will call and say they want to switch to a more organic product, but they want to understand the difference, what it means to be a certified organic pet food,” Ms. Gunton said. “We want to make sure people feel comfortable purchasing organics and won’t go to bed worrying about their pets.”For pet food to be labeled organic, at least 95 percent of the ingredients must be certified organic for human consumption, said Andrea Caroe, chairwoman of the National Organic Standards Board, which is part of the Food and Drug Administration.According to a survey by the Organic Trade Association, organic pet food sales totaled $30 million in 2005, a 46 percent increase from the previous year. Sales were expected to grow by about 36 percent in 2006, and at least 25 percent each year until 2010, the group said.Andi Brown, founder of Halo Pet Foods, which says it takes a holistic approach to pet care, selling food made from human-grade ingredients as well as herbal grooming aids and supplements, said sales of certain food products had increased by more than 90 percent since mid-March. Internet orders have doubled, Ms. Brown said.“It’s very sad that it had to come to this,” Ms. Brown said. “People are fearful, scared out of their wits.”Bree Weasner, who runs preciouspets.org, which sells natural pet products, said food sales had more than doubled.“I’ve always worked seven days a week, but since the recalls I’ve never worked so many hours,” Ms. Weasner said.John Gigliotti, owner of waggintails.com, which sells natural dog, cat and bird food, said business was up 30 percent to 40 percent, spurred mostly by word of mouth. Many customers he talks to are disturbed that officials still do not know whether the melamine made pets sick, he said, and Mr. Gigliotti said he thought the recall would lead to a long-term rise in organic pet food sales.“When the dust settles and we know what happened, it will simply reinforce what we’ve been talking about for years, which is economy-minded manufacturers use economy ingredients,” Mr. Gigliotti said. “Now people want to know all the behind-the-scenes stuff.”Scott Andrews, 45, a tax accountant from Boston, said he did not know what to feed his beagle, Sam. Mr. Andrews said for the time being he planned to give Sam food that was organic or made in New England by small manufacturers.“Every time I open a can, I think of the recall,” Mr. Andrews said in Pet Shop Girls as Sam sniffed around. “I just don’t know what to trust, I guess.”'"
"'07-04-11,'0','ALBANY, April 10 — A veteran state auditor pleaded guilty on Tuesday to stealing $1.2 million that was supposed to be used to help the mentally ill. Under the plea deal, he will face up to 10 years in prison and must sell his collection of Corvettes.The auditor, James L. Leggiero, 50, admitted in Albany County Court that while working at the state’s Office of Mental Health he had created a sham company and approved more than 80 payments to it, ranging from $700 to $99,000, over nine years.“In my official capacity, I authorized these payments,” Mr. Leggiero, a 27-year veteran, told Judge Thomas A. Breslin.Mr. Leggiero pleaded guilty to one count of grand larceny in the first degree, a felony. The plea agreement he reached with the state attorney general’s office calls for him to face a sentence of 3 1/3 to 10 years in prison, pay the $1.2 million back to the state and agree not to seek government work in the future.Mr. Leggiero, who owns five Corvettes, including one from 1958, has agreed to sell many of his possessions to begin repaying the state, his lawyer, Stephen Coffey, said after the court appearance. Mr. Coffey said Mr. Leggiero’s wife would be allowed to keep their house, where she lives with the couple’s two children.Asked why Mr. Leggiero pleaded guilty, Mr. Coffey said: “Well, because the proof was overwhelming. He wanted to put it behind him. He knows he’s guilty.”'"
"'07-04-11,'0','A South Dakota law that would require doctors to tell women seeking abortions that the procedure would “terminate the life of a whole, separate, unique, living human being” will be revisited today by the 11 judges of the federal appeals court in St. Louis.The statute is among many abortion laws around the country requiring counseling and consent. Such laws have been upheld in the Supreme Court and in federal appeals courts, but a federal judge has blocked South Dakota’s law while she considers its constitutionality.The appeals court hearing is a second take on an October decision by a three-judge panel of the same body, the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, that the law should remain blocked because it supplements factual information with a value judgment. The full Eighth Circuit court, acting on an appeal by the state, agreed to reconsider whether to allow the law to take effect.South Dakota’s attorney general, Larry Long, said the appeal was largely based on the one dissenting view on the three-judge panel: that the required disclosure was an obvious fact. The State Legislature, Mr. Long said, had defined “human being” to mean a member of the species homo sapiens, and that phrase does not include a value judgment.“Human being is not a loaded phrase,” he said. “That definition everyone agreed was appropriate.”'"
"'07-04-11,'0','The aluminum company Alcoa reported its most profitable first quarter ever yesterday as rising metal demand from China and the aerospace industry bolstered prices.Net income rose 8.9 percent, to $662 million, or 75 cents a share, from $608 million, or 69 cents, in the period a year earlier. Sales rose 11 percent, to $7.91 billion.The company, which has its headquarters in New York, is the first on the Dow Jones industrial average to report earnings this quarter.Aluminum prices rose 15 percent in the quarter and have more than doubled in the last five years. Citigroup says global demand may exceed supply this year.“The market environment is fundamentally very good,” Charles A. Bradford, an analyst at Soleil Securities in New York, said before the earnings were released. “Aerospace executives are pleading with the aluminum companies to boost output, and world economies, especially China, are doing well.”Excluding revamping costs and a loss of 2 cents a share from discontinued businesses, profit was 79 cents a share. That beat the 78-cent estimate of analysts.'"
"'07-04-11,'0','I remember — and it seems very strange to have to “remember” — the way these books and films seemed to stimulate and desolate me, the way they led me to a point from which I always had to find a way to turn back. The problem wasn’t trying to imagine the unimaginable. The problem was trying to realize that it had been carefully planned, as Thomas says, by “so many people with the outward appearance of steadiness and authority.”And yet somehow that was also the point of balance, the small consolation. It was possible to have at least a little faith that even the amount of cold, rational will it would take to start a nuclear war would almost surely prevent it from starting. This masked the fundamental insanity of it all, and it was a reminder — in case you ever forgot it — that the only possible recourse we could have was to elect the most rational, and the most human, leaders we could. Everyone else was simply out of the loop.In class, it occurred to me — and to my students — that Thomas’s piece could be rewritten about global warming. You could show how little we have done, and how far we have to go, to mitigate the worst effects of climate change, survey the technology that would allow us to hold back the rising oceans or cope with increasingly violent storms or provide us with alternative sources of energy. You could argue, as Thomas does in the case of the bomb, that “we need, in a hurry, some professionals who can tell us what has gone wrong in the minds of statesmen in this generation.”Except, of course, that climate change is not just about statesmen, not about the men with secret access codes and red telephones on their desks. It is about all of us, in every choice we make every day. I had the false but unspeakable luxury to grow up in the 1950s and 1960s, when it was possible to believe in the very otherness of the nuclear insanity that threatened the world.I look at my students and realize that they are in the first generation to grow up knowing that there is no otherness to the insanity that threatens us now. The insanity is what we call normal, and it is all our own. My students are better prepared for this than I am, because they have never been allowed to believe that the problem of climate change is merely a matter of politics at the highest level. They know it is their problem.We got this far in our seminar that night, possessed by the quiet outrage that Thomas so perfectly expresses and a little puzzled by the different burdens our generations seem to have assumed. And what I said, of course, is that for all the familiarity with which we turn to the problem of global warming and the responsibilities it thrusts upon us, the nuclear arsenal Thomas was talking about still exists. The numbers and the global politics have changed, and the capacity to handle radiation sickness and burns and trauma has grown. But too many weapons still stand, waiting.What it still comes down to, in Thomas’s words, is simply this. “Get a computer running somewhere in a cave, to estimate the likely number of the lucky dead.” This is a fear my students will have to grow into.'"

"'07-04-12,'1','With ""Voice of a Murderer,"" the unpredictable Korean director Park Jin-pyo returns to the docudrama form he employed so provocatively in ""Too Young to Die,"" his 2002 examination of septuagenarian sex. That film was judged unfit for public viewing by the Korea Media Rating Board, but this time the filmmaker is playing it safe: ""Voice of a Murderer"" arrives complete with its own public-service announcement.A fictionalized account of the unsolved 1991 kidnapping and murder of a 9-year-old boy, ""Voice of a Murderer"" unfolds relentlessly from the point of view of the distraught parents (Sol Kyung-gu and Kim Nam-joo), a popular news anchor and his religious, stay-at-home wife. The snatching of their son precipitates endless, repetitive scenes of parental hysteria, punctuated by calls from the shadowy abductor and abortive cash-delivery attempts. Despite the actors' valiant emoting, by the 44th day and the umpteenth call, it's déjà vu all over again.The movie's best scenes belong to the fabulously incompetent police, who bicker over the merits of voice-recognition software and bungle every stakeout. Though the director exploits Seoul's parking garages and alleyways to convincingly claustrophobic effect, ""Voice of a Murderer"" is an uninvolving melodrama more suited to the small screen than to the large.Written (in Korean, with English subtitles) and directed by Park Jin-pyo; director of photography, Kim Woo-hyung; edited by Kim Mi-joo; music by Lee Byeong-woo; production designer, Lee In-ok; produced by Lee Eugene; released by C J Entertainment.

"'07-04-12,'1','This debut feature from Justin Swibel, which spends a little over an hour observing a young man silently cleaning a palatial suburban estate, is so minimalist that at times it feels as if a prank were being played on the audience. And yet Mr. Swibel's style is so assured, and the film's rhythms are so precise, that it would be a mistake to dismiss ""Modern Man"" as a pretentious goof.The opening section shows Eric Becker, who plays the film's unnamed and only character, cleaning a swimming pool for several minutes. The rest of the film shows our hero taking out the trash and rearranging the garbage cans, putting ceramic frogs into fun patterns, rooting around inside the house and the garage and otherwise trying to master his environment. The alternating documentary-style close-ups and monumental wide shots better suited to a Hollywood epic subtly imply that we're watching a droll parable of mankind at ease after having subdued nature, yet still not feeling in control of it.If you go to movies expecting certain familiar elements — plot, dialogue, relationships and so forth — you'll want to throw popcorn at the screen. But if you tune into this film's rhythms, you'll leave the theater seeing the world with fresh eyes.Directed and edited by Justin Swibel; written by Eric Becker and Mr. Swibel, inspired by “Walden” by Henry David Thoreau; director of photography, Mr. Swibel; music by Johann Sebastian Bach and Johannes Brahms, performed by Sarah Seelig; production designer, Richard Tanis; produced by Mr. Becker and Mr. Swibel; released by Becker-Swibel Productions.

"'07-04-12,'1','It was a tepid endorsement for a medicine that Merck had once hoped would offer arthritis sufferers significantly better and safer pain relief. Indeed, Merck executives insisted for years that the company would seek to sell only medicines that offered substantial benefits over previous therapies.Even so, the F.D.A. forcefully disagreed with the company. And several panel members were withering in their criticism of Merck and its drug.Dr. David Felson, a panel member from Boston University, asked Merck’s presenters if they knew on average how many patients would die if Arcoxia were sold. Dr. Felson called the number a “treat to kill” ratio. Asked several times for such a number, Merck executives never answered directly.Dr. James Fries, a panel member and rheumatologist from Palo Alto, Calif., dismissed Merck’s argument that arthritis sufferers need a pain pill that is no different from the 20 others that they can already take. “A new drug has to have some reason” to use, Dr. Fries said.Agreed Martha Solonche, a panel member from New York, said: “The idea should not be that we need new drugs. The idea should be that we need better drugs.”Much of the day’s discussion centered around which of many older medicines should be compared to Arcoxia. In early studies, Merck compared Arcoxia with naproxen and found that Arcoxia was far more dangerous to the heart.So Merck switched to diclofenac, a pain medicine that is popular outside of the United States and is widely believed to be more dangerous to the heart than naproxen. The company claimed that its trials showed that Arcoxia was no more dangerous than diclofenac.But Dr. Robert B. Shibuya, an F.D.A. medical officer, said that if a million patients switched from diclofenac to Arcoxia, as many as 2,300 more could experience heart attacks, strokes and deaths.The F.D.A. and its advisers have become far less tolerant of risks in medicines that offer few life-saving benefits. Just last week, the F.D.A. announced that it had requested the withdrawal of Zelnorm, an irritable bowel drug. Studies had shown that Zelnorm might increase the risks of heart attacks and strokes slightly. The drug provides so few benefits, though, that the agency would not tolerate even a slight increase in risks.Today’s vote could end the last hopes that any new medicines similar to Vioxx and Arcoxia could get approved in the United States.Called Cox-2 inhibitors, these drugs — which include Celebrex — were originally developed in hopes that they would be easier on the stomach than ibuprofen and naproxen.But in safeguarding the stomach, the new drugs seemed to hurt the heart. And since almost no one would trade a heart attack for an ulcer, the underpinnings for the class of medicines seemed to disappear with Vioxx’s withdrawal.Celebrex, made by Pfizer, had $2 billion in sales last year. But the drug’s success is a triumph of marketing over medicine. Celebrex is considered no better or safer than older pills that sell for a fraction of its price.Arthur Levin, a panel member who is director of the Center for Medical Consumers in New York, said he wondered why the F.D.A. even called the advisory committee.“Based on the history and based on the evidence, my question is, why are we even having this meeting?” Mr. Levin said.The F.D.A. once used advisory committee meetings mostly to provide advice when the agency was uncertain of the right answer. Increasingly, the agency seems to be using the meetings to explain its decisions and even air some of its internal disagreements.At one point during today’s meeting, Dr. Graham engaged in a pointed debate with two other F.D.A. officials over past F.D.A. decisions. Dr. Graham said repeatedly that “F.D.A. is wrong” in its decisions about the relative risks of older pain pills. Dr. John Jenkins, director of the F.D.A.’s office of new drugs, called Dr. Graham’s characterizations “simply false.”'"
"'07-04-12,'1','“Days like today,” he added, “are among the hardest we face.”Last Thursday, after nearly two decades with the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Mr. Bush became the 51st agent killed on duty in its history. The authorities said he was fatally struck by a bullet from another agent’s weapon, which accidentally discharged outside a bank in Readington Township, N.J., as the agents were closing in on a group of four robbery suspects they had been stalking for weeks.An internal investigation into the chain of events that led to the shooting is under way.The four suspects — two of whom escaped but were arrested later — were arraigned on robbery and weapons charges on Monday at the federal courthouse in Newark. At least two other men believed to be part of a wider bank robbery gang that Mr. Bush and the other agents were pursuing are being sought in connection with a string of New Jersey holdups in South Brunswick, East Brunswick, Ocean Township and Piscataway.Mr. Bush, 52, joined the F.B.I. in 1987, working in it its office in , Mo. Four years later, he transferred to the agency’s Newark office and moved to Easton, Pa., where he lived with his wife, a son and a daughter. He was just five years away from reaching the agency’s mandatory retirement age of 57.Mr. Bush’s assignments took him overseas and around the country, and he was involved in some of the bureau’s most prominent cases. In 1998, he helped solve the murder of Dr. , an obstetrician in the Buffalo area who was killed by a sniper opposed to . He also led an evidence-collection team that investigated the bombing of the Embassy in , .Mr. Bush will be buried late today at a cemetery for fallen officers near Pottstown.Kevin Poole, 51, an activist and politician in Pottstown, said Mr. Bush’s hometown would always hold him in high regard.“He’s one of us,” he said. “We’re famous for Mrs. Smith’s pies and steel and things like that, but it’s a sad but honorable thing to have a man that served in this capacity. We’re really saddened but honored to have a guy like this come from our community.”In his eulogy, Mr. Mueller remarked that every F.B.I. field office has a wall of honor that lists the names of agents who have been killed in the line of duty.“In time,” he said, “we will add Barry’s name to that wall. And when we look up and see it, we will remember him as a dedicated professional and a devoted husband. We will remember him as a loving father and a loyal friend. We will remember him as a committed public servant and a courageous man, who gave his life doing what he loved most.”'"
"'07-04-12,'1','The White House conceded on Wednesday that political advisers to President Bush may have improperly used their Republican National Committee e-mail accounts to conduct official government business, and some communications that are required to be preserved under federal law may be lost as a result.Of the 1,000 White House officials who are political appointees, 22 — including Karl Rove, the chief political strategist — have Republican National Committee accounts that are supposed to be used only for campaign-related work. But recent revelations that some officials have used those accounts for Bush administration business, including discussions of a plan to dismiss United States attorneys, has prompted a Congressional investigation.On Wednesday, Mr. Stanzel said the administration had recently begun its own inquiry, and had concluded that its policy governing political e-mail accounts was unclear, that the White House was not aggressive enough in monitoring political e-mail and that some people who had the accounts did not follow the policy closely enough.As a result, Mr. Stanzel said, “some official e-mails have potentially been lost.” He said Mr. Bush had told the White House counsel’s office “to do everything practical to retrieve potentially lost messages.”Mr. Stanzel and a second administration official, who is involved in the review and was authorized by the White House to speak on condition of anonymity, said the White House was working with the national committee to discover what was missing and whether it could be retrieved.If e-mail messages have been lost, Mr. Stanzel said, they are most likely those sent before 2004. That year, the national committee adopted a policy of preserving e-mail sent by White House officials using its accounts.Democrats want to know whether White House officials intentionally used political e-mail accounts to escape scrutiny or circumvent the law requiring preservation of records. They reacted with suspicion on Wednesday.“This sounds like the administration’s version of the dog ate my homework,” Mr. Leahy said on Wednesday.“I am deeply disturbed that just when this administration is finally subjected to meaningful oversight,” Mr. Leahy said, “it cannot produce the necessary information.”Representative Henry A. Waxman, the California Democrat who is chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, has asked the White House to produce records relating to nongovernment e-mail accounts by April 18. But a Democratic aide, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the White House told Mr. Waxman’s committee on Wednesday that it would not be able to comply fully.Mr. Waxman issued a brief statement: “This is a remarkable admission that raises serious legal and security issues. The White House has an obligation to disclose all the information it has.”The issue grows out of the investigation into the dismissals of the prosecutors. E-mail messages provided to Congress in that inquiry showed that Mr. Jennings, the deputy political director, used his national committee address, ending in gwb43.com, to discuss them with aides to Attorney General Alberto R. Gonzales, including D. Kyle Sampson, who resigned amid the ensuing uproar.In January, an assistant to Mr. Jennings used a gwb43.com account to circulate a document discussing Democrats who are being singled out for defeat in 2008. “Please do not e-mail this out or let people see it,” the e-mail read, adding, “It is a close hold, and we’re not supposed to be e-mailing it around.”Other messages have brought scrutiny as well, including exchanges between Susan Ralston, a former assistant to Mr. Rove, and Jack Abramoff, the lobbyist convicted of corruption charges.Ms. Ralston apparently preferred to e-mail Mr. Abramoff and associates on her national committee Blackberry. In one exchange, Mr. Abramoff and a colleague worried about an e-mail message that wound up in the White House system.“Dammit,” Mr. Abramoff wrote, “it was sent to Susan on her rnc pager and was not supposed to go into the WH system.”At issue is how the White House complies with two seemingly competing laws. One is the 1978 Presidential Records Act, which requires the administration to ensure that its decisions and deliberations are “adequately documented” and that records flowing out of those decisions are preserved.The other is the Hatch Act, which prohibits federal officials from engaging in political business on government time.In order to comply with the Hatch act, the Clinton administration also permitted certain officials to hold dual e-mail accounts. But Bush White House officials say theirs is the first administration to operate in the era of instant communications.They say compliance has grown more complicated, and the White House rules have not kept pace with technology. As a result of their review, Mr. Stanzel and the senior official said the White House has put into effect a policy requiring, among other things, that officials with national committee e-mail accounts obtain permission for those accounts from the White House counsel’s office.The new policy also requires officials with two accounts to sign a “statement of understanding, saying they understand their obligations here and intend to comply with them,” the senior official said.Asked if he had any evidence that officials were intentionally using the national committee accounts to circumvent record-keeping requirements, Mr. Stanzel said he had not interviewed White House aides about how they made decisions on e-mail accounts.“I can’t speak to people’s individual e-mail practices,” he said. “I think the best we can say is were trying to do a comprehensive review.”'"

Saying the shield plan had set off a debate in Europe on whether the continent needed it, he said, “Russia is ready to take part in these discussions at all levels and in any format.” He said it was “unacceptable for anyone to use the Continent as their own strategic territory, and said an antimissile system “would fundamentally alter the Continent’s geo-strategic landscape.”'"

"'07-04-12,'1','But if the judges of the state Appellate Division in Brooklyn rule against him this time, Duke, who has been confined to the last cage on the east tier of Kennel No. 1 at the Town of Islip Animal Shelter here since Dec. 26, 2003, will probably soon eat his last biscuit. (His cage is adjacent to the small room where workers administer lethal injections to a dozen or so animals each week.)In some ways, legal experts say, Duke represents a new class of death-row dog. New York is among a dozen states that have changed laws over the past 10 years to make it possible to seize dogs from their owners and order them euthanized for biting other dogs.Ledy VanKavage, director of legislation for the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, said the stricter provisions reflected several factors: the rising numbers of pet dogs in American households, a growing concern about highly publicized vicious dog cases, and what she called the “evolving human-animal bond.”“The thinking goes: ‘My dog is a member of my family. If you attack my dog, you are attacking my family,’ ” she said.But Ms. VanKavage said this was flawed logic, noting, “Dogs are predators, after all.”The opposing view is in the papers filed on behalf of Duke’s former neighbor, Dominick Motta, who testified that on Oct. 23, 2003, Duke and his pit bull sister, Shelby, chased Mr. Motta’s bulldog, Daisy, and that Duke bit her.After a hearing, Duke was designated a “dangerous dog” by District Court Judge Madeleine A. Fitzgibbon of Suffolk County. His owners were ordered to keep him indoors or in a specially built kennel outdoors.When Duke got loose on Dec. 13, 2003, and again chased and bit Daisy, Mr. Motta, who then had three children ages 2 to 7, filed a follow-up complaint, which resulted in Judge Fitzgibbon’s order of destruction.“My client did not order the dog euthanized, a judge did,” Mr. Motta’s lawyer, John L. Belford Jr. of St. James, said in an interview. “And the judge’s decision was not designed to protect my client alone.”If Duke shares with some human death row residents the kind of mysterious personality that can look darkly dangerous to some and intriguing to others, he also shares what seems like the equanimity of one who is at peace with himself.“Watch this, I’m going to do some things that no aggressive dog would tolerate,” said Jeff Kolbjornsen, an animal behaviorist who attended the rallies on Duke’s behalf, on a visit to the shelter the other day.He clamped a hand over the dog’s mouth. He pushed him. He stepped on his paw, lightly. He gently slapped the dog’s head.Duke — whose skull is about the size of a baby watermelon, whose neck is roughly as thick as a man’s thigh, and whose mouth is ear to ear — sat on his hind legs, panting, his tongue extended just past the widest part of his wide chest. He nudged and then licked Mr. Kolbjornsen’s hand.“This is the nicest, calmest dog I have ever worked with, and I’ve been here seven years,” said Joanne Daly, an attendant at the shelter.In the brief filed with the court on Wednesday by Ms. Chaitoff, the lawyer for Duke’s owners, affidavits from Ms. Daly and from Matt Caracciolo, the shelter supervisor, were included praising the dog’s unflappable and friendly nature.But the main thrust of her argument is that the law under which he was prosecuted, Section 108 of the state’s Agriculture and Markets Law, which defines “a dangerous dog,” changed from the time of the attacks to the time of his trial.In 2003, the law defined a dangerous dog as one who attacks a person or attacks certain types of service animals, like Seeing Eye dogs. It was in 2004 that the law was expanded to include “companion animals,” pets like Mr. Motta’s Daisy.Therefore, Ms. Chaitoff said, in the eyes of the law, as well as his friends, “Duke is an innocent dog.”'"
"'07-04-12,'1','“There is no reason he shouldn’t do whatever he wants, even if it involves running for president of the United States,” Dr. Cheson said in an interview.Mr. Thompson, 64, is the latest in a string of political figures to disclose his cancer. Rudolph W. Giuliani and Senator John McCain, both Republican presidential candidates, are also cancer survivors, and Elizabeth Edwards, the wife of the Democratic candidate John Edwards, announced last month that her cancer had returned.As many Republicans voice frustration about their chances in the 2008 election, a cadre of political allies has been vigorously promoting a candidacy for Mr. Thompson. A sampling of polls in the last month have placed Mr. Thompson near the top of the Republican field.Representative Zach Wamp, a Tennessee Republican who is heading a movement to draft Mr. Thompson into the race, said the announcement signaled his seriousness about a candidacy.“There obviously was some urgency to letting everyone know,” Mr. Wamp said. “It looks to me like a person who may very well be running for president.”Dr. Cheson said he first examined Mr. Thompson on April 7, 2005, about six months after the former senator had noticed a lump under his jaw. Pathologists at the National Institutes of Health ultimately determined that it was a marginal zone lymphoma, which is an unusual type of a common cancer and affects the immune system.Dr. Cheson said that he could have withheld any therapy for months because the cancer was slow-growing. But Mr. Thompson chose to receive radiation to the neck “because he did not want to have a visible lump in his neck given his high profile,” Dr. Cheson said.When enlarged lymph nodes progressed in the groin and other areas, Mr. Thompson decided “he wanted to get the disease out of his system,” Dr. Cheson said. So in April 2006, Dr. Cheson prescribed Rituxan, a recently developed form of antibody drug that produced “a complete remission.”Mr. Thompson, who has weaved a career in the law, politics and acting, was elected to the Senate to fill Al Gore’s seat. Later, he won a full term, but did not seek re-election, leaving the Senate in 2003 for “Law & Order” on NBC.In recent weeks, advisers to Mr. Thompson have made inquiries in early voting states, but he has yet to pay a visit. Most Republican candidates are traveling to Iowa this weekend for the state party’s annual dinner, but not Mr. Thompson.“There is quite an interest to meet him and see him,” said Ray Hoffman, chairman of the Iowa Republican Party. “But his people got back to me and said he was still shooting ‘Law & Order.’ ”'"
"'07-04-12,'1','The conditions at Walter Reed, including moldy, rat-infested quarters and a bureaucratic maze that left severely injured soldiers in limbo for months, have become a symbol of the government’s broader failure to help troops injured in Iraq and Afghanistan. President Bush visited patients at the facility March 30 and said, “I apologize for what they went through, and we’re going to fix the problem.”A spokeswoman for Mr. Gates, Cynthia O. Smith, said Wednesday that he “welcomes the findings and believes our wounded warriors deserve the best treatment possible both as inpatients and outpatients.”The initial reports in February led to a shake-up of Army leadership. Army Secretary Francis J. Harvey fired Walter Reed’s commander, Maj. Gen. George Weightman, and replaced him with Lt. Gen. Kevin Kiley, the Army surgeon general.But critics said General Kiley had been told about the problems and failed to act. Mr. Gates then publicly criticized the Army’s response as inadequate, and both Mr. Harvey and General Kiley stepped down.Since then, the Army has moved aggressively to make improvements at Walter Reed. Patients have been moved out of the most squalid building. Some 28 new case managers have been added to help wounded soldiers navigate the medical system. A telephone hot line has been opened and information handbooks have been distributed to families of wounded service members.In remarks at Wednesday’s meeting, Mr. West, a former military lawyer who served as both secretary of the Army and secretary of veterans affairs under President Bill Clinton, strongly criticized the tortuous bureaucracy that assesses soldiers’ disabilities.“The horrors inflicted on our wounded service members and their families in the name of the physical disability review process simply must be stopped,” Mr. West said.He said the Army’s system currently requires four proceedings before an official board, causing delays and excessive paperwork and producing “inexplicable differences in standards and results.”“We can and must do better,” he said.Mr. West also said the panel concluded there was inadequate understanding of how to diagnose and treat the brain injuries that have become a signature of the Iraq war, where thousands of troops have been wounded by improvised explosive devices, and the mental effects of long exposure to the constant threat of attack.“We believe there is a need for greater and better coordinated research in this area,” he said.Under legislation introduced Wednesday by Senators Evan Bayh of Indiana and Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York, both Democrats, troops suffering from traumatic brain injuries would be kept on active duty, rather than being retired, so they would receive more medical attention.Steve Robinson, a longtime veterans’ advocate with Veterans for America, said he welcomed the findings of the review panel. But he said the panel should address the problems of discharged soldiers who were not getting V.A. benefits they needed.“What are we going to do about the thousands of people who have unjustifiably lost their V.A. benefits forever?” Mr. Robinson said. “It’s not enough just to fix the problems starting from the point that President Bush went to Walter Reed.”'"
"'07-04-12,'1','Mr. McCain’s presidential bid has been increasingly buffeted by his advocacy of the war. The senator faced criticism after he said during his trip to Baghdad last week that he was struck by the signs of improvement since his last visit there, and yesterday Democrats questioned his assessments of the war.“The idea that the situation in Iraq is improving because it only takes a security detail of 100 soldiers, three Blackhawk helicopters, and two Apache gunships to walk through a market in the middle of Baghdad is simply not credible or reflective of the facts on the ground,” said Senator Barack Obama of Illinois, a Democratic presidential candidate.Mr. McCain’s speech was as striking as much for the argument that he made for staying in Iraq as for the extent to which he assailed Democrats for wanting to end the war. Again and again, he portrayed Democrats as acting only out of political motivation, and said their ambitions were threatening the safety of troops on the ground in Iraq as well as America’s standing in the world. Three of the leading Democratic presidential candidates — Mr. Obama, John Edwards of North Carolina and Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York — have all endorsed various plans for American troop withdrawals.“Democrats, who deny our soldiers the means to prevent an American defeat, have chosen another road,” he said, speaking evenly in a still room to an audience that sat silently until he was done. “It may appear to be the easier course of action, but it is a much more reckless one, and it does them no credit even if it gives them an advantage in the next election.”He described Democratic leaders as smiling and cheering when Congress passed legislation setting a deadline for withdrawing United States troops from Iraq. “What were they celebrating?” he asked. “Defeat? Surrender? In Iraq, only our enemies were cheering.”At the same time, Mr. McCain said he was giving no thought to political considerations in embracing a war that, if unpopular with the American electorate in general, is in fact strongly supported by Republicans primary voters. “In Washington, Democrats view it as a political opportunity, and Republicans view it as a political burden,” he said at a news conference.Still, Mr. McCain seemed to lay the groundwork for an argument he could make later in this election cycle, should the escalation policy fail. He noted that he had long called for sending more troops into Iraq, the policy Mr. Bush adopted this year, suggesting that it might have worked better had more troops been sent in earlier.“Having been a critic of the way this war was fought and a proponent of the very strategy now being followed, it is my obligation to encourage Americans to give it a chance to succeed,” Mr. McCain said.Some Republicans have in recent weeks been advising Mr. McCain to move away from discussing his position on the war. With his speech here, Mr. McCain made clear he intended to do no such thing.“Our defeat in Iraq would constitute a defeat in the war against terror and extremism and would make the world a much more dangerous place,” he said. “The enemies we face there harbor the same depraved indifference to human life as those who killed 3,000 innocent Americans on a September morning in 2001.”WASHINGTON, April 11 (AP) — The troubled presidential campaign of Senator McCain is eliminating some nonsenior staff positions and cutting some consultants’ contracts. The campaign characterized the moves as “minor adjustments” that are part of an overall effort to revamp its fund-raising office and budgeting operation.Mr. McCain ordered a financial overhaul after he reported raising only $12.5 million from January through March, third behind his top Republican rivals, Mitt Romney and Rudolph W. Giuliani.'"
"'07-04-12,'1','From remarks yesterday to the cadets of the Virginia Military Institute in Lexington, Va.:“ I just returned from my fifth visit to Iraq. Unlike the veterans here today, I risked nothing more threatening than a hostile press corps. And my only mission was to inform my opinions with facts.We still face many difficult challenges in Iraq. That is undeniable. But we have also made, in recent weeks, measurable progress in establishing security in Baghdad and fighting Al Qaeda in Anbar province.To deny the difficulties and uncertainties ahead is an egregious disservice to the public. But as General Petraeus implements his plan to correct the flawed strategy we followed in the past and attempts to spare the United States and the world the catastrophe of an American defeat, it is an equal disservice to dismiss early signs of progress.And now we confront a choice as historically important as any we have faced in a long while.Will this nation’s elected leaders make the politically hard but strategically vital decision to give General Petraeus our full support and do what is necessary to succeed in Iraq? Or will we decide to take advantage of the public’s frustration, accept defeat and hope that whatever the cost to our security, the politics of defeat will work out better for us than our opponents?For my part, I would rather lose a campaign than a war.”'"
"'07-04-12,'1','“Once you make it to the top eight, you probably have as good a likelihood of being successful as anyone,” said Megan Mitchell, the senior associate director of entrepreneurial programs at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania (http://bpc.wharton.upenn.edu/index.html).Indeed, the process tends to be a demanding one, in which entrants must make it through a series of difficult levels. So, any plan that gets to the last phase — and even many that don’t — shows signs of being strong enough to have a shot at success in the real world.Most important, however, at every phase, participants receive constant feedback from classmates, professors, entrepreneurs and judges. So, it is no wonder that for the more motivated entrants those resources are where the real benefits lie.“Teams that are successful take advantage of every opportunity presented to them,” said Murray Low, director of the Eugene M. Lang Center for Entrepreneurship at Columbia Business School (http://www0.gsb.columbia.edu/entrepreneurship/initiatives/outrageous_plan).Sarah Chiles, director for programs at the Berkley Center for Entrepreneurial Studies at the Leonard N. Stern School of Business at New York University, said: “We provide the resources. It’s up to the students to make use of them” (http://w4.stern.nyu.edu/berkley/bpc.cfm?doc_id=6306).Consider Federico Sada. Last fall, in his second year at the Sloan School of Management at M.I.T., he and two partners entered the competition there, called the M.I.T. $100K Entrepreneurship Competition, with a plan for a company to sell “robotics for health care applications,” as Mr. Sada puts it. (He doesn’t want to be more specific.) They didn’t make it past Phase 1 (http://www.mit100k.org/).Nonetheless, Mr. Sada said, they learned a lot from the judges’ questions and made many changes as a result. For example, they rewrote their business plan to include a more detailed marketing strategy, fleshing out factors including what initial market segment to pinpoint, the types of media to use for advertising, and which distribution partners to pursue. They also were able to tap the insights of the contest’s sponsoring law firm. Thanks, in part, to that advice, they are already heavily involved in the start-up effort.Two team members recently traveled to China to explore development locations. “We now have a founding team, a much better idea how to approach potential partners and investors, and a better idea of the legal aspects of starting a business,” said Mr. Sada, who has not decided whether to join the company or return to his native Mexico. “We know that very good business plans may get rejected numerous times before making it.”Kenny Lao made it a lot farther up the road when he entered Stern’s competition. In his second year at the school, he was chosen as the first runner-up in 2004 for his concept, a low-price dumpling restaurant, receiving $15,000. But, he, too, points to the contest’s other advantages as being more important in going ahead with the concept after graduation. The advice he received from two judges, both venture capitalists who took an interest in his plan, proved to be particularly helpful, especially on company valuation and choosing a corporate structure.The first of his restaurants, called Rickshaw Dumpling Bar, opened in New York City in 2005. He just signed the lease for a second and is looking for two more.Of course, many entrants do not end up following through once the competition is over. Or, they may try, but eventually call it quits. Dr. Brent Ridge, for example, earned an M.B.A. from the Stern School in 2005 and was a runner-up that year. The concept, a company to be called Auricle, was to be an upscale nationwide hearing-aid retail chain. But after trying for a year, Dr. Ridge, who is a physician, and his partner were able to raise just part of the $500,000 they needed, and they put the plan on the shelf.“We decided the timing just wasn’t right,” he said.Still, according to Dr. Ridge, the skills he gained during the process have stood him in good stead at his current job: he’s opening the Martha Stewart Center for Living at Mount Sinai in New York, a new site for the outpatient clinical practice of geriatric medicine.If nothing else, the competitions are breeding grounds for sheer entrepreneurial excitement. At the recent gathering of the A. Lorne Weil Outrageous Business Plan Competition at Columbia, 32 teams of M.B.A. students gathered at a balloon-festooned conference room at Uris Hall to present their plans to a team of six judges. First, the 100 or so eager audience members watched a film of “elevator pitches,” in which competitors described their concept in no more than two minutes. Then, judges selected seven teams to make seven-minute presentations and answer questions.Jessica Feinstein came in third place for her KidsLunch.com, a provider of nutritious lunches ordered online. The year before she had also placed third, for a different concept: Sixteen Candles, an online one-stop-shopping site for Sweet 16 parties. While she has been offered a job, which she plans to start right after graduation, Ms. Feinstein says that eventually she may devote herself full time to Sixteen Candles; she and her teammate have been working on it all year.“My ambition long term is entrepreneurship,” Ms. Feinstein said. “What I learned from these competitions will help me achieve that goal.”'"
"'07-04-12,'1','WASHINGTON, April 11 — The director of national intelligence outlined a plan on Wednesday to make progress on significant problems still bedeviling American spy agencies nearly two years after a much-heralded intelligence overhaul.The plan unveiled by the director, Mike McConnell, and his deputies sets midsummer as the target for completing a number of initiatives, including mandating better collaboration among intelligence analysts, recruiting more first- and second-generation immigrants and slashing the time it takes candidates to navigate security procedures.Although Mr. McConnell praised the work begun by his predecessor, John D. Negroponte, the “100-day plan” he and his colleagues announced Wednesday included many initiatives that have been in the works for some time but that officials said had not progressed as far as they would have liked.Mr. McConnell spoke of a “sense of urgency” in carrying out the plan and said that a top priority was to assess the powers given to the director of national intelligence and determine whether the White House needed to clarify the position’s authority.“We’re going to examine it; we’re going to argue about it; we’re going to make some proposals,” he said.Last week, Mr. McConnell expressed frustration that although he ostensibly had control over the United States’ 16 intelligence agencies, he had limited hiring and firing power because most intelligence personnel answer to other cabinet members.'"
"'07-04-12,'1','Light regulation of hedge funds has worked well so far and seems appropriate given the benefits the funds provide to the financial system, the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, said yesterday.Speaking at New York University Law School, Mr. Bernanke stressed that the purpose of hedge funds — investment pools aimed primarily at wealthy investors and institutions — was to take risks.“Market discipline does not prevent hedge funds from taking risks, suffering losses or even failing — nor should it,” Mr. Bernanke said. “If hedge funds did not take risks, their social benefits — the provision of market liquidity, improved risk-sharing and support for financial and economic innovation, among others — would largely disappear.”Mr. Bernanke said the regulatory oversight applied to hedge funds was “relatively light” and acknowledged that their growing market share had raised concerns about possible systemic risks.“The failure of a highly leveraged fund holding large, concentrated positions could involve the forced liquidation of those positions, possibly at fire-sale prices, thereby imposing heavy losses on counterparties,” primarily very large commercial and investment banks, Mr. Bernanke said.“In the worst scenarios, these counterparty losses could lead to further defaults or threaten systemically important institutions,” he added.'"
"'07-04-12,'1','DHAKA, Bangladesh, April 11 — Murder charges were filed Wednesday against a former prime minister, Sheik Hasina Wazed, and more than 50 others as the country’s army-backed interim government entered its fourth month in power.Matiur Rahman Nizami, the leader of Jamaat-e-Islami Bangladesh, a religious party, and nine other leaders of the group were among those charged with killing activists during street campaigning on Oct. 28.Senior leaders of Sheik Hasina’s 14-party alliance were also among those charged with murder, because open rioting by the two groups had resulted in the deaths of 10 people, the police said. A court will hear the charges on April 22 and decide whether the case should go to trial, a court official said.Sheik Hasina, the prime minister from 1996 to 2001, is expected to cut short a visit to the United States to return home to be available for an investigation into separate charges filed this week by a businessman who says she extorted more than $400,000 from him while in power.Meanwhile, her longtime rival, Khaleda Zia, the leader of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party, who ended a five-year term as prime minister in October, is in virtual confinement at her home in Dhaka.'"

"'07-04-12,'1','Re “A Great Year for Ivy League Colleges, but Not So Good for Applicants to Them” (Education page, April 4):When my daughter was starting the college process at a competitive New York high school, we parents were invited to a talk by the dean of admissions from a highly selective university. He explained that colleges did not reject applicants; they accepted them.The problem is that almost all the students applying to selective colleges are qualified. The job of the admissions office, then, is to accept those students who fill the needs of the college — violists for the orchestra; potential French, anthropology and chemistry majors to ensure that all departments are represented; cheerleaders, chess players, altos and tenors, Westerners and Southerners. At some point all the slots are filled, with no places for the many other qualified applicants.In the seemingly arbitrary process of college admission, this explanation offered some rationale for the fact that SAT scores and high school grades were not the most significant criteria for college admission.In addition to the reasons you note for the high number of applications to the Ivy League colleges, there is another: the colleges aggressively solicit applicants. My son received several letters from one Ivy college and an application from another.He applied to both and, of course, was turned down by both. Although my son is an attractive candidate, I do not believe that he stood a serious chance of being accepted.The practice of contacting students is a marketing gimmick that is a cash cow for the universities and improves their admissions numbers.Shame on us for being taken in. Double shame on these universities for even suggesting that these students had a chance.'"

When tucked in a pocket or clipped to a belt loop, the HangTimer uses its “tri-axis accelerometer” to sense when the wearer has left terra firma and then measures each hundredth of a second aloft — otherwise known as hang time.The $99 device, available in stores or at www.hangtimer.com, logs the 10 best hang times and has five sensitivity settings for different sports. It also keeps track of the best and average hang times, and total accumulated time in the air.The HangTimer measures 2.5 by 3 inches, weighs 2.5 ounces and runs on two AAA batteries. In addition to collecting air time information, it can show the current time, date and temperature, and functions as a stopwatch with a lap timer. DropZone says the watch is water-resistant up to three meters. Shockproofing and a thick clip for attaching the watch to clothing are part of its design, to help the HangTimer live by the old maxim, “What goes up, must come down.” J. D. BIERSDORFER'"
"'07-04-12,'1','People close to Apple say that Mr. Aspinall is simply retiring. He turns 65 in October and had heart problems in the 1990s. Perhaps, having spent 46 years at the Beatles’ beck and call, he wanted to reduce his stress.For Mr. Aspinall, his work with the Beatles has been a handful — literally at first. He became the group’s road manager in 1961, which means that he has been part of the Beatles entourage longer than 50 percent of the surviving Beatles: Ringo Starr didn’t join the group until August 1962. (Mr. Aspinall came to the Beatles through Mr. Starr’s predecessor, Pete Best, and remained with them after Mr. Best was booted out.) When the Beatles were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, in 1988, George Harrison said that if anyone deserved to be known as the fifth Beatle, it was Mr. Aspinall.Having driven their van and hauled their equipment during the touring years, he became a sort of general factotum when the Beatles stopped touring in 1966. When the Beatles, holed up in the recording studio till the wee hours, needed anything from tea and sandwiches to arcane noisemakers, it was Mr. Aspinall’s job to round it up. The Beatles’ decision to start Apple Corps led to all sorts of turmoil, which was exacerbated by their growing internal divisions: not least among them, who should run the company.When the smoke cleared, Mr. Aspinall had been thrust behind a desk as chief executive officer and put in charge of a number of thankless tasks. First there was a stack of lawsuits among the Beatles themselves, and between the Beatles and EMI, that needed to be settled. That took 20 years.In the meantime Mr. Aspinall began assembling film clips for a history of the Beatles, originally to be called “The Long and Winding Road.” There was no possibility of doing much with this project until the lawsuits were settled, but when they were, in 1989, Mr. Aspinall revived the project and persuaded the surviving Beatles (and Yoko Ono, representing John Lennon) to sign on.The result was “The Beatles Anthology,” which turned out to be a huge trove of previously unreleased audio and video material as well as a book. The six discs of the CD “Anthology” (1995-96), taken together with the double CD “Beatles Live at the BBC” (1994), just about doubled the size of the Beatles official catalog.Mr. Aspinall’s accomplishments notwithstanding, Mr. Jones’s appointment may be a good sign. If there’s one thing the Beatles need, it’s someone savvy about reissues and how to properly remaster, package and market them.But another thing Apple needs is someone who comes to the job without the baggage of 46 years of subservience to the Beatles. We can probably assume that someone like Mr. Jones, who has been in the record business since the 1970s, did not just hear of Apple and the Beatles last Wednesday and knew all about how demanding the Beatles and their representatives can be. If we can assume that he has negotiated a measure of independence and freedom to navigate, his tenure may be refreshing.How many Beatles collectors, after all, have looked at the Sony Legacy reissues of recordings by the Byrds, Janis Joplin and Miles Davis and thought, “If only the Beatles archive were treated this way”?'"
"'07-04-12,'1','Mr. Bolaño has given his novel an odd tripartite structure. The first part, narrated by a young would-be poet, tells of his initiation into Belano’s Visceral Realist movement (a hit off the magic realism of García Márquez and others) and some graphically visceralist sex. It ends with his departure from Mexico City by car with Belaño, another writer, and Lupe, a prostitute fleeing her pimp. Belano is seeking traces of Cesárea Tinajera, a poet who long ago belonged to a similar movement and went off to the Sonora desert in the 1920s.Skipping to the third part: the party searches through a dozens of desolate Sonora hamlets. Belano’s (and Bolaño’s) visceral realism means evoking the obscure and humble — the children of darkness — while pillorying the children of light who flourish in the precincts of art, power and wealth.Eventually the searchers come upon Cesárea, who dropped her writer’s scrim to join the viscerally real world, harsh and extravagant by turns. Successively she had taken up with a bullfighter, taught school, sold herbs at country fairs and now, grown enormously fat, works as a village washerwoman. We read of a vengeful pursuit by Lupe’s pimp, and a bloody showdown where Belano becomes a knife fighter.Bulking between these two moving parts — one an amiable but distracted ramble; the other a tense, implacable advance — is a 400-page middle section, more than twice as long as the others put together.Narrative stops. Or rather, giving way to many dozens of mini-narratives, it replaces forward motion with a kind of tour, the kind Dante took of the Inferno. In this instance it is a tour of characters and attitudes in a Mexican literary scene that is a fools’ carnival of futility; one that Bolaño uses to suggest a more general futility of such scenes in Latin America and beyond.All manner of vanities and pretensions are on display: feuds, factions and privileged sterility. A voice or two cuts through the peacockery. Amadeo Salvatierra, a fellow poet of Cesarea’s back in the ’20s, is reduced to typing letters and petitions in the public square. He and Octavio Paz, he notes mordantly, are the only two Mexicans who actually make a living writing. Paz appears briefly, more trapped by his fame than relishing it. (I think that’s Belano’s point.)There is a portrait of expatriate writers living in squalid isolation in France. “I was suddenly overcome,” one says, “by the full horror of Paris, the full horror of the French language ... the sad, hopeless state of South Americans lost in Europe, lost in the world.”Interspersed through these innumerable, mostly brief narratives are a half dozen longer ones that tell of Belano in the years following the knife fight. Wandering in France and Spain he makes a series of appearances as a man of action (supernatural action in one story) coping, scrimless, with the world. Individually some of the episodes are powerfully suggestive; but there is the effect of a character making the same point too long and too often.This whole middle section suggests, sometimes hauntingly, Bolano’s theme of art’s sterility when shielded from life. Some of the book’s best passages are here; but the formlessness, the cascading miscellany, the pile of jigsaw pieces with some missing, the guiding box-picture (fictional as against intellectual) purposefully withheld: these can make the book, or at least the reader, founder. Many gleaming lights are displayed, but foundering nonetheless.'"

Mr. Fisk, who lives in Coal Valley, Ill., and is a vice president for technology at the Small Newspaper Group, a Midwestern publisher, is a do-it-yourselfer who built his outdoor screen.To Mr. Fisk, component parts, particularly surround sound, are what make backyard viewing special. Part of the fun, he said, is not knowing whether that barking dog is in your yard or on the screen.For those who are not technologically inclined and want to experience backyard theater on a budget, Mr. Fisk recommended using a projector with an integrated DVD player and speakers. Two such projectors are the Epson MovieMate 30s (epson.com), with a suggested price of $799.99, and the Optoma DV10 MovieTime (www.optoma.com), which has a suggested price of $999.99.For a low-cost inflatable screen, Mr. Fisk suggested Gemmy Industries’ 12 ½-foot Airblown movie screen (gemmy.com). It has a suggested price of $199.99 and is available at walmart.com. (Outdoor screens, like television screens, are measured diagonally.)For a permanent outdoor screen installation, Screen Innovations (screeninnovations.com) makes a motorized screen that can be installed under the overhang of a building. The 80-inch screen, with mounting kit, has a suggested price of $2,148 and is available at Best Buy.Cedia, the Custom Electronic Design and Installation Association, offers a ZIP code search at its Web site to find contractors trained by the organization in electronic integration and installation (cedia.org).

"'07-04-12,'1','Mr. Anderson said, “I recall you using that word.”“Oh, O.K.,” said Mr. Imus. “Well, then I used that word. But I mean — of course, that was an off-the-record conversation. But ——”The transcript was pure poison. A source very close to Don Imus told me last night, “They did not want to wait for your piece to come out.”For MSNBC, Mr. Imus’s “nappy-headed ho’s” comment about the Rutgers women’s basketball team was bad enough. Putting the word “nigger” into the so-called I-man’s mouth was beyond the pale.The roof was caving in on Mr. Imus. More advertisers were pulling the plug. And Bruce Gordon, a member of the CBS Corp. board of directors and former head of the N.A.A.C.P., said publicly that Mr. Imus should be fired.But some of the most telling and persuasive criticism came from an unlikely source — internally at the network that televised Mr. Imus’s program. Women, especially, were angry and upset. Powerful statements were made during in-house meetings by women at NBC and MSNBC — about how black women are devalued in this country, how they are demeaned by white men and black men.White and black women spoke emotionally about the way black women are frequently trashed in the popular culture, especially in music, and about the way news outlets give far more attention to stories about white women in trouble.Phil Griffin, a senior vice president at NBC News who oversaw the Imus show for MSNBC, told me yesterday, “It touched a huge nerve.”Whether or not Mr. McGuirk was hired for the specific noxious purpose referred to in the “60 Minutes” interview, he has pretty much lived up to that job description. He’s a minstrel, a white man who has gleefully led the Imus pack into some of the most disgusting, degrading attempts at racial (not to mention sexist) humor that it’s possible to imagine.Blacks were jigaboos, Sambos and Brilloheads. Women were bitches and, above all else, an endless variety of ever-ready sexual vessels, born to be degraded.The question now is how long the “Imus in the Morning” radio show will last. Just last month, in a reference to a speech by Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton in Selma, Ala., Mr. McGuirk called Mrs. Clinton a bitch and predicted she would “have cornrows and gold teeth” by the time her presidential primary campaign against Senator Barack Obama is over.Way back in 1994, a friend of mine, the late Lars-Erik Nelson, a terrific reporter and columnist at The Daily News and Newsday, mentioned an Imus segment that offered a “satirical” rap song that gave advice to President Clinton on what to do about Paula Jones: “Pimp-slap the ho.” Mr. Nelson also wrote that there was a song on the program dealing with Hillary Clinton’s menstrual cycle.So this hateful garbage has been going on for a long, long time. There was nothing new about the tone or the intent of Mr. Imus’s “nappy-headed ho’s” comment. As Bryan Monroe, president of the National Association of Black Journalists, told me the other night, “It’s a long pattern of behavior, and at some point somebody has to say enough is enough.”The crucial issue goes well beyond Don Imus’s pathetically infantile behavior. The real question is whether this controversy is loud enough to shock Americans at long last into the realization of just how profoundly racist and sexist the culture is.It appears that on this issue the general public, and the women at Mr. Imus’s former network, are far ahead of the establishment figures, the politicians and the media biggies, who were always so anxious to appear on the show and to defend Mr. Imus.That is a very good sign.'"
"'07-04-12,'1','Mr. McCain said Wednesday that his decision to give a speech embracing the war was devoid of any political calculation, even as he accused Democrats of acting out of politics in their handling of votes on troop levels and financing the conflict. Still, in giving such a speech when many Republicans have been advising him to turn to another subject, Mr. McCain could gain some political benefit for himself, and help the other candidates in his party.By going so far out on the pro-war limb, Mr. McCain has provided cover to his chief rivals, Mr. Giuliani of New York and Mitt Romney of Massachusetts. Both are supportive of the war and of the recent troop increase designed to bring Baghdad under control, but have not been nearly as muscular in their defense of the policy as Mr. McCain has been.“It does put McCain out there as a poster boy for backing Bush,” Andrew Kohut, president of the Pew Research Center, said, adding, “But in the end all of them are going to have to face the voters and answer for their views on the war.”There is a potential upside for Mr. McCain and others who back the war. With some military officers saying the troop increase is showing early signs of success in pacifying Baghdad, the Republicans’ strategy of aligning with the president could prove a daring but potentially fruitful move should the military strategy succeed.“If it works,” Professor Edwards said of Mr. McCain, “he gets to say, ‘I was right.’ ”And there are potential gains for Mr. McCain as he endures one of the roughest periods of his presidential campaign. For one thing, he noted pointedly in his speech that he had been an advocate of sending in more troops long before Mr. Bush embraced the policy. Should the new policy fail, Mr. McCain will almost surely note that he advocated an earlier and larger influx of new troops.As important, Mr. McCain’s firm declaration of his support of an unpopular war — in front of a gallery crammed with reporters and television cameras — could go a long way, some of his aides said, to restoring what had been his signature image from 2000, as an independent candidate willing to take unpopular positions no matter the political risks. Mr. McCain has watched that image get scuffed repeatedly this year as he has sought to rebuild his reputation with the very conservatives he defied last time, in 2000.Further, some recent critical reporting by newspapers and television networks of Mr. McCain’s trip to Baghdad last week has paradoxically been clearly welcomed in the McCain camp; one reason conservatives have been wary of him is because he is perceived as being close to the news media, and Mr. McCain made note of that in his speech.“I just returned from my fifth visit to Iraq,” he said. “Unlike the veterans here today, I risked nothing more threatening than a hostile press corps.”Beyond that, if the troop increase fails in its mission and Iraq continues its downward spiral, there could be an opening for an antiwar candidate in the Republican Party, or at least a candidate who is not so closely linked to administration policy as the current leaders are today. The obvious choice for that role is Senator Chuck Hagel of Nebraska, a decorated veteran who has been a consistent critic of the administration’s conduct of the war and who has not ruled out a run for the presidency.Views are mixed on whether the Republican primary electorate, which tends to be more conservative than the party as a whole, would support a candidate who breaks with his president and other leaders of the party on such a critical issue as the war. The Republicans tend to be more hierarchical than the Democrats and are inclined to rally around their president, particularly when he is in trouble.“Could a Republican with good credentials in terms of national security like Hagel come out and be critical of the president and have Republican primary voters respond to him?” Mr. Kohut asked. “It’s an open question, but he’d be walking a very delicate tightrope.”Mr. Kohut noted that his organization’s most recent poll of 1,503 Americans showed that 67 percent of Republicans thought the situation in Iraq was going well, compared with 36 percent of independents and 24 percent of Democrats. He said that figure did not leave a lot of room for an antiwar Republican.'"
"'07-04-12,'1','There are strong indications that Xuzhou Anying, a company with a main office that seems to consist of just two rooms and an adjoining warehouse here, possessed substantial supplies of melamine and even sought to buy quantities of it over the Internet.If melamine was intentionally blended into the wheat gluten, the findings could become a vast setback for agricultural trade between the United States and China, a country known for lax food-safety regulations.Stephen Sundlof, director of the Center for Veterinary Medicine at the Food and Drug Administration, said at a news conference last week that the agency had found unusually high concentrations of melamine in some batches of wheat gluten, as much as 6.6 percent.Xuzhou Anying, though, has tried to distance itself from the pet food recall in the United States, saying it does not manufacture or export wheat gluten and acts only as a middleman trading in agricultural goods and chemicals.In a telephone interview last week, the company’s manager, Mao Lijun, said he had no idea how wheat gluten with his company’s label ended up in the United States or how melamine, a chemical commonly used to make plastics, fertilizer and fire retardant, was mixed into a product that was eventually shipped there.Mixing melamine and wheat gluten is an unlikely practice here, according to local industry participants. Nonetheless, the company’s wheat gluten, tainted with melamine, ended up in millions of packages sent to the United States and Canada, leading to one of the biggest pet food recalls ever.ChemNutra, the Las Vegas-based company that acknowledges it imported the wheat gluten from Xuzhou for sale to pet food producers in North America, says Xuzhou Anying provided chemical analyses that showed no impurities or contamination in the packages of wheat gluten.Though some American scientists still question whether melamine is toxic enough to kill pets, the chemical is not approved for use in human or pet food in the United States. The F.D.A. says it may have led to kidney failure in some animals.The question that regulators, agriculture experts, and food producers and distributors may now be asking is whether other substances added to food imports can broadly contaminate the American food supply. The F.D.A. has said none of the contaminated wheat gluten leaked into human food.Here in Xuzhou, a metropolitan region of about 1.6 million, Mr. Mao turned away visitors to his office, declaring that he had nothing more to say on the matter.But there are indications that Xu- zhou Anying has manufacturing facilities in this area and also had access to melamine, which is sometimes used as a fertilizer in Asia. For instance, in recent months Xuzhou Anying has posted several requests on Web trading sites seeking to purchase large quantities of melamine.In a March 29 posting on a site operated by Sohu.net, a big Chinese company, officials of Xuzhou Anying wrote, “Our company buys large quantities of melamine scrap all year around.” There were also postings on several other trading sites like ChemAbc.net.A truck driver parked across the street from the company’s main office here said that Xuzhou Anying did operate manufacturing facilities and that he carried goods for the company.“Yes, they have a factory that makes wheat gluten,” said the man, who did not give his name and then telephoned the manager of Xuzhou Anying to check whether he could take visitors to the factory.On Tuesday, a reporter visited one of the facilities the truck driver identified in the village of Wangdian, about 10 miles south of company headquarters, but the gate to the building was padlocked.Storage sacks that appeared to hold grain or agricultural supplies were stacked outside the site in a vast wheat- and garlic-growing region here in Jiangsu Province.“They used to have their headquarters right over there,” said Chen Wei, a technology director at Nanjing Shibide Biologic Technology, an animal-feed company next door. “They’re pretty well known for their products.”Chinese regulators say they are now carrying out a nationwide inspection of wheat gluten supplies. American regulators have banned all wheat gluten from China, but there has been no domestic recall so far of gluten produced by Xuzhou Anying; the company’s wheat gluten can be used to make bread, baked goods and other food.Li Jundang, manager of Shandong Binzhou Tianjian Biotechnology, a wheat gluten producer in the city of Binzhou, about 200 miles north of here, said, “We never heard the news of tainted pet food.” Another gluten exporter, Shandong Rongchang, also said it was unaware of any problems with Chinese wheat gluten.Nor, it seems, have journalists in Xuzhou, who work under state censorship. “I didn’t know this news about Xuzhou Anying,” said Li Ning, news director at The City Morning Post, a daily newspaper here. “And even if we had heard about the news, we wouldn’t be able to report on it because it’s negative news.”Most experts on wheat gluten in the region said they had never heard of mixing it and melamine.“If you add chemicals into the wheat gluten, it is no longer called wheat gluten protein,” says Jiang Shaotong, a professor of food engineering at Hefei University of Technology in nearby Anhui Province. “I can’t think of any reason why melamine is needed in the production process.”Chinese customs officials do inspect or sample products planned for export, but those inspections are not thought to be stringent enough to detect the presence of every chemical or impurity.Asked about the investigation, a Chinese official working for the inspection and quarantine bureau declined to comment.But lax food-safety regulation and standards are a problem; food producers sometimes dye meats to make them look fresher and even sell fake milk powder for babies.This week, the Chinese government reported that an elderly woman died and 202 people were sickened at a hospital north of here after they consumed a breakfast cereal that turned out to be laced with rat poison.'"
"'07-04-12,'1','The problems in the subprime loan market will make it more difficult for borrowers to get mortgages and will cause home prices to fall this year for the first time on record, the National Association of Realtors said yesterday.The 2007 median price for an existing home probably will decline 0.7 percent, to $220,300, the first drop since the real estate trade group began keeping records in 1968 and probably the first decline since the Great Depression, said Lawrence Yun, an economist with the association, which is based in Chicago. The median price for new homes is projected to increase 0.4 percent, to $246,200 this year, the smallest gain since prices fell in 1991.Home purchases are being derailed as subprime lenders stop financing mortgages or go out of business, increasing inventory and weakening demand, Mr. Yun said. In the last 12 months, at least 40 subprime lenders have halted operations, gone out of business, or sought buyers as borrower defaults increased. On April 2, New Century Financial, the largest independent subprime lender, filed for bankruptcy protection.Subprime loans are made to borrowers with a history of missed payments, untested credit or heavy debt. Lenders to them charge higher interests rates than conventional mortgage companies because borrowers are more likely to default.“We’ve been getting reports from Realtors out in the field about home closings not going through at the last minute because of loan problems,” Mr. Yun said in an interview. “That impacts all homeowners because it affects prices.”New-home sales will probably decline 16 percent this year, to 904,000, while sales of existing homes are likely to fall 2 percent, to 6.34 million, from 6.48 million last year, the association said.'"
"'07-04-12,'1','At their last meeting, Federal Reserve officials agreed that more interest rate increases might be needed to tame rising inflation, though they also expressed concern that the economy could slow more than forecast.Minutes from the March meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, released yesterday, reinforced its position that inflation remained the biggest threat to the economy.Investors interpreted that yesterday to mean that a rate cut in the near future was unlikely.They had initially read the Fed’s statement from that meeting as encouraging the idea that an interest rate cut could happen within the next few months.Stock prices fell sharply after the minutes were released at 2 p.m. The Dow Jones industrial average lost 89.23 points, or about 0.7 percent, in yesterday’s session. The broader Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index fell 9.52 points, or 0.66 percent.The minutes showed that central bankers grappled with a growing uncertainty about which direction the economy was headed.'"

"'07-04-13,'1','BAGHDAD, April 12 — There is not much left in Baghdad that all its residents, Sunnis and Shiites, laborers and professors, consider their own. But the Sarafiya bridge, flung across the Tigris, tied the city together, literally and metaphorically.When the bridge was destroyed early Thursday morning by a truck bomb that collapsed a large section into the river, Baghdad mourned. People who had crossed the bridge every day to go to their jobs on the opposite side gathered on the riverbanks and stood weeping as if they had lost someone they loved.More people have died in many other bombings, but the destruction of the bridge struck at the city’s soul, at its lingering romance with an all but vanished image of Baghdad as a Paris of the Middle East.The steel bridge, which spans a stretch of river about 500 yards wide, was built by a British company at a time when foreigners from all over the world came to the city to study and work. Construction started in 1946, and it was completed in 1951, while the British-installed monarchy was in place. Built to accommodate train tracks as well as a roadway for cars, the bridge linked Baghdad’s two main rail stations and was one of the city’s main transit points across the Tigris.Most of the city is divided now, with the west bank of the Tigris predominantly Sunni and the east side predominantly Shiite. But so far the neighborhoods on either side of the Sarafiya bridge have been spared the worst of the violence, and both are still mixed as so much of the city once was.'"

"'07-04-13,'1','Mr. Rove uses several e-mail accounts, including one with the Republican National Committee, one with the White House and a private domain account that is registered to the political consulting company he once owned. Mr. Waxman said Mr. Kelner reported that in 2005, the national committee adopted a new policy, specifically aimed at Mr. Rove, which “removed Mr. Rove’s ability to personally delete his e-mails from the R.N.C. server.”Mr. Waxman also said he now had “serious concerns about the White House’s compliance with the Presidential Records Act,” a 1978 law that requires administrations to keep records of deliberations, decisions and policies. The congressman asked for an inventory of all communications by White House officials on nongovernment e-mail accounts.President Bush has directed the White House counsel’s office to try to recover any missing e-mail messages, but Scott Stanzel, the deputy White House press secretary, said it was unclear how much may have been lost. As to whether the missing e-mail related to the prosecutors’ dismissals, Mr. Stanzel said, “It can’t be ruled out.”Democrats were skeptical that any e-mail messages are truly missing.“We’re learning that off-book communications are being used by these people in the White House by using Republican political e-mail addresses and they say they have not been preserved,” Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont and chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said in an impassioned speech on the Senate floor. “I don’t believe that! You can’t erase e-mails, not today.”Richard M. Smith, an Internet security and privacy consultant in Boston, said Mr. Leahy’s surmise that the missing e-mail messages are preserved somewhere could be right. But he said there was no way to know without a thorough examination of all the computers the messages passed through.The Democrats’ investigation into the political e-mail accounts grows directly out of the inquiry into the firing of the United States attorneys. When the Justice Department turned over documents to Congress, they showed that, contrary to the White House’s initial assertions, Mr. Rove and Harriet E. Miers, the former White House counsel, seemed to be involved in planning the dismissals.The documents also revealed that a deputy to Mr. Rove, Scott Jennings, who works in the White House Office of Political Affairs, had used his Republican National Committee e-mail account, ending in gwb43.com, to communicate about the dismissals with a top aide to Attorney General Alberto R. Gonzales.The documents led to demands from Democrats for testimony from Mr. Rove and others; the White House agreed only to off-the-record interviews, and Democrats responded by threatening subpoenas.Now that Democrats are also demanding access to the political e-mail, the White House took steps on Thursday to use those latest demands as leverage to force Democrats to accept the White House’s conditions for making Mr. Rove and the others available.In a letter to Mr. Leahy and Representative John Conyers Jr., chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, Mr. Fielding, the White House counsel, said the administration was prepared to produce e-mail from the national committee, but only as part of a “carefully and thoughtfully considered package of accommodations” — in other words, only as part of the offer for Mr. Rove and the others to appear in private.Mr. Conyers, a Michigan Democrat, issued a tart reply: “The White House position seems to be that executive privilege not only applies in the Oval Office, but to the R.N.C. as well. There is absolutely no basis in law or fact for such a claim.”Senator Charles E. Schumer, the New York Democrat who is spearheading the Senate inquiry into the prosecutors’ dismissals, said the Fielding letter “can be summed up in three words: ‘We are stonewalling.’ ”Mr. Waxman, meanwhile, spent Thursday pushing the committee to release the e-mail. According to the congressman’s account of Thursday’s meeting with Mr. Kelner, the R.N.C. lawyer, as well as an interview with a Republican official familiar with the committee’s e-mail practices, the committee has a large cache of communications from White House officials. But there are none before 2005, when the committee “began to treat Mr. Rove’s e-mails in a special fashion,” Mr. Waxman wrote.The committee appears to have changed its e-mail retention policies twice, possibly in response to the investigation by a special prosecutor, Patrick J. Fitzgerald, into the leak of the name of a C.I.A. officer. When that inquiry began, in early 2004, the committee’s practice was to purge all e-mail from its servers after 30 days.But in August of that year, according to the Republican official, the committee decided that e-mail sent by White House officials would be kept on the server. Still, the change did not prevent White House officials from manually deleting their e-mail, and some, including Mr. Rove, apparently did. So in 2005, the committee took steps to prevent Mr. Rove from doing so.“Mr. Kelner did not provide many details about why this special policy was adopted for Mr. Rove,” Mr. Waxman wrote. “But he did indicate that one factor was the presence of investigative or discovery requests or other legal concerns.”Now the question is whether the missing e-mail can be recovered. Mr. Smith, the Internet security consultant, said e-mail ordinarily is initially stored in at least four places: in the “sent” file of the computer used to send the message; on the computer server of the sender’s Internet service provider; on the computer server of the recipient’s provider; and on the recipient’s computer.Even if the message is deleted, it may be recoverable from a computer’s hard drive. Eventually, however, the deleted file may be overwritten and lost, Mr. Smith said.“If you keep sending e-mails, it will probably get overwritten pretty quickly, and then it’s really gone,” he said.'"

"'07-04-13,'1','POTTSTOWN, Pa., April 12 — A bagpipe wailed. A siren droned. Police motorcycles revved. And within moments a procession was under way to carry Barry Lee Bush — the F.B.I. agent who was killed last week while staking out bank robbers in central New Jersey — to his final rest.Under somber skies, hundreds of officials from the Federal Bureau of Investigation, police departments as far away as Michigan and state and federal governments gathered at the Hill School here to remember Mr. Bush’s life, mourn his death and offer his family the universal embrace of law enforcement. Among the 3,000 mourners were Attorney General Alberto R. Gonzales; the F.B.I. director, Robert S. Mueller III; and Gov. Jon S. Corzine of New Jersey.In a eulogy, Mr. Mueller called Mr. Bush, the 51st agent to be killed on duty, one of the agency’s finest and “a model of everything the badge should represent.”“Barry’s death reminds us that the men and women of law enforcement put their lives on the line every day,” he said. “Each morning when they pick up their badges, they know there is a possibility they might not make it home that night. And that is where heroism lies: recognizing the risk, and choosing to accept it so that others don’t have to.”Even those who did not know Mr. Bush, a nearly 20-year F.B.I. veteran, seemed shaken by his death, which the authorities said was caused by a bullet from another agent’s gun as they swarmed the suspected robbers to thwart the latest planned holdup. The F.B.I. has refused to release the name of the agent whose weapon was fired or any detail about how it happened last Thursday in Readington Township, N.J.'"

By the time he rolled in a birdie on the par-5 No. 2, Johnson was three under. But his approach on the third hole dribbled off the back, leading to a bogey. He three-putted from 65 feet on the par-3 No. 4 for a second straight bogey.After a crowd-pleasing eagle on the par-5 No. 6, Johnson four-putted from 35 feet for a double-bogey 6 on the next hole.'"
"'07-04-13,'1','SAN FRANCISCO, April 12 — Apple Inc., the computer and consumer electronics company, said Thursday that the introduction of the new version of its flagship Macintosh OS X operating system would be delayed as much as four months because of quality issues.The company previously said the program would ship this spring.The uncharacteristic schedule slippage is particularly embarrassing for Apple, which is based in Cupertino, Calif., because it had previously poked fun at Microsoft’s struggles to complete its Vista operating system.Microsoft finally shipped the consumer version of its Vista operating system in January — roughly two years late — after starting the project over in the face of technology and security challenges. Since its release, Vista has generally received a lukewarm or negative reception from software reviewers.Last year at a conference, Apple’s head of software development, Bertrand Serlet, took the stage to illustrate how a number of Vista’s features were similar to those in Apple’s current operating system, known as Tiger.“If you can’t innovate, I guess you just imitate,” he said. “But it’s never quite as good as the original.”'"
"'07-04-13,'1','It was a tepid endorsement for a medicine Merck had once hoped would offer arthritis sufferers significantly better and safer pain relief. Indeed, Merck executives insisted for years that the company would seek to sell only medicines that offered substantial benefits over previous therapies.The F.D.A. forcefully disagreed with the company, and several panel members were withering in their criticism of Merck and its drug.“There is nothing special about this drug that would warrant giving it to patients and putting them at risk of cardiovascular death,” said Dr. David Felson, a panel member from Boston University.Dr. Felson said the testing of Arcoxia and similar medicines should be stopped until companies could create drugs with fewer heart risks.Other panelists said patients needed better arthritis drugs, not more of them.Much of the day’s discussion centered on how Arcoxia compared with older medicines.In early studies, Merck compared Arcoxia with naproxen and found that Arcoxia was far more dangerous to the heart. So the company switched to comparing it with diclofenac, a pain medicine that is popular outside the United States and is widely believed to be more dangerous to the heart than naproxen. The company claimed that its trials showed that Arcoxia was no more dangerous than diclofenac.But Dr. Robert B. Shibuya, an F.D.A. medical officer, said that if a million patients switched to Arcoxia from diclofenac, as many as 2,300 more could experience heart attacks, strokes and death.The panel discussed whether it was fair to penalize Merck’s drug for having a heart risk when older medicines like diclofenac that continue to be sold seemed to have similar risks.Dr. John Jenkins, director of the Office of New Drugs at the F.D.A., said the science had changed.“We didn’t know about these cardiovascular problems back in the ’80s and ’90s” when the older drugs were approved,” Dr. Jenkins said. “Some could question, Should all those other drugs still be out there?”The F.D.A. and its advisers have become far less tolerant of risks in medicines that offer few life-saving benefits.Thursday’s vote could signal an end to the possibility of any new medicines similar to Vioxx and Arcoxia being approved in the United States.Called Cox-2 inhibitors, these drugs, which include Celebrex, were developed in hope that they would be easier on the stomach than ibuprofen and naproxen. But while they safeguarded the stomach, they worsened heart risks. Since heart attacks are far more frequent and deadly than ulcers, the reason for the class of drugs disappeared.Arthur Levin, a panel member who is director of the Center for Medical Consumers in New York City, said he wondered why the F.D.A. even called the advisory committee together. “Based on the history and based on the evidence, my question is why are we even having this meeting?” Mr. Levin said.A Merck spokeswoman, Kyra Lindemann, said the company was “disappointed in today’s outcome.”“We continue to believe that Arcoxia has the potential to become a valuable treatment option,” Ms. Lindemann said, adding that Merck would continue to sell the drug outside the United States.'"

"'07-04-13,'1','LONDON, April 12 — The company that manages the Beatles’ commercial interests and the EMI Group, which holds the rights to the band’s recordings, said on Thursday that they had settled a dispute over royalties, renewing speculation that a deal to release the Beatles’ music in digital form might be near.The Beatles are among the last big holdouts from digital music services like iTunes from Apple Inc.Expectations of a deal were raised last week when Steven P. Jobs, Apple’s chief executive, traveled to London for a news conference with EMI executives. The announcement, however, was that EMI had agreed to make its catalog available on iTunes without copy protection, with Beatles’ songs being excluded.Mr. Jobs also added grist to the rumor mill in January, when he introduced the new iPhone. At a news conference, he demonstrated the device’s abilities by displaying Beatles album covers and playing the song “Lovely Rita.”Elizabeth Freund, a spokeswoman for Apple Corps, the company that manages the Beatles’ affairs, said the settlement with EMI, first reported in British newspapers on Thursday, was not directly related to any talks about digital downloads of the Beatles’ music.“Every little bit of news on this gets talked about over and over,” she said.Still, Eric Nicoli, chief executive of EMI, has said the company hopes to be able to sell the Beatles’ songs online soon. And recent legal developments, including the settlement in February of a trademark dispute between Apple Inc. and Apple Corps, appeared to clear some of the hurdles.'"
"'07-04-13,'1','It is appalling that John McCain would claim that it is Democrats “who deny our soldiers the means to prevent an American defeat” (“McCain Says Democrats Play ‘Small Politics’ Over Iraq,” news article, April 12).The responsibility for four years of failure to provide enough troops to secure Iraq, to adequately equip and train troops on the ground, and to pursue all diplomatic avenues available to win lies squarely with the Bush administration and the Congress when it was controlled by the Republicans. It is they who mismanaged this war of choice for so long.John McCain, in his support for an open-ended military commitment in Iraq, argues that “America has a vital interest in preventing the emergence of Iraq as a Wild West for terrorists, similar to Afghanistan before 9/11.”His position makes clear that Iraq was not a Wild West for terrorists before 9/11. What happened to create this risk between 9/11 and the present? The answer is the Bush administration’s invasion and its aftermath.Senator McCain’s campaign to lead us into the future will lack credibility until he acknowledges the truth about the past, including his failure to ask the right questions at the right time.

"'07-04-13,'1','In recent years a few American orchestras and opera companies have tried introducing video elements to the experience: close-ups of the conductor, or the solo oboist, or the soprano singing Mimi.These tentative experiments must seem antiquated to the young musicians and composers at the Juilliard School’s Music Technology Center. For seven years the center has presented annual concerts of new works involving up-to-date computer and technological resources. This year’s free three-day festival of electronic and interactive music, waggishly called “Beyond the Machine 7.0,” and subtitled “The Eye/Ear Collaboration,” began on Wednesday night in the Clark Studio Theater, a black-box space in the Rose Building at Lincoln Center.Projected visuals were crucial elements of every piece. So as the pianist Vicky Chow played the opening work, “Digits” by Neil Rolnick, close-ups of her nimble fingers and leaping hands were projected in split-screen images. But as the music built in intensity, the projection design by Luke Dubois became increasingly elaborate, with images subdividing into neat rows of mini-screens and blurry abstractions.Though the images were kind of cool, I was much more riveted by Mr. Rolnick’s teeming piece and Ms. Chow’s brilliant playing. The music began with churning eruptions in the piano’s low register, then built into spiraling volleys and skittish “wrong note” arpeggios. Snippets of dance rhythms and an elemental theme, like some Dies Irae motto, intruded. As Ms. Chow played, isolated pitches, brutal chords and rippling passages were picked up by microphones and processed through the computer to extend and enhance the live piano sounds. It all made for an exhilarating interactive piece.Ms. Chow also performed “Hetz,” a shorter work with audio composition by Andreas Weixler and visual composition by Se-Lien Chuang. At first the work sounded uncomfortably close to New Age meditation music, with ocean waves and whooshing winds and images to match. It was rescued in its middle section by a pugnacious atonal outbreak on the piano.Yui Kitamura’s “Awaumi” for solo violin, with projections by Mr. Dubois, took musical phrases that could be heard as far-out Ravel and, through a computer, wildly fractured them. Patrick Doane was the compelling violinist. The projections, with shadowy images of Mr. Doane against swirling watery backdrops, were rather corny, even though this handsome violinist looked good in close-up.'"
"'07-04-13,'1','Who watches more television — the business traveler or the sports fan?The Nielsen Company, the longtime arbiter of television viewing, may soon suggest an answer.Beginning in September, Nielsen will release national ratings for television viewing outside the home in places like bars, hotels, gyms and offices, the company announced today. For decades, Nielsen has rated television viewing based only on what viewers in its panel watch while they are home. The moment those viewers traveled or went to the gym, however, any television they watched was not recorded.For some types of television programs, the new ratings may provide a significant boost. Sports fans, for example, often watch games in restaurants or bars, and business people often watch the news in airports, their offices or at hotels.Television networks like ESPN, CBS and CNN have complained for years that out-of-home viewing was not counted because they are generally paid by advertisers only for the viewers counted by Nielsen. The move by Nielsen is a step in the rating company’s larger plan to measure television viewing everywhere it occurs, whether on televisions, computers and mobile devices.“Nielsen has a mandate to follow the video wherever it goes,” said Sara Erichson, executive vice president for client services at Nielsen Media Research North American, a unit of the Nielsen Company. “A lot of where video is going is outside the home.”'"
"'07-04-13,'1','The firings also come at a time when deal making is rampant, and many executives and companies have succumbed to the allure of being bought out.It is uncertain whether the two executives had hoped simply to put Dow Chemical in play or had sought to be part of the management of an acquired company.The move by Dow Chemical came just two days after its chief executive, Andrew Liveris, publicly denied a report in a British newspaper that it was in talks about a sale.Frank J. Mitsch, an analyst with BB&T Capital Markets who has covered Dow Chemical for years, said: “I’ve never seen anything like this in chemical land: Liveris making all these denials, while unbeknownst to him, two of his own heavy-hitters are holding talks.”Shares of Dow Chemical jumped nearly 5 percent on Monday after the report on a possible buyout, only to fall 2 percent on Tuesday’s denials, Yesterday, the shares rose 2 percent.How Mr. Reinhard, a Dow executive for more than three decades and once considered a contender for the chief executive job, and Mr. Kreinberg, who ran the company’s most profitable business, plastics, engaged in covert negotiations over the fate of the company is likely to become a much talked about tale on Wall Street.People involved in the discussion said that both men engaged in talks with JPMorgan Chase about the prospect of a buyout and encouraged the bank to seek possible bidders.JPMorgan worked on the project for at least a month, running numbers on the business based on public filings and eventually reaching out to several private equity firms including Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Company and the Blackstone Group, these people said. The firms held meetings and briefly crunched some numbers, but their interest soon cooled.JPMorgan was never formally retained by Dow Chemical to pursue a sale, and it is unclear whether Mr. Reinhard and Mr. Kreinberg represented themselves to the bank as authorized to engage in such preliminary discussions.Yet the private talks soon became public on Feb 25, when The Sunday Express reported that three private equity firms — Kohlberg Kravis, Blackstone and the Carlyle Group — were ready to bid $54 billion for Dow.The report set off a firestorm at Dow Chemical’s headquarters in Midland, Mich.Mr. Liveris called JPMorgan’s chief executive, James Dimon, to find out what was happening, people involved in the discussions said. When Mr. Dimon learned that Mr. Liveris was not interested in a buyout, it stopped work on the project.An executive from Blackstone called Mr. Liveris to tell him that the firm was not involved with a buyout proposal.On Sunday, however, The Sunday Express ran another report of a possible buyout, this one specifying that Dow Chemical was about to be bought for $50 billion, with much of the money coming from the Middle East, in particular Oman. The company had had enough.On Monday, Dow, which usually does not comment publicly on deal speculation, issued a statement denying that it was in play. And on Tuesday, the chief executive, Mr. Liveris, appeared on CNBC to reiterate the denial. Dow also decided that it was time it found out exactly why the talk persisted.“This was becoming too disruptive,” Christopher R. Huntley, a Dow spokesman, said. “It was unsettling for our employees and for local communities, and the share price volatility was not good for shareholders.”According to Mr. Huntley, high-level executives and directors started calling their contacts in the financial world, trying to trace the rumor to its source. One of them struck gold:“Someone in a position to know pointed at Romeo and Pedro,” Mr. Huntley said.Mr. Reinhard and Mr. Kreinberg did not return repeated phone calls. In a brief conversation with The Associated Press, Mr. Kreinberg said: “The behavior of the company is very unusual, and the accusations have absolutely no substance and are highly damaging to my reputation after 30 years of employment.”Representatives for JPMorgan, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and Blackstone all declined to comment.Mr. Reinhard will remain on the board until a vote by shareholders, the company said yesterday.Mr. Reinhard is no stranger to deal making, As chief financial officer, he helped engineer a number of the company’s deals, notably the $11.6 billion acquisition of Union Carbide in 1999.Yet the next year, he was passed over to be the successor to the chief executive, William Stavropoulos, in favor of Michael D. Parker.Both Mr. Reinhard, 55, and Mr. Kreinberg, 61, spent their entire careers at Dow Chemical and both are natives of Latin America: Mr. Reinhard is from Brazil and Mr. Kreinberg is from Argentina.Mr. Kreinberg is a director of Oman Petrochemical Industries, a joint venture Dow formed with the government of Oman and the Oman Oil Company. Mr. Huntley would not say whether the source said the two men had said they were talking with corporate authorization.'"

"'07-04-14,'0','Q. Well how long did General Petraeus tell you the surge needs to last?A. He didn't say how long. But he's a smart enough general and so is Odierno. And you know this, Michael. They're smart enough to know whether we are showing progress or not. And it won't be gauged on the number of suicide bombers. Ask the Israelis how hard suicide bombers are to stop. They completely seal their borders with the West Bank and Gaza and they still get — they still get suicide bombers coming across.Q. What will it be gauged on?A. Whether the Iraqi military is able to take over more and more of the responsibilities and whether these areas are kept into an environment of security so that the political and economic life can move forward. It's the classic — and I hate to insult your intelligence and I know I do that when I say some of these things and I apologize — but the fact is it's the classic counterinsurgency strategy which has either succeeded or failed in the past. Sometimes the best counterinsurgency strategy doesn't work. It fails. But at least we've now got the right strategy. I know that these answers are probably too long and I apologize.Q. No, they're not too long.Q. They're not too long at all. Feel free to express yourself the way you want. We're going to run a transcript on the Web.Q. You know, a point that General Petraeus alluded to in a recent interview on the Lehrer Newshour was that the timelines for accomplishing things in Iraq are rather long, given the difficulties there and also counterinsurgency is inherently a time-consuming operation if you try and protect and win over a population. Expectations in Washington are that results should be achieved in the near term. How can you reconcile these two if you sort of —A. Well, in a way it's a matter of leadership, to explain to the American people where we are, where we have — what progress or lack of progress we have accomplished, and probably keyed to some degree on the level of American casualties as one of the measures of whether we are making progress or not. I think if the American people can be shown signs of progress and improvement in the situation and at the same time be made aware of the consequences of a set date for withdrawal, then I think that we could probably maintain at least a significant amount of support on the part of the American people. Is it long and hard and tough? Yes. One of the worst aspects of this conflict was all this rosy scenario, few dead-enders, last throes, that raise the expectations of the American people to a unrealistic degree. I never begin a conversation about Iraq without saying it's long and hard and tough. It will not be easy.But I also try to point out what the stakes are here. And my criticism of the Democrats, with the exception of Joe Biden, who says they would kind of break up into different entities, which I think is totally unrealistic, as most experts do, you know, you would, as somebody wrote the other day, you'd have to separate bedrooms — Sunni and Shia married to each other. They offer no alternative. They offer no scenario as to what happens next.Q. When do you think you'd have to show results?A. I don't know the answer to that. I don't know the answer. I know that, for example, I've been a bit surprised at the level, at the amount of progress that they've achieved with only two, and now three, of the five brigades. I've also been not surprised but sorry that some of this activity has gone outside of Baghdad, particularly into Diyala Province. And some of that, I think, has motivated this decision on the extension of the troops over there, which I'm sure was not an easy decision. But in a perverse sort of way I applaud it because Petraeus told us at a hearing: He said, If I think I need more, I'm going to ask for more. And the president has told me I'm going to get more. And so, you know, and I'd like to P.S. — postscript what, again, you already know: There's only one thing worse than an overstressed and fatigued army and that's a defeated army.Q. I'd like to just ask two questions and Adam will jump in.If you were elected president, you'd have to deal with two — either one of two kind of scenarios. One would be that the surge had — was a success to some degree.Q. Militarily in that there had been some . . . political reconciliation in Iraq. If that was the state of affairs when you became president, how would you see the future of American forces in Iraq? What would be the role of American troops — a future role of American troops in Iraq? How many would there be there? You know, where would they be? What would they do?A. A scenario that I would envision is that they gradually withdraw to their bases. And the Iraqis take over the day-to-day security requirements of the country. There can be times when they'd be called upon both for air power and even other cases where the ground power as well. But then eventually leave. But let me just expand that a little bit to you. Suppose that we get an environment of security in great parts of Iraq. Then you're able to rebuild the infrastructure. Then the oil revenues begin to flow higher. Then you begin to process — have a process of economic restoration and development. All this is dependent upon an environment — an atmosphere of security. And then you could see other countries in the region contributing — and out of the region.I recently had a meeting with Musharraf. Musharraf said Pakistan, Indonesia and Malaysia would be glad to come in and help out in many respects, if you had the secure environment. Clearly, if you could get this environment into some kind of control, that Jordan, Egypt and Syria — excuse me, Jordan, Egypt and Saudi Arabia have an interest in helping out in making sure that you get progress in a broad variety of ways. So the scenario that I would envision — and I will admit it is the optimistic scenario — is that you get the secure environment; you begin to have security around the oil facilities; you restore more electricity to Baghdad and other parts of the country. And then you get other countries involved as well and you are able to, because of increased oil revenues, have an efficient way of getting that money to the people and to a sustainable economic development.Q. But realistically, under the optimistic scenario, you're going to have, at least at first, a substantial American presence —Q. And a fairly gradual drawdown. How many forces did you envision and how long do you think . . . drawdown?A. I don't know the answer to that, Michael. I've been a pretty good armchair general, a guy who always stays away from — from any possibility of getting injured. So I can't predict that. But I know that we will be able to know whether they are progressing or not. And I have no illusions. I have no illusions about the length of time that the American people will remain patient.Q. Well let's turn go the other scenario. Let's say — the Bush administration has allowed that the surge strategy may not work.Q. Especially since it depends on the actions of others — the Iraqis to reconcile. And I think you yourself in some of your statements pointed out that plans often are, you know, don't survive the first contact. So let's say the surge doesn't produce the results that are hoped for. The Iraqis don't reconcile. You don't see the kind of steps that you're hoping for on the part of the Iraqi leadership. What's the next course of action that you would take as president? What's Plan B?A. I have no Plan B. If I saw that doomsday scenario evolving, then I would try to come up with one. But I cannot give you a good alternative because if I had a good alternative, maybe we could consider it now. Every alternative that I know of that is keyed to a date for withdrawal, which that would dictate, is chaos in the region. And genocide. And then the other nations play. And it emboldens the Iranians and the Syrians. And then you see more trouble in Lebanon. And the Israelis come under more and more attacks because of the emboldenment by being emboldened by our failure. So I'd love to tell you, whoa, then what we have to do is move outside the border, say to Kuwait, and parachute in when there is some kind of a problem arises. Please.A. You can't. The fact of modern warfare is that you can't parachute into places. You can't go in without a solid base of support if you're going to be engaged in heavy fighting. We're having trouble doing things with the situation the way it is, much less having people based outside of Iraq.Q. Well what about some of the Democrats, like Senator Clinton, talk about this strategy of a containment within the borders of Iraq, which would posit a limited number of forces, maybe in Kurdistan and Anbar, with a limited mission of engaging in counterterrorism activity. What's wrong with that approach?A. That assumes somehow that the place hasn't descended into chaos. And again, most every military expert that I know believes that it will.A. Well, if we can't do it —A. To do what? To be rocketed? To be rocketed in their bases? To be — well, look, if you can find the credible military experts who I admire and respect that say that that has any viability, I would very seriously consider it. The only viable strategy that I know of is the strategy we are pursuing now. So I know that many other Senators have many other scenarios as to what should be done. I don't think they're credible.Q. There's containment within the borders of Iraq, there's containment outside the borders of Iraq, there's partition, which you've already addressed.Q. And I think the last one I think that's been put forward was putting the emphasis on training the Iraqis and embedding trainers, standing back from a large conventional force. You know, maybe not have a combat role in Iraq but purely a training role. That's been put forward as an option.A. I'd be very reluctant to send young men into a country where there is chaos and tell them that they're going to be trainers.Q. When General Abizaid I think was testifying I'm pretty sure you once made, you were arguing against the status quo approach.Q. You and Senator Graham. And saying status quo was not the option. You were saying if we weren't, and you made a point that if we weren't going to increase, and you spoke for a different strategy perhaps, you know, under those circumstances the best thing to do would be to withdraw. Are there circumstances where, if the surge didn't work, you don't like these other options, withdrawal is not a good option but maybe it would just become a recognition of reality in a sense that why expend American lives in pursuit of other strategies that aren't effective?A. Well I think in our hearings when I was arguing against the status quo was that I was arguing that the eventual result would be U.S. withdrawal because we couldn't succeed. I mean democracies won't support continuous failure, unending failure. I think that's what I was —Q. I think I heard you say in one of the speeches that at a certain point you reach a point where we're just getting status quo you're not going to send more Americans in to die.A. Yeah. Yeah. If the strategy has failed. If the strategy has failed, which it was and which I had pointed out for three and a half years, then continuing of a failed strategy is a waste of additional lives. I think that's pretty obvious.Q. Michael's point I think is if you come in in two years as president and find that the surge has failed —A. Well, at that time, if I find that it has failed, then we would obviously have to consider what the other options are. But I don't know what those are. I don't know — If I knew of a good option to the present one I would probably give it serious consideration now. I simply don't know of one. And when I ask military experts I say, Hey — I just asked Gen. Jim Jones, one of my dearest friends, What's the option? I don't know. I don't know.Q. . . . maybe the option is at a certain point it's not worth losing any more American lives then you pull out. Is that at all an option to you?A. Yeah, but you have to understand that that pullout is different from the Vietnam War where we pulled out and came home. We pull out, they pull after us. I mean then we have a whole new set of challenges to our nation's security, including chaos in the region.Q. I guess another way of asking it is under what circumstances would you consider withdrawal?A. The this strategy fails, obviously, you have to then examine what your other options are. But the political reality is, and I understand it, that Americans will not support a continued failed strategy for an unlimited period of time. And we have to show progress, otherwise that patience will run out sooner rather than later.Q. Could you see sending more troops? My impression was you thought early on that we needed more —A. I always believed that. But again, I looked General Petraeus in the eye, he said, If I need more troops I'll ask for them, and if I think this strategy is failing I will tell the president and the American people. I have great trust in him. And when he tells me that — And that's why we have just seen this extension of 15 months to the military, because he said, Look, I'm going to have to have some more troops over there. That's why they're sending a couple more of these guard brigades also.Q. Do you think the current increases are sufficient? Or as president would you increase the number of troops in the military?A. I would evaluate it. But at first blush I would like to see — I've always called for 90,000 or 100,000 additional Army and Marines. But I think that part of that would be dictated by the situation in the world too. If we settled the North Korean issue, which is by no means clear to me, if things progress then maybe not. But if things continue to deteriorate, not just in the Middle East but in other parts of the world, then I might have to ask for more. But I'd evaluate it at the time. It's going to take us a while to get this build-up, the increase that we're already embarked on. So I'd like to see the effects of that before piling on to that.Q. One thing that you haven't mentioned is the utility of discussions with Iraq's neighbors — the Iranians, the Syrians, maybe the Sunni-Arab states, the Turks — as to how that might or might not contribute to stability in Iraq. What your sense as to what might be accomplished through diplomacy?A. I think that it's very clear, and if we can show the kind of progress then you will see greater participation on the part of at least the friendly Arab states — Jordan, Egypt, Saudi Arabia. I think the Syrians and the Iranians both have been emboldened by our failure. After the initial victory they couldn't have been more cooperative and as we have failed they have become more and more belligerent and active.I just read again today that the Iranians are providing this especially lethal I.E.D. and training people to use them. The Iranians encouraged Hezbollah to attack Israel, we all know that. And so would I sit down and have direct face-to-face talks with them? Probably not. Because that would legitimize a government that is dedicated to the extinction of the state of Israel, which they say repeatedly. Would I have lines of communications with them? Sure. Absolutely. And probably the most overrated thing in the world and in the world of national security issues is this sit down face-to-face. There's plenty of ways to communicate.In the case of our other allies I think one of the mistakes we've made all along is not having them more involved in a broad variety of ways. And I would try to make it clear to them what the consequences of failure are as well, as far as how it would impact their national security.Q. Iran seems to be moving ahead with its nuclear program.Q. Some argue that . . . to the extent they might have been emboldened by the American difficulties in Iraq —Q. — and their nuclear programs might be a case of it. As president, how would you attempt to deal with it? Would you rely essentially on a containment strategy? Economic sanctions? Or would you seriously consider a military option?A. I would do everything that I could to increase the economic, diplomatic, moral pressures on Iran, including doing what we can to encourage the pro-democracy elements within Iran. I do believe that there is some limited effect of some of the sanctions that have already been brought to bear against the Iranians. And if the United Nations wouldn't do it, I would work more closely without European allies. We have, at least in France coming up, and in Germany, different leadership than we've had in the past. So I have some renewed optimism about better cooperation from an effort on the part of the Europeans. And I think there are many, many areas that have yet to be exhausted. But I agree with the president of the United States when he said we will not allow Iran to destroy the state of Israel, or any other state for that matter. And so, would I use the military option? Under almost every scenario I would not. But to say that under no circumstances would you ever use the military option, then would I think — would not be the right way to make the Iranians understand that we will not tolerate the extinction of another nation. And so, I guess in some — I would not take the military option off the table, but I certainly believe there's many other options that need to be explored and traveled before we would even seriously consider it. It's a very complicated operation, by the way, from a tactical standpoint.Q. How many years does the United States have . . . .A. I don't know. I don't know the answer, Michael. Some say two, some say seven — I don't know the answer to that. But I think that we have good enough intelligence and so do our allies to know if they really actually acquire one. At least I hope so.Q. . . . Given that you are also uncertain of the surge . . . doesn't it makes sense to start thinking about some Plan B? In other words, if you come into the White House and the surge has not worked . . .A. Oh, obviously. We will know if it's not working or working. We will know within months. I don't know how many months, but within months we will know. Then, if it's apparent that it is failing, then I would — obviously, you would have to seriously consider what the options are. So far every expert who I have talked to knows of no good option — now some may be less bad than others — but knows of no good option.A. Look, Adam, this will be dictated by the American people. The American people will dictate this —Q. The next president will have to make these decisions. And the one thing I thought was interesting about . . . there are so many of these ideas that are put forward by people here and they seem attractive . . . . The point you're making is that when you look at them and scrutinize them and kind of put them to the test . . . you think they're sorely deficient. And kind of what I took you to be saying was that really the surge is the best of — the new strategy is the best hope there is to try to reverse the decline or salvage the situation, and that absent that you really have to confront seriously of the possibility of withdrawal from Iraq.A. Of course. But I would confront those issues if the surge is failing. For me to say, well, I'm supporting the surge and this new strategy, but here's what we're going to do if it fails — we'll have plenty of time to develop alternate strategies, if there are any, if this new strategy fails. So what you're asking me to do — I mean we're going around and around on this, in all due respect — what you're asking me to do is say, Well, if it fails we must do B. I want to devote all of my effort, every fiber in my body to see that this thing succeeds. We will know if it's going to fail. So I am not, I am not going to tell you what the alternatives are because I know of no good alternative.Q. But what I take you to be saying, and I'm not trying to —Q. [beat a dead horse?] here is that if the surge fails there may be no better alternative than withdrawal from Iraq.A. And as I say, if the surge fails I will not have any — I will not be able to decide that. The American people will demand it. They will not be satisfied with an open-ended commitment without succeeding in Iraq.Q. So these kind of so-called partial plans or partial steps of limited deployment in Iraq or a partition, which we might enforce, or training, you think it's something the American public wouldn't accept.A. Well, I think they might accept — Again, it's awful hard to know what the situation is at that time. Whether it's — I mean it's just impossible to — because there's a thousand scenarios. But I do believe that history shows us, Americans will not continue to support an overseas engagement involving the loss of American lives for an unlimited period of time unless they see some success. And then, when they run out of patience, they will demand that we get out. And if we get out, I believe that there will be chaos and genocide and we will be in a very, very long conflict.Q. Can you see circumstances where you would try to argue to the American people that we need to actually send more troops in? That the problem with the surge, it didn't work because there weren't enough . . . ?A. It would depend on whether or not I thought that would bring success or not. Petraeus obviously felt that he needs to do what the Defense Department has just announced. So I think it would depend on whether I thought that that would be a viable solution or just putting good people after good people. And so I don't —Q. . . . If he came to you and said, Give me another X number of troops, I think we can make this work, even there are no signs of progress . . .A. It's a very hypothetical situation, but obviously the burden of proof would be on the military commanders. At the end of the Vietnam War, after the Tet offensive, the military came and said we need 400,000 additional troops I guess it was, and the American Congress said no. So we left. So we lost the war.Q. I don't have any more Iraq questions, I'm just thinking — and I understand you don't want to prejudge the surge — the American public, the Pentagon and the various agencies will look to the president and the White House for what our future strategy will be, and that'll have to be something.A. If the strategy is succeeding they will not ask for an alternate strategy. If it's failing then obviously they will. We will know over the next some months whether it's succeeding or failing. We'll have plenty of time to devise a strategy if we are forced to withdraw.Q. Do you think we'll know before the caucuses?Q. When is that?Q. Well we'll know — I mean Secretary Gates and Petraeus have said they expect to see indications over the summer whether . . . trends are positive. So if it fails you'll know before the caucuses, if it succeeds you may only have a partial verdict.Q. Can I ask you if —A. Yeah, and this also is related to the Maliki government, also, whether they are functioning effectively. Go ahead.Q. If you were president and you had to pick a team — military team, civilian team — who are the sorts of national security advisers that you draw on and that you expect to draw on?A. Gen. Jim Jones is one of my closest and long-time friends and associates, so I think he would play a key role. I think so far that Gates is doing a good job.Q. You might keep him on in his current capacity?A. I hate to engage in this — But it seems to me that he is doing a fine job. I would also try to get some people into the Pentagon who are very successful in other parts of American life — Fred Smith of FedEx; John Chambers of Cisco — people who have succeeded and know how to manage. Our problem in the Pentagon today is that there's never been really strong management for a long time. I would go to these people and say, Look, you've made a billion dollars, come on now and do what David Packard did years ago, serve your country, be in charge of acquisition reform, be in charge of weapons or — you know, make the Pentagon run, that kind of thing. You've got to get people, I think, who have the proven skills at managing, and then try to get the world's largest bureaucracy under some kind of efficiencies.Q. What type of person do you think would serve as the chairman of the Joint Chiefs ?A. Hmm, if Petraeus succeeds, obviously he would be one of the candidates. I think Odierno is clearly good. Every report I hear about Admiral Fallon is good. I think that there are some people now, like McMaster —A. Yeah. But I see them emerging as kind of a battle-tested level of leadership and proven skills.Q. Senator Obama had talked about what to do . . . —A. I complimented him. I thought he said that if the president's veto isn't overridden go ahead and give him a clean bill and let's support, you know, give them the money they need.Q. Do you think he's been acting responsibly on this?A. Oh, I don't — I respect his views and his position. I don't — I've made it very clear that I think that this is a struggle that transcends electoral politics — and what happens now will affect future generations of Americans. And for us to be engaged in partisan political activity is a source of great sadness and sometimes anger. How many times have we taken up the war in Iraq on the floor of the Senate already? I mean how many times do we have to? How many times do we have to have a resolution? How many times do we have to have a debate and a vote? And, no, it doesn't affect the morale of the men and women who are over there fighting, but it doesn't increase their respect for us. And I'll tell you that from personal experience.A. They asked me when I went over there, When are you guys going to stop arguing about this? When are we going to have —A. Privates, corporals, sergeants — they go online, they know what's going on. They're very aware. Now, does this mean they aren't going to do their job, carry out their mission? Absolutely not. They'll shoulder their weapon and they'll go fight. But, as I say, they don't believe that — They'd like to have a set strategy and support from the American people. They'd like to have that. When you tell somebody that you support them but you don't support the mission that they're on and you believe that they're going to fail if you go on it, that's not exactly the kind of support that these young people are seeking.I don't question anyone's motives nor anyone's — I question his judgment and the others' judgment on this issue. I question their judgment. And I question their judgment because I do not believe that you can just set a date for withdrawal and then, again, with the exception of Biden, then what do you do?Q. Do you think, between him and Mrs. Clinton, do you think one of them has a better command of the issue?A. Yeah. You know, I can't make those kinds of judgments.Q. Did you meet recently with President Bush?A. I have a meeting with him this afternoon?A. Well, one of the things that I'm going to tell him, and I don't often talk about my conversations with the president, the American people need to be told more often what's happening. They need to know what's happening — where we're succeeding; where we're failing; where we've made progress; where we haven't; here's the state of readiness; here's why we continue to see suicide bombers; in Anbar province 16 of the 24 sheiks are on our side; now in Diyala province things are tough, some of these al Qaeda people have fled, and Mahdi Army, have fled Baghdad and they're raising hell, we're going to have to have some control there, but we can't lose control of the neighborhoods of Baghdad. I mean people need to be told these things.I called up Maliki and I said, Mr. Prime Minister — I'm speaking as Bush — Mr. Prime Minister, you got to enact these laws, you've got to enact these laws.In other words, there's got to be more communication with the American people, in my view. Franklin Delano Roosevelt did it. So — When I went to the floor with a map of Iraq and pointed out with my pen, you know, different places like that, people — you know, we got calls from —Q. You guys don't talk that often?Q. How long has it been since you've had a meeting with him?A. He asked to see me and Lindsey [Graham] as a result of our trip.Q. When you were giving that speech yesterday I was thinking I haven't heard anyone make the case for either the surge or the success, or however you want to put it, of the surge until I heard you saying it.A. The American people need to be talked to. As a result of the town hall meetings that I've had all over the country but, strangely enough, primarily in Iowa and New Hampshire, people are very concerned. They want to know: How are we going to get out of this? How are we going to succeed? I don't think — see, and maybe I'm all wrong, I think if you can show the American people, Look, we're making this progress, we've got this under control, we're going to, you know, that things are getting better and here's why and etc., etc., I think they'll show some patience. But they've got to be told.Q. I just wonder whether he's saying it and we're not hearing it.And I think General Petraeus and Secretary Gates and General Pace, they're pretty cautious in their pronouncements now. They're saying it's early days, there are some indications. But in that sense they're not making —A. And they shouldn't. And they shouldn't. And they shouldn't.Q. So therefore there's no one making this.A. Yeah. But, see, I think they should say, I think you should say, Look, we've got 53 outposts now in the neighborhoods of Baghdad and things are much quieter. But I want to tell you, Diyala province, we're going to have a hell of a fire fight. And you may have noticed that they set off a bomb in the green zone and killed three politicians. I mean you should tell them the whole story, you see what I mean, rather than just say the good things. And you brief people like that and they say, Well, you know, I understand. At least that's what happens when I talk to them.And at the town hall meetings they stand up and say, Why are you doing this? I say, Well, let me take you through this. You know, they're still upset, they're still sad, they're still frustrated, but at least they understand that there is a process here that can succeed.And I'm not guaranteeing that this succeeds, Michael. I am not. I am just saying that I think it can. I believe it has a good shot. And if it doesn't succeed, then obviously we explore all those other options — but none of them are good. And this comes back around, I've got to have another option? Not right now. Not right now. But I may have to come up with one.Q. Are you a fatalist, as my colleague David Brooks wrote?A. Oh, yeah. Listen, you may not have seen my speech. That kid, -- I'm going to go see him this afternoon -- Mark Robbins …. Oh, God, I've seen a lot of things in my life, I've seen a lot of things, that kid sitting up there, his head, blood all over the back of him where he was . . . sitting up like that and grabs my hand and says, 'I'm honored you're here. Thanks for your support. We can win this fight.' You know? … I'm supposed to worry about my political future?'"
"'07-04-14,'0','“Redline” tells a simple story: high rollers bet on car races along the Los Angeles-Las Vegas corridor; an Iraq veteran (Nathan Phillips) returns home to find his brother in trouble with a counterfeiter; a singer (Nadia Bjorlin) raised near a racecourse takes a driving gig to secure a record deal; she is coerced into driving for the crook; the ex-soldier must liberate her.The movie is not about redefining cinematic narrative. The wrongful deaths of relatives are avenged (twice). Dialogue highlights include “We’ve got company!” (during a chase sequence) and “Do it because this is what you were born to do.”But let’s forget all that; this film is about surfaces, for young men with testosterone to burn, and the racing passages snap. The director, Andy Cheng, opts for a punchy neon palette, and the editing, by Dallas Puett and David Blackburn, is breathless. The camera’s intimacy with vehicles at rocket velocity is striking. The cars look terrific but don’t stand still long enough to let us admire them.Despite a tiresome objectification of women, “Redline” at least manages to preserve its heroine’s dignity. Its lovers are given a fine future, imperiling law-abiding motorists on Los Angeles freeways.“Redline” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has graphic ruptured metal.Directed by Andy Cheng; written by Robert Foreman, based on a story by Daniel Sadek; director of photography, Bill Butler; edited by Dallas Puett and David Blackburn; music by Klaus Badelt; production designer, David L. Snyder; produced by Mr. Sadek; released by Chicago Pictures. At the AMC Empire 25, 234 West 42nd Street, Manhattan. Running time: 95 minutes.'"
"'07-04-14,'0','Pelfrey was in line to take the loss when he was yanked with two outs in the sixth, and the Nationals threatening to add to their 2-1 lead. Pedro Feliciano suppressed the rally, and the Mets tied the score in the bottom of the inning, on Carlos Delgado’s single, before taking the lead in the seventh against the reliever Ryan Wagner.Wright singled up the middle and advanced to second when José Valentín walked with two outs. Randolph inserted Franco in a prime run-producing opportunity. He took the first pitch low for ball one and then ripped the next pitch through the infield into center to score Wright.“In that situation, you just want to concentrate on getting a ball that’s down,” Franco said. “He’s a sinkerball pitcher and keeps the ball low, so you don’t want to swing at the balls that are high. I could have hit it anywhere — to second base, to shortstop — but it went through the middle.”Scott Schoeneweis pitched a spotless eighth, and Billy Wagner a perfect ninth to record his third save and send Washington Manager Manny Acta, the Mets’ former third-base coach, back to his hotel with a loss in his managing debut at Shea. The Nationals fell to 2-9 this season, the worst record in the majors.“It’s scary to play a team like this because their record says that we should beat them handily but it never happens like that,” Billy Wagner said.The Mets entered spring training with a surplus of starters that the Nationals, who needed four to fall in line behind last night’s starter, John Patterson, would have surely enjoyed. Pelfrey outclassed his competition for the fifth starter’s job. But with three days off in the season’s first 10 days, the Mets could start their top four pitchers on normal rest and did not need Pelfrey.So, after starting in St. Petersburg, Fla., on March 31, Pelfrey said goodbye to his teammates. He pitched against Class A Vero Beach on April 7 in his lone tuneup.“We’ve been trying to keep him on his regular schedule,” Randolph said before the game. “It’s not the norm, but I’ve seen guys who don’t skip a beat.”Early on, Pelfrey tried locating his fastball on the inner half of the plate in an effort to jam hitters on a cold night. It did not work so well. Pelfrey’s control gradually disappeared, and he got into trouble in the second after falling behind in the count to three of the first four batters. After loading the bases with no outs, Pelfrey coaxed a double-play grounder. Dmitri Young scored, tying the game, and the No. 8 hitter, Chris Snelling, followed by blistering a first-pitch hanging changeup into right field to score Austin Kearns and give the Nationals only their third lead of the season.Pelfrey wriggled free from potential jams in the fourth and fifth by getting the Nationals to pound his sinker into the dirt for double plays.As he walked off the mound in the fifth, the normally reserved Pelfrey allowed a brief fist pump. With rain in the forecast tomorrow and again Monday in Philadelphia, the Mets may shuffle their rotation. Again, Pelfrey may be the odd man out.“I have five big-league starts,” Pelfrey said. “I don’t have any pull around here.”Juan Padilla had successful surgery yesterday to repair a partial tear of the flexor tendon in his right elbow. The Mets did not say when they expected Padilla to return, but the Braves’ Mike Hampton had the same surgery earlier this week and will miss the rest of the season.'"
"'07-04-14,'0','“With the way things have gone with Chien-Ming and Moose, yeah, it’s disappointing,” Pavano said. “I want to be out there every fifth day. But I think the wiser course of action is the way to do it.”Pavano threw seven strong innings in Minnesota on Monday for his first victory since May 22, 2005. But he said he felt elbow stiffness near the end of the Twins game, then felt tightness when he played catch the next two days.“I threw on Tuesday and Wednesday, but it didn’t feel like I thought it should feel,” he said.Since June 2005, Pavano has missed time with injuries to his shoulder, back, buttocks, elbow and rib cage. Only the elbow required surgery; he had a bone chip removed last May. Pavano said that injury was not related to this one.“It’s in a totally different spot than what I felt last year,” said Pavano, adding that he would throw off the bullpen mound Sunday to test his arm.Torre said Pavano’s long layoff from pitching in the majors had probably tired him out.“He was asking his body to do something it hadn’t done in a year and a half,” Torre said. “Extending, getting out there, letting it go.”Rasner lost his first start last Sunday against Baltimore, when blisters hindered his command of off-speed pitches. He has treated the blisters since then and threw in the bullpen Wednesday with no problems.“I don’t think it’s going to be an issue,” Rasner said.Mussina played catch and did running exercises Friday, and he will also throw off a mound Sunday. Mussina said that while his hamstring felt sore, it was better than he expected over all. “We haven’t made any target dates and we haven’t talked much about the disabled list,” Mussina said. “We’re all thinking pretty positively right now.” The injuries come at a time when the Yankees’ strength and conditioning program is facing increasing scrutiny. During the off-season, General Manager Brian Cashman hired Marty Miller to the newly created position of director for performance enhancement. Cashman promoted Dana Cavalea to assist him.But while injuries are increasing, not decreasing, in frequency, Torre is not blaming Miller.“Obviously, we talked to Marty Miller when he first came on, and everything he does is geared toward making the body stronger and making the body function better,” Torre said. “A lot of things in baseball are unpredictable, as far as moves. I think that’s more the cause of anything than, for some reason, we’re changing the routine.“And, understand, we’re not forcing players to do things. Guys who are used to doing things a certain way are still doing things a certain way. I don’t, at this point in time, think there’s any reason to tie the two together. “But it doesn’t mean you’re defending something you’re not sure of. I don’t think we have enough information yet to make that connection and say, ‘Oh my God, what did we do?’ Because Marty certainly has information to back up everything he’s doing.”If Pavano cannot start Tuesday, it is unclear who would do so. Sean Henn is the long reliever, but he tired after about 40 pitches when he replaced Mussina on Tuesday. The Yankees would probably have to summon a pitcher from the minors, but none of those starters have major league experience.The rotation at Class AAA Scranton/Wilkes-Barre includes Tyler Clippard, Phil Hughes, Ross Ohlendorf, Matt DeSalvo and Steven Jackson, none of whom are on the 40-man roster. Hughes, 20, may be the best pitching prospect in baseball, but he does not seem quite ready, allowing five runs on seven hits and two walks over five innings in his last start.The prospect pitching best now is Chase Wright, a Class AA left-hander with a devastating changeup who is already on the 40-man roster. Wright, 24, has allowed no runs while striking out 19 in 14 innings this season, but he has pitched only two games above Class A.'"
"'07-04-14,'0','The full extent of Mr. Corzine’s injuries may not yet be known in part because no diagnostic test is perfect. Doctors may not have been able to perform a full neurological evaluation in the initial hours of Mr. Corzine’s treatment because of the pain, the extent of his injuries and his need for medication.“He does awaken and is able to communicate with us a little bit” and “is able to answer simple yes-or-no questions about whether he is having pain and things like that,” Dr. Steven E. Ross, head of the division of trauma and emergency services at Cooper, said at a news conference yesterday.Presumably, Dr. Ross eased the sedation to check Mr. Corzine’s mental status.Doctors generally use what is known as the Glasgow Coma Scale to measure a patient’s mental condition at the time of a serious injury. Mr. Corzine’s doctors have not released the results of that test.Although a CT scan showed no structural brain injury, that X-ray test does not rule out mental or physical damage. Mr. Corzine also suffered a broken lower vertebra, a bone that protects the spinal cord. Mr. Corzine’s doctors did not say whether there was any indication of paralysis or other spinal cord damage.Any of a number of complications — ranging from respiratory failure to heart problems to bone and systemic infections — could occur along the way, even under the care of doctors in a nationally respected trauma center like Cooper University Hospital.The broken leg and severe chest injuries each carry their own risks. The combination makes recovery much more complicated.One favorable factor is that the surgical team was able to stabilize Mr. Corzine’s left femur. That thigh bone was broken in two places, and a piece punctured the skin. The team, headed by Dr. Robert F. Ostrum, Cooper’s head of orthopedic surgery, ran a rod through the center of the femur, connecting the broken pieces so that it can heal as a single bone over the next several weeks.Fixing the femur fractures this early permits better cleaning of the wounds and allows him to get out of bed sooner. “He does not have to be flat in bed in traction, which is a huge advantage to his lungs,” Dr. Scalea said in an interview.“The big player here in how he will do is going to be much more driven by his thoracic injuries than his femur fracture,” Dr. Scalea said, referring to Mr. Corzine’s broken ribs and sternum and other chest injuries.There usually is no specific treatment for a broken sternum (breastbone), clavicle (collarbone) and ribs beyond pain relief and general supportive care.But the number of broken bones indicates the severity of the blow that injured Mr. Corzine’s chest. The force that is necessary to break the thick sternum and a dozen ribs in a cage that nature designed to protect the lungs and heart could have damaged those organs.Mr. Corzine is receiving intravenous injections of narcotics to relieve pain. Doctors usually tell patients they will need pain relief for up to six weeks or so after breaking ribs, though they may not need narcotics for the entire period. The drugs can affect an individual’s mental status, but patients differ in their pain tolerance and the amount and type of drugs needed to relieve it.Mr. Corzine faces at least two additional operations. The first, scheduled for today, is expected to remove dead tissue to reduce risk of infection and to make sure the wounds are healing well. The second is scheduled for Monday.Among the complications that Mr. Corzine faces are clots that develop in the legs, a problem known as deep venous thrombosis; the potentially fatal dislodging of pieces of fat from the broken bones that can then float with the blood to lodge in the lungs and damage them; pneumonia; and respiratory failure.Mr. Corzine lost about half the amount of blood in his body, and he could develop infections from the seven units of blood that he received as replacement transfusions to prevent him from going into shock, a potentially fatal condition. He may also need additional transfusions.'"

"'07-04-14,'0','“I agree that we’re warming,” he told a reporter, “and I agree that we’re playing a role in it. What I disagree with is his overall pessimism.”Mr. Hayward spends more than a little time in his film attacking Mr. Gore, whom he calls “an environmental extremist,” and poking fun at the style of “Inconvenient Truth,” including its hand-held camerawork, its arresting charts and its attention-grabbing props. At one point, for example, he mocks Mr. Gore’s dramatic use of a cherry picker to illustrate potentially soaring global temperatures.“I’m going to save some energy,” Mr. Hayward says, “and use a ladder.”That line was applauded by the 200 or so people who turned out on Thursday night. But global-warming bashing is not exactly a popular view in San Francisco, a green-is-gorgeous city that has banned Styrofoam, plastic bags and the like out of environmental concerns.This is also solidly Gore country. The former vice president based his cable channel, Current TV, in San Francisco and keeps an apartment here. He took 75 percent of the city’s vote in the 2000 presidential election. Statewide, a recent Field poll showed, he would be supported by 25 percent of Democrats if he were running for president again (he insists he is not); only Hillary Rodham Clinton (31 percent) scored higher.All of which is to say that it’s not easy being a global-warming skeptic — or an Al Gore skeptic — in San Francisco.“It’s very much like being a Christian in the first century,” said Mike DeNunzio, former chairman of the San Francisco Republican Party and sacrificial lamb in the 2006 Congressional race against Representative Nancy Pelosi, who beat him with 80 percent of the vote. “But there’s two sides to every story, and certainly we’ve been hearing one side.”Kalee Kreider, a spokeswoman for Mr. Gore, said Mr. Gore had not seen Mr. Hayward’s film but was accustomed to attacks on his positions.“Obviously Mr. Gore stands by the film,” Ms. Kreider said of “Inconvenient Truth,” “and we found that the mainstream scientific community agrees with its fundamental conclusions.”Sally C. Pipes, president of the Hayward film’s producer, the Pacific Research Institute, a “free-market think tank” based here, said she felt that Mr. Hayward “did a very good job of presenting the issue in a very balanced way.” Ms. Pipes also praised his “movie star potential,” just moments before Mr. Hayward — who is, well, big-boned — confessed to being a little nervous about being on the silver screen. “I’m a little frightened of seeing myself that large,” he said.For the most part, the audience seemed to enjoy the show, “oohing” at comments about less-than-catastrophic ocean level increases and giggling at Mr. Hayward’s jabs. “I like to say the climate is too important to be left to environmentalists,” he said.In a post-screening question-and-answer session, several people said they were relieved to see a differing viewpoint presented, while others questioned whether the idea of global warming might be “sociological hysteria” or “crying wolf.” One member of the audience wondered aloud whether God would have chosen Mr. Gore to save the planet, an observation that went unanswered by Mr. Hayward.Not everyone, however, was thrilled by the movie. Judith Anderson, 46, a local artist and self-described “free-market fan” who had come to see the film because she was “interested in the rebuttal” to Mr. Gore’s movie, gave the flick the ultimate thumbs-down.“It was terribly boring,” Ms. Anderson said. “I didn’t get his point.”'"
"'07-04-14,'0','He even countered with his own sports analogy. “It’s like buying the 1927 New York Yankees,” Mr. Rubin said, referring to a World Series team that included Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig.Mr. Pandit, a 50-year-old banker with a Ph.D in finance, said he was lured by the opportunity to build a business and take advantage of Citigroup’s global network and giant balance sheet.When asked about any ambitions for one day taking over for Mr. Prince, the question was quickly dismissed: “Let me be blunt: none,” he said. “I enjoy doing what we are doing. I want to enjoy doing it in a slightly different format than we did before.”The deal is expected to close in the third quarter of this year, and could slightly reduce earnings per share in the first year or two — something that Mr. Prince has hoped to avoid.The agreement with Mr. Pandit comes as Mr. Prince is under pressure from investors to improve the bank’s performance and rein in expenses. This week, he announced plans for a broad overhaul that will cut 17,000 jobs.Old Lane will operate as part of Citigroup’s alternative investment group, the smallest of Citigroup’s four major businesses. With hedge funds, private equity and real estate units, the division currently manages about $54.5 billion, including roughly $11 billion of Citigroup’s own money. Old Lane has about $4.5 billion in assets under management and a fund focused on investments in India. Many decisions on integrating the businesses have not yet been made.Mr. Pandit will join Mr. Prince’s senior management team, filling a spot that has been left open since Michael A. Carpenter left the bank in March 2006. Several of Mr. Pandit’s Old Lane partners will take top leadership positions within the alternative investment group. John Havens, a former Morgan Stanley equities head, will serve as president of the entire division; Guru Ramakrishnan, a former top trader at Morgan Stanley, will run the Old Lane investment fund.Dean S. Barr, the head of the group’s hedge fund investments, will remain in his post. Some had once considered him a contender to head the alternative investment group.Nearly two years ago, Mr. Pandit left Morgan Stanley after being passed over for a promotion that would have put him in line to succeed the chief executive then, Philip J. Purcell. At Citigroup, he may now get a second chance.Last year, the company hired PrinceGoldsmith, a boutique executive recruiting firm specializing in financial services, to conduct the search, along with one to identify a new financial chief. And with Mr. Rubin pulling for a strong leader to run the unit — a potential earnings powerhouse but currently a laggard — the process took several twists and turns.The search wound up, Mr. Rubin said, largely where it started. Early on in the process, Citigroup reached out to Mr. Pandit. He passed at the time.On Wall Street, of course, everything has a price.This time around, Mr. Pandit said, he was feeling “very, very comfortable with the leadership team” at Citigroup, which led him to agree to the deal.'"
"'07-04-14,'0','On Friday, he said, “My statement yesterday was in plain language.” Lips pursed, surrounded by reporters and cameras before and after the one-hour preliminary hearing, he declined to comment further.His lawyer, David B. Freedman, said: “I don’t know how much more you can apologize when you say ‘I apologize to the three players who were wrongly accused.’ We would hope people would understand that apology by Mr. Nifong. It takes a lot to admit he was wrong.”The apology was rejected by defense lawyers. One of them, Brad Bannon, attended the hearing, taking careful notes, and said afterward that the former Duke students and their families wanted Mr. Nifong “to have what he denied them — a fair hearing.”The hearing considered Mr. Nifong’s motion to dismiss the ethics charges that he had hid exculpatory DNA evidence.Lawyers for the North Carolina State Bar, which is pursuing the ethics case against Mr. Nifong, said he had misled judges and lawyers and failed to properly disclose reports showing at least four samples of unidentified male DNA on the accuser or her clothes, none of it from lacrosse players.Mr. Nifong’s lawyers argued that he turned over 1,844 pages of DNA reports in October, well before a trial was scheduled. They said that met the requirements of the law.Katherine Jean, prosecuting the ethics case for the bar, said Mr. Nifong learned of the DNA results six months earlier, in April — a week before he issued indictments against two of the men. Ms. Jean said it was “scary” to consider what would have happened if the men had had to plea bargain in the case, as commonly occurs, without the evidence.F. Lane Williamson, a Charlotte lawyer who is chairman of the three-member hearing panel, sided with the bar, though he cautioned that this was a preliminary issue without any evidence being heard. “If you were trying to hide that, you would do exactly that,” Mr. Williamson said. “You would dump the information rather than simply say, ‘Yeah, there were four other guys with DNA there.’ ”A few more details emerged late Thursday about the weakness of the case against the three men. Attorney General Cooper has promised a detailed report next week.He told the CBS program “60 Minutes” that the accuser had acted irrationally and appeared to be under the influence of drugs or alcohol when she spoke with his staff, according to a CBS news release. In a segment to be shown on Sunday, Mr. Cooper said the woman gave a new and unlikely version of the attack.Further, he said, the woman gave irrational answers when she was shown time-stamped photographs from the party that contradicted parts of her story. “It was usually that the picture was doctored or ‘that just can’t be true,’ or ‘Duke University paid someone off,’ ” Mr. Cooper said for the program.Mr. Cooper said the woman still wanted to press charges. But The News and Observer of Raleigh reported on Friday that the woman’s cousin has talked with her and “she’s just glad it’s over with.”'"
"'07-04-14,'0','For the past three years, petitions for the visas have far exceeded the cap. But this year was the first time that the cap was surpassed on the first day, triggering the lottery, according to the agency’s regulations.The H-1B visas are three-year work visas for immigrants who have at least a bachelor’s degree, either from an American or a foreign university. Immigrants seeking the visas generally are young adults who are software and computer engineers, construction engineers, doctors and nurses, mathematicians and scientists.In 2005, the last year for which figures are available, about 40 percent of the visas went to immigrants from India. About 54 percent of the immigrants who received the visas that year had a master’s degree, a doctorate or a professional degree. High-skilled visa holders can extend for another three years before they must return home. They can also apply to become permanent residents.With about half of this year’s applicants eliminated in the lottery, thousands of immigrants waiting overseas for jobs and foreign students graduating from American colleges have been left in limbo.“Many members of the Class of 2007 effectively received deportation orders and lost their post-graduation jobs last week,” said an April 9 editorial in The Harvard Crimson, the student newspaper. Harvard seniors would not be able to apply for this year’s high-skilled visas until after they graduated in June.For three years after 2001, the visa limit was raised by Congress to 195,000. It reverted to the 65,000 in 2003. The immigration agency is still accepting petitions for H-1B visas from those with advanced degrees from American universities, who do not fall under the limit of 65,000.Some critics of the visas argue that American companies use them to hire foreign software programmers with unexceptional skills who may be willing to work for lower wages than Americans.“If you wanted to find a labor shortage, you would look at the data and ask if there has been dramatic wage growth among those workers,” said Steven Camarota, research director at the Center for Immigration Studies, which favors curbing immigration. “We just don’t find evidence that wages are rising.”Employers seeking visas for immigrants must demonstrate to the Department of Labor that they will pay the immigrant at least the prevailing wage for the job and that hiring the immigrant would not negatively affect the labor conditions of United States workers in similar jobs.“There are penalties, and the Department of Labor really is enforcing these rules,” said Angelo A. Paparelli, an immigration lawyer. “So where’s the harm?”Several lawyers warned that businesses that could not hire skilled foreign employees might move abroad.Mr. Hoffman said Oracle hired 100 to 125 new H-1B visa workers each year, mainly software engineers, many of them foreign graduates of engineering programs in American colleges. “The competition for this talent is global,” he said.Mr. Saucier said Citizenship and Immigration Services would review the petitions to decide whether the applicants who survived the lottery met the requirements for approval.'"
"'07-04-14,'0','“I feel better about the stock’s long-term prospects,” said Robert Spremulli, an analyst at TIAA-CREF, which owns G.E. shares.The quarter had its blips. A new rule in Japan that limits interest rates to 20 percent is causing snags for GE Money. In the United States the unit suffered from the debacle in the so-called subprime mortgage market, which serves people with questionable credit.G.E. is a wholesaler in that market, issuing mortgages and selling the debt to other companies. “In the fourth quarter, the capital markets just shut down,” said Mark W. Begor, who heads GE Money’s American operations.Just as bad, the number of people defaulting on payments soared. Such defaults drove the delinquency rate for GE Money to 5.5 percent. While the unit’s sales rose 14 percent, its profits inched up only 2 percent.G.E. lost $373 million in subprime mortgages, and has put up $330 million in reserves. Mr. Begor said it has also tightened its lending criteria.GE Healthcare has had to shut two equipment factories while it fixes quality issues raised by the Food and Drug Administration. Medicare has reduced reimbursements to clinics for M.R.I. tests, leading to fewer equipment orders.Those factors resulted in a $50 million hit to earnings.But those areas of weakness were offset by booming sales of locomotives, aircraft engines and other items needed in growing economies. Across the company, G.E. has a backlog of $6 billion in orders.“We are in the first inning of a nine-inning game in infrastructure,” Jeffrey R. Immelt, G.E.’s chief executive, said in a conference call.Investors believe him. “The growth seems poised to continue over the next few years,” said Daniel J.

LOUISE STORYNOT FOR SALE After three months of hotly denying that it was involved in any takeover negotiations, the Dow Chemical Company discovered that, in fact, unauthorized talks had occurred.On Thursday, Dow fired J. Pedro Reinhard, a senior adviser to management, and Romeo Kreinberg, an executive vice president, saying they had held clandestine merger discussions with an unnamed third party. The company called their behavior “highly inappropriate and a clear violation of Dow’s Code of Business Conduct.”But while the executives may be gone, the takeover rumors persist. Andrew Liveris, Dow’s chief executive, has steadfastly denied that Dow has been approached. But three times this year — most recently last weekend — reports have surfaced in the British news media that Dow would be acquired.Few analysts expect that to happen. At $49.1 billion in revenue last year, it is too large for another chemical company to swallow. And with a market capitalization around $44 billion, it would be expensive for a buyout firm.Analysts also say that new owners would be foolish to try to recoup their money by splitting Dow up, because Dow’s chemical businesses, which buy and sell to each other as well as to the outside world, are very much intertwined.Dow has been buying back shares, forming joint ventures and building up its overseas sales. And it is banking that, even if a buyout bid is made, its shareholders will vote it down. CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCHLENDER WOES The CIT Group put three top executives of Student Loan Xpress, a student loan company that it acquired in 2005, on leave this week after learning that financial aid directors at three universities and a federal Education Department official held stock in the company.The personnel moves were only the latest fallout of investigations of the student loan industry. The New York attorney general, Andrew M. Cuomo, has raised concerns that close ties between student loan companies and colleges and universities create a conflict of interest for the officials that student borrowers rely on for advice.CIT also turned over documents to Senate staff members looking into the matter, showing that one Student Loan Xpress executive, Fabrizio Balestri, gave shares in the former parent of the loan company to the university aid administrators and to the Education Department official, Matteo Fontana. The financial aid administrators and the government official have all been put on leave, too.The biggest provider of student loans, Sallie Mae, meanwhile, is said to be in talks to be bought by private equity firms in what could be a deal for more than $20 billion, people briefed on the negotiations said. The discussions are taking place as the company agreed to pay $2 million and to change its business practices to settle a New York investigation.VONAGE CHIEF RETURNS Vonage Holdings, the Internet telephone company, announced that Jeffrey A. Citron had returned temporarily to run the company he founded seven years ago. Michael F. Snyder, chief executive since January 2006, also resigned his board seat, amid growing concern that Vonage’s battle with Verizon was starting to take a toll.The company also plans to lay off 10 percent of its 1,800 workers and cut costs by $140 million this year in a move to reach profitability. Vonage’s first-quarter revenue was about $195 million, missing analysts’ forecasts.A federal court has ruled that Vonage violated three patents owned by Verizon. Vonage is appealing that decision, and has received a temporary stay allowing it to continue acquiring subscribers.The case is far from over: On April 24, an appeals court will decide if Vonage can continue to attract customers while it appeals; if not, the company may find itself in deeper trouble. LAURIE J. FLYNNCHINA SPEAKS OUT After gritting their teeth at previous American complaints about the fast-growing trade deficit of the United States with China, Chinese officials are starting to lash out.The Bush administration hit China with a quick one-two: the imposition of countervailing duties on coated paper imports from China on March 30 in response to charges of Chinese subsidies, followed by the filing of two intellectual property complaints with the World Trade Organization last Tuesday.Beijing officials largely turned the other cheek after the first blow, expressing “strong dissatisfaction,” but added “deep regret” to their dissatisfaction on Tuesday and warned of “an outbreak of massive protectionism.”Most experts expect trade relations to worsen in the coming months, and not improve. The decision on coated paper defined Chinese subsidies very broadly, opening the door for as many as a dozen other American industries, notably steel makers, to seek similar protection from Chinese competition.

"'07-04-14,'0','The lawsuit focuses on the process HIP uses to determine what procedures are medically necessary.Known as utilization review, that process requires that denials of coverage be approved by a physician who specializes in the treatment. The Brookdale lawsuit says HIP's denials often relied on inappropriate medical rationales that could not have been made by physicians. The lawsuit also says physicians' signatures on these denials were electronically produced and were never original.In one example, the Brookdale lawsuit says a woman admitted in October 2006 for a malignant brain tumor was denied coverage for eight days of treatment based on standards used for treating infectious disease.""Some of these were so off the wall that they couldn't have been reviewed by physicians,"" said David P. Rosen, president and chief executive of Brookdale and its parent company, MediSys Health Network.The hospital lawsuit contends that at least three other companies that worked with the hospital received financial incentives to assist HIP in denying coverage. Two of the companies, Central Brooklyn Medical Group, a physicians' group that referred patients to Brookdale, and HealthCare Partners, which performed utilization reviews for some HIP members, declined to comment until they could review the lawsuit.A third company, Cogent Healthcare, which placed doctors and nurses at the hospital, denied the allegations.""Cogent's nurses and care team are in place at Brookdale only to monitor and improve the delivery of quality patient care,"" the company said in a statement. ""All reimbursement decisions are handled exclusively by Brookdale and HIP.""Cogent said its doctors and nurses played no role in the financial aspects of patient care. But the lawsuit says Brookdale has documents showing that Cogent nurses instructed HIP to deny payment for part of some patients' hospital stays and that HIP commended the nurses for providing other information that helped it make coverage decisions.In 2001, the state attorney general's Health Care Bureau issued a report critical of HIP's utilization review process. Among the findings, the bureau said that the company routinely failed to explain coverage denials adequately, and that it was often impossible to tell if the denials were properly peer reviewed, as required by law.The company denied the findings, but as part of a settlement it promised to revamp its process. A spokesman for the company said that any deficiencies then were due to the company's ""growing pains"" in trying to comply with new health care laws, and that in two years of monitoring, the attorney general's office issued no additional findings.But Michael Brown, a lawyer for Brookdale, said HIP has continued the practices outlined in the attorney general's report.The lawsuit examples show ""categorically that they ignored their promises to the attorney general,"" Mr. Brown said.Brookdale has sent a copy of its lawsuit to the attorney general's office. A spokesman there said it would be reviewed but declined to comment further.Mr. Rosen and another of the hospitals in his network, Jamaica Hospital Medical Center in Queens, filed a separate federal lawsuit last year against Oxford Health Plans. That suit contends that Oxford has used coercive tactics against Jamaica and failed to pay money owed to the hospital.'"
"'07-04-14,'0','After high school, Ms. Wheelwright and Ms. Russo-Young had parted ways. Ms. Wheelwright spent a year at Yale and then enrolled in Columbia’s general studies program, said her mother, Eliza Hicks.“She liked the school of the streets and visual arts,” Ms. Hicks said of her daughter’s instinctive streak, which included bungee jumping naked off a bridge.Her bungee-jumping friend, the photographer Ryan McGinley, recalled in an e-mail message that “everyone else freaked out about it, but Lily was excited to do it.” Mr. McGinley, who is preparing a photo book on Ms. Wheelwright for the memorial service, described her as his muse.“She was a beautiful tomboy,” he said. “She was always looking for an adventure and never scared to get into trouble. And if we ever did get in trouble, Lily would always get us out of it.”Ms. Russo-Young, who attended Oberlin College, reunited with her old friend after Ms. Wheelwright’s younger sister, Josie, auditioned for “Orphans” and then mentioned her to Ms. Russo-Young. “Josie was funny and full of life, but the character of Rosie was a little bit more edgy, someone less innocent, who had seen the world,” Ms. Russo-Young said. “Lily didn’t act beautiful, and she was a completely free spirit.”Ms. Wheelwright was still so nervous about her first on-screen crying scene that she spent a day with an acting coach. She also mentioned her history with drugs to Ms. Russo-Young and Ms. Flynn, another Saint Ann’s alumna. Ms. Russo-Young said there were no problems during filming in upstate New York in early 2006.After finishing the film, while Ms. Russo-Young edited, Ms. Wheelwright, who was fluent in Spanish, decided to move to Barcelona. She rejoined the cast in Austin, Tex., at the South by Southwest Film Festival where, Ms. Russo-Young said, “we all thought she looked great.”“At the festival, I hung out with her, we saw some movies, went to some parties together, stayed up late and had a fun time,” Ms. Russo-Young said.Ms. Wheelwright returned to New York for her parents’ 25th wedding anniversary and a 60th-birthday party for her mother. “There were people there she hadn’t seen in years,” Ms. Hicks said. “Lily was talking about going for more acting calls and was torn between going back to Barcelona and staying in New York.”Then came the news of Ms. Wheelwright’s death. Ms. Hicks said the medical examiner surmised that Ms. Wheelwright “had a relapse moment real bad.”“It was something that would call to her — something in the brain — that takes time to get out when they have a relationship,” she added, speaking of her daughter’s problems.A screening in Ms. Wheelwright’s memory will be held April 30 at 10 p.m. at the IFC Center on West Third Street in Greenwich Village. “Since Lily’s death, everybody wants to see the movie,” said Ms. Russo-Young, who estimated the cost of the film at “under $1 million.” Distribution can be difficult for neophyte directors, but Ms. Russo-Young said she has received offers for theatrical distribution and a DVD release. (She declined to provide specifics.)The sequence of events, however, continues to haunt her. “I have no idea how to make sense of it,” she said. “It feels freaky, weird, something I never could have foreseen.”'"
"'07-04-14,'0','KEY WEST, Fla., April 13 (AP) — A California-based sports agent has been convicted of smuggling five Cuban baseball players into the United States.The agent, Gus Dominguez, 48, was found guilty Thursday of nearly two dozen federal charges, including conspiracy, smuggling, transporting and harboring. His attorney, J. Stephen Salter, said they would appeal. Most of the charges carry a maximum penalty of 10 years each in prison. A sentencing hearing is scheduled for July 9.Dominguez helped organize two smuggling trips across the Florida Straits in 2004, one of which failed, federal prosecutors said.Among the group that made it were Osbek Castillo, a pitcher in the Arizona Diamondbacks’ system, and Francisely Bueno, a pitcher in the Atlanta Braves’ organization.'"
"'07-04-14,'0','“It’s very structured. They know exactly what they’re doing and who they’re going after,” said that advocate, who refused to be named for fear of retaliation. “People are told not to seek medical treatment. They don’t come to us and tell what happened, because they’re simply terrified.”On Friday, the Zimbabwe Association of Doctors for Human Rights issued its own statement on the attacks, saying it had documented 48 hospitalizations and more than 175 lesser medical treatments for assaults in the last month alone. The association is nonpartisan and does not try to identify the political affiliations of the victims.The group’s chairman, Dr. Douglas Gwatidzo, said in an interview on Friday that the attacks seemed to have peaked in late March.“It’s a continuous level of attacks, without an increase or decrease,” he said. “We see maybe three or four a day coming into hospital. But that’s not a reflection of what’s happening on the ground.”Among the injuries, the doctors’ group reported, were six gunshot wounds, one of them fatal; four head injuries; and 11 fractures.Assaults on opposition figures have been a staple of Zimbabwe election campaigns during this decade, but critics of Mr. Mugabe’s government say that the latest barrage of attacks is the most intense of all. Many of the victims have been beaten by police officers after being arrested and jailed; many more have been abducted from their homes. Those who are abducted are generally driven to rural areas where they are severely beaten.The government has yet to comment on the assaults. In part because most of the victims are opposition party members, many critics say the beatings mark the start of a strategy to ensure Mr. Mugabe’s victory in the next presidential election, scheduled for March 2008.Mr. Mugabe, 83, has ruled unchallenged for 27 years, but by any measure his hold on Zimbabwe’s presidency is at its weakest. With prices now rising at least 50 percent each month and four in five adults jobless, many ordinary Zimbabweans openly detest him, and the party he commands, the Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic Front, has made little secret of its hope that he will make way for a successor.Mr. Mugabe is under intense pressure from neighboring African governments, which have come to regard Zimbabwe’s collapse as a regional threat, to restore some measure of democratic rule. President Thabo Mbeki of South Africa was named this month to broker a political settlement between Mr. Mugabe and leaders of the opposition in time for the presidential race.Western diplomats and election observers generally believe Mr. Mugabe’s party has won major elections this decade only through fraud. The government’s critics see the attacks on the opposition as the beginning of a strategy to ensure that the Movement will be unable to win even a reasonably fair presidential race. In a telephone interview this week, the United States ambassador to Zimbabwe, Christopher Dell, called the assaults “a concerted, thorough, sanctioned-from-the-top effort to cripple the M.D.C.,” as the opposition party is known, “by physical violence and intimidation.“He’s hoping that international attention will drift away from Zimbabwe again so he can do this in the dark of the night when no one is looking,” Mr. Dell said.'"
"'07-04-14,'0','Inevitably, shoppers are starting to grumble. “They aren’t selling as many fruits and vegetables,” said Yeva Y. Terekova, a retired teacher shopping for groceries at Syestniye Ryady market in Moscow on a recent afternoon. “Prices went up, too.”Another pensioner standing nearby, however, offered, “It’s better now without the Azeris in the market.” After the collapse of the Soviet Union, the vegetable markets came to be dominated by thousands of immigrants, mostly young men and women from the former Soviet states in Central Asia and the Caucasus. Like immigrants everywhere, they came to Russia for work. And as elsewhere, their presence has stirred resentment and demands that the jobs they created be given to natives.Police teams from the Federal Migration Service have arrived in buses to enforce the new rule, arresting and deporting immigrants in a policy that polls show is popular among Russians. Notices pinned to the door of markets advertise open spaces for Russians, or “farmers from the Fatherland.”In one poll by the independent Levada Center, 54 percent of Russians supported the statement that “Russia is for Russians,” a phrase the pollsters used to gauge the extent of anti-immigrant feeling. The survey, conducted in December, had a margin of error of 1.7 percent.“The government is playing with the crowd in a dangerous way,” Lev D. Gudkov, the center’s director, said. “The level of xenophobia is high.” The government decree was intended, ostensibly, to ease ethnic tension after anti-immigrant rioters in the northern Russian town of Kondopoga torched market stalls owned by immigrants last autumn.The government’s solution was to reserve market stalls for Russian farmers while cracking down on the grocery mafias that, according to popular lore and official statements, control the markets where so many Russians shop for food and household basics daily.“This will ease tension on the labor market and make it more civilized,” President Vladimir V. Putin said in November, when the law was drafted, in remarks carried by the state news agency, RIA. The decree bans immigrants from trading, but not from jobs as porters or janitors. Critics say that plays into stereotypes of Central Asians and Caucasians as crafty, cheating on the scales or gouging elderly people on the prices.Critics also say the decree plays into the hands of Russian nationalists who are playing an ever more prominent role in rallies and marches as presidential elections approach next year.Galina V. Kozhevnikova, a deputy director at SOVA, an organization that monitors hate crimes, said the rule would embolden anti-immigrant groups, suggesting official sanction of their views. SOVA recorded 539 attacks on ethnic minorities in 2006, including 54 racially motivated murders. Russia’s vegetable markets operated on a network of immigrant families — principally Azerbaijanis, Uzbeks and Tajiks in the west and China in the eastern parts of Siberia — with ties to the warmer climates where the produce grows. They were bustling, crowded spaces with the feel of an eastern bazaar, selling everything from hot plates to clothes to persimmons to sides of mutton or whole hog heads. Now, some are half empty, and traders say an era is coming to a close.Mr. Umarov must speak furtively to clients who ask how to apply his marinades, or ask for a whiff of the fresh ground pepper. At any moment, he said, he could be shut down.Before the immigrant markets opened, in the mid 1980s, Muscovites might search for days to find fresh produce.The city’s low regard for immigrants was baldly displayed last winter, when the snow-laden roof of a vegetable market collapsed and crushed 66 people to death, 64 of them immigrants. Mayor Yuri M. Luzhkov said the victim’s families would be compensated — but only those living legally in the city, a tiny fraction of the total. The rule took effect in stages, limiting immigrant traders to 40 percent of the total in markets from Jan. 15 through April 1, and now prohibiting them entirely.At the Dorogomilovsky Market in Moscow, a notice taped to an empty stall advertised, “Help wanted, a Russian citizen trader.” A Central Asian man leaned against a wall nearby, idly cracking sesame seeds in his teeth and spitting the husks onto the sidewalk.At the meat counter, a young Slavic man awkwardly wielded an ax to hack ribbons of fat from mutton ribs, under the watchful eye of an Azeri butcher. Mostly, the stalls vacated by immigrants remained empty, with few Russians apparently willing to try the menial work.The share of retail trade taking place in markets, meanwhile, has dropped from 19 percent of the total in January to about 17 percent today, according to German O. Gref, the minister of economic development and trade, who has warned that the decree might spur inflation.So far, however, price increases have been largely offset by the seasonal drop in prices with the onset of spring, officials say. Mr. Umarov, for one, thinks the government will eventually back down and rescind the decree. “They think that they will take this work from us, that when we leave, they will have this work,” he said. “But they cannot work like us.”'"
"'07-04-14,'0','Just-war theory considers a war morally justified only if it is fought for a just cause as a last resort by a legitimate authority acting with good intentions. The war must have a reasonable chance of success and of not doing more harm than good, and it should be conducted by moral means, avoiding, for example, deliberate attacks on civilians.Mr. Weigel’s elucidation of this moral tradition has been notable for two emphases. For years, he has scolded the Catholic bishops and other just-war proponents for claiming that the teaching begins with “a presumption against war.” On the contrary, Mr. Weigel has argued, the “classic” doctrine treated war not as a moral anomaly that had to run a gantlet of moral tests before it could be justified but as “a moral category,” a neutral instrument of statecraft that could be used for good or ill. The tradition should never be removed from the obligation of nations (like the United States in Iraq) to assure security, justice and freedom.Second, in the run-up to the invasion of Iraq, Mr. Weigel insisted that religious leaders should exercise “political modesty” in the public debate, recognizing that government officials “are more fully informed about the relevant facts.” Employing the term “charism,” usually associated with saints who founded religious orders, he proposed that government officials enjoyed a “charism of political discernment” that was “not shared by bishops, stated clerks, rabbis, imams, or ecumenical and interreligious agencies.”The thrust of these emphases was of course to undercut the moral objections of many religious leaders about the potential human and political costs of invading Iraq.In his latest essay, Mr. Weigel grapples with the fact that those costs have become painfully evident, and the larger concerns of security, justice and freedom increasingly elusory. Now his case for war scarcely mentions the earlier suspicion of weapons of mass destruction but stresses a need to defeat jihadi terrorism and establish responsible government and peace throughout the Middle East.He laments “mistakes made by analysts and U.S. policy makers,” who remain unidentified except for the “convenient scapegoat,” Donald H. Rumsfeld. Finally, he defends the administration’s latest strategy against an alternative that he defines simply as “we’re out.”In all this, he merely alludes to his earlier critique of the “presumption against war” and makes no mention of the “charism of political discernment.” But his animus toward antiwar religious leaders is unabated.Which is what struck the editors of Commonweal, who have consistently opposed the war. In contrast to the second thoughts of many liberals originally convinced of the Iraq war’s necessity, the editors note, “no such admissions of error, or even regret, have been issued by outspoken Catholic neoconservatives.” Does Mr. Weigel’s long list of American miscalculations, they wonder, “cast doubt on his claim” about the government’s “charism of political discernment”? Reviewing the prudential warnings and moral qualms issued by the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, “it is hard not to conclude,” the editors write, “that the bishops’ charism, rather than the president’s, has better served the nation.”Both Commonweal and Monsignor McElroy, in America magazine, deny that given the potential destructiveness of modern warfare, just-war teaching has been deformed by making a “presumption against war” its starting point. To reject this development, Monsignor McElroy writes, reduces “a living, breathing moral tradition” to “a historical artifact.”“One implication of this strong presumption against war,” Monsignor McElroy adds, is that “moral scrutiny of the decision to wage war should take place not merely at the beginning of a conflict, but at every stage of its duration.”He examines, for instance, how the Iraq war’s stated cause has shifted from the imminent threat posed by an aggressive dictator’s alleged possession of weapons of mass destruction to “transformational democratization,” whether limited to Iraq or extended (as in Mr. Weigel’s vision) to the whole Middle East. “But transformational democratization falls outside the criteria of the just cause as it has been formulated in the modern age,” he writes.Looking at the traditional criterion of proportionality, Monsignor McElroy notes that supporters of the invasion once emphasized how “the complexities of war and geopolitics” made it impossible to predict whether the evils unleashed by war would outweigh good. But now, he writes, “these same advocates” cast aside “this epistemic modesty” and insist with certainty “that American withdrawal would be a catastrophic blow to peace and just order in the world.”For Commonweal, the record has thoroughly discredited Mr. Weigel’s version of just-war thinking. For Monsignor McElroy, “any effort to apply rigorous just-war thinking”— presumably not Mr. Weigel’s — dictates moving immediately “toward a measured and prudently crafted American military withdrawal.” For Mr. Weigel, such notions amount to an abandonment of “the mantle of moral seriousness.”'"
"'07-04-14,'0','The calculator provides a lot of other information, but it doesn’t figure in the $1,580 a year your cash outlay would have been making had you left the money in a conservative investment like a government bond. That’s more than enough to cover the monthly electric bill.As electricity costs — or the incentives — go up, the numbers start to make more sense. A person living in the scorching desert of California, where the financial incentives are said to be the most enticing, and paying $250 a month to stay cool would break even in three to eight years.You can find what rebates governments and utilities are offering at a Web site set up by the North Carolina Solar Center and the Interstate Renewable Energy Council, www.dsireusa.org.“At this stage, you don’t put in photovoltaic panels for economic reasons,” said John Anderson, senior principal at the Rocky Mountain Institute, an energy consultant and research organization in Snowmass, Colo. He said the energy generated by utilities for 10 cents a kilowatt- hour held a distinct advantage over solar power that cost 20 cents to 40 cents a kilowatt-hour.Ron Kenedi, vice president of the solar energy solutions group at Sharp, a major maker of solar panels, said, “The utility rates — that’s who we compete against.”The other variable, the cost of the solar panels, has not been dropping much. An incentive program two years ago in Germany distorted the market and created worldwide shortages of the silicon-based devices. Demand is still ahead of supply, which means prices have not declined.Solar power advocates are urging Congress to make the tax credit even sweeter. It is set to expire at the end of the year, but until then your federal income tax can be sliced by a third of the cost of a system, up to $2,000. The lobbyists want the cap removed, as it is for businesses installing solar panels.Until Congress makes any change, the most compelling argument you will hear from advocates and installers is how solar power will increase the value of your home. Many pointed to a 1998 study by ICF Consulting (“Evidence of Rational Market Valuations for Home Energy Efficiency,” www.icfi.com/Markets/Community_Development/doc_files/apj1098.pdf) that concluded that every $1 reduction in annual energy costs would increase a home’s value by $20.73.“If their reduction in monthly fuel bills exceeds the after-tax mortgage interest paid to finance energy efficiency investments, then they will enjoy positive cash flow for as long as they live in their homes and can also expect to recover their investment in energy efficiency when they sell their homes,” the study’s authors wrote.The calculator cited above incorporates that theory. It said the New Jersey property would increase $11,000 to $21,000 in value. The California property, with a $22,412 solar system, would be worth $21,000 to $49,000 more. If true, appreciation like that would easily justify the expenditure.The finest kitchen renovation with a Sub-Zero refrigerator, Italian mosaic backsplash and black slate countertops would never yield that kind of return. But like all the estimates of what a home improvement yields, it is only a guess.'"

DoubleClick is the leader among companies that specialize in placing, or “serving,” the graphical and video ads that appear on Web sites. Ad-serving networks like DoubleClick place tiny programs on personal computers, called cookies, that monitor where an individual user goes online.Microsoft was joined today by AT&T, a company that traces its lineage to the Ma Bell monopoly that was broken up in the mid-1980s. “We think antitrust authorities should take a hard look at this deal and the implications,” said Jim Cicconi, senior executive vice president for external affairs at AT&T. “If any one company gets a hammerlock on the online advertising space, as Google seems to be trying to do, that is worrisome.”Microsoft was one the companies, along with Yahoo and Time Warner, that lost out to Google in the bidding for DoubleClick. Mr. Cicconi said that AT&T, by contrast, would be affected by a Google-DoubleClick combination because AT&T distributes services over the Internet like digital television, known as IPTV.“For many of these new Web services, it could be that the advertising-supported model is the predominant business model,” he said. “The danger here is that Google could be in a position to pick winners and losers.”This is not the first time that Microsoft, the biggest winner of the personal computer era, and Google, the emerging Internet powerhouse, have been on opposite sides of an anticompetitive claim. Early last year, Google complained to regulators that the design of Microsoft’s Internet Explorer browser steered users to Microsoft’s MSN search engine instead of rival search offerings from Google and Yahoo.After reviewing the matter, the Justice Department said last May that Microsoft’s browser allowed users a fairly easy way to switch to non-Microsoft search services. So Microsoft’s product design, the department said, did not pose an anticompetitive threat.In that case, Google did talk to antitrust officials in Europe and the United States about its concerns.Mr. Smith said Microsoft had not yet approached antitrust officials in the United States about its worries about Google’s purchase of DoubleClick.Mr. Smith said that based on conversations with several media and other companies over the weekend, he expected that many would soon come forward to express similar concerns.The initial antitrust review of mergers lasts 30 days. It is not yet clear whether the Justice Department or the Federal Trade Commission, which share antitrust duties, will review the Google-DoubleClick deal.Any review of a merger on antitrust grounds begins with a determination of the “relevant market” in which the two companies operate. “That is the first hurdle in case like this,” said Andrew I. Gavil, a law professor at Howard University, “and it looks as if DoubleClick may well be in a nearby, or complementary, market instead of the same market as Google. And then the question will be how easy it is for new entrants to compete in the online advertising markets.”The Microsoft analysis, Mr. Smith said, is that the combined companies will hold 85 percent of the market for distributing ads to Web publishers.Mr. Schmidt replied that Google and DoubleClick are each “small components of a much larger advertising market,” and each faces considerable competition. He added that it is easy to switch to offerings from rivals of Google and DoubleClick.“We understand that we will go through a regulatory process in the United States and Europe now,” Mr. Schmidt said. “Along the way, all these questions will be discussed and debated. And we welcome that.”'"
"'07-04-15,'0','WASHINGTON, April 14 — Senator John McCain, long considered the presumptive front-runner in the Republican presidential primary, has raised less money and also burned through it faster than his two leading rivals, leaving him with about half as much cash as each of the others at the end of the first quarter.Mr. McCain spent more than two-thirds of the roughly $12.5 million he raised in the quarter, ending up with about $5.2 million in cash as well as $1.8 million in debt, according to a report filed Saturday with the Federal Election Commission. His rivals — Mitt Romney, who raised about $21 million, and Rudolph W. Giuliani, who raised about $14 million — each ended March with more than $10 million. The McCain campaign payroll was about 25 percent higher than the others, and it spent more on fund-raising to bring in less money.Mr. McCain may also be struggling to keep up in the race to build a network of so-called bundlers, who can collect donations from wealthy friends and business associates. A preliminary analysis of the donors to the top three Republicans indicated that, so far, Mr. McCain has collected checks from roughly the same number of major fund-raisers for President Bush — about 60 — as Mr. Romney, a one-term governor of Massachusetts, who is far less well-known across the country. (Several gave to more than one candidate, and at least two — the financiers Bradford Freeman and Elliot B. Broidy — gave to all three.)Campaign finance laws cap individual contributions at $2,300 for the primary and another $2,300 for the general election, so campaigns depend on pyramids of bundlers to collect checks — networks that are more important than ever in this race. All the leading candidates are planning to turn down public financing for both phases of the race because they can raise more from such private donations.The two major party nominees are each expected to raise and spend more than $500 million by Election Day.'"
"'07-04-15,'0','MANILA, April 14 (AP) — The Philippine police and military are searching for an American Peace Corps volunteer missing for nearly a week in a mountainous northern area, officials said Saturday.Julia Campbell, 40, was last seen Sunday in the town of Banaue in Ifugao Province, where she had planned to hike alone, said an American Embassy spokesman, Matthew Lussenhop.The area, about 160 miles north of Manila, is famed for its mountainside rice terraces and pine forests. The armed wing of the Communist Party — the New People’s Army — also operates there.In 1990, the New People’s Army seized Timothy Swanson, a Peace Corps volunteer, and held him for 50 days on the island of Negros. He was released unharmed to the Red Cross.Mr. Lussenhop said the Peace Corps had started looking for Ms. Campbell after she missed appointments on Wednesday.“Embassy security officials and Peace Corps security and local authorities are in that region right now looking for her,” he said.'"
"'07-04-15,'0','The Nets, who have three games left until the postseason, may be able to suppress this season’s failures. Yet the fact stands that their play has been worthy of a first-round exit.The Nets, who are two games behind the Washington Wizards for sixth place in the Eastern Conference, are 10-6 over their past 16 games. Their only victories against an opponent with a winning record over that span came against the injury-depleted Wizards. They were 0-4 against teams seeded higher than they are in the East playoffs — the Detroit Pistons, the Miami Heat, the Chicago Bulls and the Cleveland Cavaliers.“We don’t care if we win against the good teams or the bad teams,” forward Bostjan Nachbar said after the Nets lost to the Cavaliers on Thursday night. “The important thing is that we get those wins that are going to get us into the playoffs, and when the playoffs start, that’s when we’re going to start focusing on beating good teams.”When the Nets talk about what has gone wrong this season, they often refer to injuries.In late December, they lost their starting center, Nenad Krstic, to a torn knee ligament. Small forward Richard Jefferson missed 21 games because of ankle surgery. He now seems to be regaining his form. Over the past week he has had point totals of 27, 35 and 24.The Nets have also had an assortment of bumps and bruises: Kidd’s ribs and back, guard Eddie House’s hip, forward Cliff Robinson’s knee and forward Josh Boone’s shoulder.They began the season 11-18, and the last time they had a winning record was when they were 5-4 on Nov. 18. They fell below .500 four days later with a loss to the Portland Trail Blazers.“At one point, the playoffs was far-fetched,” Carter said. “I think as a unit we just stuck together and played one game at a time. That was our approach in the second half of the season. As bad as we played some nights, we still had a goal of making the playoffs and we still had a goal of sticking together until the end. And good things have happened when we’ve stuck together and played Nets basketball.”MAGIC 104, 76ERS 87 Dwight Howard scored a career-high 35 points yesterday to lead the visiting Magic, which can clinch a playoff spot today if it beats Boston and the Pacers lose to the Nets.

"'07-04-15,'0','But the agreement that Mr. Hill signed with North Korea on Feb. 13 — in talks that also included China, Russia, Japan and South Korea — gave the North 60 days to deactivate and seal its main plant at Yongbyon, invite back international inspectors and provide a preliminary accounting of how much plutonium it has produced. The country had apparently taken none of those steps by Saturday.During a visit to North Korea this week by Gov. Bill Richardson of New Mexico, who is seeking the Democratic nomination for president, officials in Pyongyang said they would fulfill those obligations within 30 days of receiving the money that was held in accounts of Banco Delta Asia, in Macao. Investigators from the United States Treasury and American intelligence agencies pored through records of the frozen accounts, mapped the banking activities of state-owned companies, arms traders and the leaders surrounding President Kim Jong-il.“This was the first thing we ever did that got the North Koreans’ attention,” a senior White House official said in an interview this week, declining to speculate how the administration would react if the North Koreans missed the first deadlines for shutting its facilities.In fact, some administration officials acknowledge that they have few good options. With the money cleared for return, the Macao accounts no longer provide diplomatic leverage. That leaves the administration more dependent than ever on pressure from China, the North’s main supplier of energy and aid, to force North Korea to live up to the agreement.Nicholas Eberstadt, a scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, said that turning the money back to the North “complicates the logic of the Proliferation Security Initiative,” the administration’s plan to stop countries from illicit shipments of weapons, because it is allowing the North to retrieve its profits from those activities.“It also goes contrary to the Security Council resolution” passed at Washington’s urging after North Korea’s nuclear test on Oct. 9, he said. The test was something of a fizzle, a subkiloton explosion, but it was enough to win unanimous passage of a resolution that imposes new economic sanctions on the North.Now, Mr. Eberstadt said, “the North Koreans can force the Bush administration into continuing, humiliating reversals of its policy.”But administration officials dispute that view, arguing that Mr. Bush never reversed his policy. They contend that he simply waited for the right moment to strike the deal, after the nuclear test angered China’s leaders enough to move them from a neutral arbiter in the talks to a source of pressure on the North. North Korea reached the deal, they argue, because both China and South Korea cut aid.In public statements, both Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and the national security adviser, Stephen J. Hadley, have defended the accord as far more effective than an agreement signed between North Korea and President Bill Clinton in 1994, freezing the Yongbyon plant.“What you are hearing,” one senior official said, “are the complaints of a lot of people who simply don’t think we should be dealing with the North Koreans at all.”Among those who have objected, though, are former Bush administration officials who believe that the president has been so eager for a diplomatic coup that he has given up his principles — and is perpetuating Mr. Kim’s rule. Mr. Bush’s former ambassador to the United Nations, John R. Bolton, recently expressed the hope that the North Koreans would violate the Feb. 13 agreement and give Mr. Bush an excuse to renounce the deal.“One sign of whether we are in trouble is whether the administration will call this a ‘violation’ or use words like “noncompliance,” Mr. Bolton said recently, anticipating that North Korea would miss the Saturday deadline.Assuming that the North allows in international inspectors and seals the Yongbyon plant and the nearby nuclear reprocessing facility where it turns spent nuclear fuel into bomb-grade plutonium, it would then have to move on to the hardest part of the agreement. It is required to “disable” the nuclear facilities, a term that the agreement does not define.Ultimately, it would have to account for, and surrender, all of its nuclear weapons, an arsenal that American intelligence agencies believe has grown from enough fuel for one or two weapons when Mr. Bush took office, to fuel for somewhere between a half-dozen and a dozen weapons.'"

"'07-04-15,'0','RABAT, Morocco, April 14 (AP) — Two brothers strapped with explosives blew themselves up near an American cultural center in Casablanca on Saturday, and the police arrested another three people — including one wearing an explosives belt — hours later, an official said.The attacks came just days after three people suspected of being militants blew themselves up as they were cornered by the police in Casablanca, and Al Qaeda claimed responsibility for suicide car bombings in neighboring Algeria that killed 33 people. Morocco and Algeria have not addressed a Qaeda link in the bombings earlier this week. Both countries have allied themselves with the United States in its fight against terrorism.Saturday’s two bombers detonated their explosives in the middle of a boulevard that runs behind the American cultural center, killing themselves and wounding a woman, the official said, adding that the three suspects were arrested in the neighborhood, which is also home to the United States Consulate.After the arrests, a second explosives belt was found beside an upscale hotel in the same neighborhood struck by the bombings, the Interior Ministry official said on condition of anonymity, citing ministry policy.The official said the belts linked the bombers with three men who blew themselves up in Casablanca on Tuesday after being cornered by police. A police sniper shot and killed a fourth man who the authorities said appeared to be preparing to detonate a bomb.The official MAP news agency reported, meanwhile, that police had arrested the leader of a group responsible for the Tuesday suicide bombings and another last month in a cybercafe in Casablanca, Morocco’s largest city.It did not identify the suspect or say when the arrest took place. The agency said hideouts where explosive devices were put together also had been uncovered, along with the identities of the members of the group now being sought.'"
"'07-04-15,'0','Representative Harry E. Mitchell, Democrat of Arizona, another freshman, said the war was a second-tier issue for most people in his district, which encompasses the northeastern suburbs of Phoenix.During a meeting with business and community leaders in Scottsdale on Wednesday, Mr. Mitchell fielded questions for 45 minutes and no one asked a single question about Iraq.“It hasn’t been at the top of peoples’ minds as much as things like veterans have,” said Mr. Mitchell, a former high school civics teacher. “Veterans and immigration I hear a great deal more about than Iraq.”Still, Mr. Mitchell said he believed the war was never far from voters’ minds. One thing Mr. Mitchell said he thought was important was that people believe, as he does, “that the military has done an excellent job.”“They destroyed the Iraqi army,” he continued. “They captured Saddam Hussein. We’ve done so much militarily, but there are people who believe, and I think rightly so, that there is more to it than just a military deadline.”Veterans’ issues were also dominant during a public meeting on Thursday in Louisville, Ga., whose 3,000 residents pronounce their town’s name with an “s.” That’s where Representative John Barrow, one of 14 Democrats to vote against the 2008 withdrawal deadline, met voters at Pansy’s, a converted hotel that serves as the central lunch spot in the town, about 150 miles southeast of Atlanta.Mr. Barrow, whose district runs from the golf links of Augusta to the coastal charm of Savannah, heard a variety of complaints about health care, both for veterans and civilians. Talk of the war came up only when prodded by a reporter’s questions.“They shouldn’t have been there in the first place,” said Nathan Neely, 86, who took part in the invasion of the Philippines during World War II and was one of the few black men present. “They didn’t find what they was looking for,” he added, referring to the initial international hunt for a nuclear weapons program.Across the room from Mr. Neely, Bob Henderson, 61, a service manager at a Chevrolet dealership and a Vietnam veteran, sympathized with military families but insisted the country had to stay strong.“We’ve lost a lot of troops and a lot of blood’s been shed,” Mr. Henderson said, still wearing his workman’s uniform. But, he added, “To me, we’re losing face if we pull out.”It is also a personal thing, he said: his son is stationed at Fort Drum, near Watertown, N.Y., after a tour of duty in Afghanistan.For his part, Mr. Barrow, who in November was narrowly re-elected to a second term, said he had heard mainly positive responses to his vote against the deadline.“People understand that the war’s not going the way we wanted it to,” he said.But he added that they did not want Congress “to climb in the saddle.”Another lawmaker who voted against the deadline, Judy Biggert, a five-term Republican, said that her public events during the break were a relief. Intrepid constituents in her district in the southern suburbs of Chicago usually ambushed her at the gym.“People will come up to me and say, ‘I don’t want to disturb you, but I want to ask you a few questions about the war,’ ” Ms. Biggert said Wednesday.She said she spent a recent evening at a citizens’ forum, listening to her constituents talk about the war and other issues, including immigration and health care. Support for the troops was high on the list, she said, but there were also anxieties and people who were “very weary of us being over there.”“There are some people I talk to who are concerned that we’ve spent so much money on a war when there are services that are needed, and are not there, like health care,” she said.She said she stood by her vote against the deadline. “Back home, all the people in my district see is the bad news in Iraq,” she said. “But I have to remember, I have a very well-educated district.”Mr. McNerney, meanwhile, said he had heard both praise and scorn for his vote, not surprisingly. His district, which sprawls over four counties, includes liberal enclaves near San Francisco and more conservative areas to the east. Mr. McNerney in November defeated Richard W. Pombo, a powerful Republican incumbent.“The ones that are vocal tend to be like, ‘What gives you the right to tell the president to end the war?’ ” Mr. McNerney said, shaking hands outside a wind-raked rail station on Wednesday. “But when I give them a strong answer, I usually get some cheers.”'"
"'07-04-15,'0','“Migrating to the U.S. means you have the freedom to create your own identity,” said Keo Cavalcanti, a sociologist at James Madison University in Harrisonburg, Va., and a co-author of a recent study that found a trend toward secularization among Hispanics in Richmond. “When people get here they realize that maintaining that pro forma display of religiosity is not essential to doing well.”A separate study of 4,000 Hispanics to be released this month by the Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life and the Pew Hispanic Center found that 8 percent of them said they had “no religion” — similar to the 11 percent in the general public. Of the Hispanics who claimed no religion, two-thirds said they had once been religious. Thirty-nine percent of the Hispanics who said they had no religion were former Catholics.Hispanics from Cuba were the most secular national group, at 14 percent, followed by Central Americans at 12 percent, Puerto Ricans and Dominicans at 9 percent, and South Americans at 8 percent, the Pew poll found. Mexicans in this country were the least likely to say they had no religion, at 7 percent.A larger survey, called the American Religious Identification Survey, a study of 50,000 adults, including 3,000 Hispanics, found that the percentage of Hispanics who identified themselves as having no religion more than doubled from 1990 to 2001, to 13 percent from 6 percent.This change is happening even though many Hispanics immigrated from countries steeped in religion, where saints’ days and festivals mark the passage of time, and grandmothers round up their progeny each Sunday to go to Mass.“They come, they adopt the American way, and part of the American way is moving towards no religion,” said Ariela Keysar, associate director of the Institute for the Study of Secularism in Society and Culture at Trinity College in Hartford.Each year, Diana Lemus — a real estate agent and owner of Happy Mart, a busy Latino market in Richmond — makes New Year’s resolutions that include working out more, getting out of debt, being a better mother and attending church once a week.Ms. Lemus, a first-generation immigrant, said that this year she had kept all of them, except going to church — and spends Sunday mornings at the gym. She thinks her faith is important, but said that perhaps she has grown “too materialistic.”“I need God in my life, but I told the pastor, I get sleepy,” she said. “You have to stay in church from 1:30 to 5. I think if services were shorter, more entertaining.”Like Ms. Lemus, many Hispanics in Richmond said that even though they no longer attended church, their religion remained important to them. This confirms research findings that Hispanics who said they had no religion represent a small subset; many more Hispanics are living rather secular lives but still identify themselves as Catholics or Christians. The phenomenon is similar to that of “cultural Jews,” said Roberto Suro, director of the Pew Hispanic Center.“You can feel very strongly about the Virgin of Guadalupe and believe your children ought to be baptized, and still not participate in the Catholic Church or make it a major factor in your life,” Mr. Suro said.Richmond and adjacent Chesterfield County have a rapidly growing and diverse Hispanic population, with immigrants from the Caribbean, Central America, Colombia and Mexico. Some are new arrivals, but many have been in the United States for years and resettled here from Northeastern and Southern states, attracted by the area’s jobs, relatively affordable housing and receptive local governments.The increase in the Hispanic population has meant a proliferation of churches. But even when their own churches are thriving, Hispanic ministers say that most Hispanics they approach are not interested.“Church is not very popular,” said Francisco Hernandez, who is pastor with his wife, Connie, of the Iglesia de Dios Alfa y Omega, a Pentecostal church with 400 members. “The majority don’t go, and those who go, go one time.”Asked why, he said that his church’s strict rules were a hard sell, adding, “People like a superficial religion.”This may be true, and a few young Hispanic women said in interviews that they avoided strict evangelical churches because they frowned on women wearing pants or makeup. However, many more Hispanics said they were simply too busy to attend any church. They said Sunday is a work day, or it is their only day off to wash clothes, go to the market, do errands and relax.Before Mirna E. Amaya and her husband bought their restaurant, Palacio Latino, three years ago — and when she lived in Maryland — she went to Mass every Sunday. Now she says she is working too hard to go, even though she says she misses it.“In El Salvador, people went to the church because there’s nothing much else to do,” Mrs. Amaya said.She said that some of her women friends had stopped going because they became disillusioned with the Catholic Church after the priest sexual abuse scandals. But she said the Roman Catholic Church was still her preference. The closest parish, St. Augustine Catholic Church, has bent over backward to minister to Hispanics. It offers Mass in Spanish, classes in English, a medical van, job assistance and an instant community for lonely new arrivals. The Sunday Spanish Mass is standing room only.And yet, the pastor, Msgr. Michael Schmied, also the vicar for the diocese’s Hispanic Apostolate, said: “My fear is the strength of secularization, the influence of Americanized pop culture. Is the spiritual tradition of the church, Catholic and Protestant, strong enough to withstand the secularizing cultural influences?”Jesus Cerritos, a 37-year-old construction worker who immigrated from Mexico 18 years ago, said he spent his weekends running errands, going to Wal-Mart and watching television. His children, ages 11 and 9, tell him that church is boring and that they have no desire to go, but Mr. Cerritos has mixed feelings.“Here, the people get more materialistic,” Mr. Cerritos said. “The culture here is really barren. There’s no traditions.”If he were still living in his hometown of Guanajuato, he said, “I would probably go to church.”'"
"'07-04-15,'0','“So obviously you’re prepared to lose money when you buy a basketball team, and obviously I’ve fulfilled that requirement.”But make no mistake, Johnson is not content to keep losing money. He has replaced his front office staff, brought in Michael Jordan to run the basketball operations and urged N.B.A. Commissioner David Stern to implement revenue sharing for small-market teams like his.He was not prepared for the backlash from Charlotte fans over the Hornets’ ugly move to New Orleans after a failed referendum to build a new arena.When the team left in 2002, the N.B.A. quickly brokered a $265 million arena deal with the city to bring in a new team. The thinking was that the city’s anger was directed at the Hornets’ owner, George Shinn, not the N.B.A.But the crowds have been slow to return in Charlotte, where the Hornets led the N.B.A. in attendance for seven consecutive years. The Bobcats’ average of a little more than 15,000 fans a game ranks 27th out of 30 teams in the N.B.A.“I don’t think Bob anticipated it would be this hard,” said Felix Sabates, a Nascar team owner and a minority investor in the Bobcats. “I think someone in the league sold him a bill of goods about how easy it was going to be.“I think the N.B.A., they were pretty anxious to put in a new franchise for $300 million. I don’t think the N.B.A. did a very good job of researching the market before they came back in here.”They were forced to drop ticket prices after fan backlash. A regional television sports network Johnson started folded after one year. And the team is still tied to a deal with Time Warner Cable that prevents satellite dish owners and some cable subscribers from seeing most of the team’s games.The Bobcats also have been unable to secure a naming rights deal for the downtown arena.Last summer, Johnson cleaned house. The team’s president, Ed Tapscott, resigned rather than accept a demotion, and other top executives were fired. Johnson also folded the W.N.B.A.’s Charlotte Sting to save money.Sabates said, “In any business that’s not successful, somebody has to take the fall — and it’s not the guy who writes the checks.”Perhaps Johnson’s biggest move was bringing in Jordan last summer. A North Carolina native who led the Tar Heels to the national championship before his N.B.A. stardom, Jordan has the final say on all basketball decisions.But more important, he was willing to put several million dollars into the franchise to become a part owner, despite the team’s red ink.“We have to turn this franchise around, and to do that, sometimes you have to take a step back to take a step forward,” Jordan said.Jordan has urged Johnson to spend more money — the Bobcats have the lowest payroll in the league — and Johnson insists he will spend more to make the Bobcats a winner.A big test comes this summer, when the team’s leading scorer, Gerald Wallace, can become a free agent and the leading rebounder, Emeka Okafor, is eligible for a new contract. Big-name free agents like Vince Carter could also be available.'"
"'07-04-15,'0','David Brooks (“The Fatalist,” column, April 12) tells us that John McCain believes that he has “an obligation to seek victory” in Iraq “as long as there is any chance of it.” But is there any chance of it? And is there anything — anything at all — that would persuade Senator McCain that victory is impossible?Certainly, it’s hard to hold out much hope of winning when things look as terrible as they do now, and when we haven’t even been given a consistent account of what would count as a “win.”Senator McCain’s insistence that things are getting better, that we are making progress — as with his recent Potemkin tour of a Baghdad marketplace — suggests that he’s more willing to abandon his grip on reality than to give up on this war. It’s almost as if he sees a triumph in Iraq as standing in for the victory he and his generation never achieved in Vietnam.That’s more straitjacket thinking than “straight talk,” if you ask me.Thank you, David Brooks, for setting the facts straight on John McCain. I served with him in a previous war where political incompetence was slightly exceeded only by that of President Bush, Vice President Dick Cheney and former Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld.'"
"'07-04-15,'0','WASHINGTON, April 13 — The Nuclear Regulatory Commission said Friday that it would not grant the operators of the Indian Point nuclear reactors an extension for the completion of an blackout-proof siren system, opening the way for what the agency called an “enforcement action.”The operator of the plant, Entergy Nuclear Northeast, said that in a test of the new system, 31 of 150 sirens failed to sound and that it could not meet a Sunday deadline. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 imposed a special requirement on Indian Point — which is situated in Buchanan, N.Y., 24 miles north of New York City, and has more people living within a 10-mile emergency planning zone than any other reactor in the country — for sirens with backup power supplies.The Nuclear Regulatory Commission issued a ruling in January 2006 mandating the sirens — activated by a system that uses the Internet and cellphones — and gave Entergy a year to comply. It subsequently granted an extension, until April 15.After the failure on Thursday, Entergy asked for an extension until August, but the commission staff said in a letter sent to the company on Friday that the problems it had encountered “were known or should have been known by Entergy” when it requested the first extension.The old siren system, which runs off the electricity grid like the ones at other reactors, remains in service.'"
"'07-04-15,'0','The stock market rose again last week, fighting off a decline on Wednesday brought about by the release of the minutes of the last Federal Reserve policy meeting.Those minutes made explicit the Fed’s view that inflation, not a possible economic slowdown, is the biggest threat to the economy — and that an increase in short-term interest rates is possible to curb inflation. Investors hoping for a rate cut presumably sold off some stock on Wednesday, but the market rebounded smartly on the next two days.Merck, the drug company, gained 10.25 percent for the week, the strongest performance among the Dow industrials.The company on Friday reported a 13 percent jump in first quarter profits, outstripping the expectations of analysts as well as its own forecasts.For the week, the Dow Jones industrial average gained 51.93 points, or 0.4 percent, to close at 12,612.13.

"'07-04-15,'0','Since two osteopathic physicians in Chicago, Ronald M. Klatz and Robert M. Goldman, founded it 15 years ago, the academy has spun its teachings into a lucrative enterprise that claims 20,000 members, runs a Web site (www.worldhealth.net), worldwide conventions and medical education programs that award board certifications in “anti-aging regenerative medicine.” Along the way, the academy has also become a consistent focus of criticism, derided by an establishment that calls anti-aging medicine quackery or hype, says growth hormone is dangerous and labels the academy’s promotions as medically and legally specious.“The whole idea of anti-aging medicine is controversial,” said Dr. Robert N. Butler, who was director of the National Institute on Aging, a federal agency, from 1976 to 1982. “On the good side, it encourages healthy behaviors. On the other side, it sells things like human growth hormone, which is harmful.”Medical research has tended to support the view that growth hormone’s risks outweigh any potential anti-aging benefits. Under federal law, the substance is illegal to use except for treating childhood growth disorders, AIDS and a rare adult hormone deficiency. But Dr. Klatz and Dr. Goldman have argued that aging is a disease that causes the pituitary gland to gradually produce less growth hormone. Therefore, they say in books, articles and speeches that hormone replacement therapy at low doses is legal and beneficial in “properly diagnosed deficient adults.”Dr. Klatz, who is 51 and the academy’s president, and Dr. Goldman, 52, its chairman, declined to be interviewed for this article. But in response to written questions through their lawyer, they said the 1990 federal law making it a felony to prescribe growth hormone for “off label” uses was aimed specifically at athletic abuse and nothing else. Neither of the doctors is mentioned in the recent indictments, and they also have not been accused of any wrongdoing in connection with the investigation.But many of the individuals and companies cited in the indictments have been involved with the academy and its conventions over the years. Dr. Klatz and Dr. Goldman would not comment on the investigations, saying they barely knew the suspects or the nature of their businesses. They say they neither prescribe nor distribute growth hormone, and advocate doing so only in accordance with state and federal laws and after a proper physical examination, not as an Internet purchase.They also say that pharmacies and individuals indicted in the investigation will no longer exhibit, sponsor or advertise at academy conventions and have already been removed from the academy’s Web site. Pharmacies and individuals had been paying $150 to $750 to be listed in the academy’s directory and $3,695 to $22,000 to buy display booths at its conventions.Despite the controversy surrounding them, Dr. Klatz and Dr. Goldman have grown wealthy through their stewardship of the academy and as leading anti-aging evangelists, building their business on books like “Grow Young With HGH,” disputed science and on people’s perennial — indeed, ageless — fear of growing old. They recently sold an 80 percent stake in their conventions business for as much as $49 million to the Tarsus Group, a London media concern.Dr. Klatz and Dr. Goldman are not afraid to take on their critics. In the last few years, they have been embroiled in legal disputes — with the State of Illinois, over offshore medical degrees they received in the late 1990s, and with professional critics whom they sued for giving them a “silver fleece” award in 2004 for promotion of questionable anti-aging products. (That suit was settled last November; its terms are confidential.)Self-described mavericks, Dr. Klatz and Dr. Goldman dismiss their critics as biased toward “the old-school medical establishment” and say that the medical establishment’s current gerontology practices pessimistically promote “a cult of death.”Hormones, including steroids and human-growth treatments, have captured the imaginations and bodies of athletes and others for many decades now, for the all-too-visible reason that they promote rippling, strapping muscular bulk and enhance performance. The hormone movement gained traction after a 1990 article in The New England Journal of Medicine said that a six-month study of 12 men, ages 61 to 81, who took HGH had less body fat and more lean body mass compared with a control group that did not take the hormone.More recently, however, advocates also have promoted growth hormones as the modern fountain of youth. The expansion of the anti-aging movement is being fed by several factors — among them, graying baby boomers, growing enthusiasm for physical fitness, interest in alternative medical treatments, and, some analysts say, many doctors’ efforts to compensate for income lost to managed care. The market for drugs to control and treat diseases of aging and for appearance-related products and services is expected to reach $71 billion a year by 2009, according to BCC Research, a market research company in Wellesley, Mass.Government and industry officials estimate that 25,000 to 30,000 Americans take injections of growth hormone for anti-aging purposes, paying up to $1,000 a month. And investigators say that the hormone, like many pharmaceuticals, is increasingly being bought on the Internet. State and federal law enforcement officials have focused on doctors who may have written prescriptions without seeing patients and on businesses that may have illegally trafficked in HGH.Some of the legal parameters around promoting and dispensing HGH are nebulous. Steven D. Silverman, an assistant director of compliance at the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, part of the Food and Drug Administration, says that people advocating growth hormone for anti-aging purposes “may be engaged in protected speech.” But, he adds, “if a doctor or pharmacy is actually dispensing this product for anti-aging purposes, that’s different and it may be illegal.”Recent research underscores growth hormone’s potential dangers. This year, in the Annals of Internal Medicine, a review of 31 randomized, controlled studies concluded that “risks far outweigh benefits when it is used as an anti-aging treatment in healthy older adults.” Side effects, according to the National Institutes of Health, may include diabetes, hypertension, hardening of the arteries and abnormal growth of bones or internal organs.FOR his part, Dr. Klatz challenges the concerns of the Annals of Internal Medicine about possible risks of HGH, contending that thousands of other studies showed “clear benefits” at lower doses; he compares using the hormone to using insulin for treating diabetics.He says HGH slows down aging by improving lean muscle mass, reducing body fat and increasing energy. The hormone affects metabolic processes in many ways, according to Genentech, the company that developed the first synthetic growth hormone in 1981. But while Genentech and other pharmaceutical suppliers, on the advice of regulators, emphasize that HGH should be given only for government-approved uses like dwarfism, Dr. Klatz and Dr. Goldman have pushed it onto the frontiers of anti-aging.“They have led the charge to educate in a realm that pharmaceutical companies won’t,” said Dr. Mark L. Gordon, a family practitioner in Encino, Calif. Asked how important Dr. Klatz and Dr. Goldman were in the anti-aging world, he responded: “as figureheads, extremely.”But Dr. Stephen Barrett, a senior member of the National Council Against Health Fraud, a nonprofit advocacy group that operates the quackwatch.org Web site, says the academy has misrepresented research on growth hormone and promotes questionable products.Dr. Barrett dismisses the medicinal value of the academy’s work and says its operations are more akin to Fort Knox than anything else. “I think it’s basically a money-making machine for Klatz and Goldman,” he said.No mainstream medical association like the American Board of Medical Specialties or the American Medical Association recognizes the academy’s board certification — though Dr. Klatz and Dr. Goldman say they are currently asking for A.B.M.S. approval. Doctors seeking certification from the academy must pay $3,440, study three books partly written or edited by Dr. Klatz and Dr. Goldman, and pass a multiple-choice test, chart review and oral exam.While the academy has certified hundreds of doctors, some who were once involved with the anti-aging movement have distanced themselves from the work of Dr. Klatz and Dr. Goldman. Dr. L. Stephen Coles, a researcher at the University of California, Los Angeles, recalled the excitement when he first joined the doctors and about 10 other physicians near Cancún, Mexico, in 1992 to talk about hormones and aging. Growth hormone is legal in Mexico, and some enthusiastic users lived there at the time.“I remember saying this is really important, this is what medicine will be in the next five years,” Dr. Coles recalled. He has changed his mind. Now, he says, “Growth hormone is risky, and I’d like to see long-term studies.”Dr. Klatz and Dr. Goldman are graduates of osteopathic colleges in Iowa and Illinois, respectively. Osteopaths, who represent about 6 percent of the nation’s licensed physicians, focus on holistic health treatments and the muscular-skeletal system and also perform functions of medical doctors like prescribing drugs and performing surgery.Through his lawyer, Dr. Goldman said that he had received two doctoral degrees from “distance learning programs,” which he said had required “work with a mentor, textbook reading and testing.” A fitness buff, he says in a biography posted on www.worldhealth.net that he has held world records for one-armed push-ups (321) and consecutive sit-ups (13,500).Dr. Klatz was working at a Wisconsin clinic in 1992 when he was injured in an automobile accident. After diagnosis of a cervical fracture, severe headaches, cognitive problems and a wrist injury, he spent the next six and a half years living in part on about $500,000 in disability payments, according to court records. During those years, he and Dr. Goldman, whom he first met in 1981, started the academy, working in a quasi-Gothic building in the Lincoln Park neighborhood of Chicago.Both men received medical degrees in 1998 from the Central American Health Sciences University in Belize, without, they acknowledged, ever having studied in the country. Dr. Klatz and Dr. Goldman say through their lawyer that they earned their medical degrees with transfer credit from previous academic work and a year in clinical rotations in Mexican hospitals.Licensing authorities in Illinois did not recognize the Belize degrees, and in 2000 fined the doctors $5,000 each for adding M.D. after their names. They agreed to a cease-and-desist order with an exception: books already printed or being reprinted with the contractual requirement that they be identified as M.D.’s. They were also allowed to continue using the M.D. designation on their résumés.While the agreement states that they can lose their licenses for violating its terms, the doctors currently identify themselves as M.D.’s in recently published books, correspondence, their Web site and promotional materials for conferences, including one last summer in Chicago. They say through their lawyer that they are not violating the agreement because of a confidential superseding accord, but a spokeswoman for the Illinois Division of Professional Regulation says they are not permitted to designate themselves as M.D.’s in the state.Despite having their bona fides questioned in Illinois, the doctors have been able to use the academy and its conventions to promote the anti-aging wonders of human growth hormone. Along the way, many other companies have helped make the conventions successful, and some of them have been charged with illegally trafficking in growth hormone, according to indictments handed down in state and federal investigations of the HGH business.Among them are an Orlando concern, Signature Compounding Pharmacy, which was a sponsor and exhibitor at the Las Vegas convention; Dr. Robert G. Carlson, the medical director of the Palm Beach Rejuvenation Center, who moderated an anti-aging workshop in Las Vegas; and Dr. Claire D. Godfrey, an obstetrician-gynecologist who runs the Ageless Clinic in Orlando and gave a lecture on female hormones at the convention.Each of those parties has pleaded not guilty to the charges. Another sponsor and exhibitor in Las Vegas, Applied Pharmacy Services, is named in a sealed indictment in Alabama, according to its lawyer, who denied that the company had engaged in any illegal activity.IN Las Vegas last December, speakers told doctors how to diagnose mild hormone deficiencies so they could legally prescribe HGH. Dr. Gordon, the California physician, talked about diagnosing pituitary gland damage from brain trauma from slips, falls or sports injuries. A Long Island lawyer, Richard D. Collins, counseled that while growth hormone could not legally be prescribed for completely healthy people, it is permissible for disease symptoms stemming from the aging process.Mr. Collins is now a defense lawyer for Signature Pharmacy, one of the companies indicted in the recent case. (He did not respond to interview requests.)It is unclear what impact the investigations will have on the academy or on the careers of Dr. Klatz and Dr. Goldman — or whether it will dent the two men’s popularity in the anti-aging industry. As recently as two months ago, just before her business was raided and she was charged with illegal distribution of prescription drugs, Naomi Loomis, chief executive of Signature Pharmacy, offered a glowing testimonial saluting the academy on its Web site.“Since our company aligned with” the academy, she noted, “our success in the age management business has grown exponentially.”'"
"'07-04-15,'0','Because of these unknowables, no domestic medical authority, from the New York City Health Department to the American Urological Association, has a policy on adult circumcision yet.And, besides, there hasn’t been a groundswell of demand.“We haven’t gotten a lot of calls,” said Noel Alicea, a spokesman for Gay Men’s Health Crisis, which runs a hotline.“Not a one,” said Tokes Osubu, executive director of Gay Men of African Descent.“A few,” said Mark McLaurin, executive director of the New York State Black Gay Network. “The first ones wanted to make sure that it wasn’t going to be mandatory. And then there were others who said ‘Tell me more — how much does this reduce my risk?’ ”Mr. McLaurin said he would advise most gay men to “hold off until we have more data.”But, he added, “for someone who was predominantly or exclusively a top, and said he was really having a hard time reducing his risk by practicing safe sex — I’d have a hard time recommending against it.”But, he quickly added, he was certain that few men in his network would want it.“We’ve had a hard time recruiting black and Latino men even for vaccine trials,” he said.“Because of everything from Tuskegee on up,” he explained — referring to the notorious medical experiment in which black men with syphilis were left untreated for decades — many black Americans mistrust the medical establishment.In Africa, it is relatively easy to talk men into getting circumcised, said Daniel Halperin, an AIDS researcher at the Harvard School of Public Health who has interviewed hundreds of African men about sex, AIDS and local customs.Some tribes circumcise teenagers to welcome them to full manhood. Many men who can’t get enough water to bathe regularly think foreskins are unhygenic. And some, he said, “say circumcised men get all the women” because of a widespread belief that, with slightly lessened sensation, they can make love longer.For adult men, circumcision takes about 30 minutes, said Dr. Craig Niederberger, chief of male reproductive surgery at the University of Illinois at Chicago. It is an outpatient procedure and, like dental work, can be done with local injections of Novocain.“But with many men,” he added, “if you use the words ‘scalpel’ and ‘penis’ in the same sentence, they say ‘put me to sleep!’ So then we do it under general anesthesia.”There is no official national estimate of how many adults have the operation each year.Most of his patients have phimosis or balanitis — a painfully tight foreskin or swollen glans, which can become a crisis if urination is blocked.But, because he practices in a black Chicago neighborhood, some of his young, healthy patients are volunteers — perhaps the only demographic group of African-American men currently lining up for the operation.They are converts to Islam, which requires circumcision.“They come in very committed,” he said. “It’s a personal choice that’s very strong.”A spokeswoman for the Nation of Islam, the Black Muslim group also based in south Chicago, said she presumed most adherents were circumcised at birth, “but I’m the wrong person to ask,” she added. A male official she suggested for comment did not return a phone call.In any case, that appears to be the answer: Until more trials are done, it’s going to take a medical emergency. Or divine intervention.'"
"'07-04-15,'0','On May 22, 2000, a tour bus struck and killed Randolph Walker, a 71-year-old actor, as he crossed 45th Street on the west side of Ninth Avenue. The tour guide later testified that he and the driver had been looking ahead as they turned onto the side street, yet saw no one in the crosswalk.On Feb. 23, Nina Petrow, 55, was killed in the same spot by another tour bus turning off the avenue.The second death has revived neighbors’ long-held suspicions about a pair of phone booths, joined into a single roofed cabin, that sit perhaps 12 feet north of the intersection. They say the double booths can briefly block pedestrians from the view of drivers turning onto the street.“After this second instance, we all went, ‘Well, duh,’ ” said Renée Stanley, a stage manager who lives on 44th Street near Ninth Avenue and saw Mr. Walker get hit. “Once is an accident. Twice, there’s a direct line.”Lee Compton, chairman of Community Board 4, has asked the city’s Department of Information Technology and Telecommunications to remove the phone booths, calling it “troubling” that “an 8-foot-tall-by-6-foot-wide visual barrier was placed so close to this dangerous intersection.”According to Nicholas Sbordone, a spokesman for the technology department, the phone booths’ placement complies with city rules and the booths’ operator, Telebeam Telecommunications Corporation, has disputed the contention that they are “a nuisance.”Osmin Montjovier, who sells books and records from a table at the intersection, counsels pedestrians to be wary. “Watch this lady here,” Mr. Montjovier said as a woman and a turning taxi neared the intersection from different directions.'"
"'07-04-15,'0','In fact, in periods since 1955 when the P/E of the S.& P. 500 has been 17 or more, stocks, on average, have declined by 2.3 percent, annualized, in the six months following the first Fed rate cut in a market cycle.After that initial decline, however, the market has generally recovered: stocks have returned 6.2 percent, annualized, over the 18 months after the first Fed rate cut.But don’t relax just yet.Conditions in the bond market make the current prospects for the stock market worse than these figures suggest, Mr. Hussman said. At the moment, there is an inverted yield curve — bond market terminology for a situation in which short-term interest rates are higher than longer-term rates.Historically, when all of these bond and stock market conditions are combined, as they were when the Fed first cut rates in 1968 and 2001, stocks have been especially weak. In the first six months after cuts in those years, they declined by an average of 6.8 percent, annualized. And over the 18 months after the first cuts, they lost an average of 9.3 percent, annualized.Mr. Hussman says he is not convinced that the Fed, still concerned about inflation, will ease interest rates anytime soon. And if it doesn’t, he said, the outlook for stocks may be worse yet. “In my view,” he said, “the stock market risk/reward ratio is not appealing at this time.” But his bearish assessment of the stock market’s prospects is not universally held.Laszlo Birinyi Jr., president of Birinyi Associates in Westport, Conn., for example, says he expects the stock market to rise this year, whether or not the Fed cuts rates. Private equity firms have accumulated a huge reservoir of capital that they will continue to deploy to acquire publicly traded companies, he said, and that should buoy the markets.“I think we’re in a bull market,” he said. “It will continue for the rest of the year. The market is going to do well, with interruptions and bumps along the way.”He acknowledged that the growth rate for corporate earnings is declining, a development that has generally been a drag on the market. But he said that analysts’ estimates had already “come down so sharply” that further bad news on that front wasn’t likely to have much market impact.In early January, analysts tracked by Thomson Financial were forecasting an 8.7 percent increase in first-quarter earnings for the S.& P. 500 companies.But since then, the aggregate forecast has been ratcheted all the way down to 3.4 percent, said David Dropsey, senior research analyst at Thomson. Since January, the forecast for full-year earnings growth has been trimmed to 6.2percent from 9.3 percent.David M. Jones, president of the economic consulting firm DMJ Advisors, says he believes that “in the short run — over the next month or two or three — the bulls win out” as hopes for a Fed rate cut overwhelm concern over falling profits.But three to six months out, Mr. Jones says, as the housing downturn proves “longer and deeper than generally expected,” growing evidence of a slowing economy and decelerating profit growth will prompt a correction, in his view.“The rate of profit growth will slow more than expected,” he said.And what if the Fed defies market expectations and does not cut rates at all this year? In that case, Mr. Jones shares Mr. Hussman’s bearishness.“If the Fed does nothing, it would mean an even bigger market decline,” Mr. Jones said. “Beware of too much bullish talk. You want to be careful with your investments and be aware of the possibility of a big correction.”JOE BATTIPAGLIA, chief investment officer at Ryan Beck & Company, has a similar view. He is not sure that companies can match even the current earnings growth forecasts.“Earnings growth expectations for the S.& P. 500 may be too high,” Mr. Battipaglia said.Noting that net new borrowing by consumers was down 38 percent in the fourth quarter of 2006, versus the period a year earlier, he sees the prospect of a “consumer-led pullback” for the first time in 15 years.This would hurt the stock market, he said, with the S.& P. dropping 5 percent or more.If Fed rate cuts won’t necessarily signal a market upturn, where should investors focus?Corporate profit trends are a fairly reliable indicator, Mr. Battipaglia said. “The first sign of a turn-up in the corporate profit growth rate,” he said, is a bullish signal that has “great predictive accuracy.”Such a turn-up, he added, could materialize toward year-end.'"
"'07-04-15,'0','Almost all the buyers already own digital cameras, but the new S.L.R.’s, with their quick auto focus, lighter weight and cheaper-than-last-year price, prove too tempting.And buyers can use the money-making potential of their new businesses to justify their purchases. Acquiring a name for the business seems simple; many women just tack the word “photography” after their own names. Many have no need for a studio, because most of the pictures are shot in natural light outside, or at the client’s home.Marketing is often by word of mouth. When Jodie Otte (of J. Otte Photography) started her full-time business two years ago, she printed business cards after every photo session, knowing that her clients would pass them along if the cards featured pictures of their own children.Other women have engineered portrait parties, where several families get together and the budding photographer snaps portraits of the children at play. If the parents like the results, they tell their friends and playgroups, and the photographer’s phone starts ringing.The rise of photography start-ups is helping other businesses as well. BluDomain, a company that designs Web site templates specifically for photographers, introduces about 100 new sites for clients each month. For $800, a new photographer can have her portfolio designed as a flash-driven, fully editable site with proofing galleries and video.Laura Brophy (of Laura Brophy Photography) started her part-time business last year in Canandaigua, N.Y., with a Canon EOS 20D and a Web site from BigBlackBag.com, which cost her $25 a month. Now, with brisk business in high school senior portraits, thanks mostly to friends of her teenage children spreading the word on MySpace.com, she is upgrading to a BluDomain site this month.Although there are no figures tracking start-up photography businesses, Dana Groves, director of marketing and communications at the Professional Photographers of America, says the industry has expanded rapidly in recent years. In response, the association in 2004 created a retreat called “Chicks Who Click;” this June, about 250 women will meet at the event in the Bahamas.Some past participants, discussing the retreats on an online forum, have said that there was too much emphasis on photographing children. But tapping into the children’s portrait market was exactly what Lauren Dawson (of Lauren Dawson Photography), who had a part-time photo business in Dallas for five years, wanted to do last fall when she moved to Boston with her husband. “I heard the market was wide open for children’s photographers, so I really wanted to get in with moms groups,” Ms. Dawson said. “Sometimes all you need is one person, that one person who knows everyone, to help you spread the word.”Because the overhead can be minimal — some business cards and a lot of chatting on playgrounds — and because many new photographers have either a full-time job or a husband with one, they can afford to charge less than professional photographers. The professionals, who assert that they offer better quality because of their experience and studio equipment, may charge from $50 to several hundred dollars for an 8-by-10-inch print.Some large studios and old-guard photographers are feeling undercut; the backlash is apparent on many photography message boards, where “MWAC” means Mom With a Camera.“It’s the established portrait studio guy who is scared that moms are taking cool photographs and selling them for $10 for an 8-by-10,” said Kirk Voclain, a portrait studio photographer in Louisiana who owns Pro4uM, a professional photographers message board that has been host for some battles between the old guard and moms new to the business.“The people who buy photographs are women,” he said. “A man only comes to my studio when a woman decides that she wants a picture of him. So if moms are driving all the photo sales, then it makes sense that all these new photographers armed with digital cameras are moms.”SETTING prices for children’s portraits can be daunting for people who are just starting in the business. Some feel that building relationships with their clients is more important than immediate profit.The new crop of photographers also tends to shy away from shooting weddings, even though they are lucrative jobs. Many cite a lack of creativity in posed wedding portraits and the pressure to document every moment of the big day. These photographers prefer the informal, low-pressure setting of snapping pictures while babies sleep or teenagers preen.“The biggest challenge facing women in the industry is business education,” said Ms. Groves of the Professional Photographers of America. “They tend to see themselves as artists before small-business owners, so they don’t set their prices or invest with profit in mind.”Many women try to fit photography around full-time jobs and full-time parenting.“Lots of mom-with-a-camera businesses fail because they try to do it around the edges,” said Mrs. Brophy, who has a preschool-age daughter and two teenagers and works as director of external relations at the Warner School of the University of Rochester in addition to running her weekend photography business. “Plus, women face a business dilemma when they have to ask their husbands if they can buy a new camera.”Unlike some women who have a casual relationship with the business side of photography, Mrs. Brophy has a marketing plan and has reinvested all her earnings in lenses, lights, backdrops for her home studio, brochures and her new BluDomain Web site. She also has her eye on a new Canon.As new digital cameras come to market, with lower prices and more features than last year’s models, new photographers cannot help yearning for the latest versions. Still, many are quick to say that the photographer’s eye matters much more than the camera, and that the ability to use technology and respond to light is what makes an image come to life.That is why they smile when some owners of fancy S.L.R.’s put their camera on automatic settings and then complain that their pictures look like ordinary snapshots, albeit with very high resolution.“Good photography is more about the photographer than the camera,” said Ms. Dawson, who has just started her business in Boston. “It’s about making people comfortable and finding the emotion in their faces. The camera is just a tool.”'"
"'07-04-15,'0','Despite the retro look of the tubes, their audio characteristics may give iPod-stored music an additional, welcome dimension. That’s because most people store their music in compressed formats rather than in “lossless” formats, where data is not removed. Given these limitations, said Mark Schubin, an engineer and media technology consultant, “a vacuum tube can deal with the degradation in a potentially better and more pleasant way than a non-vacuum-tube amplifier.”To enjoy a full range of sound, it’s still better to use lossless formats — vacuum tubes can’t restore data that’s been stripped away. But regardless of the storage format, “if you put an iPod into a docking station with good pre-amplification, it’s going to sound a lot better than putting it into a cheap one,” said David Chesky, a composer and co-owner of Chesky Records in Manhattan, which uses vacuum-tube-based recording equipment.The Cocoon isn’t cheap: it will sell for $649, said James A. Roth, managing director of Roth Audio. But in the costly world of high-end vacuum-tube audio equipment, that’s a relatively modest price. After the tubes in the Cocoon do the pre-amplification, the audio signal goes to a solid state amplifier for additional power.The Cocoon has audio inputs at the back for a CD player or a generic MP3 player. The docking station handles all types of iPods except the Shuffle. The units began shipping this month, Mr. Roth said.He has already introduced another brand of vacuum-tube amplifier to the United States market: the Fatman iTube ($649), distributed by Bluebird Music in Toronto. The Fatman has a different look than the Cocoon.“The Cocoon goes well on a desktop,” Mr. Roth said. “The Fatman is more for the living room.”The Fatman comes in two parts: an amplifier and a separate docking station. The vacuum tubes are covered by a grill that can be removed for an elegant look, but popped back on if fingers need to be protected from the tubes’ considerable heat. The Fatman has a 27-key remote control that handles not only standard functions like play and pause, but also treble volume, bass volume and even backlighting.The Fatman has two amber vacuum tubes, as well as a green tube. “I added that third, green tube for fun,” Mr. Roth said. “It shows you the music level. The higher you turn it up, the more it bounces up and down.”BOTH the Cocoon and the Fatman come with a pair of white cotton gloves, to be worn to protect the high-gloss metal surfaces from fingerprints during handling. To assemble and try out both machines, I donned a set of the gloves, as did a friend who helped me.The Cocoon hooks up easily to speakers, by using the red- and black-ringed connectors called banana plugs that come with it. We selected 110 volts as the setting for the transformer, rather than the 230 volts used abroad, and plugged the transformer into the AC wall jack.Then we turned on the transformer and started the machine. Gradually, the tubes began to glow. Then we popped my iPod into the dock and tried out recordings in both compressed and lossless formats. A Brahms sextet poured out in an impressive stream, even in the compressed version.Then we hooked up the Fatman. Unlike the Cocoon, it has a built-in transformer, and it was already set for 110 volts. After we connected the dock and the amp to the stereo speakers, plugged both components into the power outlet and flipped on the switch, the power light illuminated on the amp, but not on the docking station.After 15 minutes of testing the connections and manual controls, we finally noticed the remote control and tried it, feeling foolish not to have done this sooner. The blue indicator light on the docking station immediately flashed on, and we were in business.Jay Rein, president of Bluebird Music, said that ours was a common mistake. “If the blue power light does not automatically come up when you plug in the docking station, press the Power On button on the remote,” he advised in an e-mail message.The Cocoon, the Fatman and other vacuum-tube amplifiers for iPods are relative newcomers to the United States consumer market. For instance, Lyric HiFi in Manhattan, a center for high-end audio equipment, does not handle any vacuum tube-based docking stations. But Leonard Bellezza, co-owner, said the accessories might soon be popular.“Everybody has an iPod,” he said. “So anything you can attach to an iPod sells.”'"
"'07-04-15,'0','Don’t Be Fooled by the Bottle BillYour support for a proposed beverage-container law allowing the state to seize unredeemed deposits held by wholesalers (“Don’t Discard the Bottle Bill,” editorial, April 8) shows an apparent misunderstanding of how the law works now.We pay a 5-cent deposit on each beer or soda container. If we do not return them, we lose our nickels, the retailer does not pay a refund and the wholesaler still has our nickels. These nickels are the target of the proposal. The present law has another complication, often overlooked. The wholesaler keeps 5 cents for each unreturned container, but must pay 7 cents to the retailer for each container that is returned (refund of deposit plus mandatory 2-cent “handling fee”). Nobody gets rich doing that. There is no golden pot of nickels at the end of the bottle bill rainbow.If $150 million is removed from the deposit-refund circle by the state, how will it be replaced? Obviously, other parts of the system would contribute, including consumers. Nobody knows how much, probably about 3 or 4 cents extra for each container, above the deposit.Increasing the “handling fee” to 3.5 cents and imposing deposits upon nearly everything people drink, except milk, wine and alcohol, would be even worse for grocery shoppers.J. Henry Neale Jr.ScarsdaleThe writer was on the Temporary State Commission on Returnable Beverage Containers, 1983-85.Closing language in “Plea to a Group Home: Another Backyard, Please” (April 1) creates an impression that Westchester Arc is not fully committed to opening a residence at Del Rey Drive, Mount Vernon.If the commissioner for the State Office of Mental Retardation and Developmental Disabilities were to rule against our request for a group residence at that address, we would abide by the decision. If, however, the office rules in our favor and Mount Vernon appeals the decision to the State Supreme Court, Westchester Arc will aggressively defend its position in that forum.We are committed to the interests of the eight individuals with developmental disabilities who would live at that address. The city’s threat of legal action will not dissuade us.'"

"'07-04-15,'0','Mr. McQuillan, who has taught middle school and served as a superintendent in two Massachusetts districts, said that closing the achievement gap and working on ways to merge state accountability standards with federal standards were among the first issues he will tackle this week when he gets behind his desk. This includes outlining what actions he and the State Board of Education could take on a local level if a school were not making enough progress on student achievement levels, he said.“The conviction was that the accountability system we are working with needed more specificity and delineation,” he said.Another priority for Mr. McQuillan is preschool education. The state board has outlined an aggressive five-year preschool goal intended to help tackle the achievement gap by helping to provide quality education to young children during the crucial early years. “We can move toward prevention of reading failure and dropouts instead of using schools as remediation,” he said.Mr. McQuillan said he would also like to extend the school day or year for struggling students. This could be achieved with pilot schools, similar to those that have been started in Boston, that offer extra and flexible hours, he said.The state may also consider a standard used in Massachusetts for special education instruction that puts the emphasis on providing services within the schools to students with special needs, he said.“Everyone is in agreement that if you can bring the services to students to the closest point where they live, it’s really far better,” said Mr. McQuillan, who served on a special education collaborative committee in Massachusetts.He said the state’s lawsuit against the federal government on No Child Left Behind funding was pursued for legitimate reasons. He will defer to the state attorney general to settle the case, he said, but would like to see Connecticut ease tensions with the federal government.“I’d like to work more closely with the federal government,” Mr. McQuillan said. “There was a strain that arose over this.”Regarding the budget, he said that Governor Rell’s proposal to give more education money to towns by lifting the cap on education cost-sharing funds would be beneficial. The proposal would overturn a law that requires that any additional money designated for education be spent on education and would allow towns with high per-pupil expenditures to use the additional funds for property tax relief.“This infusion of money is badly needed for local cities and towns across the state and will help immeasurably the overall commitment to education,” Mr. McQuillan said. “Standards will rise along with additional dollars.”Education advocates who have met Mr. McQuillan said they were impressed by his spirit of cooperation. “He had a real sense of what was going on here and what we needed to do to bring our state to the next level,” said Robert Rader, executive director of the Connecticut Association of Boards of Education. “He wanted to hear everybody’s opinions before he would move forward.”'"
"'07-04-15,'0','FINDING affordable housing in — the nation’s seventh-most expensive county, according to census data — is never easy. Even long-term residents of properties built with county, state or federal subsidies inevitably face steeper housing costs when their homes eventually revert to market rates.Some 240 properties have already lost their price caps this year, and 4,000 more in 11 communities will soon follow suit.Last month, County Executive proposed the creation of a land trust whose goal would be to preserve affordable housing in perpetuity. A coalition of 15 developers, housing advocates, bankers, lenders and county officials served as advisers to create the trust, which is expected to be operating by July. The trust will set up a bank of land, donated by towns, villages or cities; developers will be able to build affordable housing for rent or sale on parcels from that bank, which will remain the property of the trust, rented out in 99-year leases.“There is not enough, and a decreasing amount, of subsidized housing in Yonkers,” said Jon Shenk, executive director of the Cluster Housing Resource Center, a nonprofit housing advocacy group. “It’s a problem.” Residents of subsidized housing who soon face higher market rates fear losing their homes, he said.Tanya Mahboob, a tenant at the Whitney Young apartment complex in Yonkers since 1999, has heard that her rent will probably rise $300 from the $1,300 a month (30 percent of her salary) she now pays for the affordable-housing three-bedroom, two-bathroom apartment she shares with her three sons. None of her sons, ages 18, 19 and 26, have full-time jobs, but all are now looking for work to help her financially, she said. “It would be scary for me if they weren’t here to help,” she said. “I’d have to look at moving or take on a second job.” Ms. Mahboob, who works as a project manager for , called the rent increase “a big change a lot of people weren’t prepared for.”'"
"'07-04-15,'0','“It’s such a comfort to hear that what you’re feeling isn’t abnormal, and to be able to talk, not just about the joys of motherhood, but about the challenges,” Ms. Blair said.The network’s treasurer, Debbie Aglietti, who runs Northeast Doulas in , said that in the last five years, she had seen an increase in postpartum depression. Ms. Aglietti, from her experience as a birth and postpartum doula (a coach or supporter) with more than 350 families, estimates that one family in five suffers from the phenomenon, which ranges from an inability to get out of bed to “not liking their baby.”The birth network, founded in 2004, is unusual in the scope of its services and the interconnection of its practitioners, members say. More than 40 people, mostly women practicing in Westchester, Putnam, Rockland, Sullivan, Orange and Dutchess Counties, belong to the birth network, which is made up of birth educators, doulas, therapists, midwives, pediatricians, acupuncturists and specialists in lactation and breast-feeding, among others. The network holds bimonthly meetings, and because of their regular contact, practitioners can refer clients knowledgeably.“I feel very strongly that I want to know the person I’m referring people to,” Ms. Herron said. “At our network meetings, we really get to know each other and our backgrounds.”In 2006, the network’s members saw more than 2,000 mothers and children, some 30 percent referred by other members of the network, according to Melissa Creighton, a co-president of the network and a doula training to be a midwife.The personal referral was important for Ms. Blair, who said she was “not at a point in my life where I could have found the postpartum group myself, or done the research; I hadn’t slept.”Ms. Merle-Fishman said that “what’s special is that all these disciplines are brought together, and we all know and help each other.”“It’s networking in the modern age,” she said. “But unlike sitting down at a computer, these women are being personally supported.”Ms. Blair is expecting another child in October, and if her family hadn’t moved to Cold Spring, she said she would be using the same midwifery group. “There’s no bigger change on earth than becoming a mother,” she said. “Not a lot of people know that this network for support exists.”'"
"'07-04-15,'0','Because it’s not possible in the real world to test theories about events that never happened, most of what we know about cumulative advantage has been worked out using mathematical models and computer simulations — an approach that is often criticized for glossing over the richness of real human behavior. Fortunately, the explosive growth of the Internet has made it possible to study human activity in a controlled manner for thousands or even millions of people at the same time. Recently, my collaborators, Matthew Salganik and Peter Dodds, and I conducted just such a Web-based experiment. In our study, published last year in Science, more than 14,000 participants registered at our Web site, Music Lab (www.musiclab.columbia.edu), and were asked to listen to, rate and, if they chose, download songs by bands they had never heard of. Some of the participants saw only the names of the songs and bands, while others also saw how many times the songs had been downloaded by previous participants. This second group — in what we called the “social influence” condition — was further split into eight parallel “worlds” such that participants could see the prior downloads of people only in their own world. We didn’t manipulate any of these rankings — all the artists in all the worlds started out identically, with zero downloads — but because the different worlds were kept separate, they subsequently evolved independently of one another.This setup let us test the possibility of prediction in two very direct ways. First, if people know what they like regardless of what they think other people like, the most successful songs should draw about the same amount of the total market share in both the independent and social-influence conditions — that is, hits shouldn’t be any bigger just because the people downloading them know what other people downloaded. And second, the very same songs — the “best” ones — should become hits in all social-influence worlds.What we found, however, was exactly the opposite. In all the social-influence worlds, the most popular songs were much more popular (and the least popular songs were less popular) than in the independent condition. At the same time, however, the particular songs that became hits were different in different worlds, just as cumulative-advantage theory would predict. Introducing social influence into human decision making, in other words, didn’t just make the hits bigger; it also made them more unpredictable.So does a listener’s own independent reaction to a song count for anything? In fact, intrinsic “quality,” which we measured in terms of a song’s popularity in the independent condition, did help to explain success in the social-influence condition. When we added up downloads across all eight social-influence worlds, “good” songs had higher market share, on average, than “bad” ones. But the impact of a listener’s own reactions is easily overwhelmed by his or her reactions to others. The song “Lockdown,” by 52metro, for example, ranked 26th out of 48 in quality; yet it was the No. 1 song in one social-influence world, and 40th in another. Overall, a song in the Top 5 in terms of quality had only a 50 percent chance of finishing in the Top 5 of success.In our artificial market, therefore, social influence played as large a role in determining the market share of successful songs as differences in quality. It’s a simple result to state, but it has a surprisingly deep consequence. Because the long-run success of a song depends so sensitively on the decisions of a few early-arriving individuals, whose choices are subsequently amplified and eventually locked in by the cumulative-advantage process, and because the particular individuals who play this important role are chosen randomly and may make different decisions from one moment to the next, the resulting unpredictability is inherent to the nature of the market. It cannot be eliminated either by accumulating more information — about people or songs — or by developing fancier prediction algorithms, any more than you can repeatedly roll sixes no matter how carefully you try to throw the die.This, obviously, presents challenges for producers and publishers — but it also has a more general significance for our understanding of how cultural markets work. Even if you think most people are tasteless or ignorant, it’s natural to believe that successful songs, movies, books and artists are somehow “better,” at least in the democratic sense of a competitive market, than their unsuccessful counterparts, that Norah Jones and Madonna deserve to be as successful as they are if only because “that’s what the market wanted.” What our results suggest, however, is that because what people like depends on what they think other people like, what the market “wants” at any point in time can depend very sensitively on its own history: there is no sense in which it simply “reveals” what people wanted all along. In such a world, in fact, the question “Why did X succeed?” may not have any better answer than the one given by the publisher of Lynne Truss’s surprise best seller, “Eats, Shoots & Leaves,” who, when asked to explain its success, replied that “it sold well because lots of people bought it.”This lesson is not limited to cultural products either. Economists like Brian Arthur and Paul David have long argued that similar mechanisms affect the competition between technologies (like operating systems or fax machines) that display what are called “network effects,” meaning that the attractiveness of a technology increases with the number of people using it. But even in markets that don’t exhibit obvious network effects (like markets for low-carb or organically produced food, fuel-efficient vehicles or alternative energy technologies), sudden shifts in consumer demand can still arise, persist and then shift again. These shifts often come as surprises but are soon explained away as mere reflections of changing public sentiments. Yet while in some sense these markets do reflect what people want, that is true only of what they want right now. If markets not only reveal our preferences but also modify them, then the relation between what we want now and what we wanted before — or what we will want in the future — becomes deeply ambiguous.Our desire to believe in an orderly universe leads us to interpret the uncertainty we feel about the future as nothing but a consequence of our current state of ignorance, to be dispelled by greater knowledge or better analysis. But even a modest amount of randomness can play havoc with our intuitions. Because it is always possible, after the fact, to come up with a story about why things worked out the way they did — that the first “Harry Potter” really was a brilliant book, even if the eight publishers who rejected it didn’t know that at the time — our belief in determinism is rarely shaken, no matter how often we are surprised. But just because we now know that something happened doesn’t imply that we could have known it was going to happen at the time, even in principle, because at the time, it wasn’t necessarily going to happen at all.That doesn’t mean we should stop trying to anticipate the future, any more than we should stop trying to make sense of the past. But it does mean that we should treat both the predictions and the explanations we are served — whether about the next hit single, the next great company or even the next war — with the skepticism they deserve.'"
"'07-04-15,'0','Over the years, the H-1B visa, which allows a person to work in the United States for three years and can be renewed for an additional three, has been used by many people as a steppingstone to becoming a permanent resident. Traditionally, about half of all H-1B holders eventually get green cards, immigration experts say.Yet the major outsourcing companies, while seeking thousands of H-1B visas, are asking for relative handfuls of green cards, according to government figures.The statistics marshaled by Mr. Hira are not absolutely conclusive. The reported company-by-company numbers are for H-1B visas requested, not granted, but that is because the government does not publish visa counts by company. Since the visas are granted on a first-come-first-served basis, it seems reasonable that the companies seeking the most visas would, proportionately, get the most.It is not just critics like Mr. Hira who point to the crucial role that the H-1B visa program plays in the fast-growing global outsourcing industry. “It has become the outsourcing visa,” said Kamal Nath, the commerce minister of India.But is that a bad thing? Many economists say that paving the way for more efficient global trade in technology services should be a policy goal, and that the American economy will be more competitive and create more jobs as a result. Technology services like software programming and maintenance, they say, are an “input,” in economic terms, in industries from banking to manufacturing.It used to be that all the parts in a car or a computer were made in a single country; now they are manufactured wherever it is most efficient. The same thing is happening in technology services. “We’re seeing this growing international division of labor in services just as we saw in manufacturing decades ago,” said Aaditya Mattoo, an economist at the World Bank.Still, the issue behind the H-1B controversy is how a nation devises a policy to benefit from global trade in technology services while treating its own workers fairly. The proposals before Congress range from significantly expanding the visa quota to tightening rules to protect American workers.This month, the government announced that it had received more petitions for H-1B visas in one day than it could grant in the entire fiscal year that begins in October. It received 150,000 petitions; the current visa cap is 65,000. Technology lobbying groups declared that the immediate overflow demand for H-1B visas was proof of the skills shortage in the United States and the need for a sharply higher visa limit. But some immigration policy experts and economists say that this argument fails a simple test of economics. It is not surprising, they say, that global companies — including I.B.M., Microsoft and Oracle — that benefit from the H-1B program would like to see it enlarged. “There is no labor market test, using technically sound criteria, to determine whether or not there is a shortage,” said David M. Hart, an associate professor of public policy at George Mason University. The measures, Mr. Hart suggests, would include recent wage trends and unemployment rates in specific professions.Other suggested changes include phasing out caps but holding auctions for H-1B visas in, say, lots of 30,000. After the first auction, the bidding for the next batch would begin at the high end of the initial sale’s prices. In 1994, a commission appointed by Congress recommended letting companies hire skilled foreign workers easily if the employers paid a $10,000-a-person fee that would go into a fund to train domestic workers. And there might be a limit on the number of visas that any one company can get.“How to match policies to people in this emerging global labor market is something we really haven’t thought through yet,” said B. Lindsay Lowell, director of policy studies at the Institute for the Study of International Migration at Georgetown University. The current system, he said, tends to depend too much on the companies and how they use the complicated work-visa program.Microsoft, it seems, is paying its H-1B holders quite well — a median salary of $82,500 for new visa applicants, whose wages over the subsequent three to six years could well rise to about the $100,000 Mr. Gates mentioned. And in fiscal 2006, Microsoft applied for 1,181 green cards and 4,471 H-1B’s, a ratio of more than 26 percent. For the leading Indian outsourcing companies, the ratio was less than 1 percent.“Microsoft may well be using the program to bring in the best and the brightest,” Mr. Hira said. “But it’s definitely not representative of how the H-1B program is being used today.”'"
"'07-04-15,'0','But investors should pay closer attention to the bankruptcy process, given how many formerly highflying subprime mortgage lenders are teetering on the edge of collapse or are already falling apart.According to the study, companies that sold out during the bankruptcy process received an average of 35 percent of their book value, or net worth. Conversely, companies that reorganized did so at a value of 80 percent of book value. That’s some spread. And it was found across industries as diverse as retailing, energy, airlines, entertainment and technology.“Companies that file bankruptcy have internal incentive types of problems that make them willing to sell their property for less than it’s worth,” Mr. LoPucki said in an interview last week. “The judges are supposed to control it. But they are making rulings that are favorable to the people that bring them cases, so they will continue to bring them cases.”Big bankruptcy cases, of course, generate enormous fees and revenues for the court system. And judges are increasingly willing to let companies and their lawyers call the shots in these proceedings, Mr. LoPucki said.This phenomenon was explored extensively in Mr. LoPucki’s 2005 book, “Courting Failure: How Competition for Big Cases Is Corrupting the Bankruptcy Courts.” He said competition has been pursued most aggressively in the bankruptcy courts in Delaware and New York City.In filing for bankruptcies, companies can choose the court where their case will be heard. New Century Financial, a subprime lender that filed for bankruptcy protection earlier this month, is a case in point. Based in California and incorporated in Maryland, New Century chose to file its case in Delaware, where a subsidiary is incorporated. A company spokeswoman did not respond to an interview request inquiring about their choice of venue for their bankruptcy filing.“This is a very sophisticated game,” Mr. LoPucki said. “The judges are not blatantly favoring one party over another; it’s very subtle. But when you see the pattern — and I see them in the cases — then you realize there is something very wrong going on. The parties who bring them the cases are getting what they want.” The LoPucki-Doherty study is a compelling rebuttal to academics who have argued in recent years that auctions were more effective than reorganizations at extracting value from a bankrupt company. Trust in the market’s ability to price assets rationally was behind that view; not surprisingly, bankruptcy sales have grown considerably.Especially popular, Mr. LoPucki said, are sales under Section 363 of the federal bankruptcy code, which allows managers to sell a company quickly without giving creditors the chance to vote on the deal or providing a detailed disclosure statement required under reorganization law. Compounding the problem is that once a judge approves a sale, appeals are not available.As it turns out, “the market” that is entrusted to price a bankrupt company may also be subject to what economists call an “agency problem” — characterized by managers and other parties putting their own interests ahead of those of owners or creditors in bankruptcy cases.Consider the October 2001 bankruptcy of Polaroid. In April 2002, its co-chief executives sold the company to the sole private bidder for approximately $465 million, a price widely criticized as too low and far below the $1.8 billion in assets that Polaroid had listed in its bankruptcy petition.The creditors raised their objections to the judge overseeing the case in Delaware, arguing that the company would be worth more in reorganization. The judge approved the deal nonetheless. After the sale closed, Polaroid disclosed that the co-chiefs had each received stock in the acquiring company valued at $3 million to $4 million. Ka-ching!Mr. LoPucki argues that investment bankers hired to sell a company have few incentives to maximize the bids they receive. Investment bankers may not think it worth their while to curry favor with the sellers who hired them because the companies are going out of business, he speculates. Furthermore, underpricing an asset creates value for the buyer, who may then compensate the banker with future business, he says.While bankers often receive “success” fees totaling 1 percent of a company’s sale price, Mr. LoPucki said a fee resulting from a higher price is often not worth the extra effort required to achieve it. Better to go on to the next deal.THAT leaves creditors and judges to make sure the process is effective, Mr. LoPucki said. Too often the creditors are powerless and the judges passive or eager to please.As a result, Mr. LoPucki said, bankruptcy courts are not fulfilling their obligation to ensure that the best interests of the debtor’s estate are being served, the study concluded. “There are billions of dollars being pulled out of this system,” he said. The Michigan Law Review plans to publish the LoPucki-Doherty study in November. A copy is at www.law.ucla.edu/docs/lopuckidohertyfire_4-11-07.pdf.That creditors would be treated like steerage passengers on the S.S. Bankruptcy is not really surprising. The practices described in the study and the results they bring are completely in keeping with the treatment that many public company shareholders receive today from me-first managers. Whether the company is thriving or diving, being an insider has never been better.'"
"'07-04-15,'0','He said that if the Bush administration’s plan had not produced visible signs of progress by the time a McCain presidency began, he might be forced — if only by the will of public opinion — to end American involvement in Iraq.“I do believe that history shows us Americans will not continue to support an overseas engagement involving the loss of American lives for an unlimited period of time unless they see some success,” he added. “And then, when they run out of patience, they will demand that we get out.”Mr. McCain, an Arizona Republican and decorated former Naval aviator who spent five and half years as a prisoner of war in North Vietnam, has long argued that more American troops are needed in Iraq to carry out an effective counterinsurgency campaign. He spoke at a time when many Republicans say his support for the war in Iraq has become a drag on his candidacy.If he became the commander in chief, Mr. McCain suggested that he might keep Robert M. Gates as defense secretary. For the post of chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, he would consider Gen. David H. Petraeus, the senior commander in Iraq, Lt. Gen. Raymond T. Odierno, the day-to-day commander in Iraq, and Adm. William J. Fallon, the newly appointed head of the Central Command. They are carrying out the new strategy in Baghdad. Mr. McCain has been critical of their predecessors, Gen. George W. Casey, the former American commander in Iraq, and the former secretary of defense, Donald H. Rumsfeld.Mr. McCain also said he would seek to attract corporate leaders to improve management of the Pentagon, citing figures like Frederick W. Smith, the chief executive of FedEx Corporation, and John T. Chambers, the chief executive of Cisco Systems. “I would go to these people and say ‘Look, you’ve made a billion dollars. Come on now, and do what David Packard did years ago. Serve your country,’ ” Mr. McCain said, referring to the co-founder of the Hewlett Packard Company who served as deputy defense secretary in the first Nixon administration.Mr. McCain also described Gen. James L. Jones, the former NATO commander and Marine general, as one of his closest friends, adding he expected he would “play a key role.”Mr. McCain discussed Iraq during an hourlong session on Thursday at his Senate office, sipping cappuccino and talking in measured if intense tones in the presence of two aides. He ended the interview to go to the White House for a meeting with Mr. Bush.“One of the things that I’m going to tell him, and I don’t often talk about my conversations with the president, is that the American people need to be told more often what’s happening,” he said. “Where we’re succeeding; where we’re failing; where we’ve made progress; where we haven’t, here’s the state of readiness, here’s why we continue to see suicide bombers.”“There’s got to be more communication with the American people,” he added. “Franklin Delano Roosevelt did it.”Mr. McCain said that the increase in American forces had led to a decline of sectarian killings in the Iraqi capital. Despite claims of progress in Iraq, however, Mr. McCain acknowledged that the American strategy would falter unless the Iraqis moved quickly to establish a more inclusive government. He expressed disappointment that the effort to enact a new law that would allow more former Baathists to serve in the government was stalled and said it was vital to arrange provincial elections so that Sunnis could join the political process.“So how do you motivate the Maliki government? Well, one of the ways is go sit down and have dinner with him like Lindsey Graham and I did last week,” he said, alluding to his Republican colleague from South Carolina. He said that he and Mr. Graham had warned Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki that the patience of the American public was running out. Many members of the Bush administration and other lawmakers have met with Mr. Maliki to make the same point.“We’re telling you, there’s been votes in both houses of Congress which portend, unless the American people see measurable success, that we’re going to be out of here,” Mr. McCain said, recalling the message he had delivered to the Iraqi leader. “No matter whether I happen to agree with it or not.”“He gets it. He gets it,” Mr. McCain said of Mr. Maliki. “The question is whether they do it or not.”According to the military’s deployment schedule, only three of the five additional combat brigades that are to be deployed in and around Baghdad under Mr. Bush’s plan have arrived. Mr. McCain said the prospects for the new strategy would be known “within months.”Even more unclear is what Iraq might look like by the time a new president takes office in the United States. The most optimistic scenario he envisioned involved a steady reduction in violence and a gradual turnover of security responsibilities to the Iraqis during the remainder of the Bush administration. Under those circumstances, Mr. McCain said, the United States military would gradually withdraw to its bases in Iraq, though he did not provide a timetable for how long that might take.American air and ground forces could continue to operate from those bases when needed but then eventually leave, he said. He said that he had recently met with Gen. Pervez Musharraf, Pakistan’s president, and had been told that Pakistan would be prepared to help Iraq if the country was secure.On the other hand, the failure of the troop buildup plan and an escalation of violence, Mr. McCain said, would present the United States with a range of flawed fallback options.One plan proposed by some Democratic lawmakers is to withdraw American troops to Kuwait, from where they might carry out strikes against terrorists in Iraq belonging to Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia. Mr. McCain argued that this approach reflected a naïve understanding of the difficulties in obtaining intelligence and conducting operations in Iraq. “The fact of modern warfare is that you can’t parachute into places,” he said. “You can’t go in without a solid base of support if you’re going to be engaged in heavy fighting.”Another plan, advocated by Mrs. Clinton, would maintain a reduced force at bases in Iraq to stabilize Kurdistan, deter neighboring nations from intervening and to fight terrorist groups there. “That assumes somehow that the place has not descended into chaos,” said Mr. McCain, who warned that reducing the force without first stabilizing Iraq would put the American forces in the position of being “rocketed in their bases.”Putting additional emphasis on training the Iraqi Army, Mr. McCain also argued, would not be effective unless security in Iraq was improved. “I’d be very reluctant to send your men into a country where there is chaos and tell them they’re going to be trainers.”Partitioning Iraq into Sunni, Shiite and Kurdish enclaves, as some experts have proposed, was “totally unrealistic,” Mr. McCain argued, because the Iraqis are opposed to measures that would lead to the further dislocation of the population and even divide families.He also suggested that setting deadlines for withdrawing troops — as many lawmakers are seeking to legislate — would backfire, hamstringing commanders and giving opponents a way to wait out the Americans.Mr. McCain acknowledged that his message — that a long, hard and uncertain road still lies ahead in Iraq — was not a popular one, and could mark the end of his political ambitions. And it could be as politically treacherous for Mr. McCain to back away from his support of the war as it is for him to stay with it.During a recent speech at the Virginia Military Institute, Mr. McCain noted that he had recently met Petty Officer First Class Mark Robbins, a Navy Seal who was shot in the eye in an ambush outside Baghdad, in a military hospital in Germany and that he planned personally to award him the Purple Heart.“Oh, God, I’ve seen a lot of things in my life,” Mr. McCain recalled in the interview. “I’ve seen a lot of things. That kid sitting up there. His head. Blood all over the back of him.”“Grabs my hand and says, ‘I’m honored you’re here. Thanks for your support. We can win this fight.’ You know, I’m supposed to worry about my political future?”'"
"'07-04-15,'0','This year, the pace of the killings has worsened; as of Friday the death toll stood at 110, or 16 percent higher than at the same time last year. By comparison, in New York City, with six times the population, there were 102 homicides from Jan. 1 to April 8, a drop of almost 24.4 percent from the same period a year ago. The rise in violence is evident at the University of Pennsylvania hospital, whose trauma unit treated 479 gunshot victims last year, a 15 percent increase over 2005. Some 18 percent of the attacks were fatal, and 16 percent of the victims will suffer permanent disabilities, like paralysis from head or spinal injuries, amputations, or long-term damage to internal organs.Gun violence is becoming so common in some parts of the city that many people are no longer shocked by it, said Dr. Bill Schwab, chief of trauma and surgical critical care at the hospital.“Are people becoming numb to violence? The answer is yes,” Dr. Schwab said. “It’s very common for them to be sitting on their porch and to hear gunshots in the night.”What sets Philadelphia apart from other cities, say the police, politicians and academic experts, is the combination of high poverty — with 25 percent of the population living below the poverty line, the city has the highest rate among the 10 biggest cities, according to census data — a youth culture that increasingly settles minor disputes through violence and the easy availability of guns.Pennsylvania’s cities are forbidden by state law from making their own gun laws, and so must conform to the political will of a largely rural state that, according to the National Rifle Association, has around a quarter of a million gun owners.With about 85 percent of Philadelphia’s homicides involving guns, gun control advocates are urging state lawmakers to limit handgun purchases to one per person per month. The goal is to choke off supply to so-called straw purchasers, who buy multiple guns on behalf of those who cannot legally acquire the guns themselves because they have criminal records.Supporters — including Gov. Edward G. Rendell and Philadelphia’s police chief, Sylvester Johnson — say it would not curtail the right of gun owners to bear arms but would significantly reduce the number of illegal guns on the street.But many state lawmakers oppose the plan, which was introduced in February as part of a package of gun control measures, as an attempt to curb the Second Amendment right to bear arms. “It’s a constitutional infringement,” said State Representative Bryan Cutler, a Republican from Lancaster County, at a recent seminar at Temple University Hospital here on the effects of gun violence.A similar measure was defeated in the Legislature last October, the day after a Lancaster County gunman carrying a mostly legal arsenal shot 10 Amish schoolgirls in their classroom, killing five of them.For Karim Williams, the explanation for Philadelphia’s carnage is a lack of jobs.“You’ve got to have jobs for the people that need them,” he said from his gurney. “You have to keep people occupied. Without jobs, all you can do is resort to violence.”Mr. Williams said he recently became a licensed electrician and was looking for work after a past in which he served jail time for crimes including car theft and drug dealing.While Mr. Williams hopes to escape the violence of his West Philadelphia neighborhood, it is too late for Richard Johnson. He was killed in a South Philadelphia convenience store in July 2005 when he was 17.His mother, Catherine Young, said Richard — who had won a full academic scholarship to a local university — and his cousin were shot by a 16-year-old boy who claimed they were blocking the doorway in the store, and came back a short time later with a gun.“It’s so easy for them to have a gun,” Ms. Young said. “Nobody should own a gun except the police.”'"
"'07-04-15,'0','An April 8 editorial asked, “Who’s Afraid of a Tax Cap?” Me!Gov. M. Jodi Rell would cap municipal spending at 3 percent per year while aid phases in. Some new state aid would go to education, the balance to property owners, unless towns’ tax rolls grow faster than 1.5 percent per year. What’s scary?There’s one way to increase tax rolls: development. Connecticut development rules are designed to drive up taxes by using a lot of expensive land. When towns are compelled to increase tax rolls faster than 1.5 percent per year, I fear they’ll develop fields and forests, not redevelop existing sites.In 2002 developed land had increased 15 percent over 1985 levels. We must relax the pressure to sprawl. We need to shift more costs from towns to the state. But a phase-in will compel towns to aggressively compete for taxes.The organization of which I am president, 1,000 Friends of Connecticut, recommends new grants to towns in 2008.

"'07-04-15,'0','It hasn’t really been known as a place where people live, but a rezoning that took effect in 2004 is poised to change that, because it gave a green light to the construction of larger residential buildings.The area now teeters on the edge of a building boom, which officials and developers predict will transform it into what they deem a “24 hour” neighborhood.“If you walk down a street in the commercial core now at 7:30 at night, it’s very quiet,” said Joseph Chan, the president of the Downtown Brooklyn Partnership, an umbrella group overseeing the area’s renewal.“That lack of activity does not convey the sense of a vibrant downtown, and that’s going to change extraordinarily quickly with the development here.”By Mr. Chan’s estimate, more than 7,000 residential units are in planning stages or under construction in downtown Brooklyn, not including the nearby Atlantic Yards proposal — which calls for eight million square feet of high-rise housing, office space and a basketball arena on 22 acres.He noted that his organization was working with the Real Estate Board of New York and local property owners to fill in the neighborhood’s retail gaps.Hal Henenson, the executive director of the development marketing group at Prudential Douglas Elliman, agreed that downtown Brooklyn is on the verge of change, attractive for its transportation options, relative affordability and proximity to borough shopping strips.“For people who are looking for the next new neighborhood, if you will,” he said, “I think in Brooklyn, it’s downtown.”The neighborhood stretches from the rumble of the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway south to Schermerhorn Street, and from the busy shops along Court Street and Cadman Plaza West toward Flatbush Avenue to the east, where cars head toward the Manhattan Bridge.At the area’s heart is Borough Hall, a stately Greek Revival structure facing a handsomely landscaped plaza where a farmer’s market is available two days a week year round. Farther north, Cadman Plaza Park offers a 10-acre swath of green space popular with dog walkers and office workers.The neighborhood’s civic and commercial character remains prominent, with a heavy concentration of courts and other municipal facilities as well as the boxy MetroTech center, its modern buildings arranged around a manicured commons. Abutting MetroTech is the Fulton Street Mall area, a rollicking destination for electronics, jewelry, hip-hop music and urban street wear.Housing at this point is limited to scattered rentals and a handful of co-ops and condominiums. An exception is Concord Village, a co-op development of more than 1,000 apartments on the edge of downtown beside the Brooklyn Bridge.But one need only follow the trail of cranes and cement trucks to see what’s in store for the area, much of it within what Mr. Chan identifies as three nodes of development.The first is a pocket east of the Flatbush Avenue Extension that was included in the 2004 rezoning, where several major high-rises are planned. The Oro, a glassy 40-story condominium with 303 apartments, a 50-foot swimming pool and an indoor basketball court, is already well under way there.Next are the Schermerhorn and Livingston Street corridors. The former Board of Education headquarters at 110 Livingston is being transformed into a 299-unit condo by David Walentas, who originally envisioned the neighborhood now known as Dumbo. There is also the 158-unit State Renaissance Court on Schermerhorn Street, a mixed-income project financed by the city’s Housing Development Corporation. Both are set to open this spring.Finally, there is a cluster of buildings being planned around the commercial core, including the BellTel Lofts, in the former Verizon Building on Willoughby Street. The residential future of the Fulton Street Mall itself was confirmed in February with the announcement that its three-story Albee Square Mall will be demolished and rebuilt, topped with 1,000 apartments.Although downtown Brooklyn is in its infant stages as a residential neighborhood, prices can generally be discerned from apartments sold but not yet occupied.At 110 Livingston, the Walentas condo, 262 units have sold since last summer — from studios starting in the high $300,000s to three-bedrooms starting above $900,000. Earlier this month, a three-bedroom penthouse with an 800-square-foot terrace sold for $1.35 million. Common charges average $500 a month.“We found that the more expensive product was what was selling quickly,” said Asher Abehsera, vice president for residential sales at the Two Trees Management Company, the building’s developer, noting that the larger three-bedrooms were almost gone. “It shows that downtown Brooklyn can handle and would like to see more high-end large condominium homes.”Mr. Henenson of Prudential Douglas Elliman said that the commercial core, where BellTel Lofts are, offered Manhattan-style luxury at a lower cost. As he put it, “You could buy a loft in Chelsea, and the same loft in downtown Brooklyn would be literally half the price.”Last month, Mr. Henenson noted, two apartments were bought together in BellTel for $2.5 million, to be combined into five bedrooms with four and a half bathrooms, with nearly 3,000 square feet of space.How long prices will remain at this level, however, is a question. “We’re in the echelon of $1,000 a square foot,” said Jerry Minsky, a senior vice president at the Corcoran Group in nearby Fort Greene. “There’s enough evidence to prove that it’s not turning back.”What to DoLike gems in a necklace, some of the borough’s best-known amenities ring downtown. Just beyond its perimeter in Fort Greene is the Brooklyn Academy of Music; nearby, a theater and an arts library are to join what is being called the BAM Cultural District.A stroll south along Smith Street in Carroll Gardens reveals dozens of restaurants, including the Grocery and Saul, as well as bars that brim with life on summer evenings. To the west is Brooklyn Heights, with its promenade.Closer in, a Y.M.C.A. opened in 2005 below the Court House Apartments on Atlantic Avenue, offering a six-lane pool and children’s classes. Court Street is a main commercial artery, with a Barnes & Noble store and a 12-screen movie theater.Near the East River waterfront where Dutch farmers formed the village of Breuckelen in the 17th century, the downtown area grew as the civic heart of independent Brooklyn.The grand City Hall was completed in 1849 and became known as Borough Hall in 1898, when Brooklyn became part of New York. Schools and churches sprouted, as well as office towers, hotels and theaters. Retailing floundered in the postwar period, although downtown Brooklyn began a new phase in the 1990s with the development of MetroTech.There are no public elementary schools in downtown Brooklyn, but schools in adjacent neighborhoods have received good marks.One is Public School 8 on Hicks Street in Brooklyn Heights, which has benefited in recent years from new administration and increased parent involvement, 62 percent of students met city and state standards in English in the 2004-2005 school year, versus 61 percent citywide. Sixty-nine percent achieved the math requirements, versus 65 percent citywide.As for private schools, downtown Brooklyn boasts a well-regarded kindergarten-through-Grade 12 institution: Brooklyn Friends, which opened in 1867 in the Quaker Meeting House on Schermerhorn Street.There are stations on the 2, 3, 4, 5, A, C, F, M, R, B, G and Q subway lines. Some stop twice within the area, and many are one or two stops from Manhattan. Ms. Richmond, the designer, said she and her husband both had door-to-door commutes of under half an hour to the SoHo area.In addition, the Brooklyn and Manhattan bridges are nearby, as well as the Flatbush Avenue terminal of the Long Island Rail Road.With thousands of new residents en route, business-centered downtown Brooklyn can swiftly morph into a livable neighborhood.'"

"'07-04-16,'1','Mr. Cunningham, who has owned the restaurant since the mid-’80s, said he had never seen prices so high and lobsters so scarce.Although spring is traditionally a slow season for lobstermen and the time when prices are the highest, this season is shaping up to be one of the worst in a generation.“What we have now is it’s windy, snowing sideways, record-high prices, and there’s no lobster to speak of in the inventory,” said Pete McAleney, owner of New Meadows Lobster, a dealer in Portland, Me. “Everything that can go wrong is going wrong.”A pattern of strong northwest winds has made it difficult for lobstermen to head out to sea for the last two months or so, said Robert C. Bayer, executive director of the University of Maine Lobster Institute.When lobstermen do head out, they find their traps filled with more bait than lobsters. Unseasonably cold spring weather has lowered water temperatures about six degrees, too cold for lobsters to want to feed, Dr. Bayer said.Dealers, many of whom are in Canada, keep thousands of pounds of reserve lobsters in tidal pounds or protected coves each fall, when the price is low. The lobsters are sold starting in late December, as cold sets in and prices increase.Because of surpluses in recent years, fewer lobsters were put in tidal pounds, Dr. Bayer said, and the reserves have all but run out. Some fishermen say they believe that the Canadian companies are selling lobsters to Europe and Asia, where prices are even higher.“This year, we didn’t put as much away as we thought we should,” Mr. McAleney said. His company has 1,000 pounds of lobster in stock, compared with 35,000 pounds or so in the summer.Lobstermen say they are barely making money, despite the high prices.“I’m not catching nothing, but it’s pretty close,” said Jack Merrill, a lobsterman from Mount Desert, Me. “This morning when I went out, there was still ice in the harbor. In the middle of April, that’s almost unheard of. That’s really cold, and it’s why the lobsters aren’t moving and the price is so high.”Mr. Castelli said his customers here refused to pay top dollar, because they were used to “going down to the docks and getting them for $5.”Despite the price, restaurants say they continue to sell lobster, mostly to tourists intent on having a taste of New England. Mr. Thissell said the Union Oyster House expected to sell what lobster it had this weekend to visitors in town for the Boston Marathon on Monday and hoped that the supply would not run out.“People want lobster, and they’ll still pay for it,” Mr. Thissell said. “People are already spending $1,000 on hotels. They’ve come to Boston. So they think, ‘Why not have the lobster?’ ”'"
"'07-04-16,'1','KABUL, Afghanistan, April 15 — Afghanistan’s foreign minister, Rangeen Dadfar Spanta, on Sunday ruled out any further deals with kidnappers after a videotape was broadcast showing two French aid workers whom the Taliban claimed to be holding hostage.Also on Sunday, a suicide bomber on a motorbike killed four Afghan guards from an American security company near Kandahar in southern Afghanistan, and fighting was reported on the border with Pakistan in Paktika Province and farther south in Helmand Province.“We will avoid the exchange of hostages with the criminals,” Mr. Spanta told reporters. “If we do it once or twice, it will become a procedure. It won’t have an end.”“The policy of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan is that criminals should not be rewarded, they should be punished, and the Taliban are a criminal group,” he said.He spoke after kidnappers released a videotape, which was shown on Al Arabiya television, of a French man and woman pleading for the French government to meet the kidnappers’ demands or they would be killed. It is not clear what those demands are.President Hamid Karzai has been criticized for giving in to Taliban demands to win the release of an Italian journalist last month but failing to save the Afghan interpreter who worked with him. Since then, the two French aid workers have been abducted, with three Afghan colleagues, in southwestern Afghanistan.President Jacques Chirac of France appealed to Mr. Karzai for help in gaining their release in a telephone call on Saturday.'"
"'07-04-16,'1','Israeli officials had stated before the meeting that core “final status” issues of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, like borders, the future of Jerusalem and the fate of millions of Palestinian refugees, would not be on the agenda. Ms. Eisin specified that no final status issues had been addressed in the first hour, and gave no details about the second hour.But Mr. Erekat said in a telephone interview that the second hour was the “most significant,” and focused on “the political horizon — how to probe the possibility of implementing President Bush’s vision for a two-state solution, and how to get there.” It was the first time since January 2001, he said, that an Israeli prime minister and a Palestinian president had addressed fundamental issues.The two sides have agreed to meet in two weeks in the West Bank city of Jericho.Earlier on Sunday, Mr. Olmert told the Israeli cabinet that Israel would make “every effort to find a comprehensive solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.” Israeli officials have also indicated that Israel would be willing to discuss an Arab peace initiative with a working committee of the Arab League, if invited.“Israel has never blacklisted the Arab League — it was the other way around,” said Mark Regev, a spokesman for the Israeli Foreign Ministry.Israel rejected the Arab peace initiative when it was first raised in 2002. Based on a Saudi proposal, it calls for a full Israeli withdrawal to its pre-1967 boundaries in return for full relations with the Arab world. Mr. Olmert has said there are positive elements in the initiative and others that Israel finds unacceptable. In particular, Israel objects to a clause about the refugees, which it interprets as demanding the right of return for the refugees of 1948 and their descendants to their original homes in what is now Israel.Despite the positive signals, Israeli commentators remained skeptical about the potential for real, imminent progress. Mr. Olmert and Mr. Abbas are both in weak positions at home. Mr. Olmert is also said to be nervously awaiting the interim conclusions of a committee headed by a retired judge, Eliyahu Winograd, on the government’s performance during last summer’s war in Lebanon. The report is due at the end of April.“Nothing significant will happen before Winograd, and I think the Palestinians understand that,” said Shlomo Brom, a retired general and senior researcher at the Institute for National Security Studies in Tel Aviv. But he noted a “positive change” in Israel’s approach to the Arab initiative and said that if Mr. Olmert “survives Winograd,” everything could change.Also on Sunday, the Vatican’s ambassador to Israel, Archbishop Antonio France, attended the Remembrance Day ceremony at the Holocaust Museum, reversing his earlier decision to skip the event in protest over the museum’s depiction of Pope Pius XII as not doing enough to help stop the killings of Jews during World War II. The archbishop’s office did not respond to a telephone call seeking comment.'"
"'07-04-16,'1','Sheelah Kolhatkar writes about the handful of women who actually do private equity deals. Gabriel Sherman interviews Bruce Sherman, the reclusive Florida money manager who has invested heavily in newspapers.“Business is about power,” Ms. Lipman writes in her first editor’s letter. “And guts. And passion. Business coverage should be too.”Business is also about brains, and Condé Nast’s were certainly questioned when the company announced in September 2005 that it was putting out a business magazine — its biggest single investment in a start-up — at a time when many others were foundering.Readers were still reeling from the bursting of the Internet bubble and corporate scandals, and investors were looking at constantly updated Web sites — not biweekly glossies — for an edge. And some sizable advertisers, like the Detroit automakers, were mired in slumps of their own.Some of the big magazines remain troubled: ad pages for the first three months of this year were down for BusinessWeek (3 percent), Forbes (9 percent) and Fortune (13 percent), compared with the same period a year ago, according to Publishers Information Bureau. Circulation at the big three has been flat or falling for the last few years, according to the Audit Bureau of Circulations.But Portfolio would not be the first business magazine introduced during trying times. Henry Luce founded Fortune just months after the Wall Street crash of 1929, for example.S. I. Newhouse, chairman of Condé Nast, said in an interview that he had no patience with Portfolio skeptics.“Damn the torpedoes and full speed ahead,” he said. “I don’t think we’re going to trample on Forbes or Fortune. I think we’re going to help the whole field. We’re going to bring excitement to it, and we’re going to bring luxury and fashion advertisers into it.”Mr. Newhouse said that Portfolio had been inspired by a positive response to business articles in Vanity Fair and The New Yorker, although he could not recall precisely which ones. He also said he had not made the final decision to proceed until Ms. Lipman agreed in August 2005 to leave The Wall Street Journal, where she had overseen its Weekend Journal and Personal Journal sections and its Saturday paper.Mr. Newhouse said that his reported commitment to the magazine of more than $100 million over the next five years was “something of a myth” because “we’re going to stay with Portfolio.”Portfolio has hired more than 75 editorial people for the magazine, 40 for its Web site, www.portfolio.com, and more than 45 on the business side.The business side, under Mr. Carey, the former publisher of The New Yorker, has been working Madison Avenue hard. After all, he has a reputation to uphold. During his tenure at The New Yorker, between 1998 and 2005, advertising revenue almost doubled and the magazine broke the 1 million mark in circulation. In 1996, Mr. Carey brought 210 ad pages to the first issue of the restarted House and Garden, one of the highest levels ever for a new magazine.Portfolio’s first issue has drawn 53 business advertisers, 30 of which had rarely if ever advertised in a Condé Nast publication. The newcomers include Barclays and Pitney Bowes.“Job No. 1 was to deepen the company’s penetration in the business advertising category, which the May issue achieved,” Mr. Carey said. Bringing more business advertisers in the door could get them interested in advertising in some of the company’s other magazines; at the same time, Portfolio provides a new outlet, and another affluent readership, for advertisers who already appear in those other magazines.Portfolio was nearly two years in the making, a long time for journalists to go without ink. At least one who was hired has already left, sowing rumors of sagging morale. During the start-up period, competing publications have written articles that were rumored to be appearing in Portfolio, trying to steal its thunder, and articles at Portfolio were commissioned and killed.Mr. Wolfe added some drama of his own, sweeping through Portfolio’s hushed glassy offices with a black cape over his white suit. His narrative was supposed to run 2,500 words but he submitted 11,000, since honed to 7,500 words. His is the longest piece in the magazine.One of Portfolio’s most celebrated hires, Kurt Eichenwald, a former reporter for The New York Times, was to have been featured in the premiere issue. But his article, on terrorism, was held, according to people involved with the magazine, because Mr. Eichenwald deluged the magazine’s fact-checking department with thousands of pages of documents just before the article was to go to press last month. It is expected to appear in a later issue.Holding it, these people said, was unrelated to a controversy involving Mr. Eichenwald that emerged earlier in March: the revelation that in 2005, while at The Times, he had sent $2,000 to someone who later became the subject of an article. (Mr. Eichenwald, who has said the money was repaid long before the article appeared, declined to comment for this article.)Ms. Lipman declined to discuss the article but called Mr. Eichenwald “one of the finest investigative reporters there is.”James Impoco, deputy editor at the magazine and a former Sunday Business editor at The New York Times, said that Ms. Lipman had “exacting standards.”He said that “she knows what she wants and is pretty strong-willed.”Mr. Impoco added: “I have to admit that I was a little worried after she saw ‘The Devil Wears Prada’ and told me she sympathized with the Meryl Streep character. But she turned out to be a pretty thoughtful boss.”Ms. Lipman was almost giddy last week as she showed off a display of the magazine’s pages on the walls of a secured room. Portfolio’s goal, she said, was to “connect the dots” between life inside the boardroom and out.“I love this kind of story,” she said, gesturing to a profile of Boone Pickens, the Texas oil tycoon whose son pleaded guilty last year to securities fraud. “It’s a great ‘King Lear’ tale,” she said. “He’s in his second act and his family’s disintegrating.”The magazine is priced at $4.99 on the newsstand and is testing subscription prices from $12 to $22 for 12 issues. Its next issue is scheduled for late August, and it will appear monthly after that.The magazine’s Web site, which will be free, will contain all the articles in the magazine and report breaking news, much of it by Portfolio writers. Chris Jones, the site’s managing editor, said its bloggers would post three and five times a day. The site has elaborately produced videos and various interactive features.In conjunction with Condé Nast Traveler, the Web site will also tell readers things like the best place to make a deal in various cities, and which company’s employees like to stay in which hotels (in San Francisco, Yahoo likes the Clift, Mr. Jones said). For those readers headed to jail, portfolio.com offers prison advice: get dental work done in advance and don’t talk to the press.Still, the magazine is at the heart of the Portfolio enterprise and while some skeptics remain, they acknowledge that Portfolio is well positioned.“I don’t think they would make the same decision to launch a business magazine now because the climate has changed since they announced,” said Martin Walker, a magazine consultant.But, he added, “you’re talking about a powerhouse publishing company, and they have a terrific database to get subscribers, they have all kinds of ad connections and they are spending enormous amounts of money.”And there are signs of life elsewhere in business magazines. Fortune is putting out a redesign of its venerable Fortune 500 issue today with heavier paper stock (not as heavy as Portfolio’s) and may redesign the whole magazine. Forbes is planning a new business magazine, geared toward women. Portfolio has been raiding business publications for writers and editors, setting off an intense competition for marquee names.Robert Safian, former executive editor of Fortune and now editor and managing director of Fast Company (circulation 755,000), said the entire business category was undergoing a reinvention.“Business remains at the heart of our culture, nationally and globally,” he said. “The traditional business magazines have had trouble capturing and expressing that excitement in recent years, and the ad market has reflected that, but I think the tide is turning.”'"
"'07-04-16,'1','The Boris Eifman Ballet of St. Petersburg swept into City Center on Friday night for a three-week season that is a 30th-anniversary retrospective and has an American premiere, “The Seagull,” tucked in for good measure. The opening program was, for the most part, an eye-filling canter through three decades of repertory, seen in excerpts. Mr. Eifman’s “Red Giselle” was performed in full the following night.The two evenings suggested much about Mr. Eifman’s vivid, problematic works. The first program offered an ideal way to get a feeling for his style and ballets, a primer of sorts, though clearly none was needed for the happy, avid Russian émigrés who seem to make up most of the Eifman audiences in New York. The less said the better about the opening work, “Cassandra,” a world premiere by Nikita Dmitrievsky and set to music by Holst that dragged on through a confusing retelling of the story of the doomed seer of Greek mythology.According to his program biography, Mr. Dmitrievsky, the Eifman company’s first guest choreographer, trained in ballet, modern dance, jazz dance, acrobatics, hip-hop and breakdance. A few head spins might have helped “Cassandra,” though the brief male costumes were fun at first. Mr. Dmitrievsky may have achieved a record early in his career by creating 40 ballets in 10 months. But “Cassandra” looks like the effort of a new artist cramming everything he knows into a first ballet, including a good bit of Martha Graham. Graham did it better.It was a great relief to swing into undiluted Eifman, in extended snippets from six ballets (“Who’s Who,” “The Karamazovs,” “Anna Karenina, “Don Quixote,” “Don Juan & Molière” and his 1977 “DoubleVoice,” an American premiere, all set to big, familiar music). His theatrical imagination was in full play here, evident both in his reworking of traditional narratives and in stunning scenic and glittering costume effects that also suggest an unlimited production budget. Two scenes from “The Karamazovs” say it all.In one, shifting proletarian masses surge about the stage with the slightly robotic quality seen in much of Eifman’s group choreography and with the sharp-angled bodies frequently seen in his pas de deux. In the second scene lovers meet on either side of a grill of prison bars that eventually sweeps away exhilaratingly to free the two for an ardent romantic encounter.Mr. Eifman’s re-envisioning of Don Quixote as a madman in an asylum is bold. And Yuri Smekalov, one of several outstanding male performers in the company, portrayed the Don with wonderfully cheeky humor and poignant shading. Here indeed was a madman for all seasons. A scene from “Don Juan” closed the program, doubling as an ingenious but slightly creepy coda in which the dancers might have been consuming the choreography of Mr. Eifman, who sat at the head of the table where they ate.'"
"'07-04-16,'1','In “A Man Among Wolves,” a bizarre and riveting nature documentary that will be shown tonight on the National Geographic Channel, a British former gamekeeper named Shaun Ellis feeds wolf cubs prechewed food from his own mouth. He licks them on their chops. They lick him on the lips. He howls, eats and frolics with them.The only thing Mr. Ellis does not do is to instruct the cubs in mating behavior. Perhaps that is because this is an all-male wolf pack. Perhaps it is because fanaticism has its limits. Whatever the reason, this omission is one of the best things about “Wolves.”Mr. Ellis says his calling is “not for the fainthearted.” He might well say the same thing about this program, which features many close-ups of wolves and their alpha-man chomping raw deer. Because he is the leader of the pack, Mr. Ellis eats the liver, lungs and heart, which are cooked briefly to make them fit for human consumption, then stuffed back into the deer’s abdominal cavity.Mr. Ellis has lived the lupine life for almost two years, at a wildlife park in southern England. His three cubs were abandoned at birth. Mr. Ellis, whose partner and four children have abandoned him because of this project, adopted the cubs. There are scenes of him feeding the baby wolves milk and, most adorably, teaching them to howl.Howling is serious business for wolves, who use it to communicate and guard territory. The sight of Mr. Ellis yodeling along with his snub-nose charges is so cute it will make you want your own wolf pack. But beware: Having a baby wolf is like having a baby. One minute they’re defenseless cuddleballs sucking a bottle, and the next they’re ripping up your face with their love bites. (When this happens, Mr. Ellis says wolf saliva heals his cuts faster than conventional medicine.)Eventually the child becomes father to the man. Late in “Wolves” Mr. Ellis is called away from his furry family. The emergency: Polish farmers plagued by wolves need his help. Mr. Ellis goes to Poland and sets up a tape of wolf howls to drive away the predators. This is probably interesting to scientists, but to viewers it’s a letdown. Who cares about Polish cattle, when there’s a wolf-man to gawk at?By the time Mr. Ellis returns to his cubs, they’ve outstripped him in every way. “Wolves” ends with our hero in a subservient, stomach-up posture so the new alpha-male won’t hurt him. It’s a bittersweet moment that will strike a nerve in anyone who has ever had the bad judgment to give birth to children.'"
"'07-04-16,'1','SAN FRANCISCO, April 15 — Intel is planning to announce a number of technology advances this week at a conference in Beijing, including an initiative that could give rise to a new class of wireless hand-held computers, according to several people close to the efforts.The conference, the Intel Developer Forum, is held three times a year, and its convening in China underscores the growing significance of the Chinese market in the computer industry. Last month, Intel announced that it would build its first chip-making factory in China.The effort on hand-held computers is aimed at creating what Intel is calling mobile Internet devices, larger than current palmtops and smaller than notebooks. They are seen as the next generation of the Ultra Mobile PC, introduced last year by Microsoft.Although that class of computer has so far been commercially disappointing, both companies maintain that the growing reliance on mobile broadband access to the Internet will eventually create a large consumer market for data-oriented devices.The Intel-designed hand-helds will be based on a new low-power version of the company’s X86 microprocessor designs code-named McCaslin, intended to increase the battery life of the ultra-mobile computer class. The new chips will come with wireless standards including Wi-Fi, WiMax and Bluetooth as well as satellite navigation and television tuner capabilities. The processor will consume an average of one-half watt of power, less than half of that used by current Intel chips.'"
"'07-04-16,'1','For taxpayers with incomes above $100,000 the odds of being audited in 2006 were 1 in 59; above $1 million, the odds increased to 1 in 16. People in lower income brackets — those reporting incomes below $25,000 — faced a 1 in 94 chance of being audited.The increased focus on the middle class is part of a broad I.R.S. strategy to deal with a major reduction in the ranks of the tax police as the population continues to grow and Congress has made the tax system ever more complex.The I.R.S. has fewer than 13,000 revenue agents, down from more than 17,000 at the peak in 1988.The core of the new strategy is to audit more individuals and businesses, even if the examinations are more cursory. Without more audits, I.R.S. executive say, people may behave as if no one is watching.The I.R.S. more than doubled the number of individual tax returns audited from 2000 to 2006, increasing from nearly 618,000 audits to nearly 1.3 million.Chris Edwards, director of tax policy at the Cato Institute, a libertarian research and advocacy group in Washington, said that Congress is driving the need for more audits. Since 1995, he said, “the Republicans greatly complexified the tax code, contributing to tax evasion and making the I.R.S.’s job more difficult.”Deputy Commissioner Brown and others said the strategy of pursuing more audits, even if each one receives less time and attention, has proved a success. Tax revenue from enforcement actions, he said, rose from $33.8 billion in 2000 to $48.7 billion in 2006.Critics have said the increased revenue from enforcement actions shows only how widespread tax evasion has become and how easy it is to find tax cheating. The I.R.S.’s most recent estimate is that $290 billion in taxes due were not reported and paid. But studies have suggested the figure is higher, mostly from hidden investment gains, multinational businesses and entrepreneurs.Individual audits increased up and down the income ladder. For those making under $25,000, audits rose from 369,000 to 589,000, with most of the attention focused on the working poor who applied the earned income tax credit, a form of negative income tax aimed at encouraging people with families to work rather than seek government benefits.Audits of these taxpayers peaked in 2005, and the I.R.S. said it expected audits of applicants for the credit to decline somewhat in the years ahead because it has refined techniques to identify those who cheat and the tax preparers who encourage cheating.About 15 percent of audits of low-income taxpayers find nothing amiss, Deputy Commissioner Brown said.Audits of those making more than $100,000, the 11 percent or so of Americans who pay about 80 percent of individual income taxes, rose to more than 256,000 from just fewer than 100,000, a jump of 163 percent. The odds went from 1 in 104 to 1 in 59.At the very top, those making more than $1 million a year, the data showed that from 2004 to 2006 the number of audits rose 77 percent, from almost 9,600 to 17,000. But more than half of those audits were only letters asking for documentation.The middle class was lightly audited in recent years because it relies mostly on wage income, which is reported by employers and from which taxes are withheld. The I.R.S. has told Congress that it captures 99 percent of wage income, but only about 70 percent of income in which there is little or no independent verification of the figures that people report on their tax returns.Middle-class Americans most likely to have their tax returns examined under the new strategy are those who own a business, even a side business, or are landlords or have investment income. There is little or no independent reporting of such income; the I.R.S. has proposed increased verification and some withholding of payments to independent contractors to reduce cheating, but Congress has not moved on any of those suggestions.Middle-class taxpayers who file a Schedule C — freelancers, consultants and very small businesses — are three times as likely to be audited as those in the same income group with no such business income.The I.R.S. is also increasing scrutiny of people whose returns show they have bought into any of the growing number of schemes sold by people who teach, falsely, that wages are not subject to tax. Some customers of these schemes have received prison terms of more than 10 years, and the Justice Department is pursuing civil and criminal cases against scores of tax fraud promoters.Blended families are also more likely to be audited. The I.R.S. said that it is finding that families created after a divorce, or the death of a spouse, often have children who are claimed on more than one tax return.The I.R.S. reduced audits in only one category — farms, especially those with income of more than $100,000. Audits of these larger farms fell by 28 percent from 2,150 audits in 2000 to 1,547 audits last year. The I.RS. said it cut back because a growing number found no additional taxes were due.One problem with the new strategy of more, but less thorough, audits is that a growing amount of time is spent on audits that do not uncover any additional taxes due.Time spent auditing corporations of all sizes was virtually unchanged from 2001 to 2006, according to a recent analysis by Syracuse University’s Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse. But time spent on corporate audits that were unproductive because no added taxes were recommended grew 40 percent.The I.R.S. acknowledged the accuracy of the numbers, which were obtained under court order. The agency said the change was minor, with about 91 percent of hours devoted to corporate audits recommending more taxes in 2001, compared with about 88 percent in 2006.'"
"'07-04-16,'1','“A good investment,” he said, “is seen as an event that moves the company towards its objective instead of a frivolous social activity.” About a quarter of all the conferences Carlson plans include a nontraditional event, he said, “and the trend is growing.”Since the Sept. 11 attacks, some companies have blended philanthropy with conference activities. “If one of the goals is to promote camaraderie and team building, then bike building or working with Habitat for Humanity does all that and also gives back to the community,” Mr. Paben said.The ideal is an event that swings both ways.For example, when Best Buy was introducing new digital video cameras, it held a training meeting, and invited families who had relatives overseas in the military to dinner at a hotel, Mr. Paben said.After dinner, people from the company showed the family members how to use the cameras. The businesspeople honed their demonstration skills, and the families created videos that were sent to their relatives stationed overseas.Sometimes business isn’t on the agenda at all. “Most conference organizers we deal with want something that entertains,” said Nicholas Tommarello, president of Urban Interactive, a Boston company that organizes scavenger hunts with puzzles that lead to local landmarks.To play, a group of three to five players is given a mystery to solve and a cellphone to provide clues and guidance. As the players move through the city, actors appear with more clues. The group typically visits 10 sites to solve the riddle. In one game, players hunt down a John Singleton Copley portrait that has supposedly been stolen. The quest leads the players through Copley Plaza, the Prudential building and the Boston Public Library.Participants are kept on their toes by a blurring of fiction and reality. The actors in the game are not in obvious costume, so players often don’t know if the vagrant offering advice is part of the drill or “just some guy on the street,” Mr. Tommarello said. Meanwhile, a facilitator evaluates leadership, team building, creativity and performance after the game.“If the activity is planned correctly, it’s usually well received,” Mr. Paben said of conference events. Planners keep in mind participants’ ages and sex, but most of all, they watch the clock. “Beyond two hours,” Mr. Tommarello said, “it’s not much fun.”'"
"'07-04-16,'1','Google tracks the interests and preferences among the millions of people who use its search engine. DoubleClick is the leader among companies that specialize in placing, or “serving,” the graphical and video ads that appear on Web sites. Ad-serving networks like DoubleClick place tiny programs on computers, called cookies, that monitor what sites users visit.Microsoft was joined yesterday by AT&T, a company that traces its lineage to the telephone monopoly broken up in the mid-1980s. “We think antitrust authorities should take a hard look at this deal and the implications,” said Jim Cicconi, senior executive vice president for external affairs at AT&T. “If any one company gets a hammerlock on the online advertising space, as Google seems to be trying to do, that is worrisome.”Microsoft was one of the companies, along with Yahoo and Time Warner, that lost out to Google in the bidding for DoubleClick. Mr. Cicconi said that AT&T would be affected by a Google-DoubleClick combination because AT&T distributes services over the Internet like digital television, known as IPTV.“For many of these new Web services, it could be that the advertising-supported model is the predominant business model,” he said. “The danger here is that Google could be in a position to pick winners and losers.”A Time Warner spokesman said that the company had not decided whether it would try to block the deal. A Yahoo spokeswoman declined to comment.This is not the first time that Microsoft, the biggest winner of the personal computer era, and Google, the emerging Internet powerhouse, have been on opposite sides of an anticompetitive claim. Early last year, Google complained to regulators that the design of Microsoft’s Internet Explorer browser steered users to Microsoft’s MSN search engine instead of rival search offerings from Google and Yahoo.After reviewing the matter, the Justice Department said in May that Microsoft’s browser allowed users a fairly easy way to switch to non-Microsoft search services. Therefore, Microsoft’s product design did not pose an anticompetitive threat, antitrust officials said.In that case, Google did talk to antitrust officials in Europe and the United States. Mr. Smith said Microsoft had not yet approached antitrust officials in the United States about its worries about Google’s purchase of DoubleClick.Mr. Smith said that based on conversations with other companies over the weekend, he expected that many would soon come forward to express similar concerns.The initial antitrust review of a merger lasts 30 days. It is not yet clear whether the Justice Department or the Federal Trade Commission, which share antitrust regulatory duties, will review the Google-DoubleClick deal.Any review of a merger on antitrust grounds begins with a determination of the “relevant market” in which the two companies operate. “That is the first hurdle in case like this,” said Andrew I. Gavil, a law professor at Howard University, “and it looks as if DoubleClick may well be in a nearby, or complementary, market instead of the same market as Google. And then the question will be how easy it is for new entrants to compete in the online advertising markets.”Microsoft contends that the combined companies will have a stranglehold on the market for distributing ads to Web publishers.Mr. Schmidt, however, said that Google and DoubleClick are “small components of a much larger advertising market,” and face considerable competition. He added that it is easy to switch to offerings from rivals of Google and DoubleClick.“We understand that we will go through a regulatory process in the United States and Europe now,” Mr. Schmidt said. “Along the way, all these questions will be discussed and debated. And we welcome that.”'"

Energy prices surged by 5.9 percent last month, the largest one-month increase since September 2005, when Hurricane Katrina shut down Gulf Coast refineries.However, outside of energy, many prices moderated last month; food costs slowed after two months of big gains that had reflected crop damage in winter growing areas.Core inflation, which excludes volatile energy and food, posted a tiny 0.1 percent rise last month, the smallest increase in three months.

"'07-04-17,'1','BLACKSBURG, Va., April 16 — The gunshots were so slow and steady that some students thought they came from a nearby construction site, until they saw the police officers with rifles pointed at Norris Hall, the engineering building at Virginia Tech.They went on and on, for what seemed like 10 or 15 or 20 minutes, an eternity with punctuation.Bang. Bang. On the third floor of Norris Hall, Scott L. Hendricks, a professor, looked out the window of his office and saw students crawling away from the building.Bang. Tiffany Otey’s accounting class crammed into an office and locked themselves in, crying in fright.Every so often, the shots paused for a minute or so. That was the gunman, who was in the midst of the worst shooting rampage in American history, stopping to reload. When it was over, 33 people, including the gunman, were dead and at least 15 more were injured.“I was terrified,” said Ms. Otey, a junior whose class met in the room above the one where much of the shooting took place.One student finished the day’s assignment and tried to leave, but returned to tell the others that the hall was full of smoke and that there were police officers everywhere. The class decided to go into a room with a lock. Dr. Hendricks, an engineering and mechanics professor on the same floor, barricaded himself in his office, pushing a bookcase in front of the door. Some students on campus took refuge in the library, searching the Web to find out what was happening. No one knew.“I was crying,” Ms. Otey said. “I was worried that the guy with the gun was going to come upstairs too.”The violence began early in the morning in the west wing of Ambler Johnston, the largest dormitory at Virginia Tech, where two people were killed, officials said. But when the first class started two hours later, at 9:05 a.m., many on campus remained unaware of any danger.“I woke up and I didn’t know anything was wrong,” said Sarah Ulmer, a freshman who lives in the east wing of the dorm. “I went to my first class and my teacher was talking about how some people weren’t coming because there was a gun threat at West A. J. and they were blocking it off. It was like, ‘Oh.’ ”The school did not notify students by e-mail of the first shootings until 9:26 a.m., said Matt Dixon, who lives in the dorm. Mr. Dixon did not receive the e-mail message until he returned from his 9:05 class. When he left for that class, he said, a resident adviser told him not to use the central stairs, so he left another way.On dry erase boards, advisers had written, “Stay in your rooms,” Mr. Dixon said.Other students and faculty members said they had only a vague notion that there had been a shooting at the dorm. Several faculty members said they had reached campus during or just after the Norris Hall shooting and had gone unimpeded to their buildings.Many were bewildered or angry that the campus had not been locked down earlier, after the first shooting.“I am outraged at what happened today on the Virginia Tech campus,” wrote Huy That Ton, a member of the chemical engineering faculty, in an e-mail message. “Countless lives could have been saved if they had informed the student body of the first shooting. What was the security department thinking?!”Campus officials said they believed the first incident was confined to a single building and was essentially a domestic dispute, and had no idea that the violence would spread elsewhere.The police said they still did not know if the two shootings were the work of the same gunman.The gunman in Norris Hall was described as a young Asian man with two pistols who calmly entered classrooms and shot professors and students. He peeked into the German class in Room 207, witnesses said, then pushed his way in.Gene Cole, who works in Virginia Tech’s housekeeping services, told The Roanoke Times that he was on the second floor of Norris Hall on Monday morning and saw a person lying on a hallway floor. As Mr. Cole went up to the body, a man wearing a hat and holding a gun stepped into the hallway. “Someone stepped out of a classroom and started shooting at me,” he said. Mr. Cole fled down the corridor, then down a flight of steps to safety. “All I saw was blood in the hallways,” Mr. Cole said.The gunman was described as methodical, squeezing the trigger almost rhythmically. “Sometimes there would be like a minute or so break in between them,” Ms. Otey said of the shots, “but for the most part it was one right after another.”Elaine Goss of Waynesboro, Va., said she first spoke to her son, Alec Calhoun, a student, about 9:30 a.m., after he had leapt from a second-story classroom window as the gunman entered. “I couldn’t understand him. It was like gibberish,” Ms. Goss said. “It took a while to figure out shootings, lots of shootings, and that his whole class had jumped out the window.” He landed on his back, and “we made him go to the emergency room,” she said.Two of his fellow engineering students were at the hospital with gunshot wounds, Ms. Goss said. “I think they were just wounded,” she said. “He’s counting on them being just wounded.”As word spread of the shootings, there were first reports of one dead, then 20, then more than 30.“Every time we turned our heads, the total just kept going up,” said Stuart Crowder, 22, a building and construction major, adding that the tension level on campus was still running high.“Right now, I’m actually at a house where I can see the edge of campus, which is very close to the place where the incident actually happened,” Mr. Crowder said. “Probably every about 25 yards, there is an officer or some sort of guard right now with a large gun.”Students, parents and professors jammed phone lines trying to check on loved ones and friends. There were frantic e-mail and text messages, clogged voice mails and busy signals. Kathryn Beard, an education professor at Virginia Tech whose daughter is a student there, said she became frantic when she was barred from entering. “The teacher in me was panicking, and the mother in me was panicking,” she said. “I can’t imagine something like this happening on my campus.”Students theorized about how an outsider — many assumed it was an outsider — could have committed such violence on their campus.“All we’ve seen is that patch of blood,” said Matthew Hall, a senior, indicating a red patch on the sidewalk in front of the building.“It’s weird because this is like the safest place,” Mr. Hall said. “It’s the middle of nowhere,” added his roommate, Ryan Gatterdam.Jessica Abraham, walking nearby, said anyone could pass for a student here by wearing a maroon cap. Maroon and orange are the school colors. “You always see the police here. It seems so safe,” Ms. Abraham said.After the shots and fleeing, the SWAT teams and ambulances, the campus returned to a preternatural quiet, with students talking in small groups or consoling each other. Classes were canceled, and some students had their parents pick them up and take them home.'"
"'07-04-17,'1','Elevate the comparison to $130 million, the minimum take-home pay needed to make it on Alpha magazine’s list of the 25 highest-paid hedge fund managers: the first manager receives $136.1 million; the second $115.8 million.This closely guarded arrangement is completely legal; similar, but less generous deferrals have been commonly used by corporate executives for years. But thanks to the peculiarities of the structure of hedge funds and their enormous growth, the tax-deferred sums that hedge fund managers earn may be far outpacing even the compensation of the most well-paid corporate chieftains.One of the flagship funds at Citadel, a $13.5 billion hedge fund, for example, has deferred at least $1.7 billion since it was founded at the end of 1990. And that does not count what might have been taken out already. Citadel declined to comment.“We pile advantage on advantage for these managers and there doesn’t seem to be any economically logical basis for it,” said John C. Bogle, the founder of the Vanguard Group. “It’s a very well-gilded lily to allow these tax deferrals.”This tax advantage is now coming under scrutiny in Washington, where Congress is looking for ways to reduce the budget deficit, to pay for the Iraq war and to help cover the exploding retirement and health care costs of aging baby boomers.For now, many hedge fund managers are enjoying not only extraordinary profits but the extra benefit of a system almost encouraging them to set up offshore accounts.Most hedge funds are private partnerships; managers are usually paid 2 percent of the money they manage plus 20 percent of the profits the partnership earns. If the fund operates in the United States, any deferral of the pay of the managers means investors lose the tax deduction associated with the compensation expense. As a result, deferred compensation in domestic funds is very uncommon.By setting up an offshore fund, though, hedge fund managers avoid socking their investors with extra taxes. At the same time, it serves to attract tax-exempt investors like pension funds and endowments, as well as foreign investors, two of the most active groups investing in hedge funds today.Once the offshore fund is established, managers can elect to have much of their compensation earned from the offshore fund deferred back into the fund, allowing it to grow tax-free until it is taken out. Managers have to decide ahead of time how much they will defer and they are required to follow a set formula for receiving the money. At the end of the deferral period, they pay ordinary income taxes.There are downsides to this arrangement. For one, the money cannot be spent right away, which can be unfortunate for those looking to add to, say, their antique car collection. Moreover, the money is at risk.Unlike 401(k)s and other so-called qualified plans, deferred compensation is not set aside for the individual but becomes a corporate liability. If the fund goes belly up, the deferred compensation is subject to claims from creditors.“When someone defers money, the reason it’s not taxable to them is it’s not their money,” said Michael G. Tannenbaum, a lawyer with Tannenbaum Helpern Syracuse & Hirschtritt. “It represents a debt in favor of that employee by the company.”Many forces have worked to make hedge funds, as well as private equity funds — both called alternative investments — the darlings of the investment world. Pension funds are drawn to the promise of greater returns with supposedly fewer risks. Low interest rates and widely available financing have fueled a buyout boom largely run on demand from hedge funds for the debt issued to make the buyouts work.But perhaps most notable about the spectacular growth is the huge compensation successful managers receive. Consider a relatively modest fund with $500 million in assets that posts a 16 percent return — on par with the market in 2006. The typical handful or fewer of professionals running the fund would share a management fee of $10 million, plus $16 million in “incentive compensation.”A result is a new class of financial giants. The vast sums of money flowing to a relatively small number of individuals have inspired a vast interest in minimizing taxes.“As long as you stay on the right side of the bright line, all forms of tax avoidance are very smart,” said Mark Yusko, president of Morgan Creek Capital Management, an investment advisory firm. “People pay good money for that.”Offshore deferral arrangements have been around for decades. But in 2004, Congress passed the American Jobs Creation Act, and while a provision known as 409(a) restricted some practices, it also served to highlight their advantages.“I don’t think 409(a) increased the number of deferrals, but it probably made more comfortable the arrangement because it codified what was going on,” Mr. Tannenbaum said.Indeed, deferred-compensation agreements have continued to thrive under the new regulations. Mr. Massey, the consultant, estimates that 100 percent of managers do it; other investors err on the side of “most.”The rationale for doing so is evident, especially as the funds and the compensation get bigger. An increase in the use of leverage — borrowed money to increase bets — has translated to outsize returns, and whopping pay packages, much of them comfortably multiplying in value offshore.“These plans are used more and more in this market, especially with leveraged hedge funds because the more leveraged the fund, the bigger the profit component and the more valuable the deferral of the compensation,” said Mark J. Weinstein, a partner at Hogan & Hartson.Now, Congress is taking a closer look. An amendment limiting deferred compensation to no more than $1 million or the average of the previous five years’ income was added to the Senate version of the minimum wage bill. Lawmakers from both the House and Senate are meeting to work out the differences.Other tax advantages are under the microscope. For example, incentive income at private equity funds, called “the carry,” is taxed at a lower capital gains rate, which is often less than half the rates on ordinary income — a benefit being discussed.To be sure, those who defer taxes face the risk that Congress will raise tax rates on the rich at some future date. But that does not seem to worry most hedge fund managers.“My clients who have quantified the value of the deferral have never factored in the risk of a tax rate increase,” said Mr. Weinstein from Hogan & Hartson. The advantage of tax-free compounding is so strong, he said that “it doesn’t matter because the after-tax yield is still that much better.”'"
"'07-04-17,'1','Either way, the takeover battle is already one of the most unusual in European financial services. A merger with Barclays would make the final entity the biggest in banking, with ABN Amro’s market value Monday reaching 68.3 billion euros, or $92 billion. If that deal does not work out, talks with the rival group would be the first involving an approach by a consortium of lenders, each eyeing a different part of ABN’s business.Such group efforts are more common among private equity firms, which may team up to buy a company and then sell off parts or else allow each member to focus on a separate part of the business. That approach is almost unheard-of in financial services, where institutions are in fierce competition with each other for size and market share.The idea of splitting up ABN Amro was first voiced this year by the Children’s Investment Fund, an activist hedge fund investor that owns less than 3 percent of ABN Amro. Mr. Groenink rejected the idea and told shareholders to vote against it at the company’s annual general meeting on April 26. He argued that a breakup would damage the remaining operations and possibly hurt the company’s credit ratings.Yet, a breakup is exactly what the group led by Royal Bank of Scotland and advised by Merrill Lynch has in mind. Royal Bank is Britain’s second-largest bank, behind HSBC Holdings; Banco Santander is Spain’s largest bank; and Fortis is a Belgian banking group. On Friday, they asked ABN Amro to open discussions about a takeover. They expect to hear back from ABN Amro on Tuesday about a possible meeting.The group of banks would be able to pay more for ABN Amro than Barclays because each one of them would take only that part of ABN that fitted best with its businesses and could generate the most cost savings.“A consortium could pay more because they can justify higher premiums because everyone is picking out the things they want, making synergies more likely,” said Thomas Rothaeusler, an analyst at Bank Sal. Oppenheim in Frankfurt.Also, ABN Amro would be easier to digest for a group splitting the bill rather than Barclays paying alone.If successful, the group approach may set a precedent for further acquisitions in the banking industry, fund managers said.“Everyone is looking for the best synergies possible, picking the businesses they like,” said Marc van de Weijenberg, a fund manager at SNS Asset Management in the Netherlands. “This is quite new for the banking industry.”Fred Goodwin, chief executive of Royal Bank of Scotland, who led an expansion into America that included the acquisition of Charter One Financial for $10.3 billion in 2004, has his eyes set on ABN Amro’s American business, including LaSalle Bank.Santander would profit from ABN Amro’s Brazilian business, Banco Real, and Banca Antonveneta in Italy because they would provide a diversification of revenue at a time when growth in the home market is slowing.Fortis, Belgium’s biggest financial services company, would take on ABN Amro’s Dutch business to create a tight banking network in the region.A team bid would result in far greater cost savings than one by Barclays, analysts said. Royal Bank and Santander could generate 2.56 billion euros in expense savings compared with 1.44 billion euros by Barclays, according to Jean-Pierre Lambert, an analyst at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods in London.Some analysts also said that there was the possibility of more bidding groups emerging. Bank of America, ING, Bank of Montreal and HSBC could all profit from buying parts of ABN Amro and could team up in any possible formation, Mr. Lambert said.ABN Amro, with 4,600 branches in 53 countries, is an attractive target not only because it has businesses in areas like India and Brazil that are growing faster than Europe but also because its share price has been underperforming its peers. ABN Amro’s shares jumped more than 20 percent in the month since it announced takeover talks with Barclays.Barclays’ shares, meanwhile, rose 1.7 percent, to 756 pence, in London Monday. Analysts said Barclays could attract potential bidders like JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America, which could use Barclays’s investment banking arm to help its efforts to build such a business in Europe.'"

She was 83.Ms. Crisp’s brother, Richard Dent, confirmed her death, but said he did not know the cause.Her greatest fame came in 1980, when she made an impassioned plea to the Republican National Convention in Detroit for passage of the equal rights amendment to the Constitution, which would have ended legal distinctions based on sex. The amendment was struggling in state legislatures; a few more state ratifications would have made it part of the Constitution. Although it had had the support of Republican conventions since 1940, the 1980 platform committee voted to oppose it.Ms. Crisp also spoke out against a constitutional amendment to ban abortion, which the party had advocated in 1976 and again supported in 1980, and opposed her party’s opposition to federal financing of abortions.“We are about to bury the rights of over 100 million American women under a heap of platitudes,” she said of those positions.Reagan retorted that Ms. Crisp “should look to herself and see how loyal she’s been to the Republican Party for quite some time.”'"
"'07-04-17,'1','WASHINGTON, April 16 — The Bush administration’s allies in Congress on Monday blocked a bill that would require the White House to disclose the locations of secret prisons run by the Central Intelligence Agency and to reveal the amount spent annually by American intelligence agencies.The vote on the intelligence bill was a blow to Senate Democrats, newly in control of Congress, who had hoped that they would be able to extract more details from the White House about some of the most widely debated intelligence programs begun after the Sept. 11 attacks.Opponents of the legislation, led by Senator Jim DeMint, a South Carolina Republican, won enough support on Monday to prevent the bill from going to the Senate floor for a final vote. But Congressional officials said that negotiations over the measure would continue Tuesday, and Democrats said they were still hopeful the bill could eventually pass.Money for the 2007 intelligence budget was already appropriated last year through the defense spending bill, so defeat of the bill would not hold up money for the 16 agencies that make up the American intelligence network. The White House last week threatened to veto the intelligence bill because it contained several provisions it deemed objectionable, including a requirement that the Bush administration give Congress a detailed report about C.I.A. prison locations and interrogation methods used on high-level terrorism suspects.Since 2002, the C.I.A. has detained and interrogated several top operatives of Al Qaeda, including Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, suspected of being the mastermind of the Sept. 11 attacks. Last year, President Bush announced that all C.I.A prisoners had been transferred to Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, and put in military custody, but that the C.I.A. prisons would remain in operation.'"
"'07-04-17,'1','Others drew fine distinctions among donors. Senator Barack Obama, the Illinois Democrat, has talked of running a new kind of campaign that refuses fund-raising help from federal lobbyists. But a list of his top fund-raisers released over the weekend shows that his campaign has defined the term in an exacting way.At least two of the donors on his list of 130 top fund-raisers were registered federal lobbyists as recently as last year. One, Tom Reed, works at the law and lobbying firm of K & L Preston Gates and earned about $60,000 from lobbying in 2006.Another, Alan Solomont, is one of the best known Democratic donors and helped raise more than $35 million for Senator John Kerry’s presidential campaign in 2004.Mr. Solomont is the founder of a nursing home company and, during the Clinton administration, news reports suggested that he used his clout as a fund-raiser to argue against tougher regulation of nursing homes.Mr. Solomont reported about $90,000 in income last year from lobbying the federal government about Medicare and Medicaid; Mr. Obama has made overhauling health care a focus of his campaign.In an interview, Mr. Solomont said he had withdrawn his lobbyist registration as soon as he signed on as a fund-raiser. “When I joined the campaign, I ended that,” he said.A spokesman for Mr. Obama said Mr. Reed had stopped lobbying also.The spokesman, Bill Burton, said that accepting help from people who had just left lobbying did not breach the campaign’s policy.“The point of this ban on federal lobbyists’ donations,” Mr. Burton said, “is that we don’t want the fund-raising help of someone who is currently lobbying the federal government.”Like its rivals, the Obama campaign has sought financial support from an array of other influence-seekers, including lobbyists at the state level, federal public affairs advocates who are not registered lobbyists, and the chief executives of companies with strong interests in federal policy and legislation.Mr. Obama’s supporters note that his principal rival, Mrs. Clinton, has enlisted the support of several registered lobbyists among her “Hillraisers,” as she calls her biggest fund-raisers.Mr. McCain’s campaign, which trailed its rivals in fund-raising (with about $15 million) but outpaced them in spending (about $11 million), had the highest-paid staff of any campaign in either party.Nine of the roughly 150 people listed on his payroll earned more than $25,000 in the first quarter, including the political strategists Michael Dennehy, whose $51,925 earnings made him the highest-paid staff member listed on any campaign, and Terry Nelson, who made $36,173.Rudolph W. Giuliani, the Republican former mayor of New York, paid seven staffers more than $25,000. Mike DuHaime, his campaign manager, was the second highest paid aide, earning $44,375.Mrs. Clinton paid three staff members more than $25,000; her campaign manager, Patti Solis Doyle, was paid $27,142 in the quarter. But her campaign also reported $154,000 in unpaid bills to her media adviser, Mandy Grunwald, and $277,000 to her main political adviser, Mark Penn.The only employee of Mr. Obama’s campaign to make more than $25,000 for the quarter was Julianna Smoot, his finance director. She earned $26,099 and oversaw $24.8 million in primary fund-raising.None of Mr. Romney’s roughly 150 staff members made that much. “We put a premium on efficiency,” said Kevin Madden, a spokesman. Recalling a trip for Mr. Romney’s campaign announcement in Michigan, he said, “We tripled up in a hotel suite — one of those cheaper ones.”'"

"'07-04-17,'1','A state court judge in Texas dismissed a libel case yesterday filed against The New York Times in response to a series of articles on worker safety at McWane Inc., an Alabama company.The judge, Jerry Calhoon, signed an order granting The Times’s motion for summary judgment after a three-hour hearing in Tyler, Tex., without providing a written opinion, leaving it unclear which argument made by lawyers for The Times proved persuasive.The lawsuit was brought by Mike Adams and the company he owns, Occu-Safe Inc., which provided medical services at McWane’s pipe manufacturing plant in Tyler. Mr. Adams asserted that the articles included false statements about the quality of care provided to McWane employees.The articles, which were accompanied by a television documentary that was broadcast on the PBS program “Frontline,” described environmental and safety violations at the plant and included accusations by employees about their medical treatment. The series, along with a companion series about the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration, won the Pulitzer Prize for public service in 2004.Lawyers for the plaintiffs could not be reached for comment last night.David E. McCraw, vice president and assistant general counsel at The Times, said he expected the plaintiffs to appeal the decision. But, Mr. McCraw said, “we’re confident that the legal arguments that carried the day with the trial court will be sustained on appeal.”Lawyers for The Times argued that the series of articles could not be defamatory because it described conditions and events at the plant truthfully. The newspaper also argued that it accurately conveyed accusations of employees critical of the Tyler plant, entitling the newspaper to summary judgment under Texas law.'"
"'07-04-17,'1','AMMAN, Jordan, April 16 — Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates, visiting the Middle East, will urge leaders to back Iraq’s government and to put aside their doubts about Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki’s ability to curtail sectarian violence, a senior Defense Department official traveling with Mr. Gates said on the plane trip here.Arriving here on Monday, Mr. Gates was planning to hold talks with King Abdullah II on Tuesday on ways that Jordan could contribute to American efforts to stabilize neighboring Iraq.Mr. Gates is on his third visit to the region since taking office in December.Winning greater backing for Mr. Maliki’s Shiite-dominated government from the Sunni governments of the Middle East has become a major emphasis for the Bush administration since it embarked on a new political and military strategy in Iraq earlier this year.“Jordan has always been a strong ally of the United States, and I look forward to discussing with the king how we can contribute to his efforts and how he can contribute to ours,” Mr. Gates told reporters traveling with him. He said Jordan was already providing medical assistance and training help for Iraq.But Mr. Maliki faces skepticism from Sunni Arab countries over his government’s close ties with the Shiite government in Iran, as well as doubts about whether his government can bring stability to the country, said a senior American official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was speaking before the discussions took place.'"

"'07-04-17,'1','Angela Geiger, vice president for constituent relations for the association, said it has primarily “focused on care and support for people going through the disease as well as research.”“It is time for us to step up our efforts to educate the public to do something now,” she added.Alzheimer’s “has escalated into an epidemic,” Ms. Geiger said, citing statistics showing that a new diagnosis is made every 72 seconds and that by 2050, 16 million Americans will have the disease.“It will overwhelm Medicare in less than 25 years unless scientists find a way to cure or prevent it,” Ms. Geiger said.The campaign is vital, she added, because most Americans are ignorant about Alzheimer’s. A survey released by the association yesterday found that although almost half of Americans say they know someone who has the disease, 94 percent said they do not know much about it.Nearly 9 out of 10 Americans do not know it is a leading cause of death, the survey showed. But Alzheimer’s is the seventh leading cause of death, according to the Centers for Disease Control, developing in one in eight people after age 65 and one in two after age 85.Each of the three print ads in the campaign, created by TG Madison of Atlanta, features a blurry sepia photograph of a person with Alzheimer’s over which is superimposed text in bold type, some in purple, the association’s official color. (The people shown in the campaign are models.)One ad depicts a man holding his chin in his hand and says, “Someone suffering from Alzheimer’s will lose the ability to form thoughts, remember simple words and ultimately communicate. You can be their voice. Alzheimer’s is the seventh leading cause of death in the United States. It’s time to speak up.”Another ad says: “Many Alzheimer’s sufferers will slowly lose control of their bodies. They need you to move their cause forward.” The third ad says: “As their brains continue to shrink, people with Alzheimer’s will feel trapped in their own minds. They need you to open everyone else’s.”The ads urge readers to “take action against Alzheimer’s. Go to actionalz.org,” a site created by Undisclosed Location, an agency in Chicago.John Carter, executive creative director of TG Madison, said his agency wanted the ads to be “a little bit in your face. We wanted readers to sit back and think there really is a big problem, that something needs to be done. The visuals illustrate the emotions of what Alzheimer’s sufferers go through.”Ms. Geiger said the value of the media used in the campaign is $8 million, but the association’s actual spending is less. TG Madison negotiated discounts for the nonprofit, particularly with Time Warner magazines and Web sites. Previous campaigns for the association ran as public service ads, on a pro bono basis.The print ads are running in magazines like AARP The Magazine , Newsweek, Parade and Time. There are also online ads on Web sites like AOL.com, MSN.com, oprah.com and prevention.com.The campaign also includes a traveling photography and video exhibit featuring more than 30 celebrities. Among them are David Hyde Pierce, Dick Van Dyke, Peter Gallagher, Kate Burton and Olympia Dukakis.Also, Ch. Felicity’s Diamond Jim, the dog that won the 2007 Westminster Dog Show, is featured in the exhibit; the English springer spaniel, known colloquially as James, does therapy work with Alzheimer’s patients. All the celebrities wear purple clothes that bear the word “voice,” “move” or “open.”“I hope the campaign will raise awareness of what the disease is, what the threat is, so people will put pressure on Congress” to increase financing, said Mr. Hyde Pierce, a member of the association’s board who has testified in Washington and is the campaign’s spokesman.David Shenk, author of “The Forgetting: Alzheimer’s: Portrait of an Epidemic,” said that many “researchers are very optimistic they can make very significant progress against the disease in the near future. There is a window of opportunity here. It is so depressing the federal government is not stepping up to the plate.”He also suggested the campaign could help dispel the taboo that surrounds discussion of the disease.“We’re talking about a subject that is still in many respects taboo to discuss,” he said. “It’s a terrifying disease, most people don’t understand it very well. We’re naturally afraid of things we don’t understand. The better people can understand Alzheimer’s, the better are our chances of breaking through the taboo.”'"
"'07-04-17,'1','“We’re actually doing very well,” said Rollin B. Stanley, director of the city’s planning and urban design agency, which puts the population at 354,000, about 6,000 higher than the Census Bureau.But the effort to put a positive spin on the population debate — and with it, the hope for a long-awaited renaissance — comes against a difficult backdrop.In March, the Missouri State Board of Education took over the public schools for consistently poor performance. Teachers and parents, who largely opposed the takeover, said the district had been starved for resources to care for some of the neediest students in the country.“Without financial and human resources, we’re set up to fail,” said Chip Clatto, an assistant principal at a school on the north side. “I’m wondering if people on the outside realize that not only are we trying to educate these kids, we’re trying to turn them into citizens when their society has failed them.”Signs of a looming disaster for the district of 35,000 students, mostly poor and black, had been clear for years. In 2004, a national education advocacy group found that only 5 percent of 11th graders in city schools were proficient in reading.“They’ve had a revolving door in and out of the superintendent’s office for some time,” said Michael Casserly, the executive director of the group, Great City Schools. “They’ve had a lot of turmoil, and it’s made it almost impossible for the system to gain any momentum.”In October, St. Louis was identified as “America’s most dangerous city” by a private research firm that publishes an annual crime ranking. Though city officials and some experts criticized the ranking as simplistic, aggravated assaults with guns, considered one of the best gauges of a city’s level of violence, were up more than 30 percent over the past two years, according to the Police Executive Research Forum.“A few people are responsible for most of the crime, and we’re targeting those people,” said Barbara A. Geisman, the city’s director of development. “The vast majority of St. Louis is as safe as any place in the suburbs.”But recently there was more bad news from law enforcement in the case of the World Series tickets. One of the best moments of civic pride in recent years — the Cardinals’ victory last fall — was tainted. Chief Joe Mokwa recommended that 8 of the 15 officers be suspended for two weeks and be reduced in rank for a minimum of one year.“They’re not thieves,” Mr. Mokwa said when announcing the punishment. “They made a mistake.”Even the weather got the better of the city last summer, when a storm knocked out power to hundreds of thousands of customers for more than a week. Tempers flared as the power company was unable to restore service quickly, with utility workers from as far away as Arizona ultimately enlisted to help.Rebuilding, and rebranding, St. Louis when some basic quality of life indicators point in the wrong direction has not been easy. And while the city’s population has shrunk, its sprawling suburbs have grown. The metropolitan area’s population is more than 2.6 million.“This is a city that at one point was the fourth largest in the United States,” said Richard B. Rosenfeld, a professor of criminology at the University of Missouri, St. Louis. “The distance we’ve fallen from the status of being a major national city does affect St. Louisans.”The city has retained attractions like Forest Park, excellent universities and a vibrant arts scene. But vast sections of North St. Louis show what happens when people leave town in big numbers: What is left is a shell of a city, boarded up, rotting, populated by the most impoverished. Residents, mostly black, are still fleeing these parts of town.For years, experts said, as the population dwindled, there was no sense of urgency about how the city could come back. Now there is. Last year, for instance, the city developed a new land use plan for the first time since 1947. And a state tax credit program has been spurring investment in some forgotten parts of the city.Some neighborhoods, like Lafayette Square, are even thriving.Since 1999, according to the Downtown St. Louis Partnership, a civic group, 62 historic buildings have been redeveloped for residences and businesses, 12 are currently being remodeled and about 20 conversions are in the planning stages. And according to the city, the two-square-mile downtown area has over 9,000 residents — 6,300 more than in 2000.“There’s a young middle-class movement beginning,” said James Neal Primm, a retired professor and author of “Lion of the Valley,” an extensive history of St. Louis. “My overall reaction is that there should be a lot more. But there is something going on.”Dr. Primm’s grandson, Chris Termini, 29, lives in one of the new downtown lofts, in an area that was unfit for comfortable living just 10 years ago. At night, the sidewalk cafes are full. Joggers pass; dog walkers idle.“We walk everywhere for food and entertainment,” Mr. Termini said. “It’s great.”Mr. Stanley, the city planner, had all this in mind when he challenged the Census Bureau’s 2003 population estimate. St. Louis won that dispute, successfully arguing that it did not lose 17,000 people between 2000 and 2003 — rather 50. “That’s five-zero,” said Mr. Stanley, a Canadian by birth with great love for St. Louis.This year, he said he had a feeling that the bureau would say St. Louis was down again. And it did, giving the city an estimated population of 347,180 — slightly less than the 2000 population count of 348,200.That is just plain wrong, Mr. Stanley said, adding that his challenge of the estimate is ready to go.Win or lose, officials will probably not know with any certainty who lives in St. Louis until the next national count, in 2010, because interim figures are based on less accurate estimates.“We have to wait,” Professor Rosenfeld said. “I think it’s clear that the rate of decline we’ve seen through the last decades is not going to continue. The question is whether we’ll see a net increase.”'"
"'07-04-17,'1','MEMPHIS, April 16 — Senator John McCain of Arizona acknowledged Monday that his fellow Republicans “forgot who we were” in recent years by spending too much, and said that as president he would rely on low taxes, greater fiscal restraint and free trade to lift the nation’s economy.Mr. McCain, whose presidential campaign has been viewed with suspicion by some conservatives because of his initial opposition to the Bush administration’s tax cuts, used the first major economic address of his campaign to reaffirm his commitment to the free market but said he would move to overhaul the nation’s unemployment programs to help people find jobs in the new economy. And he had some strong words for the way his fellow Republicans governed when they controlled Congress.“Worst of all, we forgot who we were: tight-fisted stewards of the federal treasury who keep our priorities straight,” Mr. McCain said in a speech to the Economic Club of Memphis. “We asked Americans to make us the governing party, and we rewarded them by becoming the party of government.”After complaining that Congress had spent money on an indoor rain forest and studying the DNA of bears in Montana (“without knowing whether we needed to solve a criminal case or a paternity suit”), Mr. McCain restated his support for giving the president a line-item veto. Even without it, though, he pledged vetoes of pork-laden bills that drive up government spending without improving government services.“My goodness, when disaster strikes, the government isn’t even ready to deliver drinking water to dehydrated babies or rescue the aged and infirm trapped in a hospital with no electricity,” he said, in an apparent allusion to the government’s response to Hurricane Katrina in 2005.Mr. McCain spoke strongly in favor of free trade but said the government needed to adjust to help workers who had lost their jobs in a changing economy. “We have an unemployment insurance program straight out of the 1950s,” he said.'"
"'07-04-17,'1','HOUSTON, April 16 — Tyson Foods and ConocoPhillips have cooked up a new recipe for your pickup truck.The two companies announced Monday that they were forming an alliance to produce and market diesel fuel made from pork, poultry and beef fat. It was another sign that farmers and agribusinesses, which are now producing corn for ethanol, will be playing an increasingly large part in the country’s energy future. The new brew should be available at the neighborhood filling station by the end of the year.The companies said that the diesel, which will be shipped and distributed through existing pipelines from ConocoPhillips refineries, would burn cleaner than conventional diesel. Much of the feedstock for the fuel will come from several Tyson rendering plants.“This strategic alliance is a big win for the entire agricultural sector because it paves the way for great participation of fats and oils in renewable fuels,” said Richard L. Bond, Tyson’s president and chief executive.ConocoPhillips, the third-largest American oil company, began producing some diesel from soybean oil last year at a plant in Cork, Ireland. The processing technology for the fat-based diesel was developed and successfully tested at the Irish plant.'"
"'07-04-17,'1','MIAMI, April 16 — More than a dozen prospective jurors were questioned Monday as jury selection began in the trial of Jose Padilla and two co-defendants accused of providing material support to terrorists.Judge Marcia G. Cooke of Federal District Court ruled that prosecutors could make reference to the Sept. 11 attacks. But Judge Cooke said they would not be allowed to suggest that Mr. Padilla, a Brooklyn-born American who was declared an enemy combatant by President Bush in 2002, and his co-defendants had been involved in the attacks.“Any idea, through inference or otherwise, that these defendants are connected to 9/11 is not available to the government in this case,” she said. “Anything connected to it evokes such negativity that, if it’s not what this case is about, should not be brought into this case.”Selecting 12 jurors and six alternates is expected to take about two weeks. The trial could last until September. Some of the prospective jurors questioned Monday expressed knowledge of the case or recognized Mr. Padilla’s name. One panelist who said he felt biased against Muslims or Arabs was excused from the jury pool of more than 300.“It would provide some difficulty for me to be open-minded when the subject is one of terror,” the man said. “On the basis of likelihood, I would say guilty.”The defendants are accused of participating in a “North American support cell” that provided money, goods and recruits abroad to assist “global jihad.”'"
"'07-04-17,'1','Kraft Foods is again demonstrating its unhappiness with its largest agency partner, JWT, by shifting the creative duties for six brands to other agencies. Kraft spent more than $160 million to advertise the brands in major media last year, according to TNS Media Intelligence, a division of Taylor Nelson Sofres that tracks ad spending.JWT, which has worked for Kraft for eight decades, is responding by forming a dedicated unit, called Team Kraft, to focus on its remaining assignments. The losses affect about a third of the business that Kraft has at JWT, part of the WPP Group, and include Oscar Mayer, which the agency made the star of two popular commercial jingles.The creative assignment for one brand, Oscar Mayer Lunchables packaged meals, is being shifted immediately to Draft FCB in Chicago, part of the Interpublic Group of Companies, from the Chicago office of JWT. That assignment, with spending last year of $42.4 million, TNS reported, was placed in review last month.The assignments for the other brands, to create ads for North America, were placed in review yesterday. The review will include agencies that do not work for Kraft as well as those that do, said Renee Zahery, a Kraft spokeswoman.The review is for these products in North America, with their TNS spending data: the rest of the Oscar Mayer brand, $46.3 million; Grey Poupon mustard, $355,500; Kraft Singles cheese, $29.7 million; Ritz crackers, $32.1 million; and Triscuit crackers, $12.8 million.In the 1960s and 1970s, JWT Chicago created the Oscar Mayer jingles that begin, “Oh, I wish I were an Oscar Mayer wiener” and “My bologna has a first name, it’s O-S-C-A-R.”Kraft began shifting creative assignments from JWT Chicago in January 2006, when Kraft mayonnaise left for McGarry Bowen in New York. Last month, the creative duties for Miracle Whip went to the Chicago office of DDB Worldwide, part of the Omnicom Group.'"
"'07-04-17,'1','Nixon is the fifth president to come under the scrutiny of Mr. Dallek, author of generally acclaimed books on Franklin D. Roosevelt, Lyndon B. Johnson, John F. Kennedy and Ronald Reagan. This time he has chosen to pair the president with the adviser he describes as a “kind of co-president,” surmising that each would be a foil for the other. The 700-page result, “Nixon and Kissinger: Partners in Power,” to be published next week by HarperCollins, shows that their extraordinary relationship was as much rivalry as partnership, as two driven men sparred over which of them would get the limelight both craved.Even as they struggled together to find a way out of Vietnam, to pursue detente with the Soviet Union and to plan the opening to China, each complained incessantly in private about the other’s neuroses and instability. Nixon appears at times to have taken a sadistic pleasure in flaunting his casual anti-Semitism before his Jewish national security adviser. Mr. Kissinger was reliably flattering to the president’s face while cultivating the press to ensure a generous share of credit for the administration’s initiatives.“Harsh life experiences had made both men cynical about people’s motives and encouraged convictions that outdoing opponents required a relaxed view of scruples,” Mr. Dallek writes. “Ironically, their cynicism would also make them rivals who could not satisfy their aspirations without each other.”As Mr. Dallek pored over the new raw material that had attracted him to his subjects — the Kissinger transcripts, hundreds of newly released Nixon tapes and the voluminous diaries of H. R. Haldeman, Nixon’s chief of staff — he realized that this most secretive of presidencies had gradually become the most transparent. The tapes and transcripts both Nixon and Mr. Kissinger had preserved for their own use, out of a shared anxiety about how they would be remembered, have created an incomparably detailed record of their years in power.“It’s the greatest asset a historian of an American president could ever have,” Mr. Dallek said in an interview in the top-floor study of his Northwest Washington town house, which looks out on leafy Rock Creek Park. He added, ruefully, “We’ll never have anything like it again.”Mr. Dallek said he chose research projects partly based on what new material was becoming available from the excruciatingly slow declassification and review process at the overworked National Archives. He interviewed Mr. Kissinger, Alexander M. Haig, Brent Scowcroft and other still-living figures from the Nixon era, he said, but the book, with more than 1,300 endnotes, is built almost entirely from the contemporary record as preserved on paper and tape.For a denizen of the archives, Mr. Dallek is an engaging man. He spent four decades teaching at Columbia, the University of California at Los Angeles, Boston University and Dartmouth, and he has an infectious enthusiasm for his material that makes him seem considerably younger than his 72 years. He and his wife, Geri, have two grown children, Rebecca and Matthew, who in 2004 published a book of his own on Reagan’s early political career.It is easy to see what sparked the son’s interest. Robert Dallek cackles with delight as he shows off a 1964 Johnson-Humphrey campaign button from his collection, on which Hubert Humphrey’s mug is a bit bigger than the president’s. “Johnson was furious!” he exclaims, in the accent of his Brooklyn upbringing. “Just furious!”Later, reading aloud rich snippets from the Nixon records, he cries: “Can you believe this? Amazing!” He is equal parts enthralled and appalled to find Nixon blaming the press coverage of the massacre at My Lai in Vietnam on “those dirty rotten Jews from New York,” and to find Mr. Kissinger describing his boss to aides and reporters as “that madman,” “our drunken friend” and “the meatball mind.”In the 1980s Mr. Dallek spent four years studying psychoanalysis at a California research institute. He said he believes applying too much psychology to biography can be “reductionist,” but his book makes a compelling case for the underlying similarity of his two subjects as men whose insecurities were as striking as their talents.Mr. Dallek, who describes himself as “an old-fashioned Franklin Roosevelt Democrat,” gives both men credit for their accomplishments: Nixon for China, Mr. Kissinger for shuttle diplomacy in the Mideast. “These guys function at a very high level, despite their pathologies,” he said.From his immersion in the painful episodes of Nixon’s drinking, middle-of-the-night phone calls and relentless self-doubt, Mr. Dallek said, he “came away having greater sympathy and compassion for Nixon.”He added, “He was a man who suffered a great deal emotionally.”For Mr. Kissinger he seems to have developed no comparable feeling. “What should I call him?” Mr. Dallek said. “A brilliant scoundrel.” (Mr. Kissinger did not respond to a request for comment on the book, excerpts of which were published this month in Vanity Fair.)Reading about the bitter internecine clashes and following the telephone soundtrack of the Nixon administration, it is impossible not to wonder how a similarly documented account of the current Bush White House might read. The writing of “Nixon and Kissinger” coincided almost exactly with the Iraq war, and Mr. Dallek said he was haunted by the parallels long before last year’s revelation that Mr. Kissinger, 83, has occasionally advised President Bush.One pattern in particular seems relevant, he said: the reassurances that Nixon and Mr. Kissinger continually offered each other between 1969 and 1973 about the likely success of each of their moves in Vietnam, from the incursion into Cambodia to the prospects for “Vietnamization,” the gradual shift of the burden of combat from American to South Vietnamese troops.With them, as with other presidents he has studied, “there’s a degree of autointoxication,” Mr. Dallek said.“They convince themselves of what they want to believe,” he continued. He said he sensed the same phenomenon in the Bush administration and what he called the plan for “Iraqization” to reduce American involvement in the current war.But even as he waxed sarcastic about the current White House, the historian in Mr. Dallek interrupted the pundit. “Well,” he declared, “we’ll have to wait 30 or 40 years to make real judgments.”Presumably those judgments will have to arrive without tapes and transcripts, but Mr. Dallek has high hopes for a new kind of minute evidence that postdates the Nixon era. “I think the e-mails,” he said, “will give us an incredible record of how things happened.”'"
"'07-04-17,'1','People who live in communities with a lot of guns are more likely to kill themselves, a new study says.The findings, the researchers say, add weight to the argument that when people have less access to guns, they are less likely to commit suicide. Earlier research raised the question of whether people intent on suicide would simply switch to another equally lethal method if unable to find a gun.In the new report, in the current issue of The Journal of Trauma, researchers from the Harvard School of Public Health said they had found evidence that “the ready availability of firearms is likely to have the greatest effect on suicide rates in groups characterized by more impulsive behavior.”The researchers, led by Dr. Matthew Miller, compared statistics on gun ownership by state with statistics on suicide. They also took into account factors like poverty, mental illness and drug abuse.When they looked at the 15 states with the highest firearm ownership, the researchers found that twice as many people committed suicide as in the six states with the lowest firearm ownership. The population in each group of states was about the same, the researchers said.In 2002, more than 30,000 Americans killed themselves, with just over half using a gun.Firearms are used in only 5 percent of attempts, the study said, even though, with a 90 percent fatality rate, they cause more than half the deaths. So even a small decline in the number of attempts involving guns could mean many fewer deaths, the researchers said.'"
"'07-04-17,'1','Kraft Foods is again demonstrating its unhappiness with its largest advertising agency partner, JWT, by shifting the creative duties for six brands to other agencies. Kraft spent more than $160 million to advertise the brands in major media last year, according to TNS Media Intelligence, a division of Taylor Nelson Sofres that tracks ad spending.JWT, which has worked for Kraft for eight decades, is responding to the significant losses by forming a dedicated unit, called Team Kraft, to focus on its remaining assignments. The losses affect about a third of the business that Kraft has at JWT, part of the WPP Group, and include Oscar Mayer, which the agency made the star of two popular commercial jingles.The creative assignment for one brand, Oscar Mayer Lunchables packaged meals, is being shifted immediately to Draft FCB in Chicago, part of the Interpublic Group of Companies, from the Chicago office of JWT. That assignment, with spending estimated at $42.4 million, had been placed in review last month.The assignments for the other five brands, to create ads to run in North America, are being placed in review today. The review will include agencies that do not work for Kraft as well as those that do, said Renee Zahery, a spokeswoman for Kraft North America in Northfield, Ill.The review is for these products in North America, with their TNS spending data: the rest of the Oscar Mayer brand, $46.3 million; Grey Poupon mustard, $355,500; Kraft Singles cheese, $29.7 million; Ritz crackers, $32.1 million; and Triscuit crackers, $12.8 million.'"
"'07-04-17,'1','Nor is Mr. Bashir the only person in such a position. The on-and-off leader of the janjaweed militias, Musa Hilal, has unleashed his soldiers with particular brutality on another black African tribe, the Zaghawa. You can drive for hours through Zaghawa regions of Darfur where every single village has been burned; only corpses are left, and some of those have been stuffed into wells to poison them.Yet, according to people from Musa Hilal’s hometown, his own mother is Zaghawa.Likewise, the rebels of Darfur have sometimes turned on their own tribes — raping and murdering their own people, or those of allied tribes.So what motivates these people? Not ancient hatreds, but greed. They are not Taliban-style extremists, but rather amoral, ruthless, calculating opportunists.Mr. Bashir and others in his government faced a genuine problem back in 2003: African tribes (including the Zaghawa) were staging a rebellion in Darfur. Calling in the army to fight the rebels was problematic because many soldiers in the regular army are from African tribes in Darfur and might not be reliable in combat against their brethren.So Mr. Bashir adopted an approach he had already used against rebels in southern Sudan. He armed irregular militias and gave them license to wipe out civilians and depopulate large areas. This would deprive the rebels of their base of support and send a warning to any other tribe in Sudan that might contemplate a rebellion.Presumably Mr. Bashir guessed that foreigners might not like the idea of mass murder. But he could deny visas to prying journalists, and he had Chinese diplomatic protection at the United Nations.So after weighing the pros and cons, Mr. Bashir decided that genocide was the simplest counterinsurgency method. Some of the marauders were driven by prejudice, and Arab attackers routinely shouted racial epithets against blacks. But the leaders —— they were just cynics. Musa Hilal and some of the rebel commanders seemed to view murder and rape simply as paths to accumulate power and livestock.All this makes genocide easier to stop than people imagine. Where it arises from a weighing of costs and benefits, then it is possible for outsiders to impose additional costs and change the outcome. That’s what we need to do. The U.S. should lead other countries in pushing hard on all sides for a negotiated peace agreement among the warring factions, for that is ultimately the best hope to end the slaughter in Darfur and in neighboring areas in Chad and the Central African Republic.I find President Bashir’s ruthlessness pretty easy to understand. What is harder to fathom is President Bush’s refusal to stand up to the genocide for four years. Why not impose a no-fly zone, why not hold an international conference on Darfur, why not invite survivors to the White House for a photo-op, why not give a prime-time speech about Darfur?Perhaps the explanation for Mr. Bush’s passivity is the same as the explanation for Mr. Bashir’s brutality. Maybe Mr. Bush has made his calculations, looked at the number of calls and letters he gets about Darfur, weighed the pros and cons, and decided that Americans really don’t care enough about genocide to make him pay a major price for allowing it to continue.'"

"'07-04-18,'1','During the trial, which began in March, federal prosecutors, led by Cliff Stricklin, an assistant United States attorney, sought to portray Mr. Nacchio as a man motivated by greed, who knowingly deceived analysts by concealing the company’s mounting money problems, while simultaneously unloading his own stock options.Mr. Nacchio’s defense team was led by Herbert J. Stern, a prominent lawyer who as a young Manhattan prosecutor helped investigate the murder of Malcolm X and was acclaimed for cracking down on political corruption as a federal prosecutor in New Jersey in the 1970s.Mr. Stern contended that Mr. Nacchio was a passionately optimistic executive who may have misjudged Qwest’s financial future but believed deeply in his upbeat prognostications. Moreover, Mr. Stern asserted that Mr. Nacchio needed to sell stock because the options were scheduled to expire.But Mr. Nacchio, prosecutors said, set aggressive financial targets that were wildly out of step with the warnings he received from fellow executives about Qwest’s failure to increase its recurring revenue.A number of former Qwest executives, including Lee Wolfe, a former director of investor relations, testified about a surge of concern over how the company was going to meet its projections and over Qwest’s lopsided reliance on one-time transactions.Nonetheless, prosecutors said Mr. Nacchio continually affirmed a bright financial forecast to analysts, even as the chorus of admonitions from other Qwest executives grew. Finally, in late 2000, when he realized Qwest was facing a significant shortfall, prosecutors said, Mr. Nacchio began unloading his stock options, while still publicly proclaiming the company’s good fortunes. Mr. Nacchio even backdated the sale of the stock to make it appear unrelated to Qwest’s downturn, prosecutors contended.Mr. Stern argued that Mr. Nacchio derived his projections from a report compiled by a consulting firm hired to assess the merger of Qwest and US West in 1999. There was no way Mr. Nacchio could have foreseen a recession in the market, Mr. Stern said.The defense called just three witnesses, one of them Philip F. Anschutz, Qwest’s founder. Mr. Anschutz testified that Mr. Nacchio had come to him despondent over his son’s attempted suicide and wanted to resign, an indication of the enormous pressure Mr. Nacchio was under at the time of the stock sales, the defense said.Under Judge Edward W. Nottingham of Federal District Court, a stickler for punctuality, the trial moved more swiftly than expected. As the proceedings drew to a close, there was speculation as to whether Mr. Nacchio would take the stand to testify about secret government contracts that Qwest was supposedly in line to win. Before the trial, the defense indicated that Mr. Nacchio alone knew about the potentially lucrative contracts, which would have bolstered Qwest’s revenues.But the defense never called Mr. Nacchio; putting him on the stand could have proved risky because he would have faced a relentless cross-examination, legal experts said. As a result, the government contracts were barely mentioned.The federal charges capped a sharp turn of fortune for Mr. Nacchio, the son of a New York longshoreman turned bartender, once heralded for his hard-charging leadership as an executive for AT&T.Hired to lead Qwest in 1997, Mr. Nacchio oversaw the company during a period of revenue growth and acquisitions. But by 2001, Qwest’s stock value had started to sink, and Mr. Nacchio was forced to resign by Qwest’s board in June 2002, the year the federal government began investigating possible accounting fraud at the company. He was indicted by a federal grand jury on Dec. 20, 2005.'"
"'07-04-18,'1','Senator John Cornyn, Republican of Texas, denounced the bill as “a step down the road to a single-payer, government-run health care system.”Democrats said they were merely trying to untie the hands of the secretary of health and human services, so he could negotiate on behalf of 43 million Medicare beneficiaries.“The Department of Veterans Affairs is able to negotiate for lower-priced drugs,” said the Senate majority leader, Harry Reid, Democrat of Nevada. “H.M.O.’s can negotiate. Wal-Mart can negotiate. Why in the world shouldn’t Medicare be able to do that?”The 2003 Medicare law prohibits Medicare from negotiating drug prices, setting prices or establishing a uniform list of covered drugs, known as a formulary.Mr. Reid said the Democrats fell short today because of “the power of the insurance industry and the pharmaceutical industry” and their close ties to Republicans in Congress.But the vote also reflected ineffectual advocacy by Democrats, who were slow in responding to criticism from knowledgeable, well-prepared Republican senators like Charles E. Grassley of Iowa.“Private competition works,” said Mr. Grassley, a principal author of the 2003 Medicare law. “The government has very little experience and a dismal track record figuring out what to pay for drugs.”Big companies that offer the Medicare drug benefit, like Caremark and Medco Health Solutions, “have more market power than Medicare” because they negotiate for tens of millions of people in private health plans, as well as for Medicare recipients, Mr. Grassley said.The House passed a bill requiring the Secretary of Health and Human Services to negotiate drug prices by a vote of 255 to 170 on Jan. 12, just eight days after the new Congress convened. The Senate bill would permit but not require such negotiations.President Bush had threatened to veto either or both versions of the legislation.Neither the House bill nor the Senate bill gives much guidance to Medicare officials on how to negotiate.In creating the drug benefit in 2003, Congress made a radical departure from traditional Medicare, which offers uniform benefits defined by law. Medicare recipients in every state now have a choice of prescription drugs plans with different benefits, premiums, co-payments and deductibles.The 2003 law prohibited the government from interfering in negotiations between drug manufacturers and private companies that provide the Medicare drug benefit. The House and Senate bills would repeal this ban.Employers and health plans typically get discounts on particular drugs in return for encouraging patients to use those medicines, rather than competing products.The Congressional Budget office said that the Senate bill, like the House measure, “would have a negligible effect on federal spending.”“Without the authority to establish a formulary or other tools to reduce drug prices, we believe that the secretary would not obtain significant discounts from drug manufacturers across a broad range of drugs,” the budget office said.The Republican senators who joined Democrats in voting to take up the drug price negotiation bill were Norm Coleman of Minnesota, Susan Collins of Maine, Chuck Hagel of Nebraska, Gordon H. Smith of Oregon, Olympia J. Snowe of Maine and Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania.Some Republicans were prepared to filibuster the Senate bill, but that proved unnecessary.The Senate Republican whip, Trent Lott of Mississippi, said Republicans had blocked consideration of the bill because they did not want to dicker with Democrats over amendments on unrelated issues, “with no happy end in sight.”But Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, predicted that the Senate would vote again on the issue, perhaps on an amendment to a spending bill or other legislation.“The fight will go on,” Mr. Wyden said.'"
"'07-04-18,'1','TORONTO, April 17 (AP) — Daisuke Matsuzaka’s lack of control in a key situation cost him against the Toronto Blue Jays on Tuesday night.Matsuzaka struck out 10 over six innings but forced in the go-ahead run with a bases-loaded walk to Gregg Zaun in the fourth, and Toronto beat the Boston Red Sox, 2-1, despite getting just three hits.Matsuzaka (1-2) retired his first eight batters, and Wily Mo Peña’s third-inning home run gave him a lead, but Lyle Overbay’s single tied the score in the two-run fourth.Jason Frasor, now the closer with B. J. Ryan sidelined by a sprained elbow, got four outs for his first save since Sept. 20, 2005, against Seattle. He retired David Ortiz on a groundout to end the eighth with a runner on, then pitched a 1-2-3 ninth. Manny Ramírez lined out, and Kevin Youkilis and Mike Lowell grounded out.Matsuzaka allowed three hits and three walks in six innings as his earned run average rose to 2.70 from 2.57. He struck out 10 for the second time in three starts. The previous pitcher to reach double-digit strikeouts twice in his first three major league starts was Fernando Valenzuela of the Dodgers in 1981.'"

"'07-04-18,'1','The Coca-Cola Company posted a better-than-expected quarterly profit yesterday as the continued introduction of Coke Zero helped bolster sales in many countries, allaying investors’ concerns that the soft drink business was stagnant.Shares of Coca-Cola rose sharply after the company reported strong gains in emerging markets like Russia, China and Africa and moderate gains in developed markets like Japan and the European Union, offsetting an expected decline in North America.Coke, like its rival PepsiCo, has suffered amid an industrywide slowdown in the North American market as health-conscious consumers avoid soft drinks in favor of bottled waters, teas and energy drinks. While Coke’s chief executive, E. Neville Isdell, acknowledged that weakness yesterday, he delivered an optimistic message.“We continue to expect 2007 to be weak,” he said in a conference call with analysts. “But we do expect to begin seeing sequential improvement in the second half of the year as we execute against our key goals.”Mark Swartzberg, an analyst at the investment firm Stifel Nicolaus, called the results “the best evidence yet that a nearly three-year turnaround is working and that the company’s long-term targets are sound and being achieved.”'"
"'07-04-18,'1','New York State has settled a lawsuit over its treatment of mentally ill prisoners, agreeing to end 23-hour-a-day solitary confinement and limiting the use of a bread-and-cabbage diet and other punishments. The lawsuit, filed in Federal District Court in Manhattan in 2002 by several prisoners’ rights groups against the administration of Gov. George E. Pataki, claimed that the state had failed to provide the treatment the prisoners needed and that solitary confinement had led to severe psychiatric deterioration, self-mutilation and suicide. The agreement with the administration of Gov. Eliot Spitzer, which still requires court approval, means that the mentally ill who are confined to special housing units will get at least two hours of treatment outside their cells each day and as many as four hours’ additional recreation time. As attorney general, Mr. Spitzer represented the Pataki administration in the case, but he said last year that he would not hesitate to change course as governor.'"
"'07-04-18,'1','Five weeks ago, a Virginia Tech student walked into a nondescript gun store next to a pawn shop in Roanoke, Va., and paid $571 for a Glock 9-millimeter handgun and a box of ammunition.On Monday, the student, Cho Seung-Hui, made a horrible kind of history by using that gun and another pistol to go on a murderous rampage at the university, in Blacksburg, Va., before taking his own life.As described by John Markell, the owner of the store, Roanoke Firearms, the purchase was a routine transaction. Virginia requires residents to present two forms of identification to buy a gun, as well pass a computerized background check, and Mr. Cho showed a salesman his driver’s license, a checkbook and his green card, because he had immigrated with his family from South Korea.“He must have bought a lot more ammo somewhere else,” Mr. Markell said.But this unremarkable purchase by Mr. Cho is drawing attention to Virginia’s gun laws, which some gun-control advocates described as lax. The purchase has prompted calls from several Democrats and at least one leading presidential candidate, John Edwards, for measures to restrict gun sales, even as they proclaimed their support for the Second Amendment.But Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, who is also running for president, said, “This brutal attack was not caused by nor should it lead to restrictions on the Second Amendment, which guarantees an individual right to keep and bear arms.”Some commentators who oppose what they see as unconstitutional limits on gun ownership said they feared gun control advocates would successfully use the Virginia tragedy to bolster their position, especially with Democrats’ new power in Washington. “We see calls for gun control but we may not see as much empathy for calls for armed self-defense,” said David Codrea, a blogger and a columnist for Guns Magazine.Many advocates on both sides of this debate, including the National Rifle Association and the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence, suggested they were waiting for more information about the gunman and how he acquired his weapons.It remained unclear yesterday how and when Mr. Cho got another gun, described in a search warrant as a Walther .22-caliber semiautomatic pistol, although one law enforcement official suggested that he might have purchased it at a pawnshop in February. At a news conference yesterday, local officials said both weapons appeared to have been acquired legally.Virginia restricts gun buyers to the purchase of one handgun a month, in an effort to prevent bulk re-sales; law enforcement officers must issue a concealed carry permit to almost anyone who applies.In Congress, perhaps the strongest response to the Virginia shootings came from Representative Carolyn McCarthy, a New York Democrat whose husband was killed and son was seriously wounded by a gunman on the Long Island Rail Road more than a decade ago. Ms. McCarthy pushed House leaders on Tuesday to move quickly on a bill, stalled in previous Congresses that would improve databases used to conduct criminal background checks on gun purchaser.For the most part, Congressional leaders limited themselves to expressing their condolences to the victims, their families and the students and faculty at Virginia Tech. Several suggested that it was too soon to make policy decisions.“I hope there’s not a rush to do anything,” said the Senate majority leader, Harry Reid, Democrat of Nevada. “We need to take a deep breath.”Even Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, who helped spearhead a ban on assault weapons more than a decade ago, said it was too early to discuss additional gun control measures.The muted political response was a testament to political realities in which many Democrats who came to Congress as part of the new majority were elected on pro-gun platforms, and at a time when the party is trying to reach out to voters in the South and the West.“There are several gun control advocates who have behind their name today, r-e-t, retired,” said Senator Larry E. Craig, an Idaho Republican who has long been a vocal pro-gun voice in Congress. “Some of it was voluntary. Some of it was involuntary.”In Virginia and on gun-rights blogs, some critics were challenging Virginia Tech rules that prohibit gun owners from carrying their weapons on campus. A committee of the State House of Delegates has considered legislation to override the ban, which is common at many other colleges.No one can say for sure if allowing students and faculty members to carry arms would have prevented the rampage on Monday, said Philip Van Cleave, president of the Virginia Citizens Defense League. “But they wouldn’t die like sheep, at least, but more like a wolf with some fangs, able to fight back.”But Blaine Rummel, a board member of Virginians for Public Safety, an anti-gun group, disputed the notion that arming more people would reduce violence. “Virginia is second in the nation in the ease of getting handguns,” Mr. Rummel said. “If easy availability was a solution, Virginia Tech wouldn’t be in mourning today.”'"

"'07-04-18,'1','Similarly, the company projected that gross margin for the year would be about 51 percent, higher than its earlier forecast of about 50 percent.Investors applauded the prospect that margin pressure was finally easing. The report was released after the market’s close Tuesday, and Intel’s shares rose 47 cents, or 2.24 percent, in after-hours trading. In regular trading, Intel’s stock increased 29 cents, to close at $20.98 a share.The company, had “strong momentum and relatively stable pricing” during the first quarter, said Paul S. Otellini, Intel’s chief executive.Intel reported a profit of $1.61 billion, or 27 cents a share, compared with $1.36 billion, or 23 cents a share, a year earlier. Intel executives said a tax benefit of $300 million raised earnings by 5 cents a share. Intel’s first-quarter sales declined 1 percent, to $8.85 billion, from $8.94 billion.Analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial forecast earnings of 22 cents a share, excluding the tax benefit, and sales of $8.9 billion.Mr. Bryant said Intel’s profit improved in large part because average selling prices stayed relatively stable. New microprocessor products for notebook computers and servers helped Intel keep prices up.For the last several years Intel has been locked in a price war with Advanced Micro Devices, a battle that has taken its toll on profit margins at both companies. But while Intel appears to be reviving, A.M.D. surprised investors last week by announcing that it would report revenue in the first quarter of $1.23 billion, far below the $1.53 billion analysts had forecast.A.M.D. blamed lower selling prices for its processors, as well as lower unit sales, and said it would make cutbacks in hiring and spending to further reduce operating costs. The company said it would reduce 2007 capital spending by about $500 million from $2.5 billion. A.M.D. is scheduled to release its earnings report Thursday.Cody Acree, an analyst with Stifel Nicolaus, called Intel’s quarter “encouraging,” and said it appeared Intel was gaining back lost market share in virtually all categories. “In a challenging environment we think Intel is executing well, especially when you look at the poor executing of its nearest competitor,” he said.Looking ahead to the second quarter, Intel expects revenue of $8.2 billion to $8.8 billion, below analysts’ forecast for revenue of $8.86 billion. But Mr. Bryant told analysts that the slowdown was in part a normal seasonal pattern.Intel executives Tuesday pointed to developments in chip-making that are enabling it to pack more features into its processors. That, in turn, is helping keep costs down and prices stable. At a developer conference in Beijing on Monday, Intel described plans to feature a “system on a chip” in the coming quarters, a move that leads to increased efficiency, lower prices and less energy use.The company also said Tuesday that its corporate restructuring was a quarter ahead of schedule, and that it had already reduced its headcount by 6,000 workers, to about 92,000.'"
"'07-04-18,'1','The health care products maker Johnson & Johnson said yesterday that its first-quarter profit fell 22 percent as a big charge for a recent acquisition offset record sales driven by last year’s purchase of a stable of top consumer health products.Still, the company roundly beat analysts’ expectations, sending its shares up $1.53, to $64.55, with trading double their normal volume on the New York Stock Exchange.J.& J., which is based in New Brunswick, N.J., and makes contact lenses, prescription drugs and baby products, reported net income of $2.57 billion, or 88 cents a share, compared with $3.31 billion, or $1.10 a share, in the first quarter of 2006.Excluding a charge of $807 million for the February acquisition of Conor Medsystems, the company said that net income was $1.16 a share. In the year-ago quarter, results were bolstered by an after-tax gain of $368 million from the fee J.& J. received after the medical device maker Guidant backed out of an acquisition agreement and instead was purchased by Boston Scientific.Sales at Johnson & Johnson totaled $15.04 billion, up nearly 16 percent, from $12.99 billion a year earlier.New concerns about the safety and effectiveness of the company’s Cypher and other drug-coated stents — metal mesh cylinders that prop open arteries and release medicine to keep them open — cut their sales more than 25 percent, to $503 million. That hurt revenue in the medical devices and diagnostics division, which edged up 6 percent, to $5.32 billion.'"
"'07-04-18,'1','“Taking trucks off the road, minimizing their impact on communities, is going to mean safer, cleaner, quieter streets for generations to come,” the mayor said. “This really is the beginning of a real transformation for this city.”Yesterday’s announcement was held in a chilly warehouse in front of mounds of smelly garbage at the Staten Island Transfer Station. Afterward, the mayor, surrounded by an entourage of sanitation and rail officials, went outside and, in a symbolic gesture, waved a railroad lantern at a waiting locomotive.The city began testing the line on April 2, moving some garbage to New Jersey from the transfer station, which receives garbage from all over the borough. The city expects to begin hauling all of Staten Island’s garbage by ray by May 1.Although the Staten Island segment of the mayor’s plan is under way, city officials made it clear yesterday that other key components of the transformation — mainly building marine transfer stations in Brooklyn, Queens and Manhattan — could still be years away as the city seeks environmental permits from the state. One of those, on the Upper East Side at 91st Street, has been beset by local and political opposition.For years, the city’s garbage went to the mammoth Fresh Kills landfill, to the dismay of Staten Island political leaders and residents. Since the landfill was closed to residential trash in 2001, the city has struggled with how to dispose of the 12,000 tons of garbage it collects each day from homes, schools and municipal buildings.Now, the vast majority of that waste is shipped out by truck, eventually ending up in landfills in South Carolina, Virginia and other states. Some goes to an incinerator in Essex County, N.J.Under the new plan, each borough is responsible for putting its garbage into containers at private or city-operated transfer stations. From there it will be sent out of state by barges or rail.City Councilman Michael E. McMahon, who represents the northern part of the borough, called yesterday’s announcement a Golden Spike moment, a reference to completion of the transcontinental railroad in the 1860s.“Firstly, we will move Staten Island’s trash by sealed containers over rail, and secondly, we are reconnecting our borough to the rest of the continent by railroad,” he said.'"
"'07-04-18,'1','Factoring in the costs associated with planting and upkeep, New York City’s street trees provide an annual benefit of about $122 million, according to the Parks Department. The study concludes that New York receives $5.60 in benefits for every dollar spent on trees.Trees in lower-density areas, typically in Queens and on Staten Island, are generally more valuable than those in Manhattan and high-density areas of Brooklyn and the Bronx because they provide the greatest environmental benefits, according to Fiona Watt, chief of forestry and horticulture for the city.“Trees in front of single-family homes will provide greater shade, and it’s intuitive that a large tree in front of a home seems to resonate more than the same tree in front of a huge apartment building,” she said.Trees with large leaves, like London plane trees or maple trees, are more valuable because they provide more shade and consume more carbon dioxide.The information on the economics of the city’s trees gives the Parks Department concrete evidence when it comes to budget discussions, Mr. Benepe said. “We plan on using these values as a baseline to say that this is what we have now, and argue for additional funds to plant more trees,” he said.The tree census found that Queens has about 40 percent of the city’s street trees, followed by Brooklyn, with about 25 percent; Staten Island, with about 16 percent; the Bronx, with about 10 percent; and Manhattan, with roughly 8 percent.The city has made planting more trees as a small way to improve air quality part of a broad plan developed by Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg to make the city a better place to live by 2030. Mr. Benepe called it “a happy coincidence” that the tree census puts a dollar value on a tree’s environmental benefits at the same time that the city is trying to reduce its carbon dioxide emissions.The first step in determining a tree’s environmental value is measuring the rate at which different tree species absorb pollutants. This is being done at a monitoring station at the University of California that simulates New York’s City’s climate, said Dr. Greg McPherson, the lead designer of the program and the director of the Forest Service’s Center for Urban Forest Research.Dollar values are assigned through an equation that compares carbon dioxide emissions from power plants with the amount of carbon dioxide that a tree species takes in, he said. Power plant smokestack emissions are used because they are easily traceable in the atmosphere, Dr. McPherson said.The computer model determines a tree’s environmental value based on how much carbon it absorbs that would have to be eliminated from the air through some other means, and how much less carbon is emitted by power-generating plants because of a reduced demand for energy resulting from a tree’s shade.To calculate the dollar effect of a tree on property values, the city used a 1988 study in Athens, Ga., that found that homes with a tree in front sell for almost 1 percent more than similar homes without trees.The city took the median value of a single-family home sold in 2005 as a constant and based each tree’s contribution on its size, location and species. A large tree in front of a single-family home would have the highest value, while a small tree in front of an apartment building would have the lowest value.Dr. McPherson said he developed his computer program over the last 25 years by incorporating several studies that showed the economic benefits of trees.“I hope this model provides ammunition for people on the front lines who have to battle for budgets to maintain their trees and expand their urban forests,” he said.'"
"'07-04-18,'1','Not everyone agrees that a threat is imminent, but Washington isn’t asking anyone to help pay for the system.Why, then, are so many people unhappy?It is not the cost. The United States has already spent tens of billions of dollars on the missile shield. A few more billion won’t draw that much attention from Congress or taxpayers.Nor is it Russia’s complaining that the antimissile missiles will chip away at its nuclear position. The 10 interceptor missiles that Washington is proposing to put in Poland could hardly stop Russia’s hundreds of intercontinental ballistic missiles in the event of all-out war.The American antimissile missiles will be placed too close to Russia to be of use against ICBMs fired from anywhere west of the Ural Mountains. If they work, though, the antimissile missiles in Alaska and California could stop a Russian ICBM fired in America’s direction from east of the Urals. The fact is that in tests the antimissile missiles don’t work much of the time, and when they do it is under controlled circumstances that are far from typical in an actual attack.No, what is going on in Europe has less to do with missiles than with diplomacy and European queasiness about American power and influence on the Continent.The European Union is upset because Washington is negotiating bilaterally with Poland and the Czech Republic about something that affects Europe as a whole. The union has been trying for years to patch together a coherent European security and defense policy independent of NATO, and it doesn’t help when member states start cutting deals with Washington on their own.Many Europeans are also offended that the talks are not being routed through NATO, which has been struggling to stay relevant ever since the cold war.“The offer created a situation where it isn’t clear what the role of NATO is in providing collective security,” says Ondrej Liska, a leader of the Czech Green Party, which is a member of the Czech Republic’s governing coalition.NATO will discuss the subject on Thursday.But the Bush administration knows that reaching a consensus on such a delicate subject within the recently expanded NATO, now with 26 member nations, would take longer than it could afford. It is rushing to get the program far enough along that the next administration would be reluctant to kill it.Russia, meanwhile, is upset because the little missile base in Poland and its companion radar base in the Czech Republic would give the American military its largest and most permanent footprint yet in the former territory of the Warsaw Pact.The Russian foreign minister, Sergey V. Lavrov, complained in an article in the Financial Times this month that it was “unacceptable” for the United States to use the European Continent as “their own strategic territory.”Russia’s lower house of Parliament issued a unanimous statement that said talk of the antimissile shield was “already bringing about a new split in Europe and unleashing another arms race.”Is another cold war looming? Not yet. But Poland is buying American F-16s and Russia is moving surface-to-air missiles into Belarus near Poland’s border, and tensions are deepening.After the fall of the Berlin Wall, as Soviet troops withdrew from Eastern Europe and America began to talk about closing bases in Germany, Europe looked as if it might become the big, peaceful, postmodern federation that European Union architects had long dreamed of: a humanist club where conflicts at home and abroad would be resolved by talking everything to death instead of killing.Then the Balkans blew up and the United States military stepped in to stop a war that Europe seemed incapable of facing. That frustrated Russia, which supported Serbia in the war, but Russia could not offer much help because it was still impotent and staggering from the collapse of its Soviet empire.Now Russia is rich with oil and gas and its military spending is soaring. The rest of Europe — for Moscow increasingly defines itself as European — is wary of stirring up old animosities.“We should be very careful about encouraging the creation of new dividing lines in Europe or the return of an old order,” President Jacques Chirac of France said last month when asked about the American antimissile missile plans.The former Soviet president Mikhail S. Gorbachev put it more succinctly when he told the official Russian news agency, Ria Novosti, last week that “It is all about influence and domination in Europe.”'"
"'07-04-18,'1','The country’s official environmental champion is putting its money where its mouth is.The Environmental Protection Agency has given its procurement staff a list of questions that, as of May 1, they must ask hotels and convention centers that are bidding for E.P.A. business. The questions range from sweeping queries about recycling programs and energy efficiency to specific ones about paperless billing and reused towels. The agency said it would consider the answers when it evaluates bids.“We can use our own purchasing power to influence behavior, and to strengthen the link to our mission of protecting health and the environment,” said Thomas A. O’Connell, an E.P.A. procurement director who led the Green Meetings Work Group that devised the new rule.The E.P.A. spends about $50 million on travel annually, much of it for meeting spaces. The General Services Administration, which sets policy for all government travel, is amending its own rules to suggest that meeting planners throughout the government consult the E.P.A. checklist. That could affect a significant chunk of the $13.5 billion in annual federal spending for travel.E.P.A. will not check on the truthfulness of a hotel’s answers, and travel bookers can still accept bids from hotels that do not pass environmental muster. “But meeting planners usually follow our recommendations,” said Peggy G. DeProspero, travel director for the G.S.A.Many hotels may have little difficulty with the new scrutiny. The Hyatt Regency at Capitol Hill, a frequent meeting place for government agencies, is already certified by Green Seal, which designates companies with leading-edge environmental practices.Marriott International, which has been applauded by E.P.A. for its energy-efficiency programs, said it expected the new rule to drum up business for its 2,300 American hotels.'"
"'07-04-18,'1','TOKYO, April 17 — A group of Japanese researchers on Tuesday publicly challenged Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s denials that Japan’s military coerced women into sexual slavery during World War II, citing reports compiled by Allied investigators immediately after the war.The reports, based partly on interrogations of Japanese prisoners, were originally submitted to the Tokyo war crimes trials, which ended in 1948, as evidence of atrocities by Japan during its wartime expansion across Asia. The reports include accounts of Japanese soldiers and sailors rounding up foreign women for use as sex slaves, euphemistically known here as comfort women.Mr. Abe and other conservatives have repeatedly said there was no evidence that Japan’s military had a direct hand in forcing women into sexual slavery. Many Japanese conservatives have cited the lack of corroborating official documents to dismiss the testimony of former sex slaves, who started coming forward in the 1990s to tell their stories.While the evidence presented Tuesday was not new, the group’s members said they felt obliged to respond to Mr. Abe’s denials. The group’s public rebuttal of Mr. Abe was a rare protest in a country where the prime minister’s remarks had stirred little outcry. The reaction has been much stronger in the rest of Asia, where memories of Japanese aggression remain raw, highlighting Tokyo’s isolation on war history.“It is clear that the comfort women system was a system of sexual slavery,” said a group member, Hirofumi Hayashi, a history professor at Kanto Gakuin University. “However, the movement to openly deny this has grown stronger in the government and elsewhere.”'"
"'07-04-18,'1','LOS ANGELES, April 17 — Olga Garay, former director of the arts program for the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation and currently a consultant to New York arts institutions, has been nominated as general manager of the Los Angeles department of cultural affairs, the city’s top public arts post.Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, who announced the appointment on Monday, said Ms. Garay would oversee the development of a new cultural master plan for the city. Her appointment is subject to confirmation by the Los Angeles City Council.Ms. Garay (pronounced gah-RYE) will succeed Margie Reese, who stepped down last summer.In an interview, Ms. Garay, 54, said that the mayor told her that the city needed to spend more on the department and the arts, while also promoting a diverse array of activities and organizations.“Not enough attention is being paid to how to connect the city’s vital and flourishing hubs of art and culture,” she said. “We have to figure out how to connect the dots, to create a picture for Angelenos of what the city can be.”Though Mr. Villaraigosa made increased arts spending part of his campaign, he has been criticized for not moving quickly enough to fill the position or to promote the city’s artistic communities. Calling Ms. Garay “an internationally recognized dynamo,” he said her task “is to nurture and develop a healthy arts ecosystem, an inclusive community that recognizes and supports an array of cultures, artists, communities and opportunities in the city.”Ms. Garay has never lived on the West Coast. Her family immigrated from Cuba in 1961, when she was a child; she graduated from the University of Florida with a bachelor’s degree in psychology and from Florida International University with a master’s in community psychology.'"
"'07-04-18,'1','Rising energy prices helped push the overall inflation rate last month to the highest rate in nearly a year, but gains excluding food and energy, which the Federal Reserve carefully monitors, slowed.The Labor Department said this morning that the consumer price index rose 0.6 percent in March, the fastest monthly increase since last April. By themselves, energy prices jumped 5.8 percent last month.But core consumer inflation, which does not include food and energy prices, rose just 0.1 percent after climbing 0.2 percent in February. Falling apparel prices, along with slower increases in housing and medical care costs, helped keep core inflation tame.The new inflation numbers came as the government released two other important economic reports today: one on residential home construction, and one on factory production. The other reports offered mixed signals.The news helped send stock prices higher, and the Dow Jones industrial average rose to a record in trading today before pulling back slightly. It closed about 13 points short of the record, at 12,773.04. The Standard and Poor’s 500-stock index, meanwhile, rose just enough to reach 1,471.48, its highest level in six and a half years.According to the Commerce Department, the rate of building permits authorized last month rose 0.8 percent after falling in January and February. And the rate of construction of new homes increased for the second consecutive month, climbing 0.8 percent.'"
"'07-04-18,'1','“We are not anywhere close to the time when we can be thinking about anything but the governor’s health,” said Thomas G. Dallessio, executive director of Leadership New Jersey, a nonprofit organization that trains civic leaders.For some others here, lurking in the back of their minds was a sense of the snakebit nature of state politics in recent years, from the indictments of legislators to the broken bones of governors and even the resignation of James E. McGreevey midway through his term after admitting to an extramarital affair with a male aide.Yet Governor Corzine’s perilous accident, which has left him in critical condition in a Camden hospital, has added a human face and a real sense of mortality.“You had a sense of things getting back to normal with Corzine in there,” said Jeff Tittel, the head of the New Jersey chapter of the Sierra Club, who can regularly be found working the State House hallways. “Now there is a kind of wondering about what will happen next.”Mr. Tittel, along with many others, greeted the news of the governor’s injuries — at first it was thought he suffered only a broken leg — with a lighthearted shrug and a joke that perhaps it was a requirement for the governor of New Jersey. After all, he said, Christie Whitman broke her leg in a skiing accident, and Mr. McGreevey broke his leg on the beach in Cape May.“But as we got more information,” Mr. Tittel said, “it dawned on everybody how serious this was for him, and the shock has been a sort of delayed reaction.”Assemblyman Bill Baroni, a Republican from Mercer County, who recalled his own broken femur 17 years ago, said, “We have to take the coarseness and angst out of the discussion of issues because we are all in this together.”That seemed to be the prevailing feeling among the powerful and the not-so-powerful. Yet there was still room for some other raw feelings more common in the political arena.For instance, Mr. Corzine’s staff was pleased to hear the acting governor, Richard J. Codey, declare at a news conference on Friday that he had no intention of moving into the governor’s office and would perform his duties in his Senate office. But legislators close to the administration said that there was some “outrage” and a sense of betrayal on Monday when Mr. Codey took part in a television interview about the weekend storm from the governor’s office.Where protocol and prerogatives are both the symbol and substance of power, this was no small matter.For his part, Mr. Codey said that he had arranged to be interviewed in his Senate office, but the reporter arrived just as he was finishing a briefing with Mr. Corzine’s staff. So he called the reporter to the governor’s office because that was where he happened to be at the time.He said he had heard second-hand that some of the staff members were upset, and brought it up at a meeting with them Tuesday morning to clear the air.“It is tough for them because Jon is their guy,” Mr. Codey said, “and I understand that, and I am not Jon.”'"
"'07-04-18,'1','IN the last year, two mega-grocery stores have opened in communities that were previously making do without one: Fairway Market in Red Hook, Brooklyn, and Whole Foods Market at the nexus of a few under-grocered downtown neighborhoods: the East Village, the Lower East Side and NoLIta.Both offer dining options to entice shoppers and the stove-phobic. I set off to find out whether these places are just for puzzling over what to do with the shiso cress and pancetta in your cart, or if they are destinations in themselves.The cafe at Fairway in Red Hook has one of the finest outdoor eating spaces in the city, a concrete pier with commanding views of the Statue of Liberty and the choppy waters of New York Harbor.As you wind your way through the labyrinthine space of Fairway’s newest outpost on the way to its cafe, you’ll pass the lobster tanks where, on a recent Sunday, I spied two specimens the size of small pumas.I don’t know if monster lobsters are its secret, but Fairway’s cafe does serve what must be the cheapest lobster roll in the city. It’s not an exemplar of its kind — there are unorthodox additions like red bell pepper and red onion — but the (side-sliced) hot dog roll it is tucked into is dutifully crisped on the griddle. With Terra chips, coleslaw and maybe a little sun, you could do worse for $7.99.'"

It was a particularly sharp decline given that the overall market grew 10.9 percent.“When you were king of the hill for as long as Dell was, it gave room for everyone else to maneuver,” said Loren Loverde, an analyst with IDC, based in Framingham, Mass.IDC said that Hewlett-Packard shipped 28.2 percent more computers in the first quarter worldwide than a year earlier, and held 19.1 percent of the market.

"'07-04-19,'1','There is apparently no clear precedent for this type of prosecution of graffiti vandalism; graffiti charges usually tie a defendant physically to the scene of a defacing. “I know of no case specifically on this point,” said Michael Brovner, the senior assistant district attorney in Queens, where Mr. Maridueña is accused of defacing a subway car parked near a Queens subway station on March 22, 2006, and of leaving a readily visible tag.Mr. Maridueña, 36, has pleaded not guilty to all the charges. He maintained in an interview that he was nowhere near the subway trains or stations that were vandalized, and said he believed he was being singled out because of his professional ties to Marc Ecko, the designer, who has championed graffiti as an art form and has tangled with City Hall over graffiti.Mr. Maridueña said that he had not committed any graffiti vandalism since his daughter was born in 1994, and that the images and tags that prosecutors are now trying to tie to him were the work of copycat graffiti sprayers.“I do consider myself a good friend of Alain’s,” Mr. Ecko said in an e-mail response to questions, adding, “I will consider using my personal resources to fight” the case against Mr. Maridueña.It remains unclear what evidence the district attorneys may have beyond photographs of graffiti. None of the cases have reached the point at which prosecutors must show their evidentiary hand through the discovery process.John O’Mara, an assistant district attorney who is prosecuting Mr. Maridueña in Brooklyn, said, “A tag is not a fingerprint,” and added that he “would not have elected to proceed solely on a tag.” But he said the government could also show that photographs of graffiti on Mr. Maridueña’s computer were entered soon after the vandalism took place.A legal scholar and an expert on graffiti vandalism differed on the strength of the case, based on the limited information that has been disclosed by prosecutors.“It sounds like a strong circumstantial case,” said Carol Steiker, a professor at Harvard Law School. “People are convicted on circumstantial evidence all the time,” she said, citing an example of someone who is convicted of robbery after being found with the victim’s wallet or credit card.But Tim Kephart, a California entrepreneur who uses computer models to analyze graffiti tags for law enforcement authorities, said the case against Mr. Maridueña appeared weak. Mr. Kephart, the chief executive of Graffiti Tracker, said matching a tag to a vandal was crucial, but better evidence would probably be needed to show that Mr. Maridueña was at or near the sites of the recent subway vandalism.Mr. Maridueña’s lawyer, Daniel Perez, said his client spent several nights in jail in March as he was being shuttled between arraignments in Manhattan, Queens and Brooklyn, and was released only after his friends and family provided a cumulative bail of $65,000 required by three judges.“Three district attorneys have ganged up on my client,” Mr. Perez said. “There has got to be something going on.”While insisting that he has not vandalized property for more than a decade, Mr. Maridueña has hardly disappeared from the graffiti scene. According to a biography he has posted online, he has worked as an artistic consultant to companies like Atari, Moët & Chandon and MTV. His strongest business ties have been to Ecko Unlimited, the company run by Mr. Ecko.Mr. Maridueña was hired by Mr. Ecko in 2001 to start Complex, a fashion magazine for young men. He later created graphics for a video game, “Getting Up: Contents Under Pressure,” which was designed by Ecko Unlimited for Atari. Public officials condemned the game because it offered players the virtual equivalent of creating their own graffiti.The release of the game, and a Chelsea block party staged by Mr. Ecko in August 2005 to celebrate it, led to a clash between Mr. Ecko and City Hall. When city officials learned that Ecko Unlimited planned to have 20 young people at the party paint graffiti on metal panels made to look like the sides of subway cars, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said, “Defacing subway cars is not a joke.”Then, after the city revoked the company’s party permit, Mr. Ecko’s lawyers won a court ruling from a federal judge who ordered the permit reinstated and scolded the city for overstepping people’s rights to free speech.In the case against Mr. Maridueña, Mr. Brovner said prosecutors could present a video being marketed on the Internet that shows Mr. Maridueña painting his tag on a subway car. But Carl Weston, the director of Videograf Productions, who said he made the video and has long been an acquaintance of Mr. Maridueña, said the video was made in the early 1990s, long before the cases of graffiti vandalism that Mr. Maridueña is now charged with.Pieces of the prosecutors’ case are included in an affidavit that was submitted by a detective in October to obtain a search warrant for Mr. Maridueña’s apartment.The detective, Jonathan Dubroff of the special investigations unit of the police Transit Bureau, describes graffiti that was sprayed in March 2006 in a Brooklyn subway yard. The affidavit says the tag “KET” was clearly visible in the graffiti, but provides no evidence that Mr. Maridueña was at the yard at the time.The affidavit also provides a short history of how New York City graffiti has evolved, describing a “clean train policy” employed by the subway system since 1989, in which any defaced car is taken out of service and cleaned. As a result, the affidavit says, graffiti vandals began to immediately photograph their work and eventually started circulating the images on the Internet.When the police searched Mr. Maridueña’s apartment on Oct. 12, they removed his computer, which he said held hundreds of graffiti images that had been sent to him, and 3,000 aerosol paint can tops.Mr. Maridueña said the paint was a tool of his art trade and the photographs were being stored for a book about the history of New York City graffiti.“I am a photographer, a sometimes commercial painter and a historian who is totally a fan of the art movement,” he said. “I’m just a geek, but they are trying to fry me.”'"
"'07-04-19,'1','“Companies doing business in China are forced to comply with Chinese law,” said Jim Cullinan, a Yahoo spokesman. When government officials present the company with a lawful request for information about a Yahoo user, he said, “Yahoo China will not know whether the demand for information is for a legitimate criminal investigation or is going to be used to prosecute political dissidents.”Several American Internet companies, including Cisco Systems, Google and Microsoft, have come under fire, with some politicians and human rights groups accusing them of helping the government monitor and censor the Internet in China.But Yahoo has come under particularly sharp criticism. Human rights groups say that Yahoo has helped identify at least four people, including the journalist Shi Tao in 2004, who have since been imprisoned for voicing dissent in cyberspace.“Our concern is that Yahoo, as far as we know, is continuing this practice,” said Morton Sklar, executive director of the World Organization for Human Rights USA and a lawyer for the plaintiffs.According to the suit, Mr. Wang distributed online several journal articles calling for democratic reform and a multiparty system in China. He did so anonymously by posting the articles in a Yahoo Group in 2000 and 2001. The suit contends that Yahoo HK, a wholly owned Yahoo subsidiary based in Hong Kong, provided police with information linking Mr. Wang to the postings.Mr. Cullinan of Yahoo disputed those claims. “Yahoo HK does not exchange info with Yahoo China or give information to mainland Chinese security forces,” he said. Yahoo transferred its mainland China operations to Alibaba.com in 2005, and owns a minority stake in that company, which is based in China.On Sept. 1, 2002, Mr. Wang was arrested by Chinese authorities, according to the suit, which says he was later kicked and beaten and was detained until September 2003, when he was sentenced to 10 years.The suit says that the Chinese court’s judgment noted that Yahoo HK told investigators that the e-mail account used to disseminate the postings belonged to Mr. Wang.The Alien Tort Claims Act, enacted in 1789, lets foreigners sue in American courts for fundamental violations of international law, like torture and genocide. It has been used in recent years to sue people who have violated basic human rights.But legal specialists say that Mr. Wang and Ms. Yu face significant hurdles.Allen S. Weiner, a professor of international law at Stanford, said it was unclear whether the law would apply to a company like Yahoo, which is only accused of having contributed indirectly to Mr. Wang’s predicament. Further, Professor Weiner said that Yahoo might be excused by courts by virtue of its obligation to comply with Chinese law.The Torture Victims Protection Act, which was enacted in 1991, allows plaintiffs, including foreign citizens, to file civil suits in the United States. Under either law, the plaintiffs would have to prove that Mr. Wang was subject to torture, Professor Weiner said.“The plaintiffs in this case have a lot of barriers to overcome,” he said.SAN FRANCISCO, April 18 (Reuters) — A federal judge refused on Wednesday to dismiss a lawsuit contending that Google’s AdWords program abuses trademarks.Judge Jeremy D. Fogel ruled that the public had an interest in whether AdWords, the company’s popular pay-per-click advertising system, violated trademark law.American Blind and Wallpaper Factory, the top American retailer of window blinds, charged that Google had abused trademarks by allowing rivals of a company to buy ads that appear when users search the Web for information on its business.'"
"'07-04-19,'1','Modern diesel technology, already widespread in Europe, is slowly making its way to the United States. The new engines are a far cry from the coughing, stinking diesel engines of the past, and have lower greenhouse gas emissions and better fuel economy than gasoline engines.DaimlerChrysler offers a new-era diesel engine in the Mercedes E-Class, and has plans to start selling a diesel Grand Cherokee this year.General Motors, Honda, Audi, Volkswagen and BMW have plans sell diesel engines that meet federal guidelines in the future.But diesel engines have been less popular in Japan. Mr. Ghosn said on Wednesday that Nissan plans to sell the new diesel vehicles in Japan and China by 2010.Nissan has not said what percentage of its Maxima fleet in the United States or abroad would have diesel engines.Daniel F. Becker, director of the Sierra Club’s global warming program, said the new engine would allow Nissan to make up for some of its past environmental missteps.“There are a number of categories in which Nissan is sort of a laggard among the Japanese leaders,” he said. “It’s good news that Nissan is trying to find ways to improve its environmental performance. If they follow the lead of Honda and Toyota, it can bring much cleaner, more fuel-efficient vehicles to market and make more money doing it.”With its sales and overall performance in a slump, Nissan is taking a hard look at what does, and does not, sell. “Consumers want environmentally friendly cars,” Mr. Ghosn said. “They want to have the pleasure of driving without the guilt.”Later, in answer to questions from reporters, Mr. Ghosn made it clear that the company would not buy Chrysler from DaimlerChrysler, which is looking at spinning off the money-losing division. “Some people are a little worried about Nissan,” he said. “So you don’t want to engage in anything like this.”He declined to address why the merger of Chrysler and Daimler-Benz did not seem to be working. Mr. Ghosn has faced questions himself about whether the alliance of Nissan and the French carmaker Renault is a failure.“If you want to know the reality, you have to be inside,” he said, adding that even from the inside, it is not always easy to tell why the business is stumbling. “The execution of alliances is something that’s extremely delicate.”Mr. Ghosn also offered his thoughts on the troubles in the American auto industry, which he said are probably cyclical.“We are used to hitting bumps and reflecting on them,” he said. “Hitting bumps is normal in our industry.” He added: “The mistake is to say, ‘Don’t worry. There’s no problem.’ ”'"

"'07-04-19,'1','Mr. Ayala said that the program also would be offered to low-income communities in the developed nations, including the United States — those families with incomes in the bottom 15 percent of the population, about $15,000 a year for an average household .Under the program, Microsoft would make its discounted software available for installation on computers that would typically be sold to national, state or local governments, which would then distribute the PCs to individuals.The price of the machines, Microsoft said, would depend on PC makers and what hardware features were included. Industry analysts said basic machines with the $3 Microsoft bundle of programs could be priced at $300 or less. The standard retail price of the software in the $3 bundle, including Windows XP Starter Edition and Office Home and Office 2007, would be about $150.There are about a billion PC users worldwide, mainly in developed nations. The initial goal of the Microsoft program, working with many industry partners, would be to add another billion PC users by 2015, Mr. Ayala said.The new Microsoft program is aimed directly at students, through national and local governments that buy Windows PCs for schoolchildren, both for schoolwork and for their personal use at home. For the last five years, Microsoft’s outreach to developing countries has focused on schools and training teachers as well as students through a program called Partners in Learning.Software piracy is another pressing concern for Microsoft and other software companies in developing nations. Mr. Ayala acknowledged that piracy and the competition from Linux were business issues for Microsoft.“But this isn’t really about responding to those things, but about finding an economically practical way to put good software and a good computer into these people’s hands and get them going in life,” Mr. Ayala said.“Certainly,” he added, “for Microsoft this is an investment in the long term. These are the consumers of the future.”No matter what happens with Microsoft’s effort in developing countries, it is not going to have much impact on the company’s financial performance anytime soon. Its annual sales are running at more than $45 billion a year.“Microsoft is betting that at least some of the kids from developing nations will turn into buyers of more mainstream products later in life,” said Roger L. Kay, president of Endpoint Technologies Associates, a research firm. “The theory is that if you get them young, you can keep them for life.”Microsoft has additional steps planned beyond the discounted software. For example, the company said that it would add 200 Microsoft Innovation Centers in 25 countries in the next two years. These centers — Microsoft already has 110 in 60 nations — train local people in software development and provide assistance in starting businesses.Economic development experts have long debated whether scarce resources in poorer nations should be spent on computers, when there may be more pressing needs like training teachers, building schools and buying books. Programs like Microsoft’s and One Laptop per Child are not giveaways.“I haven’t seen any evidence that the digital divide is more acute or more consequential than say the nutritional divide, the elementary education divide or the basic health care divide,” said Aaditya Mattoo, an economist at the World Bank.Still, as the price of technology continues to fall and its impact spreads, there is a recognition that access to computers and technology skills can be an important ingredient in development.Today Microsoft is announcing an alliance with the Asian Development Bank to support local technology entrepreneurs, use technology in teaching and learning and promote local research programs.“Information communications technology holds significant promise for poverty reduction,” said Larry Greenwood, a vice president at the bank.'"
"'07-04-19,'1','HARTFORD, April 18 (AP) — The United Technologies Corporation, aided by double-digit growth at Otis elevator and a comeback by Sikorsky Aircraft after a strike last year, reported almost a 7 percent increase in first-quarter profit on Wednesday.Income rose to $819 million, from $768 million in the period a year ago. Earnings of 82 cents a share were up from 76 cents in the first quarter of 2006, beating forecasts of 80 cents by analysts, according to a Thomson Financial poll.Revenue in the first quarter increased 16 percent, to $12.3 billion, from $10.6 billion a year earlier. United Technologies makes jet engines, elevators and security systems.“It’s a solid start to the year,” an analyst at Edward Jones, Matt Collins, said. “They’re still delivering impressive growth.”Operating profit at Otis rose more than 30 percent, to $574 million, in the quarter, from $439 million in the period in 2006.'"
"'07-04-19,'1','Democrats said they were merely trying to untie the hands of the secretary of health and human services so he could negotiate on behalf of 43 million Medicare beneficiaries.“The Department of Veterans Affairs is able to negotiate for lower-priced drugs,” said the Senate majority leader, Harry Reid, Democrat of Nevada. “H.M.O.’s can negotiate. Wal-Mart can negotiate. Why in the world shouldn’t Medicare be able to do that?”A 2003 law prohibits Medicare from negotiating or setting drug prices or establishing a uniform list of covered drugs, or formulary.Mr. Reid said Democrats fell short because of “the power of the insurance industry and the pharmaceutical industry,” which spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on lobbying and advertisements against the bill.The vote also reflected ineffectual advocacy by Democrats, who were slow in responding to the vehement arguments of well-prepared Republican senators like Charles E. Grassley of Iowa.“Private competition works,” said Mr. Grassley, a principal author of the 2003 law. “The Department of Health and Human Services has had very little experience and a dismal track record” figuring out what to pay for drugs.Big companies that offer the Medicare drug benefit, like Caremark and Medco Health Solutions, “have more market power than Medicare” because they negotiate for tens of millions of people in private plans, as well as for Medicare recipients, Mr. Grassley said.Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, said he did not want the government to supplant private plans. But, Mr. Wyden said, Medicare could negotiate better bargains on selected drugs that have no therapeutic equivalents or competition.The House passed a bill requiring the secretary of health and human services to negotiate drug prices by a vote of 255 to 170 on Jan. 12, eight days after Congress convened. The Senate bill permits but does not require negotiations.President Bush had threatened to veto both versions. AARP, the lobby for older Americans, supported both.The Republican senators who joined Democrats in voting to take up the bill on negotiating prices were Norm Coleman of Minnesota, Susan Collins of Maine, Chuck Hagel of Nebraska, Gordon H. Smith of Oregon, Olympia J. Snowe of Maine and Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania.Two candidates for the Republican presidential nomination, Senators Sam Brownback of Kansas and John McCain of Arizona, were not present.An aide to Mr. McCain said he was campaigning in South Carolina and would have voted with the Democrats. An aide to Mr. Brownback said he would have sided with most Republican senators.In creating the benefit in 2003, Congress made a radical departure from traditional Medicare, which has uniform benefits defined by law. Medicare recipients in every state have a choice of prescription drugs plans with different benefits, premiums, co-payments and deductibles. The 2003 law prohibited the government from interfering in negotiations between drug manufacturers and companies that provide the benefit. The House and Senate bills would repeal that ban.Employers and health plans typically obtain discounts on particular drugs in return for encouraging patients to use those medicines, rather than competing products.The Congressional Budget Office said that the Senate bill, like the House measure, “would have a negligible effect on federal spending.”“Without the authority to establish a formulary or other tools to reduce drug prices, we believe that the secretary would not obtain significant discounts from drug manufacturers across a broad range of drugs,” the budget office said.Some Republicans prepared to filibuster the Senate bill, but that proved unnecessary. Their whip, Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi, said Republicans had blocked consideration of the bill because they did not want to dicker with Democrats over amendments on unrelated topics, “with no happy end in sight.”Mr. Wyden predicted that the Senate would vote again on the issue, perhaps as an amendment to a spending bill or other measure. “The fight will go on,” he said.Senator Amy Klobuchar, a freshman Democrat from Minnesota, said the vote showed that “the power of big pharma,” the pharmaceutical industry, “is still a presence in the halls of Congress.”'"
"'07-04-19,'1','This change will affect the price of off-peak round-trip tickets on 16 morning trains. Riders who buy monthly passes will not be affected by this change. Three of the 16 trains are on the Northeast Corridor line.About 5,000 riders a day take the 16 affected trains. In a worst-case situation for New Jersey Transit, it might lose $300,000 in revenue if many riders switch to earlier trains.New Jersey Transit also said that it would appoint a customer advocate to better address rider concerns. The agency is also working with the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey and the city of Newark to consider how to improve service to and from Newark Liberty International Airport, as well as pricing to the airport from New York City.“We do everything we can to avoid a fare increase; it’s our last resort,” said Richard R. Sarles, the executive director of New Jersey Transit who this month succeeded George D. Warrington, who retired.“But in terms of dealing with specific suggestions from customers,” Mr. Sarles added, “these were the ones we could do immediately.”New Jersey Transit expects to receive about $300 million in state aid the coming fiscal year, which Mr. Sarles said he appreciated given New Jersey’s budget woes. The money, however, goes only part of the way toward paying for the record number of riders on New Jersey Transit, he said.Each weekday, New Jersey Transit currently handles 857,000 riders, its most ever, on its buses, trains and light-rail lines. Total ridership in the second quarter of this fiscal year, October-December 2006, jumped by 5.9 percent compared with the same quarter a year earlier. Ridership in the 2005 and 2006 fiscal years also hit record highs.Still, rider advocates say that public transit commuters are being unfairly treated at the expense of drivers in the state. New Jersey Transit has raised fares five times since the state last raised the gas tax in 1988. They also question how seriously officials at New Jersey Transit considered suggestions from riders, given that the proposed fare increases were almost unchanged from the original proposal.“There is really nowhere else where senior management is as accessible as they are here,” said David Peter Alan, chairman of the Lackawanna Coalition, a rider advocacy group. “But when it comes down to it, we’re irrelevant.”The fare increase, he said, “was a done deal.”'"

"'07-04-19,'1','“Most people show up thinking it’s easy,” said Jack Comstock, the vice president for television sales at QVC. In his 14 years at the network, he has hired 18 of its 23 hosts. “But it’s difficult to find someone that can really talk to the camera as if it was their friend.”Rare is the Hollywood movie, network television program or Broadway show that casts its stars from an open call. But QVC, a $7 billion annual business, where hosts can have television careers that span decades, does. The nominal stars of QVC are the budget clothing and jewelry designers who offer their creations, inventors touting new housewares and faded celebrities with exercise programs. But on a network that can move tens of thousands of dollars of merchandise a minute, the host plays a crucial role: part cheerleader for a celebrity guest, part M.C. executing the orders of producers to end a slow-selling item’s airtime gracefully, part fantasy friend to viewers, coaxing them to call.It’s a rare skill set, and industry sources say the network is willing to compensate hosts for it extremely well, up to $500,000 a year.Among the hopefuls who lined up outside QVC’s corporate headquarters before 6:15 a.m. last Friday was Mark Werden, a former singer and dancer with the self-empowerment performance group Up With People. The candidates had been told to bring an object they would pretend to sell during their two-minute auditions. Mr. Werden, wearing a bright pink sweater, carried an aluminum frying pan his mother gave him when he left for college.“This frying pan comes with love,” he said, beginning his audition in a cramped room with three QVC employees looking on from behind a videocamera. Tapes from promising candidates would be shown to higher-ups, and around 35 would be called back for the next round. The company intends to hire two to four hosts this year, said Michael George, its president and chief executive.Afterward, Mr. Werden, 42, said he was hoping for a career change from being a private guidance counselor. Why the old frying pan?“It’s pretty easy to sell something if you believe in it,” he said.Professional hosts must move merchandise even if they don’t believe in it. As the hopefuls auditioned, Leah Williams, a host who joined QVC in 1996, performed live in the spacious studio at the back of the building, playing a gracious sidekick to an accessories designer, Kathy Van Zeeland, who was offering an imitation leather handbag. After Ms. Van Zeeland flipped the bag open and said the exterior fabric had a “leather hand” (meaning it feels like leather), Ms. Williams said that what appealed to her was the tiny makeup mirror on the inside of the top flap.“Love it,” the host said, sweeping her gaze from bag to camera. “Love,” she repeated. She paused long enough for the word that can mean so much, and so little, to inhabit its own full measure of airtime. Finally, she completed her thought with another word spoken as if it deserved its own sentence: “It.”A lot of drama for a $37.12 handbag and only a few seconds in a three-hour shift on camera.“For me,” said Sandra Bennett, a host who was hired after last year’s open call, “the hardest challenge is staying perky for three hours.”Ms. Bennett, 36, a former television news anchor in Harrisburg, impressed her auditioners so much that they ushered her into Mr. Comstock’s office that very day. She soon signed a contract and began the rigorous six-month training program and trial period for new hosts. Now she typically arrives at QVC at 11 p.m. to prepare and appears on the air at 3 a.m.QVC officials would not say how much hosts are paid, but Kerry McNally, a former host on rival HSN who is now on the ShopNBC network, said they can make half a million dollars or more annually.And a kind of celebrity comes with the job. Mary Beth Roe, a former Minnesota beauty queen, who has been a QVC host for 17 years, said that fans often want to hug her. “Viewers are very sweet,” she said.While QVC, which employs 16,900 people worldwide (there are channels in England, Germany and Japan), is a major economic engine for West Chester, some residents say a few of the hosts have developed swollen egos.“There’s some of them who host shows who think they’re movie stars,” said Allan Hofmann, the general manager of Transplant Transmissions, a repair shop in this college town, the home of West Chester University, founded in 1871. “They talk down to people. When they’re in the stores, they act like they shouldn’t have to pay for stuff. ‘Do you know who I am?’ they ask.”Online discussion boards like those at tvtalkshows.com chronicle every hairstyle change and facial wrinkle of some hosts. One thread on a discussion board about Ms. Bennett is titled “Sandra is superhot, but lacks pizazz.” Another remarks on her “sexy feet.”Ms. Bennett said she has stopped reading about herself. “I’d rather my feedback come from my producers than whether someone online likes my hair or not,” she said.Being the subject of celebrity gossip is a problem plenty of people might like, judging by the eagerness of would-be hosts. Sporting a furry beard and metal-rim glasses, and with a soft midsection, Eddie Deutch, a salesman at an Apple computer store in King of Prussia, showed up with a laptop to “sell” at his audition.Mr. Deutch, 53, spoke easily to the camera during his two minutes. Was he telegenic enough for QVC? He did not have the baby blue eyes of Rick Domeier, who appeared in his pre-host days on the soap opera “The Young and the Restless” and in the movie “Evil Dead II.”Appearance did not seem to concern Mr. Deutch, who maintained: “Viewers don’t care if it’s coming from a model or someone who can just talk clearly to them. Talking about tech is something I’m good at.” He went away hopeful.Although QVC is more than twice the size of HSN, its nearest competitor, Mr. George, the QVC president, keeps watch on his rivals. He has seven televisions on in his office, some tuned to ShopNBC, Jewelry Television and HSN.How does he compare his network with the others? “What makes us unique in the world of televised retailing,” he said, “is we were founded on the basic notion that this is a new nascent industry of TV shopping that is filled with hype and schlock, and we’re going to be the opposite of that, the quality, value, convenience network.”Executives at HSN, formerly the Home Shopping Network, did not seem to dispute that assessment. Andy Sheldon, who was named the senior vice president for television at HSN five months ago, said by phone he hopes to class up its image, in part by toning down the on-the-air talent’s heavy eye makeup and “big hair.” He is flying his hosts to New York to have them styled by Oscar Blandi at his salon.“If a host starts putting on weight, then I will absolutely say something to them,” Mr. Sheldon said from his company’s headquarters in St. Petersburg, Fla.As Ms. Seegers, the bank employee, auditioned, her blond hair was perfectly in place and her voice was calm as she made her points, including remembering the correct item number, H98618, for the sugared Easter wreath she was selling. (It had already appeared on QVC.) The fabric on the wrists of her black blazer vibrated slightly, apparently betraying her nerves.Even television pros can falter under audition pressure. Shelley Crenshaw, a former television news reporter at stations in the Seattle area, who has been out of work for about a year, was also hoping to be hired. Wearing a low-cut purple shirt, she spoke clearly, but her performance did not wow Mr. Comstock, who said later he would probably invite her back for a second audition, based only on her résumé. “My advice to Shelley would be calm down, be yourself,” he said.Ms. Crenshaw said she would not be ashamed at moving from the world of television journalism to home shopping, but while waiting to hear from QVC, she’s spending her time watching CNN.“For example, that stuff with the shootings in Virginia and Imus,” she said, “I’ve been glued to the TV. I still like to know what’s going on in the world.”'"
"'07-04-19,'1','THEY were reverent about the music — ’70s and ’80s chart toppers like “Rich Girl,” “Maneater” and “Out of Touch.” But the rockers performing Hall & Oates’s greatest hits at the Loser’s Lounge at Joe’s Pub in Manhattan Saturday night were not so pious in their garb.Jeff La Greca a camped-up ringer for John Oates, his idol, raked his fingers though his copious curls. “This is yak hair,” he said deadpan, “protein-fed and from the Himalayas.” His moustache, he added, was pure chimpanzee, culled and combed from the monkey’s nether regions. “For a Hall & Oates tribute, only the finest will do.”Others wore their vintage weeds like talismans, showing off raucous plaid flares, baby-doll frocks and a crazy assortment of headbands and shades. Steve Welsh (in stripes, bottom center) accessorized with a banged-up sax, while Anney Fresh mugged beneath a platinum wig. Her look was “lounge zombie,” she said, capped by that beehive. “It’s my magic hairdo. I can’t sing without it.”'"
"'07-04-19,'1','David Torn is a guitarist, composer and producer, though the word order may depend on whom you consult. His career, stretching back more than 30 years, could easily be the work of several different people. He has carved a niche at the extreme end of guitar culture, while working extensively (and successfully) in film and commercial music. To call him a hero of the electric avant-garde would be accurate but incomplete.On Tuesday night Mr. Torn made a relatively rare appearance at Joe’s Pub in celebration of “Prezens,” his new album on ECM. The show was sold out, and the house was suitably well stocked with guitarists. The stage was well stocked too, with an intimidating assemblage of amplifiers, electronics and what looked like a dozen effects pedals. At first glance it seemed clear which of Mr. Torn’s identities would take center stage.Performing with Mr. Torn were the alto saxophonist Tim Berne, the keyboardist Craig Taborn and the drummer Tom Rainey; in another context they have a collective identity as Hard Cell, working mainly with the corkscrew compositions of Mr. Berne. But at Joe’s Pub, as on “Prezens,” they submitted to Mr. Torn’s sonic designs, which evolved, or perhaps just mutated, over the course of an hourlong group improvisation.Disruption served as a compositional device throughout the set, which began with a rhythmic repetition by Mr. Taborn and some clucking sounds by Mr. Berne. Out of nowhere a broken beat exploded into being: Mr. Rainey’s entrance. Then the beat halted, just as abruptly. Into the expectant quiet Mr. Berne played a six-note saxophone pattern, which Mr. Torn electronically sampled, setting up a jagged funk groove.Mr. Torn generated a precise scrum of feedback and oceanic noise, making expressive use of the tremolo arm on his guitar. When Mr. Taborn insinuated a new underlying pulse with his Fender Rhodes piano — a slow-burn vamp in 14/8 meter — Mr. Torn shifted more toward static. With one hand tweaking knobs on a console and one foot glued to a pedal, he seemed like a hybrid: the guitarist-as-producer, with the instrument serving as an interface.“Prezens,” Mr. Torn’s first ECM album since “Cloud About Mercury” about 20 years ago, proposes a more radical mediation. Though it began as a series of free improvisations, Mr. Torn filtered and fractured the results, producing an ambitious compositional collage.'"

"'07-04-21,'0','Pfizer, the world’s largest drug maker, said yesterday that its profit fell 17.5 percent in the first quarter, hurt by one-time charges and disappointing sales of its diabetes drug Exubera.Net income fell to $3.39 billion, or 48 cents a share, from $4.11 billion, or 56 cents a share, a year earlier. The most recent quarter included restructuring costs of $812 million, up from $299 million a year earlier, partly as a result of the company’s plan to cut its work force by 10 percent.Revenue rose 6 percent, to $12.47 billion, from $11.75 billion last year.Excluding one-time items, the company reported adjusted profit of $4.8 billion, or 68 cents a share, up from $4.35 billion, or 59 cents a share.First-quarter results were well above Wall Street’s expectations. Analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial expected earnings per share, excluding charges and gains, of 57 cents a share on revenue of $11.77 billion.Sales of the company’s best selling drug, the cholesterol reducer Lipitor, grew 8 percent to $3.36 billion, topping most Wall Street estimates. Price increases, fewer rebates and favorable foreign-exchange rates made up for a decline in Lipitor prescriptions in the United States, where competition from cheaper, generic cholesterol drugs has increased.Sales of the inhalable insulin Exubera were “disappointing,” the company said, not specifying dollar amounts.The company seeks to develop the market for Exubera more in the second half of the year.As expected, Pfizer reduced full-year revenue estimates to reflect the early loss of patent exclusivity for Pfizer’s second-best-selling drug, the blood pressure medication Norvasc.'"
"'07-04-21,'0','A failure to approve the four trade deals — with Colombia, Panama, Peru and South Korea — could end the possibility of trade negotiations for the rest of Mr. Bush’s term and deal a blow to any chances of a global trade accord.Without an agreement in the Democratic-led Congress on the president’s so-called fast-track negotiating authority, which expires June 30, the administration would not be able to bring any global trade deal before lawmakers and get an up-or-down vote.Trade negotiations among 180 countries have been foundering since last summer, but the United States has joined with Europe, India and Brazil to try to revive them. More talks are expected next week in Washington, but trade officials said that the impasse between the Democrats and the administration on labor rights has clouded their chances.At issue is the Democratic demand that pending trade deals with Colombia, Panama, Peru and South Korea include a provision guaranteeing certain rights for labor in the trading partner countries, including a ban on child and slave labor and the right to organize.In addition, the Democrats want the accords to endorse general labor protections adopted by the International Labor Organization, like the right to organize.The Bush administration, backed by business groups, contends that this Democratic demand could lead to trading partners suing to overturn basic American labor practices, like teenage summer jobs or work on farms, or the practice in some American states of prisoners making consumer goods.Another fear is that governments in Latin America, perhaps inspired by anti-American figures like President Hugo Chávez of Venezuela, might use trade deals to try to overturn “right to work” laws in states, which bar employers from requiring workers to join unions.“Subjecting our labor system to foreign challenge is simply not something to which we can agree,” said John Engler, a former Republican governor of Michigan who is president of the National Association of Manufacturers.“For state constitutions or laws to be subject to a foreign nation’s challenge would be unacceptable,” Mr. Engler said.The United States Chamber of Commerce sided with Mr. Engler but suggested that there was still a possibility of compromise.Mr. Rangel and other Democrats said that the concern of Mr. Engler and other business leaders was bogus, noting that under the Democratic proposal only those laws that have an impact on trade might be challenged.He added that he was “astounded” that Mr. Engler would “go to such lengths to jeopardize the hard work of so many in Congress and the administration who are negotiating these issues.”Republicans in Congress have tried to stay out of the fight between Mr. Rangel and the business groups. Both Representative Jim McCrery, a Louisiana Republican who is the ranking Republican member of House Ways and Means, and Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, ranking Republican of the Senate Finance Committee, have said they were convinced that a compromise could be reached if the attacks stop.Administration officials have not spoken about Mr. Rangel’s dispute with the National Association of Manufacturers, other than to say that they agree with the business groups.Organized labor sides with the Democrats, but officials at the A.F.L.-C.I.O. say that while the Republican fear of an effort to change American labor laws is far-fetched, there would be an advantage to the International Labor Organization putting pressure on the United States to change some laws.“At the end of the day, no American change in U.S. labor laws is going to come through a bilateral trade agreement with Peru,” said Thea Lee, chief international economist of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. “But putting these provisions into a bilateral agreement does put additional pressure on the United States government.”Ms. Lee and others noted that past trade agreements, like one with Jordan signed at the end of the Clinton administration and approved during President Bush’s first year in office, had labor provisions that are similar to the ones the Democrats are seeking.Representative Sander Levin, a Michigan Democrat who is chairman of the Ways and Means trade subcommittee, said the administration’s concern was “a false issue” because only governments could bring challenges to American labor laws.Meanwhile, Mr. Levin said the Democrats were still pressing for environmental protections and other issue to be put in the trade deals before Congress.“I think some in the administration doubt that Democrats are united on this,” he said. “We believe that putting worker rights in to trade agreements is a critical piece of shaping globalization in the world today.”'"
"'07-04-21,'0','Any foreigner in the old Soviet Union knew to search for decent food at the immigrants’ stalls of the nearest farmers’ market. The offerings sold in state stores often looked faintly gray, suffering from age or freezer burn. By contrast, the markets like Cheryomushski, near our apartment in Moscow, were full of color and life and fresh vegetables. People from the Caucasus were there, laughing and bargaining and, undoubtedly, making fun of bumbling customers like me. In midwinter, they sold exquisite lemons or fresh cilantro, hand-carried from the south, oranges in artful pyramids and brown eggs, some with tiny feathers still attached. And the butcher carved the meat before your eyes. With an ax.Now the Russian government has decided that immigrants, even legal ones, no longer belong in the nation’s 5,200 markets. Since April 1, only Russian citizens have been allowed to sell spices or vegetables. In only a few weeks, the markets have been drained of their full-bodied flavors, and many stalls are empty.The idea, President Vladimir Putin said last year, is that barring immigrants will “ease tension on the labor market and make it more civilized.” In reality, this dreadful law exhibits the worst of Russian instincts. This nationalism, this visceral fear and dislike of non-Russians, is a destructive force for the immigrants and a self-destructive force for the Russians.As one Uzbek told the Times reporter Andrew E. Kramer, “In the street there is hate for immigrants.” SOVA, the anti-hate-crime organization in Russia, has estimated that so far this year, 23 immigrants have died and 149 have been wounded in what it terms ethnically motivated attacks. Since April 1, the police have raided the markets with buses to round up people and send them back to former Soviet states like Azerbaijan or Uzbekistan or Georgia. Notices on market doors advertise space now for “farmers from the Fatherland.”Such xenophobia should horrify anyone with a grounding in Russian and German history. But for Russia to ban immigrants from Georgia is much like banning Georgian wine, another government mistake that makes Russians go without some of the best wines in the region. This sprawling nation, which is losing population, needs to find a way to welcome ambitious newcomers instead of excluding them. Russia’s fate, like its empty market stalls, will grow insular and gray unless Russia brings in these vibrant people and their exotic wares.'"
"'07-04-21,'0','In recent days, Mr. Corzine, 60, who fractured his breastbone, shattered his left femur and broke 11 ribs, his right collarbone and a lower vertebra, had been taking more breaths on his own; by Wednesday, doctors said he had been taking six breaths on his own for every eight supplied by the machine. Doctors had put him on the ventilator to alleviate the pain caused by breathing.Despite the removal of the breathing machine, a handful of veteran trauma physicians and orthopedic surgeons interviewed on Friday said the governor was entering a phase of recovery that was riddled with potential hazards common to those who have sustained similar injuries.The doctors, none of whom have treated Mr. Corzine or seen his medical records, did not offer an assessment on his prognosis, but described the outlook for patients who have sustained similar injuries.“He’s a fairly fortunate fellow, given the constellation of the thoracic injuries and the femur fracture,” said Dr. Thomas A. Santora, a surgeon at Temple University Hospital in Philadelphia. “It’s a major cluster of injuries.”Dr. David H. Livingston, the chief of the trauma division at University Hospital in Newark, said research showed that of a group of 100 men 60 years of age or older, as many as a third would have died of the kinds of injuries the governor sustained.Dr. Livingston said that a scoring system called the injury severity scale offered an indication of the seriousness of Mr. Corzine’s injuries when he arrived at the hospital by helicopter after the crash, just outside Atlantic City. He said that on the scale, ranging from 0 to 75, with the highest number representing a lethal injury, the governor’s injuries probably ranked 33 or 34.“That is huge,” Dr. Livingston said. “If you’re over 9, you should be in a trauma center.”Among the potential recovery hazards the doctors cited are blood clots and pneumonia. In addition, there is a risk of infection from fluid that builds up in the body when it is largely immobilized for extended periods.So far, the governor’s doctors have not indicated what, if any, complications Mr. Corzine has encountered. And the doctors interviewed said that Cooper University Hospital — a nationally respected trauma center and one of the top three such facilities in New Jersey — was undoubtedly taking precautions to prevent such problems.Blood thinners, for example, can be administered to prevent clots, they said, and patients can be placed in special hydraulic beds that shift weight and maneuver parts of the body to keep fluids from pooling and inviting infections.The governor’s doctors, citing privacy concerns, have declined to describe in much detail the governor’s treatment, but they have said that besides a feeding tube, four other tubes have been employed — two to drain fluids and two to provide medicine.The governor’s aides have said that tests so far show no signs of injury to his brain or spinal cord. Doctors say it is encouraging that he has continued to communicate — through nods and other gestures — even though he has been only semiconscious.Even without knowing the details of his condition, the doctors who were interviewed remarked that despite the extent and seriousness of his injuries, the governor was doing as well as could be expected.Patients in Mr. Corzine’s situation face the greatest risk of death at three crucial periods after an accident like his, said Dr. Jeffrey S. Hammond, the director of the trauma center at Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital in New Brunswick, N.J., and the governor has already survived two of them: the initial accident, and the days immediately afterward.The third critical period is five to seven days after the accident, Dr. Hammond said, when there is a risk of organ failure from infection.Dr. Ken Rodriguez, chief of orthopedic trauma at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, an affiliate of the Harvard Medical School, said there were several milestones after patients are removed from ventilators.When patients are well enough to leave intensive care, they are transferred to traditional rooms. Once they are discharged from the hospital, Dr. Rodriguez said, they often go directly to a physical therapy center for stays that can last from a few weeks to a few months.In cases like Mr. Corzine’s, more rehabilitation is then required, Dr. Rodriguez said, noting that patients who have sustained such devastating injuries are often unable to return to normal activity for as long as a year.Initially, the governor’s aides said that he might be able to return to work at the State House within a week or two of the accident.“That is very unlikely,” Dr. Rodriguez said. “If it was just the femur fracture, then the period of maximum medical recovery is a year.”'"
"'07-04-21,'0','“For 30 years, Xerox raised prices so it wouldn’t have to worry about costs,” noted Ulysses S. Yannas, a broker at Buckman, Buckman & Reid. “Now it is doing the opposite.”The new approach is working. According to Infotrends, a research firm, Xerox accounts for half of the pages produced on high-speed digital color presses.Black and white printing is not doing nearly as well, but analysts note that color printing offers about five times the profit of monochrome for Xerox.“Xerox really has a strong, wide portfolio, and they’ve put in place the engines to drive top-line growth,” said Angèle Boyd, a vice president of the research firm IDC.Xerox’s quarterly numbers reflect the favorable skew. Revenue for the first three months of 2007 was $3.8 billion, up 4 percent from last year. About 70 percent came from supplies and services.Xerox earned $233 million, a 17 percent rise from the comparable quarter in 2006. That came out to 24 cents a share, which beat analysts’ estimates by 4 cents.Costs are down, and will soon go down more — Xerox is leaving its lush headquarters in Stamford, Conn., for sparser space in Norwalk.Xerox said it would earn $1.12 to $1.16 a share for the year — and expected it would be closer to the high end.Still, some investors remain concerned that Xerox has not proved that it can deliver brisk growth.“The good quarter was driven by the cost structure, and we aren’t convinced that the revenue situation has been resolved,” said Jack L. Kelly, an analyst with Goldman Sachs.Neither is Timothy M. Ghriskey, chief investment officer at Solaris Asset Management. Mr. Ghriskey agrees with all of Ms. Mulcahy’s strategies — but he is not buying Xerox shares. “The competition Xerox is facing for sales is just formidable,” he said.Indeed it is. Xerox remains the dominant player in the market for high-speed printers, for example, but others are nipping at its heels. “Xerox has been in the lead, but Kodak and Canon and Ricoh have been coming up fast,” said Patricia Sorce, co-director of the Printing Industry Center at the Rochester Institute of Technology.So has the Dutch company Oce. This week, Oce introduced a high-speed continuous feed printer — the paper goes through on rolls rather than cut sheets — that it plans to market to book publishers.And last year it introduced a high-speed cut-sheet machine that can simultaneously print on both sides of a sheet.Jan Hull, an Oce senior vice president, insisted that Oce is “already ahead of plan” to grab at least a 20 percent share of the high-speed market in the next four to five years.Ricoh, meanwhile, already commands a large share of the market for office printers, and has new high-speed printers coming out next year. Ricoh is also in the process of buying I.B.M.’s printing operations.“I.B.M. is really strong in the market for mission-critical applications like printing bills or checks,” said Ron Potesky, vice president for corporate product marketing at the Ricoh Americas Corporation.Ms. Mulcahy seems unworried. “Yes, there are a lot of people with aspirations, but we have a tremendous head start,” she said.Xerox has been on a buying spree of its own. This month it announced it was spending $1.5 billion to buy Global Imaging, a major distributor of office equipment to small and medium-size businesses.Until now, Global sold almost all brands except Xerox, but analysts expect that its 200,000 customers will be easily persuaded to switch brands.“Global has always offered great service, and its customers care more about that than the brand of machine,” said Shannon S. Cross, an analyst at Cross Research who rates Xerox shares a buy.Ms. Mulcahy points straight at Global when anyone questions her commitment to growth.“Buying Global was all about growing revenues,” she said. “So you could say we just invested $1.5 billion in a big catalyst for growth.”'"
"'07-04-21,'0','The New York Post is doubling its street sale price, to 50 cents from 25 cents.In a statement yesterday, the publisher of The Post, Paul Carlucci, explained the move this way: “We have had tremendous growth and success in our circulation and advertising, and this move is part of the process to make our entire business a success.”In other words, raising the newsstand price might help stem the paper’s losses, estimated to be about $70 million a year.The Post’s costs have increased recently as it has started to print editions outside of New York in Boston, Chicago, California and Florida. It recently ran a promotion in which it offered home delivery for $13 a year, or about 5 cents a day. And the paper is given away at many busy locales in Manhattan.Rupert Murdoch, whose company, the News Corporation, owns The Post, has said publicly that he keeps the paper despite its losses because he believes it can become financially successful. But it is also clear that he enjoys the political influence and the ability to zing his rivals that ownership of the irreverent New York tabloid affords.Increases in newspaper prices usually lead to a decrease in circulation. The Post declined to comment on how much circulation it expected to lose with the price increase and what the trade-off might be between increased revenue and any decline in readership.'"
"'07-04-21,'0','The officer in immediate command of three marines accused of killing civilians in a house-to-house attack in Haditha, Iraq, in 2005 has been granted immunity to testify at his subordinates’ military hearings, lawyers involved in the case said.In exchange, the officer, First Lt. William T. Kallop, agreed to answer all questions that prosecution or defense lawyers ask him, the lawyers said. The immunity granted to Lieutenant Kallop, who gave an order to take control of a house where several civilians were killed, could bolster the defense of the three enlisted men charged with murder in the case, lawyers said, because it would show that they were following orders.Lieutenant Kallop, 25, is one of at least eight marines granted immunity to testify about the attack on Nov. 19, 2005, that killed 24 people after the marines’ convoy was struck by a roadside bomb that killed Lance Cpl. Miguel Terrazas. Four officers also face charges of dereliction of duty for the way they dealt with the initial report of what happened in Haditha.Earlier this month, Lt. Gen. James N. Mattis, the Marine officer overseeing the prosecution of the case, dismissed charges against a fourth enlisted marine, Sgt. Sanick P. Dela Cruz, 24.General Mattis granted immunity to Lieutenant Kallop on April 3, days after lawyers for another marine facing murder charges asked the Marine Corps to grant immunity to Lieutenant Kallop so he could testify at hearings for the men, said Kevin B. McDermott, a civilian lawyer for an officer charged in the case. The grant of immunity was first reported in The Washington Post yesterday.'"
"'07-04-21,'0','Frank H. Westheimer, a Harvard chemist whose work in understanding how the body metabolizes alcohol became a model for similar studies in the growing field of biochemistry, died last Saturday at his home in Cambridge, Mass. He was 95. Dr. Westheimer’s death was confirmed by his family.In the early 1950s, while teaching at the University of Chicago, Dr. Westheimer applied the principles of physical-organic chemistry to investigate an enzyme used by the body in metabolizing alcohol. With another researcher, Birgit Vennesland, he succeeded in showing how the enzyme worked to remove hydrogen from the alcohol, a critical event in the process of breaking it down.The result was a closer understanding of the enzyme, known as alcohol dehydrogenase.Ronald C. D. Breslow, a professor of chemistry and biology at Columbia, said the study “showed us that we had to think much more carefully about how enzymes react within the body” and continues to be widely cited.Earlier, Dr. Westheimer collaborated with Joseph E. Mayer in studying the the structure of organic molecules, the building blocks of living things, which contain carbon, among other elements. In order to better understand how these molecules are assembled from atoms, they used physical forces to form shapes, in this case rings of carbon, and calculated the energy contained within them.Their findings were subsequently used as a model for similar studies of other elements and have been regarded as a seminal contribution to the field of molecular mechanics, said Daniel E. Koshland, a professor of molecular and cell biology at the University of California, Berkeley.'"
"'07-04-21,'0','The offers of cooperation will be laid out for Russian officials in the coming weeks in a series of high-level meetings being scheduled by senior American officials, in particular Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice. If those talks go well, they will continue over the summer and fall between President Bush and President Vladimir V. Putin.Despite a series of bilateral sessions and meetings under NATO sponsorship to explain the American missile defense plan, Mr. Putin and his inner circle have expressed deep resentment about it, voicing their anger in caustic public comments that have greatly worried some close American allies in Europe.The German government, in particular, has urged the administration to pull together the exact sort of initiative on missile defense cooperation and transparency that will be presented to Russia. The administration has also heard complaints from other allies, including France, that it must do better at managing the relationship with Russia if the United States wants allied support for the missile defense effort, American officials said.“In the past, the Russians have not taken our offers of cooperation seriously, whether because they view them as insufficient or because they are obstinate on missile defense,” said another senior administration official involved in planning the initiatives.“So Gates and then Rice will put their weight behind this new offer,” the official added. “We will not give Russia a veto over our program, but this goes well beyond ‘passive’ cooperation to new and active ways we can work together against common threats.”Another senior administration official, explaining the accelerated effort to reach out to Russia on the issue, conceded: “We were a little late to the game. We should have been out there making these arguments, making the case more forcefully before people began framing the debate for us — and in false terms.”The offer would include an invitation to open a joint effort at “research and technical development” of future missile defenses that could protect the territories of the United States and Russia, and their allies, the senior military officer said.Beyond that, with the permission of the Polish and Czech governments, any eventual American missile defense bases on their territories would be open to Russian inspection, akin to the guarantees that Washington and Moscow negotiated to inspect each other’s missile silos to assure compliance with past arms control treaties, officials said.“We are committed to the maximum level of transparency, not only with our citizens but with our neighbors,” said Karel Schwarzenberg, the Czech foreign minister, who was in Washington this week for talks with American officials on missile defense.Details about the new package of invitations for Russia to cooperate on missile defense were described by civilian administration officials and military officers who said they believed that the initiative was a major step forward in calming Russian objections to the American plans.In its proposals on missile defense, the Bush administration is asking Poland to base 10 antimissile interceptors on its territory and the Czech Republic to be host to a tracking radar. Both systems are designed to defend European territory from missile attack by Iran, but have threatened to rupture ties with Moscow and have upset some NATO allies.Nevertheless, the Bush administration and the military are showing unusual unanimity about proceeding with missile defense, in sharp contrast to bitter internal disagreements over issues like Iraq strategy and rules for detaining and interrogating terrorism suspects.The groundwork for upcoming talks with Russia by Mr. Gates and Ms. Rice has been laid over recent weeks by quiet but intensive travels to Moscow and NATO capitals by a group of civilian and military officials. They include the under secretary of defense for policy, Eric Edelman; two assistant secretaries of state, Daniel Fried and John Rood; Lt. Gen. Henry A. Obering III, director of the Missile Defense Agency, and his deputy, Brig. Gen. Patrick O’Reilly; and the American ambassador to NATO, Victoria Nuland.American officials hold no illusions that the new incentives will guarantee Russia’s assent to the missile defense bases in Poland and the Czech Republic, as the Kremlin’s opposition to missile bases is wrapped up in domestic politics as well as its view of national security policy in Washington and its NATO allies.To date, Russian officials have scoffed at any suggestion that Moscow’s objections to American missile defense bases in former Soviet states would be eased by offers of cooperation.“As for possible cooperation in strategic antimissile defense, honestly speaking, I see no reasons for that,” said Sergei B. Ivanov, a first deputy prime minister who previously served as Russia’s minister of defense, in remarks quoted by the Interfax news agency.American officials have sought to counter Russian rebukes by pointing out that the limited missile defense system envisioned for Europe — 10 interceptors whose warheads are designed to collide with approaching missiles, and do not even carry an explosive — is numerically no threat to Moscow’s vast strategic rocket force.The proposed system, Americans say, is a prudent deterrent against a potential Iranian attack on American allies in Europe and on American forces based there.American officials concede that part of the Russian motivation to block American missile defense is a fear that the United States, over time, might develop a bold, new “breakout” technology that could some day neuter the Russian strategic arsenal.The concept of sharing antimissile technology with the Russians is hardly new. In fact, even when President Ronald Reagan proposed his grand plan for a leakproof missile shield under the so-called Star Wars program, he pledged that the new technology could be shared with the Kremlin in order to assure Russia that it had nothing to fear from American defenses.The missile defense proposals for central Europe also have become a proxy issue for Russian officials who still rankle at American and NATO expansion east after the collapse of the Soviet Union.Yet even among some officials in Poland and the Czech Republic, support for the two missile defense bases has more to do with binding the United States closer to their capitals against a future Russian threat than about deterring a future Iranian missile threat.American officials have not announced the timetable for the coming talks. But in Moscow, Igor Ivanov, the secretary of Russia’s Security Council, said that Mr. Gates was due there for Kremlin meetings on Monday and that Ms. Rice would visit in May.'"
"'07-04-21,'0','WHEN it comes to hedge funds, do the extremely rich know more than the rest of us?While institutions are increasing their holdings in hedge funds — and some of the largest hedge funds are planning to sell shares to an eagerly awaiting public — the wealthiest Americans have been bailing out, Bloomberg Markets reports.“Americans with a net worth of at least $25 million, excluding the value of their primary homes, reduced their exposure to hedge funds in 2006,” Jenny Strasburg writes, citing research by the Spectrem Group, a consulting firm that specializes in retirement savings and investing by the affluent.Some 38 percent of the wealthy investors surveyed had money in hedge funds in 2005. That number fell to 27 percent last year, and the amount of money that wealthy investors had in hedge funds fell by an even greater percentage. The average balance, which was $2.8 million in 2005, was just $1.6 million last year, a 43 percent decline.“What some individuals say is that hedge funds have become too risky, and it’s unclear to them where the returns are being generated,” said George H. Walper Jr., president of Spectrem.MANIC MONEY The traditional wisdom is that you do not want to invest in a mutual fund that trades frequently, because each trade adds a commission, which is deducted from potential returns. That is one main reason that most financial experts recommend a buy-and-hold investment approach.'"
"'07-04-21,'0','Vault Inc., a career consulting firm, informally asked employers if they would watch a video résumé if it were submitted to them, and most said yes. Employers also said video résumés would become a common addition to future job applications.“We live in an on-demand world where people want the most detailed information to make a decision, as well as the ability to make that decision quickly,” said Nicholas Murphy, 27, the co-founder of WorkBlast.com. The site, which made its debut last week, aims to help users create online video résumés. It also allows employers to videotape themselves so they can advertise to prospective employees.The trainer Dr. Rawitt hired, Bill McGowan, is a former anchor, reporter and producer at ABC, and he specializes in the visumé— a two-and-a-half- minute visual résumé. He has created about a dozen in the last year, at a charge of $3,500 each.“Many people don’t have the proper experience in being engaging and welcoming to this piece of technology,” said Mr. McGowan, founder of the Clarity Media Group in Manhattan. “How do they engage a piece of metal with the same kind of warmth that they might engage someone individually? That’s the big hurdle for some of these people.”Mr. McGowan and his colleagues typically videotape clients, and then dissect their performance together, evaluating everything from posture to eye contact, to physical appearance to vocal moderation.That is why Lucy Cherkasets, who is now 26, hired Mr. McGowan when she was trying to land a job out of college four years ago. “I wanted to make myself stand out from the rest of the pack,” said Ms. Cherkasets, who was seeking an entry-level position in advertising or marketing.Mr. McGowan took out his video camera and together they role-played an interview. They evaluated her body language and helped her tweak her responses. She now works in the human resources department at LaForce & Stevens, a public relations firm in Manhattan.“I used it to apply for the jobs I wanted the most,” she said. “I wanted to be selective because this was a unique new way to approach the job search. It was something that certainly made me stand out. People, particularly H.R. professionals, were impressed by the initiative and creativity as well. It allowed me to show them my interest and got them to ‘see’ me before they even talked with me.”Media trainers have other uses as well. Five years ago, Bob Plunkett, a former television news anchor living in Bedford, N.Y., was driving to Boston with his daughter, Maggie, who was interviewing for admission to Wheaton College in Norton, Mass.“She said, ‘Do you think they’re going to ask me if I have any questions?’ ” he recalled. “I said ‘Absolutely! That’s how the interview closes.’ I realized that she didn’t really have a plan for doing this interview. She just figured, ‘They’d ask me questions and I’d answer them.’ And I’d say, this is a big interview that could change your life, and you’re approaching it haphazardly.”Since then, he has trained more than 50 high school seniors. He charges $500.“Essentially, he teaches how to control the conversation, how to have an agenda going into the interview and getting it across no matter what the questions are, so you know what you’re going to say,” said Charlie Waln, who enlisted Mr. Plunkett’s help when he was applying to Duke University in 2003 (he was accepted on early admission).About 75 percent of Karen Friedman’s work has nothing to do with television or even print media. Instead, she trains senior management preparing for product approvals and withdrawals, manufacturing shutdowns, employee layoffs, educational campaigns and even videoconferencing.“Executives fall into a trap of speaking business-speak,” said Ms. Friedman, a media trainer outside Philadelphia. “While they might speak the language of their subject, it’s like listening to someone who’s stuck in a tunnel. They’re in a fog. The point they really need to get across gets muddled, lost and unfocused. What is it you want the listener to remember about your message when you’re done communicating?”Vincent T. Donnelly, the president and chief executive of the PMA Insurance Group in Blue Bell, Pa., credits Ms. Friedman for helping with his delivery at lectures and speaking at public events. “I need to put things in concrete terms the layperson could understand, not in insurance jargon. She helped me do that.”And while the camera can be brutal, it is a necessary tool, especially in today’s highly recorded climate. “People will tell you that they’re perceived as dynamic, engaging, interesting, with full command of the material,” Ms. Friedman said. “And then they see themselves on videotape or DVD and it’s a rude awakening, because they see how other people really see them. You can pick up odd mannerisms you’re not aware of. You may have the words down and the verbal techniques, but your body language might give away that you’re nervous or unsure of yourself.”Debra Benton, a media trainer in Fort Collins, Colo., got her start in beauty pageants, which she believes are terrific training grounds for corporate America. “You have to walk across the stage in high heels almost naked in front of thousands of people,” she said. “That’s exactly how most of us feel in a job interview — like we’re naked in front of people.”She tells the executives and job interviewees that she coaches that their No. 1 responsibility is to “maintain the self-esteem of others.” Don’t falsely pump up someone’s ego, but make him or her feel like you’re engaged. “People will soon forget what you have accomplished and long remember how you made them feel,” she said. “That’s true on a date, in a job interview, even in Congress. You can get more of an emotional response if you can tap at the heartstrings.”Her other piece of advice? Do everything purposefully, and slow down. “Not to the point where you look like you’re dragging with energy,” she said. “But most of us go too fast; we hurry; we look anxious. The more time you give yourself, the more status people give you. If you slow down, you look calm and make others calm around you. For instance, when shaking hands, pump two and a half times instead of one. You only have seconds to set yourself apart.”'"
"'07-04-21,'0','If private health plans are supposedly so great at delivering high-quality care while holding down costs, why does the government have to keep subsidizing them so lavishly to participate in the Medicare program?About a fifth of elderly Americans now belong to private Medicare Advantage plans, which — thanks to government subsidies — often charge less or offer more than traditional Medicare. As Congress struggles to find savings that could offset the costs of other important health programs, it should take a long and hard look at those subsidies.The authoritative Medicare Payment Advisory Commission estimates that the government pays private plans 12 percent more, on average, than the same services would cost in the traditional Medicare fee-for-service program. The private plans use some of this money to make themselves more attractive to beneficiaries — by reducing premiums or adding benefits not covered by basic Medicare — and siphon off the rest to add to profits and help cover the plans’ high administrative costs.Although the insurance industry insists that the subsidies are much lower and are warranted by the benefits provided, Thomas Scully, who headed the Medicare program for the Bush administration until 2003, told reporters recently that the subsidies were too large and ought to be reduced by Congress.The largest private enrollment is in health maintenance organizations, which typically deliver care a bit more cheaply than standard Medicare and should not need their 10 percent subsidies, on average, to compete. The biggest subsidies — averaging 19 percent above cost — go to private fee-for-service plans, which are the fastest-growing part of the Medicare Advantage program. Unlike the H.M.O.’s, which at least manage a patient’s care and bargain hard with doctors and hospitals, these plans ride on the coattails of standard Medicare, typically providing access to the same doctors and paying them at the same rates. Thanks to the big subsidies they get, such plans are often a good deal for beneficiaries, charging less for the same benefits or adding benefits without raising prices.The main losers are the beneficiaries in the standard Medicare program, whose monthly premiums are roughly $2 higher to help pay for the subsidies, and the taxpayers who pick up part of the tab. The subsidies also erode the long-term solvency of Medicare, which needs to rein in costs, not increase them with handouts to insurance companies.When the Democrats first won control of Congress, it seemed possible that they might eliminate the subsidies — saving some $54 billion over five years — to finance a $50 billion expansion of a health insurance program for low-income children. But the insurance industry has mounted a furious lobbying campaign to head off any cuts.'"

They don’t want self-confidence to look like self-love.John Edwards has reminded us that even — or especially — in the age of appearances, you must not appear to care too much about appearances.When you spend more on a couple of haircuts than Burundi’s per capita G.D.P. , it looks so vain it makes Paul Wolfowitz’s ablutions spitting on his comb look like rugged individualism.Following his star turn primping his hair for two minutes on a YouTube video to the tune of “I Feel Pretty,” Mr. Edwards this week had to pay back the $800 charged to his campaign for two shearings at Torrenueva Hair Designs in Beverly Hills. He seems intent on proving that he is a Breck Girl — and a Material Boy.He did not pony up for the pricey bills from Designworks Salon in Dubuque, Iowa, or the Pink Sapphire spa in Manchester, which offers services for men that include the “Touch of Youth” facial, as well as trips “into the intriguing world of makeup.” The Edwards campaign calls makeup a legitimate expense.Speaking of roots, my dad, a police detective who was in charge of Senate security, got haircuts at the Senate barbershop for 50 cents. He cut my three brothers’ hair and did the same for anyone else in the neighborhood who wanted a free clip job. Even now, Mr. Edwards could get his hair cut at the Senate barbershop for $21 or the Chapel Hill Barber Shop near his campaign headquarters for $16.So it’s hard for me to understand how a guy could spend $400 without getting Bergdorf Blonde highlights. (The tabloids claim that Brad and Jen used to get matching streaks.) And don’t campaign donors get snippy about sponsoring tonsorial treats?Someone who aspires to talk credibly about the two Americas can’t lavish on his locks what working families may spend on electricity in a year. You can’t sell earnestness while indulging in decadence.Mr. Edwards, the son of a mill worker, moved from a $5.2 million, six-bedroom Federal mansion in Georgetown to a 28,000-square-foot behemoth in North Carolina with a basketball court, a squash court, two stages and a swimming pool.His 25-year-old daughter, Cate, a former editorial assistant for Vanity Fair, co-founded Urbanista, an online Rolodex that dispenses advice for “hip” girls in Manhattan, offering to be a “bestie” (a best friend) and answer questions like “Where should I go to get my Marc Jacobs shoes reheeled?” and “Does anyone know the best place to get a really great haircut?” One salon the site recommends is Warren-Tricomi, where Edward Tricomi says haircuts range from $121 to $300.The cost of grooming hair is peanuts compared with the cost of grooming an image. Hillary is paying a fortune to try to buy the secrets of likability. Her financial reports for the first three months of 2007 show debts to consulting firms of $447,000.John McCain, who’s supposed to be giving it to us straight, has a jaw-dropping herd of consultants to tell him how to do that. Dubbed “the 2007 Full Employment Act for Campaign Consultants,” the McCain crew spent $645,000 on fund-raising consultants in the first quarter and $400,000 on political consultants in key states (four in South Carolina alone). His top political adviser, John Weaver, got more than $60,000 in just three months.Obviously, there’s a lot of waste in political campaigns. But you don’t have to be as flinty as Mitt Romney — who has made his staff triple up at cheap hotels — to know there’s something special about throwing away money on vanity.All the haircuts in the world may not save John Edwards from a blowout.'"

"'07-04-22,'0','Why was his heart beating so slowly? the doctor wondered. Had he taken too much of one of his medications? Had he suffered a heart attack that affected the natural pacemaker in his heart?Part of the answer came less than an hour later. The lab called to report that the patient’s kidneys weren’t working. And his potassium — an essential element in body chemistry, regulated by the kidneys — was dangerously high. Potassium controls how easily a cell responds to the body’s commands. Too little potassium, and the cells overreact to any stimulation; too much, and the body slows down. The patient was given a medicine to get the potassium out of his system and then transferred to the I.C.U. for monitoring.If the potassium was high because of his kidney failure, what had caused his kidneys to fail? Dr. Perry Smith, the intern on call in the I.C.U., gnawed at this question as he reviewed the chart and examined the patient. It wasn’t a drug error. The patient’s medication box showed the correct number of pills. And it hadn’t been a heart attack; a blood test proved that. Smith looked for the results of the urinalysis to see if there was any clue there. Somehow no one had sent any urine to the lab. Were his kidneys too damaged to produce urine? That would be important to know. Smith asked the nurse to get some urine from the patient.She returned empty-handed. The patient couldn’t urinate, and she hadn’t been able to insert a Foley catheter, a rubber tube that is passed through the urethra into the bladder to collect urine. Was something blocking the urethra? A urology resident finally managed to get a catheter into the bladder. Urine gushed out — nearly half a gallon of it. A full bladder normally holds only a quarter of that. The urology resident looked at the intern: “I guess now we know why his kidneys weren’t working.”The urethra was blocked — by the prostate gland. The prostate surrounds the urethra, and when it enlarges, as it often does with age, it impinges on the narrow outlet, obstructing and ultimately blocking it so that no urine can pass. As the trapped liquid filled the bladder, the pressure shut down the patient’s kidneys.Just hours after the obstruction was relieved, his potassium began to drop as the kidneys went back to work. Four hours later, the patient’s heart rate was up over 60. By the next morning, the abdominal pain, probably caused by his hugely distended bladder, had eased. When he left the hospital three days later, his potassium and heart rate were normal and his kidneys, nearly so. He would have to keep the tube in his bladder until his prostate could be removed.I was out of town that first day and had to follow my patient’s progress by telephone. When I heard that the prostate was the cause of the life-threatening bradycardia, I felt as if I had been punched in the chest. This was something I should have caught and didn’t. An internist’s job is to diagnose and treat acute illness and screen for and prevent additional disease. I joke with the residents I teach that it is our responsibility to keep our patients healthy and out of the hospital. If so, I had failed.Screening for disease has two parts: usually a physical exam and what is known as a review of systems, a set of questions used to elicit symptoms of a disease the patient is at risk for. This patient, with his high blood pressure, high cholesterol and stroke, would be at risk for a heart attack, another stroke and, like many men his age, prostate problems. I should have asked about these at every visit and once a year done a rectal exam to assess prostate size and look for cancer. From reviewing the patient’s chart, it appeared I had limited my attention and my exam to his immediate problems — overlooking some of the other risks he faced.I had asked him if he had problems urinating, and he had said no. I don’t think he was lying; I think he assumed that his bathroom difficulty was just one more skill stolen from him by his stroke. So much of the damage from that cerebral vascular accident was clearly visible and public. I suspect he felt that this disability, at least, could remain private.And when he didn’t acknowledge any difficulties, I was happy to allow our visits to focus on getting his blood pressure and cholesterol under control, educating him on his medical problems, managing his meds and arranging his transportation and rehab. Everything else I treated as a long-term goal, to be attended to once these very pressing short-term needs were managed. Understandable perhaps, but it almost killed him. Practicing medicine is a balancing act — weighing immediate and long-term good. His case was a vivid reminder of what can happen when that balance is lost.I didn’t visit my patient in the hospital. Normally I would have, but I was worried that he would be as angry with me as I was with myself. I saw him the following week. “I’m so sorry,” I started. He smiled his magnificent smile and squeezed my hand. “No matter,” he said, his words still slurred but back to their normal rhythm. He reached into his pocket, produced a few of his pecans from North Carolina and offered them to me. I took them gratefully. Perhaps I could be forgiven.'"
"'07-04-22,'0','Saying America must be weaned from its reliance on foreign oil, Senator John McCain of Arizona is renewing his call for a cap on emissions of greenhouse gases as a way to fight global warming.In the text of a speech he is scheduled to deliver on Monday in Washington, Senator McCain said: “The problem isn’t a Hollywood invention nor is doing something about it a vanity of Cassandra-like hysterics. It is a serious and urgent economic, environmental and national security challenge.”Today, members of his campaign staff released excerpts of the speech, the last of three major addresses by Mr. McCain in the run-up to the formal start later this week of his campaign for the Republican presidential nomination. The first speech focused on why he continues to support sending more troops to Iraq, and the second involved his economic proposals.“The world is already feeling the powerful effects of global warming,” the text of Monday’s speech said, “and far more dire consequences are predicted if we let the growing deluge of greenhouse gas emissions continue and wreak havoc with God’s creation.”Mr. McCain describes energy independence as a pressing national security issue. He warns that selling oil props up Iran, which he describes as “the No. 1 state sponsor of terrorism.” And he says that President Hugo Chávez of Venezuela is “using his country’s oil revenues to establish a dictatorship, bully his neighbors and succeed Castro as Latin America’s leading antagonist of the United States.”“National security depends on energy security, which we cannot achieve if we remain dependent on imported oil from Middle Eastern governments who support, or foment by their own inattention and inequities, the rise of terrorists, or on swaggering demagogues and would-be dictators in our hemisphere,” he said in one excerpt from the speech.Mr. McCain, who has introduced legislation to lower carbon emissions, said that as president he would set “reasonable caps” on carbon and other greenhouse gas emissions, and would allow companies that reduce their emissions to earn credits that they can trade for a profit.'"
"'07-04-22,'0','Carter scored 16 points, but shot only 5 of 19 and was limited to 33 minutes because of foul trouble. The small forward Richard Jefferson compensated by making 11 of 21 shots and scoring a game-high 28 points.The reserve forward Bostjan Nachbar added 16 points, including a crucial 3-pointer with 2 minutes 43 seconds remaining that extended the Nets’ lead to 87-83.The Raptors had cut a 13-point deficit at the start of the fourth quarter to 1 with less than three minutes left.Many of the Raptors’ fans wore red shirts as part of the team’s postseason campaign — even though the Nets wore red road uniforms. That did not go unnoticed by Jefferson.“The biggest shock for us was how much support we got from Toronto fans,” Jefferson said with a smile. “I think that was exciting, the fact that they all came out and wore red to show us a lot of love.”The fervor of the already boisterous Toronto crowd was compounded by Carter’s presence. Once the Raptors’ franchise player, Carter now brings out anger in fans who feel he gave up on the team shortly before he was traded to the Nets in 2004. A couple of fans wore bibs bearing Carter’s No. 15. They held various signs and shouted insults.It might not be a coincidence that Carter missed six of his first seven shots and had only 7 points through three quarters. Early in the second half, Carter picked up his third and fourth fouls in a span of 10 seconds. He sat out the final 9:33 of the third quarter.But with his mother, Michelle, watching calmly from the front row behind one of the baskets, Carter made a couple of crucial plays in the fourth quarter.The Raptors used a 12-2 run that began four minutes into the fourth quarter to narrow the Nets’ lead to 1 point. Carter’s two free throws accounted for the Nets’ only points during that stretch.Carter, who made five free throws and scored 9 points in the fourth, later made a driving layup to extend the Nets’ lead to 7 points with 1:21 to play.That got his mother, who had been the subject of some of the fans’ heckling, to break from her stoic demeanor, clapping and yelling words of encouragement.“I was ready to play, playoffs atmosphere, coming back here to play,” Carter said. “It is always great; the welcome is always exciting.”The Nets answered the Raptors’ run with a 7-1 spurt. The Nets did not look rattled, despite the crowd and the feisty young Raptors, who already had their Atlantic Division regular-season championship banner hanging from the rafters.The Nets failed to capture that banner, mostly because they lost 12 games in which they entered the fourth quarter with a lead.“You’re always interested as to what might transpire in the first playoff game, particularly on the road,” said Rod Thorn, the Nets’ president. “They made a great comeback in the fourth quarter; game could’ve gone either way. It’s nice that we closed it out.”The Nets remain a long way from regaining the swagger they took into this season. They once had aspirations of winning the conference and even the N.B.A. title.For now, they will look with smiles upon their longest winning streak since a 14-game run that ended April 8, 2006.“The last few games before the playoffs, we strapped it down and played pretty good basketball,” said Nets center Mikki Moore, who had 9 points and 7 rebounds. “I knew we were going to take that momentum into the playoffs. Everybody on our team is concentrating, and they’re focused.”'"
"'07-04-22,'0','KABUL, Afghanistan, April 21 — The Taliban demanded Saturday that France withdraw its troops from Afghanistan and that the Afghan government release all Taliban prisoners as conditions for the release of two French aid workers and three Afghan colleagues being held hostage.The aid workers were working for Terre d’Enfance, a nongovernmental organization. They were kidnapped in southwestern Afghanistan on April 3. A spokesman, Qari Yousuf Ahmadi, telephoned The New York Times’s bureau in Kabul on Saturday to announce the Taliban’s conditions for the aid workers’ release.The Afghan government has said that it will not consider another exchange of Taliban prisoners for hostages after it was criticized for releasing five Taliban commanders and spokesmen last month in exchange for an Italian journalist.President Hamid Karzai has nevertheless promised the French government his utmost cooperation.The Taliban also announced an increase in their operations against foreign and Afghan forces here.The Taliban leader, Mullah Muhammad Omar, also issued a rare statement, asking fighters to step up suicide attacks and to remain united.'"
"'07-04-22,'0','But the agencies most heavily involved in managing the construction, the state’s Dormitory Authority and the state’s Office of Court Administration, say the delays and cost overruns have been unavoidable, given the ambitious scope of the project.Ronald Younkins, chief of operations for the Office of Court Administration, said that not long after the August 2001 groundbreaking ceremony, the project’s low bidder was disqualified because of suspected mob ties.Later, soil at the site was found to have been contaminated with petroleum.Bad weather and other problems also caused some delays.“On many public projects, there often are problems and delays, and on this one, we had a couple right from the get-go,” Mr. Younkins said.Paul Burgdorf, a spokesman for the Dormitory Authority, which provides financing and construction services to various state institutions, said the problem with the building’s garage appears to be the result of a contractor’s mistake, rather than a design flaw.While the courthouse is scheduled to open during the last week of May, the garage’s ceiling needs major repair work, officials said, which will further add to the project’s cost.The hall of justice, which is located in a section of the South Bronx dominated by courthouses, is meant to help relieve overcrowding caused by an increase in the number of civil and criminal cases in the city.For the past two decades, the Bronx County Courthouse, at 161st Street and the Grand Concourse, and the Bronx Family/Criminal Courthouse, a few blocks east on 161st Street, have each held the borough’s criminal cases once the criminal courthouse ran out of room.Space remained tight even after some of the Bronx borough president’s offices and most of the Bronx district attorney’s offices moved out of the county courthouse during the past decade, and a building to house the Bronx Housing Court opened on the Grand Concourse in 1997.As a result, some courtrooms in the older buildings were divided to make two. Offices were also turned into courtrooms. Now, the Bronx County Courthouse, which had 28 courtrooms when it was built in 1933, has 63, which is still not enough.Once the new hall of justice opens, courtrooms in the two older courthouses will be refurbished, and many of the rooms will be returned to their original size, officials said.“This is going to give us a chance to decompress and make sure each room is suitable for a court — and not in somebody’s former office,” Mr. Younkins said.With its green tinted glass and aluminum front, the new courthouse dominates a streetscape of concrete and mortar structures that house government offices a few blocks from Yankee Stadium.It is nine stories tall with two underground levels in addition to the garage, has 47 large courtrooms and a total of about 800,000 square feet, making it one of the largest courthouses in the United States.An earlier design for the hall of justice called for a 30-story skyscraper with a day care center and retail shops at ground level and a street running through the complex. After the 1995 bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City, however, designers essentially started from scratch.Fred Wilmers, project director for Rafael Viñoly Architects, which designed the building, said the firm had sought to build a structure that was welcoming rather than intimidating.“These buildings have traditionally been like fortresses,” Mr. Wilmers said. “We look to change that perception. The transparency is sort of figurative, but there is some in the literal sense as well.”The building’s glass wall, which subtly changes color as it rises from street level in two different patterns, has been described as resembling a stretched-out accordion.At street level, the windows are opaque for privacy and security; they become clearer at the top.The glass was tested at a blast simulator at the White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico to ensure it could absorb the shock waves of a bomb blast.Each window is laminated and held together by a plastic inner layer that was then glued into the frame with silicone so that the glass will not shatter or fly out.Throughout the building, security was made a priority. A street designed to run through the complex has been converted into a pedestrian walkway.The windows in the building’s lobbies and in the judges’ chambers are bullet-resistant, and the loading dock, mail room and public plaza have all been built with bomb-resistant material.Because of security concerns, it is unclear whether a rooftop rock garden will ever be open to the public.Eight courtrooms have flat-screen video monitors and video systems to enable witnesses to testify from remote locations, allow inmates to watch from the building’s holding cells, or give inmates the possibility of making their preliminary trial appearances from Rikers Island instead of having to be bused to the courthouse.'"
"'07-04-22,'0','Carlos Lee was all smiles around his former Brewers teammates Geoff Jenkins and Bill Hall. Meanwhile, Lee’s new manager, Phil Garner, compared him to some of the past greats in Milwaukee.“He’s a very even-tempered guy,” said Garner, who managed Milwaukee from 1992-99. “Robin Yount was this way, Paul Molitor was this way, some of the great pitchers I’ve had, they’re very even-tempered.”Lee, a slugging outfielder, was traded from Milwaukee to the Texas Rangers on July 28 in a six-player deal that sent outfielder Kevin Mench and reliever Francisco Cordero to the Brewers. Lee left Texas in the off-season through free agency and signed a six-year, $100 million deal with Houston.The Brewers had offered Lee a four-year deal before trading him, saying they did not receive a counteroffer. Lee said he tried to come to an agreement.“The team made a good effort to try and keep me here, and I don’t blame them,” he said before the Astros played the Brewers in Milwaukee on Friday night. “But we’ve got to be realistic. They couldn’t offer me the six-year deal I was looking for, so I had to go.”'"
"'07-04-22,'0','James E. Katz, director of the Center for Mobile Computing at Rutgers University, said the data coming from the devices was really secondary. “Look at a lot of the communication — it’s idiotic in terms of substance,” Mr. Katz said. “But it’s vital in terms of meaning.”Mr. Katz argues that participation gives people a sense of belonging, one traceable to the atavistic desire to congregate and cooperate for safety and survival. In addition, he said, the constant checking is an exercise in optimism, like being an explorer or a gambler. Eternal hope delivered in tiny bits while you’re on the go.“It’s random reinforcement,” Mr. Katz said. The fact that you don’t know when important news will come, he said, “means you will quickly engage in obsessive compulsive behavior.”These social needs and yearnings may drive the use. But at some point, that use becomes an end unto itself — a physical ritual that can take on some of the qualities of actual addiction, said Dr. John Ratey, a clinical associate professor of psychiatry at Harvard, where he specializes in neuropsychiatry.Several years ago, Mr. Ratey began using the term “acquired attention deficit disorder” to describe the condition of people who are accustomed to a constant stream of digital stimulation and feel bored in the absence of it. Regardless of whether the stimulation is from the Internet, TV or a cellphone, the brain, he said, is hijacked.“I liken it to a drug,” Mr. Ratey said. “Drug addicts don’t think; they just start moving. Like moving for your BlackBerry.”When the BlackBerry system faltered on Tuesday night, Steven M. Krausz, a Silicon Valley venture capitalist, was attending an industry dinner at a conference in Washington, D.C. The malfunction didn’t interrupt his habit.“I checked it at least a dozen times during dinner,” Mr. Krausz said, in part because he was curious about when service would be restored but also because the constant checking was a placeholder for less desirable activities.“I’d rather reach for the BlackBerry than reach for bread or dessert and put some high-cholesterol item in my mouth,” he said, calling his habit “a reflexive response.” Besides, he added, he checked his device regularly “because it was a boring dinner speaker.”There were two speakers, actually: Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, and Dr. Tadataka Yamada, executive director of global health for the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. Not the least boring to some listeners, but the threshold for boredom is low these days, say compulsive device operators.BlackBerry users do half-joke that they have become junkies, insatiable data tokers. But because the tool is tied to productivity, defined by some as essential to modern employment, overusers don’t really regard their habit as the digital equivalent of firing up a Marlboro outside work.Perhaps they should re-examine the tie to productivity, however. The technology creates the allusion that every moment can be a productive one, said Tara Hunt, 33, a marketing director for a technology consulting company in San Francisco. When you’re not participating, it’s like you’re suggesting that you’re not keeping up, she said.“I might think I’m missing out if Google bought another company and I wasn’t part of the echo chamber around it,” Ms. Hunt said, referring to the chance she’d miss news of an industry development. “At the end of the day, it doesn’t matter a whole lot.”B. Marc Averitt, a technology investor, said that on the face of it, his fear was that someone would send him a message, become frustrated and bored if there wasn’t an immediate response, then go look elsewhere for an answer. He keeps up, he said, because everyone else is doing it, forcing his hand.But on a deeper level, Mr. Averitt said he found a frustrating, even counterproductive, psychological fixation. And one that he sometimes has to satisfy in secret. On vacations, he said, he has been known to check his BlackBerry even after promising his wife he wouldn’t. His wife says the activity takes him out of the real emotions of the present.And perhaps, for some, that is the point.Dr. Ratey, from Harvard, likens the problem to a food addiction, which is one of the most beguiling for psychiatrists. After all, he said, food is essential for life, but problematic in excessive doses. And that’s what makes breaking technology addiction so difficult.Sometimes the habit is there even when the device isn’t. Users talk of phantom urges, like (no kidding) the feeling of a hip vibrating, as if to suggest a belt-hooked BlackBerry is buzzing when, in fact, the person is the shower. Others hear a beep in the night, say from outdoors or an alarm clock, and reach for the device.'"

But the First District Court of Appeals in San Francisco derailed those plans in January, after a challenge from the preservation group.But Mr. Jobs did not take no for an answer.

"'07-04-22,'0','It seems unlikely that the iPod generation will ever be able to tell the kinds of stories that David Cale and Dael Orlandersmith recount and enact in “The Blue Album,” the sharply written, beautifully performed vignettes and character sketches that run through April 29 at Long Wharf Theater’s Stage II.In the new world of the iPod, you create your own musical universe. In the older world of “The Blue Album,” listening to music means joining a tribe. Although its locales range from punk-era London to Harlem in the ’50s to Malibu in 1960, and its characters include a Polish Holocaust survivor, a rape victim and a Dolly Parton fan, the play is more than a well-chosen anthology of bits.Of course, the production imposes a visible structure on the work, with Neil Patel’s indigo-blue dream-box of a set and the moody wash of Jennifer Tipton’s lighting. But it’s the writing itself that weaves the various pieces together, with a subtle but unmistakable backbeat about the ways in which music can seep into a life, the ways in which it can create a community.Ask Mr. Cale’s flamboyantly gay Trevor, who comes into the record store where David, also played by Mr. Cale, works, to buy “Liza With a Zed.” Ask Ms. Orlandersmith’s Yiddish-accented Herman, who has a melancholy barstool encounter with Billie Holiday. Or her Al, a sputtering uptown geezer who has to take “two damned trains” to get down to an impossible-to-find club in Greenwich Village — “Why the hell didn’t Nina Simone play the damned Apollo?,” he wants to know.Part of the pleasure of watching “The Blue Album” comes from the mix-and-match way the writer-performers trade places and personas. There’s no way to know for sure who wrote what, who lived what. It’s a pretty good bet that Mr. Cale drew “5th Street” from his own life — in it, a woman assails two gay men looking out the window of their apartment with a homophobic tirade — and that Ms. Orlandersmith experienced the excruciating moment portrayed in “Bellagio (2003),” in which “a perfumed, well-dressed, well-read” writer in Italy is mistaken for a servant. But she’s the one telling the Fifth Street story, and he’s the one acting in the Bellagio episode.The play’s 22 “tracks,” as they are called in the program, emerged from what sounds very much like a “let’s put on a show” collaboration among Mr. Cale and Ms. Orlandersmith, who are playwrights, performers and East Village neighbors, and Gordon Edelstein, who heads the Long Wharf and who commissioned and directed “The Blue Album.” Mr. Edelstein writes in his program note that they discarded “thousands of pages” during the two years they worked on it. The 90 minutes that remain, laced with snatches of song by Mr. Cale, play like theatrical chamber music.'"
"'07-04-22,'0','In 1978 most people bought bottled water only before a big storm, in case the electricity went out. That was the year the General Assembly decided to tack a nickel deposit onto containers of carbonated beverages like soda and beer. The law’s purpose was to reduce litter, and it accomplished that.But times change. The amount of bottled water sold has doubled in the last three years. It has gone from 206 million in 2002 to 426 million in 2005, according to the Connecticut Recycling Institute. The institute predicts more than 1 billion bottles of water will be sold here in 2010.That incredible statistic is the best argument for expanding the bottle bill to include deposits on bottles of water and other noncarbonated beverages such as tea and fruit drinks.This year’s bill has a good chance of passing, despite opposition from grocers and similar groups who say it will increase the costs they incur when collecting the bottles. To help offset those costs, the proposal would increase handling fees for such groups to 3 cents a bottle from the current 1.5 cents.But the bill has one persistent and maddening flaw. It continues the patently outrageous practice of allowing the bottling industry to keep the unclaimed bottle deposits, which amount to an estimated $25 million a year. The industry claims the money is needed to offset costs. But there has never been an independent audit of those costs, nor has there been an audit to figure out exactly how much of the people’s unclaimed deposits roll in every year, only to be turned over to the bottlers.'"
"'07-04-22,'0','EVER since November, some cryptic words have greeted hundreds of thousands of harried drivers near the entrance to the Pulaski Skyway here — not with the usual come-ons for beer or cars or radio stations, but with a message instead about green and dark and thinking or something — it’s hard to catch it all at 60 miles an hour.Specifically, the sign reads, “IT IS GREEN THINKS NATURE EVEN IN THE DARK.”The glowing red neon letters that make up the message stand eight feet high and stretch across the windows of the former American Can Company building. They can be seen from planes landing at Newark Liberty International Airport, according to the sign’s creator, Mary Ellen Carroll, a Manhattan artist.Among those who have puzzled over what this could mean is a blogger who calls himself “The Slush God” (real name: John Joseph Adams, an assistant editor at the Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction in Jersey City), who wrote that he didn’t “understand the phrase or what this is supposed to accomplish, unless its goal is to perplex commuters and possibly cause accidents.” Confusing drivers and prompting them to run to Google for answers was actually part of the plan of those who installed the sign. Plug any part of the phrase into a search engine, and you will discover links to the Precipice Alliance, a nonprofit group based in Manhattan, whose goal is to raise awareness of global warming. The site explains the project, an installation called “Indestructible Language,” and its carbon-neutral energy usage via solar power.As Ms. Carroll explains the words on the sign: “If we know what is scientifically proven — that the condition exists,” she said, referring to global warming, “and as an individual or as a group — or what have you — if you choose not to either believe it and to do something about it in some way, then that’s the choice of remaining ‘in the dark.’ ”She added, “ ‘It’ refers to the color green, ‘it’ refers to the environment, ‘it’ refers to greenhouse gases, but ‘it’ also refers to money.”'"
"'07-04-22,'0','FEMINISM first reared its lacquered head on a hit sitcom in 1966.Marlo Thomas, playing “That Girl” Ann Marie, proved that an aspiring New York actress with a flip hairdo could live alone and conquer showbiz — or at least persuade Ethel Merman to come over and cook dinner for her once.Four years later Mary Tyler Moore’s budding newswoman, Mary Richards, was showing once a week that a spunky singleton with an M on her wall could make it after all surrounded by warm friends in frigid Minneapolis on “The Mary Tyler Moore Show.”They were both independent women, but they weren’t “liberated.”And then there was “Maude,” in 1972, and no one, except perhaps the series’s creator, the TV pioneer Norman Lear, had ever spent his Tuesday nights with a woman like her. Based in part on Mr. Lear’s flamboyantly opinionated wife, Frances, Maude Findlay was an eardrum-shattering, upper-middle-class liberal from Tuckahoe, N.Y., who popped tranquilizers, drank martinis and changed husbands as often as she changed her signature maxi-vests.With her voluptuous adult daughter, Carol, a divorcée played by Adrienne Barbeau, and her precocious grandson sharing her comfortable suburban home, Maude didn’t turn the world on with her smile, as Mary Richards did, but instead with one fatal look could wither her Republican neighbor, Arthur (Conrad Bain). Maude’s oft-repeated deep-voiced warning to her beleaguered fourth husband (Bill Macy), “God’ll get you for that, Walter,” was deadly compared with Ann Marie’s exasperated cry to her milquetoast boyfriend, “Oh, Donald.” Maude was the kind of woman who would threaten to rip even her grandson’s heart out if he disobeyed her.Running for six seasons — and riotously funny for almost as long — “Maude” unleashed on television the formidable Bea Arthur, a Broadway actress whose boozy Vera Charles in the musical “Mame” is the stuff of theater legend. Ms. Arthur appeared as Edith Bunker’s left-wing cousin Maude on a 1971 episode of Mr. Lear’s first hit, “All in the Family,” and made such an impression with audiences that, as the story goes, the CBS programming executive Fred Silverman suggested a spinoff as fast as the producers could get it on the air.'"
"'07-04-22,'0','The ambulance came, and Dr. Levine went along.His wife, Jill, was at home, with their younger son, Josh, running a Cub Scout meeting, when a neighbor came over. “She told me Robbie collapsed,” Ms. Levine recalls. “I figured he fainted.”Friends stayed with Josh, then 6, and his 6-month-old sister, Samantha. Josh told everyone Robbie was just dehydrated.“On the way,” Ms. Levine says, “I kept asking, ‘Is it going to be O.K.?’ My friend said, ‘It’s really bad.’ ”Ms. Levine saw her husband waiting in the hospital parking lot.“I don’t think he’s going to be O.K.,” he told his wife. “His heart stopped. I think he died.”Today, Dr. Levine says, “I knew he was dead, as soon as we got into the ambulance. I knew on the ball field he wasn’t going to wake up. And then you sit in that room and they tell you, ‘We tried everything.’ ”Robbie Levine was pronounced dead about 8 p.m. By 10 his parents were home.“I don’t think we slept for a few days, just looking at the ceiling wondering how,” Dr. Levine says. Besides grief, there was anger. Could Robbie have been saved if there had been a defibrillator at the field, immediately available?This would become his parents’ cause. “It became my main focus, my coping mechanism,” says Ms. Levine, who was a social worker before staying home with the kids.They wanted Robbie buried beside his grandfather and were told there was no room in the plot. They found themselves demanding in ways they never had before. “I kept saying, ‘He can’t be by himself,’ ” Ms. Levine says. The cemetery relented.“People ask, ‘How do you get up in the morning?’ ” Ms. Levine says. “I had a 6-month-old daughter. I had no choice. We needed to live our life, be the normal family we are. You don’t want Josh growing up saying, ‘When I was 6, we were so screwed up, we never did anything.’ ”They saw a grief counselor. “I went for two sessions and cried my eyes out,” Dr. Levine says. “She told me what I’m feeling is normal. So why did I need to go?”They have consulted several medical experts about what caused Robbie’s heart failure, but 18 months later they still don’t know. It’s more than just a need to understand. Could it be genetic? Could it affect their other children? Sudden cardiac death is extremely rare: According to the American Academy of Family Physicians, it kills 1 in 200,000 young athletes a year.Robbie’s death was particularly puzzling. Three months earlier, he’d complained of dizziness at a baseball practice, and the Levines had taken him to a pediatric cardiologist. Robbie was given an electrocardiogram and, at the mother’s insistence, an echocardiogram.“They acted like I was this crazy mother,” she says. “The doctor said: ‘He has the healthiest heart I’ve ever seen. I never want to see him back.’ ”Robbie’s episode of dizziness and his heart failure came when he was physically active. The Levines wondered if a stress test would have detected a problem. Between Robbie’s visit to the cardiologist and his death, he was constantly playing sports. Had there been other times he had felt dizzy and did not say so? “You tell a 9-year-old not to worry,” his father says. “Maybe he felt it and figured, ‘The doctor says I’m fine.’ ”They have thought of suing, but have taken no action while they try to find answers.They’ve sent the 27-page autopsy report to a pediatric cardiologist and a pediatric pathologist. Those experts did not pinpoint a cause and recommended other experts.Robbie’s brother seemed perfectly healthy, but as a precaution, the Levines took him to a new cardiologist. “We said, ‘Treat Josh as if he was Robbie,’ ” Ms. Levine recalls. The 6-year-old had an EKG, an echocardiogram and a stress test and wore a heart monitor for 24 hours. All the results were fine.And all the while, the Levines have worked at getting back to normal. Two weeks before Robbie died they had bought a new kitchen table at Macy’s. “At the store, we sat around the table to see if five chairs would fit,” Dr. Levine says.They felt it might be a mistake not to fill that fifth chair again.Six months ago, a second daughter, Rylie, was born.A million things make them remember Robbie. “You see a couple with three kids, you wonder if they lost a kid, too,” Dr. Levine says. “I see a patient who’s 9, I think, ‘That’s how old Robbie was.’ I see one who’s 11, I think, ‘That’s how old he’d be.’ ”Josh is now 8. His parents believe he is doing fine. “He doesn’t have behavior issues, he does well in school, he’s a happy child,” Ms. Levine says.Around Josh, they try not to dwell on Robbie, but mention him when it seems right. His dad coaches Josh’s Rookie League team. “I’ll say, ‘Do you think Robbie would have loved this game?’ ” Dr. Levine says. “And Josh says: ‘I was thinking about him a lot today.’ He knows he’s missing.”On April 29, in Merrick, the Levines will hold their second 5K race to raise money for the Robbie Levine Foundation. Last year they raised $35,000. Because of the foundation, there are now defibrillators at all 10 Little League fields in Merrick, stored in sheds along with the bases and ice packs. Every coach takes a three-hour training course in defibrillator use. The foundation has also made a DVD about Robbie in hopes that youth programs elsewhere will do what Merrick has done.While public health experts I interviewed say the $1,500 each defibrillator costs might be better spent for vaccinations against diseases that kill more children, like meningitis or influenza, the Levines say if one of their defibrillators saves one child, that would be sufficient.“If it’s your child,” Ms. Levine says, “it’s your whole world.”'"
"'07-04-22,'0','In 1773, patriots in Boston protested Britain’s stranglehold over the tea trade by tipping 342 crates of Chinese leaves into the harbor. The British had been trying desperately to offset the costs of purchasing this valuable commodity from Canton, where China had imposed its own unfavorable trading terms. Tea was the lifeblood of the East India Company, but by the late 18th century, it had begun to drain the beast it was supposed to nourish. Kate Teltscher’s marvelous new book, “The High Road to China,” lucidly relates how Britain tried to circumvent trade barriers by opening a back door to China through the mysterious land of Tibet.It was with this aim that in 1774 Warren Hastings, the governor of Bengal, sent his private secretary, George Bogle, to the remote Buddhist monastery of the third Panchen Lama, Lobsang Palden Yeshe. Bogle’s route took him into some of the world’s toughest terrain, over flooded ravines in Bhutan and across Tibet’s icy plateaus. But these were the least of his obstacles: he also had to scale the daunting barriers of cultural understanding. Communication was actively hindered by agents of the Qianlong emperor in Peking, who claimed Tibet as a dependency and spurned the meddling of traders from an island of “lonely remoteness ... cut off from the world by intervening wastes of sea.” Besides, as the Dalai Lama’s regent warned, the British were warlike and treacherous. When the Panchen Lama finally permitted Bogle to enter Tibet, he was risking relations with his Chinese overlords; he was also exposing his country to a notorious band of rascals.What could have motivated this rash invitation? While Bogle was intent on trade agreements, the Panchen Lama was eager to forge a pilgrim path to the Buddhist holy lands in India: “I wish,” he told Bogle, “to have a place on the banks of the Ganges, to which I might send my people to pray.” At the heart of Teltscher’s book is the friendship that — according to Bogle — grew up between himself and the Panchen Lama. Despite the paucity of Tibetan sources, there is enough in Bogle’s papers for Teltscher to claim that their relationship “stands out in the history of encounters between Europeans and non-Europeans because it was neither violent nor exploitative.” Both Bogle and the Panchen Lama “were eager to cultivate each other, both were equally keen to learn.”Teltscher’s 1995 book, “India Inscribed,” a study of 17th- and 18th-century British and European writing on India, emphasized how explorations of Eastern cultures, like Sir William Jones’s study of Sanskrit, were carried out with the sinister aim of gaining mastery over colonial subjects. There was little room in that strict reading, inspired by the work of Edward Said, for the idea that genuine scholarly fascination could subsist as an end in itself alongside imperial ambitions. Britain’s tentative position in Tibet at the time differed from its dominant role in Bengal, but “The High Road to China” also signals a shift in Teltscher’s general attitude. Even while working for an unjust colonial machine, many individuals fostered similarly paradoxical relationships that became the channels for mutual cultural exchange.But the ironies, as Teltscher shows, run deep. Britain’s ambition of opening up the Chinese market was finally realized through violence, with the Opium Wars of 1839-42 and 1856-60. Francis Younghusband, who traveled to Tibet in 1903, saw himself as Bogle’s diplomatic successor even while leading a British invasion that massacred 500 Tibetans in a single encounter. Teltscher deftly laces her narrative with insights into Tibet’s modern predicament, and Bogle’s journey becomes a conduit for reflecting how a caffeine addiction that many of us still share was a potent force in shaping global trade.'"
"'07-04-22,'0','“They’re engaging Ogilvy & Mather to do their advertising. They’re using McKinsey for their strategy,” he says. “There’s been a very big shift in the ability to obtain knowledge that once would have been very slow to build up.”Estimates of the number of these new multinationals vary considerably. Mr. van Agtmael’s book identifies 25 of them. A study from the Boston Consulting Group last year named 100. Accenture, the consulting firm, says that there were 62 emerging-market multinationals in the Fortune Global 500 in 2005, up from 20 in 1995; it predicts that the number may hit 100 within 10 years.Not all the would-be competitors will be successful, of course. Mr. van Agtmael acknowledges that some will have to learn to focus on a few core areas where they truly excel, rather than engaging in a broad mix of activities as they have done at home. Western multinationals also have advantages in distribution, logistics and branding.But clearly, enough of these new companies will succeed that Americans will feel it, with both positive and negative results. On the positive side for consumers, most of these companies have low cost structures and will be able to offer their goods and services at lower prices.But there will be some pain as well. “A lot of people who felt that their companies or their jobs were protected because they were in the high-value-added or high-tech kinds of businesses used to think that the rise of these companies was irrelevant to them,” Professor Williamson said, referring to fields like architecture, design and pharmaceuticals. “But now they are going to find they are under significant competition from these companies. Their companies are going to face competitors providing pretty much the same level of technology or design competence at a quarter or 20 percent of their price.”That means American companies will have to look at their own operations with a “zero base mentality,” says William D. Green, chief executive of Accenture. Companies that don’t design business models that are competitive with those of the emerging multinationals will simply be blown away, he says.THE emerging giants have different strategies, reflecting their strengths, says Harold L. Sirkin, senior vice president of the Boston Consulting Group, based in Chicago, and co-author of its 2006 study. Some, particularly the Chinese companies, have mainly used cheap labor to undercut established companies. The emerging multinationals haven’t had time to establish brand names, as Sony or LG have done, but they will compensate for that. “They are either going to buy American companies and use their brands or develop their own brand names,” says Mr. Sirkin, who regularly consults in China and India.Others, like Embraer of Brazil have learned to exploit a local base of excellent but low-cost engineering talent. Companies like Johnson Electric, which is based in Hong Kong and has the capacity to produce three million motors a day, have strong positions in a global product niche. And Russian companies have leveraged their natural-resource wealth to set up distribution channels and make acquisitions in the West.Mr. Sirkin says that over the long run, the entry of the new multinationals into the United States market will be a “bigger deal” than the previous arrival of Japanese or Korean businesses, if only because countries as big as China and India are likely to spawn many important companies. “We’ll see the next Toyota coming from China and the next Samsung coming from India,” he says.The new multinationals represent a far more complex phenomenon than a surge of imported products, which can be blocked or reduced by tariffs and quotas, experts say. These companies will be buying assets, and while political disputes may block some deals, as in the case of a Dubai group aiming to buy American ports or of Haier trying to buy Maytag, there doesn’t seem to be any stopping of the broader trend.The emerging multinationals will also be building new plants in the United States and offering services and products that are in great demand, like the I.B.M. personal computers now made and sold by Lenovo.But Mr. Sirkin is optimistic that the United States economy will continue to flourish. “There are a lot of imports coming in from China today, but what’s our unemployment rate?” he said. “It isn’t 43 percent. We’ve responded.”'"
"'07-04-22,'0','Nowhere to go in the fall? Keep applying. Call it late decision.Bad application choices (oops, Barnard is not a safety school) can result in the unthinkable: nowhere to go to college in the fall, or nowhere you want to go. “Every year we get reports from our school counselors of panicked students who have not gotten into the colleges of their choice,” says David Hawkins, director of public policy for the National Association for College Admission Counseling. Other students come down with senioritis, and the college they planned to attend won’t take them (see here for how this can happen). Still others need to rethink their options because their lives have changed: you can’t go to school in California if a sick parent needs you in New York.Luckily, colleges get rejected, too. Fewer admitted applicants than desirable may reserve places. Institutions also experience “summer melt”: in June and July, students cancel for a host of reasons, including the shock of that first tuition bill.So colleges may be interested in applicants after May 1, the day most enrollment deposits are due.Where do you find colleges with room late in the game? A good source is the annual Space Availability Survey on the admissions association Web site, www.nacacnet.org, as of May 7. Last year, 186 four-year colleges, including the University of Pittsburgh, Fordham and Mills College, reported slots. The list, dominated by private colleges accepting 50 to 85 percent of applicants, is updated until August.Not all colleges respond to the survey, so call the admissions office. Important: Your mom cannot make these calls. “The student must take ownership over the situation,” says Dennis Craig, vice president for admissions at Purchase College, part of the State University of New York. Colleges are wary of late applicants, he says; parental involvement “gives us even less confidence.”When an admissions officer gives you the go-ahead, send everything regular applicants submit plus a statement explaining how you ended up in your predicament. Expect to hear in a matter of days to a few weeks.'"
"'07-04-22,'0','And the state treasurer, Bradley I. Abelow, testified before the Assembly’s budget committee about accounting practices used in the state pension fund prior to the Corzine administration.People tend to forget that a big part of the governor’s job description is performing ceremonial or constitutional functions. That means waving to residents at parades on Main Street, delivering speeches to trade associations, reading to children in schools and libraries.Then there is the sheer volume of political commitments. As the only elected statewide official, at least until the office of the lieutenant governor is created, the governor is also the titular head of his or her party. There are always county chairmen and chairwomen to appease, new mayors to meet, national candidates to raise money for. Not to mention the endless opportunities for political dinners on any given evening.Since the medical experts were saying late last week that Mr. Corzine would have limited mobility for some time, he could decline requests that might have been impolite for him to reject before.If so, he might be able to turn his full attention to the central issues that he cares deeply about, like the leasing of toll roads, a new school financing formula or universal health care.“As the governor is rehabilitating, I believe he will be in charge,” said William G. Dressel Jr., executive director of the New Jersey State League of Municipalities, and a 30-year veteran of Trenton politics. “In fact he will probably have more time to spend on policy with the less demanding schedule he will have.”In a typical election year for the Legislature — like 2007 — almost half of a governor’s time could be spent on political activities like fund-raisers and postdinner rallies, said Carl Golden, a former spokesman for Governors Thomas H. Kean and Christie Whitman.Another 20 percent, perhaps, could be devoted to ceremonial activities with a dash of policy, like a ribbon-cutting event at a local school that also happens to mention an educational goal. That does not leave much time for the nitty-gritty of state business, and focusing on policies and legislative initiatives, Mr. Golden said.“He can conduct business without being distracted by something like, ‘I have to leave this budget meeting because I have to meet with six county chairmen in Cape May,’ ” he said. “But he has to be careful, as he does that, to not create a perception that he’s ceding some of the power of the office.”Consider, for instance, Governor Corzine’s packed schedule on April 12, the day of his auto accident on the Garden State Parkway.First, he attended the funeral of a Federal Bureau of Investigation agent in Pottstown, Pa. Then he brokered a peace between two rival Democratic camps in Hackensack. Then, he had two events in Atlantic City, including a speech to members of the New Jersey Conference of Mayors. Last up was a meeting at Drumthwacket between the former talk-show radio host Don Imus and the Rutgers women’s basketball team.Of all those events, you could argue that the only one he had to attend was the funeral. For the Bergen County announcement, perhaps he could have dispatched Assemblyman Joseph Cryan, the state Democratic party chairman? For the others, perhaps a cabinet official or other surrogate, like Mr. Codey, may have sufficed?Of course, Corzine administration officials may be reluctant to rely too much on Mr. Codey. While Mr. Corzine and Mr. Codey have been allies on many issues since Mr. Corzine took office in January 2006, it does not make political sense for the Corzine camp to give the New Jersey public even more of a reason to love Mr. Codey, the state’s most popular politician.'"
"'07-04-22,'0','Prisbillig — that's the Danish word for cheap. Unfortunately, it's a word seldom heard in this Nordic city. One culprit is the powerful krone (or weak dollar). Another is the city's skyrocketing style quotient. An explosion of high-end hangouts and high-style buildings by name-brand architects — including Daniel Libeskind, Jean Nouvel, Zaha Hadid, Henning Larsen and Norman Foster — have helped make the Danish capital one of the planet's 10 most expensive cities.Where to Stay for Under 125 EurosThe rooms at the Absalon Hotel (Helgolandsgade 15; 45-33-24-22-11; www.absalonhotel.dk) may be a beige mix of bland carpeting and floral fabrics. But its unbeatable location — in hip Vesterbro and just steps from Central Station and the Tivoli amusement park — puts the Absalon a cut above its lower-cost competitors. Throw in extras like Wi-Fi and breakfast, and you have the makings of a decent Danish deal. For travelers on a very tight budget, the hotel's annex (simpler rooms, shared bathrooms) is an even better value. Doubles in the annex start at 790 kroner, about $144 at 5.6 Danish kroner to $1, or 106 euros (the Internet rate is 710 kroner). Standard hotel doubles start at 1,360 kroner (Internet rate, 1,195 kroner).Why seek out French fare in Scandinavia? Because the gastronomic philanthropists at Les Trois Cochons (Vaernedamsvej 10; 45-33-31-70-55; www.cofoco.dk) are executing it with zest — and thrift. Housed in a former butcher shop (you can still spy the checkerboard tile floors and window-pane cabinets), this two-year-old nouveau bistro offers impeccable three-course meals for just 250 kroner. The seasonal menu, which changes monthly, recently included French-infused Danish dishes like halibut in mussel broth, beef with mushrooms in red-wine sauce, and roasted suckling pig with carrots, onions and mustard.Don't be fooled by the Italian name. Vero Moda (Ostergade 7-9; 45-33-15-88-15; www.veromoda.com) — Copenhagen's answer to budget retailers like H&M and Zara — is thoroughly Danish. Racks brim with bright tops, slim jeans and other trendy fashions for nightclubbers and hipsters who are making do without Daddy's trust fund. (“Sell more at lower prices” is the store's philosophy.) This year's spring collection unfurls retro-chic 1950s styles that would make Tuesday Weld and Audrey Hepburn proud. Must-haves — all for under $100 — include black ruffled corsage dresses (199.95 kroner), scoop-neck baby-doll dresses (259.95 kroner) and shiny silvery purses (129.95 kroner).Follow the sound of camera clicks to Copenhagen's most photographed celebrity: the statue of the Little Mermaid. She sits on a rock just offshore from Langeline, a harborside street next to the rampart-surrounded Kastellet. Across town, in the Norrebro district, join the picnickers and sunbathers at the leafy expanses of Assistens Kirkegaard. The picturesque cemetery holds the graves of the Mermaid's creator, Hans Christian Andersen, and the existentialist philosopher Soren Kierkegaard. And neither charges a dime.'"
"'07-04-22,'0','This makes for particularly Roman paradoxes, like the one that faces Alberto Tarquini, an Italian teacher: He is both an agnostic and a dedicated visitor of churches, for all that they say about art and the history of the city that he tirelessly wanders.“Good Lord, it's beautiful,” he said as he poked his head into the Basilica of San Clemente, a small treasure near the Colosseum that defies any easy description.The spot has been inhabited for some 22 centuries, and visitors can see the layers rising from buildings destroyed in the fire of Nero's time to an old temple to a Persian religion that made it to Rome, Mithraism, to the Christian church built on top as if to physically dominate it.The apse's 12th-century mosaics are stunning, in marble, gold and tile, with birds and deer embellishing religious themes. Then there are more than eight centuries of frescoes, interesting on their own, but to connoisseurs like Mr. Tarquini, tantalizing as a document of the evolution of art. “It's all of history,” Mr. Tarquini said. It is speculated — but never proven — that the 15th-century artist Masaccio, a transitional figure from decorative Gothic to more humanistic Renaissance painting, had a hand in some of the figures otherwise painted by his friend Masolino.Perhaps less esoteric, but no less satisfying, is the church tour of the Michelangelos.Not far from San Clemente is the basilica of St. Peter's in Chains. There sits Michelangelo Buonarroti's Moses, part of the massive tomb he famously never completed for Pope Julius II. Legend has it that Michelangelo struck the knee of his completed creation in stone, otherwise so lifelike, with a hammer.The church of Santa Maria Sopra Minerva, next to the Pantheon, houses what is considered a lesser sculpture of Christ by Michelangelo. Then there is, of course, St. Peter's Basilica, which on its own owes much to Michelangelo. (Unlike the Vatican Museums, entrance to the basilica is free.) Behind bulletproof glass (thanks to an attack on it in 1972) rests the Pietà, completed when the artist was just 24 years old.Less sought out, but no less deserving, are the six works by the man sometimes known as “the other Michelangelo” (the phrase is used as a chapter heading of a new entertaining meditation on Rome that tourists might consider, “The Secrets of Rome,” just published in English by Rizzoli). Michelangelo Merisi is usually known simply as Caravaggio (born a century after the other Michelangelo), and his paintings decorate churches in central Rome, including San Luigi dei Francesi, at Piazza San Luigi dei Francesi, near Piazza Navona, and the nearby Church of Sant'Agostino.The book's author, Corrado Augias, one of Italy's best-known writers, agreed to a quick tour of the third Caravaggio church, Santa Maria del Popolo, at the northern end of Piazza del Popolo. The paintings there are interesting for the subject matter — two of Christianity's founders, St. Paul and St. Peter — and for the way they are executed: Caravaggio's craggy-footed realism contrasts with the airy, devotional style much in demand by the Vatican then, summed up in another painting in the same chapel, Annibale Carracci's “Assumption of the Virgin.” “His realism is a realism that amazed, surprised and frightened,” Mr. Augias said.Mr. Augias also makes the point that all of Rome is a museum. Little is more satisfying as merely wandering, bumping into examples of how human beings decided to decorate 2,500 years of history. My own favorite, I'm afraid, is not very highbrow: Bernini's pudgy elephant with an over-long trunk that sits at the square in front of Santa Maria Sopra Minerva. Bernini was devout, and supposedly did not care for secular work like this. “How ashamed I am to have done so poorly,” he reportedly said while passing his majestic Fountain of Four Rivers in Piazza Navona. He might, somewhere, take heart that it can't be seen very well at the moment. It is under renovation, very likely through the end of the year.Most visitors to Rome inevitably think in terms of Classical art and architecture, but there are also contemporary alternatives. The ambitious new Maxxi, or the National Museum of the XXI Century Arts, is free, and the current exhibition space is only a fraction of what is projected, in a vast modern building under construction by the London-based architect Zaha Hadid.Hers is one of several modern buildings, at once welcomed and loathed in this most traditional city — along with Richard Meier's building for the Ara Pacis Museum and Renzo Piano's Rome Auditorium. Since it opened in 2002, the Auditorium has become a major cultural center of the city, and it is worth checking for exhibitions, concerts and films offered regularly for free.Modern art exhibitions tend to take place in small, informal galleries spread around the city. “Artists don't meet in museums,” said Cornelia Lauf, a curator and art history professor here. “They don't go to places that look arty. They don't go to trendy mozzarella bars. They like real things.”One of Ms. Lauf's favorite galleries, called Monitor, is a few steps away from the Vatican. Another she recommends is in the former Jewish Ghetto, itself a must for visitors to Rome — it is Valentina Bonomo, where every few months a single artist designs an exhibition specifically for the space, in a former monastery that dates from the 14th century.With about 2,500 years of art everywhere, do modern artists feel overshadowed by the old? “I don't feel this as a weight,” said Luigi Ontani, one of Italy's top contemporary artists. “I feel it as a richness.” But the emphasis tends toward artists long dead, and certainly it is more difficult for visitors to track down the new, especially for free.Many of the free spaces for contemporary art are decidedly low-key. Mr. Ontani, for example, was talking below one of his works, a whimsical Murano glass chandelier whizzing with black birds. The exhibition space in the library of Incontri Internazionali d'Arte has room for precisely one work — at the moment his.Basilica of San Clemente, Via Labicana 95; (39-06) 77-40-021; www.basilicasanclemente.com.

"'07-04-22,'0','Booking on your own, of course, entails some risk. While HomeAway monitors customer feedback on rentals and typically bans properties that receive three complaints, listings are essentially advertisements, written by owners.Villas from rental agencies can cost anywhere from 5 percent to 20 percent more than rentals by owner because most owners pass on the cost of agents’ commissions. But for that premium, renters also generally get a bit more quality control. Interhome (www.interhome.us), one of the largest rental agencies in Europe, with nearly 20,000 properties in 19 countries, sends staff members to inspect the properties it lists. It also has more then 60 offices in Europe that can step in to help resolve problems or even locate a new rental if necessary.STAY OUT OF THE TUSCAN SUNWhile many Americans aspire to the archetypical villa vacation in Tuscany or the south of France, other regions can offer comparable cultural immersion at significant savings. “Tuscany is on our lips,” said Tim Roney, director of worldwide sales at LaCure Villas, which specializes in luxury rentals, but Umbria, from its cuisine to its rolling agricultural countryside and medieval stone villages, offers a very similar experience “at rates 40 and 60 percent below Tuscany prices.”In France, he said, properties in inland Provence are generally less expensive than those on the Mediterranean coast. For example, Villa d’Antibes, a nine-bedroom luxury home with a heated swimming pool and views of the bay of Cap d’Antibes near Cannes, rents for 35,940 euros a week in July and August from LaCure, or about $48,900 at $1.36 to the euro. By contrast, L’Monastère, an 11th-century monastery building with nine bedrooms, a chapel, a swimming pool and a tennis court, near Aix-en-Provence, goes for 16,200 euros ($22,000) a week.The Dalmatian Coast in Croatia, marketed by some travel companies as a new Riviera, has a Mediterranean climate and miles of beaches. The average weekly price for a four-bedroom summer rental there is $2,660 at HomeAway.com, compared with similar rentals on the Italian Riviera at $5,650 on average. “In addition to saving a few hundred dollars on their accommodation,” said Courtney Wylie, brand manager at Holiday-Rentals.co.uk, “they can also save money through a cheaper cost of living.”Off-season in Europe doesn’t always mean avoiding June, July and August. During the winter, Chamonix, France, is a draw for skiers. In summer rates go down but some lifts keep running to transport hikers, bikers and rock climbers to high-altitude adventures. For example, Chalet Villa Miremont, a three-bedroom chalet near the village center, drops to £1,000, or $2,000 at $2 to the pound, at HomeAway.com, from 1,450 to 1,650 pounds during the winter season.Of course the best deals are in the spring and fall, when the crowds are gone for good. For just $850, Bob Grundstrom, a banker from Ventura, Calif., booked a three-bedroom Tuscan villa, including housekeeping services, from Rentvillas.com for a weeklong vacation with friends last October. Shared by the two couples, the cost was just $30 a day per person. By contrast, Mr. Grundstrom, who also traveled to Rome and London during his vacation, staying in hotels and bed-and-breakfasts, didn’t find anything there for less than $200 a night.“My concern was the price was so good I was afraid we’d get this shack,” he said of the Tuscan villa. “But we were pleasantly surprised. The place was wonderful.” On a farm surrounded by vineyards and olive groves in a hamlet of Chianti, the villa goes for about $1,200 a week, not including housekeeping, during peak summer months.Owners putting property up for rent for the first time or in a new market tend to offer lower prices, said Kevin Pidduck, chief executive of Rentvillas.com, whose listings include villas in Greece and Turkey. Finding such deals “does take a little work,” he said. “You either need to speak with someone or very carefully look through the inventory.” For a list of new properties from Rentvillas.com, click on Our Featured Properties, and then Recent Additions. One recent addition, Villa Sella, a three-bedroom house with a private swimming pool in Chianti, was listed at $2,761 a week in July and August to attract clients — about $300 less than Villa Certaldo, a comparable three-bedroom with a pool in the region. Another, Villa Amadora on Lake Maggiore, is priced at about $1,600 less than similar lake-view accommodations.Thanks to a development boom in Spain and Portugal, HomeAway.com listings by owners there have surged. Villa and apartment listings for Spain have nearly doubled, to 5,861 in January compared with those in the same month in 2005. Deals include 15 percent off a new three-bedroom villa in Alicante’s Costa Blanca in June and 25 percent off a two-week rental in June, July or August of five-bedroom Casa La Cuerda, in eastern Andalusia. In Portugal, where listings more than doubled to 1,440 in January over January 2005, there are similar deals.'"

"'07-04-23,'0','“The Wiccan families we represented were in no way asking for special treatment,” the Rev. Barry W. Lynn, executive director of Americans United, said at a news conference today. “They wanted precisely the same treatment that dozens of other religions already had received from the department, an acknowledgment that their spiritual beliefs were on par with those of everyone else.”A Veterans Affairs spokesman, Matt Burns, confirmed that the “V.A. will be adding the pentacle to its list of approved emblems of belief that will be engraved on government-provided markers.“The government acted to settle in the interest of the families concerned,” he added, “and to spare taxpayers the expense of further litigation.”In reviewing 30,000 pages of documents from Veterans Affairs, Americans United said it found e-mails and memoranda referring to negative comments that President Bush made about Wicca during a 1999 interview with the ABC program “Good Morning America,” when he was governor of Texas. The interview had to do with a controversy at the time about Wiccan soldiers being allowed to worship at Fort Hood in Texas.“I don’t think witchcraft is a religion,” Mr. Bush said at the time, according to a transcript. “ I would hope the military officials would take a second look at the decision they made.”Americans United did not assert that the White House influenced the Veterans Affairs Department. Under the terms of the settlement, Americans United had to return the documents and could not copy them, although the group could make limited comments about their contents, Mr. Katskee said.Americans United filed the lawsuit last November on behalf of several Wiccan military families. Among the plaintiffs was Roberta Stewart, whose husband, Sgt. Patrick Stewart, was killed in September 2005 in Afghanistan.Ms. Stewart said that until the lawsuit was filed, she had tried various avenues to get the pentacle approved. Finally, Gov. Kenny Guinn of Nevada, her home state, approved the placing of a marker with a pentacle in a Veterans Affairs cemetery in Fernley. But Ms. Stewart said she continued to pursue the lawsuit because she wanted the federal government to approve the markers.Other religious groups that have often opposed Americans United supported the effort to have the federal government approve the pentacle.“I was just aghast that someone who would fight for their country and die for their country would not get the symbol he wanted on his gravestone,” said John W. Whitehead, president of the Rutherford Institute, which litigates many First Amendment cases. “It’s just overt religious discrimination.”'"
"'07-04-23,'0','“We made some real headway in clearing up some misunderstanding about the technical characteristics of the system that are of concern to the Russians,” Mr. Gates said.“The key to this is cooperation,” he added. “We would like to have the Russians as partners in this process. We would like to share information with them. We are prepared to co-locate radars with them.”A joint missile defense effort offers “some real opportunity here for both sides,” Mr. Gates said. “And that involves a great deal of transparency on our part — and we are prepared to do that.”In one specific action growing out of today’s talks, the two sides agreed to order a group of Russian and American government and military experts to address the Kremlin’s questions and concerns on the American antimissile system formally, Mr. Gates said.“I think there are some misunderstandings about some of the technical characteristics of the radar that would be involved, about the interceptors and some of their capabilities,” he said.Mr. Gates said he invited Russian officials to visit the current American missile defense site in Alaska, and see the non-explosive interceptors that are similar to the 10 proposed for location in Poland. And he likewise invited Russian officials to inspect the American missile tracking radar in California, which is similar to one proposed for the Czech Republic.Separately, senior administration officials have said that, with the permission of the Polish and Czech governments, the Russian officials also would be allowed routine inspection of any eventual American missile defense bases on those territories to help quiet Moscow’s concerns that the sites could be used for offensive weapons.The invitations for cooperation laid out to the Russian government, Mr. Gates said, “went well beyond anything anybody had seen before in terms of details and scope of what we are talking about.”In addition to meeting with the new Russian defense minister, Mr. Gates also had talks with President Vladimir V. Putin and with Sergei B. Ivanov, the first deputy prime minister who previously served as minister of defense.Although he expressed the expected cautious optimism about the way ahead, Mr. Gates did not deny that significant gaps exist in American and Russian perceptions of the Iranian threat and, therefore, over the real purpose of the proposed missile defense sites in Central Europe.The Russians, Mr. Gates said, remained skeptical that Iran would have an intercontinental ballistic missile capable of hitting all of Europe in the foreseeable future.But, as a former director of the Central Intelligence Agency, Mr. Gates said, he learned that it is a “risky assessment” to plan national security policy on assumptions that Middle Eastern states will not gain such military capabilities in the next 10 to 20 years.Mr. Gates’ arrival in Moscow early today illustrated the importance the Bush administration now places on calming Kremlin fears about missile defense. These fears have threatened to rupture relations between the United States and Russia and have greatly worried NATO allies.Mr. Gates had received a dramatic invitation for a visit, delivered by Mr.Putin, while the two men were attending an international security conference in Munich earlier this year.During his conference address, the Russian president, who is a former senior Soviet intelligence officer, gave an unexpectedly caustic analysis of American foreign policy, including a harsh critique of America missile defenses, but concluded by walking across the conference hall to Mr. Gates’ table, and inviting the American defense secretary to come to talk to him in Russia.In the weeks since then, rising tensions with Moscow over missile defense reached such levels of concern among top Bush administration officials that Mr. Gates moved his tentative visit up from the fall. Less than 48 hours after a grueling trip to Iraq, the defense secretary was back aboard his command airplane for the flight to Moscow on Sunday.Mr. Gates has visited Russia only once before, in October of 1992, when he became the first director of the Central Intelligence Agency ever to set foot on the soil of America’s cold war adversary.During that visit, he met with former President Boris N. Yeltsin, and toured Ysenevo, the suburban headquarters of the KGB First Chief Directorate, the spy agency’s foreign intelligence section.'"
"'07-04-23,'0','Mr. Hirchson denies any wrongdoing, his lawyer, Yaakov Weinrot, told Army Radio on Sunday.Mr. Hirchson issued a statement on Sunday afternoon saying that his “public responsibility” and his “conscience” were the deciding factors in his decision to suspend himself, “as well as the recognition that my family members are the ones being harmed.”The resignation of Mr. Bishara, the Israeli Arab lawmaker, followed a period of feverish speculation in Israel about his whereabouts and intentions. Mr. Bishara, whose party has three seats in the 120-seat Parliament, has been abroad under mysterious circumstances since early April. Until last week, a court order prevented publication of the fact that he was under investigation.While not revealing anything about the investigation, Mr. Bishara told Al Jazeera Arabic television on April 15 that he had been questioned by the police twice before leaving the country. Mr. Bishara, whose aides have said he is a victim of a political witch hunt, told the Arabic news media that his options were to become “a martyr, a prisoner or an exile.”He is being investigated by the International Crimes Unit of the police, which deals with serious crimes committed either at home or abroad, the police spokesman said.Mr. Bishara has been interrogated by the police in the past, after visiting Syria, a country that does not have normal diplomatic relations with Israel. Israeli critics consider his political positions a threat to the future character of the country; Mr. Bishara rejects Israel’s definition of itself as a Jewish state and has called for it to become a “state of all its citizens.” That idea has gained popularity in recent years among the Arab minority, which makes up almost 20 percent of Israel’s population, and among Israel’s Arab political and intellectual leadership.Shortly after Israel’s war against Hezbollah in Lebanon last summer, Mr. Bishara and two other Balad members of Parliament traveled to Syria and Lebanon to express their solidarity with the other side. Mr. Bishara had openly opposed Israel’s decision to go to war. According to Syrian news reports at the time, he warned Damascus of what he said were Israeli plans to attack Syria in order to restore Israel’s deterrent capability.The Israeli daily newspaper Maariv reported in September that Mr. Bishara had “violated a relatively new law forbidding travel to an enemy country without the approval of the minister of the interior.” The paper said that the attorney general was considering opening a criminal investigation.An official in Jerusalem familiar with the allegations against Mr. Bishara suggested that the investigation that had apparently prompted his resignation was not connected with the trip to Syria and Lebanon.Although the court-ordered silence about the investigation of Mr. Bishara was due to expire on Monday, the court on Sunday extended the order until Wednesday.Separately, Israeli troops killed two militants in the West Bank city of Nablus during an operation to arrest them early Sunday morning, Israeli security officials said. The security officials said the two had died in an exchange of fire, and that one, Amin Lubadeh, was a leading bomb maker associated with a militia affiliated with Fatah.Palestinian medical officials also confirmed the death of a Palestinian youth, Karim Zahran, 16, who was shot by Israeli troops on Sunday in a village northeast of Ramallah. According to an Israeli Army spokesman, soldiers had been confronted by dozens of Palestinians, “some of whom were holding firebombs and knives.”Up to nine Palestinians died in an upsurge of Israeli-Palestinian violence over the weekend. A Hamas spokesman in Gaza, Fawzi Barhoum, urged the Palestinian factions to unite and use “all means to retaliate” against Israel.'"
"'07-04-23,'0','“I think there were a lot of people that did a lot of good things at the right time,” said Lou Lamoriello, the Devils’ general manager and interim coach.One of those people, naturally, was Brodeur. His excellence in the postseason is such a given that Devils fans must have been concerned when he allowed 12 goals in the first four games of the series.After shutting out the Lightning in Game 5 on Friday, Brodeur finished with 32 saves Sunday, one more than on Friday.He made 10 stops in the final 20 minutes, when the Lightning played like a desperate team.Brodeur’s third-period flourish included a glove save of a slap shot by Ryan Craig, a stop of defenseman Filip Kuba on a backdoor play that the Lightning had used with great effectiveness the first three games, and three point-blank shots in the closing minutes, one by Richards and two by Martin St. Louis.“He was phenomenal the other night,” Devils defenseman Richard Matvichuk said, referring to Brodeur’s performance Friday, “and I think he was even better today.”The same could be said of Matvichuk, for whom little was expected at the start of the series. He had back surgery in June and did not return until the Devils’ final regular-season game. After not dressing in the first two games against the Lightning, Matvichuk was thrust into action in Game 3, when Colin White’s balky back prevented him from playing.Matvichuk was paired with Paul Martin, who logged more than 30 minutes Sunday. Together, they did a laudable job of curtailing, if not containing, the Lightning’s top goal scorer, Vincent Lecavalier, and his right-hand man, St. Louis.In the game’s first minute, Matvichuk threw his body in front of a Lecavalier shot for the first of his six blocked shots. Lecavalier’s frustration at being covered like clear wrap got the better of him in the final minute of the first period. He struck Matvichuk in the back with his stick a couple feet in front of Brodeur.Matvichuk was slow to get up and looked wobbly on his skates as he headed straight for the dressing room.“It was just a little jolt of pain,” said Matvichuk, who returned to play 15 minutes over the next two periods.Lecavalier’s cross-checking penalty looked even worse when, in the second minute of the second, his teammate Jason Ward received a hooking penalty.In their 3-2 loss here in Game 3, the Devils had squandered a two-man advantage. That was before their power-play unit, led by Gomez, started playing as if the ice beneath their skates were cracking.In the final seconds of Lecavalier’s penalty, Gomez and Elias set up defenseman Brian Rafalski for his second goal of the series, extending the Devils’ lead to 2-0.Less than four minutes later, Richards broke up Brodeur’s bid for a league record-tying 23rd playoff shutout with a power-play goal, which ended the Lightning’s 123-minute scoring drought.Thirty-nine seconds later, the public-address announcer was just getting around to saying, in his booming voice, “Another power-play goal ... ” and inducing delirious cheering from the crowd of 20,019 when Gionta scored his second goal on feeds from Elias and Gomez.The goal, coming so quickly after the Lightning’s, gave the Devils a huge psychological lift. “No question about it,” Elias said.In the tense third period, the Devils could feel the momentum at their backs with every big save Brodeur made.Between Matvichuk’s locker and Gionta’s was a giant grease board with HUGE WIN scrawled in black letters. Gionta was answering questions about the game when the left side of the grease board detached from the nail holding it up.The board swung from the wall and toward Gionta’s head. “Watch it,” Matvichuk said, raising his voice only slightly, and Gionta calmly stepped aside in time to avoid being struck.It was one final catastrophe coolly averted in a series in which the final momentum swing belonged to the Devils.'"
"'07-04-23,'0','“We did get warning that the test was being prepared,” said a senior administration official, who described the administration’s thinking in deciding not to ask the Chinese to cancel the test.“I think it is fair to say that nobody knows whether the Chinese would have deferred or canceled the test,” the administration official added. “The principals’ best judgment, including the leadership of the intelligence community, was that they were committed to testing the antisatellite weapon.”But some experts outside government say that American officials might have been able to discourage the Chinese from launching the missile, had the officials been willing to enter into a broader discussion of ways to regulate the military competition in space. China had long advocated an agreement to ban weapons in space, an approach the Bush administration has rejected in order to maintain maximum flexibility for developing antimissile defenses.“Had the United States been willing to discuss the military use of space with the Chinese in Geneva, that might have been enough to dissuade them from going through with it,” said Jeffrey G. Lewis, an arms control expert at the New America Foundation.Dubbed the SC-19 by American intelligence, the Chinese antisatellite weapon consists of a solid-fuel medium-range missile carrying an interceptor that is designed to crash into enemy satellites. The weapon is fired from a mobile launcher.The United States had already detected two previous tests of the system — on July 7, 2005, and Feb. 6, 2006. Neither struck a target. In the second trial, the missile passed near a satellite, leaving American officials unsure whether the goal had been to hit it, or simply to pass nearby. In neither case did the Bush administration complain to the Chinese, a senior official said.In December 2006 and early January of this year, American intelligence agencies picked up signs that preparations for a third Chinese antisatellite test appeared to be under way. The mobile missile launcher for the SC-19 was repeatedly detected on the Songlin pad, according to American officials familiar with the classified reports.In early January, the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, which collects and analyzes reconnaissance information, also warned that an SC-19 test was possible that month, American officials said.The presumed target for the test was an old Chinese weather satellite known as the Feng-Yun-1C. The United States Air Force was carefully tracking the satellite on the day of the test, checking its location six times that day instead of the normal two, according to Geoff Forden, a research associate at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.As the test preparations were under way, the Bush administration pondered how to respond.“There were discussions about different options of how to deal with a potential test that was coming up, whether you démarche them early on, whether you wait to see if they are successful, if they’re not,” said Lt. Gen. Walter L. Sharp, the director of the staff under Gen. Peter Pace, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.General Sharp declined to provide details, but other officials said the idea of asking China to forgo the test had been broached by some Pentagon officials. The suggestion, they said, was rejected for several reasons.Officials concluded that China was unlikely to cancel the test and that there were few good options to punish China if they ignored an American warning to hold off. American intelligence agencies were loath to let the Chinese know they were aware of the state of their preparations.Meeting Chinese demands for a negotiation on space-based weapons was not considered an option for the administration. The United States last tested an antisatellite weapon — a missile that was fired into space from an F-15 warplane — in 1985, and has no current program to develop a new antisatellite system.With an eye on missile defense, however, the administration has sought to maintain maximum flexibility for American military operations in space. So the administration’s decision was to monitor China’s preparations and draft a protest that could be delivered after the test.Early on Jan. 11, the SC-19 was launched and rammed into the target satellite, which was orbiting 475 miles overhead. About 1,600 pieces of debris, the remnants of the destroyed satellite, have since been tracked orbiting the earth, increasing the danger of collisions with other spacecraft.An international meeting of government experts on space debris had been scheduled to open in Beijing this week, but was postponed by China, which apparently feared criticism of the January launching.But for the Pentagon, the national security implications are even more worrisome. As a result of the test, some American intelligence analysts concluded that the Chinese might have an operational antisatellite weapon that could threaten low-orbit American imaging satellites as early as next year.“There was a shock that the Russians had put a satellite in orbit before us,” Gen. T. Michael Moseley, the Air Force chief of staff, said at a recent conference, “and there’s a similar shock that the Chinese successfully shot down that satellite. It makes space astronomically more dangerous than it was before.”Several Pentagon officials said they believed that the purpose of the test was to give the Chinese military the ability to blind American imaging satellites and hamper American military operations if there were to be a confrontation over Taiwan.American officials said the United States could respond to the new threat by developing the ability to quickly launch new satellites and improving the network of space sensors to tell if a system has been disabled by a technical failure or by an enemy attack.Gen. James E. Cartwright, the head of the Strategic Command, said in recent Congressional testimony that another means of defending American satellites is to attack enemy launching pads with Trident submarine-launched missiles armed with non-nuclear warheads.While the Pentagon wants to field such a weapon, many lawmakers are wary, fearing that a potential adversary might mistake a non-nuclear Trident missile for the nuclear variant, triggering an inadvertent nuclear war.There is a vigorous debate among experts about whether the test might have been averted.“This was absolutely preventable,” said Joseph Cirincione of the Center for American Progress, a research group. “The Chinese have been proposing a treaty to ban weapons in space for years. We have refused in order to pursue this fantasy of space-based antimissile weapons.”Peter W. Rodman, who recently left his post as a senior Defense Department official, challenged that argument. “It is a bit of arms-control mythology that there is always a deal to be made,” Mr. Rodman said. “For years, the Chinese military has been writing about how to cripple a superpower that relies on high-tech capabilities like satellites. They have been patiently developing this capability. I don’t see why they would trade it away.”Mr. Lewis of the New America Foundation said that the United States might have persuaded the Chinese to defer the test, short of meeting their demand for a ban on space weapons.“The Bush administration watched them conduct two earlier tests and did not say a word,” he said. “Then they issued a National Space Policy that talked about freedom of action and denying adversaries access to space. The Chinese probably concluded that we were in no position to complain about their test.”John E. Pike, the director of Global Security.org, a military information Web site, has a less charitable view of the Chinese motivations. “It makes a mockery of China’s space weapons diplomacy,” he said. “Their proposals were always aimed at American space-based systems and always excluded a ground-based, pop-up antisatellite weapon such as theirs. I don’t think we could have talked them out of testing against a target.”The Bush administration is hoping that the diplomatic protests that it and other nations lodged after the SC-19 test will dissuade the Chinese from conducting additional tests. General Pace, however, had little luck in discussing China’s antisatellite program during a visit to China last month. “There were certain things that they were very open about, but they were not open about that,” he said.'"
"'07-04-23,'0','Saying America must be weaned from its reliance on foreign oil, Senator John McCain of Arizona is renewing his call for a cap on emissions of greenhouse gases as a way to fight global warming.In the text of a speech he is scheduled to deliver today in Washington, Mr. McCain said: “The problem isn’t a Hollywood invention nor is doing something about it a vanity of Cassandra-like hysterics. It is a serious and urgent economic, environmental and national security challenge.”Members of his campaign staff released excerpts of the speech yesterday, the last of three major addresses by Mr. McCain before the formal start later this week of his campaign for the Republican presidential nomination. The first speech focused on why he continued to support sending more troops to Iraq, and the second involved his economic proposals.“The world is already feeling the powerful effects of global warming,” the text of the speech set for today said, “and far more dire consequences are predicted if we let the growing deluge of greenhouse gas emissions continue, and wreak havoc with God’s creation.”Mr. McCain describes energy independence as a pressing national security issue. He warns that selling oil props up Iran, which he describes as “the No. 1 state sponsor of terrorism.” He says President Hugo Chávez of Venezuela is “using his country’s oil revenues to establish a dictatorship, bully his neighbors and succeed Castro as Latin America’s leading antagonist of the United States.”In one excerpt from the speech, he said, “National security depends on energy security, which we cannot achieve if we remain dependent on imported oil from Middle Eastern governments who support, or foment by their own inattention and inequities, the rise of terrorists, or on swaggering demagogues and would-be dictators in our hemisphere.”Mr. McCain, who has introduced legislation to lower carbon emissions, said that as president he would set “reasonable caps” on carbon and other greenhouse gas emissions, and would allow companies that reduced their emissions to earn credits that they could trade for a profit.'"

However, it has also been a stronghold of militant Sunni Arab groups, and the wall would have helped the Iraqi security forces to control their movements.Earlier on Sunday, the spokesman for the American military in Iraq sought to allay criticism of the project and explain its intent by saying that it was meant to be only a temporary barrier to improve security.The military does not have a new strategy of building walls or creating “gated communities,” the spokesman, Maj. Gen. William B. Caldwell IV, said in a written statement. He described it as a tactic being used in only a handful of neighborhoods and not an effort to divide the city, much less the country.However, American military officials said last week in a statement that the Adhamiya wall was “one of the centerpieces of a new strategy.” They also said that the wall was aimed at separating Sunni Arabs in Adhamiya from Shiites to the east.Opposition to the wall has gathered steam since the news release was issued, and on Sunday, Sunni Arab and Shiite groups sharply criticized the idea. The Sunni Arab Iraqi Islamic Party and the Shiite group linked to the anti-American cleric Moktada al-Sadr both announced that they opposed dividing Baghdad by sect. In sharp statements, they said the wall would increase sectarian hatred and fuel efforts to partition the country.“Surrounding areas of the capital with barbed wire and concrete blocks would harm these areas economically and socially,” the Islamic Party said in an e-mail message to news organizations. “In addition, it will enhance sectarian feelings.”Abu Firas al-Mutairi, a representative of the Sadr movement in Najaf, which has supported Mr. Maliki, said: “The Sadr movement considers building a wall around Al Adhamiya as a way to lay siege to the Iraqi people and to separate them into cantons. It is like the Berlin Wall that divided Germany.”“This step is the first step toward dividing the regions into cantons and blockading people there,” he added. “Today it happens in Adhamiya. Tomorrow it will happen in Sadr City,” referring to the Shiite slum in Baghdad that is a stronghold of Mr. Sadr.The wall, which was being built as part of the security plan, had been a joint project with the Iraqi Army. The Iraqi government has the final say over how the security plan proceeds, but most policies are being intensively negotiated with the Americans, who are deploying nearly 30,000 additional troops to help secure Baghdad and the surrounding areas.Mr. Maliki’s announcement came as sectarian violence continued across Iraq, with a horrific execution by Sunni Arabs in Mosul of 23 members of a small religious sect, known as Yezidis.The Yezidis, who are most numerous in the Kurdistan region of northern Iraq, practice an offshoot of Islam that combines some Muslim teachings with those of ancient Persian religion.At least 60 people died Sunday in Iraq, with 18 killed by car bombs in Baghdad. Eleven bodies were found in the capital and five in the city of Kut, to the south.But the most chilling attack was the one in Mosul. It followed the marriage in early April of a Sunni Arab man and a woman from the Yezidi faith, the police said.The police said that when the woman married, she converted to Islam, which angered some of the Yezidis. She was kidnapped and as she was being brought back to her tribe, a crowd gathered and stoned her to death, said Brig. Gen. Muhammad al-Waqa of the Mosul police.The Sunni Arabs in the area demanded that the Yezidis turn over the killers, and the police also put out a warrant for their arrest. In one Yezidi-majority town east of Mosul, residents found leaflets saying, “Unless you turn them over, we will never let any Yezidi breathe the air.”The Yezidis refused. On Sunday afternoon, armed men stopped minibuses traveling from a government textile factory in Mosul, where many Yezidis and Christians were known to work. The men dragged the passengers off the buses, checked their identity cards and lined the Yezidis up against a wall and shot them, killing 23 people and wounding three, General Waqa said.In Falluja, in Anbar Province, west of Baghdad, the City Council chairman, Sami al-Jumaili, was assassinated Sunday. He was the fifth council chairman in Falluja to lose his life while in the job since the war began. The militant group Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia has attacked those who work with the government, the police or the Iraqi Army in Anbar.A relative of Mr. Jumaili who spoke anonymously because he feared retribution described him as “an educated man who went to medical school.”“He accepted the job because he trusts people and wanted to help the city,” the relative said. “Many people refused the job. The family warned him that the job was dangerous. And, many of his predecessors had been killed. He answered that he had not harmed anyone.”The American military released a statement on Sunday saying two soldiers had been killed in separate attacks on Saturday, one in Baghdad and another southwest of the capital.'"
"'07-04-23,'0','LONDON, April 22 (AP) — Bangladesh’s former prime minister was blocked from boarding a flight home from London on Sunday after her country’s military-backed interim government barred her from returning.The former prime minister, Sheik Hasina Wazed, had vowed to go home from a private trip abroad to fight charges of corruption and abetting the killings of four protesters during riots. But last week, the Bangladesh government barred her return and asked airlines not to allow her on any flight to the country.“This is my country, and I don’t understand why they should stop me,” Sheik Hasina said in an interview after British Airways denied her a boarding pass at Heathrow Airport in London.“I want to face the case,” she said. “This is totally fake, false. I didn’t commit any murder, so it is absolutely false case, and that’s why I’m going to face it.”British Airways said it and other airlines were notified by the Civil Aviation Authority in Bangladesh that a passenger was barred from entering the country. “As a result we’re not able to accept them for travel,” the airline said in a statement, without elaborating.'"
"'07-04-23,'0','PRINCETON, N.J., April 20 — It is a rare musicological debate that quickly rises to broader public attention. Two classic examples in recent decades took place at conventions of the American Musicological Society in Boston, and both involved not only volatile issues but also combative personalities. In 1981 Joshua Rifkin and Robert Marshall locked horns over the size of Bach’s choruses, Mr. Rifkin arguing that Bach would typically have used only one singer per part. In 1998 bellicose defenders of the authenticity of the disputed claim that the book “Testimony” represented the actual “memoirs of Dmitri Shostakovich as related to and edited by Solomon Volkov” met with ferocious opposition from Richard Taruskin and others.A panel discussion of the American Handel Festival 2007 here on Friday certainly had an explosive issue: Michael Marissen’s thesis that “Messiah” and more specifically the “Hallelujah” chorus — perhaps the most sacrosanct and beloved totem in Western music, rivaled only by the “Ode to Joy” from Beethoven’s Ninth Symphony — conveys malice toward Judaism. A boldly stated article by Mr. Marissen in The New York Times on April 8 drew considerable response from readers, from the saddened to the outraged. But for various reasons the fireworks here were relatively muted.For one thing each of the two prime antagonists hid what appeared to be a steely resolve behind a soft-spoken, mostly polite manner. Mr. Marissen, a scholar at Swarthmore College who has devoted himself largely to examining what might be seen as anti-Judaic tendencies in works by Bach, argued the case against Handel at length. Ruth Smith, a Handel specialist at Cambridge University in England and the author of the landmark book “Handel’s Oratorios and 18th-Century Thought,” responded to the theological aspects of Mr. Marissen’s thesis, disputing many assumptions and interpretations.Wendy Heller, an associate professor of music at Princeton University and one of the organizers of the festival, which was held on campus, livened things up a bit with an animated response to the musical aspects of Mr. Marissen’s argument. And members of the audience, which was laced with prominent Handel scholars, generated heat in the question-and-answer segment that followed.But there were other factors that softened the confrontation, making direct hits difficult. The respondents had not seen Mr. Marissen’s paper in time to tailor their own comments to it. By and large, they were responding to other versions of it, presented at the annual meeting of the American Musicological Society in November; in the article in The Times, “Unsettling History of That Joyous ‘Hallelujah’ ”; and in an extended article for The Journal of Musicology, as yet unpublished but available to the respondents in advance copies.'"

"'07-04-24,'1','At the same time, the two men had more than a little in common, including tumultuous childhoods that left them painfully insecure and a self-serving grandiosity that made them feel they could rationalize dubious means to achieve their ends.Both men saw themselves as foreign policy realists, yet their missteps would be compared by analysts and pundits to the missteps made by neoconservative ideologues in the Bush administration. In both cases, there was a drive to expand executive power. In both cases there was a distrust of the foreign policy elite, which led to policy-making outside the usual channels and a circumvention of experts at the State Department and the C.I.A. In both cases there was a growing isolation at the White House as increasingly unpopular wars ground on. And in both cases there were huge ambitions to recast world affairs.Although Mr. Dallek argues that the Nixon-Kissinger “reach for distinction” had its positive effects, spurring the opening to China and détente with the Soviet Union, he forcefully makes the point that their ambition and arrogance “skewed their judgments and produced terrible decisions in dealings with Vietnam, India-Pakistan, and Chile.” Nixon’s determination to run foreign policy out of the White House meant that Congress and State Department analysts were often cut out of the loop on important decisions. Nixon, for instance, ordered the massive bombing campaign against Hanoi and Haiphong in December 1972, while Congress was in recess for the Christmas break, telling Mr. Kissinger that “one of the beauties of doing it now” is “we don’t have the problem of having to consult with Congress.”Despite growing antiwar sentiment and the president’s own declining poll numbers, despite warnings from commanders on the ground that “the war had become a bottomless pit,” Nixon and Mr. Kissinger, Mr. Dallek says, “clung to the conviction that they could use military pressure to force the North Vietnamese into an agreement that would deliver an autonomous South Vietnam — peace with honor.” They blamed the press for presenting a pessimistic view of the war and insisted that “Vietnamization” was working, while Nixon continued to assert that an American withdrawal from Vietnam would shred the country’s credibility — that it would suffer “a blow from which it will never recover.”Worse, the Nixon administration continued the war — and expanded it into Cambodia, which destabilized that nation, brought the Khmer Rouge to power and led to the annihilation of some two million people under their rule — when it had ample evidence that the war was unwinnable. In fact, as early as 1966, Mr. Dallek writes, two visits to Vietnam left Mr. Kissinger “convinced that a U.S. military victory was out of reach.” Their determination to “stay the course” until Saigon could supposedly stand on its own, Mr. Dallek argues, was in part “the product of political cynicism”:“The domestic political consequences of a collapse were a primary consideration. They hung back from leaving Vietnam until the 1972 elections were behind them. As Kissinger had warned Haldeman when Nixon considered ending U.S. involvement by the close of 1971, turmoil in South Vietnam in 1972 might play havoc with Nixon’s return to the White House.”The ceasefire the United States finally reached with North Vietnam in 1973 was not appreciably different from one that could have been reached four years earlier — and came at a cost of thousands more American lives, countless Vietnamese deaths, the expansion of the war into Cambodia and Laos, and an increasingly divided nation at home.As Mr. Dallek points out, Nixon would try to use his initiatives with China and the Soviet Union to distract attention from the failures in Vietnam — just as, later, he would try to use them to distract attention from his growing problems with Watergate.“Nixon’s use of foreign affairs to overcome impeachment threats in 1973-1974 are a disturbing part of the administration’s history,” Mr. Dallek writes. “Its impact on foreign policy deserves particular consideration, as does the more extensive use of international relations to serve domestic political goals throughout Nixon’s presidency. Nixon’s competence to lead the country during his impeachment crisis also requires the closest possible scrutiny.”Although Mr. Kissinger would later recall that by October 1973, “Nixon no longer had the time or nervous energy to give consistent leadership,” the secretary of state would continue to promote the fiction that the president was in charge during the Yom Kippur War. Mr. Dallek suggests that Mr. Kissinger “would have done well to at least consult with other cabinet members about suspending the president’s authority under the Constitution’s 25th Amendment”; such a move, he writes, would “have signaled Kissinger’s greater concern with the national well-being than with Nixon’s survival.” But “as the inner workings of Nixon’s presidency amply demonstrate, Kissinger was as much the partisan supporter of a highly imperfect administration as he was its foreign policy expert serving the national security.”After leaving office in disgrace in 1974, Nixon would spend the remainder of his life trying to rehabilitate his reputation — and, to a large degree, would succeed. At his funeral in 1994, he was praised for his doggedness and political savvy, and eulogized as a visionary foreign policy maker who helped end the cold war.Mr. Kissinger has continued to write a succession of books, spinning his own reputation and his record in the Nixon administration. Last year Tony Snow, the White House press secretary, said that Mr. Kissinger had been quietly advising President Bush, supporting “the overall thrust and direction of the administration policy” in Iraq.'"
"'07-04-24,'1','“It was not directly from the Japanese government — that is why I did not accept it,” said Ellen van der Ploeg, 84, a Dutch woman who was taken from a prisoner-of-war camp in Indonesia and forced to work in a Japanese military brothel for three months in 1944. “If you have made mistakes in life, you must have the courage to say, ‘I’m sorry, please forgive me.’ But the Japanese government to this day has never taken full responsibility.“If this were a pure government fund, I could have accepted it,” Ms. Van der Ploeg said by telephone from Houten, the Netherlands. “Why should I accept money from private Japanese people? They were also victims during the war.”The Japanese government has held out the fund as one way the country has tried to redress a past wrong, even as the American House of Representatives is considering a resolution that would call on Japan’s government to unequivocally acknowledge its role in the wartime sexual slavery, and to apologize for it.Of the former sex slaves who accepted money from the fund, most did so secretly to avoid criticism. In the four countries where the women, known euphemistically here as comfort women, were compensated individually — South Korea, Taiwan, the Philippines and the Netherlands — the women and their supporters were deeply divided over whether to accept the money.Even those who favored taking the money said the fund reflected an absence of moral clarity in Japan, an opinion that was recently reinforced when Prime Minister Shinzo Abe denied that the Japanese military had played a direct role in coercing women into sexual slavery.“I believed the Japanese government should take direct legal responsibility, but I respected the wishes of the women who wanted to accept the money,” said Marguerite Hamer, the head of a private Dutch organization through which 79 women received compensation. “They are old, and they had such hard lives.”“I was furious and astounded by Abe’s denial,” Ms. Hamer added. “It was really awful for the women. Four of them called me and said, ‘How could this happen again? How could they do this to me again?’ ”About $4.8 million in private contributions were raised for the fund. From that sum, 285 women in South Korea, Taiwan and the Philippines received almost $17,000 each, along with a letter of apology from the Japanese prime minister.The Japanese government stressed that the “atonement money” did not come from the government, in keeping with its position that postwar treaties relieved it of such claims. Experts say it was worried that paying compensation directly would leave it vulnerable to lawsuits from other victims of Japanese militarism.While it did not contribute to the atonement money, though, the Japanese government did provide $6.3 million in “welfare services” to the 79 former sex slaves in the Netherlands and to 285 others.That money was intended for medical and other needs, but in reality the women were free to use this government payment however they wished.There was little practical difference, but a big symbolic one, between “atonement” and “welfare” payments. As a result of the hairsplitting, the governments of Taiwan and South Korea, two former Japanese colonies, rejected the fund and created their own. Both governments pressed former sex slaves to reject the Japanese fund, though supporters acknowledge that some people in each country secretly accepted payments from both the Japanese and the local funds.Haruki Wada, the executive director of the Japanese fund and a historian at the University of Tokyo, defended the program, noting that it was Japan’s first attempt since the end of World War II to compensate its war victims individually.“It doesn’t matter if there’s criticism that the fund was inadequate or that Japan should have done more,” Mr. Wada said. “But to tell the victims that they can’t take this money only made them suffer.”Because of the official opposition in South Korea and Taiwan, officials associated with the Japanese fund often had to contact former sex slaves outside official channels.Wu Huiling, an official at the Taipei Women’s Rescue Foundation, the private organization that has been entrusted by the Taiwanese government to offer services to former sex slaves, said that officials from the Japanese fund sometimes came knocking, unannounced, at the elderly women’s homes.“The grandmas were surprised,” Wu said. “At first, they thought the strangers were con men, but they were only men from the Asian Women’s Fund offering them money.”Because of the sensitivity of the issue, officials at the Japanese fund have refused to offer statistics breaking down the 285 recipients by nationality.“This fund will close without our being able to even announce how many accepted the fund’s payments in South Korea and Taiwan,” Mr. Wada said recently. “Because our work was half-complete, I don’t think the reconciliation between Japan and South Korea was sufficiently carried out.”The opposition was fiercest in South Korea, where a few dozen women are said to have secretly taken the Japanese money.“I resisted for many years,” said Lee Yong Nyeo, 81, one of the few South Koreans who have openly acknowledged receiving money from the Japanese fund. “But I didn’t know whether I would ever get anything, so when the Japanese called a few years ago and said this might be the last chance, I decided to accept it.”Ms. Lee’s family had sent her to work as a maid in private homes at the age of 8. In 1942, when she was 16, Lee was working in a Seoul bar as a maid to older waitresses who served and entertained guests. One day, the Korean bar owner asked whether she was interested in learning to become a nurse and to work in Burma, now known as Myanmar.Feeling she had little choice, she went to Burma aboard a Japanese Navy vessel. Once there, she realized she had been tricked: She was forced to work in a military brothel until the end of the war.“I lived in someone else’s house since I was 8, and I wanted to buy land,” said Ms. Lee in an interview inside her new home outside Seoul, which she bought with money from the fund.In the Philippines, the government offered no domestic assistance to the women who had been sex slaves, and it avoided criticizing the Japanese fund. Analysts said the government feared offending Japan, by far its largest aid donor.“The Filipino government is so dependent on Japanese aid that it cannot rock the boat,” said Ricardo Trota Jose, a historian of Philippine-Japanese relations at the University of the Philippines.Supporters of the former sex slaves in the Philippines did not discourage women from accepting the fund’s payments, but they continued to demand direct reparation from Japan as well.“The Japanese government has presented this fund to deceive our survivors and the international community,” said Nelia Sancho, a women’s rights advocate and a leading supporter of the women in the Philippines.Even in the Netherlands, many of the aging women were confused by the complex nature of the fund, mistakenly believing that it was direct reparation from the Japanese government, Ms. Hamer said.Officially, they received separate payments from the government-financed “welfare services” portion and from the private “atonement” portions of the fund. But as a practical matter, they simply received lumps of money, Ms. Hamer said, and they spent it on anything from new furniture to trips to Indonesia, a Dutch colony before the war, to visit ancestors’ graves.Mr. Wada, the director of the Japanese fund, acknowledged that the nature of the payments to the Dutch was not well understood.“The Dutch took it as compensation, but for the Japanese government, it wasn’t compensation,” he said. “In theory, the payments were for the costs of the welfare services. It was a quintessentially Japanese way of doing things.”'"
"'07-04-24,'1','TOKYO, Tuesday, April 24 (Bloomberg News) — The Nissan Motor Company said Tuesday that it would offer buyouts to workers in Japan for the first time in eight years after slumping domestic sales forced it to cut earnings and sales goals.Nissan, Japan’s third-largest carmaker after Toyota and Honda, expects 1,500 employees to accept the offer, a spokesman, Simon Sproule, said. In the last fiscal year, Nissan missed earnings and sales targets for the first time since Carlos Ghosn became president in 2000. Nissan’s domestic sales, excluding minicars, fell for the 18th consecutive month in March.The program will probably cost Nissan about 20 billion yen, or $169 million, a senior auto analyst at Credit Suisse Group, Koji Endo, said. “We don’t expect much of an impact on earnings,” he said.In February, Nissan cut its profit forecast for the fiscal year that ended March 31 by 12 percent, to 460 billion yen, from 523 billion yen. It lowered its operating profit forecast by 11 percent to 773 billion yen. Nissan is to report earnings on Thursday.The early-retirement program will be offered to 12,000 full-time employees over 45 with more than five years at the company. Manager-level employees are not eligible. The retirement compensation package will be based on years of work, Nissan saidThe application period is from June 1 to the end of March 2008, the company said in a statement.The automaker has offered a similar program in the United States, where more than double the expected number of employees accepted the package. A total of 775 workers agreed to leave the assembly plant in Smyrna, Tenn., and the engine and transmission factory in Decherd, Tenn., the company said last month.'"

"'07-04-24,'1','To make Alpha’s list, a manager needed to earn at least $240 million last year, nearly double the amount in 2005. That is up from a minimum of $30 million in 2001 and 2002. Combined, the top 25 hedge fund managers last year earned $14 billion — enough to pay New York City’s 80,000 public school teachers for nearly three years.With the modern gilded age in full swing, hedge fund managers and their private equity counterparts are comfortably seated atop one of the most astounding piles of wealth in American history.Their ascendancy has been aided by an inflow of money from pension funds and other big investors, robust markets and fee-based compensation that can produce staggering amounts of individual wealth.Naturally, some look upon these masters of the new universe as this generation’s robber barons, using wealth to create wealth, often in secretive ways, and leaving little that is tangible in their wake.Others view them as new-economy financiers, evoking the likes of John D. Rockefeller or John Pierpont Morgan as they provide liquidity to the markets and broadly diversify risks in the banking and financial systems.“You had railroads in the 19th century, which led to the opening up of the steel industry and huge fortunes being made,” said Stephen Brown, a professor at the Stern School of Business of New York University. “Now we’re seeing changes in financial technology leading to new fortunes being made and new dynasties created.”But as hedge funds and their private equity brethren begin to emerge more onto the public stage — playing increasingly bigger roles in art and cultural circles, tiptoeing into the Washington lobbying game, and even selling shares of their own firms to the public — all aspects of their activities, their own compensation in particular, are raising eyebrows.“There is some question as to what the hell they are doing that is worth” that kind of money, said J. Bradford DeLong, an economist at the University of California, Berkeley. “The answer is damned mysterious.”Indeed, to some, it is difficult to see the value and the risks created by a hedge fund that bets billions of dollars on movements in everything from global currencies, stocks and bonds to real estate, reinsurance and complex credit derivatives. Recently, for instance, the House Financial Services Committee held hearings focusing on the potential risks to pensioners and the financial system caused by hedge funds.Yet many, including past and current Federal Reserve chieftains, argue that they are greasing the wheels of capitalism.While the debate rages, the new financiers are building up piles of money not seen since the heady days of the Internet boom. But unlike the wealth of many dot-com billionaires, who saw their fortunes collapse with the technology bubble, the gains of hedge funds are not simply returns on paper that fluctuate with the direction of the stock market. Instead the gains are huge cash payouts that most managers then reinvest in their funds, betting that they will continue to beat the markets.Still, the performance of these managers is as varied as their strategies, ranging from complex computer models to the more old-fashioned version of betting the farm on a few stocks. None of the managers contacted for this article returned calls or would comment.For its rankings on compensation, Alpha magazine includes the managers’ share of the firm’s management fees, usually 2 percent, and performance fees, or a share of the profits, which typically start at 20 percent.That structure means that some hedge fund managers can still earn a huge income even with mediocre returns because of the huge size of the assets under management. Raymond T. Dalio, head of Bridgewater Associates, which has more than $30 billion in hedge fund assets, for example, took home $350 million last year even though his flagship Pure Alpha Strategy fund posted a net return of just 3.4 percent for the second consecutive year.The magazine also includes gains made on hedge fund managers’ own capital in their funds. Mr. Simons, for instance, has more than $1 billion of his own money invested in his funds.Topping Alpha’s list for the second consecutive year, Mr. Simons, a former code breaker for the Defense Department, uses computer-driven models to detect pricing anomalies in stocks, commodities, futures and options.Even though he has some of the highest fees in the business — 5 percent of assets under management and 44 percent of profits — he trounces most of his competitors year after year. In 2006, the $6 billion Medallion fund posted gross returns of 84 percent; 44 percent after fees, explaining his $1.7 billion take.Some investors do not blink at paying those startling fees. “If you pay peanuts, you get monkeys,” said Jim Dunn, a managing director with Wilshire Associates, an investment advisory firm. “We don’t concern ourselves with fees. If you can provide Alpha, I’m less concerned about what you bring home.” (Alpha is producing returns that are not tied to a market benchmark like the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index.)While Mr. Simons makes his mark using algorithms, the two other billionaires on this year’s list are building distinctive institutions.Mr. Griffin’s Citadel Investment Group of Chicago is often cited as a budding Goldman Sachs, and Mr. Griffin himself is playing an increasingly public role in Chicago, with causes ranging from art to education.Citadel employs 1,000 people, more than half of them in technology, and runs businesses serving hedge funds and another making markets. Mr. Griffin’s funds, with returns of more than 30 percent, helped net him a nifty $1.4 billion.Compare that with the elusive Mr. Lampert, who has $11 billion of his $14.6 billion ESL fund in the retailer Sears Holdings. Last year, Sears stock rose and with it, Mr. Lampert’s fortune by about $1.3 billion.And if the Internet age was defined by youth, the hedge fund age illustrates that experience indeed pays.The average age of Alpha’s top 25 was 51, with only four thirty-somethings on the list. Among them is John Arnold, the 32-year-old from Centaurus Advisors who amassed net gains of 200 percent last year.Mr. Arnold hails from Enron’s energy desk, where he received a lifetime of trading and other experiences. His $3 billion fund, among the largest energy funds in the world, racked up huge gains by taking the other side of a natural gas bet that caused Amaranth to lose more than $6 billion in a week.But older, more familiar names dominate Alpha’s list. Boone Pickens, the 78-year-old oil tycoon, made $340 million on the back of strong returns at his energy funds and Carl C. Icahn, 71, the reborn activist investor, made $600 million.With a greater proportion of the assets in the hedge fund industry controlled by fewer managers, some investors worry that managers are at a turning point. The same young and brash managers who achieved huge successes are now controlling vast sums of assets, and the incentive may be to protect their wealth rather than take risks to increase it.“I think one of the significant issues of this business that we are all struggling with is that there is an inverse correlation between compensation and drive,” said Mark W.

"'07-04-24,'1','Jorge Luis García Pérez, a dissident leader widely known by the nickname Antúnez, was freed from prison on Sunday after serving his entire 17-year sentence on charges of engaging in enemy propaganda, rights groups reported. At the same time, they reported the case of a dissident lawyer, Rolando Jiménez Posada, sentenced after a secret trial over the weekend to 12 years in prison for painting graffiti and distributing pamphlets with an anti-government message. He has been jailed since his arrest in early 2003. According to Elizardo Sánchez, a leading dissident and a spokesman for the independent Cuban Commission for Human Rights and Reconciliation, relatives of Mr. Jiménez Posada say that the authorities denied his request to represent himself in court and that when he protested, he was not allowed to attend his own trial. “The biggest worry for the commission is that in two weeks, we have seen two similar secret trials behind closed doors, without relatives or defense attorneys present,” Mr. Sánchez said.'"
"'07-04-24,'1','The other executive, Fred D. Anderson, the company’s former chief financial officer, is preparing to enter into a settlement with the S.E.C. over the dating of an option grant to senior officials in January 2001, according to a person close to the settlement negotiations.The settlement terms are said to include a payment of about $3.5 million, an amount representing his personal gains from the options and a small civil penalty.Significantly, as part of the agreement, Mr. Anderson will not be required to give up his role as a director of several public companies, the person close to the negotiations said. He is currently chairman of the audit committee of eBay and a managing director at Elevation Partners, a venture capital firm.A spokesman for Mr. Anderson said he would not comment, pending a decision by the S.E.C. to file a lawsuit. A commission spokesman also declined to comment.Mr. Anderson joined Apple in 1996 and left as chief financial officer in 2004 to join Elevation Partners. He stepped down from the Apple board last October in the course of the internal investigation of options practices. Ms. Heinen, who followed Mr. Jobs to Apple from Next Software in 1997, left the company last spring.It is not clear whether the two prospective S.E.C. civil lawsuits will be the extent of the commission’s action against Apple or its executives over the backdating activities. Nor is it clear when an investigation by the United States attorney’s office in San Francisco will come to a conclusion. A spokesman for the office had no comment yesterday.But Apple’s stock rose $2.54, to $93.51, yesterday after an article in The Mercury News on Sunday, citing unidentified sources, said evidence suggested that Mr. Jobs was unlikely to face civil or criminal charges.Apple said it was continuing to cooperate with the investigations.Of the two executives facing imminent S.E.C. action, Ms. Heinen is confronting the more serious charges. The S.E.C. lawsuit is expected to accuse her of having played in role in picking false dates for two options grants — an October 2001 date for a grant to Mr. Jobs, and the January 2001 date for the grant to the company’s top executives, which included both Mr. Anderson and Ms. Heinen.The case against Mr. Anderson involves only the January 2001 grant, and does not assert that he picked the falsely recorded date, but notes that as chief financial officer he was copied on e-mail messages that discussed the dating, according to a person close to the negotiations.Apple is the most prominent of a number of technology companies that have been caught up in both civil and criminal investigations over the recording of inaccurate stock option grant dates.During the dot-com era, the practice of backdating stock grants to a lower stock price, increasing their value when exercised, was common in Silicon Valley. When he returned to Apple in 1997, Mr. Jobs issued a significant number of options grants to employees in an effort to hold on to scarce talent during the boom times.In December, after a six-month investigation of “irregularities” in its options practices, Apple said 6,427 grants from 1997 to 2002 had been backdated, including a large grant to Mr. Jobs. That grant, approved in December 2001, was ultimately reported to have been made at an Apple board meeting that October — a session that never took place. The stock price rose in the interim.The minutes of the supposed meeting have been attributed to Wendy Howell, who worked in Apple’s legal department and has since left the company. But who might have authorized or known of the fabrication is in dispute.Ms. Howell’s lawyer, Thomas F. Carlucci, said yesterday that his client “had no personal reason whatsoever, financial or otherwise, to prepare the subject documents.” He emphasized that “Ms. Howell was a line attorney at Apple who prepared documents at the request of her superiors” and that “at no time did she act alone, or without direction from Apple management.”Ms. Heinen’s lawyer, Ms. Arguedas, said yesterday that her client had not given Ms. Howell any instructions in connection with the falsified minutes.The other grant that figures in the S.E.C. lawsuits, made to senior executives, was dated Jan. 17, 2001, but is said to have received final approval some weeks later. That grant was made by Mr. Jobs as chief executive and chairman.Ms. Arguedas said Ms. Heinen had no incriminating information about Mr. Jobs. “He knew about this in the sense that the board knew everything about this,” she said. “We don’t think it’s incriminating because we don’t think anything wrong happened here.”'"
"'07-04-24,'1','“People are pretty passionate when you simplify things for them, and that’s rich territory for getting people to spend more time with the brand,” said Martha Cleary, vice president and group account director for Philips’s media agency, Carat USA, part of the Aegis Group.The most unusual element of this stage of the campaign is its heavy reliance on cellphones, which are just starting to emerge as a tool for marketers and for e-commerce.Indeed, Philips is using the concierge service to experiment with wireless e-commerce. In addition to text recommendations, users with Web-enabled phones get a screen message with a link to a Philips area of Amazon.com, where they are encouraged to buy products.“Our intent is to show people that this technology can work for you and help you,” Mr. Plaskonos said. “Eventually, our hope is that this will transfer to mobile purchasing, through sites like Amazon, of products that they need for gifting purposes.”Mr. Plaskonos said that the e-commerce feature was still “a little bit out there in terms of consumer behavior” and that Amazon has not seen a lot of sales from it yet. “But we’re interested in seeing if this is something that people will begin to pick up on,” he added.For Condé Nast, which has its own branded mobile sites and cellphone shopping services, the Philips program is expected to yield further insights into how its content translates to the mobile arena.Richard Beckman, president of the Condé Nast Media Group, said he was eager to see how many consumers would use the concierge service. The companies will keep track of which information categories prove the most popular and will fine-tune the service accordingly.To get travel tips by cellphone, users must send a text message to 82222 and enter an information category and city abbreviation. The Philips concierge then sends them back a list of five recommended establishments. A request for New York City restaurants, for example, steers people to August, Babbo, Balthazar, Barney Greengrass and BLT Steak.The concierge service is being introduced through advertising supplements running in the May and June issues of Condé Nast Traveler, Golf, Gourmet, House & Garden, Self, Vanity Fair and Wired, plus one May and one June issue of the weekly New Yorker. Depending on which magazines generate the most traffic, Philips will also run ads in some later issues.Ads for the service will also run through June 30 on the eight publications’ Web sites, including Concierge.com (Condé Nast Traveler’s site) and Epicurious.com, which features recipes and other content from Gourmet and Bon Appétit.Mr. Plaskonos of Philips said that the “sense and simplicity” campaign has already helped link the Philips brand to the concept of simplicity in the minds of many consumers. First came a 2005 sponsorship of a “60 Minutes” episode in which Philips gave back all the national commercial time so that the show could broadcast longer news segments.Last year there were other examples, like a 98-page supplement to Gourmet magazine that showcased literary writing about food, issues of Business 2.0, Fortune, People and Time that let readers flip straight from the cover to the table of contents, and periods of free access to paid areas of the Web sites NYTimes.com, ESPN.com and WSJ.com.Perhaps the best-known example was the Philips sole sponsorship that reduced commercials on NBC’s Dec. 4, 2006 “Nightly News With Brian Williams” broadcast from seven minutes to just over one minute. That newscast saw an 8 percent ratings lift and generated 9,400 grateful e-mail messages over three days.Other marketers have taken note. Pfizer was the sole sponsor of the first three Monday evening editions of “ABC World News With Charles Gibson” this month, and CVS made a similar arrangement with ABC for the broadcast of the show last night.The North American division of Philips has committed about 25 percent of its 2007 advertising budget to the “sense and simplicity” campaign, about the same percentage as in 2006, Mr. Plaskonos said. According to TNS Media Intelligence, Philips’s ad spending in the United States was $105.3 million last year.The campaign for the concierge service reflects some lessons learned from the sponsorships. “One of our takeaways was that people are interested in turning other people on to shortcuts or solutions for simplifying problems in their lives,” said Mr. Plaskonos.'"
"'07-04-24,'1','Congressional negotiators have finally reached an agreement on a bill to raise the federal minimum wage. But in getting to that important point, some Democratic lawmakers have shown the same disturbing tendency as their Republican kin to turn pressing issues into pretexts for more tax cuts.The bill would raise the minimum wage to $7.25 an hour by 2009 from $5.15 — the level it has been stalled at for a decade. It also contains tax cuts that would be worth $8 billion over the next five years. About a third of those cuts are aimed at businesses that are apt to employ minimum wage workers. They include a nearly four-year extension of a tax credit for hiring people from such underemployed groups as high-risk youth. Another big chunk would allow small businesses to take bigger write-offs when they bought new equipment. That’s not specifically intended to help low-wage employers, but would probably help some.But about $600 million of the bill’s tax breaks have no reasonable connection to the minimum wage. Senate Democrats were among the main drivers behind $366 million in tax cuts on behalf of a narrowly targeted group of corporate constituents, including more generous tax treatment of some companies’ investment income. House lawmakers — more attuned to urgent needs — added an additional $246 million in tax breaks for hurricane-ravaged areas on the Gulf Coast. The corporate tax breaks, however, would be permanent, and would balloon to a cost of nearly $900 million over 10 years while the Gulf Coast tax breaks would be temporary.Tax cuts that measure in the hundreds of millions of dollars are chicken feed compared with the hundreds of billions in tax cuts championed by the Bush administration and pushed through Congress in the last six years. And to the Democrats’ credit, all of the tax cuts in the minimum wage bill are paid for in the long run, generally by closing overly generous tax breaks elsewhere in the code. But closing loopholes to pay for tax cuts for corporate constituents means that money is not available to pay for programs for needier Americans.Congress is to be commended for making the minimum wage bill a priority and should look for every opportunity to send it to Mr. Bush. But to really move the nation in a new direction, lawmakers will have to temper their enthusiasm for never-ending tax cuts.'"
"'07-04-24,'1','So it is tourists who will make the museum’s new location viable. Even if Little Italy is a shrinking version of the teeming neighborhood the museum memorializes, it draws visitors, he said.“The tour bus stops right here,” said Dr. Jerome Stabile III, whose family has owned the three buildings that will house the museum since the 1880s. “More than once, someone has come up to me and said, ‘Can you tell me where Little Italy is?’ ”But the museum is looking for more than exhibition space. Its long-term plan calls for a two-story addition above the three-story buildings it is buying.“We wanted to demonstrate the continuance, the old and the new,” Dr. Scelsa said. “So we want something modern on top.”The three buildings date to the first half of the 19th century, Dr. Scelsa said, and in their early years were home to a bank.“It’s the way it looked when I was a kid,” said Dr. Stabile, 76, a retired surgeon, and great-grandson of the bank’s founder, Francesco Rosario Stabile. “We’re happy Joe is taking over so this does not become another restaurant.”Dr. Stabile’s father and uncles were born in the apartment above the bank, Banca Stabile. The bank remained independent until the Depression, when it merged with Banca Commerciale Italiana Trust Company and his grandfather added an insurance and travel agency.One of the bank’s safes remains in the building, a double-door unit that takes up about half the space behind two tellers’ windows. “This was challenging to me as a kid,” Dr. Stabile said, pulling open one of the safe’s heavy doors. “Even though I had the combination, I couldn’t open it.”The museum began after a 1999 exhibition at the New-York Historical Society on Italian-Americans in New York that drew 50,000 visitors, five times the number that had been expected. “I said, if we’re ever going to be established, we need our own institution,” Dr. Scelsa said.The museum received its charter in 2001 and became an affiliate of the City University of New York in 2003. Since then, while searching for a new home for the museum, its leaders decided that it needed to be in Little Italy, even as the neighborhood has become home to fewer and fewer Italian-Americans. Figures from the 2000 census put the Asian population in Little Italy at more than 8,200, which was about eight times the number of residents of Italian descent.“It has not been gentrifying the way the Police Building got gentrified, the way NoLIta got gentrified,” said Sean Sweeney, a member of Community Board 2, referring to 240 Centre Street, which was the Police Department’s headquarters until the 1970s and is now an apartment building. “Some would argue there’s ‘squalification,’ to make up a word. Some of the storefronts that sell dried clams and sea urchins and putrescible vegetables give it a kind of squalid character.”'"
"'07-04-24,'1','Microsoft, seeking to avoid another multimillion-dollar fine in its antitrust battle with the European Commission, filed documents with competition officials yesterday defending its demand to be paid royalties for releasing some software code to competitors.Without disclosing what is in the documents, Tom Brookes, a Microsoft spokesman in Brussels, said the company filed its response to the commission’s charge on March 1 that it was violating a 2004 order to share the code at “reasonable terms” so competitors could design software that worked seamlessly with Microsoft computer servers.The legal skirmishes over the European Commission’s antitrust ruling against Microsoft are moving into a fourth year. In its original ruling, the commission ordered Microsoft to sell a version of its Windows operating system without its Windows Media Player. Microsoft did so, but the so-called N version, which sold for the same price as Windows with the Media Player included, was a commercial flop.Microsoft maintains that the other remedy imposed in the 2004 ruling — that it share its confidential server software code — implied that it could charge royalties.But competitors say that Microsoft is asking exorbitant fees, discouraging many from designing software to work with Microsoft products. According to its Web site, Microsoft is proposing royalty fees that range from $5.60 to $666.75 a server under a formula that ties the fee level to the revenue generated by any software designed using Microsoft’s information.'"
"'07-04-24,'1','“The Wiccan families we represented were in no way asking for special treatment,” the Rev. Barry W. Lynn, executive director of Americans United, said at a news conference Monday. “They wanted precisely the same treatment that dozens of other religions already had received from the department, an acknowledgment that their spiritual beliefs were on par with those of everyone else.”A Veterans Affairs spokesman, Matt Burns, confirmed that the “V.A. will be adding the pentacle to its list of approved emblems of belief that will be engraved on government-provided markers.”“The government acted to settle in the interest of the families concerned,” Mr. Burns added, “and to spare taxpayers the expense of further litigation.”There are 1,800 Wiccans in the Air Force, according to a Pentagon survey cited in the suit, and Wiccans have their faith mentioned in official handbooks for military chaplains and noted on their dog tags.At least 11 families will be immediately affected by the V.A.’s decision, said the Rev. Selena Fox, senior minister of Circle Sanctuary, a Wiccan church in Wisconsin.In reviewing 30,000 pages of documents from Veterans Affairs, Americans United said, it found e-mail and memorandums referring to negative comments President Bush made about Wicca in an interview with “Good Morning America” in 1999, when he was governor of Texas. The interview had to do with a controversy at the time about Wiccan soldiers’ being allowed to worship at Fort Hood, Tex.“I don’t think witchcraft is a religion,” Mr. Bush said at the time, according to a transcript. “I would hope the military officials would take a second look at the decision they made.”Americans United did not assert that the White House influenced the Veterans Affairs Department. Under the settlement, Americans United had to return the documents and could not copy them, though it could make limited comments about their contents, Mr. Katskee said.Americans United filed the lawsuit last November on behalf of several Wiccan military families. Among the plaintiffs was Roberta Stewart, whose husband, Sgt. Patrick Stewart, was killed in September 2005 in Afghanistan.Ms. Stewart said she had tried various avenues to get the pentacle approved. Late last year, Gov. Kenny Guinn of Nevada, her home state, approved the placing of a marker with a pentacle in a Veterans Affairs cemetery in Fernley, east of Reno. But Ms. Stewart said she had continued to pursue the lawsuit because she wanted the federal government to approve the markers.Other religious groups that have often opposed Americans United supported the effort to have the government approve the pentacle.“I was just aghast that someone who would fight for their country and die for their country would not get the symbol he wanted on his gravestone,” said John W. Whitehead, president of the Rutherford Institute, which litigates many First Amendment cases. “It’s just overt religious discrimination.”'"
"'07-04-24,'1','BISBEE, Ariz., April 23 — A Border Patrol agent who shot and killed a Mexican immigrant along the Arizona-Mexico border in January was charged Monday with first-degree murder and three related offenses.The agent, 39-year-old Nicholas Corbett of Sierra Vista, Ariz., shot Francisco Javier Dominguez Rivera, 22, while taking him into custody on Jan. 12, shortly after Mr. Dominguez Rivera and three family members crossed illegally into Cochise County in southeastern Arizona.Mr. Corbett declined to be interviewed by investigators from the Cochise County Sheriff’s Department but told supervisors at the Naco Border Patrol station that Mr. Dominguez Rivera had threatened him from across his truck with a rock, according to evidence released by the Cochise County attorney, Ed Rheinheimer, on March 26 after a public records request by local news organizations.Mr. Rheinheimer said Monday that physical evidence and statements from other witnesses failed to support Mr. Corbett’s account.Mr. Rheinheimer also charged Mr. Corbett with the lesser offenses of second-degree murder, manslaughter and negligent homicide. Whether probable cause exists for the charges will be determined by a justice of the peace at a preliminary hearing that has not yet been set.'"

"'07-04-24,'1','During an evening news conference, Mr. Gates said he believed that Mr. Serdyukov’s statement had been written before the meetings on Monday. After a full day of talks with a range of senior Kremlin leaders, Mr. Gates said he was ending his visit “on a very positive tone.”“We made some real headway in clearing up some misunderstanding about the technical characteristics of the system that are of concern to the Russians,” Mr. Gates said.“The key to this is cooperation,” he added. “We would like to have the Russians as partners in this process. We would like to share information with them. We are prepared to co-locate radars with them.”A joint missile defense effort offers “some real opportunity here for both sides,” Mr. Gates said. “And that involves a great deal of transparency on our part — and we are prepared to do that.”In one action growing out of the talks on Monday, the two sides agreed to order a group of Russian and American government and military experts to formally address the Kremlin’s questions and concerns, Mr. Gates said.Mr. Gates said he invited Russian officials to visit the American missile defense site in Alaska and see the nonexplosive interceptors, similar to the 10 proposed for locations in Poland. He also invited the Russians to inspect the American missile tracking radar in California, which is similar to one proposed for the Czech Republic.Separately, senior administration officials have said that, with the permission of Poland and the Czech Republic, the Russians would also be allowed routine inspection of any eventual American missile defense bases in those countries, to help quiet Moscow’s concerns that the sites could be used for offensive weapons.The invitations for cooperation laid out for the Russians, Mr. Gates said, “went well beyond anything anybody had seen before in terms of details and scope of what we are talking about.”In addition to meeting with the defense minister, Mr. Gates also had talks with President Vladimir V. Putin and with Sergei B. Ivanov, the first deputy prime minister, who previously served as minister of defense.Although he expressed the expected cautious optimism about the way ahead, Mr. Gates did not deny that significant gaps existed in American and Russian perceptions of the Iranian threat and, therefore, over the real purpose of the proposed missile defense sites. The Russians, Mr. Gates said, remained skeptical that Iran would have an intercontinental ballistic missile capable of reaching all of Europe in the foreseeable future.The arrival of Mr. Gates in Moscow early Monday illustrated the importance that the Bush administration places on calming Kremlin fears about missile defense, fears that have threatened to rupture relations between the United States and Russia and have greatly worried NATO allies.In February, Mr. Gates received a dramatic invitation for a visit, delivered by Mr. Putin at an international security conference in Munich. The Russian president gave an unexpectedly caustic analysis of American foreign policy, including a harsh critique of American missile defenses, but he concluded the address by walking across the conference hall to Mr. Gates’s table and inviting the American defense secretary to come see him in Russia.In the weeks since then, rising tensions with Moscow over missile defense had reached such levels of concern among top Bush administration officials that Mr. Gates moved his tentative visit up from the fall and, less than 48 hours after a grueling trip to Iraq, the defense secretary was back aboard his government plane for the flight to Moscow on Sunday.Gordon D. Johndroe, the spokesman for the National Security Council, said missile defense was also discussed Monday morning in a phone call between Mr. Bush and Mr. Putin. Mr. Johndroe did not provide details, except to say the two men talked briefly about Mr. Gates’s visit.'"
"'07-04-24,'1','Mr. Brendlin eventually pleaded guilty to a narcotics charge but appealed on the ground that the evidence should be suppressed. The California Supreme Court ruled that because only the driver, and not Mr. Brendlin, had been seized by the stop, Mr. Brendlin had no basis for challenging anything that flowed from it.Elizabeth M. Campbell, Mr. Brendlin’s lawyer, told the justices that when a police officer makes a traffic stop, “he seizes not only the driver of the car but also the car and every person and everything in that car.”There might be an exception, she acknowledged in answer to a question from Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr., who asked whether a passenger would be seized if the officer, “before even approaching the car, got on the loudspeaker and said: ‘Driver remain in the car. Passenger, you’re free to go.’ ”That hypothetical passenger would not be seized, Ms. Campbell said. But typically, she said, “a forward motion stopped by government means, intentionally applied, is a seizure.” Mr. Brendlin was entitled to challenge the search and to have the incriminating evidence excluded, she said.The court was looking for a general rule to govern the typical passenger case; future cases will turn not on the facts of a particular case but whether there was a seizure as a matter of Fourth Amendment law. Most state courts have ruled that passengers in a typical traffic stop are seized.Deputy Attorney General Clifford E. Zall of California argued that the driver, but not the passenger, is seized because it is the driver who submits to the officer’s authority by stopping the car. When Mr. Zall referred to “the pervasiveness and commonplace nature of a routine traffic stop,” Justice David H. Souter interrupted him in an incredulous tone. “Have you ever been subject to a traffic stop?” Justice Souter asked.“O.K.,” Justice Souter said. “The heart rate went up. The blood pressure went up.”A majority of the justices indicated their belief that the passenger as well as the driver was seized.Such a conclusion may not be of much help, however, to Mr. Brendlin in his appeal, Brendlin v. California. No. 06-8120, because of an atypical aspect of his case. Many of the justices appeared to think that his arrest as a parole violator, on an existing warrant, was valid, and provided independent justification for the search. Mr. Brendlin could therefore lose his battle while winning the war for others.WASHINGTON, April 23 (AP) — The University of Phoenix failed on Monday to win Supreme Court review of a lawsuit against the institution over student recruitment.The university wanted to reverse a decision by the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in favor of two former counselors who say their pay was based on the number of students they enrolled. The appeals court had refused the university’s request to dismiss the case.Because of abuses brought to light in the 1990s, the Higher Education Act requires that schools promise not to base pay on securing enrollment or financial aid.'"
"'07-04-24,'1','Ms. Smith’s friendship with Mr. Mapplethorpe began in 1967 when they were both art students at Pratt Institute in Brooklyn. They were living together near the Chelsea Hotel in the early 1970s when Mr. Mapplethorpe first brought Mr. Wagstaff to meet her. “Sam came in and seemed totally at home in my mess,” she recalls. “We liked each other immediately. He had such a great sense of humor and had such a nonpretentious and nonsanctimonious spiritual air.”Dominick Dunne met Mr. Wagstaff when they were both young men in New York, and he talks about the dichotomy between Mr. Wagstaff’s life in the closet in the 1950s and his more public profile later with Mr. Mapplethorpe. “Sam Wagstaff was the New York deb’s delight,” he says in the film. “He was probably one of the handsomest men I ever saw. Tall and slender and aristocratic-looking. And he was funny. And he was nice. And the girls went absolutely nuts over him.”Gordon Baldwin, a curator at the Getty Museum, recalls in the film that Mr. Wagstaff was proud of his aristocratic background and says Mr. Wagstaff told him more than once that his family had owned the farms where the Metropolitan Museum is now, at the time of the Revolution. “It was pretty clear that he came from a starchy background,” he said.Still, Mr. Dunne notes how oppressive the taboos about homosexuality were for Mr. Wagstaff in the 1950s. Having had a privileged childhood on Central Park South and attended Hotchkiss with classmates like Dean Witter, of the brokerage firm, and Malcolm Baldrige, future secretary of commerce under President Reagan, Mr. Wagstaff seemed destined to become part of New York society.He didn’t like talking about that period in his life, Ms. Smith remembers. “He would say things with a painful tone in his voice about the suppression and oppression of a homosexual man in the 1950s,” she said. “I never asked him about it because it was the one area I could really sense pain in him.”Mr. Wagstaff certainly made up for lost time. In the early 1970s, he “became an eager participant in the excesses of the age,” says Joan Juliet Buck, the writer who narrates the film with a lofty voice, reading adulatory, if not lapidary, biographical prose that delivers the facts about Mr. Wagstaff’s life in a tone aimed at, well, posterity. He was “always in rebellion against his conservative and upper class background,” she notes.“He often held drug parties in his Bowery apartment,” Ms. Buck says at one point, as if holding her nose at the very idea. “He used drugs for sex and he liked the alternative perspectives they offered.”Philippe Garner, a director of Christie’s in London and a friend of both men, says in the film: “My guess is that Robert gave Sam the courage to explore areas of his personality, to savor a darker kind of lifestyle than he would have done on his own. He unlocked a dark genie within him.”Despite Mr. Wagstaff’s sybaritic activities and his relationship with Mr. Mapplethorpe, unconventional at the time, he managed to amass a world-class photography collection and also to shape the other man’s career. From the humble Polaroids Mr. Mapplethorpe was making when they first met to his more provocative and refined photographs, which now command $300,000 a print at auction, the influence of Mr. Wagstaff’s taste and aesthetic sensibility on his work is undeniable.The film’s title, “Black White + Gray,” has several meanings. Most, if not all, of the photographs in the Wagstaff collection were black and white. Most of Mr. Mapplethorpe’s best-known work is black and white too, and many of his nude subjects were African-American.But more specifically, the title refers to an exhibition called “Black, White and Gray” organized by Mr. Wagstaff as a curator at the Wadsworth Atheneum in the early 1960s. The show included works by Barnett Newman, Ellsworth Kelly, Ad Reinhardt and Jasper Johns, among others.The show “sent shock waves through popular culture and heralded fashion’s embrace of Minimalist aesthetics,” Ms. Buck says in her narration. At the time Vogue magazine published an eight-page feature on James Galanos’s couture, with Mr. Wagstaff’s exhibition as the backdrop.“Back in the 1960s, curators like Sam, Frank O’Hara and Henry Geldzahler were much more like artists than a lot of curators on the scene are today,” Raymond Foye, the publisher of Hanuman Books, an independent press, says in the film.“He had a very special antenna to find what was new, what was good, what resonated with him,” says Clark Worswick, a curator and photography scholar.The film’s narration tends to cast Mr. Wagstaff in nothing less than Olympian terms: “His aesthetic underscores an unequal vision grounded in passion, intelligence, sexuality and clever financial speculation,” Ms. Buck recites as rare self-portraits by Mr. Wagstaff are shown. “He had few rivals in his time. And none at all today.”The intimate, never-before-shown photographs of Mr. Wagstaff and Mr. Mapplethorpe throughout “Black White + Gray” make great social anthropology, and the interviews with Ms. Smith, Mr. Dunne and others give depth and warmth to an otherwise stiff, if earnest, portrait.Both Mr. Wagstaff and Mr. Mapplethorpe died of AIDS, Mr. Wagstaff in 1987 and Mr. Mapplethorpe in 1989.One snippet of footage shows a shy and endearing Ms. Smith reciting a short poem of hers in an interview on the BBC in 1971: “New York is the thing that seduced me. New York is the thing that formed me. New York is the thing that deformed me. New York is the thing that perverted me. New York is the thing that converted me. And New York is the thing that I love too.”Written before she met Mr. Wagstaff, this little gem nevertheless proves to be a fitting coda to the film — and to the man.'"
"'07-04-24,'1','I disagree with Kirk W. Johnson’s characterization, in “Hounded by Insurgents, Abandoned by Us” (Op-Ed, April 18), of my objection to a recent legislative proposal that would revise the immigration code’s prohibition on allowing individuals tied to terrorist activity or groups to enter the United States.I support the original purpose of the legislation, which is to permit groups like the Hmong in Southeast Asia and Iraqis who have helped the United States in their country and do not pose a threat to our security to enter the United States.I oppose the way the legislation was eventually written because it would make it very difficult to bar people from entering the United States who have given material support to even the worst terrorist groups, such as Hamas and Al Qaeda. That is simply unacceptable.We all agree that we should help the Hmong and other groups that have taken personal risks to assist the United States. That’s why I introduced amendments to the 9/11 commission bill that would allow entry to groups like the Hmong, but would bar people tied to groups that indisputably are terrorist organizations.'"
"'07-04-24,'1','Helicobacter pylori, the main cause of peptic ulcer disease, might have a beneficial effect in reducing the risk of asthma and allergies, a study published yesterday suggests.Researchers questioned 7,663 men and women about their history of asthma, allergic rhinitis and allergy symptoms, and tested them for antibodies to H. pylori. They also administered skin tests using 10 standardized allergens.Over all, there was no association between the presence of H. pylori and current asthma status. But subjects under 43 who were colonized with the most virulent strain of H. pylori, called cagA, were 32 percent less likely to have asthma, 35 percent less likely to have allergic rhinitis and 20 percent less likely to report allergy symptoms than those who did not carry the bacterium. These subjects were roughly one-third less likely to have skin sensitivity to five common pollen plants and to Alternaria alternata, a mold.According to the article, which appears in the journal Archives of Internal Medicine, H. pylori acquisition in industrialized countries has been diminishing with each succeeding generation for at least the past 60 years.“Helicobacter was once ubiquitous,” said Dr. Martin J. Blaser, a co-author of the article and the chairman of the department of medicine at New York University. “We provide evidence that there is a relationship between the decrease in helicobacter prevalence and the increase in childhood asthma.”The researchers noted that their observations were consistent with the “hygiene hypothesis,” which suggests that childhood infections, particularly infections of the gut, help diminish or prevent allergies and asthma.'"
"'07-04-24,'1','A British sky watcher named Thomas William Backhouse was perhaps the first to notice the odd blue wisps in 1885, and many scientists thought that the phenomenon was an atmospheric effect caused by ash thrown up by the gigantic volcanic eruption of Krakatoa in Indonesia two years earlier.Although the ash settled out of the air, the noctilucent clouds persisted and spread.At first they were seen only at higher latitudes in places like Norway, Russia and England. Now they can be seen as far south as Colorado, at about 40 degrees latitude.The essential ingredients are temperatures from minus 225 to minus 190 degrees Fahrenheit, water vapor and particles of dust that serve as seeds for the ice crystals that form the clouds.Since 1980, when regular space-based observations of noctilucent clouds began, their number has increased about 28 percent per decade, and they are reflecting more light, because the ice crystals are bigger.“The most plausible and leading theory is CO2 buildup, which causes global warming,” Dr. Russell said. Increasing temperatures near the surface actually cause the upper part of the atmosphere to cool, and cooler temperatures could spur the formation of more clouds. “If that’s true and we are changing the atmosphere in a remote location like this, that means we’re changing the entire atmosphere,” he said.The satellite, called Aeronomy of Ice in the Mesosphere, or AIM, is 55 inches high by 43 inches wide and weighs 430 pounds. As early as tomorrow, a modified jetliner will take off from Vandenberg Air Force Base, Calif., with a rocket plane holding the satellite attached on its underside. At 40,000 feet, the rocket plane will drop away and, after igniting its engine, shoot upward.When the AIM reaches its orbit 370 miles above the Earth, its three instruments will photograph noctilucent clouds, measure the size of the ice crystals and note conditions like temperature, air pressure and moisture levels. The $140 million mission is the first dedicated to studying noctilucent clouds.Among the questions scientists hope to answer are these: Where is the dust seeding the clouds coming from? Is it composed of tiny meteors from outer space, particles wafting up from the lower atmosphere, or possibly charged atoms created in that part in the atmosphere?Another mystery: noctilucent clouds in the Southern Hemisphere are about half a mile higher than in the north.'"
"'07-04-24,'1','Called “First Look,” it is an introduction to the plane, and features Boeing employees involved with its research, design and marketing. The second video, called “Welcome Aboard,” lets viewers walk through the plane, and discusses its special lighting systems and windows. Elbert Lin, manager of Web strategy and implementation for Boeing Commercial Airplanes, compared viewing this to checking out the interior of a car. The third one, which will be posted in May, is expected to discuss other technological innovations.The videos offer “a more relaxed, casual way to interact with our customers,” said Rob Pollack, vice president, brand and market positioning for Boeing Commercial Airplanes. “We can show more in-depth what makes the plane special and unique. And, on average, visitors to the Web site spend more than six minutes on it and interact with it.”Patrick Sarkissian, president of Sarkissian Mason, which previously has used the technology employed in the videos to create short films for automotive clients like Ford, Mazda and Chrysler Financial, said visitors to Boeing’s site are spending “double to triple the amount of time that we see in the automotive world.”According to Mr. Pollack, the target audience for Boeing’s videos, known as Webisodes in the industry, includes potential airline customers and passengers, as well as Boeing employees, aviation enthusiasts and frequent travelers.“Our goal is to show how this plane will make you feel better when you fly on it, compared to other planes, how the new technology allows passengers to have a better flight. The Webisodes give us a chance to convey this in a new way,” he said.Mr. Sarkissian said the videos’ ability to be downloaded and forwarded created “a viral aspect” for a marketer like Boeing that would enable it to “squeeze every dollar out of their expenditure.”“Viewers can copy the Webisodes and send them to a friend. When you receive something from a friend, you’re more likely to watch it than if you receive it from an advertiser,” he added.The first two videos have, in fact, already been downloaded and posted on video.google.com and youtube.com.They are part of a broader advertising and promotional push by Boeing for the 787. Four years ago, when it established newairplane.com, it ran a contest there asking the public to name the aircraft. Since 2003, it has been running print ads globally, in trade publications and newspapers like The Wall Street Journal, The Financial Times, The Seattle Post-Intelligencer and The Chicago Tribune, that highlight the plane’s innovations.And it has built a 54,000-square-foot Dreamliner Gallery, located in Everett, Wash., where Boeing says potential airline customers can “see, touch and experience the 787 catalog choices in a private, comfortable environment.”For example, the gallery lets them check out a full-scale cabin mockup, as well as different designs for furnishings, seats and galleys, where food is prepared.If you like In Advertising, be sure to read the Advertising column that appears Monday through Friday in the Business Day section of The New York Times newspaper.'"
"'07-04-24,'1','Maybe if we had resolved with miraculous speed the tensions besetting Israel — from Palestine, Lebanon, Syria, Iran — U.S. troops could have stayed in the Iraqis’ good graces. But neocons weren’t exactly pushing for dialogue on those fronts. They were going to let their new aircraft carrier, the U.S.S. Iraq, do the talking. And surely Iraq’s majority Shiites would applaud the use of their soil to threaten Shiite Iran, right?Meanwhile, neocons, and the Bush administration broadly, were endorsing the policies of Ariel Sharon, whose assertive policing of the occupied territories was proving counterproductive, helping to radicalize both Palestinian opinion and, via Al Jazeera, Muslim opinion globally.You can empower people through democracy if you want. You can systematically antagonize them if you want. Doing both at once is ill advised.Critics murmur that neoconservatism is “all about Israel.” I wish! Then the damage might be confined to one region. Alas, the neocon paradox — empower people and enrage them — is global. Neocons want to make China democratic ASAP; meanwhile, they pass the time arousing anti-American Chinese nationalism with vestigial cold war rants. Fortunately, they won fewer intra-administration battles over China than over the Middle East.Even if neocons weren’t bent on spreading democracy, their chronic inflammation of world opinion would be unhealthy, because much of the world is already democratic and more of it will probably become that way.But leave democracy aside. There’s another reason grass-roots opinion matters crucially.A confluence of technologies, from the Internet to biotechnology, is making it easier and easier for far-flung hatred to assume organized form, intersect with weapons technology and constitute unprecedently potent terrorism. This growing lethality of hatred may be the biggest long-term problem we face.Here’s a response favored by many left-of-center and right-of-center thinkers. Address the “demand side” — the desire to obtain and use nuclear and biological weapons — by reducing the number of people who hate the U.S. and the West. Address the “supply side” by improving arms control.Neocons take the opposite tack: degrade the arms control infrastructure (the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, the Biological Weapons Convention, etc.) and antagonize the masses.You can even do both at once! President Bush undermined the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty by agreeing to give nuclear technology to India, a nonsignatory. This ratcheted up anti-Americanism in Pakistan — a Muslim nation with nukes, jihadist recruiters and an unstable government.Neocons have their own formula for controlling arms: invade countries you think may have them. Of course, this approach will have to grow more cost-effective on repeated application if America is to warm up to it. But — who knows? — maybe we just need to make the next few wars more neoconservative.'"

"'07-04-25,'1','Our tax code is used to game the system for some at the expense of the many instead of encouraging the thrift, investment, innovation and industry of all Americans. Its complexity and waste costs Americans $140 billion in preparation and compliance costs each year. That's not good enough for America. And when I'm president, it won't be good enough for me. (Cheers, applause.)Our dependence on foreign sources of energy not only harms our environment and economy, it endangers our security. So much of the oil we import comes from countries in volatile regions of the world where our values aren't shared and our interests aren't a priority. That's not good enough for America, and it's not good enough -- when I'm president, it won't be good enough for me. (Cheers, applause.)We're not a country that prefers nostalgia to optimism. We're not a country that would rather go back than forward. We're the world's leader, and leaders don't pine for the past and dread the future. We make the future better than the past. Opening new markets to American goods and services is indispensable to our future prosperity. Lowering trade barriers creates more and better jobs, keeps inflation under control, keeps interest rates low, and makes more goods affordable to more Americans. We won't compete successfully by using old technology to produce old goods. We'll succeed by knowing what to produce and inventing new technologies to produce it.But open markets, open markets don't automatically translate into a better quality of life for every American. While most gain, some are forced to struggle with very difficult choices. Right now we have a half dozen programs to help displaced workers, another half dozen for people who aren't working at all. We have an unemployment insurance program that's right out of the 1950s, designed to assist workers through a few tough months during an economic downturn.That's not good enough for America. And when I'm president, it won't be good enough or me. (Applause.)These are some of the challenges that confront us. There are others just as urgent, and during this campaign I'll travel across the country offering my ideas about how we should address them and listening to the concerns and advice of Americans.The American people aren't interested in an election that offers platitudes instead of principles and insults instead of ideas; an election that results -- no matter who wins -- in four years of unkept promises and a divided government that is little more than a background -- battleground for the next election. They're tired of the old politics.Americans are acutely aware of our problems, and their patience is at an end for politicians who value incumbency over principle, and for partisanship that is less a contest of ideas than an uncivil brawl over the spoils of power. I want -- (applause) -- I want my presidency to be an opportunity, an opportunity to fix what we all know needs to be fixed:To strengthen our military, intelligence, diplomacy, and law enforcement and use the power of American ideals and commerce to win the war against violent extremists and help the majority of Muslims who believe in progress and peace to win the struggle for the soul of Islam.To balance the federal budget, not with smoke and mirrors but by encouraging economic growth and preventing government from spending your money on things it shouldn't; to hold it accountable for the money it does spend on services that only government can provide, and in ways that don't fail and embarrass you.To save Social Security and Medicare on our watch, without the tricks, band-aid solutions, lies and posturing that have failed us for too long while the problem became harder and harder to solve.To make our tax code simpler, fairer, flatter, more pro-growth and pro-jobs.To reduce our dangerous dependence on foreign sources of oil with an energy policy that encourages American industry and technology to make our country safer, cleaner and more prosperous by leading the world in the use, development and discovery of alternative sources of energy. To help Americans without health insurance acquire it without bankrupting the country and ruining the quality of American health care that is the envy of the world.When I'm president, I'll offer common sense, conservative and comprehensive solutions to these challenges. Congress will have other ideas, and I'll listen to them. I'll work with anyone who's serious and sincere about solving these problems. I expect us to argue over principle, but when a compromise consistent with our principles is within reach, I expect us to seize it. Americans expect us to disagree, but not just to win the next election. They want -- (applause) -- they want us to serve the same goal: to ensure that a country blessed with our matchless prosperity, ingenuity and strength can meet any challenge we confront.My friends, I won't judge myself by how many elections I've won but by how well I keep my promises to you. To keep those promises, I can't just win this election by a few votes in a few counties in a few states. I need a mandate from you big enough to convince Congress that Americans want this election to be different. You want to change the politics of selfishness, stalemate and delay, move the country forward and stake our claim on this century as we did in the last; then I ask you for the opportunity to devote every day of my presidency to making this government work for you and for a mandate big enough to get the job done. (Applause.)I'll challenge myself and each member of Congress to wake up each morning and ask ourselves: Will we remember today as the finest day of our public life, the day we worked just for you, not for us?And I'll challenge the American people to reject any phony sound-bite solutions that have failed us in the past, and hold us accountable for the work you have given us.My friends, we face formidable challenges. I'm not afraid of them; I'm prepared for them. I'm not the youngest candidate, but I am the most experienced. (Cheers, applause.) I know how the military works, what it can do, what it can do better, and what it should not do. I know how Congress works, and how to make it work for the country and not just the re-election of its members. I know how the world works. I know the good and the evil in it. I know how to work with leaders who share our dreams of a freer, safer and more prosperous world, and how to stand up to those who don't. I know how to fight and how to make peace. I know who I am and what I want to do. (Cheers, applause.)I don't seek the office out of a sense of entitlement. I owe America more than she has ever owed me. Thirty-four years ago, I came home from an extended absence abroad. While I was away, I fell in love with my country. I learned what's good for America is good enough for me. I have been an imperfect servant of my country ever since, in uniform and in office, in war and peace. I have never lived a single day, in good times or in bad, that I haven't thanked God for the privilege.My friends, you can't sell me on hopelessness. You can't convince me our problems are insurmountable. Our challenges are an opportunity to write another chapter of American greatness. We must seize it, and those of us privileged to lead America must remember the principles that made us great, have the faith to stand by them, the integrity to honor our public trust, and the courage to keep our promise to put the nation's interests before our own. Don't tell me what we can't do. Don't tell me we can't make our country stronger, and the world safer. We can. We must. And when I'm president, we will. (Cheers, applause.)I'm not running for president to be somebody but to do something, to do the hard but necessary things, not the easy and needless things. I'm running for president to protect our country from harm and defeat its enemies. I'm running for president to make the government do its job, not your job, to do it with less and do it better. I'm not running to leave our biggest problems to an unluckier generation of leaders, but to fix them now and fix them well. I'm running for president to make sure America maintains its place as the political and economic leader of the world the country that doesn't fear change but makes change work for us, the country that doesn't long for the good old days but aspires to even better days.I'm running for president of the United States, not yesterday's country, not a defeated country, not a bankrupt country, not a timid and frightened country, not a country fragmented into bickering interest groups with no sense of the national interest, not a country with a bloated, irresponsible and incompetent government. I'm running for president of the United States, a blessed country, a proud country, a hopeful country, the most powerful and prosperous country and the greatest force for good on earth. And when I'm president, I intend to keep it so. (Cheers, applause.)Thank you and God bless you.'"

"'07-04-25,'1','The director Robinson Devor apparently would like viewers who watch his heavily reconstructed documentary, “Zoo,” to see it as a story of ineluctable desire and human dignity. Shot on Super 16-millimeter film, with many scenes steeped in a blue that would have made Yves Klein envious, “Zoo” is, to a large extent, about the rhetorical uses of beauty and metaphor and of certain filmmaking techniques like slow-motion photography. It is, rather more coyly, also about a man who died from a perforated colon after he arranged to have sex with a stallion.Mercifully, you don’t see this death on camera, though if you sit close enough to the screen, you will see a few fairly brief images of one sexual event, accompanied by graphic sounds. It isn’t pretty, which is why the images appear only on a small television monitor. Art-house devotees may be a tolerant lot, but it’s doubtful they want to look at a stallion’s erect penis stretched across the big screen like a sailboat boom, at least in public. Certainly such an image would work directly counter to the self-conscious poeticism of Mr. Devor’s film, to its carefully confected narrative of misunderstood barnyard love and baleful testimonial. It is, after all, difficult to sing of the bodies electric and equine amid a chorus of “yucks.”It is, however, very easy to hide behind aestheticized imagery, as “Zoo” soon proves. Much has been made of the film’s look, and it’s easy to see why. The cinematographer, Sean Kirby, who also shot Mr. Devor’s “Police Beat,” a fiction film about a lovelorn Seattle bicycle cop, has done some striking work here. The prowling camera and dusky colors give much of “Zoo,” which opens with the portentous image of what appear to be miners emerging from a tunnel, a sumptuous, almost velvety look and vibe, an effect enhanced by the repeated use of slow-motion photography. Characters don’t just walk in this film; they float across the frame, pouring like liquid toward their inexorable destinies.Written by Mr. Devor and Charles Mudede, “Zoo” is nothing if not artful. Even before its premiere at the Sundance Film Festival in January, it had attracted a fair amount of attention that quickly morphed into a reassuringly familiar drone. Documentaries, particularly the kind shown at festivals like Sundance, tend to reaffirm the audience’s worldview, partly by appealing to its presumptive tolerance and partly by underscoring the artistry of the endeavor (the vision thing). Like many such documentaries, “Zoo” wraps its sensationalistic core in a seductive mantle, an approach that appeals to viewers already predisposed to art and the Enlightenment, “Sesame Street” and all things not Rush Limbaugh. These are films as documents of reason (yours, mine, the creators’), the cinema of indoor voices.In “Zoo,” three of those voices belong to men who, along with a group of unnamed, unnumbered other men, regularly met at a farm near the small city of Enumclaw, about 45 minutes southeast of Seattle, to party with one another and animals, occasionally recording their activities on video. Some of the men are identified only by their Internet handles (they met online), like the dead man, “Mr. Hands.” What Mr. Devor doesn’t explain until right before the end credits is that almost everyone who appears in his film, including most of the men who call themselves “zoos” — for zoophile or lover of animals — are played by actors. Structured like a mystery that taps many of the usual suspense beats, the story unwinds through dramatic reconstructions that show what happened, if not really why.'"
"'07-04-25,'1','“To keep those promises, I can’t just win this election by a few votes in a few counties in a few states,” he said. “I need a mandate from you big enough to convince Congress that Americans want this election to be different. You want to change the politics of selfishness, stalemate and delay; move this country forward and stake our claim on this century as we did in the last.”Mr. McCain spoke at what his aides viewed as a pivotal time in a candidacy that has gone through some difficult days. Mr. McCain has spent three years preparing for a campaign in which he had long been viewed as the presumptive frontrunner for his party’s nomination. But the announcement today had the feel of a re-launch, reflecting that Mr. McCain finds himself in the unexpected position of trailing rivals in some of early measures of the strength of a candidacy: particularly in fundraising, which Mr. McCain himself said today had been lackluster, and in early polls.Mr. McCain delivered his speech in flat tones and in front just a few hundred people who turned up for the outdoor event; he drew only a few rounds of applause. But his speech was laced with sharp rhetoric that appeared directed not only at Mr. Bush, but also at Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former mayor of New York whose early success — again, measured by fundraising and polls — has proved to nettlesome for Mr. McCain.Again without mentioning Mr. Giuliani by name, Mr. McCain sought to undercut what had been the former mayor’s biggest political claim to fame — his stewardship of New York City after the attacks of Sept. 11 — by noting the problems with firefighters’ radios on the day of the attack that made it impossible for city authorities to order rescue workers out of the Twin Towers.“When Americans confront a catastrophe, natural or man-made, they have a right to expect basic competence from their government,” he said. “They won’t accept that firemen and policemen are unable to communicate with each other in an emergency because they don’t have the same radio frequency.”Mr. McCain has spent much of the past two years trying to build his support from conservatives wary of his views. His speech today was notable for making no mention of issues of concern to social conservatives, such as abortion.As part of his effort to build support among conservatives, Mr. McCain had become a reliable cheerleader for Mr. Bush during these difficult few years. But as he talked about Americans expecting “basic competence” in their government, he referred to the government’s response to Hurricane Katrina and the treatment and neglect of returning Iraqi veterans at Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington D.C.Americans, he said, “won’t accept government’s failure to deliver bottled water to dehydrated babies or rescue the infirm from a hospital with no electricity. They won’t accept substandard care and indifference for wounded veterans.“That’s not good enough for Americans — and when I’m president it won’t be good enough for me.”Speaking at a jostling news conference in front of a bus that was about to take him across New Hampshire, Mr. McCain — who has served in Washington, both as a member of the House and in the Senate, since 1983 — made clear that he intended to run against Washington.“Americans are tired of gridlock in Washington, they want us to work together, they want Social Security and Medicare reform, they are tired of reading every day in the newspaper about some ethics scandal, or campaign finance corrupting influence,” he said.Mr. McCain, who is 70, made reference to his age as an issue, but tried to turn it against his main rivals, neither of whom has spent any time serving in Washington. “I’m not the youngest candidate,” he said. “But I am the most experienced. I know how the military works, what it can do, what it can do better, and what it should not do. I know how Congress works, and how to make it work for the country and not just the re-election of its members. I know how the world works.”Interviews with people in the crowd here suggested one of the problems Mr. McCain is encountering — that Mr. Giuliani is viewed as the new fresh face, as Mr. McCain was when he won the primary here in 2000, handing a big — though not fatal — defeat to Mr. Bush.Dave Connors, 62, from Hampton, N.H., wore a McCain sticker on his white windbreaker, but said that he did not know which candidate he would support — only that it would be a Republican. Asked which candidate he was leaning toward, he said: “Maybe more Rudy than anybody. I just think he’s a hell of a guy. And I like what he did after the Ground Zero attack, and the way he handled it.”'"
"'07-04-25,'1','In a letter to the civil rights division as well as to federal prosecutors in Brooklyn, Michael A. Cardozo, the city’s corporation counsel, said he was deeply disappointed by the findings, especially since the Fire Department had undertaken a $1.4 million recruitment campaign to diversify its ranks, including a revision of the very entrance exam that federal officials found discriminatory.Mr. Cardozo, writing of the Justice Department’s decision to authorize a suit, said, “It is simply a waste of federal and local resources and creates the totally unfair perception that the City of New York has failed to take steps to promote diversity in its fire department.”Mr. Cardozo seemed somewhat shocked in his letter that federal officials would pursue a lawsuit over what he called “old and no longer applicable tests.” On Jan. 20, the Fire Department introduced a new written entrance exam, and 40 percent of those who applied to take it were minority candidates, he wrote.Since the department started seeking a more diverse applicant pool, there has been an increase in minority candidates. In all, 3,810 black candidates took the test in January, three times the number of blacks who took it in 2002, Mr. Cardozo wrote. He added that 4,041 Hispanics took the test in January, two times the number who took it in 2002.“Given that the City of New York has voluntarily, and at substantial expense, undertaken these measures,” Mr. Cardozo wrote the Justice Department, “authorization of a lawsuit by your office is clearly ill advised at this time.”He concluded, “I ask that you reconsider the proposed lawsuit and agree to meet privately with representatives of my office to see if this matter can be resolved.”Fire Department officials said they had made great strides to diversify in the past few years, particularly during the tenure of the current fire commissioner, Nicholas Scoppetta. Since Mr. Scoppetta took over in 2002, the hiring of minority applicants has tripled, officials said.Last year, they said, the department began an advertising campaign to seek a more diverse crop of applicants. It also relaxed its qualifications for taking the entrance exam, deciding that applicants no longer needed 30 college credits to apply. (Either 15 college credits or a high school diploma with six months of work or military experience can now qualify an applicant for the test.)John Coombs, president of the Vulcan Society, said that little had changed in the department even under Mr. Scoppetta. He added that the entrance exam was still “slanted” against blacks and Hispanics, though he refused to explain precisely why.“The test is no true indicator of who will make a good firefighter,” Mr. Coombs said. “We shouldn’t be testing for anything more than one’s ability to be trained.”Still, he was hopeful that with federal intervention the department would change.“This is an opportunity for the Fire Department to grow and advance like the glorious city of New York.”'"
"'07-04-25,'1','The S.E.C. would not say whether other individuals could still face action. But its move against the two former executives could signal that the Justice Department is winding down a parallel criminal investigation into Apple’s handling of options. In other similar cases, like those involving Brocade Communications Systems and Comverse Technology, the two agencies filed charges against top executives at the same time. A Justice Department spokeswoman declined to comment.Unless the government can move beyond evidence of passive and indirect involvement, some legal experts say, a case against Mr. Jobs might be difficult to win.“Steve Jobs dodged a bullet,” said Mark C. Zauderer, a trial lawyer in New York specializing in white-collar cases. “This is another circumstance where the government is going after an easier target. It will generally shy away from situations where the evidence is ambiguous or subject to different interpretations.”Mr. Jobs’s lawyer referred requests for comment to Apple. The company simply expressed satisfaction that it would not face S.E.C. action and cited the agency’s praise of its “swift, extensive and extraordinary cooperation.”Ms. Heinen was accused of fraudulently backdating two separate stock options grants, providing recipients with attractive prices while allowing the company to avoid a $40 million charge against earnings. She also was accused of directing Apple’s legal staff to create phony documents to conceal the fraud.She declined to answer investigators’ questions, citing her Fifth Amendment rights, the S.E.C. said.Mr. Anderson reached a settlement over accusations that he should have noticed Ms. Heinen’s efforts to backdate one grant and failed to ensure that the company’s financial statements were accurate.Even though Apple said in December that a six-month inquiry had found “no misconduct” by its current management, it left crucial questions about a 2001 option grant made to Mr. Jobs unanswered, including who authorized, knew of and carried out a fabrication of board minutes to provide a foundation for the option grant date. Yesterday’s complaint helped fill some gaps but also left others.According to the complaint, Apple’s board granted 7.5 million stock options to Mr. Jobs on Aug. 29, 2001, to replace an earlier grant that had no immediate exercise value because the share price had declined. But Mr. Jobs was dissatisfied with the vesting terms of the new grant, and for the next three months, negotiations continued. Meanwhile, Apple started a new fiscal year at the end of September but had not disclosed the August grant to KPMG, its auditors.By the time Ms. Heinen recognized in mid-December that the “August 2001 grant date would no longer withstand scrutiny,” the complaint asserts, she recommended to Arthur D. Levinson, the chairman of Apple’s compensation committee, that it choose one of several dates in the new fiscal year that mimicked the Aug. 29 share price of $17.83.On Dec. 18, 2001, a day the stock closed at $21.01, Mr. Jobs and the compensation committee came to an agreement: the date of the 7.5 million-option grant would be Oct. 19, 2001, with an exercise price of $18.30.To cover up the backdated grant, the complaint asserts, Ms. Heinen directed her staff in January 2002 to document “a phony special meeting” of Apple’s board at which all directors except Mr. Jobs had met to discuss his pay on Oct. 19, 2001. In fact, no meeting had occurred.Ms. Heinen subsequently signed off on two other sets of previously approved board minutes, which she had altered in an effort to further conceal the backdating, the complaint says.In a statement, Miles Ehrlich, the lawyer for Ms. Heinen, said his client had not backdated options or deceived anyone inside or outside the company. “Every action Nancy took was fully understood and authorized by Apple’s board,” he said.The complaint also details an option grant in early 2001 that was made to six senior Apple executives, including Mr. Anderson and Ms. Heinen. While Apple finalized the terms of the 4.8 million option grant in February 2001, when its shares were trading at nearly $21, the complaint says, Ms. Heinen caused Apple to backdate the grant to Jan. 17, when Apple’s share price was $16.81.In the complaint, the S.E.C. asserts that on Jan. 30, Ms. Heinen provided Mr. Jobs with a list of daily closing share prices earlier in the month, when Apple’s share price was lower. The particular dates were selected, an e-mail message sent by Ms. Heinen said, to “avoid any perception the board was acting inappropriately for insiders prior to Macworld,” a trade show in early January at which the announcement of the iPod caused the stock to rise.Ms. Heinen, the S.E.C. contends, then had false paperwork prepared so Apple’s board could authorize the grant. On Feb. 1, the complaint says, Ms. Heinen asked directors to sign a “unanimous written consent” attesting that they had approved the grant as of Jan. 17.It was in connection with this grant that Mr. Anderson’s lawyer, Jerome Roth, said yesterday that in late January his client had “cautioned Mr. Jobs that the executive team grant would have to be priced on the date of the actual board agreement or there could be an accounting charge.”In his written statement, Mr. Roth went on to say that Mr. Anderson “was told by Mr. Jobs that the board had given its prior approval and that the board would verify it.”He said Mr. Anderson “relied on these statements by Mr. Jobs and from them concluded that the grant was being properly handled.”But the complaint asserts that Mr. Anderson was told by Ms. Heinen on Jan. 31 that prior dates were being considered, and responded, “Tuesday the 16th looks fine to me.”A days later, the complaint said, Ms. Heinen told Mr. Anderson that Mr. Jobs “had agreed to use Apple’s closing price on Jan. 17 for the Executive Team grant.”In an interview, Mr. Roth said he saw nothing inconsistent between the S.E.C. complaint and his statement about Mr. Anderson’s role. And citing confidentiality, he declined to say whether Mr. Anderson had provided government investigators with his account of his advice to Mr. Jobs.Mr. Anderson, a director from 2004 until last September, agreed to pay a $150,000 penalty and return about $3.5 million that reflects his gains from the backdating of the January 2001 grant. Ms. Heinen’s gain from the backdating of those options was $1.6 million, the complaint says.'"

"'07-04-25,'1','On the eve of his official announcement tour to declare his candidacy for president, Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, has replaced his finance director, a move that came after the campaign reported it had raised less than the party’s two other leading candidates.The fund-raiser who was let go, Carla Eudy, a longtime adviser, will be replaced by Mary Kate Johnson, a former Bush fund-raiser.The shakeup at the top of his financial apparatus follows the disclosure that Mr. McCain raised $13.7 million, less than Gov. Mitt Romney of Massachusetts, who raised $21 million, and Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former mayor of New York, who raised $16 million.The move underscores just how critical fund-raising is at this point for Mr. McCain. He coasted for several months as the presumed front-runner in the Republican field. But with his continued support for an unpopular war, his age (70) and some recent missteps, Mr. McCain has found himself lagging behind Mr. Giuliani in the polls.Mr. McCain started to step up his fund-raising pace a month ago and has built fund-raising events into his announcement tour, which will start in New Hampshire on Wednesday and take him through South Carolina, Iowa and Nevada before ending up in Arizona.'"

"'07-04-25,'1','LONDON, April 24 (AP) — BP, the European oil giant, reported a 17 percent drop in first-quarter earnings on Tuesday on lower oil prices and declining production.Net profit for the quarter fell to $4.66 billion (3.43 billion euros) from $5.62 billion (4.1 billion euros) in the first quarter a year ago. Revenue declined 3 percent to $62.04 billion (45.6 billion euros).BP was the first of the major European oil companies to report quarterly results, with most others expected to record declines in profit amid dwindling output and rising costs. However, analysts said the results put BP at the bottom of the pack, particularly given its safety troubles in the United States.As expected, total oil and gas production fell to 3.91 million barrels of oil equivalent a day, compared with 4.04 million a day a year earlier.An American oil company, Occidental Petroleum, posted a slight decline in first-quarter profit as crude oil production decreased and prices fell from levels a year ago.The oil and gas producer reported its net income fell to $1.21 billion from $1.23 billion a year ago. Earnings were flat at $1.43 a share, as Occidental lowered the number of its outstanding shares to 846.5 million from 860.9 million. Sales fell 7 percent to $4.1 billion, from $4.4 billion a year earlier.

"'07-04-25,'1','A senior department official, speaking on condition of anonymity because Mr. Gates has not made any final decisions, said Mr. Clapper was concerned about the negative publicity surrounding the Talon database and told Mr. Gates that the Pentagon could find other ways to assess threats to military installations.Mr. Clapper’s recommendation was first reported by Reuters on Tuesday.Civil liberties groups and some members of Congress criticized the database, which was run by the Pentagon’s Counterintelligence Field Activity office, suggesting it was an effort by the military to expand its domestic spying operations under the guise of combating terrorism.The Pentagon has long been restricted in conducting domestic intelligence operations and is barred from traditional law enforcement work.A lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union, Ben Wizner, called Mr. Clapper’s decision a “positive step” but said he was concerned that the Pentagon could carry out similar activity in the future under different names.“What we don’t know about Pentagon surveillance within the United States far exceeds what we do know,” Mr. Wizner said.Mr. Rumsfeld had long criticized the capabilities of American intelligence agencies and had moved during his tenure to improve and expand military intelligence collection worldwide. Both Mr. Rumsfeld and his intelligence chief, Stephen A. Cambone, were viewed with suspicion by many in the intelligence community who believed the Pentagon was trying a power grab from other spy agencies.Mr. Rumsfeld created the Counterintelligence Field Activity office, or CIFA, in 2002 to improve coordination of the military’s efforts to combat foreign intelligence services and terrorism groups inside the United States. Some civil liberties groups have criticized the office for its efforts to gather information inside the United States, but Pentagon officials have said that CIFA never violated department regulations prohibiting domestic spying.Most of what is publicly known about the Talon database came in documents released last year by the Pentagon in response to a request from the American Civil Liberties Union under the Freedom of Information Act.Among the database entries were one from February 2005 that noted that a “church service for peace” would be held in the New York City area and another revealing that military officials had labeled a March 2005 “Stop the War Now” rally in Akron, Ohio, a “potential terrorist activity.”Pentagon officials said last year that some of the controversial Talon reports had made it into the database by accident and that some had been kept in Talon past the 90 days that department guidelines allowed.The Pentagon purged more than 250 incident reports from Talon last year and tightened procedures to ensure that only actual terror threats were entered in the database.Mr. Gates, who once served as director of central intelligence, took office pledging to smooth over the Pentagon’s relations with the intelligence community. Early in his tenure he met with the directors of the other intelligence agencies and asked them to produce an assessment of programs that were working and those that were not.'"

Palmisano, chairman and chief executive, said in a speech to about 150 people at I.B.M.’s annual shareholder meeting.But Mr. Palmisano expressed confidence in the technology company’s global strategy, its potential in new software and microchip markets, its acquisitions and its overall reshaping since shedding its personal computer business nearly two years ago.It has been exactly one year since I.B.M.’s last quarterly dividend increase, to 30 cents a share, from 20 cents.

"'07-04-25,'1','Paul E. Erdman, a writer of best-selling novels of financial intrigue who began his literary career in the comfort of a Swiss jail, where he was being held in connection with the collapse of the Swiss bank he ran, died on Monday at his ranch in Healdsburg, Calif. He was 74.The cause was cancer, his family said.An economist and former Lutheran seminarian, Mr. Erdman was widely regarded as having popularized financial fiction, a genre he affectionately called fi-fi. Among his best-known novels are “The Billion Dollar Sure Thing,” “The Crash of ’79” and “The Panic of ’89.”Mr. Erdman was in all likelihood one of the few novelists whose books were routinely reviewed — often glowingly — in Business Week and The American Banker as well as in mainstream publications. His novels featured exotic locales, shadowy cartels and lots and lots of money.Paul Emil Erdman was born on May 19, 1932, in Stratford, Ontario, to parents who had moved there from the United States. (Mr. Erdman’s father, a Lutheran pastor, had a pulpit in Stratford.)In 1954, Paul Erdman earned a bachelor of divinity degree from Concordia Seminary in St. Louis, followed the next year by a second bachelor’s, from the Georgetown University School of Foreign Service. After a stint at The Washington Post, he earned a doctorate in economics, European history and theology from the University of Basel, in Switzerland, in 1958.'"

"'07-04-25,'1','WASHINGTON, April 24 — Melamine, the chemical suspected in the deaths of pets around the country, was in food given to hogs and chickens in several states, and the Food and Drug Administration is trying to determine if the animals entered the human food supply, F.D.A. officials said Tuesday.Several thousand hogs have been quarantined and are being tested. The affected farms are in California, New York, North Carolina, South Carolina, Utah and possibly Ohio. A poultry farm in Missouri is also under investigation.Hog urine has tested positive for melamine in several of those states after it was determined that the animals ate salvaged pet food that originated in factories that produced the tainted food. It is common in the United States to take pet food that does not meet quality standards and reconstitute it into livestock feed, Stephen Sundlof, the F.D.A.’s chief veterinarian, said in a conference call with reporters.The food and drug agency, which is already testing wheat gluten and rice protein for melamine, the chemical used to make plastic utensils and as a fertilizer in other countries, said Tuesday that as a precaution, it was expanding testing of imported ingredients and finished products that contain cornmeal, soy protein, rice bran and corn gluten. Those ingredients can be used to make many products, including breads, pastas, pizza dough, baby formulas, protein shakes and energy bars.The agency also expanded the time frame in which the products might have been in the food supply. Tainted wheat gluten began coming into this country in November. But other tainted products may have started coming in as early as July, when one of the importers changed to a new supplier in China, an F.D.A. official said.Binzhou Futian Biological Technology and the Anying Biological Development Company are under investigation by Chinese officials. China has barred the two companies from exporting products and has invited the F.D.A. to meet with the Chinese government, said Julia Ho, the associate director for Asia and the Pacific in the agency’s Office for International Programs.'"

"'07-04-25,'1','WARSAW, April 24 — Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates was told Tuesday that the Polish government supported proposals to base 10 American missile interceptors on its soil, but only so long as Poland’s security was enhanced along with that of Western Europe.The Polish defense minister, Aleksander Szczyglo, chose the words carefully in expressing his government’s desire to move forward with negotiations for an American missile defense base, clearly hinting that the eventual price to the United States could be an even broader range of security guarantees.“We came to a common conclusion that this U.S. project should first and foremost serve to increase the level of security in Europe and, in this case, specifically in Poland,” he said.The United States argues that the interceptor base under discussion for Poland and a tracking radar proposed for the Czech Republic are to counter the possibility of missiles from Iran. But some officials in both of those former Soviet bloc states make no secret that one rationale for supporting the plan is to more closely tie the United States to their security as a hedge against potential Russian pressure.But by proceeding with negotiations over the antimissile bases, Poland in particular risks provoking even more concern from the Kremlin, of the type that Mr. Gates heard Monday and Tuesday during his visit to Moscow.The two stops by Mr. Gates underscored how the Bush administration would have to manage difficult negotiations in the months ahead, dealing with harsh complaints from Russia and complications from other countries as it moves forward with its plans to add missile defense sites in Europe.'"

"'07-04-26,'1','Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, speaking in Oslo at a gathering of top diplomats from NATO countries, reacted coldly to Mr. Putin’s speech. “These are treaty obligations, and everyone is expected to live up to treaty obligations,” she said.Ms. Rice also dismissed Russian concerns that introducing new military technology to Europe could upset the balance of forces there and set off an escalation that could lead to a new cold war. She called such claims “purely ludicrous” and said the scale of the proposed missile defense system was obviously far too small to defend against the Russian nuclear arsenal.Though the step by Mr. Putin was incremental, it was highly symbolic and reminiscent of brinkmanship in the cold war.The agreement in question, the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe, known by the initials C.F.E., was signed in 1990 by the members of NATO and of the Warsaw Pact, including Russia.It required the reduction and relocation of much of the main battle equipment then located along the East-West dividing lines, including tanks, artillery pieces, armored vehicles and attack aircraft. It also established an inspection regime.Under the treaty more than 50,000 pieces of military equipment were converted or destroyed by 1995. With its initial ambitions largely achieved, it was renegotiated in 1999, adding a requirement that Russia withdraw its forces from Georgia and Moldova, two former Soviet republics where tensions and intrigue with Moscow run high.Russia has not withdrawn its troops, and the revised treaty has not been ratified by most of the signing nations, including the United States, which has withheld ratification until the Kremlin complies with the troop withdrawal commitments.Though in many ways the treaty has already stalled, it has remained a powerful diplomatic marker, a central element in the group of agreements that defused the threat of war in Europe as Communism collapsed.Jaap de Hoop Scheffer, NATO’s secretary general, expressed dismay at the Kremlin’s decision, saying the alliance greeted Russia’s announcement with “concern, grave concern, disappointment and regret” and calling the treaty “one of the cornerstones of European security.”Mr. Putin abruptly called the treaty’s future into question. In doing so, he pointedly did not use any of the conciliatory language he sometimes inserts into his speeches to leaven his criticisms of the United States.He did not define specifically what he meant by a moratorium, nor did his foreign minister, Sergey V. Lavrov, when asked in an appearance in Oslo whether Russia might resist inspections or shift conventional forces now that it was no longer observing the treaty. “Everything will be in moratorium,” Mr. Lavrov said. “It is clear, is it not?”Mr. Lavrov’s hard-line position in public was preceded by what one senior American official described as a “riveting” session with NATO diplomats in private. In an intense 10-minute monologue, he presented a list of grievances about NATO and its role in the world, from its enlarged membership to the missile defense system.The officials said Mr. Lavrov’s tone prompted stern responses from several NATO members. “The push-back was universal,” the official said, “including some countries that have been reserved about missile defense. It did not have the effect that he may have anticipated.”The back-and-forth underscored the intensity and breadth of the dispute, and the degree to which the two sides have parted.Mr. Putin and Mr. Lavrov warned that Russia might withdraw completely from the treaty if the Kremlin was not satisfied with the results of negotiations in the NATO-Russia Council, an organization created in 2002 to increase cooperation between the former enemies.“I propose discussing this problem,” Mr. Putin said, “and should there be no progress in the negotiations, to look at the possibility of ceasing our commitments under the C.F.E. treaty.”His comments drew the loudest applause of the day from Russia’s largely compliant Parliament, which for the most part sat quietly during his 70-minute speech.The Russian president’s remarks coincided with the latest effort by the Bush administration to promote its missile defense system, which it says is necessary to protect Europe if diplomacy fails to deter Iran from developing nuclear weapons. The system would take at least several years to install and be put into operation, American officials say, and the project would be running on a parallel clock against Iran’s suspected weapons program.Mr. Lavrov said forcefully that Russia saw no such danger, and that in any event Russia, Europe and the United States should assess the region’s strategic risks jointly. “Our starting point is that we should conduct a joint analysis of whom we should protect ourselves against,” he said. “Who are our enemies?”He added: “We cannot see at the moment any kind of justified threat.”American officials were equally adamant in dismissing Russia’s contention that the system would threaten its security.“The idea that somehow 10 interceptors and a few radars in Eastern Europe are going to threaten the Soviet strategic deterrent is purely ludicrous, and everybody knows it,” Ms. Rice said, slipping inadvertently into cold war terminology with her reference to the Soviet Union.Aside from the military issues, Mr. Putin chided the West for what he called meddling in Russia’s domestic affairs in the guise of democracy promotion efforts.The argument simultaneously evoked old times and raised questions about how, and through whom, the latest disagreement might be resolved. Mr. Putin restated to the Parliament his intention to leave office next year, at the end of his second four-year term, which would mean that the issues raised on Thursday could well fall to a successor.The Russian Constitution limits the president to a maximum of two terms, but there have been calls by politicians loyal to Mr. Putin to set the rule aside and let him remain in office, and speculation has never fully subsided that he might do so. But on Thursday, Mr. Putin was clear about his intentions, saying this annual address was his last.“In the spring of next year my duties end, and the next state of the nation speech will be delivered by a different head of state,” he said.The disagreement with the West seemed certain to extend well into that next term. “On missile defense,” Mr. de Hoop Scheffer said, “we do not see eye to eye.”'"
"'07-04-26,'1','OSLO, April 26 — Brusquely dismissing protests by Russian officials, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said here on Thursday that a missile-defense system the United States plans to install in Poland and the Czech Republic would pose no danger to the security of Russia.“The idea that somehow 10 interceptors and a few radars in Eastern Europe are going to threaten the Soviet strategic deterrent is purely ludicrous, and everybody knows it,” Ms. Rice said before a meeting of NATO foreign ministers expected to focus on the missile-defense dispute.“The Russians have thousands of warheads,” Ms. Rice said. “The idea that you can somehow stop the Soviet strategic nuclear deterrent with a few interceptors just doesn’t make sense.”Still, Ms. Rice said the United States would continue discussing the system with Russian officials, in an effort to “demystify” it. She planned to meet the foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, later on Thursday.Ms. Rice’s comments came as President Vladimir Putin declared in Moscow that Russia would no longer honor its obligations under the Conventional Forces in Europe Treaty. The decision, he said, was a response to Western threats, including the planned missile-defense system.The secretary of state’s comments are part of a broader campaign by the Bush administration to rally support for the system, which Washington says is meant to protect Europe from missiles fired by Iran.'"

Arnold Schwarzenegger said. The state applied in 2005 for a waiver that would exempt California from the federal Clean Air Act, allowing it more aggressive regulation of heat-trapping gases like carbon dioxide as air pollutants. Mr. Schwarzenegger said he called the E.P.A. administrator, Stephen Johnson, and told him that his agency was moving too slowly. A letter announcing the intent to sue, a procedural step required six months before a lawsuit would be filed, was being sent yesterday, said a Schwarzenegger spokesman, Aaron McLear.'"
"'07-04-26,'1','The two men combined their marketing and financial talents during the late 1990s to save Apple when it was at the brink of bankruptcy. When Mr. Anderson left as chief financial officer in 2004 to become a venture capitalist, they were on good terms.“Steve and Fred were great buddies from 1997 to 2004,” said Charles Wolf, president of Wolf Insights, an investment consulting company that has covered Apple for years.Many in Silicon Valley, therefore, were scratching their heads on Wednesday. Why would Mr. Anderson go out of his way to tarnish Mr. Jobs after he had been let off with a relatively light penalty? Although he was forced to give back $3.5 million, that is a fraction of the tens of millions that he garnered in his time at Apple.One widely discussed possibility was that the Justice Department was still considering a case against Mr. Jobs, and that Mr. Anderson had waited until his own case was settled to avoid suspicion that he was testifying to save himself.But there was an equally held belief that Mr. Anderson had simply been stewing for months, outraged at his forced resignation from the board in the wake of an internal investigation.“Fred’s reputation was impugned by Apple,” said Roger McNamee, a managing director at Elevation Partners, the venture capital firm where Mr. Anderson is a colleague. “All he is doing now is responding — with facts. And he is doing so in the most diplomatic way possible.”On Wednesday afternoon, Apple’s board responded, issuing a statement reiterating that Mr. Jobs had cooperated with Apple’s own inquiry and with federal investigators.“The S.E.C. investigated the matter thoroughly and its complaint speaks for itself, in terms of what it says, what it does not say, who it charges, and who it does not charge,” the board’s statement said.Moreover, a crucial S.E.C. official in the agency’s San Francisco office emphasized Mr. Anderson’s own responsibility.“From our standpoint, the key fact in assessing Mr. Anderson’s liability is that regardless of what he may or may not have believed, he had before him e-mails that stated the price was picked with hindsight and that the board’s authorization was dated on a date when no event occurred,” said Marc J. Fagel, associate regional director for the commission. “Based on that, he should have done more to ensure the financial statements were accurate.”Mr. Wolf, the investment consultant, said Mr. Anderson was viewed as a straight shooter with stand-up ethics. But he said that the suggestion that blame for the backdating problems lay with Mr. Jobs did not wash. Whatever Mr. Jobs might have told Mr. Anderson about the handling of options, “it’s Fred’s responsibility to take care of the issue,” Mr. Wolf said.Mr. Anderson came to Apple from the minicomputer and data processing industries and was instrumental in keeping the company afloat during its darkest days before Mr. Jobs returned to Apple in 1997.The computer maker then revived during the dot-com boom. But in 2000, when the Internet bubble was bursting, Apple’s stock took an immense tumble, and Mr. Jobs and Mr. Anderson worked together to bring stability and to rebuild the company around the consumer electronics industry and the wildly successful iPod.After leaving Apple in 2004 to become a co-founder of Elevation Partners, based on Sand Hill Road in Menlo Park — Silicon Valley’s venture-capital row — Mr. Anderson was involved again in a potential crisis when the stock-option backdating issue exploded last summer. Still a member of Apple’s board, he volunteered to spend a month sorting out the company’s past stock-option practices, an associate briefed on the events said.The associate said Mr. Anderson did so at the time not because Apple was suspected of having a problem but because many major companies were trying to understand their practices in case they did face scrutiny or accusations.Last fall, however, the accusations around Apple’s practices started to snowball. In October, Mr. Anderson resigned from the board. Several people close to Apple’s investigation said he had essentially been forced out.At the time, the company said its stock-option accounting problems were attributable to two former employees, an allusion that was widely interpreted as referring to Mr. Anderson and the former general counsel, Nancy R. Heinen, who was also sued by the S.E.C. this week.In October, with the assistance of his partners at Elevation, Mr. Anderson retained the public relations firm Sard Verbinnen, which is often called in to help in hardball situations like litigation and mergers and acquisitions. (Among its contributions on Wednesday was this testimonial to Mr. Anderson from the Irish rock star Bono, a managing director and co-founder of Elevation: “He is a man to whom you would give the keys to your life and know it would be calmer, tidier and better organized every day he was in it.”)Mr. McNamee, his Elevation colleague, said in an interview that Mr. Anderson had been deeply hurt by insinuations from Apple that he was responsible for the option accounting problems.He said the comments by Mr. Anderson’s lawyer were an attempt to clear Mr. Anderson’s name and “set the record straight in a way that has not been possible because of the pending legal action.”John Shoch, a veteran venture capitalist at Alloy Ventures in Palo Alto, Calif., was trying to sort it all out.“You get into this he-said, she-said situation and you have to worry about who was paying attention and what the subtleties were,” he said. “This whole thing may reflect a smoking gun somewhere.” But he conceded that he had no idea where it might be.'"
"'07-04-26,'1','Engine 151 and Ladder 76 in Staten Island, known collectively for years as Southern Comfort, were told to change their moniker after a sangria- and beer-fueled firehouse brawl in late 2003 over the date of Elvis Presley’s birthday.The fight ended with one firefighter smashing the other in the face with a metal folding chair. Criminal and departmental charges followed.The Happy Hookers of Red Hook’s Engine 279 were also told to change their name about a year ago.“The uniform means a great deal, and anyone in it should treat it with great respect,” said Francis X. Gribbon, a former firefighter and current Fire Department spokesman.The patches are now regulated, and the colors and designs are subject to approval by a borough fire commander. They can be no bigger than 3 ¾ inches wide and 4 ½ inches high.Engine 151 dropped Southern Comfort and is now South Shore Pride. Engine 75, the former Animal House, and Engine 279, once the Happy Hookers, have yet to replace their old nicknames.Names like Happy Hookers were once nonissues, sophomoric plays on words referring to neighborhoods or to hook and ladder tools. “But in this day and age, things are different,” Mr. Gribbon said.Referring to the Staten Island brawl and the Bronx sex scandal, he said, “No question, it was after those incidents that this review took place And it was decided that things like Southern Comfort, because of its obvious connotation, was not appropriate.”A report by the city Department of Investigation in 2005 found that in addition to Animal House, a few other firehouses had adopted “equally unbecoming nicknames.” Among the others it listed were Engine 214 in Brooklyn (the Nut House), Ladder 30 in Harlem (the Harlem Zoo), Engine 90 in the Bronx (90 Proof) and Engine 315 in Queens (Clown College).As for Animal House, investigators did their best to figure out where the name came from. When asked if the namesake was the popular 1978 movie “Animal House,” which depicted a drunken bunch of hard-partying fraternity boys, firefighters gave wildly different answers.One said the name came from “the era when fire engines were pulled by horses.” Another said the name stemmed from a firehouse mascot, a Muppets character named Animal. Still another said the nickname may have come from their predecessors’ kind approach toward animals, when the firehouse was “home to stray dogs and rodents,” the report said.The review of patches echoes another recent controversy surrounding firefighters’ lockers. In that case, department brass ordered that everything but a firefighter’s name be stripped from lockers, including stickers of American flags. The policy came about after incidents involving racially or sexually offensive material. Pictures of naked women or otherwise questionable material was torn from locker doors.The Uniformed Firefighters Association, which fought and won the right of firefighters to display American flags, pictures of relatives and other noncontroversial items on their lockers, did not return phone calls to comment on the patch issue.The review of patches dug deep into the culture of the department; firefighters see the patches as a way of channeling the spirit of those who have come through the house before them to those who will come after. They are a means of finding comedy in tragedy, strength when strength is feigned and a sense of personality where uniformity is expected.“We like to identify with the smaller group,” said Lt. Paul Conboy of Engine 218’s Bomberos in Bushwick, Brooklyn. “We’re proud to be part of the bigger Fire Department as a whole, but this gives us a little bit of individuality.”The patches are worn on the right sleeve, opposite the department’s official patch, which shows the city skyline and a red flame circled in red. They are optional; some firefighters wear them on their bunker coats, others on their dress uniforms. The tighter the company, firefighters say, the more patches you will see.On a recent afternoon at the Bomberos’ house on Hart Street, Lieutenant Conboy scanned a large framed poster of Fire Department patches hanging in the watch room.There were patches with Popeye, flaming skulls, Snoopy, bulldogs and an assortment of fierce-looking creatures. There were patches with firehouse nicknames and slogans, like the Bedford Express, the Fighting Forty-Four, the Tillary Street Tigers and the Tin House. There were eagles and shamrocks and a bunch of hooks, hoses and ladders.“Some people make fun of other companies’ patches, but I think ours is pretty good,” Lieutenant Conboy said.The Bomberos were anointed 20 or 25 years ago, he said. The residents of the largely Hispanic neighborhood had long called them the bomberos, or firefighters in Spanish. While out on calls they would hear people screaming, “Bomberos, bomberos!”Then a cousin of a firefighter in the house came up with the idea of a patch and a design and rallied the approval of the others. The design shows a firefighter with a big hat and mustache, flames burning behind him, looking as if he is prepared, with itchy fingers, for a Wild West shootout. But instead of guns in holsters are two water hoses.In Midtown Manhattan, at the firehouse of Engine 54 and Ladder 4, Rich Kane, a second-generation firefighter, mused on a neighborhood woman in her 70s who wears the firehouse’s patch draped around her neck.After the Sept. 11 attacks, she would come by the firehouse, on Eighth Avenue in the theater district, and tend to the flowers being left by mourners. She soon became a fixture outside the firehouse. From time to time she still drops by. “She walks around the neighborhood wearing our patch like a necklace,” Firefighter Kane said. “For us, it’s a pride thing.”Their patch shows a large theater marquee with the engine and ladder numbers. Below it are the comedy and tragedy masks, framed by the phrase “The Pride of Midtown, Never Missed a Performance.”'"
"'07-04-26,'1','“Americans are acutely aware of our problems,” he said, “and their patience is at end for politicians who value incumbency over principle, and for partisanship that is less a contest of ideas than an uncivil brawl over the spoils of power.” He added, “They’re tired of it.”Although he did not mention Mr. Bush by name in his 20-minute speech, delivered under slate-gray skies and before an often listless crowd in Portsmouth, Mr. McCain systematically distanced himself from the White House and from his major Republican competitors.His remarks suggested a sharp strategic shift after months of trying to build support with conservative voters in part by presenting himself as a champion of Mr. Bush and his natural heir.That strategy has exposed him to questions about his ideological consistency and whether he had sacrificed his political identity in an effort to overcome skepticism about him among the conservatives who helped Mr. Bush win the White House twice.Mr. McCain at first only hinted that on Thursday he might call for the resignation of Mr. Gonzales. Asked by reporters if he still supported Mr. Gonzales, he responded, “I’ll tell you tomorrow,” explaining that he did not want to “step on my message.”In fact, Mr. McCain stepped on his message hours later when he sat down to tape an interview with Mr. King for CNN. When Mr. King asked if he thought Mr. Gonzales should step down, Mr. McCain responded, “I think that out of loyalty to the president that that would probably be the best thing that he could do.”His criticisms seemed aimed not only at the record of the Bush administration but also at the political strategy that became its hallmark in 2000 and 2004: winning by pumping up support among base voters.“I’m running for president of the United States,” Mr. McCain said. “Not yesterday’s country, not a defeated country, not a bankrupt country, not a timid and frightened country, not a country fragmented into bickering interest groups with no sense of the national interest, not a country with a bloated, irresponsible and incompetent government.”“To keep those promises, I can’t just win this election by a few votes in a few counties in a few states,” he said. “I need a mandate from you big enough to convince Congress that Americans want this election to be different. You want to change the politics of selfishness, stalemate and delay; move this country forward and stake our claim on this century as we did in the last.”Mr. McCain’s aides said that though distancing himself from Mr. Bush, he was to some extent insulated from a backlash from Mr. Bush’s supporters because of his defense of the president’s decision to send more troops to Iraq.They also suggested that in talking about such issues as the response to Hurricane Katrina, the quality of care for military personnel at Walter Reed Medical Center and the management of the war, he was giving voice to the opinions of even Mr. Bush’s strongest supporters.Mr. McCain spoke at a pivotal time in a candidacy that has gone through some difficult days. He has spent three years preparing for a campaign in which he had long been viewed as the presumptive front-runner for his party’s nomination.But the announcement Wednesday had the feel of a restart, reflecting Mr. McCain’s relative weakness in some early measures of strength, including his fund-raising.Mr. McCain, 70, made reference to his age as an issue, but tried to turn it against his main rivals. “I’m not the youngest candidate,” he said. “But I am the most experienced.”He delivered his announcement speech in Portsmouth, speaking in flat tones and in front of just a few hundred people who turned up for the outdoor event. He repeated it at the end of the day in Manchester to a crowd pelted by a cold rain and where he was interrupted by a small but loud group of war protesters.In the speech, he devoted only a few sentences to Iraq, the issue that as much as any has defined his candidacy, though he answered extensive questions from reporters on the topic later.He affirmed his contention that the war was justified and said he was not giving any thought to what impact it might have on his political ambitions.Mr. McCain’s speech was also notable for not mentioning issues of concern to social conservatives, including abortion.At one point, Mr. McCain appeared to take a jab at Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former mayor of New York, whose early success as candidate for the Republican nomination — a candidacy built in large part on Mr. Giuliani’s handling of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks — has proved troublesome for Mr. McCain.Mr. McCain noted that emergency workers at the World Trade Center in New York on the day of the attacks were unable to communicate with one another as well as they should have been able to.“When Americans confront a catastrophe, natural or man-made, they have a right to expect basic competence from their government,” he said. “They won’t accept that firemen and policemen are unable to communicate with each other in an emergency because they don’t have the same radio frequency.”Mr. McCain’s aides later said that the remark, which echoed some criticism that has been directed at Mr. Giuliani concerning New York’s preparedness for a catastrophe, was not aimed at Mr. Giuliani, but rather at the federal government for its role in regulating the assignment of radio frequencies.'"
"'07-04-26,'1','“Even if the Supreme Court does not understand the law, we do,” Mr. Spitzer said, appearing briefly at a Manhattan luncheon held by Naral Pro-Choice New York. “New York State will continue to be a beacon of civil rights and protection of women’s rights.”The governor cut short his appearance after learning of the shooting death of a state trooper in upstate New York on Wednesday morning, leaving his wife, Silda Wall Spitzer, to deliver the text of his speech, which calls for legislation that “would enshrine the protections of Roe v. Wade into New York State law.”New York’s abortion law, signed in 1970 by Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller, a Republican, predates the Roe v. Wade decision by three years and made New York the second state after Hawaii to broadly legalize the procedure and the first to allow abortions for out-of-state residents. In the first two years, more than half the women having abortions came from out of state.But the law is now considered out of date by abortion rights advocates.The issue is clearly a personal one for the governor. His mother, Anne, is a board member of a foundation affiliated with Naral and received a lifetime achievement award at the luncheon.Abortion rights advocates hailed the proposed legislation as a critical step in light of the Supreme Court’s ruling, but it is also one whose purpose could be seen as insurance if the Supreme Court upholds stricter regulation of abortion. The state bill would not change current abortion practices, nor would it have any effect on the procedure covered by the federal ban, which is known medically as “intact dilation and extraction.”“New York’s laws have to be impeccable,” said JoAnn Smith, president and chief executive of Family Planning Advocates of New York State. “The Supreme Court said last week that a woman’s health doesn’t matter, and with very carefully crafted legislation today, Governor Spitzer said it does.”But Lori Kehoe, a spokeswoman for the New York State Right to Life Committee, called the governor “a bully with an insatiable appetite and tunnel vision to accomplish his fierce agenda.”“We can only hope the Senate will get back their courage and begin to stand up for the children with as much fervor and devotion as Governor Spitzer has shown for making sure they can be destroyed,” she added.Neither the Assembly nor the Senate was familiar with the details of the proposal, though it could be expected to be received warmly in the Democratic-led Assembly and much less so in the Senate, whose majority is Republican.John McArdle, a spokesman for the Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno, said: “The governor’s top issues for the rest of the session are overturning an abortion decision that has not been made, delivering same-sex marriage and campaign finance reform. Our priorities continue to be dealing with the state’s economy, jobs, reducing taxes and making sure cops don’t get killed when they’re on the job.”The federal Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act that was upheld last week allows an abortion to save the woman’s life, but not simply when her health is at risk, a step that dismayed groups like the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.Ms. Wall Spitzer said, “Eliot’s bill would encapsulate protections similar to those afforded by Roe, that a pregnant woman has the right to an abortion in two circumstances; first, prior to viability of the fetus, and second, at any time when necessary to protect her life or her health.”Eve Gartner, deputy director of litigation and law of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America, said that although state law could not supersede the Supreme Court’s ruling last week, she believed that the governor’s proposals would make doctors feel more secure when considering a range of abortion procedures.“I think that without having this clear health exception, they would feel that maybe they might delay treatment for a little while until the woman worsened,” she said. “If New York law had a clear health exception, I think they would feel more comfortable that they could proceed.”'"
"'07-04-26,'1','Mr. Jobs noted that Dell had recently returned an earlier version of Windows to its product line, which he said was an indication that demand for Vista had not been overwhelming.Apple reported revenue of $5.26 billion, an increase of more than 20 percent over the $4.36 billion in the same period last year. Profit increased to 87 cents a share from 47 cents.On average, analysts were expecting earnings of 64 cents a share on sales of $5.17 billion for the quarter, according to a survey by Thomson Financial.Apple executives said the company benefited from lower component costs, as well as surging demand for notebook computers. Of Apple’s total computer sales, 59 percent were notebooks.The earnings report sent shares of Apple up more than 7 percent to $102.40 in after-hours trading on Wednesday, topping the $100 mark for the first time. The shares rose $2.11 to close at $95.35 in the regular trading session.It was Apple’s profitability during the quarter that most impressed Wall Street analysts. Its gross profit margin reached 35.1 percent, up from 29.8 percent in the year-ago quarter. Company executives said it was the company’s most profitable second quarter ever. Sales typically slow in the second quarter as it comes between the holidays and buying for school in the fall.“They’re defying the laws of gravity when it comes to profitability,” said Eugene A. Munster, an analyst at Piper Jaffray.Peter Oppenheimer, Apple’s chief finance officer, told analysts that he expected gross margins to decline during the third quarter, to about 32 percent. Apple tends to sell lower-margin computers to school districts in the third quarter, and component prices are also expected to be higher, he said.In the third quarter the company expects revenue to climb to about $5.1 billion and earnings to reach about 66 cents a share, slightly lower than analysts’ forecasts.Mr. Munster said the appeal of the Macintosh was clearly expanding beyond its traditional niche. “There’s a global shift in how people see personal computers — for entertainment, creativity and good looks,” Mr. Munster said. “Apple has found that sweet spot, and with almost no competition.”Apple said Mac sales accounted for 56 percent of revenue during the second quarter, with music-related products, including iPod and iTunes sales, accounting for the other 44 percent.Apple sold 10.5 million iPods during the quarter. Earlier this month Apple said it had sold a total of 100 million iPods.Apple had earlier said it was delaying the release of the next version of its Mac operating system, called Leopard, because it needed to divert resources to its iPhone project. The iPhone is scheduled to ship in late June, through an agreement with Cingular, and cost between $500 and $600.Mr. Oppenheimer said Apple planned to regularly add new software features to iPhones after they are sold, at no charge, and would alter its accounting policies to make this possible. In the interview, Mr. Jobs said he believed these upgrades would give the company an advantage in a market where the software in phones generally remains unchanged once they are in use.Apple said it ended the second quarter with $12.6 billion in cash.'"
"'07-04-26,'1','As the House Oversight Committee voted along party lines to approve the subpoenas, the atmosphere in the room was rich with themes of retribution and settling scores.Republicans said the Democrats were using their new majority to support “fishing expeditions” and “witch hunts” solely to embarrass President Bush.Representative Tom Davis of Virginia, the committee’s ranking Republican, said the subpoenas were “an effort to get high-profile administration figures under oath, before the cameras, for the sake of political theatrics.”Representative Henry A. Waxman of California, the recently installed committee chairman, savored his new status as he turned aside Republican efforts to quash the subpoenas or limit them. Reflecting on the years when Republicans controlled the oversight committee during Bill Clinton’s presidency, Mr. Waxman said more than 1,000 subpoenas were issued to the executive branch.“When President Bush took office, I saw the other extreme,” he said.The Republicans who controlled the committee issued only four subpoenas in six years to executive agencies, Mr. Waxman said, none directly to the Bush White House.The ability to investigate is part of Congress’s authority to conduct oversight of the executive branch, separate from its better-known function of enacting legislationIn joining the battle Wednesday, Mr. Waxman received committee approval to subpoena both the Republican National Committee and its chairman, Robert M. Duncan.The subpoenas are intended to explore the R.N.C. e-mail accounts used by at least 37 White House employees and find out if agencies other than the General Services Administration received improper political briefings from the White House. On Jan. 26, a senior aide to Mr. Rove briefed G.S.A. employees about which Democratic members of Congress the Republican Party hoped to unseat in 2008.Blair Jones, a White House spokesman, said Wednesday night that White House officials provided 20 briefings about Republican electoral prospects for senior officials in various agencies in 2006 and 2007. He said the briefings, first reported by The Washington Post in its Thursday editions, were given by members of the political affairs staff including Sara Taylor and Scott Jennings.“It’s entirely appropriate for the president’s staff to provide briefings to appointed officials throughout the government about the political landscape in which they implement the president’s policies and priorities,” Mr. Jones said. Republicans tried to amend the motion seeking the subpoena to include records from the Democratic National Committee. In arguing that case, Mr. Davis suggested that the sauce appropriate for a goose could also be used with a gander.He also objected to seeking testimony from Ms. Rice, saying that in previous Congressional appearances she had answered all possible questions about prewar intelligence.Tony Fratto, the deputy White House press secretary, responded more caustically. He said Ms. Rice could not testify about her advice to the president while she was his national security adviser.“Beyond that, there may be no more singularly analyzed and exhaustively studied and testified issue than the one Chairman Waxman wants to dredge up again,” Mr. Fratto said.When Ms. Rice arrived in Oslo, Norway, on Wednesday for a meeting with NATO ministers, she declined to comment on the subpoena.Ms. Goodling’s testimony about the dismissal of the United States attorneys could be revealing because of her regular interaction with the White House, which has rebuffed requests by Congressional investigators to turn over documents or make available White House officials for sworn interviews.Representative John Conyers Jr., the Michigan Democrat who leads the Judiciary Committee, said of Ms. Goodling on Wednesday before the committee’s action, “She was apparently involved in crucial discussions over a two-year period with senior White House aides and with other senior Justice officials in which the termination list was developed, refined and finalized.”Committee officials said it would be at least a month before Ms. Goodling testified, because the Justice Department would have a chance to respond to the request.In San Diego and Arizona, corruption investigations created peril for Republicans, and in Seattle and New Mexico, some Republican leaders argued that local prosecutors were not taking action on voter fraud.Suspicion intensified this week that politics might have played a role in the ouster of the former United States attorney in Phoenix, Paul K. Charlton. News reports have said that the Justice Department may have held up an investigation of Representative Rick Renzi, Republican of Arizona, who is facing accusations that he used his influence as a congressman to engineer a land swap benefiting a business associate.Lawyers close to the case, confirming an article that appeared Wednesday in The Wall Street Journal, said the department had been slow to approve search warrants or other crucial steps in the investigation, which had started in 2005.“I don’t have sufficient knowledge to venture a judgment on the question of whether it is related to politics,” said Fred Petti, an Arizona lawyer and former federal prosecutor involved in the case. “But I have been surprised at how slowly the matter has progressed.”In response to the reports, Brian Roehrkasse, a Justice Department spokesman, denied any impropriety.“The Department of Justice under Attorney General Gonzales has never interfered with or attempted to influence a criminal prosecution, including a public corruption case, for partisan political reasons,” Mr. Roehrkasse said.'"
"'07-04-26,'1','CHICAGO, April 25 (AP) — The Boeing Company said Wednesday that its first-quarter earnings climbed 27 percent, mostly as a result of robust orders for commercial airplanes and strong military business.Boeing said it earned $877 million, or $1.13 a share, in the quarter, up from $692 million, or 88 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue climbed 8 percent, to $15.4 billion from $14.3 billion, beating Wall Street forecasts.The company said its backlog climbed 23 percent to a record $262 billion, lifted by strong commercial plane and military orders.Boeing’s chief executive, W. James McNerney, said the results were in line with the company’s expectations for the last quarter and that the company was “on track to achieve our growth and profitability objectives.”Boeing’s profit topped the $1.01 a share expected by Wall Street analysts but some called the performance mixed, particularly because the company left its 2007 forecast unchanged.“Some investors may be disappointed that guidance, which remains well below consensus expectations, did not improve,” a JPMorgan analyst, Joseph B. Nadol III, wrote in a research note.'"
"'07-04-26,'1','But the buses were not available when Jeffrey Maron, who lives in Stamford and works at a financial firm near Wall Street, arrived at Stamford Station around 7 a.m. to take his usual express to New York. Instead, he and two other commuters paid a total of $60 to take a 10-minute cab ride six stops down the line to Rye.A Metro-North employee had said trains were running from Rye. But Mr. Maron said that when his group arrived, there were no trains, only several announcements that said one was on the way. At least twice, they were told to switch platforms. One express came through the station heading to New York but did not stop.When a train did arrive after 8 a.m., “it was packed to the gills,” he said. “We literally stood on the train like cattle. It was worse than the Lexington Avenue subway.”Service on the New Haven Line was also delayed because Metro-North had to return all its cars to their proper positions, Ms. Anders said.Greenwich, one of the wealthiest communities in the New York metropolitan region, has one of the busiest stations on the New Haven Line and is home to many white-collar workers employed in New York City. Stamford, four stops farther east, is a major transportation hub, and many financial institutions have set up offices there. Amtrak riders were also affected because they share Metro-North tracks.Jim Cameron, the chairman of the Connecticut Metro-North New Haven Rail Commuter Council, a rider advocacy group, said that the equipment failure was understandable, but that the railroad’s response afterward was not. He complained that riders were given contradictory information about when service would resume and what alternative routes they could take.“Stuff happens with infrastructure,” Mr. Cameron said. “But where they failed is on the communication efforts. There was a lot of confusion. It’s the classic issue we deal with over and over.”'"
"'07-04-26,'1','Mr. Fukuyama said he supported the Bush administration’s overall strategy of encouraging Japan to be more assertive diplomatically and strengthening the two countries’ military alliance.But he said Japan should move cautiously in revising its pacifist Constitution — a goal that Mr. Abe has defined as his most important, and Washington has supported.“Everybody, including the Japanese themselves, says that nobody should be worried about Japan revising its Constitution,” Mr. Fukuyama said. “I think that is basically right. But the Japanese have to make their case. It’s not about letting China or Korea have a say in this matter. The Japanese need to take time in their public diplomacy to explain why they want to do this. If they do this unilaterally, the situation in Asia could get a lot worse.”At home, Mr. Abe’s approval ratings appear to have bottomed out after falling precipitously for several months over a series of scandals and complaints of weak leadership.But because Mr. Abe has succeeded in reasserting himself recently and because the main opposition party is in disarray, he is likely to remain head of the governing Liberal Democratic Party and prime minister after a critical election of the upper house of Parliament in July, experts said.“His popularity was dropping because he lacked management skills and his policies didn’t have a clear direction,” said Jun Iio, a professor of government at the National Graduate Institute for Policy Studies here. “But the likelihood that his administration will stabilize is very high as long as Prime Minister Abe shows steady results.”Before becoming prime minister, Mr. Abe made a name for himself inside Parliament by spearheading conservative issues like excising references to Japan’s wartime abuses from school textbooks. Among voters, he drew his popularity by championing the cause of more than a dozen Japanese citizens abducted by North Korea in the 1970s.As prime minister he has been trying to balance the demands of his conservative base with those of his new job, often by finessing difficult issues. A onetime regular visitor to the Yasukuni Shrine, the memorial for Japan’s fallen soldiers, including war criminals, Mr. Abe says he will neither confirm nor deny whether he has visited as prime minister. That has placated China for now.“All the expectations of Abe pointed to somebody who was not only going to continue Mr. Koizumi’s foreign policy, but harden what were already difficult relations with Japan’s neighbors,” said Richard J. Samuels, a Japan expert at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. “But he surprised everyone” by reaching out to China.It is on North Korea that differences have widened between Washington and Tokyo. Mr. Abe has long said that Japan will not take part in any nuclear agreement, including the accord reached on Feb. 13, unless the North returns Japanese abductees. The North says it has returned all surviving Japanese.His tough stance, which dovetailed with the Bush administration’s previous policy toward the North Koreans, has remained unchanged despite Washington’s new efforts to strike a deal with the North.“Abe and his allies are clearly in dismay that the neocon rug was pulled from under them last fall,” said Gerald L. Curtis, a Columbia University expert on Japanese politics who is now in Japan, referring to the Republican loss of Congress and the resulting decline in influence of neoconservatives. “Now he has to find a way to get on board this nuclear agreement.”That will be difficult, Mr. Curtis said, because the abduction issue has become tied to Mr. Abe and Japanese nationalism. “So if it seems like he’s selling the abductees down the river, he’s dead,” Mr. Curtis said.Before the change in policy toward North Korea, Mr. Bush made symbolic gestures supporting the abductees, including inviting a relative to the White House. In a recent visit to Japan, Vice President Dick Cheney met relatives. But according to the news media here, Mr. Cheney also asked Mr. Abe what he would consider progress on the abduction issue, suggesting that Washington wanted Japan to support the nuclear deal.“Americans have paid lip service to the abductions, but they’re not going to let it get in the way of realizing a nuclear deal,” Mr. Samuels said. “Japan is marginalized on this issue.”On Monday, perhaps anticipating that he would be asked the same question in Washington, Mr. Abe struck a tough stance. “Whether there’s progress or not on the abduction issue, that’s something we will decide,” Mr. Abe told reporters.On the domestic front, Mr. Abe has pushed to extract Japan from what he calls its “postwar regime.” He has revised the basic law of education by emphasizing patriotism and has moved to change the Constitution.His ideological allies, whom Mr. Abe appointed to top posts in government and the governing party, have pushed even harder for long-cherished nationalist goals. One was to rescind a 1993 declaration acknowledging that the Japanese military had coerced women into sex slavery during the war. Nationalists here have long argued that the so-called comfort women were voluntary prostitutes, despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary.In a nod to his base, Mr. Abe said there was no evidence that the military had coerced the women, but added that the 1993 declaration would remain in effect. After his comments caused anger in Asia and the United States, Mr. Abe apologized.But despite many verbal contortions, he has not taken back the point most important to his political base, his denial of coercion by the military.“He made a good gesture in the beginning by visiting Korea and China, but then he made a completely unnecessary comment about the comfort women,” said Ahn Yinhay, a Northeast Asia expert at Korea University. “Because of his basic stance, his distortion of history, relations between Korea and Japan will likely remain strained. I don’t see any dramatic improvement in the future.”'"
"'07-04-26,'1','A special three-judge Federal District Court here ruled that because the text and images of the advertisements did not show that they were “intended to influence the voters’ decisions,” they were “genuine issue ads” that the government could not keep off the air.Solicitor General Paul D. Clement, arguing on behalf of the Federal Election Commission, told the justices that if these advertisements qualified for an exception to the law’s ban on issue ads that mention a candidate for federal office right before an election, so would many or most others, leaving the statute “wide open.” Describing the advertisements as typical of those the court had reviewed as part of the record when it rejected the initial challenge to the law, he said that a finding that these could not be regulated “just seems inconsistent” with the earlier ruling.Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. turned the solicitor general’s argument against him. It was Mr. Clement who was being inconsistent, the chief justice said, noting that in an earlier phase of this case a year ago, the Supreme Court had ruled that the provision could be challenged “as applied” on a case-by-case basis.If the Roberts court were writing on a clean slate, a broad declaration of unconstitutionality might well be the result. But the court’s 2003 decision in McConnell v. Federal Election Commission, upholding the law, is so recent as to make such a bold step unlikely. Instead, many election law experts believe the fate of the statute may depend on how broad an exception the court carves out through its handling of this or future “as applied” challenges.The four dissenters from the 2003 decision were Justices Antonin Scalia, Anthony M. Kennedy and Clarence Thomas, all of whom are still on the court, and Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist. Chief Justice Roberts appeared fully prepared to step into his predecessor’s shoes. So all eyes were on the court’s other newcomer, Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr., who as the successor to Justice Sandra Day O’Connor, a co-author of the 2003 decision, probably holds the balance.For the first half-hour of the argument, Justice Alito said nothing, leaning forward in his seat at the end of the bench with an intense expression. He finally intervened during the argument by Seth P. Waxman, who was defending the law on behalf of a group of its Congressional supporters including Senator John McCain, the Arizona Republican who is the other lead sponsor.What would happen, Justice Alito asked Mr. Waxman, if a group had been running an advertisement about an issue, “and let’s say a particular candidate’s position on the issue is very well known to people who pay attention to public affairs.” Suppose the blackout period established by the law was approaching — 30 days before a primary or 60 days before a general election — “and an important vote is coming up in Congress on that very issue.” Could the group be prohibited from continuing to broadcast the ad?That would depend on the context, Mr. Waxman replied.Justice Alito did not appear satisfied. “What do you make of the fact that there are so many groups that say this is really impractical?” he asked. His reference was to the impressive array of ideological strange bedfellows that filed briefs in support of Wisconsin Right to Life’s challenge. These range from the American Civil Liberties Union to the National Rifle Association to the United States Chamber of Commerce to the AFL-CIO.“I love it!” Mr. Waxman replied energetically, as if he had been waiting for just such a question. He said that although these many groups opposed the law, they were living with it and contenting themselves with running advertisements that advocated their positions on issues without mentioning candidates. The only two as-applied challenges, he noted, had both been brought by Wisconsin Right to Life’s lawyer, James Bopp Jr., who also has another case pending before the court.Chief Justice Roberts was unimpressed by this line of argument. “I think it’s an important part of their exercise of First Amendment rights to petition their senators and congressmen and to urge others to, as in these ads, contact your senators, contact your congressmen,” he said, adding, “Just because the A.C.L.U. doesn’t do that doesn’t seem particularly pertinent to me.”The law’s most vigorous defense from the bench came from Justices Stephen G. Breyer and David H. Souter. “If we agree with you in this case, good-bye McCain-Feingold,” Justice Breyer told Mr. Bopp. His point was that there is an inextricable link between the law’s two major provisions, the advertising restriction and the ban on the receipt and expenditure by political parties of unregulated “soft money” from corporations and unions. If corporations can underwrite television ads, which are “the single best way to get somebody defeated or elected,” Justice Breyer said, then “forget the rule that corporation’s can’t contribute.”The statute permits corporations and unions to pay for ads from segregated funds called political action committees, whose donors’ names are disclosed and whose contributions and spending are regulated, rather than directly from their treasuries. Mr. Bopp argued that this restriction was unduly burdensome.The significance of the eventual ruling in this case, Federal Election Commission v. Wisconsin Right to Life, Inc., No. 06-969, may depend on what standard the court sets for distinguishing genuine issue ads from the “electioneering communications” that the law seeks to regulate.The district court’s decision said that judges should restrict themselves to examining the “four corners” of the ad itself: if its language does not exhort viewers to take action, it passes the test and must be permitted even if the message, seen in a broader context, was perfectly clear.Mr. Bopp said this restriction was essential so that an ad’s validity would be “reasonably ascertainable” in advance and not depend “upon the varied understandings of the listener.” The only test is “what do the words say?” he said.The law’s supporters argue that many “sham” issue ads will escape regulation unless courts can evaluate them in the context in which voters will understand them. “The question is, what do the words mean?” Justice Souter told Mr. Bopp, adding: “It is impossible to know what the words mean without knowing the context in which they are spoken.”'"
"'07-04-26,'1','After the ceremony, Mr. Yeltsin’s body was taken under military guard to the Novodevichy Cemetery. There, to the strains of the Soviet national anthem — which Mr. Yeltsin had retired but Mr. Putin quickly restored — he was interred.At the cemetery, he will lie in the company of other mavericks, cultural and political, including the Soviet writer Mikhail A. Bulgakov, and Nikita S. Khrushchev, the Soviet leader who, like Mr. Yeltsin, left office humbled and with a taint of official shame.Mr. Putin, whom Mr. Yeltsin appointed as head of state when he resigned on New Year’s Eve in 1999, declared Wednesday an official day of mourning, and in a sign of the Kremlin’s increasing grip on the media, ordered television stations to cancel entertainment programs and to broadcast the funeral.Beginning Tuesday afternoon, thousands of Russians and foreigners came to the cathedral to pay their respects to Mr. Yeltsin.Awaiting entrance to the cathedral on Tuesday was Kirill B. Mikhailov. In August 1991, at the age of 18, Mr. Mikhailov spent three days outside the White House in Moscow, supporting Mr. Yeltsin’s drive against the organizers of a coup to oust the Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev.“He rid us of Communism,” Mr. Mikhailov said of Mr. Yeltsin. “He gave us freedom.”But he will also be remembered as the man who, after his initial triumph over the Soviet Union, led Russia into a corrupt, chaotic and increasingly lawless era.“Yeltsin was the embodiment of a new freedom, a new spirit,” said Vera A. Colman, who also came to say goodbye. “Then began a period of banditry.”His order to shell the Communist-controlled Parliament in 1993, his decision to invade Chechnya in 1994, the rise of a rapacious oligarchy, and the financial collapse in 1998 weakened him and marred his legacy.In a sign that political scars from the 1990s have yet to heal, members of the Communist Party, Mr. Yeltsin’s main political opponents during his presidency, refused to rise during a moment of silence before the start of Wednesday’s session at Parliament. Some of the party’s deputies walked out.President Putin’s Kremlin, which has been strongly critical of the Yeltsin era, has adopted a respectful, if reserved, tone.Speaking at a Kremlin reception after the funeral, Mr. Putin said Mr. Yeltsin had inspired historic changes in Russia and had transformed the world. “Boris Nikolayevich was able to do this without once retreating or deviating from or betraying the people’s choice or his own conscience,” Mr. Putin said.The Kremlin-controlled media gave extensive, emotional, even intimate coverage of the proceedings. At the cemetery, state television showed Mrs. Yeltsin approach her husband’s open coffin, pat his head and give him a last kiss.'"
"'07-04-26,'1','Miri Eisin, a spokeswoman for Mr. Olmert, said the prime minister “totally and absolutely” denied the allegations against him. The prime minister’s office issued a sharp response saying Mr. Olmert had “lost faith in the state comptroller,” whose actions with this and other reports “have sadly broken all records of unprofessional behavior.”The report is another blow for Mr. Olmert, whose popularity ratings are already in single digits. The state comptroller is also looking into suspicions of corruption regarding the prime minister’s purchase of a house in Jerusalem, the state comptroller’s spokeswoman said. And Israeli police are investigating suspicions that Mr. Olmert tried to influence the sale of a bank when he was finance minister in late 2005, the police spokesman confirmed.Mr. Olmert temporarily took over the finance portfolio again this week after his finance minister, Abraham Hirchson, asked for a three-month leave of absence pending the outcome of a separate police investigation. Mr. Hirchson is suspected of embezzling millions of dollars before he joined the government, police officials have said.The state comptroller’s report comes days before the publication of an interim report by a government-appointed committee into the failings of the political and military leadership during the war last summer in Lebanon. The report is widely expected to be critical of the prime minister; the defense minister, Amir Peretz; and the wartime army chief of staff, Dan Halutz, who has already resigned.The investigation by the police and the Shin Bet internal security service against the Israeli Arab politician, Mr. Bishara, is continuing, the police spokesman said. But Mr. Bishara has been out of the country for weeks and it is unclear if or when he will return. He submitted his resignation from Parliament in a letter sent via the Israeli Embassy in Cairo.“He is delaying his return until things become clearer,” said Jamal Zahalka, a lawmaker from Mr. Bishara’s Arab nationalist party, Balad, shortly after the court partially lifted the gag order on the investigation.Mr. Zahalka said Mr. Bishara “utterly denies” the suspicions against him. “This is a political case,” Mr. Zahalka said. “This is not only about Mr. Bishara, but it is about the Arab minority as a whole and its political future.”Mr. Bishara, an outspoken and controversial figure in Israel, pioneered the notion that Israel’s definition of itself as a “Jewish and democratic state” is a contradiction in terms. He has called for Israel to become a “state of all its citizens” instead. Much of the political and intellectual leadership of Israel’s Arab minority, which is largely Muslim and makes up 20 percent of the total population, now subscribes to the idea.Mr. Bishara was questioned by the police at the end of March, before leaving the country for what he said would be a number of days, the police spokesman said. Since Mr. Bishara has resigned from Parliament he has lost his immunity and could be arrested on arrival in Israel.If Mr. Bishara “does not turn up for further questioning,” the police spokesman said, the attorney general will have to decide at some point whether to press charges based on the existing evidence.Separately, on Wednesday afternoon, Mr. Olmert met with leaders of the defense and military establishment to discuss options for Israel’s response to Hamas’s launching of rockets and mortar shells at Israel on Tuesday.It was the first time that Hamas, which dominates the Palestinian unity government, had launched such an attack since it committed itself to a cease-fire in Gaza last November. A spokesman for Hamas’s military wing said the cease-fire was over, though more moderate Hamas politicians called for it to continue.In a statement after the meeting, the Israeli prime minister said Israel would not hesitate to take “harsh steps” against those who fired rockets. But Israel “is not talking now about launching a large-scale offensive in Gaza,” said Ms. Eisin, the prime minister’s spokeswoman. “In the meantime, we are working on the diplomatic front” to show that Hamas “is directly involved in terrorism,” she said.'"
"'07-04-26,'1','While Sheogorath’s subjects fret about being watched or complain incessantly about the evilness of cats, the prince is more concerned with the coming of Graymarch, a kingdom-decimating event that occurs once every thousand years. Coincidentally, the player arrives just about a thousand years since the last one.Sheogorath promptly recruits the player to save his kingdom, which over the course of the game involves cutting keys out of the stomach of an invincible gatekeeper, assassinating royalty and leading troops into battle.The quests that make up the game vary in quality. Some are rather ingenious, as when you must explore a dungeon that can be entered only by taking an addictive substance that will ravage the player’s health if not regularly ingested. And there is an intriguing side quest where you must help ghosts continuously reliving a lost battle to win it at last. But there are too many times where you simply have to go fetch some artifact in some dungeon, battling monsters with swords or magical staffs or creatures that you can summon into battle, and then go fetch something else.Fortunately, this is still a lot of fun because Elder Scrolls IV was a brilliant game and Isles stays very much in the spirit of the original. There are some fun new weapons, like a sword that becomes more powerful as it takes lives, and I was amused by the prince’s rants like: “The cat’s out of the bag. Who puts cats in bags? Cats hate bags.”When not battling monsters, the player is asked to take on some unsavory tasks. At one point, the player becomes a grand inquisitor who uses torture to gain information. I was disappointed that the game didn’t offer less evil alternatives; Elder Scrolls IV allowed players to decide how moral they wanted to be, but Isles just wants you to be bad.The game does ask the player to make choices, but they seem best decided by a coin toss, as there are no practical or moral reasons to choose a particular path. While a theme of duality runs through the game, it is more narrative conceit than game-play enhancement.While Isles lacks moral depth, Intelligent Systems’ ingenious Super Paper Mario manages to show a great deal of depth while remaining paper thin.At first glance, Super Paper Mario looks like an old-fashioned two-dimensional arcade platformer as Mario the plumber jumps from platform to platform or bounces on monsters to vanquish them. But Mario has the ability to look at this two-dimensional world in three dimensions. Suddenly, Mario is looking down a hallway at monsters as thin as a slip of paper that he can casually walk bySeemingly solid platforms turn out to be several different platforms carefully arranged so that from a side view they appear as a single entity. Previously hidden passages are revealed in the floor or running off at right angles, and objects can be found behind paper-thin boulders.It’s a brilliant idea that feels a little like conceptual art, a commentary on superficiality and hidden depth that is also a wonderful game-play mechanism.Like a lot of Mario games, this one begins as the villainous King Bowser kidnaps the lovely Princess Peach. Before Mario can save her, the crisis is interrupted by Count Bleck, a mysterious figure who randomly uses “bleck” as an adjective, adverb or noun and who is bent on destroying the universe.Mario soon learns that he is the prophesied hero of a book called The Light Prognosticus and the only one able to stop Count Bleck. Unless, of course, the true book is The Dark Prognosticus, in which case the universe is doomed. To find out which book is truly prophetic, Mario must find seven artifacts called Pure Hearts to counter Count Bleck’s Chaos Heart.Mario is helped in this quest by Pixls, odd little creatures that tag along and let Mario blow things up or shrink himself to the size of a pea. He is also joined by companions with various skills; Princess Peach, for example, can use her parasol like a hang glider to bridge long gaps.Eighty percent of Super Paper Mario is wonderful, so it’s a shame that the other 20 percent is so annoying. Every time Mario finds a Pure Heart he must return to the town of Flipside to attach it to a heart pillar. Pillars are distributed throughout Flipside, and finding them is a grind. In town you can also buy health and attack items, but if you want to get their full effect you will have to take them to a cook who will transform each item during a dull animation that you must sit through over and over again.At times the game goes out of its way to annoy the player, as when you must hit a series of floating blocks following a tiresome series of instructions or type out the word “please” over and over on a virtual keyboard. Parts of the game are remarkably tedious, like a series of easy duels that wears out its welcome by the first duel. The game also refuses to let you skip expository scenes you’ve already witnessed, which is particularly unfortunate since the story and dialogue are rather dull.While all this keeps Super Paper Mario from being a great game, the imaginative level design, clever ideas and varied locations still make it a very good one. And the central 3-D gimmick is endlessly amusing; it’s fascinating to see what’s beneath the surface. Which, to answer the question so elegantly posed at the beginning of this column, is why things look better with the skin off.'"
"'07-04-26,'1','It would be impossible to build one computer to please everyone, but Toshiba’s new Satellite A205-S4617 notebook sure takes a whack at it. It is powered by an Intel Core 2 Duo processor running at 1.66 gigahertz and has 2 gigabytes of RAM, which is what you need to run all the features of Windows Vista’s Home Premium edition.The computer has four USB 2.0 ports and one FireWire port. Toshiba says it set the USB ports far enough apart to accommodate bulky devices that would normally block the use of the adjacent port.For audiophiles, the S4617 has built-in Harman Kardon speakers. The 15.4-inch screen is in the 16:9 format that is favored for viewing and editing high-definition widescreen video, and it has a resolution of 1280 by 800 pixels. To help the budding filmmaker handle all that video, the unit comes with a 250-gigabyte hard drive. The 5-in-1 media reader can handle the most common storage cards used in digital cameras and camcorders.The S4617 is available for less than $1,250. While it is not the lightest notebook, weighing less than 7 pounds, it does have a shiny black case with electric-green display lights. STEPHEN C. MILLER'"

The Epson PowerLite Home Cinema 1080, however, costs about as much as a large-screen TV and lets you project a 100-inch HD picture on any wall.The Home Cinema 1080 supports 1080p resolution — or 1,920 pixels by 1,080 pixels — and connects to HDMI-compatible devices like HD-DVD and Blu-ray disc players. It has a 12,000:1 contrast ratio and projects at a bright 1,200 lumens.The projector can be mounted on the ceiling and its lens can be configured to ensure a sharp, evenly aligned picture in any position. Its lamp has low and high settings and offers about 3,000 hours of viewing time before it needs replacing.While most HD projectors cost more than $4,000, the PowerLite Home Cinema, which is available now from stores and online retailers, is about $3,000.

"'07-04-26,'1','Most insiders point out that reality shows cost much less to make than scripted shows, and, they argue, this is just a profit play by the broadcast networks.But that does not explain why reality shows did not take over television long ago — why, back in the day, “Star Search” never became “American Idol.” Surely the broadcast networks wanted to save money back then, too.In his book “Switching Channels” (Harvard University Press, 2005), Richard E. Caves, the don of entertainment economics and professor emeritus at Harvard, blames (or credits, depending how old you are) cable and satellite providers and the way they have changed the broadcast networks’ incentives to invest in programming.He points out that such incentives depend on the size of the potential market. The programming is a fixed cost — networks pay for the programs even if nobody watches. If paying an extra $1 million to get a star onto a show, for example, raises every customer’s love of the show by the equivalent of $1, the investment more than pays off if there are 10 million potential viewers. But the $1 million investment would be a terrible flop if there were 10,000 potential viewers.You can see the mechanism at work in a comparison of the cable networks. The number of subscribers for a given channel (that is, the households who have that channel available on their system) gives a clear indication of a network’s maximum potential market. And the bigger the market, the more a cable network spends on programs.Not even counting sports juggernauts like ESPN (whose annual expenses on programming top $3 billion), industry analysts say that the average programming costs at networks with more than 90 million subscribers — networks like Discovery, Nickelodeon or MTV — average more than $250 million a year.Networks like Bloomberg, Nicktoons, and National Geographic, with 40 million to 50 million subscribers, average less than $35 million in annual programming costs. Fledgling networks with 20 million to 25 million subscribers, like Boomerang, the Sleuth Channel or the Anime Network, average only about $12 million.Spending on programming is not linear in the sense that doubling the potential market more than doubles the amount that networks spend on their shows.With the big shift to cable and satellite television (we now watch more cable than broadcast programs), cable networks have had a big incentive to upgrade their product, while the incentive for broadcast networks has moved in the opposite direction.So the increase in reality programming is not just a matter of broadcasters wanting to save money. It’s that a shrinking potential market gives the networks less incentive to spend money. They can’t recoup it with enough viewers.Nor is the shift to cable and satellite complete. It continues. And now, more and more people are also turning to the Internet and YouTube instead of broadcast television. So you can see how this ends.You may be like Kinga Tompos, calling in and voting to give Sanjaya the boot. But remember the economist’s dictum: you don’t know what something costs until you have seen the alternative. Celebrate Sanjaya’s demise all you want. But just wait until you see what’s next.'"

"'07-04-26,'1','A special three-judge Federal District Court here ruled that because the text and images of the ads did not show that they were “intended to influence the voters’ decisions,” they were “genuine issue ads” that the government could not keep off the air.Solicitor General Paul D. Clement, arguing on behalf of the Federal Election Commission, told the justices that if these ads qualified for an exception to the law’s ban on issue ads that mention a candidate for federal office right before an election, so would many or most others, leaving the statute “wide open.”Describing the ads as typical of those the court had reviewed when it rejected the initial challenge to the law, Mr. Clement said that a finding that these could not be regulated “just seems inconsistent” with the earlier ruling.Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. turned the solicitor general’s argument against him. It was Mr. Clement who was being inconsistent, the chief justice said, noting that in an earlier phase of this case a year ago, the Supreme Court ruled that the provision could be challenged “as applied” on a case-by-case basis.If the Roberts court were writing on a clean slate, a broad declaration of unconstitutionality might well be the result. But the court’s 2003 decision in McConnell v. Federal Election Commission, upholding the law, is so recent as to make such a bold step unlikely. Instead, many election law experts believe the fate of the statute may depend on how broad an exception the court carves out through its handling of this or future “as applied” challenges.The four dissenters from the 2003 decision were Justices Antonin Scalia, Anthony M. Kennedy and Clarence Thomas, all of whom are still on the court, and Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist. Chief Justice Roberts appeared fully prepared to step into his predecessor’s shoes. So all eyes were on the court’s other newcomer, Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr., who as the successor to Justice Sandra Day O’Connor, a co-author of the 2003 decision, probably holds the balance.For the first half-hour of the argument, Justice Alito said nothing, leaning forward in his seat at the end of the bench with an intense expression. He finally intervened during the argument by Seth P. Waxman, who was defending the law on behalf of a group of its Congressional supporters including Senator John McCain, the Arizona Republican who is the other lead sponsor.What would happen, Justice Alito asked Mr. Waxman, if a group had been running an ad about an issue, “and let’s say a particular candidate’s position on the issue is very well known to people who pay attention to public affairs.” Suppose the blackout period established by the law was approaching — 30 days before a primary or 60 days before a general election — “and an important vote is coming up in Congress on that very issue.” Could the group be prohibited from continuing to broadcast the ad?That would depend on the context, Mr. Waxman replied.Justice Alito did not appear satisfied. “What do you make of the fact that there are so many groups that say this is really impractical?” he asked. His reference was to the impressive array of ideological strange-bedfellows that filed briefs in support of Wisconsin Right to Life’s challenge. These range from the American Civil Liberties Union to the National Rifle Association to the United States Chamber of Commerce to the A.F.L.-C.I.O.“I love it!” Mr. Waxman replied energetically, as if he had been waiting for just such a question. He said that although these many groups opposed the law, they were living with it and contenting themselves with running advertisements that advocated their positions on issues without mentioning candidates. The only two as-applied challenges, he noted, have both been brought by Wisconsin Right to Life’s lawyer, James Bopp Jr., who also has another case pending before the court.Chief Justice Roberts was unimpressed by this line of argument. “I think it’s an important part of their exercise of First Amendment rights to petition their senators and congressmen and to urge others to, as in these ads, contact your senators, contact your congressmen,” he said, adding, “Just because the A.C.L.U. doesn’t do that doesn’t seem particularly pertinent to me.”The law’s most vigorous defense from the bench came from Justices Stephen G. Breyer and David H. Souter. “If we agree with you in this case, goodbye McCain-Feingold,” Justice Breyer told Mr. Bopp. His point was that there is an inextricable link between the law’s two major provisions: the advertising restriction and the ban on the receipt and expenditure by political parties of unregulated “soft money” from corporations and unions. If corporations can underwrite television ads, which are “the single best way to get somebody defeated or elected,” Justice Breyer said, then “forget the rule that corporations can’t contribute.”The statute permits corporations and unions to pay for ads from segregated funds called political action committees, whose donors’ names are disclosed and whose contributions and spending are regulated, rather than directly from their treasuries. Mr. Bopp argued that this restriction was unduly burdensome.The significance of the eventual ruling in this case, Federal Election Commission v. Wisconsin Right to Life Inc., No. 06-969, may depend on what standard the court sets for distinguishing genuine issue ads from the “electioneering communications” that the law seeks to regulate.The district court’s decision said that judges should restrict themselves to examining the “four corners” of the ad itself: if its language does not exhort viewers to take action, it passes the test and must be permitted even if the message, seen in a broader context, is perfectly clear.Mr. Bopp said this restriction was essential so that an ad’s validity would be “reasonably ascertainable” in advance and not depend “upon the varied understandings of the listener.” The only test is, “What do the words say?” he said.The law’s supporters argue that many “sham” issue ads will escape regulation unless courts can evaluate them in the context in which voters will understand them. “The question is, What do the words mean?” Justice Souter told Mr. Bopp, adding, “It is impossible to know what the words mean without knowing the context in which they are spoken.”'"

"'07-04-27,'1','TOKYO, Friday, April 27 (Reuters) — Consumer prices in Japan declined more than expected in March while industrial output showed a surprise fall, raising the hurdle for the central bank to raise interest rates.A separate report Friday showed the nation’s jobless rate was steady at an 8 ½-year low and household spending rose slightly, supporting views that Japan’s economy remains solid.The core consumer price index, which excludes fresh food prices, fell 0.3 percent in March from a year earlier, against economists’ consensus forecast for a 0.2 percent drop. It was the second consecutive month of decline.Many companies in Japan’s service sector tend to revise prices at the start of their business year in April, so that figures in the Tokyo area were also considered.The core consumer price index in the Tokyo area, announced a month ahead of the nationwide figures, was flat in April from a year earlier, matching a consensus forecast.Industrial production, which had been stagnating, fell 0.6 percent in March from a month earlier, below a median market forecast for a 1.1 percent rise.

"'07-04-27,'1','Coca-Cola Enterprises reported a 6 percent decline in earnings yesterday but beat Wall Street estimates, helped by the introduction of Coke Zero in Europe and raw material costs that rose less than expected.Shares in the company, the largest bottler of Coca-Cola drinks, closed up 13 cents, at $22.40, on the New York Stock Exchange.Coke Zero, a new cola drink with no calories, raised sales in Europe. This helped offset weaker sales in North America, where changing tastes favor noncarbonated drinks.The costs of aluminum, used in cans, and high-fructose corn syrup, used as a sweetener, continued to climb but not as much as analysts expected.Net profit fell to $15 million, or 3 cents a share, from $16 million, or 3 cents a share, a year ago. Excluding items like revamping costs, profit was even at 9 cents a share, handily beating analysts’ average forecast of 5 cents, according to Reuters estimates.The company, based in Atlanta, affirmed its 2007 forecast and said it expected “significant business headwinds” for the rest of the year.Coca-Cola Enterprises, which is about 35 percent owned by the Coca-Cola Company, said price increases helped revenue rise 5.4 percent, to $4.57 billion, ahead of the average forecast of $4.54 billion.'"
"'07-04-27,'1','Microsoft’s online services business remained a problem. Revenue in that division rose 11 percent, to $623 million, and losses rose sharply, to $200 million.Yet the quarterly results point to the underlying strength and profitability of the main engines of the company’s business — Windows desktop operating systems, Office productivity programs and, increasingly, Microsoft’s server software, used in corporate data centers.“The core business is doing very well,” said Charles DiBona, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Company.Revenue for the quarter was $14.40 billion, an increase of 32 percent from the year-earlier quarter. Quarterly sales were about $500 million higher than the Wall Street consensus, compiled by Thomson Financial.Net profit was $4.93 billion, or 65 percent higher than a year ago. Earnings were 50 cents a share. Excluding a 2 cent gain from tax benefits and 1 cent charge for legal expenses, the earnings were 49 cents a share. That was 3 cents a share higher than analysts’ estimates.Revenue and profits in the quarter were inflated, as expected, by coupon programs Microsoft introduced last year when Windows Vista and Office 2007 were delayed and missed the year-end holiday season in the consumer market. The new products did not ship until the end of January.To encourage holiday sales of personal computers, Microsoft offered free or low-cost upgrades to the delayed software. So in the December quarter, the company deferred $1.67 billion of revenue. That revenue, and $1.14 billion in net profits, spilled over into the quarter ended in March, Microsoft’s third fiscal quarter.Still, Microsoft’s quarterly revenue would have increased 17 percent even without that one-time lift, and the Windows PC business would have been 30 percent higher than the year-earlier quarter.“There was a lot of concern about Vista, but this shows it is off to a good start, even with the ill-timed launch,” said Andy Miedler, an analyst at Edward Jones.In an interview, Christopher P. Liddell, Microsoft’s chief financial officer, said the sales of Windows Vista were $300 million to $400 million higher than the company’s internal projections, and Office 2007 sales were about $200 million higher.In the online services business, where Microsoft trails its main rivals, Google and Yahoo, Mr. Liddell pointed to a 23 percent increase in ad revenue as “encouraging progress.” The continuing losses, he added, are regarded as investments as Microsoft tries to build that business. “We’re in investment mode, and that’s going to be our strategy for the foreseeable future,” Mr. Liddell said.And it is a big-spending financial arms race for the major companies. According to Ms. Friar of Goldman Sachs, Microsoft is expected to spend an estimated $4 billion in 2007 on online services business, excluding capital expenditures, like equipping data centers. Yahoo, Goldman estimates, plans to spend $4.7 billion, and Google, $8 billion.Sales of Microsoft’s server software — databases, e-mail systems and other products used in corporate computer centers — rose 15 percent, to $2.75 billion, and the unit’s operating income rose 32 percent, to $979 million.Sales for the entertainment and devices unit, which includes Xbox video game consoles, slipped 22 percent, to $929 million.A year ago, the new Xbox line had just been introduced. The losses in that business, at $315 million, were $87 million narrower in the year-earlier quarter. Microsoft has set fiscal 2008 as the goal for when that business should break even and turn profitable.'"
"'07-04-27,'1','Nevertheless, Jayson Myers, the chief economist for Canadian Manufacturers and Exporters, an Ottawa-based trade group, said that many companies would struggle with the plan, particularly during the first three years.“It is going to be very difficult for companies to meet these targets,” Mr. Myers said, adding that paperwork associated with the program will add to corporate costs.But several environmental groups said that because the 18 percent reduction is tied to units of production, not overall output, total greenhouse emissions in Canada may continue to rise.Stephen Hazell, executive director of the Sierra Club of Canada, said that Alberta’s oil sands projects, which are an increasingly important energy source for the United States, would probably increase production by twice the rate they are required to curb per-unit gas emissions during the three-year period.“The use reductions based on emission intensity is deceptive,” Mr. Hazell said. “In the oil sands, we may see overall emissions still increasing by 4 to 6 percent a year.”Pierre R. Alvarez, the president of the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers, however, rejected suggestions that his industry would not make a significant contribution or face significant costs.“This is the toughest target the oil and gas industry will face in the world, at least in the short term,” Mr. Alvarez said.The government’s plan for the auto industry is less clear. Mr. Baird said that Canada would work with the United States to develop a continental fuel efficiency standard that could become effective in 2011.Basel E. Hargrove, the president of the Canadian Auto Workers Union, said he was relieved that the government did not attempt to establish a special standard for Canada. Because most automobiles made in Canada are exported to the United States, Mr. Hargrove said that special Canadian rules might have prompted manufacturers to curb Canadian production.Over all, Mr. Baird estimated that meeting the targets would cost the Canadian economy about 7 billion to 8 billion Canadian dollars a year, an amount that Mr. Myers said may be understated.Despite that expense, if the plan works as forecast environmental groups said that Canada would be 8 to 13 years late in meeting its Kyoto commitments.Mr. Baird, however, said that those targets, which were agreed to by a previous Liberal government, were unrealistic.'"
"'07-04-27,'1','EMI Group, the struggling British music giant, has hired the longtime industry executive Roger Ames, a former chairman of Warner Music Group, to revive its North American operation.The appointment of Mr. Ames, a 57-year-old native of Trinidad, comes more than three months after a management shakeup in which EMI ousted the two senior executives overseeing its recorded music operation. Mr. Ames had been a consultant advising EMI on a range of issues for the last two years.Mr. Ames will oversee the company’s labels in the United States, including the Capitol Music Group and Blue Note Records, but he is almost sure to play some role in determining EMI’s strategies for future deal making. As head of Warner Music in 2000 — when it was a unit of Time Warner — Mr. Ames tried to orchestrate a merger with EMI, but the deal collapsed amid doubts that it would receive regulatory approval.After Time Warner sold the music unit to an investor consortium led by Edgar Bronfman Jr. in 2003, Mr. Ames found himself in a diminished role, and soon left the company. Warner and EMI have talked on and off about merger or acquisition deals ever since. Most recently, talks between the two sides have been hung up on regulatory concerns.EMI’s chief, Eric Nicoli, took direct control of the company’s music operation in a reorganization earlier this year and remains in that role. But the hiring of Mr. Ames puts an experienced record industry executive in charge of the company’s labels in the world’s biggest music market.As part of the new arrangement, Ivan Gavin, EMI’s chief operating officer for North America, is leaving the company.'"
"'07-04-27,'1','WASHINGTON, April 26 — The potential risk to humans who might have eaten meat contaminated with melamine is extremely low, and the Food and Drug Administration believes that only 6,000 hogs may have eaten the reconstituted feed.But concern has shifted to encompass melamine-related compounds that include cyanuric acid, which can be used as a pool cleaner, and mixed with melamine could cause crystal formations that damage kidneys and could in some cases cause the organ to fail, an F.D.A. official said.Melamine, a compound used to make plastic utensils and as a fertilizer in some countries, has been found in wheat gluten and rice protein concentrate that came from two Chinese suppliers starting as far back as July 2006.On Thursday, a new recall was issued for food containing rice protein concentrate, said David Elder, the director of enforcement in the Office of Regulatory Affairs at the F.D.A. More than 100 pet foods have been recalled since March.The majority of the 6,000 hogs thought to have eaten the contaminated product are still on the farms where they were raised, but the Department of Agriculture is still tracking down products from 345 hogs: 50 from a custom slaughterhouse in California that cannot be sold in retail, 195 from a farm in Kansas that were sent to a facility in Nebraska, and no more than 100 hogs from the processing plant in Utah, said Nicol Andrews, a spokeswoman for the department. It is not known if any of these hogs were eaten, she said.Pork producers in California, New York, North Carolina, South Carolina and Utah are being investigated, and Oklahoma has been added to the list. It has been determined that the feed sent to Ohio predated the tainted food, and that state has been taken off the list. Swine that ate the adulterated product will be euthanized and farmers compensated for the animals. A feed mill in Missouri is still being investigated, Ms. Andrews said.'"
"'07-04-27,'1','Among non-Western fields, he embraced Japanese pottery and Chinese ceramics, but his outstanding contribution was to the appreciation and study of African art. His interest in that field was born early and indirectly. In 1948, as a member of MoMA’s Young Collectors Club, he was asked by the museum’s director, Rene d’Harnoncourt, to bid on the museum’s behalf for several African pieces coming up for auction in Stuttgart, Germany.Mr. Bareiss’s bids were successful, and his fascination with African art was settled. He later recalled being struck at the time by how little scholarly and critical attention had been given to the area, apart from noting its influence on artists like Picasso and Brancusi.For him, African art became increasingly meaningful on its own terms, as an aesthetic of the highest accomplishment and complexity.“In my view it has had (and may indeed still have) a far greater influence on people than the philosophies and religions of Western Europe and the Near East or the Orient,” he wrote in 1997 in the catalog for “Kilengi: African Art from the Bareiss Family Collection,” a traveling exhibition of the African objects he had acquired with his wife, Molly Stimson Bareiss, his longtime partner in collecting.He shaped their African collection of more than 800 objects in distinctive ways. Although its major concentration is work from Central Africa, particularly the Democratic Republic of Congo, it also makes significant forays into southeastern Africa, including Angola, Mozambique, Tanzania and Rwanda, largely ignored until that time by other collectors and museums.Mr. Bareiss’s embracing and exploratory worldview was in part a product of his international background. Born in Tübingen, Germany, in 1919, he came to the United States in 1937. Starting in the 1970s, he lived more than half the year in Munich, where he ran his family’s textile manufacturing business until it was sold in 1984. In Munich, he joined other collectors in founding the Galerie Verein, which was instrumental in building a collection of contemporary German art that is now in the Neue Pinakothek.He had many strong institutional ties in the United States. In addition to serving as a trustee at MoMA from 1964 to 1973, he shared the role of interim director in 1969 and 1970 with Wilder Green and Richard H. Koch. From 1972 to 1990 he was a member of MoMA’s drawings committee, and from 1972 to 2003 he was on the committee of prints and drawings.He graduated with a bachelor’s degree in business science from Yale University in 1940. He was on the governing board of the Yale Art Gallery for half a century and served as its chairman from 1987 to 1995. He also made substantial gifts of art to the museum and endowed a curatorship in ancient art.At its height the Walter and Molly Bareiss Collection consisted of more than 9,000 works, many of which have been exhibited internationally and acquired by museums.His wife died last year. Besides his son Hugh, of Stamford, Mr. Bareiss is survived by three other sons: Henry, of Rochester Hills, Minn; Conrad, of Stamford; and Philip, of Taos, N.M. A daughter, Charlotte Bareiss Knox of Boston, and 11 grandchildren also survive him.The couple’s African collection is on view as a long-term loan to the Birmingham Art Museum in Alabama. The “Kilengi” show, organized by Christopher D. Roy at the University of Iowa in 1997, traveled in Germany before arriving in Iowa and then the Neuberger Museum of Art in Purchase, N.Y.Important pieces from the couple’s overall collection are to be included next month in auctions of African and Oceanic art at Sotheby’s in New York.'"

It chronicled the life of the mother, the noted British author and feminist Mary Wollstonecraft (1759-97), who died a few days after the birth of her daughter, the future Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley.Her second biography, “Mary Shelley: Romance and Reality” (Little, Brown, 1989), was the story of the daughter (1797-1851) who wrote “Frankenstein” and was the wife of the poet Percy Bysshe Shelley.Reviewing the Mary Shelley biography in The New York Times Book Review, Carolyn Heilbrun wrote: “Ms. Sunstein has corrected the erroneous assumptions that have misled so many critics, myself (when young) included.” She added: “Ms. Sunstein is to be praised for looking anew at so misunderstood a life.”In 1989 Ms. Sunstein’s Mary Shelley biography was awarded the Modern Language Association Prize for Independent Scholars.'"
"'07-04-27,'1','TOKYO, April 26 (Reuters) — Nissan Motor posted its first annual profit decline under the chief executive Carlos Ghosn on Thursday and postponed its midterm targets by a year after sales collapsed in the United States and Japan.Nissan was overtaken last year by Honda Motor as Japan’s second-biggest automaker, behind Toyota, as a weaker brand image and a dearth of new models took their toll.Mr. Ghosn has built a reputation as a turnaround king through his commitment to business goals, winning plaudits for transforming a near-bankrupt Nissan into one of the sector’s most profitable carmakers in a matter of years.But with goals delayed and profits in reverse, Mr. Ghosn, who also heads Nissan’s French partner, Renault, is under pressure to show he can steer the company to sustainable and steady growth.“This past year, we hit a bump in the road,” Mr. Ghosn said at a news conference. “We’ve had an early wake-up call.”'"
"'07-04-27,'1','NAIROBI, Kenya, April 26 — Ali Mohammed Gedi, Somalia’s transitional prime minister, declared a turning point on Thursday in his battle with insurgents after a month of heavy combat that has killed more than 1,000 civilians.“We have won,” he said at a news conference in Mogadishu, Somalia’s shell-shocked capital.As he spoke, Ethiopian-led forces aligned with the Somali government pushed deep into insurgent territory, much of which has been reduced to smoldering rubble. More than 100 gunmen came out with their hands up and surrendered to government troops, Mr. Gedi said.“Soon, Mogadishu will be under our control,” he said.How soon, though, remains an open question. Witnesses said that loud gun battles resumed Thursday night in southern Mogadishu as insurgents, to cover their retreat, fired rocket-propelled grenades even after Mr. Gedi’s declaration. Many neighborhoods remained deadly no-go zones, and many residents seemed decidedly more pessimistic than Mr. Gedi.“These guys will just go underground — again,” said Hassan Mohammed Isse, a banana seller in Mogadishu, referring to the insurgents.If the heavy fighting lets up, it will follow the pattern of this conflict since it started in December. Somalia’s militias are no match, in toe-to-toe combat, for the better trained and much better equipped Ethiopian Army. The Ethiopians demonstrated that decisively in early battles when Somali militias tried frontal assaults against Ethiopian troops, who then cut them down by the truckload.'"
"'07-04-27,'1','The Guggenheim show may end this era’s obscurity, but it also helps explain it. Organized by Vivien Greene, the museum’s associate curator and a scholar of Divisionism, the show pits the Italians against Seurat and his French, Dutch and Belgian followers. It shows that the Italians were stylistically all over the place, pushing Pointillism toward realism, classicism, Symbolism, class consciousness and even Impressionism. They borrowed riffs from the Pre-Raphaelites, Puvis de Chavannes and Ferdinand Hodler, and they modified their styles when government suppression threatened. All this in an exhibition of only 37 paintings, 16 of which are by non-Italians.Ultimately this selection is long on history and short on truly convincing art. But the material is so fresh and there is so much going on in terms of history, politics and painting that it almost doesn’t matter. The show opens a new window on the spread of Modernism outside France. If many of the works are period pieces, they are also immensely appealing, big-hearted and physically robust.Ms. Greene has divided the show into sections on light, rural life, social problems, landscape and Symbolism that flow together almost seamlessly, despite the striking shifts in subject matter and style. For the Italians Seurat’s innovation was less fixed style than a new consciousness of paint as substance. It inspired them to use it physically in ways that ranged far and sometimes wide of dots.Segantini, the first Italian to take up Divisionism, evolved a narrow, threadlike stroke that became known as the “Segantini stitch.” He applied its dense tweediness to an essentially realist armature, maintaining a stylistic consistency that stands out here. Usually his colors are fairly undivided if not monochromatic, as in a large, chocolaty, wonderfully tactile portrait of Carlo Rotta, a Milanese soap magnate, sitting at his desk in the russet glow of a lamp. The all-over density continues in “Return From the Woods” (1890), which shows a woman pulling a sled through snow toward a village; its austerity of form is broken only by a cargo of tangled branches worthy of Lucian Freud. “Spring Pasture” (1896) has a similar if grainier force, thanks to the tiny threads of paint that slalom across snowy peak, granite and Alpine grass.In contrast Longoni presents a different personality and style each time out. His “Orator of the Strike” (1890-1), which caused a furor at the Brera Triennale, shows a laborer clinging to scaffolding, raising his fist and shouting to a sea of upturned faces. It is a rarity: a near riot rendered in the juicy staccato of Impressionism. “Reflections of a Starving Man” (1894) in which a pauper gazes through a restaurant window at a sleek couple dining inside, is smoothly illustrational, though it caused Longoni to be threatened with charges of inciting class hatred. By 1903 he had retreated into the Symbolist reveries of “The Sound of the Stream,” with its violin-playing muse and immense shelf of water. But in 1905, he bounced back with the powerful “Glacier,” an implacable shelf of ice and rock. Its thick ribbons of paint turn the Segantini stitch into nubby weave that even an Abstract Expressionist might admire.Clearly traditional perspective tended to take precedent over the flattened protomodern serenity of Seurat. Angelo Morbelli used photographs to achieve the deep space of “For 80 Cents!,” which shows a row of women engaged in the back-breaking work of weeding rice paddies, while dicing the colors and brush strokes so finely they take on a conservative sheen. Morbelli keeps the space deep but roughens the surface in a far more imposing painting of a few white-haired old men dozing among the empty benches of a refractory in an old-age home; they have outlived their usefulness and their comrades.Photography also figured in Pellizza’s vaguely Pre-Raphaelite “Procession,” as well as “The Fourth Estate,” which is represented here by a lush early study (the leaders minus the crowd) from 1892. (Pellizza’s process is detailed in a touching display of letters, photographs and sketches at the Italian Cultural Institute at 686 Park Avenue.) Related Symbolist works include the large, saccharin paintings of Gaetano Previati, which are ripe with swooning Greek-gowned maidens, swirling forms and unearthly light, or the small, dark, far more engaging landscapes of Grubicy, who admired Whistler but might have also taken cues from Louis Comfort Tiffany. Here Divisionism all but disappears in a hard gloss that gives Grubicy’s bodies of water the iridescence of mother of pearl or Favrile glass.The non-Italian artists were hardly without political impulses, as works by Camille Pissarro, Paul Signac, Henri-Edmond Cross and Maximilien Luce attest. But they stuck closer to orthodox Pointillism, with sometimes odd results. The tapestrylike evenness of Cross’s luminous, mostly pastel “Grape Harvest” suggests a serene, idyllic Arcadia, despite the sun-baked women crouching in the field. And in “After the Strike,” by the Dutch artist Jan Toorop, the anguish of a family carrying their injured son is both apparent and slightly comical. A better balance of Pointillism and politics occurs in Pellizza’s “Drowned Man,” in which a body on a stretcher is carried along a stony beach bathed in light. But for Pointillism at its best, you must still turn to Seurat, the measles’ source, and especially to a purplish coastal scene with undulating clouds. His dots percolate at liberty like nothing else in this fascinating show.'"
"'07-04-27,'1','“We can’t be sure of avoiding dangerous climate interference, but it’s true we can identify a lot that can be done now, and over the next few decades, to increase the chances a lot,” said Michael Grubb, an author of the report and chief economist for the Carbon Trust, an organization financed by the British government to help promote cuts in greenhouse gas emissions.Copies of the report’s 24-page summary for policy makers have been filtering out to environmental groups, one of which provided a copy to The New York Times.Developing countries, where an unparalleled burst of industrialization and construction is under way, offer some of the biggest opportunities for avoiding climate-warming emissions, the draft said, particularly in choices of power plants and building designs.It said that changes in design standards and materials chosen for construction could trim about 30 percent of projected emissions of heat-trapping gases from buildings by 2020, with more than half of the cuts coming in developing countries. The improvements in buildings could come with a net savings to the economy from lower energy costs, it said.The report is part of the fourth assessment since 1990 of global warming by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, created nearly 20 years ago to assess evidence that human activities were affecting climate and to review policy options.In its latest climate review, released in February, the panel concluded with near certainty that smokestack and tailpipe emissions of carbon dioxide and other gases were the dominant cause of recent warming. A second report, released this month, said that ecosystems and climate patterns were already shifting as a result of the warming trend and that substantial risks to people, wildlife and coasts lay ahead.The new report will probably be contentious when it is reviewed in Bangkok by officials from more than 100 countries. Governments have the right to seek some changes.Clashes are likely, in part because this report touches most deeply both on domestic debates over climate, like the tussle in the United States over the need for a bill restricting gas emissions, and the fate of international climate agreements, particularly the Kyoto Protocol.'"
"'07-04-27,'1','But it was a good thing, because we were all sad about losing Nicky and thrilled with this new puppy. Here was this happy bundle of energy, kissing and licking us and romping around. We named him Wolfie.I took to him immediately. He became my best friend who never moped around, was always glad to see me, never hassled me about homework. We really bonded.They grow so quickly! In a year this tiny, fluffy puppy was an enormous, long-haired white shepherd. He knew each person in the family — my two older sisters, my mother’s two older sisters, my dad — and he had us all figured out. He loved all of us, but he made me feel special.As a child, I felt alone, and different, at least partly because I didn’t have a mother. Wolfie was my friend. He was the one who was with me the most, and all that other stuff didn’t matter to him. He just loved me. He was there for me for whatever I needed.Walking down the street with Wolfie was an experience. He looked like an animal from a fantasy. With his big white body and his enormous head, you could imagine he was a unicorn. When I walked him, cars would stop and people would roll down their windows and stare at us. Here was this thin, sad little boy with this longhaired, white creature. Wolfie knew they were watching, and he was proud. He carried his head high. He had great elegance.He was so attached to me that he wouldn’t let anybody get near me. He’d bark and even bite people. It was a real problem. I didn’t have too many friends anyway, but one day, somebody from the neighborhood came a little too close to me as I was walking home from school, so Wolfie bit him. It was a horrible scene. Wolfie and I ran home, and later, after my father got home, the police came.My father brought the policeman into the living room, where Wolfie and I were lying on the floor in front of the television. I had my arms around him, and he was just lying there, looking peaceful.“Look at that dog,” my father said. “He can’t possibly be the dog you got the complaint about. He’s not at all aggressive.”“We should still take him in,” the policeman said. “He could be a danger in the neighborhood.”I was lying there, just holding on to Wolfie.I didn’t know what I’d do if the police took him away. My father talked to the policeman and showed him how gentle Wolfie was, and eventually convinced him not to take Wolfie.It was interesting that he had these aggressive qualities toward strangers but he was absolutely gentle with me. I could play lion tamer and put my head in his mouth, and he would just wait. He would never think of harming me.We had a housekeeper named Beulah Baker who had come from down South, where she had been a pickle picker on a pickle farm. She never did do much housework, but she was wonderful. She sounded a little like Butterfly McQueen. She was very darling and so affectionate to me. We spent so much time in the house together, just Beulah Baker, Wolfie and me. Beulah used to teach me how to set her wigs, and I was pretty good at it.On a typical afternoon, Wolfie would be lying there on the floor, and Beulah Baker and I would be busy with combs and pins, working on one of her wigs.Later we would watch television. I loved old movies — I still do — and I just absorbed the tragic heroines. I tend to watch the same ones that I loved as a child over and over: “Marie Antoinette,” with Norma Shearer; “Waterloo Bridge,” with Vivien Leigh; “I Could Go On Singing,” with Judy Garland; “The Hard Way,” with Ida Lupino; “Random Harvest,” with Greer Garson; “I’m No Angel,” with Mae West; and a zillion others.Then, my favorite part of the day, my turn to perform. I would mimic back for Beulah and Wolfie these larger-than-life romantic actresses in their classic roles. The afternoon would end with Beulah sitting on the sofa with this huge white German Shepherd at her feet. And I’d be singing Judy Garland songs to her.Wolfie would sit there staring at me, very alert. He made it seem like watching this skinny little boy singing “The Man That Got Away” was something a dog was really meant to do. That was a typical afternoon in our house.You can see why not much housework got done. When I was 7, as a special treat, my father took me to the old Metropolitan Opera House to see Joan Sutherland in “La Sonnambula.” I was amazed — it’s the story of a young girl who goes walking in her sleep, and sitting there in the audience, I was watching this magnificent redheaded lady drifting through a glorious 19th-century painted landscape. When I got up in front of Wolfie and Beulah, I was trying to recreate that for them, the beauty and the dreamy quality. In a way, you could say that my entire career has been an attempt to recreate that first impression.Wolfie came into my life at a time when I was completely vulnerable. And that made me bond so intensely with him. He was enormous, he was mystical, he was white. He was the constant, strong, loving, lovable dog that took care of me. It was like he came from an enchanted land. He made me feel that I belonged to somebody.'"

"'07-04-28,'0','But while the United States and its European allies want to implement the plan as soon as possible, Russia has sought to start new negotiations between the Serbs and ethnic Albanians and has implied it might veto Mr. Ahtisaari’s plan. The Security Council has not yet indicated if it is ready to put the plan to a vote.Under Mr. Ahtisaari’s plan, Kosovo is to be granted independence, but with international oversight of a European-led mission that would look out for the interests of the ethnic Serbs.The province is internationally recognized as part of Serbia, but has been run by the United Nations since June 1999. Serbia was forced to cede its authority over the province by a 78-day NATO-led bombing campaign after Serbian-dominated Yugoslav security forces were accused of committing widespread atrocities against ethnic Albanians.Over the past year, Mr. Ahtisaari conducted negotiations on Kosovo’s future between ethnic Albanians and Serb leaders, but the talks in Vienna faltered in February. The ethnic Albanians want independence, but Serbia and Kosovo’s ethnic Serbs are against that.As a result, Mr. Ahtisaari concluded that only an imposed solution resolving Kosovo’s status could work, and submitted his plan to the Security Council.Russia, an ally of Serbia, requested this week’s fact-finding mission, suggesting that the council had not been fully apprised of the reality in Kosovo.Mr. Verbeke’s statement appeared to suggest that at least some member states were not ready to agree to an imminent vote.United Nations officials present at some of the ambassadors’ meetings with local politicians said that the South African representative, Dumisani S. Kumalo, had openly voiced reservations about the speed with which the United Nations was considering implementing Mr. Ahtisaari’s proposal, and said that no alternatives appeared to have been discussed. Mr. Kumalo was unavailable for comment.In the past week, Russian criticism of Mr. Ahtisaari’s plan has grown, with its deputy foreign minister, Vladimir Titov, warning it would “not get through the Security Council.” As one of the five permanent members of the Council, Russia has the right to veto any resolution.On Friday, Vitaly Cherkin, the Russian ambassador to the United Nations, suggested that Serbia’s proposal — in which Kosovo would be granted autonomy with some powers returning to authorities in Belgrade — should be looked at as the basis for new negotiations between the two sides.“Since no other theme except Kosovo’s status was discussed at the talks with Ahtisaari, it would probably make sense to study Belgrade’s initiative,” Mr. Cherkin, who was on the fact-finding mission, told the Itar Tass news agency.But in an interview Friday, Zalmay Khalilzad, the new United States ambassador to the United Nations, said he remained optimistic that the Russians could work with Mr. Ahtisaari’s plan.“We hope to reach an understanding with Russia,” said Mr. Khalilzad, who was also on the United Nations trip.And on Saturday, Daniel Fried, an assistant secretary of state, took a harder tone.“We hope that Russia understands that Kosovo is going to be independent one way or another,” Mr. Fried said at a forum in Brussels on trans-Atlantic relations, Reuters reported. “It will either be done in a controlled, supervised way that provides for the well-being of the Serbian people, or it will take place in an uncontrolled way, and the Kosovo Serbs will suffer the most, which would be terrible.”Kosovo’s ethnic Albanians and Serbs used the visit by the United Nations group to deliver impassioned defenses of their views, as the ambassadors were brought on a tour of sites marked by a decade of turbulence. (The locations themselves were a matter of intense negotiation between Russia and the United States, according to American and United Nations officials, with each site seen as favorable to either Serbs or Albanians.)On Friday afternoon, delegates were able to walk through the divided city of Mitrovica, from the Albanian-dominated South, to the Serb-dominated North, across the city’s main bridge. A roadside banner on the ethnic Serbian side, written in English, read: “In the name of God and justice, do not give our Holy Land as a present to the Albanians.”In Svinjare, a Serb village a mile to the south of Mitrovica, the ambassadors were shown houses that had been burned down by ethnic Albanians during riots in March 2004, in which more than 4,000 people were forced to flee their homes. Kosovo’s Albanian-dominated government has since rebuilt the village, but only one man has returned to live there.On Saturday, the ambassadors were driven to Krushe e Vogel, an ethnic Albanian village where 113 men and boys were shot and then burned by their Serbian neighbors and paramilitary forces on March 26, 1999.'"

"'07-04-28,'0','“In recent days, the problem during the presidential election has focused on secularism discussions,” the statement read. “This situation has been anxiously followed by the Turkish Armed Forces. The Turkish armed forces maintains its firm determination to carry out its clearly specified duties to protect these principles and has absolute loyalty and belief in this determination.”The one-and-a-half-page statement went on to list what it called recent violations against secularism: a Koran class held on National Day, school principals ordered to celebrate the Prophet Muhammad’s birthday and preaching organized in a public school.“The fact that a large portion of such activities was conducted with the consent and approval of local government offices intensifies the gravity of the issue,” the statement said.It was not clear on Friday night whether the military was prepared to oust Mr. Erdogan’s government if he continued to push Mr. Gul’s candidacy, but the warning was the sharpest it has made in recent years, and raised questions about whether Mr. Erdogan had stretched the limits of the secular state too far.The military issued a similar warning to the government of the Islamist politician Necmettin Erbakan shortly before he was forced from power in 1997; he remains under house arrest.“They will create for the first time in Turkey a very dangerous situation and upset all the balances,” said Onur Oymen, a leader in the main secular opposition party, of the prospect of Mr. Erdogan’s party controlling the presidency, prime minister’s office and Parliament. “In a country with a Muslim population, you can’t have democracy without secularism.”But in the paradox of modern Turkey, it has been political leaders like Mr. Gul and Mr. Erdogan, both important thinkers in Turkey’s political Islam movements of the 1990s, who have proved most adept at modernizing the state.Mr. Gul, the country’s foreign minister, has lobbied tirelessly for Turkey’s membership in the European Union. In the party’s four years in power, the Turkish economy has experienced unprecedented growth.“This government has been in power for four years and they have done nothing to put Islam in politics,” said Metin Heper, a political science professor at Bilkent University in Ankara.European and American diplomats, initially skeptical of the party, now have signaled no objection to Mr. Erdogan and his allies.Mr. Gul’s chances of being confirmed as president appear strong if the constitutional court does not intervene or if Mr. Erdogan does not withdraw him from consideration because of the military’s threats. Mr. Gul faces another round of voting next week. If a third round is required, a simple majority endorsement by Parliament would be all he needs — nearly assured, given that his party controls 353 of 554 seats.Before the vote on Friday morning in the elegant stone Parliament building here, Mr. Gul’s party was trying hard to win over the opposition. Small pots of rice pudding, Ataturk Forest Farm ice cream and more than 100 pounds of Turkish delight were handed out. The treats circulated, but the two camps remained separate: nearly half of the inner chamber’s seats were empty, their secular occupants in a back room smoking, sipping tea and watching the proceedings on a flat-screen television.Turkish society has changed dramatically in the 80 years since the state was founded, and in many ways the secular party leaders do not seem to have changed with it.Ali Bulac, a columnist for a conservative daily newspaper, Zaman, said that the secular elite “are losing their status, their advantages. So naturally they will react.”While much of Turkey’s secular elite exaggerates the threat of Islamism to suit their political needs, some secular Turks have strong arguments for fearing a future in which the devout rank-and-file of Mr. Erdogan’s party enter midlevel government jobs.Guldal Okutucu, the head of the women’s branch of the main opposition party, said she had documented instances of local officials separating men from women in hotels and hospitals and at beaches.“In every place that has life,” she said, smoking a cigarette in the opposition’s back room, “we’re trying to take action because tomorrow it might be too late.”'"
"'07-04-28,'0','Neither occurred in the open fashion it should have, she said.As questions began to mount about the sales, Ms. Kravis asked Mr. Black to be a little more humble, in his public and private dealings, she testified, and in return, Mr. Black sent her an e-mail message in 2003, before the criminal investigation was revealed, assuring her that he, Mr. Radler and others were doing business both legally and in the interest of the company’s stockholders.Ms. Kravis’s testimony came a day after another audit committee member, Richard Burt, testified that he had been misled by company officials about management’s dealings at Hollinger.Mr. Black and his top lieutenants are accused in the case, which is being tried in Federal District Court in Chicago, of pocketing more $60 million in noncompete payments beginning in the mid-1990s.The government has said and Ms. Kravis echoed the charge Friday, that the money should have belonged to shareholders of the company.Ms. Kravis, who studied economics in Ottawa, served on Canada’s largest bank, and did economic research for, among others, the Hudson Institute, said: “I was not advised of the transactions.” The transactions, according to testimony, were approved by an executive committee consisting of Mr. Black and Mr. Radler and one other Hollinger director, Richard Perle.She said she did not know why the payments were made by a committee rather than the full board.When first told of the accusations, Ms. Kravis said she thought they were inadvertent oversights and applauded Mr. Black and other company officials for admitting mistakes.In opening their cross-examination against Ms. Kravis on Friday, defense lawyers exhibited memos and e-mail messages they say showed that she should have known the agreements were not only routine but were well documented in company paperwork.Although she testified that she must have seen some memos shown by the defense in evidence calling attention to noncompete clauses at the heart of the case, she could not explain why she had not alerted other board members or government officials.Ms. Kravis testified for about four hours, with the defense just beginning its cross-examination in her final 45 minutes on the stand.Testimony is expected to continue next week with the various defendants’ lawyers expected to question Ms. Kravis.The former Illinois governor, James R Thompson, who, along with Mr. Burt made up the Hollinger audit committee, is also scheduled to testify.Mr. Radler, the former president who has since agreed to prison time and restitution, could testify next week as well.'"
"'07-04-28,'0','After a funeral in Moscow on Sunday at the Cathedral of Christ the Savior, Mr. Rostropovich is to be buried at the Novodevichy Cemetery, where the remains of his teachers Dmitri Shostakovich and Sergei Prokofiev also lie. His friend Boris N. Yeltsin, Russia’s first elected president, was buried there on Wednesday.As a cellist, Mr. Rostropovich played a vast repertory that included works written for him by some of the 20th century’s greatest composers. Among them were Shostakovich’s Cello Concertos; Prokofiev’s Cello Concerto, Cello Sonata and Symphony-Concerto; and Britten’s Sonata, Cello Symphony and three Suites.Perhaps because his repertory was so broad, Mr. Rostropovich was able to make his cello sing in an extraordinary range of musical accents. In the big Romantic showpieces — the Dvorak, Schumann, Saint-Säens and Elgar concertos, for example — he dazzled listeners with both his richly personalized interpretations and a majestic warmth of tone. His graceful accounts of the Bach Suites for Unaccompanied Cello illuminated the works’ structural logic as well as their inner spirituality.He could be a firebrand in contemporary works, and he seemed to enjoy producing the unusual timbres that modernist composers often demanded. He played the premieres of solo works by William Walton, Georges Auric, Dmitri Kabalevsky and Nikolai Miaskovsky, as well as concertos by Alfred Schnittke, Arvo Pärt, Krzysztof Penderecki and Lukas Foss, among others.As a conductor, he was an individualist. He happily molded tempos, phrase shapes and instrumental balances to suit an interpretive vision that was distinctly his own. And if his work did not suit all tastes, it was widely agreed that the passion he brought to the podium yielded performances that were often as compelling as they were unconventional.He was at his most eloquent, and also his most freewheeling, in Russian music, particularly in the symphonies of Tchaikovsky, Prokofiev and Shostakovich.Tall, heavyset and bald except for a halo of white hair, Mr. Rostropovich was a commanding presence both on and off the stage. But he was also gregarious in an extroverted, Russian way. At the end of an orchestral performance, he often hopped off the podium and kissed and hugged every musician within reach.He had a mischievous sense of humor that cut through the sobriety of the concert atmosphere. He sometimes surprised his accompanists by pasting centerfolds from men’s magazines into the pages of their scores. At the San Francisco Symphony’s 70th-birthday tribute to Isaac Stern, he played “the Swan” movement from Saint-Säens’s “Carnival of the Animals” attired in white tights, a ballet tutu, a swanlike headdress and red lipstick.Mr. Rostropovich was the music director of the National Symphony Orchestra in Washington from 1977 to 1994 and afterward remained close to it as its conductor laureate. He also had strong relationships with several of the world’s great orchestras, including the London Symphony Orchestra, the Philadelphia Orchestra and the New York Philharmonic.Last year Mr. Rostropovich announced that he would stop playing the cello publicly, but his conducting schedule remained as vigorous as ever. It included commemorations of the Shostakovich centenary in New York, Washington, San Francisco, Moscow and Tokyo.In an interview in The New York Times last year, Mr. Rostropovich said of Shostakovich, “He was the most important man in my life, after my father.”He added: “Sometimes when I’m conducting, I see his face coming to me. Sometimes it’s not really a happy face — I conduct maybe a bit too slow. So I conduct faster, and the face disappears.”Mr. Rostropovich always said that one of the principal lures of the podium was that the orchestral repertory seemed so vast when compared with the cello repertory. But he did not confine himself to the classics. He commissioned regularly, and led the premieres of more than 50 works.Two pieces written for him during his National Symphony years — Stephen Albert’s “Riverrun” Symphony and Morton Gould’s “Stringmusic” — won Pulitzer Prizes. Leonard Bernstein, Jacob Druckman, Richard Wernick, Gunther Schuller and Ezra Laderman were among the other composers who wrote for him or whose works had their world premieres under his baton.Mr. Rostropovich, who was widely known by his diminutive, Slava (which means glory in Russian), was also an accomplished pianist. He was often the accompanist at recitals by his wife, the Russian soprano Galina Vishnevskaya, whom he married in 1955 and who survives him, as do two daughters, Olga and Elena.Mr. Rostropovich became famous beyond musical circles as a symbol of artistic conscience and his defiance of the Soviet regime.When Mr. Solzhenitsyn came under attack by Soviet authorities in the late 1960s, Mr. Rostropovich and Ms. Vishnevskaya allowed him to stay in their dacha at Zhukovka, outside Moscow. He was their guest for four years, and Mr. Rostropovich tried to intercede on his behalf, personally taking the manuscript of “August 1914” to the Ministry of Culture and arguing that there was nothing threatening to the Soviet system in it. His efforts were rebuffed.Mr. Rostropovich’s own troubles began in 1970 when, out of frustration with the suppression of writers, artists and musicians, he sent an open letter to Pravda, the state-run newspaper, which did not publish it. Western newspapers did.“Explain to me, please, why in our literature and art so often people absolutely incompetent in this field have the final word,” he asked in the letter. “Every man must have the right fearlessly to think independently and express his opinion about what he knows, what he has personally thought about and experienced, and not merely to express with slightly different variations the opinion which has been inculcated in him.”After the letter was published, Mr. Rostropovich and Ms. Vishnevskaya were unable to travel abroad and faced dwindling engagements at home.Occasionally, it would seem that the ban was lifted. In 1971, Mr. Rostropovich conducted and Ms. Vishnevskaya sang in Bolshoi Opera performances of Prokofiev’s “War and Peace” in Vienna, and Mr. Rostropovich was allowed to travel to the United States for concerts. But the next year, scheduled appearances in Austria and Britain were canceled without explanation.It was not until 1974 that they were allowed out of the country again. That year they were given two-year travel visas. In the West, Mr. Rostropovich told interviewers that he missed his homeland and longed to return but that he would not do so until artists were free to speak their minds.“I will not utter one single lie in order to return,” he said in 1977. “And once there, if I see new injustice, I will speak out four times more loudly than before.”The Soviet government’s response was to revoke his and Ms. Vishnevskaya’s citizenship in 1978. Thereafter they traveled on special Swiss documents.But they outlived the Soviet system. With President Mikhail S. Gorbachev’s program of increased openness, Mr. Rostropovich began to renew his contacts with his homeland. He met with Mr. Gorbachev and President Ronald Reagan at the White House in 1987. In November 1989, immediately after the fall of the Berlin Wall, he gave an impromptu concert there.Mr. Rostropovich’s Soviet citizenship was restored in January 1990. The next month, he took the National Symphony to Moscow and Leningrad (now St. Petersburg). The event was the subject of a television documentary, “Soldiers of Music: Rostropovich Returns to Russia,” released on video in 1992.In 1991, when Communist hard-liners tried to topple the more open regime, Mr. Rostropovich went to Moscow to stand beside President Yeltsin.Two years later, during the siege of the Russian White House, Mr. Rostropovich, who was touring Russia again with the National Symphony, gave a free concert in Red Square, attended by 100,000 people. Originally planned as a gesture to music lovers who were unable to attend the indoor concerts, the performance was transformed into a show of support for democratization.“Russians need to be reminded at times like this that they are a great people,” he told a Times reporter at the time. “Events disrupt things a little sometimes, but listening to this music is a reminder that there’s a great nation here.”His soloist, for his 1993 Russian tour, was Ignat Solzhenitsyn, a pianist and the son of Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn.Mstislav Leopoldovich Rostropovich was born in Baku, Azerbaijan, on March 27, 1927. His parents, Leopold Rostropovich and Sofiya Nikolaevna Fedotov, were both musicians, and his mother began teaching him the piano when he was 4. When he was 8, he went to Paris to study the cello with his father, who had been a student of Pablo Casals.In the mid-1930s, the family moved to Moscow, where young Mstislav entered the Gnesin Institute. He made his debut at 13, playing a Saint-Saëns Concerto in Slavyansk, Ukraine, and in 1943, when he was 16, he entered the Moscow Conservatory as a student of Semyon Kozolupov.He also studied composition with Shostakovich, and continued to do so even after the Soviet authorities condemned both Shostakovich and Prokofiev for “formalist perversions and antidemocratic tendencies.” He later studied composition privately with Prokofiev, and although Mr. Rostropovich’s compositions are not well known, they include two piano concertos, a string quartet and several solo piano works.By the late 1940s, he had won competitions in Moscow and, in his first trips outside the Soviet Union, in Prague and Budapest. He toured widely during the 1950s, and in 1956 — the year he was appointed to a professorship at the Moscow Conservatory — he made his American debut at Carnegie Hall with a recital program that included sonatas by Brahms, Shostakovich and Bach and as the soloist in the Prokofiev Concerto with the New York Philharmonic under Dimitri Mitropoulos.Mr. Rostropovich was fond of concerto marathons. In an eight-concert series with the London Symphony Orchestra in 1967, he played 30 works by 24 composers. In New York in 1987, celebrating his 60th birthday, he gave five concerts with three orchestras — the New York Philharmonic, the Boston Symphony and the National Symphony — playing 15 cello concertos and conducting a handful of symphonies, as well as Britten’s “War Requiem.” As a bonus, he performed Bach’s six Suites for Unaccompanied Cello.That year President Reagan awarded him the Presidential Medal of Freedom, this country’s highest civilian honor. It was one of many awards and honors Mr. Rostropovich received in his career.Mr. Rostropovich made his conducting debut in 1968, when he led a performance of Tchaikovsky’s “Eugene Onegin” at the Bolshoi. He made his British conducting debut with the New Philharmonia Orchestra in 1974. His first American conducting performances were with the National Symphony and the San Francisco Opera in 1975.“I never studied, but I had the best teachers,” he said of his new career in 1975. “I played with the best conductors of the world.”In 1977 Mr. Rostropovich accepted the directorship of the National Symphony Orchestra, succeeding Antal Dorati. For one of his first concerts, Leonard Bernstein wrote “Slava!,” a festive overture that captured the ebullience of Mr. Rostropovich’s style. And although critics complained at first that his repertory was unduly conservative, he threw himself into contemporary works, including many composed for him and his orchestra.During his tenure he made significant improvements in the orchestra’s sound and cohesiveness, partly by reseating the strings — he moved the violas to the outside and the cellists to the center, to create a richer blend — but by systematically upgrading the roster as well.He also brought the orchestra into the world spotlight, taking it on its first tours of Europe, Asia and the Soviet Union, conducting it regularly at Carnegie Hall, and making many recordings with it.The most frequent criticism of Mr. Rostropovich as a conductor was that he sometimes became so carried away with the music that he let the performance get out of his control. Mr. Rostropovich objected to this analysis.“When I go to a rehearsal,” he told The Times in 1985, “I have already a model in my mind for the sound of a piece, for the shape of the interpretation. Maybe I’m wrong, but if there are no special acoustical problems in the hall, I produce exactly what I want. If there is a choice, I would rather have ideas and some difficulties of technique than a perfect technique and no ideas.”For several years, Mr. Rostropovich was a director of the Britten summer festival at Aldeburgh, England, and for a few seasons beginning in 1983, he had his own festival nearby, in Snape.In addition to conducting, he continued to pursue an active recital and concerto career as a cellist. His instrument was the 1711 “Duport” Stradivarius, which he had fitted with a special bent tailpin, to make the angle at which he held the cello more comfortable.He also continued to make superb recordings of the great cello works. Yet it was not until 1991, when he was 63, that he decided to record all six of the Bach Suites, a set he considered the crowning glory of the instrument’s literature.It was a project over which he maintained complete control. He chose the site, the Basilique Sainte-Madeleine, in the Burgundian village of Vézelay, France, because he considered the church’s acoustics perfect and the simplicity of its architecture inspiring. He produced and edited the recordings himself and paid for the sessions so that if he were dissatisfied, he would be free to destroy the tapes.As it turned out, he was pleased with the results, which were released on CD and video in 1995.Mr. Rostropovich frequently presided over cello master classes, and in 1997 he began offering a regular series of such classes, as well as performances, in his hometown, Baku.In 2004 the house in Baku where his family lived from 1925 to 1931 was opened as the Leopold and Mstislav Rostropovich Home-Museum.'"
"'07-04-28,'0','In an indirect reference to Mr. Nifong, the report said the attorney general’s review of the case was the first time the accuser had been asked formally about inconsistencies in her account. Mr. Nifong has acknowledged that he never questioned the accuser about the details of the case. He had said he simply believed her, based on police reports and a nurse’s account, and wanted to put her before a jury.Mr. Nifong dropped rape charges against the three men — David F. Evans, Collin Finnerty and Reade W. Seligmann — but kept other sexual offense charges in December after the woman changed her account of the party, where she had been hired to dance as a stripper. After the state bar filed the ethics charges against Mr. Nifong, he turned over the case to the attorney general on Jan. 13.State prosecutors studied more than 7,000 documents and interviewed 47 people, including the accuser, a 28-year-old single mother of three, several times.“Her proposed testimony about critical events changed whenever it was demonstrated that what she was saying could not be accurate,” the report said. She claimed pictures had been altered, denied making statements attributed to her by the police and gave “the impression that she was improvising as the interviews progressed.”The report added, “While witnesses often have inconsistencies in details when recounting events over time, the volume of inconsistent statements and the fact that many of these were substantial and were in regard to significant events rendered the truthfulness of the accusing witness in serious doubt.”The report said the process by which the accuser identified the three men was of “questionable validity.” She was shown photos only of lacrosse team members.The report also pointed out a lack of DNA or other forensic evidence to support the charges.“No medical evidence confirmed her stories,” it said. A sexual-assault nurse examiner “based her opinion that the exam was consistent with what the accusing witness was reporting largely on the accusing witness’s demeanor and complaints of pain rather than on objective evidence.”The accuser would have been an unreliable witness because she was impaired on the night of the party, the report said. She drank two beers and at times was incoherent, it said.After months of piecemeal accounts, the report also offered the most complete narrative yet of what occurred overnight March 13 into the early hours of March 14, 2006, based on interviews with 19 men at the party, 25 photographs and 2 videos.The accuser and another stripper were paid $800 to dance for two hours but stopped after five minutes when one of the men made a sexual remark while holding a broomstick. The women retreated to the bathroom and then outside, the report said. Some players felt cheated.Two players, separately, took money out of a bag that had been left by one of the dancers — only to be told by two team co-captains, including Mr. Evans, to return the money.The women came back inside after some of the players apologized to them, but soon “went back into the bathroom alone together and refused to come out.” Mr. Seligmann and Mr. Finnerty left the party shortly after the dancing stopped, records showed. There was not enough time for even a brief attack, the attorney general wrote.According to the report, a video showed the woman later, outside the house, “talking incoherently, apparently to no one in particular,” before lying down and then being helped to the car.The report said the second dancer then made a racial and sexual comment about the young men, who responded with racial epithets. The second dancer declined to talk with the attorney general unless she received a subpoena; the attorney general did not subpoena her.It was much later, after 2 a.m., after the police took the accuser to a Durham center for mental health and substance abuse, when she first said, in response to a question, that she had been raped.'"
"'07-04-28,'0','Even before negotiations begin in earnest, both sides are staking out hard positions. The United States says Russia will have no veto over American missile defense bases in Central Europe. In response, Russia has said that the new offer has done nothing to alter its opposition, and that it is prepared to kick the legs out from under other arms control agreements to show its anger.To be sure, this missile defense drama is only in its opening scene. The two missile defense sites, expected to cost about $3.5 billion, are still years away.At some level, the debate over the missile defense system is not even about interceptors and radar installations. Their effectiveness is a matter of conjecture. It is about Russia’s perception of, and insecurity about, its role in West-facing Europe.Thus, Washington and Moscow are playing to the populations of Poland and the Czech Republic, whose Parliaments would have to approve the bases, and beyond, to a broader and quite ambivalent European public.If the United States hoped that the tough talk this week from Moscow would unify Europe to rally publicly behind its plans to install 10 missile interceptors in Poland and a tracking radar in the Czech Republic, it is likely to be disappointed.Behind closed doors, America’s European allies were indeed united in their negative reaction to the Russian threats during a meeting on Thursday in Oslo attended by Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, NATO foreign ministers and the Russian foreign minister, Sergey V. Lavrov, according to American and European officials who were present or were briefed on the session.The Europeans took umbrage at the Russians’ belligerence, after a conciliatory mission to Moscow by Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates in which he offered to share missile defense technology with Russia.“For the Russians to turn around and slap us, it did not go over well with European governments today. That’s for sure,” said a senior American official, who spoke on diplomatic ground rules of anonymity.“There was virtual unanimity that Russia should work with the Americans and work with NATO on missile defense, as several delegations said, especially after the Americans have clearly gone out of their way to make constructive proposals to the Russians,” the American official said.That version of events in Oslo, as presented by the senior American official, was confirmed by representatives of two European nations in attendance.Yet speaking publicly on Friday, European officials remained wary about the missile defense proposal, as they had been for months.“The core issue is to prevent a spiral of mistrust between Russia and the U.S.,” said the German foreign minister, Frank-Walter Steinmeier. “And this is what is in our immediate European interest.”Other German politicians repeated qualms that an American missile defense system might upset the strategic balance in Europe or ignite a new arms race between Russia and the West.Eckart von Klaeden, a foreign policy adviser to Chancellor Angela Merkel and a supporter of Washington, predicted that the threat by President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia to pull out of the treaty limiting conventional forces in Europe would not make Europe fall in line behind the United States.“On the one hand, Germans are becoming more skeptical about Russia, but on the other hand, people are still using anti-Americanism as a tool,” Mr. von Klaeden said. “All the constructive things that the Americans have done in the past year haven’t been welcomed here.”For Germany, analysts say, the most immediate effect of the deepening rift is to undermine Mrs. Merkel’s efforts to forge closer economic and trade ties between the European Union and Russia. That had been a hallmark of her term as president of the European Union.“Germany had prepared a very constructive new ‘Ostpolitik’ toward Russia,” said Alexander Rahr, an expert on Russia at the German Council on Foreign Relations, referring to a policy of incremental steps to bring both sides closer. “That is now being destroyed.”Mr. Rahr said the rift would put Mrs. Merkel in an increasingly awkward position because, while she hopes to preserve Germany’s close ties to Russia, she does not want to antagonize the Bush administration.“I don’t understand why Putin came out like he did,” Mr. Rahr said. “It was much too harsh; it was a strategic mistake.”'"
"'07-04-28,'0','Was that blood? Probably not, but it wasn’t easy to tell. Bradford Cox was onstage at the Mercury Lounge on Thursday night, leading his Atlanta-based band, Deerhunter, through an impressive and slightly disconcerting set. The place was packed, though it got a bit less packed as the night wore on.No doubt some of the people were there out of curiosity: Deerhunter’s immersive “Cryptograms” (Kranky), released in January, has emerged as one of the year’s most talked-about indie-rock albums, and the music Web site Pitchfork has been particularly enthusiastic. But Deerhunter isn’t the kind of band that aims to convert casual (or unadventurous) listeners, and in any case the live show is much more savage than the album.So: that red stuff, whatever it was, was all over Mr. Cox’s face and hands. And while his bandmates struck up a series of brisk, efficient grooves, he put a microphone through its paces, often processing his yelps using digital effects; sometimes the microphone disappeared into his mouth entirely, like some small but dangerous animal looking for a warm home. Mr. Cox is, as he once put it, “really, really thin,” and he’s a riveting presence onstage, careering into his nonchalant bandmates with that cord coming out of his mouth.“Cryptograms” is the second full-length Deerhunter album, and it demonstrates that a once-jagged band has fallen hard for haziness. Clouds of sound slowly form and dissipate, and Mr. Cox’s processed vocals are only half intelligible, or less than half. Some songs, like the furious “Lake Somerset,” seem propelled by some obscure malevolent energy; others, like the dreamy “Hazel St.,” are pretty and open-ended. A new mini-CD, “Fluorescent Grey” (Kranky), includes “Like New,” which is unexpectedly soft and delicate, but just as mysterious.For years, Pitchfork’s reviews have been indie rock’s most influential, and a glowing review can earn a formerly obscure band lots of attention, not all of it kind. In the case of Deerhunter, boosters and bashers alike are waiting to see what happens next. What exactly is a high Pitchfork score worth these days? How many people want to watch a man eat a microphone? How big a venue can Deerhunter sell out? And how many people will last till the end?Needless to say, none of this is Deerhunter’s fault. Certainly the members didn’t look very concerned on Thursday night. If they had seen the industry-heavy room get a little roomier during their set, they probably would have been amused. And while it’s easy to chuckle at the microcycles of praise and backlash that characterize the Internet music age, it’s not hard to see the upside. In an earlier era, a weird, intense band like Deerhunter might well have remained a secret. Not these days.'"
"'07-04-28,'0','Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg yesterday appointed a new transportation commissioner charged with putting in place the transportation-oriented initiatives that are part of the mayor’s program for keeping the city environmentally sound.But the commissioner, Janette Sadik-Khan, will not be able to limit her focus to glamorous innovations like enhanced bus lanes and new technologies intended to help traffic move faster. The mayor said he was in the habit of calling his transportation commissioner when his car hit a pothole to insist that the hole be filled in.At a City Hall press conference to announce the selection of Ms. Sadik-Khan, an executive at the engineering firm Parsons Brinckerhoff, the mayor also said the city would seek federal money to help pay for some of his recent transportation proposals, including a congestion-pricing plan that would charge vehicles to drive in the most crowded part of Manhattan at the busiest time.The money would come from $1.2 billion that the federal Department of Transportation has set aside to finance projects to ease urban traffic.The department set Monday as the deadline for cities or metropolitan areas to submit congestion-fighting proposals.In a letter yesterday to Transportation Secretary Mary E. Peters, the mayor said he was submitting a “conditional application” for the federal financing, which the city would later amend after consulting Gov. Eliot Spitzer and members of the State Legislature. Any congestion-pricing program would need the approval of the Legislature.'"
"'07-04-28,'0','The Food and Drug Administration has rejected Merck & Company’s bid to win approval for a successor to Vioxx, the arthritis medication that Merck withdrew from the market more than two years ago, the company said yesterday.The decision had been widely expected ever since a panel of F.D.A. advisers voted two weeks ago by 20 to 1 against approval of the drug, Arcoxia, because of concerns that it could cause as many as 30,000 heart attacks a year if widely used.Like Vioxx, whose name has become almost synonymous with drug safety problems, Arcoxia is among a class of anti-inflammatory drugs called cox-2 inhibitors. Such medications were developed in the hope that they would be less likely to cause stomach bleeding than ibuprofen and naproxen.But while they did prove to safeguard the stomach, they have been linked to heart risks. Merck withdrew Vioxx in September 2004 after research showed that it doubled the risk of heart attacks and strokes.Despite the safety concerns in the United States, Arcoxia is on sale in 63 other countries. It brought in revenue of $265 million last year.'"
"'07-04-28,'0','San Diego will pay about $68,000 this year in one way or another for music in the pavilion, including half the civic organist’s salary and a contribution to the Spreckels Organ Society, which pays the rest and organizes summer evening concerts under Dr. Williams’s direction — all part of a unique city treasure, according to George Biaggi, the deputy press secretary to Mayor Jerry Sanders. “We’re strong supporters,” Mr. Biaggi said, despite a long-running city budget crisis.Dr. Williams, who earned her doctorate at the Manhattan School of Music in 2001, works the organ’s four keyboards and pedal board out in the elements, often in a chill Pacific breeze.The organ can be stentorian and can more than hold its own, even with the jet planes roaring into the airport down the hill. Adults, children, even dogs, attracted by the sound, drift in and sit in the sun — or wrap up against the ocean breeze — and listen.“They’ll probably hear this in New York City,” Dr. Williams told them the other day before tearing into a toccata, tossing her long black hair and showing a bit of leg as she jumped up onto the organ bench.Lyle W. Blackinton, the organ curator, keeps the pipes in tune, the vagaries of weather permitting, and helps Dr. Williams keep her music sheets from blowing away.By the time she finished a program that also included a work by the contemporary Welsh composer Karl Jenkins, a transcription of Duke Ellington’s “Solitude” and the early-20th-century French organist Louis Vierne’s “Carillon de Westminster,” on the theme of Big Ben’s chimes, a couple of hundred people were listening. The special summer concerts draw up to 4,200.“Even when it’s a rainy Sunday, people will gather onstage,” she said.She starts every concert with an arrangement of “America the Beautiful” and finishes with “The Star-Spangled Banner,” ending with a crash of cymbals (real ones that are part of the instrument; the organ also has a stop that imitates a harp).“Sunday afternoons have to be, in a way, entertaining,” she said, “but there’s nothing wrong with that. The organ has a future, if people play what audiences want to listen to.”Among the pieces she has played are “How Much Is That Doggie in the Window?” and “Mad Dogs and Englishmen,” at a concert in February called “Bark in the Park,” a benefit for the San Diego Humane Society.It was a jazz electronic organ that belonged to an aunt in England, near her parents’ home southwest of London, near Aldershot, that got her hooked on the instrument.“I had started piano at age 5, but then when my aunt bought the organ, that was it,” she said. “I grew up playing jazz organ, and then studied organ at the Royal Academy of Music.”She saw an advertisement for the civic organist post while she was finishing her doctorate in New York. Now she has a Mustang with “CIV ORG” plates, and she and her fiancé, Kerry Bell, a videographer, plan to drive up to the pavilion on Oct. 20 to be married there, with some of her predecessors doing the honors.Many cities in America had municipal organists 100 or 75 years ago, before phonographs, stereos, CD players or iPods; they hired them to play not only organ music but also transcriptions of symphonic and band music, on pipe organs built to imitate the sounds of orchestras, and keep the citizenry entertained.Tens of thousands of people flocked to hear municipal organs in places from San Francisco to San Diego, and from Chattanooga, Tenn., to Portland, Me., all with instruments by the Austin Organ Company of Hartford, which operates today as Austin Organs Inc.Outdoor organ playing has some unique challenges. The worst Dr. Williams remembers facing was a huge beetle that landed on the pedal board next to her foot one evening — “on the second page of a concerto,” she said.A fellow musician came to the rescue and brushed the beast away.'"
"'07-04-28,'0','The big difference between a car salesman and the college of your child’s dreams is that the salesman probably doesn’t know how much you are capable of spending, and he doesn’t know what other dealers’ cars you are considering. The colleges do, thanks to the Free Application for Federal Student Aid that most parents complete.“They will know an awful lot about the family’s financial situation,” said Kathleen Dawley, president of Maguire Associates, an enrollment-management consultant.Her company is part of an industry that advises colleges on strategies for attracting the kinds of students that they need to achieve particular goals, including how to use financial aid to entice the students.Parents hardly stand a chance because they will never know as much about the school’s admissions plans and policies as the colleges know about a parent’s hopes. Return to that car lot for a moment. When you buy a car, it is possible to get an approximate idea of the price the dealer paid for it and how much demand exists for a particular model.A buyer of education cannot hope to get detailed information about how flexible a college can be in offering financial aid. Still, there is some power in knowledge, so it’s important to understand the award letter, the opening salvo of negotiations for student aid.“Do it very carefully,” warns Robert Shireman, president of the Institute for College Access and Success, an advocacy group based in Berkeley, Calif., “because colleges that are trying very hard to get someone to enroll sometimes sound better than they are.”The colleges won’t make it easy to compare offers. Although they want all your financial information in a standardized format, they refuse to return that favor. So every offer looks different. They even use different terms for the same thing.For example, a letter from the University of Pittsburgh offers $1,200 in a “PHEAA,” a term for a state grant that it doesn’t bother to explain. The college assumes that most students know what it is. (They certainly might after revelations last month about members of the Pennsylvania Higher Education Assistance Agency spending money on cigars, facials, cooking lessons and falconry lessons.)The student and parents need to sort through the information by focusing on out-of-pocket costs. They do that by tallying the free money the school is offering. Do not include any form of loans in this category. Loans are money the student or parents must pay back.“They mention them to seem like they are giving you more than they are,” said Mark Kantrowitz, publisher of the FinAid.org and EduPASS.org Web sites and a student financial aid consultant.Subtract the total “free money” from the cost of attending to determine out-of-pocket expenses. But watch out for obfuscation in how the school calculates the total cost of attendance. It includes tuition, room and board and fees. Those are pretty hard to fudge. But the cost of books or transportation are also included in that sum, and it sometimes is not accurate.Mr. Kantrowitz has put a calculator on his Web site (www.finaid.org/calculators/awardletter.phtml) that allows three schools to be compared. It will take a little time to look up and fill in the information. Sallie Mae, which is in the business of selling loans to students, also has one, www.collegeanswer.com/deciding/award-comparison/ac_index.jsp. It requires registration and isn’t much easier to use. “The reason they are complicated is because the issue is complicated,” Mr. Shireman said.Mr. Shireman recommended the Web site FinancialAidLetter.com for clues on how to decode the offers. The site was created by Kim Clark, a senior writer for U.S. News and World Report, while serving as a Kiplinger fellow at Ohio State University. (A disclosure: I hired Ms. Clark when I was an editor at the magazine.)The site has a glossary of all the terms colleges use in the award letters, but the highlight is the section called Letter Decoder. Ms. Clark has posted a number of actual letters and helpfully translates and grades them. She also includes explanations from the college and from other experts of the offers.“A lot of the schools are doing themselves a disservice,” she said. Indeed, she has found instances where colleges would look better if they had been clearer about scholarships versus loans.Any school’s determination of a family’s financial contribution will tend to be the same across the board, Mr. Kantrowitz said, because of the formulas based on the financial data submitted to the school. What does differ is the out-of-pocket cost, which is the cost of attendance, minus the gift aid. “That reflects the discounted price of the institution,” he said. (That’s more akin to a car’s invoice price of a car.)How low the school sets that discount price is determined by how desirable that student is to the school and how wealthy that school is. The enrollment management experts have counseled the colleges on the concept of leveraging, which is the black art of determining the minimum amount of money to dangle in front of a student to get them to enroll.The colleges are trying to maximize the tuition revenue. Grants and scholarships diminish that revenue. Loans do not. So a college is trying to get the parent to accept as much financing in the financial aid package as possible.It is important to note what kind of loan is in the package. A Perkins Loan is the best kind because it carries an interest rate of 5 percent, with the interest deferred while the student is in college.With all the loans, look for one with low fees. It is hard to trust any school’s “preferred lender” list after the revelation that some college officials received compensation from lenders. Loans may carry a college’s name because lenders have learned that the college’s imprimatur makes it sound like a better loan and a good deal.Ask a lender if it has signed the New York attorney general’s College Code of Conduct. That is a promise to not take compensation from lenders and to behave ethically in business dealings with student borrowers.If you think the colleges really want your child, it may be worth asking them to reconsider. You may have some leverage if another college offered a better deal. “For the most part, the best offer is on the table,” said Ms. Dawley, the enrollment-management consultant. But while colleges know who else is offering aid, they don’t know what the other specific offers are.Colleges are also keeping tallies on a daily basis on the number of students who are accepting and what kind of students are accepting. They worry about what percentage of offers are accepted because that can help determine their rankings on “Best Colleges” lists.Depending on how its class of 2011 is shaping up, you may have an opportunity to eke out a bit more. But there is no way to know whether they need more female flute-playing chemical engineering students or Chinese-American poets from Alabama who also golf.A college could just as easily say take it or leave it, because many institutions have a sizable waiting list. “They know they can replace that student from the list, and they know who on the list might require less financial commitment from the institution,” Ms. Dawley said.They know parents can’t just walk off the lot and wait for prices to go down next year.'"
"'07-04-28,'0','The accidental shooting of David C. Brinkerhoff, the New York state trooper who was killed by a bullet from a fellow trooper confronting a suspect inside a Catskill farmhouse on Wednesday, puts Trooper Brinkerhoff in a small minority of police officers killed in the line of duty.In the annals of law enforcement history, cases of officers dying at the hands of their own colleagues have been exceedingly rare. According to the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund, from 1893 through 2006, about 18,000 officers were killed on the job — but only 198 of them at the hand of a fellow officer.Put another way, slightly more than 1 percent of all officers killed in the line of duty were killed by bullets fired by their colleagues. In the last decade, in fact, more officers have died in traffic-related accidents than by gunfire of any kind.About 57,000 officers are assaulted every year, but with the introduction of Kevlar body armor in 1974, the number who suffer fatal injuries has decreased.Experts said yesterday that many deaths involving gunfire from colleagues were caused by crossfire between teams of officers who were firing at the same assailant. In Trooper Brinkerhoff’s case, the police said that as he entered a farmhouse in pursuit of a suspect near Margaretville, N.Y., the suspect fired at him, hitting Trooper Brinkerhoff’s body armor. That bullet threw him off balance, and he was then hit once in the head during the gunfire that followed from three other troopers.That situation mirrored others in recent years. Earlier this month, a veteran F.B.I. agent was killed in New Jersey when he was hit by a bullet from another agent’s gun as the agents swarmed a group of robbery suspects outside a bank. Three years before that, in June 2004, a deputy sheriff in Los Angeles was accidentally shot in the neck by a fellow officer as they surrounded a gunman outside a motel and opened fire.'"

"'07-04-29,'0','""Mosquitoes again! They are just relentless! Maybe the world just needs a giant can of bug spray.""My brother has always teased me about having a morbid curiosity. I have always objected to this, although receiving daily emails about infectious disease incidence and outbreak reports is certainly not exactly helping me my case. The teasing started when I was eleven years old and I voluntarily sat still long enough to read a chapter of The Hot Zone, by Richard Preston. I never really enjoyed reading when I was a kid. I much preferred playing sports or running around outside, but this book was different. After I read the first chapter I was happy to skip swim team practice to stay home and read. The thriller about scientists' efforts to identify, contain and treat the Ebola virus fascinated me and inspired me so much that upon finishing it, I declared to my family ""That's what I want to do!""I suppose that is how I found myself, over a decade later, stepping into a biohazard suit to enter a pressure-locked AIDS research laboratory, and later, harvesting and growing brain stem cells. Working as a research technician during and after college in a laboratory devoted to curing AIDS, and another dedicated towards understanding brain tumors was like a dream come true. The innovative molecular biology techniques, complex animal modeling and international collaborations between laboratories was exhilarating and exciting, and filled me with optimism- in the beginning anyway. As I became more involved in different research projects, I realized the huge volume of information the scientific community has yet to figure out, and my enthusiasm for solving health problems through science dwindled. With problems like AIDS, heart disease, malaria, and malnutrition, the world cannot afford to wait for research to strike gold. These problems cannot afford the luxury of time.Scientific research is certainly not fruitless, but I think it's important to look beyond biology and the physical environment in the fight against disease. I believe that we need to use social epidemiology to study the social, economic and political contributing factors of disease and poor health, in order to create and institute more timely and perhaps more effective preventive and curative measures. The countries of Africa are in dire need of these studies, as they house the world's most serious, but also preventable health crises.Like biological research, epidemiological research a hefty task, but completing it is far simpler. The root of social epidemiology is observation: talking to the people, witnessing their living conditions, feeling their struggles, and understanding their cultures. I want to go to Africa to actively participate in social epidemiology. I want to do more than read about disease, or think about what studies or preventions have yet to be done. Despite my participation in research and my education, I do not feel that I truly understand the health issues of Africa, because I am lacking the emotions, feelings, and personal connections that only first hand experience can elicit and provide. It is this intangibility of first hand experience and social that will help me better understand the root of health problems and how to best improve them. I am determined help improve Africa's health problems by one day going to Africa, and collecting and sharing my own personal experiences and observations. The only thing in question is when and how I will get there.'"

"'07-04-29,'0','They did so much more. In their first home playoff game in 13 years, the Warriors gave credence to the slogan printed on 20,000 yellow T-shirts that filled the arena: “We believe.” They made the Mavericks look nervous and disjointed. They made Nelson look falsely modest.“It’s true, it’s true. Would I lie to you?” Nelson said with a straight face.Golden State’s performance suggested that he might. Baron Davis, the swaggering point guard, scored 24 points. Jason Richardson, one of the longest-tenured (and thus longest-suffering) Warriors, had 30 points. Golden State shot 52 percent through three quarters, held Dallas to 38.8 percent in the game and stifled Dirk Nowitzki, the presumed favorite for most valuable player.Nowitzki had 20 points, 4 after halftime, and looked ordinary. There could be no more ominous sign for the Mavericks and their championship aspirations. In their drive to the N.B.A. finals last year, the Mavericks dispatched with the well-worn cliché about a “soft” personality. They are on the verge of making it relevant again.Dallas has lost six of its past seven playoff games, including the last four in the 2006 finals. Miami, which beat Dallas for the championship, is down by 3-0 to Chicago and appears headed for a quick exit. The Mavericks, if they cannot solve the Warriors’ maddening brand of small ball in Sunday’s Game 4, could be next.Coach Avery Johnson has refashioned the Mavericks as a defensive team, but they let the Warriors drive at will and score 52 points in the paint. Dallas has thrived on crisp passing and patience but is shooting .407 in the series. The Mavericks are being dismantled by a team that won 42 games in the regular season.“We just didn’t have the passion and the fire and the intensity and the physicality to win this game,” Johnson said Friday. “It’s hard to explain at this point in the season. But we got to consistently get our swagger back, and we better get it quickly.”Only two teams seeded No. 1 have lost in the first round since the N.B.A. adopted its current playoff format in 1984: Miami (to the Knicks) in 1999 and Seattle (to Denver) in 1994.The Warriors could still be regarded as long shots, except that they have beaten Dallas in six of their past seven games. Nelson, the N.B.A.’s master of unconventionality, has confounded Dallas, his former team, and Johnson, his former assistant.Golden State started three guards and two small forwards — with the 6-foot-9 Al Harrington at center — for Games 1 and 2. Johnson countered by shifting Nowitzki to center to start Game 1, and it backfired in a 97-85 loss.For Game 2, Johnson went back to his usual lineup, with Erick Dampier at center, and the Mavericks — aided in part by the ejections of Davis and Stephen Jackson — took a 112-99 victory.Nelson struck again in Game 3, however, starting the 6-11 Andris Biedrins instead of the slumping Harrington. The Warriors raced to an 11-point lead in the first quarter.The Mavericks looked confused and maybe a little tight, though that was not a description Johnson wanted to hear.“Why should a team that’s been in seven playoff series together, been to the Western Conference semifinals, won some big games last year in the playoffs, been to the finals, why should we be tight?” Johnson said Saturday.His voice was, well, taut — at least compared with the carefree expressions found in the Warriors’ gym.“We just want to stay humble and win the series before we start talking crazy,” Jackson said.The silver ink on his shoes suggested something else: “Shock Da World.” Jackson scrawled those words before the series started. Some underdogs bark.'"
"'07-04-29,'0','Visiting Baltimore was leading by 2-1 in the top of the third with Nick Markakis on third base and Miguel Tejada on first and one out. Ramón Hernández then hit a line drive to center field and Grady Sizemore made a diving catch. Markakis tagged up and headed for home. Tejada was around second when the ball was caught and was thrown out trying to get back to first. It appeared Markakis crossed the plate well before Tejada was called out at first, but the plate umpire Marvin Hudson waved off the run.After the Indians scored a run in the fifth to tie the score at 2-2, it was announced in the bottom of the sixth that the Orioles’ run in the third counted, giving Baltimore a 3-2 lead.TWINS 11, TIGERS 3 Justin Morneau homered and Minnesota roughed up Justin Verlander. Morneau had three hits and scored three times for the visiting Twins, who reached base 23 times — 17 hits, 5 walks and a hit batter — against five Tigers pitchers.RANGERS 9, BLUE JAYS 8 Hank Blalock atoned for an earlier error with a sacrifice fly in the 10th inning to lift Texas to victory at Toronto.Michael Young hit a one-out double in the 10th and stole third. Mark Teixeira walked and Sammy Sosa was walked intentionally by Brian Tallet (0-1) before Blalock flied out to the warning track in center to drive in Young.ANGELS 3, WHITE SOX 0 Jered Weaver pitched five and two-thirds innings for his first victory of the season and Gary Matthews Jr. led off the game with a home run to help visiting Los Angeles.CUBS 8, CARDINALS 1 Jacque Jones hit a bases-loaded triple in a seven-run fifth inning to lead visiting Chicago. Carlos Zambrano (2-2) is unbeaten against St. Louis in his past eight starts, going 5-0 with a 1.54 earned run average over that stretch.MARLINS 11, PHILLIES 5 Dontrelle Willis struggled through six and a third innings, but Miguel Cabrera had a career-best five hits and Josh Willingham hit a three-run homer for visiting Florida. Willis (5-1) allowed nine hits and five runs.REDS 8, PIRATES 1 Matt Belisle did not allow a baserunner until the sixth inning and finished with a five-hitter for his first complete game and visiting Cincinnati ended Pittsburgh’s five-game winning streak.ASTROS 10, BREWERS 1 Craig Biggio had a triple and drove in three runs and host Houston snapped a seven-game losing streak. Chris Sampson (3-1) struck out eight, his highest total in seven career starts.PREGNANT THERAPIST IS LEAVING Kelly Calabrese, the San Diego Padres’ sports therapist who was belittled on the air last year by Keith Hernandez, will leave the team before the All-Star Game break because she is pregnant with her first child.'"
"'07-04-29,'0','Mostly, Mr. McCain addressed a handful of central issues. He explained why he continued to support a heavy troop presence in Iraq, saying that the war would “follow us home” if the mission failed — but always being sure to add that the war had been “terribly mismanaged.” And he spoke at length about the wasteful spending in Washington, which he lamented had been continued by Republicans, and invoked President Ronald Reagan’s line that Congress spent like a drunken sailor.“I never knew a sailor, drunk or sober, that had the imagination of our Congress,” Mr. McCain said at a town hall meeting in Des Moines. “I’m not making this up when I tell you a few weeks ago I received an e-mail from a guy who said, ‘As a former drunken sailor, I resent being compared to members of Congress.’ ”During the trip, as he stopped reading his speech off prompters and began to deliver it in his own, relaxed way, he veered into unscripted areas. Several times he expressed reservations about the direction Russia was taking under President Vladimir V. Putin (“if you want to call him ‘president,’ ” he said in a pointed aside in Charleston, S.C.), saying that the Russian leader had shut down political opposition, had taken control of the news media and was being unhelpful when it came to Iran.The crowds in New Hampshire, where the kickoff began, were not terribly big, perhaps kept away from the outdoor rallies by a chill rain. But they grew more enthusiastic in South Carolina and Mr. McCain was received well at two town hall meetings in Iowa. The tour ended here, at Tempe City Hall, before a loud crowd of supporters and antiwar protesters.Along the way, Mr. McCain met protesters from the left and right. In Manchester, N.H., antiwar demonstrators held a sign that said, “Don’t bomb bomb bomb bomb bomb Iran” while a protester who felt Mr. McCain was soft on immigration appeared in a sombrero holding a sign that said, “Illegals for McCain.” Throughout the trip there were reminders of Mr. McCain’s peculiar mix of candor and humor. Asked how much time he would spend in the Senate during the campaign, he readily acknowledged, “Not a lot.”At a news conference in Columbia, S.C., Mr. McCain made a show of presenting a check to the state Republican Party. “I’d like to give you this check for $25,000 you extorted from me in order to get on the ballot,” he joked.But his biography — and the years he spent as a prisoner of war — had a way of creeping in, even in lighthearted moments. After a long discussion of policy on a bus tour, one reporter asked Mr. McCain if he was superstitious.Mr. McCain allowed that he was more likely to pick up a penny if it was showing heads than tails. His wife, Cindy, reminded him that he throws a pinch of salt over his shoulder when he knocks over the salt shaker. “I think all pilots are superstitious to some degree,” Mr. McCain said.Then he launched into an anecdote from his days in the Navy about how he used to have a superstition: each time he went to take off from the aircraft carrier Forrestal, he would hand his helmet to Tom Ott, a petty officer second class from Mississippi on the flight deck who would clean his visor before he taxied out.The anecdote turned quickly somber. “The day of the Forrestal fire, he was standing there and he’d just handed my helmet back to me when the missile hit and he was incinerated in the fire,” Mr. McCain said, recalling the explosion of an American rocket on the deck that killed 134 of his shipmates. “I always remember him with great affection but a little bit of guilt because he was standing there because of my idiosyncrasy.”Along the way, voters tried to make up their minds about him. Bob Dastin, a 73-year-old lawyer from Manchester who braved the rain to hear him speak, said he had supported Mr. McCain in 2000, and still did.“Oh, I think he’s going to have a very difficult time, considering his stance on the war,” Mr. Dastin said. “But considering the opposition, I think he’s going to have a very good chance.”'"
"'07-04-29,'0','“If the insurgency is countrywide,” wrote Sir Robert Thompson, the architect of the idea of the “new villages,” “it is impossible to tackle it offensively in every area. It must be accepted that in certain areas only a holding operation can be conducted.” Hence the concept of creating walls or fences to separate friends from foes.In practice, the British demoralized and defeated enemies of the empire, though thousands of noncombatants died in the process. The moral hazards of their methods seem fairly plain today, and therefore difficult to duplicate. But in its time, Malaya was counted as a famous victory, and the land of present-day Malaysia is peaceful and relatively prosperous.“The results speak for themselves,” notes Lt. Col. Wade Markel, a United States Army strategist, writing last year in Parameters, the quarterly journal of the Army War College: by 1957, the number of insurgents had declined sharply — to perhaps 200 active combatants from an estimated 8,000 five years earlier — allowing a new Malay government to take shape.“Short-term, it was a success,” said Caroline Elkins, a Pulitzer Prize-winning historian whose field is the twilight of British empire. “But what happens within these walls? The British argued that they were winning hearts and minds. But behind the walls, it’s all about forcing people to cooperate.”Winning the allegiance of civilians within the walls required a strong political will and a degree of violence, she said, and “the British were much more brutal than the Americans were willing to be in Vietnam.”Sir Robert transplanted his theory to South Vietnam, and American advisers in Saigon embraced it in 1962. But they were never skillful enough — or tough enough — to sort out their foes, the Vietcong insurgents, from their South Vietnamese friends behind the stockade fences of their “strategic hamlets.”When an American-backed coup took down the Saigon government in November 1963, the hamlets strategy went with it. The Americans could not clear and hold the jungle, and within a year the Vietcong were using roadside bombs, car bombs, and suicide bombers in Saigon. Half a million American troops followed.Forty years later, after building billion-dollar bases walled off from Iraqis, American officers are embracing the strategies and tactics of counterinsurgency under the new Baghdad security plan, which adapts concepts used in the countrysides of Malaya and Vietnam to Iraq’s urban centers.Building concrete walls in Baghdad and controlling gated communities across Iraq is a crucial part of that plan. In the near future, identity cards or internal passports may be issued in an effort to isolate the enemy in Baghdad, as has been done with some success in the embattled city of Falluja.General Petraeus, who has said many times in many ways that this war cannot be won with firepower alone, may serve as the late-colonial British governor-generals once did, trying to impose order on chaos with a mix of force and social engineering — trying “to stitch together the fabric of society that was so torn,” as he said Thursday, while building more and more walls to filter out the infiltrators.His commanders know that the loyalties of the people of Iraq are the battlefield where the war will be won or lost. The officers have been reading the classics of counterinsurgency, especially the work of David Galula, a French military officer who fought Algerian rebels in their war of independence 50 years ago. Though the French failed there, Galula’s insights still resonate.“If we distinguish between people and rebels, then we have a chance,” he wrote. But that is only a start: “Political, social, economic and other reforms, however much they ought to be wanted and popular, are inoperative when offered while the insurgent still controls the population.”He continued: “So intricate is the interplay between political and military actions that they cannot be tidily separated; on the contrary, every military move has to be weighed with regard to its political effects.”This is where the Adhamiya wall may have undermined itself. Many hundreds of residents protested in the streets against the wall last week, and their anger flowed from more than the traffic jams the wall had created. The imam of the district’s main mosque called it “the beginning of a huge plan intended to divide Baghdad ethnically and according to sect.”Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki said it reminded people of “other walls.” Rightly or wrongly, some Iraqis compared it to the Berlin Wall and the barrier that Israel has built against the Palestinians.To date, more than 3,000 American soldiers, 3,500 Iraqi soldiers, and 4,500 Iraqi policemen have died in this war. They have won many battles, but they have not held many battlefields long enough to keep peace, provide security, or establish enough trust to rebuild a shattered society. It will be months before anyone knows if the new strategy will work. But it seems unlikely that any wall can last too long with enemies on both sides.'"
"'07-04-29,'0','On the heels of a major Supreme Court setback for women’s reproductive rights, Gov. Eliot Spitzer has produced a sound proposal aimed at shoring up those rights in New York State. His timely initiative, which would update the state’s abortion laws and inoculate them as much as possible from federal anti-abortion edicts, should be acted on quickly by lawmakers in Albany and emulated by other states.New York’s pioneering law legalizing abortion, which Gov. Nelson Rockefeller signed in 1970, predated Roe v. Wade by three years. The provisions lifting the old abortion prohibition, and allowing abortion in many cases, are part of the state’s homicide law, which is not the right place for them. Mr. Spitzer’s updating would remove abortion from the criminal statutes and affirmatively make it a matter of professional and medical discretion. His proposal would also repeal an outmoded statute, previously overturned by the courts, that criminalizes providing nonprescription contraception to minors.Beyond that cleanup, the proposed legislation would enshrine in state law Roe’s core protections, expressly protecting a woman’s right to terminate a pregnancy prior to fetal viability, and making clear that her life and health take precedence over the rights of the fetus throughout pregnancy.Joseph Bruno, the Republican majority leader of the State Senate, has indicated that he has no interest in moving forward with Mr. Spitzer’s proposal. But with Republican control of the Senate now whittled down to just a few seats, blocking the abortion rights initiative carries real political risks. It would not be surprising if Mr. Bruno developed a sudden interest in the bill as legislative elections drew closer.New York, like other states, lacks the authority to undo the Congressional ban on so-called partial birth abortion just upheld by the Supreme Court. That is regrettable, since the ban endangers women because of its lack of any exception to protect a woman’s health. The Spitzer bill cannot reverse the ruling. But it can put important protections in place in the event that the Supreme Court scales back federal abortion rights further, or even repeals Roe v. Wade entirely, handing the issue back to the states.'"
"'07-04-29,'0','The result is that few adults want to have anything to do with them, and manipulating and abducting children becomes the best way to sustain the organized banditry.This dynamic has fueled some of the longest-running conflicts on the continent, and it could be seen this month alone in at least three countries:In Somalia, within the last month, more than 1,000 people have been killed in Mogadishu, the capital, in a complex civil war compounded by warlords who command armies of teenagers. The war traces to 1991, when the central government was brought down by clans fighting over old grievances. But soon it became a contest among the warlords for control of airports, seaports and access to international aid. Sixteen years later, they are still blasting away.In Congo, a civil war that started a decade ago to oust the cold-war-era tyrant Mobutu Sese Seko is now a multiheaded fight in which only one of the players is the government. The rest are rebel posses fighting among themselves for a share of the timber, copper, gold, diamonds and other resources. All sides, according to a report issued this month by Human Rights Watch, rely on child soldiers.In Uganda, the latest in a series of peace talks — none successful so far — resumed last week, in an effort to end a reign of terror in rural areas by the Lord’s Resistance Army. That group was mustered in the late 1990s in the name of the oppressed Acholi minority, but it soon degenerated into a drugged-out street gang living in the jungle with military-grade weaponry and 13-year-old brides. Its ranks are filled with boys who have been brainwashed to burn down huts and pound newborn babies to death in wooden mortars, as if they were grinding grain.Africa didn’t invent the modern under-age soldier. The Nazis drafted adolescents when they got desperate. So did Iran, which gave boys 12 to 16 years old plastic keys to heaven to hang around their necks as they cleared minefields during the Iran-Iraq War. Young teenagers have fought in religion-driven or nationalistic fights in Kosovo, the Palestinian territories and Afghanistan.But here, in Africa, armed movements that survive on children as young as 9 have acquired a special character, nourished by breakdowns of state power or ideology. Many of these movements are about raw greed, power and brutality, with no effort to make excuses for it.“There might have been a little rhetoric at the beginning,” said Ishmael Beah, a former child soldier in Sierra Leone and author of the best seller “A Long Way Gone: Memoirs of a Boy Soldier.” “But very quickly the ideology gets lost. And then it just becomes a bloodbath, a way for the commanders to plunder, a war of madness.”Neil Boothby, a Columbia University professor who has worked with child soldiers across the world, said this new crop of movements lacked the features associated with the winning insurgencies of yesteryear — a charming, intelligent leader, persuasive vocabulary, the goal of taking cities.The typical rebel leader emerging today wants most of all to run his criminal enterprise deep in the bush. “These are brutally thuggy people who don’t want to rule politically and have no strategy for winning a war,” Dr. Boothby said.This is a sharp change from the liberation movements of the 1970s and 1980s and the cause-driven conflicts that followed — for example, those in Zimbabwe or Eritrea. Even Rwanda’s 1994 genocide followed some familiar patterns: It remained a contest, however gruesome, for political power between two ethnic groups. And children, by and large, were the victims of atrocities by adults, rather than the other way around.William Reno, a political scientist at Northwestern University who studies armed movements, said: “If you look back 30 years at how wars were fought in Africa, they were liberation movements — freeing their countries from apartheid or colonial rule. They had to plug into Soviet aid or American aid, and the superpowers wanted to see a state, a vision of the future.”“The people who ended up doing well,” he said, “were the college-educated ideologues.”Their plans may have been dreamy. But at least, they had plans.“We saw a lot of that in the 1980s,” said Chester Crocker, who was assistant secretary of state for Africa in the Reagan administration from 1981 to 1989. “For marketing reasons, leaders would dress themselves up in ideas.”“Of course,” he added, “we always took it with a grain of salt.”This charade ended with the cold war. Weak states that had been propped up by foreign aid and outside military assistance quickly collapsed. And Eastern bloc countries that had been cranking out Kalashnikovs for the Soviet Army had to find new markets. Africa, with its unpatrolled skies and endless shorelines, its gold mines and diamond mines and free-flowing cash economies, beckoned.The result, Dr. Reno said, was that the political landscape opened up to well-armed opportunists, no longer inconvenienced by state regulations, state security or moral principles. “When there isn’t that big barrier anymore,” he said, “all these weird things start to happen.”Like the use of child soldiers, who are often drawn into these movements, or kept there, with magic and superstition.In many armed movements, children are taught that life and death depend on spirits, which are conjured up by their commanders and distilled in oils and amulets. Magic can spur children to do unspeakable things. It also bestows otherwise lackluster leaders with a veneer of supernatural respectability. “The commanders would wear certain pearls and said that guns wouldn’t hurt us,” Mr. Beah recalled. “And we believed it.”Renamo, the South African-backed rebel army that terrorized Mozambique in the 1980s as it tried to destabilize the Marxist government, was among the first to turn to magic; it carved out a special role for witch doctors, whom the Marxists had marginalized.By the time groups in Congo took that technique to its lowest depths in the late 1990s — some child soldiers there were instructed that eating their victims made them stronger — the world started paying attention. Advocates succeeded in placing the child soldier issue on the United Nations agenda and passing protocols that called for the age of combatants to be at least 18 (the United States and the United Kingdom are among the countries that have refused to sign).But renegade armed groups continue to be a stumbling block. As lawlessness spreads, they too are spreading, from the bush to urban-area slums, where violent, quasi-religious movements seem to be taking root.“It’s ridiculous to appeal to human rights with these groups because they are so far on the criminal end of the spectrum,” said Victoria Forbes Adam, director of the London-based Coalition to Stop the Use of Child Soldiers.Just this month, in a shantytown near Nairobi, Kenya’s capital, enforcers from a group called the Mungiki — essentially a street gang that uses teenage muscle — hacked up several opponents in an effort to control the minibus racket. True to form, their leader has told his young henchmen that he rolled to earth in a ball of stars.'"
"'07-04-29,'0','Beginning in the late 1980s and early 1990s, digital editing arrived, allowing a team’s video coordinator to move instantaneously to any point in a game. Still, searching for appropriate snippets was hard, so long as no index had been prepared to list which players were in which frame.Particularly for basketball, a game in which many players interact with one another at any given moment, a highly granular description of what happens in every play was needed. Traditional statistics failed to capture the complexity.Garrick Barr, who was video coordinator for the Phoenix Suns for 11 years, said, “Coaches wanted to know, ‘Which play types are hurting us?’ ” Box scores were of little help.In 1998, Mr. Barr founded a company that logged every N.B.A. game, closely tracking every offensive play and then generating an “offensive tendency report” for every player.Eleven teams subscribed in the first year, but these reports offered only numbers. What his system needed were the videos, too.In 2000, Mr. Barr and Nils B. Lahr, a former Microsoft engineer, started Synergy Sports Technology in Phoenix, to bring together for N.B.A. coaches fine-grained statistics matched with associated video clips. Want to stop Dirk Nowitzki of the Dallas Mavericks? Synergy’s system has recorded every offensive step Mr. Nowitzki has made since he joined the league in 1998. Synergy has captured, for example, how successful he is driving right, or left, differentiating between home and away games, and further slicing and dicing into sub-sub-sub-categories. Click on any statistic and you can get video clips from the last three seasons of 20, or 50, or even 2,000 plays that show Nowitzki making that particular move.Four teams signed up for Synergy’s beta service in the 2004-05 season. Mark Cuban, the owner of one of those intrepid first teams, the Dallas Mavericks, liked what he saw and became Synergy’s primary outside investor. When the service was formally rolled out for the 2005-06 season, the two teams that reached the finals happened to be the Mavericks and the Miami Heat, another Synergy client.Most teams, however, did not jump to subscribe, and Mr. Barr groped for the most effective way of describing the value of his service to general managers. When he tried the phrase “it’s Google for basketball,” one manager excitedly said, “Now that’s something I can take to my owner.”This season, Synergy’s client list expanded to 14 N.B.A. teams from 4. As always happens with new technology, the first customers have a momentary edge over competitors, but the lead disappears when the others decide that paying up is an unavoidable cost of being in the business.While Synergy concentrated on a niche by addressing the needs of coaches, the N.B.A. two years ago began an eight-year digitization project for all of its constituencies, including fans, to absorb 400,000 hours of games and highlights from videotape. The project currently has available 1.2 petabytes of storage. (A petabyte is about one million gigabytes.)This season, the league gave its teams access to its growing digital video library. It now has 3,650 games, which covers the last two seasons of N.B.A. games, as well as some archival footage and non-N.B.A. games. Each game is dissected and tagged, play by play, using about 200 descriptive categories, including some for offensive possessions, but these are not as finely drawn as Synergy’s. Nor are the league’s videos integrated with its statistics.The video archive excels, however, in its comprehensive coverage of visually interesting aspects of the game, including those used for sportscasts: dunks (five subcategories), no-look passes, buzzer beaters, chest bumps and a gamut of categories of emotion ranging from “Angry, Bored, Celebrating” to “Shocked, Smiling, Tired.”A preliminary version of a video index was introduced three seasons ago for the use of league officials who oversee officiating. When a particular official is criticized by the news media for a lame game-deciding charging call, Stu Jackson, the N.B.A. executive who oversees operations, can now call up — instantly — every similar call by that official.The usefulness of the N.B.A. archive depends on the detailed descriptions written by its staff for every play of a game. The specialized needs of Synergy’s clients — coaches — require the addition of still more details to the N.B.A.’s play-by-play narrative.The company offers an easy way for a team’s coaching staff to prepare a set of clips that can be downloaded to an iPod.Some players appreciate the convenience of being able to prepare privately for the defensive assignment in the next game. Others resist having their pregame ritual usurped by a homework assignment. One N.B.A. team bought iPods for every player; that naturally removed an excuse a player might have for not “watching film” to prepare for a game.David Griffin, the assistant general manager for the Phoenix Suns and one of Synergy’s customers, is excited about integrating statistics, video and a third component — a scouting database — as Synergy has begun to record and log college games for this purpose. “In a way, that’s never happened before,” Mr. Griffin said. “We’re able to dissect a player like never before.”If coverage can expand from the professional to the college level, maybe high school and junior high will eventually follow. Similar tools will be adopted by other sports, too. Mr. Barr said his company has been approached by individuals who want to gauge his company’s interest in building out parallel services for football in the United States and soccer in England. Mr. Barr has discovered that the insight shared within the basketball fraternity is shared by coaches in other sports. “The statistics point you in the right direction,” he said, “but to understand, you have to watch the video.” Mr. Griffin, of the Phoenix Suns, predicted, “Eventually, everybody will be able to see anything you want to see, any time.”PROFESSIONAL basketball provides a working example of the unblinking eye that someday may hover above all workplaces. Until now, we have enjoyed protection from continuous scrutiny simply because subsequent watching of raw, unedited video was too time-consuming to be worth the trouble to supervisors.The breakthrough in professional sports was the development of technology that strips away the inessential and dispenses with the time-consuming editing of linear narrative.

"'07-04-29,'0','Anna Leigh Kaplon, a 14-year-old wearing shiny braces and a silver horse charm necklace, stood near the barn door of the Claremont Riding Academy on Tuesday afternoon watching a half-dozen horses trot around its 4,900-square-foot riding arena.“I’ve been crying for the past two days,” Anna Leigh said. “I haven’t slept. I’ve missed a couple days of school.”Kat Mallary, 12, said that after hearing that the venerable stable on West 89th Street would soon close, “I burst into tears and called all my friends.”“There are a lot of us barn rats,” she added. “We’re coming here as much as we can now.”Katie Brannick, a rosy-cheeked eighth grader who has been riding horses at Claremont for a year, simply dabbed her eyes with a paper towel and pursed her lips.Such was the bittersweet scene at the stable last week after the news spread that the only remaining public stable in Manhattan, which opened in 1892 and became a riding school in 1927, would close today.'"
"'07-04-29,'0','Cardinal Edward M. Egan feels that the finances of the Archdiocese of New York are his secret to keep — or to share only with those he calls “the best possible people.” But membership in the Catholic Church that Cardinal Egan serves is not limited to “the best possible people.”Money in the archdiocesan accounts is contributed by all of the church’s people, and the financial decisions made (from closing parishes to settling lawsuits) affect all of the church’s people.The “point” of public inspection of the archdiocesan financial records is to prevent scandalous cover-ups and payoffs. The point is to give grieving people the courtesy of a straight answer when they ask why their parishes must be closed.The point is to allow me — perhaps not one of “the best possible people,” but a baptized person nonetheless — to know what decisions are being made in my name, with my contribution.I don’t think I would have as much “fun” poring over the archdiocese’s records as Cardinal Egan suggests, but I would enjoy knowing that my church was protected from further mismanagement and corruption, and that my place in it was respected.'"
"'07-04-29,'0','Mr. Gurfein asked Mr. Breaux whether he could produce an absinthe that would pass regulatory muster with American authorities — meaning that it would not contain thujone. Mr. Breaux said that would be fairly easy, given his belief that, contrary to popular opinion, 19th century absinthes contained relatively little thujone to begin with — less than 5 parts per million, according to his tests, rather than much higher estimates that have been bandied about.Still, Mr. Breaux knew that removing thujone entirely might harm the taste. “I had to get a handle on the whole thujone issue without compromising the character and the flavor of the drink,” he said. To accomplish this, Mr. Breaux blended the grand wormwood with green anise and sweet fennel from Europe, instead of using more-affordable imports from East Asia. Using herbs from Europe, absinthe’s native continent, he said, gives the drink an earthier essence.Mr. Breaux also had to keep the American palate in mind while developing Lucid. “In the U.S., anise is a sort of a strange flavor,” he said. “We don’t get a lot of exposure to it.” So Mr. Breaux made sure that Lucid had a slightly cleaner, crisper taste than its European peers.Several Lucid prototypes were ready by last July; Mr. Gurfein and his staff at Viridian used an office taste test to select the formula they would take to market. That formula was then sent to the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau, a division of the Treasury Department, which checked the absinthe for traces of thujone and other impurities and approved it. The bureau also reviewed Lucid’s bottle, paying close attention to the words on the back.“They wanted to make sure that we were going to market this responsibly, that we didn’t intend to piggyback on some of the myths,” Mr. Gurfein said. Absinthe’s fabled reputation for causing hallucinations and madness has since been debunked.While Lucid was awaiting regulatory approval in the United States, Mr. Breaux kept busy perfecting the production process. He uses antique copper stills, which were not built for speed. Scaling up production by a factor of 100 over the prototyping phase, Mr. Breaux said, was a challenge, especially when it came to keeping the herbal flavor consistent from bottle to bottle.Lucid will be available starting next month, priced at $59.95 for a 750-milliliter bottle. A Web site, DrinkLucid.com, will soon post information on liquor stores that will carry the product.I sampled the 124-proof liqueur last week, while watching the National Basketball Association playoffs. When diluted with water and a pinch of sugar, the absinthe’s taste is strong and pleasant. And the buzz has an odd way of focusing the mind — I’ve rarely been so entranced by the swish of a basketball net.'"
"'07-04-29,'0','The flight was to last a day, a night and another day, whereupon I would reach Australia’s southwest shore. Were I a resident of the Antarctic peninsula, this would make for a sensible vacation spot. I am not, but my girlfriend has relatives who retired in the vicinity, and they were paying for the trip. If somebody offers to pay, I’ll go pretty much anywhere — Guantánamo, Los Angeles, Hell. Being a cheapskate isn’t all fun and games.My girlfriend and I boarded our new home gingerly. Because I am a gentleman, and also because I had lost a game of rock-paper-scissors, I had bequeathed the aisle seat to my girlfriend. This meant I would be flanked on one side by a loathsome stranger. My seatmate approached, a broad-shouldered man who smelled as if he woke up without time to shower because he had to wrestle a hog before leaving for the airport. I flashed him my best “like me — just don’t talk to me” smile and buried my nose in a book.As the plane began to taxi, I checked my cellphone one last time. Suddenly, the man turned to me.“You have reception!” he declared. “My phone is dead — can you send a text message for me?” I seized on this opportunity to ingratiate myself with the man, who would then spend the ensuing 32 hours owing me a favor. Magnanimously, I punched in his message informing his employer that he had boarded the flight. Then he gave me the phone number, which began with a 0 and ended somewhere near the outermost decimal places of pi. My face dropped.I had neglected to inform the man that I am a cheapskate. It’s just not the kind of thing you say right off the bat. “Hi, nice to meet you — I own special scissors with which I cut coupons.” Or, “Hello — when dinner companions order appetizers and drinks, I recoil, knowing that their gluttony is jacking up my tax and tip.” Now, nightmarish visions of my future cellphone bill flooded my mind.I apologized to the man, begging the limits of my paltry domestic phone plan, and was caught off guard when he persisted.“I can pay you!” he demanded. “I’ll give you $5!” Desperation dripped from the man’s every word, as if he were a teenager quarreling with her parents about a desired piece of denim. A flight attendant approached, warning me to switch off my phone; with seconds to spare, and no real alternative, I sent his message. A glow of heroism enveloped my body, and also a glow of wanting my $5.'"

"'07-04-29,'0','Other business owners in the county had a similar reaction after being notified of the disaster declaration at a meeting in Mamaroneck on Tuesday.“I’m not looking for low-interest loans,” said Frank Picone, owner of Picone Meat Specialties in Mamaroneck. “FEMA is missing the point. This was an act of God, and when it’s an act of God, they should help cover the losses.”Under the disaster declaration, individuals and households are eligible for up to $28,200 in financial aid related to loss of housing and property.Individuals may also be eligible for low-interest loans of up to $200,000 for structure damage and $40,000 on contents. The rate for those loans is as low as 2.875 percent, said Ed Conley, a spokesman for the Federal Emergency Management Agency.Mr. Picone estimated that he sustained about $750,000 in damages — including a piece of machinery that cost $150,000 and had been used for only three days — but his flood insurance would cover only about $250,000.“If I didn’t have good credit, I would be out of business,” he said.Mr. Conley noted that individuals who receive assistance from the federal government are asked to get flood insurance.Business and home owners who receive loans of more than $10,000, or are located in a 100-year flood plain, are required to obtain flood insurance.The emergency management agency has been encouraging residents and businesses to get flood insurance, particularly with hurricane season starting June 1 and another active season predicted. Mr. Conley said that every community in Westchester participates in the National Flood Insurance Program, which assures that such coverage is available. In addition, property owners who are not in flood-prone areas are encouraged to look for so-called preferred risk policies, which provide such coverage at reduced rates.But business owners in Mamaroneck say that flood insurance can be costly and that caps on the amount of coverage — in some cases $10,000 to $15,000 — can make it nearly worthless.Many business and property owners in Mamaroneck and other parts of the county called on local, state and federal officials to begin addressing drainage problems that were exposed in the storm this month and one on March 2. Several merchants at the meeting Tuesday in Mamaroneck also complained of sewage backups that occurred before the most recent flooding.Those seeking federal assistance can call 1-800-621-FEMA (1-800-621-3362) or go to fema.gov.In addition, village officials said, the United Way is serving as a clearinghouse for information and donations; residents can call 211 or (800) 899-1479, the number that cable phone customers must use.David Currie, the local director for the United Way in Westchester, said those in need could also go to St. Thomas Episcopal Church at 168 West Boston Post Road from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. tomorrow and Tuesday to meet with case workers.'"
"'07-04-29,'0','As the co-founder of Def Jam Recordings and the so-called C.E.O. of hip-hop, do you think the outrage over Don Imus’s prickly language and his firing might broaden into a crusade against song lyrics? It already has broadened to lyrics. It’s been that way since 1983. They’ve been yelling at me from Run-D.M.C. and the Beastie Boys till now.What do you make of Barack Obama, who recently said that rap musicians should reform their lyrics? What we need to reform is the conditions that create these lyrics. Obama needs to reform the conditions of poverty. I wish he really did raise his money on the Internet, like he said. I wish he really did raise his money independently.What are you saying? I think about one-fourth of his campaign contributions came from small donations made over the Internet, even though he collected more than any other Democratic candidate from Wall Street people. So at the end of the day, he’s controlled, too. That’s my point. He’s a mouse, too, like everybody else.Are there any presidential candidates who inspire you? I talk to John Edwards more than I talk to anyone. He has said more things about the conditions we need to think about. He went to yoga with me. He did the whole class, an hour and a half. He sweated like crazy. He’s in good shape, but it was hard on him.You write extensively about your devotion to yoga in your new self-help book, “Do You!” Is the title your own coinage? No. It’s an old hip-hop expression: “Do you!” It’s just something we say all the time. It means do what you want to do. Do what inspires you. Don’t be a sheep. Keep it real. The book was originally called “Russell Simmons’ Laws of Success.”'"
"'07-04-29,'0','Everyone at the company works 10 to 6. Matt Williams, who directs both Hogtied and the hard-hitting girl-on-girl wrestling site Ultimate Surrender, told me: “I like this because when eight hours are done, I’m done. I go home, and my job doesn’t follow me.” Williams used to shoot for a smaller, more sinister-seeming S-and-M site that is now shut down. He lives in the suburbs and has a child. “My wife and I watch ‘American Idol,’ ” he said, as if to show how average he is.It was a recurring theme. Patel acknowledged the image of pornographers as “a bunch of sleazy guys that are drunk all day.” “I probably had some of the same misconceptions,” she said. “But we have 401(k) plans.”A few weeks after Patel and I first spoke, Kink incited a minor media blitz by purchasing, for $14.5 million, the State Armory and Arsenal in San Francisco as its new offices and studios. The armory, which is on the National Register of Historic Places, is a 200,000-square-foot, brick, castlelike colossus in the Mission District. It had been abandoned by its only tenant, the National Guard, in the mid-’70s. After 30 years of disuse, its underground horse stables and ballroom; officers’ quarters, pool and banks of urinals; hockey-arena-like drill court with 70-foot ceilings and stadium seating — all of it — had attained a look of palatial depravity. It was the exact aesthetic Acworth and his directors had been struggling for so long to build from scratch. At the time the deed transferred in December, the basement pumps had shut off, and the creek that rushes through the armory subbasement had filled the old shooting range with several feet of water. Acworth was ecstatic. He imagined models waist-deep, with helmets and headlamps, or someone suspended over the waterline in a cage. “It could be very cinematic,” he told me.By early February, a fraction of the basement had been readied for a first official shoot. They were filming an update for the site Men In Pain. It would feature two players billed as Wild Bill and Claire Adams. Adams, who is 25, gave up on a philosophy degree to become a bondage rigger. (Last year, she tied up the actor Peter Sarsgaard for a bondage-themed spread in Vanity Fair.) She wore a fishnet top and a miniature barbell through each nipple.She laid her leather jacket over a concrete slab, and she and Bill sat down, nuzzling. Then she looked into the camera and, very cordially, spoke: “I’m Claire Adams.” “And I’m Wild Bill.” “And welcome to a very special Men In Pain update.” Just like that, like the opener of some fireside holiday special. They interviewed each other. She asked if there was anything she shouldn’t do, any ground rules. “I don’t like my ears being slapped,” he said.They started on an old stage in the armory gymnasium, rundown to the point of missing its floorboards entirely and gathering trash — a Coke case, a poster advertising youth boxing classes once held here — in the underpinnings. There, Wild Bill was tied to a column and flogged. (There are rarely story lines in Kink’s porn, and acting is discouraged.) His crotch was slapped. Later, in the boiler room, he would be kicked and suspended from the ceiling on his back, like a hairy spider. In between takes, after Wild Bill mentioned getting a little back pain, Adams would adjust the cat’s-cradle of ropes.Even as child, Acworth told me, he liked seeing people bound. “I would get an erection while watching a cowboy-and-Indian movie where somebody was getting tied up,” he said, “which I didn’t really understand.” For a long time, he experimented by tying up himself, alone; he was shy and didn’t have a girlfriend until his 20s. It seemed natural that when starting Kink, he would gear his company toward the subculture around consensual sex play involving bondage, discipline, domination, submission and sadomasochism — the B.D.S.M. community. It was a way to indulge his own fetish but also a shrewd business decision. With a bondage site, Acworth told me, he knew what the customer wanted.Initially, his instinct proved sound. But shortly after he moved to San Francisco to leap full time into the lavish free-for-all of online porn, Hogtied’s sales leveled off. Similar sites, often featuring the same licensed photographs, littered the Web. So Acworth started producing his own content in his spare bedroom. He would tether models to a homemade wooden scaffold, set up a tripod and film himself busily whipping, spanking and tickling them with various implements — all the while clicking still photos with a remote. He wore a black mask and called himself Peter Rogers in case he decided to abandon the stagnating business and return to Columbia.The ways online porn was created, marketed and sold were beginning to be reinvented. Or, rather, they were finally being properly invented. Even by 1999, search engines like Yahoo were harder to outsmart, and Acworth’s tricks for getting Hogtied ranked highly no longer worked. He followed the lead of bigger porn sites, recruiting vast networks of “affiliates” to lure traffic to Kink’s sites with smartly placed ads, galleries of free samples, spam or other means. The industry’s first affiliates were hobbyists, amateur connoisseurs collecting their favorite online porn in galleries or directing others toward it in newsgroups. Today it’s a competitive industry in its own right, with self-employed, stay-at-home entrepreneurs using a variety of increasingly sophisticated advertising tools. Companies like Kink or Naughty America — another prominent suite of porn sites with far more conventional content (errant secretaries, hair-twirling co-eds) — now work with invisible sales forces of tens of thousands of affiliates.But in those early years, with credit-card numbers circulating among unscrupulous Web masters and affiliates, various frauds proliferated. Prime among them was “credit-card banging,” whereby a person subscribing to one site might find he has been charged for a slew of others. For their part, customers found that they could easily repudiate charges they had authorized; Internet porn involved no physical delivery, and card companies, apt to take the nice suburban husband’s word over the pornographer’s, frequently issued chargebacks.Such headaches were not limited to porn. But porn was one of the few things being rampantly bought and sold online, and the financial sector, which hadn’t yet worked out a viable system for e-commerce, scrambled to develop one on the fly. Many banks and credit-card companies, including American Express, refused to deal with porn; others steadily introduced stiffer regulations and fees for high-risk industries. A site with more than 2.5 percent of its purchases charged back could be subject to closer oversight and penalties; eventually, its merchant account, and thus its ability to process credit cards, might be revoked. Soon, the standard allowable chargeback ratio lowered to 1 percent. Third-party billing companies stepped in to process the charges through their own merchant accounts, but they routinely take 15 percent or more of each transaction. (Paypal, which charged as little as 2.9 percent, ceased dealing with porn in 2002.) For the typical, sloppy amateur — the lackluster guy with a digital camera and some lady friends — billing suddenly became a nightmare. “And without billing, it just don’t work,” says Gary Kremen, who founded both the porn site Sex.com and the dating site Match.com in the mid-’90s. “Because what are you going to do, send money in the mail?”Kink has managed to retain its own merchant account, a rarity in the business. Acworth claims its chargebacks have always been minimal, in part because of the company’s own meticulousness but also, perhaps, because of the nature of its customers. “People that buy our content are people that are genuinely into the fetish,” he says. A B.D.S.M. enthusiast may spend hundreds or thousands of dollars a year on S-and-M paraphernalia or to attend fetish festivals like the Folsom Street Fair in San Francisco. “I think it probably tends to be a somewhat more refined clientele,” Acworth suggests. According to Scott Rabinowitz of Traffic Dude, an advertising consultant for the adult industry, high-quality niche sites have always been more profitable and attractive to affiliates. Narrowly targeted sites generally get a far higher percentage of their Web traffic subscribing. They also keep those customers longer; while most companies retain the average customer for less than three months, Rabinowitz suspects an average Kink subscriber stays at least three times as long. In fact, much of the industry has learned to be as specialized as Kink was from the start, with catch-all pornographic “megasites” making way for smaller, formulaic ones like My Friend’s Hot Mom or Chunky Angels. Meanwhile, Acworth’s second site was dedicated entirely to women having sex with large and distressingly elaborate machines. Another features water torture. Thus Kink seems to have survived all of these various shake-ups not only on Acworth’s business sense but his kinkiness.By now, real success and longevity online require both technological skill and a certain fiduciary seriousness. Acworth put Kink’s stellar benefits in place partly so he could steal top-flight people away from mainstream corporations. In the Bay Area, Rabinowitz says, the dot-com bust fed an entirely new class of talent into porn: “Middle-food-chain technical players could come over and create pivotal roles for themselves.”I met several dot-com era castoffs who were entrenched in Kink’s I.T. department and another, Paco Cohen, loading a crate of neatly cataloged riding crops and nipple pincers onto a truck the morning of the first armory shoot. Cohen, who was wearing blue-tinted glasses and a windbreaker with Colonel Sanders’s head embroidered on the breast, was a project manager for an AT&T affiliate in the area for four years. (“Baby-sitting for adults” is how he explained the job.) One day, he watched 700 people get laid off. Then he was told that his new boss was someone he had never heard of who worked in New Jersey. “I stayed there for two years just waiting to be laid off, and that was when I started hating it,” he said.Later that afternoon, waiting for Wild Bill to be fitted with a gag, Cohen told me that a disproportionate number of Kink employees, himself included, graduated from the University of California at Santa Cruz. “And that’s funny,” he said, because he felt the faculty there was trapped in a very 1970s, antiporn mind-set. Another, more recent Santa Cruz grad overheard our conversation and disagreed. The two debated it. Cohen told her that all of his professors had read way too much Andrea Dworkin. “Everything there is like a Marxist-feminist analysis,” he said dismissively.Soon, with Wild Bill tied to his column again, Adams coiled leather twine around his testicles and cinched it tautly to the back of a wooden chair, some feet away. She crouched and flicked him with her finger, hard. I saw Cohen turn away, wrenching his face in what looked like the empathetic cringe men make. But it wasn’t. He was yawning.Three days after the shoot, 60 Mission residents protested in front of the armory. While some gladly denounced the filth they had seen, or merely imagined, on Kink’s Web sites, the protesters as a whole seemed to believe, officially at least, that not being O.K. with porn was somehow politically incorrect.“We’re not making moral judgments against pornography,” one woman said over a megaphone as the rain started. Another assured me, “We’re not a bunch of conservative reactionaries.” They just didn’t want Kink in their neighborhood — not near several community-outreach centers and schools. Even Mayor Gavin Newsom’s office, in a statement sharing the neighbors’ general concerns, added the caveat, “While not wanting to be prudish. . . .”Their frustration stemmed from deeper issues. Roberto Hernández, a Mission native, told me that the neighborhood “has been a train wreck” since the spate of evictions, largely of Latinos, during the dot-com boom. Its problems are legion — drugs, prostitution, vandalism — especially in the shadow of the derelict armory. “We’ve made numerous attempts as a community to get something positive into the building,” Hernández said. (Neighbors also helped quash various proposals including one for luxury condos.) It seemed as if some in the beleaguered community had come to view the armory as a 200,000-square-foot storehouse of infinite promise. Now, regardless of how unfeasible turning it into affordable housing or a recreation center actually was, there was no chance at all. The previous owner sold it discreetly, without any neighborhood input.The protesters handed out placards. One read, “No Dead End Jobs,” and among Kink employees who heard about it the next day, this seemed to sting the most. Pamela O’Tey, one of two people in Kink’s accounting department, said that with her last employer, a large coffee corporation, she did auditing — period. “So I have to be appreciative of a company that is superwilling to teach you whatever you want to know,” she said. O’Tey hadn’t let Kink’s critics get to her. She understood their wariness; she has two young sons herself and is president of her P.T.A. “But today,” she told me later, “is the first day I felt like I might cry.”As the protesters began chanting, “Shut Them Down,” the staff of a youth-services center gathered under umbrellas. The Mission is working to keep its kids out of prostitution and away from violence, they said. Kink, which they saw as standing for both, would now negate that work. The sad thing, one woman told me, is that a job at Kink “is probably a better opportunity than we can offer them. I’m sure they pay good. I’m sure it’s not slave wages there.”While the rally continued, a few television crews were quietly lured through a side door to meet with Acworth. He looked anxious, silhouetted in the mammoth drill court. The instant he gleaned a reporter’s question, he would interrupt and, very hurriedly, sputter out the things he had been trying to communicate to his new neighbors: Kink’s impact could only be positive, he said. He would plant trees and light up the building, warding off the junkies and prostitutes; clean the graffiti and fix the windows; bring jobs to the city by renting the drill court as a sound stage for Hollywood films. As he frequently did, he invited any and all neighbors to visit the company and see what goes on there for themselves.Acworth wanted to be outside communicating with the protesters, not hiding in his fortress. “If my message is that I’m available, I should be out there,” he said again to his staff, who had discouraged it. He fidgeted. He turned to the last camera crew, packing its gear, and asked: “What do you guys think? Do you think I should go outside?” Everyone said no, politely. Acworth fidgeted some more.In a way, the armory, the titanic building itself, embodies the circumstances of porn these days: it is an exceedingly conspicuous presence in the community but also thoroughly sealed off and opaque. Kink could have tried to slip into the building innocuously, preserving that arrangement, yet Acworth seems bent on doing the opposite: he wants, very visibly and proactively, to be a good neighbor. (The week after the protest, he wrote an op-ed article for The San Francisco Chronicle, re-extending his open invitation to visitors.) Since the sale, he has been committed to making the armory’s two-foot-thick walls as transparent as possible — and B.D.S.M. along with it.While Acworth clearly enjoys retelling Kink’s materialistic creation myth — the fireman article, the laughably easy money — he also describes the company as having a certain social mission. Too often, he told me, B.D.S.M. is conflated with rape or abuse. He realized early on that building a respectable company devoted to the fetish could help “demystify” it. People who felt conflicted about their kinkiness, as he once had, “would realize they’re not alone and, in fact, that there’s a big world of people that are into this stuff and that it can be done in a safe and respectful way. Loving partners can do this to each other.” Kink’s required pre- and post-scene interviews, like the one I watched Wild Bill and Adams tape, for example, are meant to break the fourth wall, assuring audiences that, as in real-life B.D.S.M. play, everything is negotiated in advance and rooted in a certain etiquette and trust — that everyone is friends. The company actually requires that each model be shown smiling during the segments.Surprisingly, the commingling of pain and sex, the very core of Kink’s business, has long been unnerving within even the porn industry itself. For decades, the conventional wisdom among mainstream porn producers was that mixing the two, specifically showing bondage and intercourse simultaneously, might invite an obscenity prosecution. “People assumed that it was in the federal obscenity statute, that there was some specification about bondage and penetration,” says I. S. Levine, a k a Ernest Greene, longtime video director and screenwriter in the San Fernando Valley. “It just became one of these things everybody believed.” Bondage, he adds, was typically only shown in films without any visible penetration and sometimes hardly any nudity. Even Kink waited until 2005 before daring to show a man having intercourse with a bound woman.This self-imposed prohibition likely stemmed from the Meese Commission, the attorney general’s controversial report on pornography released in 1986. The commission determined that some women were forced to perform in porn — particularly “in the fringe areas of bondage [and] sadomasochism” — and questioned how people could know whether a given S-and-M scene was or wasn’t documenting actual rape. “Obviously we are not dealing with people that can act, so they can’t act the pain,” one law-enforcement agent testified. (Last month, a Brooklyn federal court found a man guilty of sex trafficking and forced labor when a female “slave” testified that S-and-M acts he filmed and posted online were not consensual.)Twenty years later, the subject of violent pornography’s effects on its audience is still debated. (Psychologists generally understand “violent pornography” as depictions of rape, coercion or some extreme imbalance of power; the term doesn’t specifically, or even necessarily, include B.D.S.M. porn.) Neil Malamuth, a U.C.L.A. psychologist, explains that the actual findings are nuanced enough to displease both sides of the political spectrum: heavy consumption of violent pornography is one of several risk factors that, working together, can increase the likelihood of sexual aggression in some men. The ambiguity of the research, according to Paul Cambria, an attorney who has represented the industry for 25 years, leaves pornography coupling sex to any depictions of violence potentially harder to defend.According to the United States Supreme Court, one measure of obscenity is whether an average adult in the community would deem it obscene. In the Reagan era, federal attorneys often had a video from a Southern California porn studio sent to places like Tulsa or Birmingham and prosecuted the company when it arrived. Thus they could lock in a far-more-conservative community standard than that of Los Angeles. But it has always been unclear what community standard applies to the Web. Moreover, while the Reagan administration fervidly prosecuted pornographers, the Internet sprung up smack in the middle of the Clinton years, a relatively tranquil time for legitimate adult businesses.Nevertheless, Levine says, the Web masters who first challenged the industry’s reticence about S-and-M weren’t seasoned pornographers accustomed to calculating such risks in the first place. They were “lifestylers” like Acworth and his directors, merely recreating what they saw all the time in underground clubs. “They set out to do what is natural to them,” Levine says, “and the roof didn’t fall in.”Acworth, in fact, seems to police his content simply by the values of the B.D.S.M. community, laboring to make its playful, consensual spirit transparent. Given the ultimate subjectivity of obscenity law, he told me, he can only rely on his own comfort level. Like many companies, Kink has also developed a list of “shooting rules.” It bars things Acworth finds distasteful or dangerous, including crying, urination, blood and needle play, “forcing models to put their heads down the toilet,” filming anyone who is drunk or high and electroshocks above the waist — except in certain cases, like when using “nipple clamps where the nipple completes the circuit.” Several industry people told me that Kink is known for treating its models courteously and professionally. “They are very ethical,” says Mark Spiegler, a porn talent manager, “which is not the norm in this business, either.”Though President George W. Bush signaled he would renew vigorous obscenity prosecutions, the Justice Department never got around to any significant crackdown. Fetish sites like Kink carried on confidently and grew. At the same time, an unprecedented volume of porn has spurred producers to distinguish themselves with more extreme content — and, as that becomes commoditized and omnipresent, still more extreme stuff. By now, even the biggest DVD companies have gradually followed the lead of sites like Kink into S-and-M-themed or other edgy content. Levine directed “Jenna Loves Pain,” an S-and-M film for one of the industry’s largest studios, starring Jenna Jameson, one of the world’s most famous porn stars. Its tagline: “Look Who’s Learning the Ropes.”Cambria, the attorney, says he sees pornographers of all stripes producing material now that they wouldn’t have touched eight or nine years ago. “Maybe many years with no consequences emboldened them,” he told me. “But it may very well have educated the public too, and that plays into the community-standard test.” The longer something is out in the open, and the more you see average people enjoying it, “the more you say, ‘Well, this is a part of America,’ ” he explained. “Familiarity leads to acceptance.”The porn business, in short, has a community standard of its own. What starts on the fringes works its way to the center. And this affects all of us since, more and more, the center of porn culture has converged with the fringes of popular culture. But Kink’s purchase of the armory represents a quirky quantum leap in the process Cambria describes: taking a real-life fetish traditionally relegated to underground clubs and the ethereal back channels of the Web and moving it directly into a brick-and-mortar landmark in the middle of a city — unabashedly, with the conviction that both it and porn can belong there.For those who feel that B.D.S.M. porn, or any porn, is toxic and reprehensible, the fact that at least some of it is being produced by thoughtful, educated young people might only be more troubling — a sign of how deep into respectable society it has reached. Then Cambria’s point would be more terrifying still: as such material stitches itself more tightly into the mainstream, through both its consumers and its producers, it strengthens its own legality. It makes itself unobscene.But Acworth, for his part, seems to find hope in some of the developments of the last decade, signs that some unfortunate misunderstandings are being righted. I asked him what he would think if one day he could walk into Wal-Mart and find racks of constrictive leather corsets. “I think it would be great,” he said. Though at that point, he added, in a world so awash with kinkiness: “I’ll probably stop making money. But I won’t mind that. A life goal will have been completed.”Early one morning in late February, a group of predominately Latino parents from a nearby elementary school and their principal arrived at the armory. They had taken Kink up on its offer of a tour.Mothers hoisted their strollers in teams of two as Lisset Barcellos, Kink’s longtime executive producer, invited them down the central staircase. Speaking in Spanish, Barcellos led them through the basement, refurbished considerably in the month since that first shoot. On the fourth floor, she took them past a freshly painted medical set with a table of surgical tools and gynecological chair. This is where crews keep their supplies, she explained at one point, opening a prop crate with a drawer marked “Vibrators/Insertables.” Acworth, looking as if he just woke up, darted ahead of the tour, switching on lights, trying to be helpful.Wild Bill and Claire Adams’s episode of Men in Pain would go online two days later. Kink was simultaneously opening several new sites and preparing an ambitious four-hour live feed of something called Device Bondage. (Its high-quality, streaming content would be lauded by the technology news site Cnet as an innovative way to stay ahead of the problem of piracy.) While opposition hadn’t died out in the Mission, the news coverage of it had, and the elementary-school group, for its part, seemed only faintly disgruntled, if at all. A few women asked to be warned the next time Kink had a party; the company had just been a host for 400 industry people, in town for the GayVN Awards, the so-called Oscars of gay porn. But someone also asked about holding school events in the armory.The tour ended in the drill court. An enormous parade-float-like vehicle — built by Kink’s in-house carpenters and metalworkers for a recent arts festival — was parked in a far corner. It was made to look like an old Western saloon, with cactuses, bar stools and an upright piano. A poster advertised Peter Acworth for sheriff.+Soon a dozen people had climbed onto the float, and Acworth took the driver’s seat. Suddenly he was piloting the women around the empty drill court in so many expansive loops — extremely fast, with a childlike impervious grin. After a while, he whirred his saloon to nearly the exact center of the arena. He parked. Behind him, the huddled mothers laughed. One, lowering her hips slightly, began to twirl her arm cavalierly over her head, as if working a lasso.'"
"'07-04-29,'0','Westerners who write novels about the third world have a difficult job these days. For one thing, they have to compete with third-world novelists writing authoritatively about their own countries. It is far harder to affect the jaded knowingness of Graham Greene when you're worried that Zakes Mda will let everyone know you're talking nonsense. At the same time, Western writers must still navigate the same old obstacles: the third world is full of things that have no common Western names, and an author can easily spend so much time explaining unfamiliar phenomena that the novel degenerates into a ""Lonely Planet"" guide with fake people in it.Daniel Mason's first novel, a Conradian odyssey through colonial Burma called ""The Piano Tuner,"" fell into that trap. It had an English protagonist, a beautiful Burmese translator who reveals herself to be a secret revolutionary and a Kurtz-like mad genius gone native, building a remote utopia based on the soothing powers of Bach. The new book, happily, throws out most of this exotic baggage, notably the Westerners. Instead, it treats the locals of its drought-ravaged third-world country as if they were Westerners — so successfully, in fact, that one wonders, early in the book, whether this nameless country is not some alternative-reality third-world Britain. ""A Far Country"" is a book about the world's poor, the several billion people who live as subsistence farmers or flee their land to scrabble for a living in the smog-choked megacities of the south. Its power lies in making the reader feel that, but for a bit of historical luck, its ""far country"" might be Britain, America or anywhere else.The book signals this intention from the start, in its handling of names: Catholic and vaguely Iberian, but rendered in English. The protagonist, Isabel, and her brother Isaias live in St. Michael in the Cane, a tiny hamlet near a dry river called Blackwater, where the farmers look forward to the festival of St. John. They grow sugarcane and manioc, but have been brought to the edge of starvation by repeated drought. The opening chapters establish the precariousness of this community, where a season without rain sends the men off to the coast or into the jungle in search of work in the ports or the gold mines. Historical memory goes back no more than two generations, the government and the law are alien forces, and rich men arrive bearing documents and guns, threatening to drive families off their miserable land.In this bleak environment, Isabel's family is her refuge. In particular, she shares a supernatural bond with Isaias, whom she can locate, even blindfolded, in the maze of the cane fields. This touch of Márquezian magic realism risks making the novel feel derivative, particularly as it is by now clear we are somewhere in Latin America. But Mason plays down Isabel's gift, treating it less as a marvel than as a medical condition; it illustrates her adulation of her brother, a rakish fiddle player and the lodestar of her life.The book turns on Isaias' decision to flee St. Michael in the Cane for ""the city,"" where he hopes to find work as a musician. With Isaias gone, Isabel slowly withers, until at last her family sends her to look for him. She lands in the shanty of a cousin, who needs her to care for her baby so she can pursue work as a maid in the city's wealthy high-rises. Baby in tow, Isabel sets out day after day into the vast metropolis seeking her brother, lost now as he never was in the cane fields.The simple plot allows Mason to sketch a rough geography of the third-world city: the extra-legal hillside shantytowns of the poor immigrants, plagued by gangs and attacked by the police; the boulevards and high-rises that amaze new arrivals from the countryside, provoking condescension from those who arrived a few years earlier; the trash mountains, picked over by the poorest of the poor; and the gated communities of the wealthy, where the poor go to work as servants. One narrative climax comes in such an apartment complex, where Isabel confronts a rich woman she believes knows something about Isaias. The woman is perhaps only as rich as the average reader, but to Isabel she may as well be Ivana Trump, and her disdain infuriates the normally placid Isabel — the first independent judgment she renders on her inequitable world.The arrival of the poor country bumpkin in the big city and the testing of filial affection against the cruelty of the industrializing economy have been myths of the modern age at least since Dickens. Mason's version has a more recent ancestor: ""Black Orpheus,"" the 1959 bossa nova film that set the Orpheus myth in the favelas above Rio de Janeiro. Many scenes recall the film strikingly, including one in the missing-persons bureau, where towers of dusty files drive home the hopelessness of Isabel's quest. The book errs in failing to update the surroundings; there are no dirty, obsolete PCs here, and one misses the bizarre multicultural fusions that cheap Internet cafes and pirated DVDs are creating in even the poorest societies. Perhaps Mason intends the setting to be the 1980s — a veiled reference to AIDS makes anything earlier unlikely — but that would rather blunt the book's immediacy.'"
"'07-04-29,'0','What if the Dog Eats It?Q. I consider the city’s Dial-a-Teacher program a great school resource. Since it involves children and telephones, I’m guessing that at least a few of the questions have been amusing, to say the least; any you can share?A. Amusing is the word. According to Amina Rachman, director of Dial-a-Teacher, the free homework help line sponsored by the United Federation of Teachers that began in New York in 1980, the very first call was from a kindergarten student who said, “I don’t have any homework, but could you tell me a story?”Here’s another one. “A call came in recently from two parents,” she said. “The call was not about homework but rather about their desire to become American citizens. They were studying for their citizenship test and had some questions about Congress.” The call was handled completely in Hebrew. Once the teacher pointed out that Congress was similar to the Knesset, things were much clearer.The most common calls are about math. “Students have a hard time when they have to tell us what math book they are using,” Ms. Rachman said. “Some funny results ensue: Houghton Mifflin becomes Muffin Mathematics.”Dial-a-Teacher’s number is (212) 777-3380. Calls are answered from 4 to 7 p.m. Mondays through Thursdays.'"
"'07-04-29,'0','“Many local governments take the point of view that they don’t want to ask that question,” Mr. Levy said. “I think it’s ridiculous for localities to call themselves sanctuaries.” He called the notion that some people would stop cooperating with the police “silly.”Mr. Levy said the federal government had promised to station immigration officers in two county jails, in Yaphank and Riverhead, to process undocumented criminals. And a recent local law will force businesses with county contracts to verify the status of all employees.LAST week in Westchester, County Executive Andrew J. Spano called a press conference asking for more federal resources to speed up deportation proceedings against an estimated 700 undocumented immigrants who are on probation.Mr. Spano said it costs the county about $2 million to $3 million a year to manage these probationers, who represent about 10 percent of the 7,000 people on probation. Of the 700 convictions, about 459 were for misdemeanors, officials said.Beyond the cost, Mr. Spano said public safety was at risk. “Having these individuals in our communities is a serious and ongoing threat to the safety of our residents,” he said. “Many of these people are serious, violent offenders, and I want them out of our communities and in federal detention centers now.”In the early 1900s, the growth in immigration was linked to an increase in crime rates. While recent polls have shown that there is a perception that the influx of illegal immigrants starting in the 1990s has driven up crime rates, several recent studies show that is not the case and, in fact, some sociologists believe the concentration of immigrants has kept the overall crime rate down in some communities.Dr. Ruben Rumbaut, a professor at the University of California at Irvine, who has studied incarceration rates of immigrants, said it was impossible to measure crime rates of immigrants directly, especially illegal immigrants. “The statistics aren’t collected that way,” he said.But Dr. Rumbaut said incarceration rates of immigrants versus native-born people seemed to indicate that immigrants get in much less trouble with the law. Comparing native and foreign-born men between the ages of 18 and 39, he said, shows that 3.5 percent of native-born men were in jail in 2000, compared with fewer than 1 percent of foreign-born men.“People come here to work and stay the heck out of trouble, away from the gaze of authorities,” he said.In Morristown, the police chief, Peter Demnitz, has taken issue with the mayor’s plan, saying, among other things, that he was worried that aligning officers with federal authorities might hurt cooperation between the police and parts of the community.After those comments, Mr. Cresitello ordered Mr. Demnitz to stop speaking with reporters. “He doesn’t have the scientific precepts to confirm that,” Mr. Cresitello said.Such a clash is not unique. “Communities across the country are debating what role, if any, their police should play in immigration policy,” said Michael Wishnie, a professor at Yale Law School who has represented organizations lobbying for the rights of undocumented immigrants. In many cases, he said, “the elected official asserts some kind of connection between crime and immigrants, and law enforcement folks are saying, ‘We have our hands full.’ ” Or in other cases, they say the community will lose trust in the police.Gene Voegtlin, legislative counsel of the International Association of Chiefs of Police, said more and more local police departments were considering the federal program, in part because it offers training in the complex field of immigration law; others are more skeptical. “There are those who feel it’s the proper role,” he said, “and those who think it has a chilling effect on immigrant communities in these towns.”In interviews, a handful of police officials talked about the fluid line between their duties and those of federal authorities, separate roles that blur or sharpen because of shifting politics and demographics. Local authorities are permitted but not required to check the immigration status of people they arrest, a process that starts with asking for identification, followed by sending a text message to a center run by Immigration and Customs Enforcement.The next step — detaining a person for illegal presence in the United States — now requires the participation of federal agents, and it is usually a civil violation, not a criminal one. There are fewer than 6,000 federal immigration agents, so advocates of giving local authorities limited immigration powers describe such partnerships as “force multipliers.”Cities and towns, along with their police departments, have come up with varied ways of dealing with issues that arise with an influx of immigrants.Some have taken a harder line. In Danbury, Conn., a raid in January by federal officers drew charges that local police officers had been involved. By contrast, places like Hightstown and New Haven have sought to reassure immigrants — documented or not — that cooperating with local authorities is safe and federal officers will not be alerted. In 2003, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York signed an executive order that promised that no immigrant would be arrested for immigration status alone.In Westchester, Rocco A. Pozzi, commissioner of probation and corrections, said that about 75 inmates out of the 1,550 now being held in the county jail are undocumented immigrants. He said the county was focusing on those 700 undocumented immigrants on probation whose cases have been reported to federal immigration officials, as part of the presentencing process.“This is not an issue to be confused about complaints around day laborers,” Mr. Pozzi said. “We are focusing on the people who are not only committing crimes but who have been convicted of crimes.”In Morristown, Mr. Cresitello said his thinking was animated by the violent killing of a 10-year-old boy, Walter Contreras Valenzuela, whose beaten body was found by the Whippany River in May 2001. A few weeks later, an undocumented 36-year-old Honduran immigrant, Porfirio Jimenez, was charged with his murder.Mr. Jimenez, who is still awaiting trial after various procedural delays, had been arrested by the Morristown police at least three times before Walter was killed, on charges including robbery and threatening a man with a knife.After the death of Walter, the son of Guatemalan immigrants, a candlelight vigil seemed to unify a town where the Hispanic population started growing in the 1980s. Now Spanish is spoken by more than a quarter of the town’s residents. Hispanic businesses line Speedwell Avenue, which leads to the Morristown Green, site of one of George Washington’s winter encampments and now a commercial center.Donations were made to the library in Walter’s name, and the police hired more Hispanics. Mr. Cresitello’s predecessor also hired an adviser for Hispanic affairs.Two weeks ago, there was another sort of candlelight vigil. As the Town Council discussed the mayor’s proposal, immigrants and their supporters gathered in protest on the steps outside town hall, saying the measure had sent fear throughout the Hispanic community.Inside, during a comment period, an eighth grader named Roel Flores-Pettiford walked slowly to a microphone and read a statement.“I was motivated to address you after hearing the concerns of my schoolmates, who are now afraid of cops,” she began, and presented a petition signed by about 20 of her classmates. The mayor’s plan, the petition said, “targets the Latino community of Morristown and instills fear in the children of this community.”Asked later about Roel’s speech, Mr. Cresitello said, “I admire her passion.”THE program the mayor wants to join is known as 287(g), for a section of the 1996 Immigration and Nationality Act that allows local officers, after being trained, to “identify, process, and when appropriate, detain immigration offenders they encounter during their regular, daily law-enforcement activity.”Seventeen law enforcement agencies have joined the program, and about 40 applications are pending. Field officers receive five weeks of training with immigration agents, including how to tap into immigration databases and process aliens for deportation proceedings.Some agencies have settled on a narrow focus. The Florida Department of Law Enforcement, which has trained 62 officers, limited their scope to “immigration issues with a domestic security nexus,” said Mark Zadra, an assistant commissioner with the agency.The department was one of the first to join the program, largely because so many Sept. 11 hijackers had passed through the state. Local officers participate in raids when they involve critical infrastructure, like airports, water treatment facilities and cargo ports. But Mr. Zadra said they do not look for undocumented workers in other places. “If you’re out picking tomatoes, we are not going to use our 287(g) authority to do a sweep of the fields,” Mr. Zadra said.But Don Hunter, the sheriff of Collier County, in southwest Florida, plans to apply on behalf of the county for a separate agreement with the immigration authorities. Sheriff Hunter blamed illegal immigration for many local crime problems, especially gang-related violence. Immigrant communities, including Haitians and Mexicans, already have strained relations with the police, he said, adding that he was not worried that closer cooperation between his officers and immigration agents would make things worse.“I haven’t had that experience of people not coming forward in the most heinous crimes, serious rapes, or a murder,” he said. “Our experience has been the reverse.”Officials from the Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or I.C.E., said this new program has helped extend its reach. “There is tremendous oversight in this program,” said Marcy Forman, who heads investigations for I.C.E., adding that the agency would rescind agreements with any law enforcement agency that did not manage the program properly.In New Haven, the police chief, Francisco Ortiz, said: “I don’t want officers on fishing expeditions. I want every citizen to be engaged.” The town adopted a policy of not asking about immigration status, unless officers are investigating crimes.“I have two undocumented individuals who are murder victims,” Chief Ortiz said. “You need people to tell you about the lives of the victims.” If his officers were also charged with enforcing immigration policy — no matter how small the role — witnesses would say, “You’re on your own,” the chief said.In many places, a reckoning on the role of the local police has centered on day laborers. Last November, a federal judge ruled against officials in Mamaroneck, N.Y., who had used checkpoints and ticketing to clear the town of day laborers. In Freehold, borough officials settled a three-year-old lawsuit by agreeing to stop fining laborers for seeking work in public.The mayor of Edison has been forced to navigate the tricky space between residents and authorities. Last year, during a protest by the town’s large South Asian community against alleged police misconduct, federal authorities arrested an Indian man who had argued with an Edison police officer. The man, Rajnikant Parikh, was deported last month. There have also been federal raids on illegal immigrants.Those raids “present challenges,” Mayor Jun H. Choi said. He added, “The focus for us as a local government is protecting our residents, and making sure there is greater trust, regardless of their background.”MR. CRESITELLO, in a series of interviews, stressed that Morristown was still early in the application process. (Federal officials say they have yet to receive its application.) But in any agreement, he would ask the federal government “to include language for people harboring illegals,” as a way to deal with the problem of immigrants living in cramped housing. “My position is that federal law defines those things as crimes.”He said the sight of day laborers in front of the train station was disturbing to the community, but added that nothing would happen to them “unless they were arrested in commission of a crime.” He added that he hoped contractors who hire undocumented workers would stop coming.To the police chief’s concern that immigrants would stop cooperating with local law enforcement — as they were asked to do after the young boy was killed in 2001 — Mr. Cresitello said: “We can force them to cooperate. They would be witnesses, not cooperating witnesses.”Michael Fabrizio, executive director of the Morristown Partnership, a business improvement group, said that for the most part the business community supported the mayor’s proposal, though there had been complaints. “He’s not anti-immigrant,” Mr. Fabrizio said of the mayor. “Without the immigrant community, we’d have no restaurants in Morristown. Isn’t there a way for them to come in legally?”A councilman who supported the mayor’s proposal, Dick Tighe, said: “We’re not going to be having jackbooted troopers out searching for illegal immigrants. We’re not going to be arresting jaywalkers.”Among those protesting the Morristown proposal on a recent Tuesday was Erick Carreto, 26, a day laborer who used to wait in front of the train station. He later worked as a busboy, learned English and now works for a nonprofit group that provides services to the laborers.He declined to talk in detail about his status, but said he was in the middle of the long process of “sorting it out.” Mr. Carreto said he left Guatemala as a teenager to seek work and is now able to send money back to his mother.The mayor’s proposal has made him fear random checks by the police, he said.Mr. Cresitello said, “I don’t agree that anyone should be fearful.” The mayor has argued in recent weeks with church leaders, after he said they were doing nothing to ease the hardships faced by immigrants. He also rejected a clergy proposal to build a center for the day laborers. Misinformation about his proposal, he said, has led to unnecessary hysteria in Morristown.“They don’t have anything to fear,” he said. “Unless they have something to fear.”'"

That data is copied by foreign companies which install it on the computers they manufacture.""The presumption that United States law governs domestically but does not rule the world applies with particular force in patent law,"" Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg wrote in the majority opinion.Neither Windows software nor a computer standing alone without Windows installed infringes AT&T's patent, Ginsburg added.U.S. patent law is inapplicable to the export of blueprints and there is no reason to think that Congress intended ""to place the information Microsoft dispatched from the United States in a separate category,"" Ginsburg wrote.The Bush administration supported Microsoft in the case.Microsoft and the Bush administration say computer code is not a component until it is copied onto a hard drive or installation disk.Copying parts abroad for assembly and sale abroad is properly the subject of foreign law, the Justice Department solicitor general's office told the court.In a separate unanimous ruling in this area, the justices said that a federal appeals court had gone too far in embracing a standard that has fueled an era of patent protection.The court said a federal appeals court applied the standard in a manner that is too narrow and too rigid.The case addresses one of the most basic issues in patent law: How to determine whether a product is obvious and therefore not worthy of a patent.""Granting patent protection to advances that would occur in the ordinary course without real innovation retards progress and may ... deprive prior inventions of their value,"" wrote Justice Anthony Kennedy.In the case of KSR International Co. v.

Critics of the test say it results in less competition and stifles innovation.

I don’t know why you have that doubt,” Mr. Silver replied with a sly grin. “My career is filled with conciliation.”And now, more entries from the legislative bad behavior blotter.For starters, there was Assemblyman Mike Cole’s admission last week that, after a night of drinking last month, he had slept on the floor of an Albany apartment where a 21-year-old female intern lived. The incident got the intern fired and landed Mr. Cole, 35, a Republican who represents parts of Erie and Niagara Counties, in front of the Assembly’s ethics committee.Mr. Cole said in the statement that he walked the woman home after a party on April 16 at an Albany sports bar. (The party was held by Assemblyman Sam Hoyt, a Democrat from Buffalo, in honor of Game 3 of the National Hockey League playoff series between the Buffalo Sabres and the New York Islanders.)“I ended up spending the night on her floor,” Mr. Cole said. “As wrong as it sounds now, at the time I didn’t think it was such a bad decision to sleep there, being that I was incapable of driving. But it was. I should have taken a cab home.”There are a number of well-documented incidents of improper behavior involving lawmakers and interns, and the Assembly now has policies restricting their social contact.“At no point in time did anything inappropriate occur, nor has anything been alleged,” said Mr. Cole, who appeared before the committee on Wednesday.The panel has not announced whether it will impose sanctions against Mr. Cole.Mr. Cole, who is married and has two daughters, is serving his first full term in the Assembly.Then there was Assemblyman Karim Camara, a Democrat from Brooklyn, who was stopped last week for driving 65 miles per hour in a 30 m.p.h. zone in Albany. He “was observed to have glassy/bloodshot eyes, slurred speech” and “a strong odor of alcoholic beverage on his breath,” according to a police report. Mr. Camara failed several field sobriety tests, but he refused a Breathalyzer test, the report said. He was charged with a speeding violation, operating a motor vehicle while intoxicated and refusing to take a breath test.Neither the governor nor the people in his ambitious political operation have made a secret of their designs on the Republican-led Senate, which holds a two-seat majority in the 62-member chamber. One of the targets in the 2008 election is Sen. Hugh T. Farley, a Republican from Schenectady, but their preferred candidate to replace him appears to be changing.Last week, Mr. Spitzer, left, speaking from the steps of the Schenectady City Hall, chided Mr. Farley for joining Senate Republicans in opposing the governor’s campaign finance reform plan. Notably absent during that speech was the city’s mayor, Brian U. Stratton, once the Democrats’ favorite to take on Mr. Farley. Party officials now prefer Assemblyman Paul D. Tonko of Amsterdam, who has represented the 105th District since 1983, because internal polls show him running more strongly than Mr. Stratton against Mr. Farley, said one person with knowledge of the Democrats’ deliberations.“I would acknowledge that paths can take many twists and turns, and I would not close my mind to any opportunity out there,” he said. “But I am happy with my service in the Assembly.”Translation: not ruling it out.Mr. Stratton said that Mr. Tonko “would make an outstanding senator,” but he said he would consider another run against Mr. Farley. In 2000, Mr. Stratton lost to Mr. Farley by more than 11,000 votes. DANNY HAKIM'"
"'07-04-30,'0','Improvements to the plaza area include a streamlining of the fountain and a broad new staircase entrance with a new underground roadway for car drop-offs. The goal is to make the campus more welcoming and accessible.The Lincoln Center development project has not been without complications. Last month, Jerry Hastings resigned as the project’s executive director after less than a year in the job, saying he wanted to pursue other opportunities. On Wednesday Lincoln Center named Ron Austin, a construction management specialist, to succeed him.And during the last year, the project’s total estimated cost has climbed to $900 million, including $650 million for the 65th Street sector, $190 million for the plaza area and $60 million in additional expenses.The increases bring the price closer to the $1.2 billion originally projected in 1999, a figure later disavowed by Lincoln Center officials as excessive.The cost has risen because of the addition of new public and performance spaces and because improvements to the Juilliard School and the updating of mechanical systems proved more extensive than expected, said Katherine G. Farley, chairwoman of the development project.Additions include a renovation of the Harmony Atrium, an indoor space that extends from Broadway to Columbus Avenue between 62nd and 63rd Streets, as a gathering spot before or after performances and a place to buy discount tickets. Lincoln Center Theater is considering a experimental stage that has also been factored into the budget.Many elements have yet to be resolved. Changes to the New York State Theater are back on the table now that the New York City Opera has decided to stay there at the urging of its new director, Gerard Mortier, rather than look for its own home. The opera has already opened discussions with the New York City Ballet, which shares the theater, about potential adjustments, said Reynold Levy, the president of Lincoln Center.A new stage for Avery Fisher Hall has been designed by Norman Foster, but is on hold until the 65th Street project is completed. Other unfinished designs include one for a garage on West 65th Street and another for a friendlier facade on the west side of Lincoln Center, long criticized for turning its back on Amsterdam Avenue.Lincoln Center is promoting several naming opportunities to help pay for the redevelopment. Already christened are the Starr auditorium and the Hauser patrons lounge. A new “Please Take Your Seat” campaign offers naming options for $5,000 to $10,000 a chair.The gala tonight, which also features Wynton Marsalis and Philip Glass, is to be broadcast on Thursday as part of PBS’s “Live From Lincoln Center” series. The event has raised more than $5 million, a record for a single Lincoln Center event, most of which will go toward the redevelopment.In the months ahead, Alice Tully’s regular performances will unfold on other stages. The Great Performers series, the Film Society’s New York Film Festival screenings and some of Juilliard’s concerts will be moved to Jazz at Lincoln Center’s Frederick P. Rose Hall at Columbus Circle. The Chamber Music Society will move most performances to the Society for Ethical Culture on Central Park West at 64th Street.Given a history of infighting among Lincoln Center’s various groups, which once threatened to jeopardize fund-raising prospects for the project, the mood seems relatively upbeat. “The news is good,” Mr. Bennack said. “This city and the movers and shakers in it have more awareness of what’s going on at Lincoln Center than at any time in my 30 years here.”'"
"'07-04-30,'0','How much sexual innuendo can an advertiser pack into 15 seconds?Pfizer, the world’s largest drug company, offers an answer in a new campaign for Viagra, so far shown only in Canada. The ads feature middle-aged men and women talking in a made-up language, save for one word.“Viagra spanglecheff?” says a man to a friend at a bowling alley.“Minky Viagra noni noni boo-boo plats!” the first man replies, with a grin that suggests he is not talking about the drug’s side effects. The ads end with the slogan, “The International Language of Viagra.”Pfizer has always straddled a line marketing Viagra, insisting that the drug treats a serious medical condition, impotence, and deserves insurance coverage, while promoting the drug with wink-and-a-nod ads that have irritated regulators.In 2004, the Food and Drug Administration told the company to stop running ads that included the lines, “Remember that guy who used to be called ‘Wild Thing’? The guy who wanted to spend the entire honeymoon indoors?”The ads come as Viagra is losing market share to other impotence drugs. Last year, Pfizer’s Viagra sales totaled $1.7 billion, including $800 million in the United States.'"
"'07-04-30,'0','The link to China has set off concerns among critics of the Food and Drug Administration that ingredients in pet food as well as human food, which are increasingly coming from abroad, are not being adequately screened.“They have fewer people inspecting product at the ports than ever before,” says Caroline Smith DeWaal, the director of food safety for the Center for Science in the Public Interest in Washington. “Until China gets programs in place to verify the safety of their products, they need to be inspected by U.S. inspectors. This open-door policy on food ingredients is an open invitation for an attack on the food supply, either intentional or unintentional.”Now, with evidence mounting that the tainted wheat gluten came from China, American regulators have been granted permission to visit the region to conduct inspections of food treatment facilities.The Food and Drug Administration has already banned imports of wheat gluten from China after it received more than 14,000 reports of pets believed to have been sickened by packaged food. And last week, the agency opened a criminal investigation in the case and searched the offices of at least one pet food supplier.The Department of Agriculture has also stepped in. On Thursday, the agency ordered more than 6,000 hogs to be quarantined or slaughtered after some of the pet food ingredients laced with melamine were accidentally sent to hog farms in eight states, including California.Scientists are now trying to determine whether melamine could be harmful to humans.The pet food case is also putting China’s agricultural exports under greater scrutiny because the country has had a terrible food safety record.In recent years, for instance, China’s food safety scandals have involved everything from fake baby milk formulas and soy sauce made from human hair to instances where cuttlefish were soaked in calligraphy ink to improve their color and eels were fed contraceptive pills to make them grow long and slim.For its part, Chinese officials dispute any suggestion that melamine from the country could have killed pets. But regulators here on Friday banned the use of melamine in vegetable proteins made for export or for use in domestic food supplies.Yet what is clear from visiting this region of northeast China is that for years melamine has been quietly mixed into Chinese animal feed and then sold to unsuspecting farmers as protein-rich pig, poultry and fish feed.Many animal feed operators here advertise on the Internet, seeking to purchase melamine scrap. The Xuzhou Anying Biologic Technology Development Company, one of the companies that American regulators named as having shipped melamine-tainted wheat gluten to the United States, had posted such a notice on the Internet last March.Here at the Shandong Mingshui Great Chemical Group factory, huge boiler vats are turning coal into melamine, which is then used to create plastics and fertilizer.But the leftover melamine scrap, golf ball-size chunks of white rock, is sometimes being sold to local agricultural entrepreneurs, who say they mix a powdered form of the scrap into animal feed to deceive those who raise animals into thinking they are buying feed that is high in protein.“It just saves money if you add melamine scrap,” said the manager of an animal feed factory here.Last Friday here in Zhangqiu, a fast-growing industrial city southeast of Beijing, two animal feed producers explained in great detail how they purchase low-grade wheat, corn, soybean or other proteins and then mix in small portions of nitrogen-rich melamine scrap, whose chemical properties help the feed register an inflated protein level.Melamine is the new scam of choice, they say, because urea — another nitrogen-rich chemical — is illegal for use in pig and poultry feed and can be easily detected in China as well as in the United States.“People use melamine scrap to boost nitrogen levels for the tests,” said the manager of the animal feed factory. “If you add it in small quantities, it won’t hurt the animals.”The manager, who works at a small animal feed operation here that consists of a handful of storage and mixing areas, said he has mixed melamine scrap into animal feed for years.He said he was not currently using melamine. But he then pulled out a plastic bag containing what he said was melamine powder and said he could dye it any color to match the right feed stock.He said that melamine used in pet food would probably not be harmful. “Pets are not like pigs or chickens,” he said casually, explaining that they can afford to eat less protein. “They don’t need to grow fast.”The resulting melamine-tainted feed would be weak in protein, he acknowledged, which means the feed is less nutritious.But, by using the melamine additive, the feed seller makes a heftier profit because melamine scrap is much cheaper than soy, wheat or corn protein.“It’s true you can make a lot more profit by putting melamine in,” said another animal feed seller here in Zhangqiu. “Melamine will cost you about $1.20 for each protein count per ton whereas real protein costs you about $6, so you can see the difference.”Feed producers who use melamine here say the tainted feed is often shipped to feed mills in the Yangtze River Delta, near Shanghai, or down to Guangdong Province, near Hong Kong. They also said they knew that some melamine-laced feed had been exported to other parts of Asia, including South Korea, North Korea, Indonesia and Thailand.Evidence is mounting that Chinese protein exports have been tainted with melamine and that its use in agricultural regions like this one is widespread. But the government has issued no recall of any food or feed product here in China.Indeed, few people outside the agriculture business know about the use of melamine scrap. The Chinese news media — which is strictly censored — has not reported much about the country’s ties to the pet food recall in the United States. And few in agriculture here do not see any harm in using melamine in small doses; they simply see it as cheating a little on protein, not harming animals or pets.As for the sale of melamine scrap, it is increasingly popular as a fake ingredient in feed, traders and workers here say.At the Hebei Haixing Insect Net Factory in nearby Hebei Province, which makes animal feed, a manager named Guo Qingyin said: “In the past melamine scrap was free, but the price has been going up in the past few years. Consumption of melamine scrap is probably bigger than that of urea in the animal feed industry now.”And so melamine producers like the ones here in Zhangqiu are busy.A man named Jing, who works in the sales department at the Shandong Mingshui Great Chemical Group factory here, said on Friday that prices have been rising, but he said that he had no idea how the company’s melamine scrap is used.“We have an auction for melamine scrap every three months,” he said. “I haven’t heard of it being added to animal feed. It’s not for animal feed.”'"
"'07-04-30,'0','Opposition politicians from the left and right have already called for the prime minister to resign. A recently formed protest movement, led by a former national security official, is organizing a rally around the slogan “You’ve failed; go home,” to take place in Tel Aviv on Thursday.The war followed Hezbollah’s seizure of two Israeli soldiers in a cross-border raid on July 12. The conflict lasted 34 days and claimed the lives of 160 Israelis — 119 soldiers and 41 civilians, according to officials. About 1,000 Lebanese, mostly civilians, are believed to have died in the fighting. Israel was not able to secure the soldiers’ release or to destroy Hezbollah.The interim report deals with the period leading up to the war and its early days, until July 17. That is when Mr. Olmert made a speech in Parliament declaring that Israel was at war. The Winograd Committee’s full report, dealing with rest of the war, is due this summer.According to what were said to be leaks published in the Israeli news media, the interim report will accuse Mr. Olmert of acting hastily and injudiciously and serving in effect as a rubber stamp for the army. Mr. Peretz will supposedly be criticized for failing to understand the magnitude of the problem posed by his lack of experience in security matters and for failing to seek professional counsel. General Halutz will reportedly be taken to task for silencing dissenting views, for taking advantage of Mr. Peretz’s lack of experience and for underestimating the strength of Hezbollah and the threat posed by its rockets.The spokesman for the Winograd Committee, Eli Shaked, would not confirm the veracity of the leaks, saying there was a “strict policy of not responding to unofficial leaks.”The committee went to great lengths to keep its findings secret before publication, including printing the report at the headquarters of Israel’s Shin Bet internal security agency.On Sunday, several politicians from the right-wing opposition parties called for the prime minister’s immediate resignation. Yossi Beilin, a lawmaker and the leader of the leftist Meretz Party, said that Mr. Olmert should not stay in his post “one more day” and that his “fate would be like that of Golda and her associates after the Yom Kippur war.”Mr. Beilin was referring to Golda Meir, the former prime minister, and her defense minister, Moshe Dayan, who were forced out of office because of public pressure in 1974, months after the end of the 1973 war. A state commission of inquiry, the Agranat Commission, headed by the president of the Supreme Court, had cleared both of any responsibility for the intelligence failure that led to the war, blaming the military instead.Another official state commission of inquiry, the Kahan Commission, examined the Sabra and Shatila massacres in Lebanon by a Christian militia in 1982. It determined that the defense minister at the time, Ariel Sharon, bore some responsibility for the events and recommended his dismissal. He was forced to resign as defense minister soon afterward.Because the Winograd Committee was appointed by the government rather than by the Supreme Court, some Israeli analysts have said it does not have the legal authority to make such decisive recommendations. The fate of the government will depend on the level of public protest and pressure after the report, the analysts said.Mr. Olmert has been weakened, in part, because he is facing numerous corruption investigations, including one involving his role in the sale of the government’s controlling share in a bank when he was finance minister.The rally scheduled for Thursday is being organized by Uzi Dayan, a former national security adviser and a nephew of Moshe Dayan. Mr. Dayan has formed a protest group known as the Civil Coalition made up of reservists, bereaved parents of soldiers who died in the war, representatives of border communities in the north and the south and various movements for clean government — including his own group, Tafnit, whose name means “turning point” in Hebrew.Speaking by telephone from his headquarters in Tel Aviv, Mr. Dayan said it was time “to let the people have their say.” Mr. Dayan said that there was no money for organized transportation to the rally, but he added that he was heartened by a call he said he received Saturday from Motti Ashkenazi, who wanted to join the struggle. In 1974, Mr. Ashkenazi, then a 33-year-old reservist, led the public protests against Mrs. Meir.'"
