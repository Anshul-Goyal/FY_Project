"'06-09-01,'1','WASHINGTON, Sept. 1 — The country’s missile defense system passed a crucial test today as an interceptor missile launched from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California picked off a target missile over the Pacific Ocean, the Pentagon announced. The exercise, the latest in a string of tests for the sometimes troubled missile defense, indicated that the interceptor’s motor system and its “kill” component both performed as they were meant to, Lt. Gen. Henry Obering 3d said.“I’m pleased to announce that the test that we executed today was a total success,” General Obering, the director of the Missile Defense Agency, said at a news briefing. “In fact, it exceeded even our primary objective on the test. And we also met all the secondary objectives of the test.”Asked for the chances that the fledgling missile defense system could shoot down an America-bound intercontinental ballistic missile from, say, North Korea, General Obering declined to offer a specific percentage number, saying such data was classified.Then, pressed to express the chances in layman’s terms from “excellent” to “poor,” he replied, “I think we’d have a good chance.” The prospects of success in a real combat situation cause him to “sleep a lot better at night,” he said.Today’s test involved an interceptor sent aloft at 1:39 p.m. Eastern time from Vandenberg and a “threat-representative” target sent up from Kodiak, Alaska, about 17 minutes earlier. In fact, General Obering said, data-collection was the main purpose of the test, and the interception of the target was a secondary objective.“Basically, what we did today is a huge step in terms of our systematic approach to continuing to field, continuing to deploy and continuing to develop a missile defense system for the United States, for our allies, our friends, our deployed forces around the world,” the general said.Today’s success must have been a source of relief as well as elation. The missile defense agency has conducted more than a dozen tests, with some of them ending in embarrassing failures, prompting critics to assert that the system would be ineffective in a real war situation. Each test typically costs $85 million or more.'"
"'06-09-01,'1','A summary of the top stories in Russian newspapers on Friday.PIRATES BEWARE: An amendment to the Russian law on intellectual property rights, which will regulate the practice of illegally downloading movies, books and music in Russia, becomes effective today. The amendment extends the intellectual property protections guaranteed for physical books, DVDs and CDs to their virtual counterparts, with infractions punishable with up to five years in prison. According to experts unnamed by the newspaper, counterfeit music makes up about 97 percent of the virtual market, while legal music downloads account for fewer than one million dollars a year.STATUE BOMBER SENTENCED: The leader of an alleged extremist group called the Revolutionary Military Council received a 19-year sentence on Thursday for blowing up a monument to Tsar Nicholas II outside Moscow and killing a businessman in the far eastern city of Vladivostok. By blowing up the monument, Igor Gubkin.said, he hoped to convince the government that his organization — which he described as a farce — was, in fact, real: in order to prevent the removal of the body of Vladimir I. Lenin from his mausoleum on Red Square. The newspaper gives no information on the murder charge.LUKASHENKO VERSUS DEADBEAT PARENTS: When Aleksandr G. Lukashenko’s advisors warned the Belarusian president that his plan to condemn negligent parents to a life of forced labor would draw criticism from the international community, he said he would “spit on the world.” Luckily, irresponsible parents can avoid this fate if they agree to pay for 100 percent of their child’s upbringing, which would be overseen by the state. The new plan will also simplify the procedure by which the state can take children from their parents.MARY MAGDALENE TO ARRIVE IN MOSCOW: The professed remains of Mary Magdalene, thought to retain the holy figure’s bodily warmth, will arrive in Moscow on Saturday and be on public view in the Cathedral of Christ the Savior until Sept. 13. According to the Orthodox Church, Jesus Christ cured Mary Magdalene of possession by demons. She was also the first to see the resurrected Christ. Her remains are usually kept on Mount Athos in Jerusalem.ALL HAIL VALENTINA THE GREAT! Unnamed sources have informed the newspaper that high-level government officials are exploring the possibility of designating St. Petersburg’s governor, Valentina Matvienko, to be President Vladimir V. Putin’s successor in 2008. The project, the newspaper says, even has a code name: Valentina the Great. If the newspaper’s sources are correct, then Ms. Matvienko proposed the idea to the president herself, promising to vacate the position after one term in office. The newspaper says that experts are sure the Russian people are not ready to accept as president a member of the “weaker sex.”AUTHORITIES OBJECT TO BESLAN PROTEST: The Moscow government has denied permission for human rights activists to hold a protest marking the second anniversary of the Beslan tragedy. Officially, Moscow authorities have forbidden any protest or rally to be held during Moscow’s City Day holiday this weekend. Svetlana Gannushkina of Civic Cooperation, a human rights organization, said that the city would rather celebrate than remember. “By their actions,” Ms. Gannushkina said, “city authorities are creating an atmosphere of apathy in society.”TEACHER, JOURNALISTS ARRESTED IN BELARUS: Belarusian militia on Thursday arrested a teacher, Ales Chigir, and twelve journalists after Mr. Chigir chained himself to a pole in the center of the town of Bobryuisk in protest over his recent firing. Representatives from the Belarus opposition believe that Mr. Chigir, who headed the local campaign headquarters of former opposition presidential candidate, Aleksandr Milinkevich, was fired for his political activities. The newspaper says that the Belarusian government is putting greater emphasis on ideological education in schools and universities and has developed a special ideological curriculum that has become an integral part of the country’s educational program.

"'06-09-01,'1','EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J., Aug. 31 — As the Giants and the New England Patriots conducted their glorified tryout for lower-level roster spots, there were two goals for first-team players on both sides: Stay healthy and try to end the preseason with some semblance of momentum.In the latter regard, the Giants appeared to lose.There were no serious injuries among the starters during the fourth and final preseason game Thursday night, although there was one heart-stopping scare. At the end of the game’s eighth play, Giants defensive end Michael Strahan was crumpled on the turf and required the aid of trainers on the field. The team later reported that he had been hit in the groin and that he would be fine.As for playing well in the final dress rehearsal for the regular-season opener against the Indianapolis Colts, 10 nights away, the starters did not overly impress the fans who speckled the inside of Giants Stadium. They played briefly, and not particularly well, in a game that the Giants ended up winning, 31-23. The victory capped a 4-0 preseason.“You’d like the first-team defense to stop the other guy and not let them score — it didn’t happen,” said Coach Tom Coughlin, who turned 60 on Thursday and did not seem overly concerned with the starting units. “And you’d like the first-team offense to take the ball and go somewhere — and that didn’t happen, either.”The first-team defense — minus the sore-kneed linebacker LaVar Arrington, who missed Tuesday’s practice, too — allowed a 14-play, 67-yard touchdown drive in its only action. The backup quarterback Matt Cassel led the Patriots, with the usual starter, Tom Brady, being rested.'"

Arnold Schwarzenegger, a Republican, joined with the state’s Democratic majority on the bill. The bill cleared its last legislative hurdle in the State Assembly in a 46-to-31 vote, with opposition from Republicans. The legislation increases pressure on Washington to place mandatory caps rather than the voluntary ones favored by President Bush.'"
"'06-09-01,'1','That language drew an immediate backlash from Democrats on Wednesday, and Mr. Bush did not adopt it. But he did echo the allusions to the failed strategy of trying to appease Nazi Germany. He called today’s terrorists ‘’successors to Fascists, to Nazis, to Communists and other totalitarians of the 20th century,’’ and cautioned Americans against concluding that five years after the Sept. 11 attacks the threat had receded.“That feeling,’’ he said, “is natural and comforting — and wrong.’’It was an aggressive opening salvo to the midterm election season, timed to coincide with the days preceding the fifth anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks. In forceful language, the president painted the war on terror as an epic struggle between good and evil.While he predicted victory, resurrecting a word he had dropped months ago and using it 12 times in a 44-minute speech, Mr. Bush also cautioned that the road ahead would be fraught with obstacles.But he put particular emphasis on what he said would be the consequences of a failure to ensure Iraq’s stability, saying, “If we give up the fight in the streets of Baghdad, we will face the terrorists in the streets of our own cities.”Telling his audience that the path to a stable and peaceful Middle East would be “uphill and uneven,” he invoked Thomas Jefferson, who said nations cannot move “from despotism to liberty in a featherbed.”Wiping a tear from his eye, Mr. Bush told the story of Cpl. Adam Galvez of Salt Lake City, a marine who was killed by a roadside bomb in Iraq and was buried Wednesday.Corporal Galvez’s parents attended the speech, which coupled familiar phrases about fighting terrorists “overseas so we do not have to face them here at home” with a fresh effort to lump various strains of Islamic extremism into what the president called “a worldwide network of radicals that use terror to kill those who stand in the way of their totalitarian ideology.’’Democrats said Mr. Bush’s strategy of painting them as weak on national security would not work this year and accused him of trying to divert attention from his record.“After six years,’’ said Representative Rahm Emanuel of Illinois, chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, “they’ve got only fear to sell.’’Another Democrat, Senator Barbara Boxer of California, called the Bush speech “a long repetition of old messages and rhetoric to scare the American people’’ and said she would push for a Senate vote calling on the president to replace Mr. Rumsfeld.“This latest Rumsfeld rampage cannot stand,’’ Ms. Boxer said.With Congressional Republicans fighting to hold on to their majorities in the House and the Senate, the speech came at a delicate time. Many of those lawmakers view the war as a political liability and have spent the past month at home getting an earful from voters.“Members of Congress are going to be returning next week, and they will be quite anxious because they will have been briefed by their pollsters, have spent the last three weeks with their constituents and most of them will be worried,’’ said Scott Reed, a Republican strategist. “So the administration is trying to set the terms of the debate to really make this a clear choice between moving forward and the cut-and-run crowd.’’Indeed, Mr. Bush’s speech made clear that he would make the issue central to his campaign on his fellow Republicans’ behalf. It reflected a belief at the White House that there is no option for the administration but to convince the nation that the struggle in Iraq is necessary and worth the cost in the service of a broader goal: eradicating the threat from Islamic extremists by bringing democracy to the Middle East.It also reflected a belief inside the White House that Republicans can once again convince voters that they can do a better job of protecting them than can Democrats.“Between ’04 and now, the Democrats have not only not provided a more united front, they are backsliding into a very irresponsible position of premature withdrawal from the fight in Iraq,’’ said Dan Bartlett, counselor to Mr. Bush. “Most Americans, I think, understand the consequences of that action, and I think that will prove to be difficult for the Democrats.’’Yet even some Republicans, granted anonymity to speak freely about their criticism of the White House strategy, were skeptical, saying the public was tired not only of the war but also of politically divisive speeches on national security.“The hard-core conservatives are already behind his Iraq policy,’’ said a senior Republican Senate aide. “For him to move the numbers in a way that benefits Congressional Republicans, he needs to reach out to moderates, and it’s difficult to do that when his surrogates are contradicting him and calling opponents of his policy appeasers.’’But Mr. Bartlett said the White House did not expect public opinion to change quickly.“The goal is not to see an immediate spike in poll numbers,’’ he said. “We’ve clearly understood that public sentiment doesn’t develop overnight. It’s been over a period of time, and it doesn’t change overnight.’’In making the case that the war in Iraq is “the central front in our fight against terrorism,’’ the president linked Iraq, the summer battles between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon and the growing nuclear threat in Iran under the general rubric of his freedom agenda.At the same time, he placed various factions of terrorists — Sunnis who swear allegiance to Al Qaeda, Shiite radicals who join groups like Hezbollah and so-called homegrown terrorists — under one umbrella.Experts said that might be overstating the facts.“ ‘Network of radicals’ suggests they are actually connected in some practical fashion, and that’s obviously not the case,’’ said Steven Simon, a State Department official in the administrations of President Bill Clinton and Mr. Bush’s father.But the comparison is central to Mr. Bush’s message, said Ken Mehlman, chairman of the National Republican Committee, who has played an integral role in developing Republican strategy for the midterm elections.“I thought linking together the different elements of this ideological movement was important to do, and was effective,’’ Mr. Mehlman said.'"

"'06-09-01,'1','“Everyone wants the underdog to win,” Williams said.This is quite a switch, Williams as underdog, but she seems to be savoring it. After yesterday’s match, she posed for cameras and lingered with fans. No longer can she adopt the against-the-world-attitude that used to be one of her signatures.Asked about the cheers, she said, “It definitely does make a difference.”Williams is going to need every source of energy to advance through a difficult draw. Even though she handled Hantuchova, who was seeded 17th, she did not appear to be in match shape. Hantuchova was generally successful when she had Williams on the run.Merely playing Hantuchova might have given Williams an extra push. Hantuchova tweaked Williams on Wednesday night, telling reporters about a match earlier in the month in Los Angeles, when Williams bumped her during a changeover.“She always does this,” Hantuchova said. “She just goes her way and expects everyone else to move.”Hantuchova and Williams have plenty of history. After she lost to Hantuchova in the third round of the Australian Open in January, Williams left the WTA Tour for six months because of a knee injury.The anticipated grudge match yesterday fell short of its billing, as Williams walked around the opposite side of the court from Hantuchova during the first changeover. In a brawl, Hantuchova would have had no chance. Williams is powerful and bulky, Hantuchova lean and agile.Fans used to complain that Williams was robotic, but her recent struggles have proven otherwise. After yesterday’s match, Williams compared herself with Andre Agassi, among the most popular performers in United States Open history.“He has a sense of fashion,” Williams said. “He’s a showman. At the same time, he has a tremendous amount of class.”Williams said the only player she would be worried about at this point is Roger Federer, who is obviously not in her bracket. But it is difficult to call her a contender just yet.Lindsay Davenport, seeded 10th, was far more impressive yesterday, notching the first 6-0, 6-0 victory at the Open since 2002. Davenport, who has complained recently about a sore upper arm, did not seem to suffer at all against Jelena Kostanic.“Trainers said they thought I had a different arm today,” Davenport said.If Williams’s underdog run at the United States Open falls short, fans could look to Aravane Rezai of France, who advanced to the third round with a 7-6 (3), 2-6, 6-4 victory against Lucie Safarova. Rezai, an immigrant from Iran, has no shoe or clothing sponsors.Rezai’s father and coach, Arsalan, was unable to get a visa to the United States, so she is being coached by her brother, Anouch. “I think my character comes from my father,” Rezai said. “My father has the same hunger to win and do something in life.”Williams has been criticized in the past for not having such desire. Even when she was the best player in women’s tennis, she was never the most popular. But now that she is nowhere near the best, her cause seems to be worth rooting for.'"
"'06-09-01,'1','SAN FRANCISCO, Aug. 31 — Executives from Intel, the largest chip maker, are expected to reveal on Tuesday the results of a sweeping evaluation of the company’s internal operations that could include layoffs of thousands of employees.The moves would be the culmination of what Paul S. Otellini, Intel’s chief executive, promised in April would be a broad review of operations to reduce costs and increase efficiency, after Intel’s announcement of disappointing financial results.Mr. Otellini told Intel employees in an e-mail message sent Thursday that he would announce the results of the study to workers via a company Webcast on Tuesday, according to an Intel employee who requested anonymity.Referring to Intel’s promise that it would announce results of the study by the end of September, Chuck Mulloy, a spokesman for Intel, said: “We said that we intend to disclose the results of the structure and efficiency study during the quarter and we’re on track to do that.” Mr. Mulloy declined to provide details or comment on the possibility of layoffs.In April, Mr. Otellini told a meeting of financial analysts that the company would restructure to focus on reducing manufacturing costs and identifying weak business units. “You will see a leaner, more agile and more efficient Intel,” Mr. Otellini told analysts at the time. Wall Street analysts have been eager to see Intel reduce costs, and most have expected Intel to announce layoffs this fall.Nathan Brookwood, a technology consultant, said he expected Intel to reduce its work force drastically, perhaps by eliminating redundant projects.'"

"'06-09-01,'1','Orders of protection are not unusual in New York courts, but one issued yesterday by a Queens judge to protect a 5-year-old is believed to be the first of its kind, according to an animal society special agent.The 5-year-old is a dog, Bebe, a bichon frisé from Lindenwood.The order, signed by Judge Alex J. Zigman of Queens Civil Court, says that Frederick Fontanez, 20, a friend of Bebe’s owner, Derek Lopez, must maintain a distance of at least 100 yards from both the dog and Mr. Lopez.“Very often, abusers use animals to get at the people they are abusing and animals get caught in the middle,” said the special agent, Joseph Pentangelo of the law enforcement department of the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. “They know that the pet might be dear to the person they are abusing.”The order is believed to be the first of its kind under legislation signed by Gov. George E. Pataki in July extending court orders of protection to pets in abusive households. Part of the legislation’s aim is to promote awareness that the reach of domestic violence often extends to pets.Investigators said Mr. Lopez has not indicated that he himself was beaten, although Bebe’s injuries were consistent with abuse.Early on July 20, Mr. Lopez left for work, leaving Bebe alone in his apartment in Lindenwood with Mr. Fontanez, according to a criminal complaint. The two men quarreled that day, investigators said.When Mr. Lopez returned that evening, he found that Bebe cried when he touched him, and had extensive bruises on his back, thigh and eye, the complaint said. A neighbor later reported hearing a commotion and Bebe’s cries that afternoon.'"
"'06-09-01,'1','Mel A. Sachs, for decades a colorful fixture of the New York City courts, who was known not only for his famous clients but also for his trademark bow ties, grandiose trial oratory and penchant for performing magic tricks before juries, died on Wednesday in Manhattan. He was 60. The cause was pancreatic cancer, according to his brother, Joel H. Sachs.Mel Sachs affected the dapper look of an English barrister, but his clients wore collars ranging from white to blue to no, and they ranged from the notorious to the famous to the thoroughly obscure. They included the rappers Lil’ Kim and Ludacris, the music impresario Russell Simmons, the boxer Mike Tyson, the art dealer Alec Wildenstein and the New York Yankees David Wells and Derek Jeter.Recently, he represented Lillo Brancato Jr., the actor on “The Sopranos” who is charged with murder in the killing of a police officer. Mr. Sachs was also counsel for a rainbow-ish roster of organizations ranging from the Congress of Racial Equality to the Shomrim Society of the New York City Police Department, a group of Jewish officers.In representing clients in both criminal and civil cases, Mr. Sachs found zero contradiction in taking the side of both guardians and disruptors of the peace: his clients included not only the Port Authority Police Benevolent Association and the New York State Parole Officers’ Association, but also Sante and Kenneth Kimes, the mother-and-son murderers of an Upper East Side widow, and Alejandro Henriquez, a livery-cab driver who killed a 21-year-old woman and two girls.The actor Sean Penn studied Mr. Sachs to prepare for his role as David Kleinfeld, the natty criminal lawyer in the 1993 film “Carlito’s Way,” an adaptation of crime novels by Edwin Torres, a State Supreme Court justice. Justice Torres sent the actor to Mr. Sachs because “I wanted Sean to see what a real lawyer does,” he said later.'"
"'06-09-01,'1','Like many of his peers, Hincapie sympathized with riders who had been penalized for actual or suspected use of performance-enhancing drugs. He said no other riders had told him they were taking banned drugs. But one former rider, Jonathan Vaughters of Denver, now a team director, said he knew riders who did take them.“I never wanted to make a moral judgment because you’ve got to understand why guys do it,” Vaughters said. “Most of them weren’t looking to win races or gain an advantage. They wanted to be competitive and keep their jobs. They didn’t want to get fired. You can’t condemn someone for that.”The best-known riders racing here are Hincapie, Levi Leipheimer, Dave Zabriskie and Jason McCartney, all with international credentials. Before leaving home in Santa Rosa, Calif., to fly here, Leipheimer, 32, said by telephone that the drug incidents could help cycling.“It’s hurt the sport, definitely, but in the long run I think it can be very good, because the sport can go a long way in the fight against doping,” he said. “We’ve had a lot of problems, but we also go after doping most aggressively. I don’t know if you can say that about other sports. In Madrid, the police said 200 sports people were involved in drugs. They said 50 or 60 were cyclists, but they didn’t identify any other sports.”“It’s crossed my mind that some people associate all cyclists with what has happened,” he said. “That’s no different from being racist or otherwise prejudiced.”Elite cyclists are generally defensive about their sport and its ills.“It’s a bad rap,” said Zabriskie, 27, of Salt Lake City. “That’s nothing new. I think many sports have problems but keep them a little more private.”McCartney, 32, of Iowa City, said he was tested 12 to 16 times last year. In Europe, he said, there are daily blood tests in the morning before a race, with 40 to 50 riders tested before a one-day race and two or three teams tested during a major tour.“It’s random, so if they test you today, they can test you tomorrow, too,” he said. “It’s all tough on the sport and tough on the sponsors, but in the long run we should have a better, cleaner sport.”Hincapie’s next-door neighbor is Craig Lewis, 21, the national under-23 road-race champion. They train together, and Lewis said he had learned much about life from his mentor.“I’ve grown up with all these drug scandals,” Lewis said. “It’s not worth the risk. It can ruin your whole life. You can lose your job. I think we can turn the negative of drug abuse into a positive.”Leipheimer said he hoped so, and not only for cycling, but also for the world at large.“Will this drug stuff stop?” he said. “Hopefully, it will, but will everyone in society stop taking drugs? I don’t see a difference.”'"
"'06-09-01,'1','Days before the fifth anniversary of the terror attack on the World Trade Center, New York City health officials yesterday started mailing to every doctor in the city the first formal set of clinical guidelines to diagnose and treat physical and mental health problems related to the disaster.The city had been sharply criticized by medical experts and labor leaders for declining to issue the guidelines in late 2001 when the first health problems started to arise, and in subsequent years.Experts have said that lacking a formal advisory from the city, doctors may not have had sufficient information to recognize the ailments connected to 9/11, or to prescribe the proper treatment.“It’s about time these were mailed to every doctor in the city,” said Representative Carolyn B. Maloney, a Manhattan Democrat who has been critical of the city’s health response to 9/11. “My only question is: why has it taken five years?”Dr. Thomas R. Frieden, commissioner of the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, said the city had been hesitant to issue guidelines until it had sufficient scientific evidence linking the dust to serious and persistent illnesses.'"
"'06-09-01,'1','A lethal form of budgetary politics is at work in Congress. The proven formula for assisting AIDS-ridden urban areas that pioneered effective treatment programs is in danger of being radically altered to shift money to more rural states. Rather than increase spending to cover both real priorities — the cities’ AIDS needs and the growing problem of H.I.V. in rural areas — current proposals would deny the cities tens of millions of dollars.Nothing could be more foolhardy for the nation as a whole. The AIDS battle knows no boundaries and has hardly waned in New York, California, Florida, Illinois and the other states that first confronted the challenge a generation ago. The cuts being contemplated would be traumatic for the valuable mix of treatments now given to tens of thousands.The Republican leadership hopes to rush this change through Congress soon after it returns next week in the renewal of the $2 billion AIDS spending program. A fairer formula is being sought by alarmed lawmakers from the states slated to be shortchanged. Republicans are trying to spread nonsense that this all about red state versus blue state. The real question is whether Congress would dare to turn the proven Comprehensive AIDS Resources Emergency Act into another demeaning pork-barrel competition. In effect, the potential urban losers stand to be penalized for having shown the way in fighting the AIDS scourge.Lawmakers have been on a generous recess in which they drove spending for their own re-election lifelines to $300 million for television alone. It will take a relative pittance — perhaps $100 million more — to finance the AIDS fight across the board. Surely a Congress that repeatedly spends far more on favored pieces of hometown pork can find the wherewithal to see to this life-and-death issue for the entire nation.'"
"'06-09-01,'1','In an interview, Tom Robbins, a longtime reporter and union steward at The Voice, said: “We’ve been looking forward to this new editor coming on and then all of a sudden we get hit with these very deep cuts and firings, including people like Bob Christgau, who helped put The Voice on the map. It cuts the heart right out of the paper.”Reached by telephone yesterday, Mr. Blum said the decisions to lay off the eight employees, including the theater editor Jorge Morales and the dance editor Elizabeth Zimmer, “were made by Village Voice Media before I was hired.” He added that because he was not assuming his duties until Sept. 12, “it wouldn’t have been appropriate for me to weigh in on these decisions before I even took over the job.”Since New Times Media took over the paper, Voice staff members have feared that the new management intended to centralize arts coverage and use writers and editors from various Voice Media papers to fill the local pages.Mr. Blum said “no one has said anything to me about the arts coverage emanating from anywhere but from within The Voice and its staff and its writers, and that’s how I plan to do it.”He added, “Having said that, I welcome the input of Michael Lacey and the parent company because I think they put out terrific newspapers and are journalists who are committed to the same type of coverage that I am.”Ed Park, a senior editor in charge of the books section who said he learned by telephone on Wednesday that he was being let go, said he was “shocked and insulted” by the firings. But, he said, “I could see that this was coming,” in part because of talk of centralized arts coverage. He added that Village Voice management had an “attitude of disdain for what I thought were the strong points of The Voice. It was a swaggering attitude that their chain of papers were so good and The Voice was an embarrassment and we have to get up to their level somehow.”In addition to the five senior editors in charge of arts coverage, The Voice also laid off three members of its design staff, including Minh Uong, the art director.In its statement yesterday, Village Voice Media management said that the company had “already increased its arts coverage,” citing an expanded calendar selection, the hiring of a staff film reviewer and “a larger theater section that features more reviews,” despite the fact that it had laid off Mr. Morales, the theater editor.Mr. Christgau, 64, who noted that he had forged the paper’s style of music criticism, with its “serious consideration of popular music at a critical level,” said in a phone interview that before he learned he had lost his job, he had begun organizing the paper’s Christmas consumer review.“I was really thinking about what I was going to do. I wasn’t planning on going anywhere,” he said. “I was doing my job.”'"

MySpace could be that alternative.”In the last year, MySpace.com has become the most-visited Internet address among Web users in the United States, according to Hitwise, which monitors Web traffic, with mainly teenagers and young adults using the site to socialize and to share music and photographs.By the end of the year, Mr. DeWolfe said, MySpace will offer independent bands that have not signed with a record label a chance to sell their music on the site.

"'06-09-02,'0','Decoys involve relatively basic technology that a potential foe like North Korea could be expected to employ, said Stephen Young, a missile defense specialist with the Union of Concerned Scientists, which opposes deployments of missile defenses.“This test was as scripted as it can be,” he said. “It’s a very complicated test, technically, but it’s much simpler than dealing with an actual missile launch would be.” In a real-life attack, he said, far less would be known about the timing, trajectory and characteristics of an incoming warhead.Countermeasures might be used in the next test of the system, planned for later this year, General Obering said. He added that the target’s speed, size and other characteristics resembled those of a North Korean long-range missile, called the Taepodong 2. North Korea test-fired one of the missiles in July, but it failed or was aborted shortly after launching and fell into the Sea of Japan.In Friday’s test, the interceptor missile launched at 1:39 p.m. Eastern time from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California, one of two interceptor sites in the United States. The launching came about 17 minutes after the target missile was sent up from a military installation in Kodiak, Alaska.Tamping down expectations, officials had been saying that the goal of the test was not necessarily to strike the target but only to gather data on whether the so-called kill vehicle, which separates from the interceptor in space, would recognize the warhead and maneuver toward it.That enabled General Obering to say that the test had exceeded the objectives when the missile intercepted the target. “What we are trying to do is under-promise and over-deliver,” he said. Data from the test would be used to make further improvements in the system and to design additional tests, he added.Asked for the chances that the fledgling missile defense system could shoot down an America-bound intercontinental ballistic missile from North Korea, General Obering declined to offer a specific percentage number, saying such information was classified. Pressed to rate the chances from “excellent” to “poor,” he replied, “I think we’d have a good chance.”Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld, who said earlier this week that he wanted to see a successful full-scale test of the system before declaring whether he had confidence that it would work, said in a statement that the results vindicated the Bush administration’s decision to make the system operational while continuing to test it.“Successful tests such as these increase confidence in the approach to developing an initial missile defense capability,” he said. ""While today’s test was a success, the test program is by no means complete. Tests will continue, some of which will be successful and some will not.”The test on Friday is the latest chapter in the long-running saga of the United States missile defense program, which began with President Reagan’s expansive vision of a space-based antimissile shield.More than 20 years and billions of dollars later, the Bush administration is proceeding with a limited antimissile system that is designed to counter prospective dangers from nations like North Korea and Iran that might eventually be able to launch, at most, a small barrage of missiles.President Bush made the program a top priority soon after taking office and cleared the way for antimissile deployments by withdrawing from the Antiballistic Missile Treaty with Russia. The White House decision to move ahead with the system before finishing testing meant that two interceptors sites, one at Vandenberg and one at Fort Greely, Alaska, are already operating, while testing continues.An interceptor consists of a rocket that carries a 155-pound “kill vehicle,’’ which is designed to seek out and collide with an enemy missile warhead. Friday’s test was the first time an interceptor had been fired from one of the two operating sites. In past launchings, the tests had been conducted at Kwajalein Atoll in the Marshall Islands.'"
"'06-09-02,'0','Robert B. MacIntosh, chief economist at the fund manager Eaton Vance, is among those not expecting seasonal weakness. The looming end of Fed tightening encourages him, and the prospect of stagnation in Washington leads him to think the off-year election curse may not hold.“If the Republicans look as though they are going to lose one or two houses of Congress, that means gridlock, and the markets have tended to like gridlock,” he explained. “The Fed, coupled with election season, makes me think it’s going to be different this fall.”Tobias Levkovich, chief United States equity strategist at Citigroup Investment Research, said in a report to clients that stocks might move lower at the start of the month, confirming the historical pattern, but that the picture might then brighten.He tracks investor sentiment with an indicator he calls the Panic/Euphoria Model. It falls as investor gloom increases, and lower readings tend to foretell higher share prices.THE model has declined for several months and stands close to a two-decade low. By Mr. Levkovich’s reckoning, there is a 90 percent chance that stocks will be higher six months from now.He also said valuations are in a “sweet spot,” a price-earnings multiple for the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index of about 15; in the past, that has preceded strong returns.There is a broad consensus that stocks appear more attractively priced than a year ago, but other advisers find the spot less sweet than Mr. Levkovich does. They remind investors that valuations that seem cheap may turn out not to be.James Stack, editor of the InvesTech Market Analyst newsletter, cited numerous formulas — comparing share prices with dividend yields and earnings, or price-earnings ratios with bond yields — that show valuations at close to their lowest levels in up to 25 years. But Mr. Stack warns his subscribers that they are “navigating treacherous waters.”He described the economy as being “on a collision course with a recession.” Reasonable valuations may make the losses he anticipates for stocks reasonable, too; he pointed out that bear markets since the 1930’s that began when P.E. ratios were less than 17 have typically produced losses of around 20 percent, while bear runs afflicting more overvalued markets have often run up losses of 30 percent to 50 percent. Either way, he advises holding high cash positions.Pete Kendall, co-editor of The Elliott Wave Financial Forecast newsletter, is a longstanding bear. He says valuations and sentiment must fall further before he will feel comfortable buying stocks again.He sees little cause to put faith in seasonal patterns — except for their long history of success. “Seasonals can be somewhat annoying because they are such darn simplistic reasons for being bearish or bullish, and yet they seem to work more times than not,” he said. The autumn swoon “is certainly one of them.”Mr. Kendall expects the market to conform to the pattern this year — up to a point. “If there is a surprise this time,” he said, “we think it will be that even though it is another rough two-month stretch for stocks, October fails to mark a low.”'"
"'06-09-02,'0','A company spokesman disputed the reports of further slippage, saying that the company was still aiming to meet the November and January goals.Because most large corporations may wait as long as 18 months before deploying the program widely to employees, a relatively short further delay is unlikely to have a significant revenue impact on Microsoft.“Corporate adoption will be relatively slow,” said Roger L. Kay, president of Endpoint Technologies Associates, a computer industry consulting firm. “It could be 2008 before many companies actually deploy in volume.”Over the summer, Vista has been tested by several million developers and ordinary users and has received less than stellar marks. Complaints have ranged from repeated crashes to an irritating user interface that constantly force users to click on warning boxes.A recent version being used by a smaller group of technical experts has been given much higher marks for stability and for using less computer memory.Friday’s version, called Release Candidate 1, or RC1, is a crucial last trial needed to tell the company whether it is on track.“This is supercritical for us,” said Sven Hallauer, director of release management for Windows Vista, during an internal interview that was posted Friday on a company Web site. “We have our own criteria for quality to ship, but we really need the validation from the community.”Time is particularly tight, he said, because the company has only two or three weeks after Friday’s release to make significant changes, after which the project will grow increasingly constrained.“Teams are working superhard right now,” he said in the interview. “Teams are working 50, 60, 70 hours a week to go ship this RC1 milestone.”In an e-mail message sent to testers Friday, Jim Allchin, co-president of Microsoft’s platform and services division, wrote: “The operating system is in great shape with RC1, but there’s still a lot of testing to do. You’ve come through for us so far, and I’m asking you to once again put the pedal to the metal and send us feedback.”Analysts said that while the company has made progress, there could still be land mines that could throw the effort into disarray.“They are never out of the woods until the product is delivered,” said Al Gillen, research director for system software at the International Data Corporation, a market research firm based in Framingham, Mass.This week, Microsoft declined to comment after pricing information appeared on Amazon.com. The prices, which ranged from $199 for a basic home version to $399 for the all-in-one Windows Vista Ultimate, will potentially increase Microsoft’s earnings next year, according to Rick Sherlund, a Goldman Sachs financial analyst.In a research note, he also cautioned that the significant hardware requirements for the new operating system might limit the rate of adoption for the software.Vista will have an array of new features and changes in appearance from Microsoft’s current operating system, Windows XP. Superfetch, for example, lets Vista monitor the applications most frequently used and places them in memory so that they will appear to load more quickly.In the interview posted by Microsoft, Mr. Hallauer said Vista would have fewer dreaded “blue screens of death,” in which the operating system freezes and leaves the user with a blue display screen. Instead, Vista will automatically recover from such freezes and start over, without forcing the user to restart the system manually.'"
"'06-09-02,'0','TRAVELERS REST, S.C., Sept. 1 — The record books will show that Dave Zabriskie won USA Cycling’s first professional time-trial national championship Friday. In reality, Chris Baldwin lost the race.Baldwin had less than a quarter-mile left on the 20.13-mile course, and it looked as if he was going to win by about 11 seconds. But Baldwin crashed on a sharp turn, and by the time he could get going again, he had lost too much time.The time trial, on an overcast 78-degree morning, went from one gated community of suburban Greenville to another. The rolling course was especially difficult in the last two miles, which included a number of sharp turns.Zabriskie finished in 41 minutes 49.69 seconds, an average of 28.53 miles an hour. Baldwin was second in 42:21.56, but he was faster than Zabriskie until Baldwin misjudged the last turn.A half-hour later, Baldwin was smiling and at ease.“It was a 90-degree right turn, a very hard turn,” he said. “On the three turns before that, I scrubbed off a lot of speed. They were sweepers. I kind of got in the mode that these turns aren’t sharp. I thought I could cruise the last turn, and I went straight instead of turning.”'"
"'06-09-02,'0','About a dozen researchers produced the new study over the last two months by assembling material from the longer report that addressed the conspiracy claims.“With the fifth anniversary coming up, there seemed to be more play for the alternative viewpoints,” said Michael E. Newman, a spokesman for the institute. “We have received e-mails and phone calls asking us to respond to these theories, and we felt that this fact sheet was the best means of doing so.”A nationwide poll taken earlier this summer by the Scripps Survey Research Center at Ohio University found that more than a third of those surveyed said the federal government either took part in the attacks or allowed them to happen. And 16 percent said the destruction of the trade center was aided by explosives hidden in the buildings. The survey questioned 1,010 adults by telephone and had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus four percentage points. Details are available at http://newspolls.org.The demolition theory has managed to endure what would seem to be enormous obstacles to its practicality. Controlled demolition is done from the bottom of buildings, not the top, to take advantage of gravity, and there is little dispute that the collapse of the two towers began high in the towers, in the areas where the airplanes struck.Moreover, a demolition project would have required the tower walls to be opened on dozens of floors, followed by the insertion of thousands of pounds of explosives, fuses and ignition mechanisms, all sneaked past the security stations, inside hundreds of feet of walls on all four faces of both buildings. Then the walls presumably would have been closed up.All this would have had to take place without attracting the notice of any of the thousands of tenants and workers in either building; no witness has ever reported such activity. Then on the morning of Sept. 11, the demolition explosives would have had to withstand the impacts of the airplanes, since the collapse did not begin for 57 minutes in one tower, and 102 minutes in the other.Those who believe in the demolition theory remain unpersuaded by government statements new or old, and the officials who issued the would-be rejoinders say they are not surprised. “We realize that this fact sheet won’t convince those who hold to the alternative theories that our findings are sound,” Mr. Newman said. “In fact, the fact sheet was never intended for them. It is for the masses who have seen or heard the alternative theory claims and want balance.”Mr. Newman was correct that the institute’s reports would not convert those who favor the demolition theories, said Kevin Ryan, who is the coeditor of an online publication, www.journalof911studies.com, that has published much of the material arguing that the government’s accounts are false.“The list of answers NIST has provided is generating more questions, and more skepticism, than ever before,” Mr. Ryan said.Mr. Newman said, “NIST respects the opinions of others who do not agree with the findings in its report on the collapses of WTC1 and WTC2.”The State Department report, which officials said was written independently of the new institute study, is titled, “The Top Sept. 11 Conspiracy Theories” and says, “Numerous unfounded conspiracy theories about the Sept. 11 attacks continue to circulate, especially on the Internet.” Produced by an arm of the State Department known as a “counter-misinformation team,” the report is dated Aug. 28 and appears as a special feature on the department’s Web site, at http://usinfo.state.gov/media/misinformation.html.The report brought to light one little-known detail about the morning: a private demolition monitoring firm, Protec Documentation Services, had seismographs at several construction sites in Lower Manhattan and Brooklyn.Those machines documented the tremors of the falling towers, but captured no ground vibrations before the collapses from demolition charges or bombs, according to a separate report by Brent Blanchard, the director of field operations for Protec. It is available online at www.implosionworld.com.Asked for comment, Mr. Ryan said that his online 9/11 journal would soon publish an article on those seismic recordings. He also maintained that the Protec paper did not adequately address why puffs of smoke were seen being expelled from some of the floors. However, the federal investigators said that about 70 percent of a building’s volume consists of air, and what looked like puffs of smoke were jets of air — and dust — that were pushed ahead of the collapse.Among those now propelling the argument that explosives took down the trade center is Steven E. Jones, a physics professor at Brigham Young University, coeditor with Mr. Ryan of www.journalof911studies.com, which published his paper, “Why Indeed Did the World Trade Center Buildings Completely Collapse on 9-11-2001?”In an e-mail message yesterday, Professor Jones did not explain how so much explosive could have been positioned in the two buildings without drawing attention. “Others are researching the maintenance activity in the buildings in the weeks prior to 9/11/2001,” he wrote.He said his investigation was finding fluorine and zinc in metal debris and dust gathered from near the trade center site, and argued that those elements should not have been found in the building compounds. “We are investigating the possibility of thermite-based arson and demolition,” he wrote, referring to compounds that, under controlled circumstances, can cut through steel.The federal investigators at the National Institute of Standards and Technology state that enormous quantities of thermite would have to be applied to the structural columns to damage them. Not so, said Professor Jones; he said he and others were investigating “superthermite.”Professor Jones also argues that the molten steel found in the rubble was evidence of demolition explosives because an ordinary airplane fire would not generate enough heat. He cited photographs of construction equipment removing debris that appeared to be red.In rebuttal, Mr. Blanchard of Protec said that if there had been any molten steel in the rubble, it would have permanently damaged any excavation equipment encountering it. “As a fundamental point, if an excavator or grapple ever dug into a pile of molten steel heated to excess of 2000 degrees Fahrenheit, it would completely lose its ability to function,” Mr. Blanchard wrote. “At a minimum, the hydraulics would immediately fail and its moving parts would bond together or seize up.”'"
"'06-09-02,'0','The scientific journal Nature has corrected a press release and is considering whether to add further information to an article published last week reporting that human embryonic stem cells could be generated without destroying an embryo.The article has political consequences because destruction of embryos, which is unavoidable with present methods, is the main stated objection of many who oppose embryonic stem cell research.The journal’s action follows numerous news reports on the article and criticism from the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, which pointed out that embryos used in the research were being destroyed, a fact made clear in the scientific paper but not the press release.Both the journal and the principal author of the article, Dr. Robert Lanza of Advanced Cell Technology, say that the scientific report is correct and that any addition would be solely for purposes of clarification.“We’re looking to see if the description is clear, but there is nothing wrong with the paper,” a Nature press officer, Ruth Francis, said yesterday.'"
"'06-09-02,'0','Two other politicians have declared their candidacy in the party election of Sept. 20: Taro Aso, the hawkish foreign minister, and Sadakazu Tanigaki, the finance minister, who has emphasized repairing Japan’s strained relations with China and South Korea.But polls indicate that neither has a chance of mounting a serious challenge against Mr. Abe, who remains the leading choice of the general public and, more important, the party lawmakers and members who will cast the votes.Japan has been adjusting in recent weeks to Mr. Abe’s apparently inevitable victory, especially since his most serious challenger, Yasuo Fukuda, a veteran lawmaker, decided against running earlier this summer.Mr. Koizumi is said to have long favored Mr. Abe, whom he appointed as the chief cabinet secretary, the government’s second most visible position after prime minister. Recently, as Mr. Koizumi’s interest in government seemed to wane in his last weeks in office, Mr. Abe appeared to have already grabbed the baton.His image as Mr. Koizumi’s heir apparent was further solidified after North Korea tested long-range missiles in early July. The perceived threat from North Korea played to Mr. Abe’s strengths as a hawk, and he wasted no time in suggesting that Japan, a pacifist nation, should debate whether it should acquire the military capacity for a pre-emptive strike.At 51, Mr. Abe would become postwar Japan’s youngest prime minister and the first born after World War II. He is considered politically inexperienced compared with his two rivals, having held no cabinet position until his current one.Until a few years ago Mr. Abe was known among voters mainly for being the son of Shintaro Abe, a Liberal Democrat who almost became prime minister, and the grandson of Nobusuke Kishi, a cabinet member during the war, who was imprisoned as a Class A war crimes suspect but was never tried and who became prime minister in 1957.But Mr. Abe shot to political stardom by taking a hard-line stance against North Korea, which admitted in 2002 that it had kidnapped several Japanese citizens in the 1970’s and 1980’s. By articulating popular anger — fanning it, critics say — against the North, Mr. Abe developed an image of strong leadership that helped increase his popularity.Experts predict that Mr. Abe will hew to Mr. Koizumi’s domestic and foreign policies. Like Mr. Koizumi, Mr. Abe has taken a hard stance against China and South Korea, which have refused to hold summit meetings with Japan because of Mr. Koizumi’s annual visits to the Yasukuni Shrine, the memorial where Japan’s war dead are enshrined along with top war criminals.Mr. Abe, who has staunchly supported the visits, is regarded in Japan more of a hard-liner than Mr. Koizumi. Unlike Mr. Koizumi, who has accepted the validity of the Tokyo trials in which Japan’s wartime leaders were judged, Mr. Abe has not.Mr. Koizumi led efforts to change the Imperial Household Law to allow women to ascend the imperial throne. Mr. Abe is widely known to have opposed the proposal.Over the years, Mr. Abe has supported nationalist scholars in their efforts to revise school textbooks that they say overemphasize Japan’s wartime misdeeds.In foreign policy, Mr. Abe has emphasized building stronger ties with Australia, India and other countries that he says share values of democracy and human rights with Japan — comments that have been interpreted as putting distance between Japan and China.Like Mr. Koizumi, Mr. Abe has said strengthening Japan’s alliance with the United States will, more than anything else, guarantee Japan’s prosperity. “The Japan-U.S. alliance is the most important thing for our country’s diplomacy and national security,” he said Friday.'"
"'06-09-02,'0','The McDonald’s Corporation said yesterday that the hedge fund investor William A. Ackman planned to buy more than $793.8 million worth of shares, two weeks after he reported that he had sold all his stock.McDonald’s said in a regulatory filing that it had been notified of the stock-purchase plans of three funds managed by Pershing Square Capital Management, a hedge fund run by Mr. Ackman. The purchase would give him 1.8 percent of McDonald’s outstanding shares.Mr. Ackman sold his remaining 105,125 McDonald’s shares in the second quarter after the chain bought back $1 billion of stock and agreed to license 1,500 restaurants. He had proposed last year that McDonald’s sell 65 percent of its company-owned restaurants in an initial public offering and borrow $14.7 billion to finance a stock repurchase.“It’s an awfully big company to make a run at,” said Janna Sampson, who helps manage $972 million at Oakbrook Investments in Lisle, Ill. “He may have some grand plan he has yet to reveal to us. I can’t imagine he thinks he can revisit the same issues he raised last year.”A spokeswoman for McDonald’s, Anna Rozenich, said the company disclosed Pershing Square’s move to be “open and transparent” ahead of next month’s plan for a swap of Chipotle Mexican Grill shares for McDonald’s stock.Mr. Ackman proposed the initial offering of McDonald’s company stores a year ago, but dropped his demand after the company said it would provide more information about the margins of company-owned stores, which lag behind franchisees in profitability.'"
"'06-09-02,'0','And so scientists and believers from around the world, on all sides of an extraordinarily charged debate, are watching the meeting carefully.Proponents of intelligent design, defeated in a high-profile court case last year in Pennsylvania, say they are pleased that their ideas, which posit that life is so complex that it requires an active creator, may get a fair hearing in the lofty circles of Professor Ratzinger’s seminars.“I think this is indicative of an opening and expansion of the discussion, the discussion over Darwinism and evolution generally,” said Bruce Chapman, president of the Discovery Institute, one of the main proponents of intelligent design. “It’s very helpful to our desire to see an expanded dialogue in many quarters.”On the other side, scientists and theologians who support evolution say they worry that, even inadvertently, the church may be driving a wedge between itself and science.“If for some reason the Catholic Church gets on the wrong side of the science, then it’s going to in the long term do huge damage, just as it did when they went against Galileo,” said Lawrence M. Krauss, chairman of the physics department at Case Western Reserve University and a highly visible opponent of intelligent design. “It threatened their credibility.”“Because like it or not,” he added, “evolution happened.”The meeting opened Friday morning at Castel Gandolfo, a papal palace that stands as a sort of symbol for the church’s coexistence with science. Castel Gandolfo houses a world-class observatory — with a telescope that Pope John Paul II enjoyed looking through — built a century after the church acknowledged its mistake in condemning Galileo for his postulation that planets revolve around the sun.Similarly, the church has moved from neutrality to something like acceptance of evolutionary theory, though drawing a thick bottom line that God is the ultimate creator.In 1996, Pope John Paul declared evolution “more than a hypothesis,” and in 2004 as Cardinal Ratzinger, Pope Benedict endorsed the scientific view that the earth is roughly four billion years old and that species changed through evolution. Indeed, there has been no credible scientific challenge to the idea that evolution, the foundation of modern biology, explains the diversity of life on earth.Given that history, scientists and church experts say they cannot imagine the study session ending with any alignment of the pope or the church with intelligent design or American-style creationism, which often posits that Earth is only about 6,000 years old.“I suspect they will try to avoid it,” said the Rev. Joseph Fessio, an American priest and former student of the pope’s, who is taking part in the meeting, “because intelligent design has been represented either as a religion, which it is not, or as a science, which I think is indefensible.”But Father Fessio and others say the pope, based on his statements and writings, remains deeply concerned specifically about the contention among some supporters of modern evolution that the theory refutes any role of God in creation.“Given this ideology, the temptation or danger is real to say that you don’t have any need of God, that the spirit doesn’t exist,” said Msgr. Fiorenzo Facchini, an Italian priest and paleoanthropologist. “And the church should keep guard against this and denounce it.”Monsignor Facchini wrote an influential article this year in the Vatican newspaper, L’Osservatore Romano, praising as “correct” the decision in January by a judge in Pennsylvania that intelligent design should not be taught as a scientific alternative to evolution.Nonetheless he cautioned that the mechanisms of evolution are not all known — and that just as religion has no business in science, science should not overstep its bounds in declaring that God could have no role in creation.That is a similar line of thinking presented over many years by Benedict, whose main preoccupation is growing secularism, and it is likely to be a central part of the discussions this weekend.In his book “Truth and Tolerance” (Ignatius Press, 2004), written when he was Cardinal Ratzinger, he wrote of what he called an effort to turn evolution into a “universal philosophy” that explained all of life.“This evolutionary ethic that inevitably takes as its key concept the model of selectivity, that is, the struggle for survival, the victory of the fittest, successful adaptation, has little comfort to offer,” he wrote. “Even when people try to make it more attractive in various ways, it ultimately remains a bloodthirsty ethic.”After John Paul died in April 2005, Benedict signaled a similar concern in his homily at the Mass in which he was formally installed as pope.“We are not some casual and meaningless product of evolution,” he said. “Each of us is the result of a thought of God. Each of us is willed, each of us is loved, each of us is necessary.”But some students of the pope say his doubts go deeper into the science of evolutionary theory. In his writings he has echoed the questions of anti-Darwinians about how evolution can transform one species into another.The pope “does not accept at face value the scientific theory,” said Dominique Tassot, director of the French group, the Center for Studies and Prospectives on Science. “He wants to make people reconsider the question.”As might be expected from a German professor, all sides of the evolution question will get a hearing, though with an emphasis on skepticism. The seminar on Friday reportedly began with a presentation by Peter Schuster, an eminent molecular biologist, president of the Austrian Academy of Sciences and a defender of evolution.There will be three other speakers to the study group, most notably Cardinal Christoph Schönborn of Vienna, who sparked a contentious debate last year after he wrote an Op-Ed article for The New York Times questioning evolution. The article was submitted by the same public relations firm used by the Discovery Institute.The two other speakers are Professor Robert Spaemann, a German philosopher who has criticized evolution as a full philosophical theory; and the Rev. Paul Elbrich, a Jesuit priest and scientist whose work on proteins questions whether chance alone could play the decisive role in evolution.The pope’s annual seminars do not shy away from difficult topics. Last year the issue under discussion was Islam.'"
"'06-09-02,'0','Stephen P. Holmes, chairman, president and chief executive of Wyndham Worldwide, the hotel company spun off last month by the Cendant Corporation, has 10 solid lodging brands competing in what is now a thriving market. Cendant acquired Wyndham Hotels and Resorts in October from the Blackstone Group. Wyndham’s other brands include well-known names like Ramada, Days Inn, Super 8, Howard Johnson and Travelodge. Mr. Holmes discussed their prospects recently. Following are excerpts:Q. New companies and brands are entering the hotel industry. How can Wyndham, which has many old-line brands, remain fresh?A. The economy-hotel sector is where we compete heavily; Days Inn and the Super 8 brands, our two largest in that sector, are powerhouses, have been and will be for a very long time. A lot of what you’re seeing come on now is niche players in certain markets, but they will not be as broadly distributed. There are new-construction Days Inns and Super 8’s that are built all the time, so it’s really a matter of keeping on the quality of the brands that are out in the marketplace.Over the last three years, we’ve gone through a very determined process, called Project Restore, where we have taken out a lot of the product that is not up to our brand standards, and have been bringing in new product that’s better.Q. In the United States, you sell franchises for individual hotels. Will you do the same thing overseas? Will you sell the franchises through a middleman? Or will you require a regional franchisee to operate a minimum number of hotels?A. All of the above. You need to be flexible when you’re competing in an international market. Some of these markets are just developing in their infrastructure. In the U.S., we have a combination of franchised and managed properties. Internationally, our focus will be on direct franchising; master franchising, where we work with a developer who’s going to build multiple products in a particular market; as well as management. We would like to manage the properties that are in the upscale sector, particularly the Wyndhams and Ramadas.'"

Gregory, Jan. 4 to 28; “tempOdyssey,” a dark comedy by Dan Dietz, Feb. 22 to March 18; and “Love and Murder,” a seriocomic murder mystery by Arthur Giron, April 12 to May 6.Another leader in play development, Playwrights Theater in Madison, has three new works scheduled for its main stage. “The Good German” by David Wiltse, about a professor in Nazi Germany who is asked to help hide a Jewish man, runs Oct. 5 to 22 in its New Jersey premiere. “Where the Sun Never Sets” by Robert Clyman, a comedy that brings together shopping malls, trickle-down economics and three Irish cops, is set for its world premiere run from Feb. 1 to 18. “When Something Wonderful Ends” by Sherry Kramer, billed as a “one-woman Barbie play,” has its New Jersey premiere run from April 19 to May 6.Passage Theater Company in Trenton offers two world premieres. “Second Line” by Seret Scott, playing Oct. 5 to 29, follows two African-American college students who fall in love in the civil rights era of the 1960’s. “The Deacons” by Yusef Komunyakaa, May 3 to 27, portrays the reunion of two men 35 years after they served in an underground civil rights militia.The 12 Miles West Theater Company in Bloomfield offers the world premiere of “Tales of an Urban Burb,” a comedy by Rose Caruso of Glen Ridge, who died in 1999. The play, to run April 26 to May 20, looks at the friendships of city dwellers and suburbanites. Also on the 12 Miles schedule are two New Jersey premieres: “Fat Pig” by Neil LaBute, Sept. 21 to Oct. 15, and a musical, “Island,” about a Manhattan couple who go to Jamaica seeking solutions to their problems, Nov. 24 to Dec. 17.The Women’s Theater Company at the Parsippany Arts Center includes in its three-play schedule “My Sister Underground,” by Jewel Seehaus-Fisher of Highland Park. The play, which runs March 2 to 18, tells the story of a radical activist wanted by the F.B.I. who tries to visit her family on Sept. 11, 2001.Even the Shakespeare Theater of New Jersey in Madison is bringing a new play to the stage. Bonnie J. Monte, the theater’s artistic director, has written an adaptation of Jane Austen’s “Pride and Prejudice.” Ms. Monte is also directing the production, which runs from Oct. 17 to Nov. 19.And for those who like their plays as fresh as possible, the Two River Theater Company in Red Bank promises a new play to run March 7 to 25. The play, as yet untitled, will be developed this season in a collaboration with New Dramatists. Also worth looking for are “The Shape of Things,” by Neil LaBute, Sept. 7 to 17 at Premiere Stages at Kean University, and “Expecting Isabel,” by Lisa Loomer, Oct. 27 to Nov. 12 at Dreamcatcher Repertory Theater in South Orange; both are comedies making their New Jersey premieres. “Little Beasts” at Luna Stage in Montclair, April 25 through May 20, is the world premiere of a drama by the company’s resident playwright, Jeanne Marshall.Theatergoers seeking the tried and true will also have plenty to choose from.The schedule for the McCarter Theater in Princeton includes “The Birthday Party” by Harold Pinter, Sept. 8 to Oct. 15; “Translations” by Brian Friel, Oct. 8 to 29; and “Radio Golf” by August Wilson, March 18 to April 8.The six-play schedule of Paper Mill Playhouse in Millburn features the musicals “Godspell,” Sept. 20 to Oct. 22, and “Romance/Romance,” Feb. 28 to April 1, along with Tennessee Williams’s classic “Summer and Smoke,” Jan. 10 to Feb. 11.'"

"'06-09-03,'0','Iraqi officials have asserted that Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia has been severely weakened in recent months, and on Sunday Mr. Rubaie said the terror group faces a serious “leadership crisis.”After his arrest, Mr. Saeedi gave interrogators information that has led to the arrest or killing of 20 Al Qaeda operatives, Mr. Rubaie said. He did not describe the specific roles of Iraqi and American forces in the capture of Mr. Saeedi but said it showed the proficiency of Iraqi forces “backed up by multinational forces.”Despite the high-profile killing of Mr. Zarqawi and other operations against Al Qaeda, attacks have soared in recent months and Iraq has tipped closer to the all-out civil war that Mr. Zarqawi sought to foment when he was leader of Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia.Even the Pentagon acknowledged last week that Iraqi casualties have risen by more than 50 percent in recent months and that the Baghdad coroner’s office reported that 9 out of every 10 bodies it took in during July 1,800 in total were thought to be victims of executions.Much of those killings have been attributed to violence between Iraq’s Shiite majority and Sunni Arab minority. Bullet-to-the-back-of-the-head executions and other sectarian killings have been common for well over a year but they intensified after Feb. 22, when insurgents bombed the golden-domed Askariya Shrine in Samarra.The man Iraqi officials believe carried out that attack is Haitham al-Badri, an Iraqi native still at large. They have said Mr. Badri and a team of insurgents entered the shrine the night of Feb. 21, tied up police guards, and placed explosives around the shrine which were detonated the following morning.Mr. Rubaie said Mr. Saeedi, who is also known as Abu Humam and Abu Rana, was Mr. Badri’s boss.“He is the direct supervisor of the criminal Haitham al-Badri, who planned and executed the bombing of the Askariya Shrine in Samarra,” Mr. Rubaie said. He added that Mr. Saeedi “carried out the policy of the Al Qaeda organization in Iraq and the orders of Zarqawi to ignite sectarian riots.” His crimes included supervising kidnappers, death squads and insurgents who killed policemen and stole their pay, Mr. Rubaie added.In Baghdad, Iraqi and American officials worked to overcome disagreements over the transfer of direct operational control of the Iraqi armed forces to the Iraqi Defense Ministry. At issue is the delineation of responsibilities between Iraqi and American forces, said an American official, who called the disputes minor.The United States military announced it had formally handed over the infamous Abu Ghraib prison to the Iraqi government on Friday. The prison is empty, because the Americans and Iraqis transferred detainees to other centers before the handover.Also Sunday, Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki reacted sharply to the Kurdish leader Massoud Barzani’s decree that only the Kurdish flag and not the Iraqi flag should fly over government buildings in the northern Iraqi region of Kurdistan. “The current flag of Iraq is the only flag that should be hoisted on every inch of the land” until the government changes it, Mr. Maliki said.Falah Mustafa, a senior official in the Kurdistan regional government, played down the dispute and said the Iraqi flag has not flown for years in the region controlled by Mr. Barzani’s party because it is identified with Saddam Hussein’s massacres. Kurdish officials, he said, would fly a new Iraqi flag once the central government changes the design.'"
"'06-09-03,'0','Andrew Miller knows how different the pennant races are this year.“The Red Sox and the Yankees, you hear about them all the time,” said Miller, the 21-year-old Detroit rookie reliever. “You didn’t hear about the Tigers a year ago.”With a month to go in the regular season, the Tigers were on track for their first playoff appearance since 1987. But before yesterday’s games, their American League Central lead was down to five and a half games — nearly half the 10-game bulge they opened on Aug. 8.And while the A.L. playoff picture had come into focus, 11 of the 16 N.L. teams entered yesterday within four games of a division or wild-card leader.“I can remember the first time I talked with Bob Castellini last winter, the one thing I said was that if we’d be around .500 on Sept. 1, we’d have a chance to win the wild card,” Cincinnati Reds Manager Jerry Narron said, recalling a conversation with his team’s chief executive. “Everybody’s more bunched up this year probably than ever before.”Why is virtually the entire N.L. still in it?The three division leaders — Los Angeles, the Mets and St. Louis — are the only teams more than three games over .500.'"
"'06-09-03,'0','Team strategy is a key part of cycling. Teams send attackers to break away from the pack, and sooner or later, teams not in that breakaway try to close the gap. If the gap is closed, teams use the equivalent of baseball’s middle relievers and setup men to set up the closer.Of the many potential attacks during a race, only one can be decisive. But which one? That is an especially puzzling problem for a team with only one or two riders.Leipheimer described it this way: “You can’t control the race, so you have to gamble. Do you go with an attack or are you patient and wait? Will you miss the break that decides the race? It takes a lot of luck to win a race by yourself, especially when everyone is watching George or Jason or me. You’ve got to gamble and be patient and maybe gamble again.”McCartney used the word gamble, too.“The course is pretty hard, and we want a hard race because people will drop off and a big team may be down to four or five riders,” he said. “Then it’s a gamble. There’s not much you can do. You’ve got to chase everything down or you’ll be gone before the race begins.”The 121-mile course starts and finishes in downtown Greenville. Hincapie lives here and trains on parts of the course almost daily.“Even so, we’re definitely at a disadvantage,” he said. “I don’t know if anyone will be stronger than me, but if there’s a 15-man breakaway and it gets a 15-minute lead, who’s going to chase them down? One team might, but Jason and I aren’t really a team.”Before or during a race, teams sometimes make alliances and work together to control the pace or chase down attacks. Such a one-day marriage would make sense here for those Lone Ranger riders, but as Zabriskie said: “Who knows what to do until the race develops? Sometimes, the more people the big teams have, the more confusion there is.”Chris Wherry of Toyota-United, the defending champion, worries about everyone.“All those big riders are by themselves with no team to help,” he said. “And nobody’s going to help them chase an attack. So you get a couple of nobodies in a break and no one is chasing, and all of a sudden you have a pro champion no one has ever heard of.”'"
"'06-09-03,'0','Aides said Mr. Annan’s goal regarding Lebanon is to gain Iran’s commitment to the Security Council resolution for a halt to the fighting and calls, among other things, for the disarming and dismantling of the Hezbollah militia, which Iran backs.On the nuclear issue, they said, Mr. Annan wants to secure Tehran’s cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency, the United Nations nuclear watchdog, which published a report this week concluding that Iran had not provided necessary assurances that its nuclear program was for peaceful purposes and not for making bombs. The report also noted that a sample taken a year earlier had shown traces of uranium processed far beyond what is necessary for energy production.Hours before Mr. Annan arrived, Mr. Ahmadinejad repeated his warning that Iran would not abandon its nuclear program despite the threat of sanctions from Western powers.“They should know that this nation will not give up its absolute right to benefit from nuclear energy even one iota,” he told a cheering crowd in Miandoab, a city in western Iran, Iranian news agencies reported.The United States is pressing for sanctions against Iran for defying the Security Council, but European countries have emphasized that the door remains open to negotiations. Mr. Larijani is to meet early next week with Javier Solana, the European Union foreign policy chief, to pursue talks.“Both sides agree and accept that the best solution to this problem can be found through negotiations,” Mr. Larijani said in a joint appearance before reporters after the meeting with Mr. Annan.One basis for talks is an offer of trade and aid incentives from the five permanent Security Council members — Britain, China, France, Russia and the United States — and Germany. Iran responded ambiguously to the offer last month.Mr. Rafsanjani said Iran objected to the six powers’ demand that it suspend uranium enrichment as a condition of beginning negotiations. “If you remove the preconditions,” he said, “then there is no hesitation on our part to enter negotiations. This is a fair proposition from our side.”United Nations officials emerged from the talks in an upbeat mood, while conceding that the most important meetings lay ahead.“The tone of the music is appealing,” said Terje Roed-Larsen, a special envoy to the Middle East. “But today is only the first act, and I want to listen to the full libretto.”'"
"'06-09-03,'0','Whipsawed all week by conflicting economic data, stocks finished with a flourish after the last statistics to be released — the growth in nonfarm payrolls — bolstered hopes that the economy might not be slowing as much as feared.Consumer confidence registered its biggest one-month decline this year, as stubbornly high energy prices, a softening of the real estate market and worries about wages and jobs began to take a toll.Tech stocks, including Intel, Hewlett-Packard and Amazon.com, led major indexes higher for the week as investors bet that the Federal Reserve would not resume raising interest rates anytime soon.Lifted by news of better-than-expected sales in August, Wal-Mart, Home Depot and other retailing stocks also jumped. Energy companies, particularly those with big refining operations, fell on news of ample inventories.For the week, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 180.10 points, or 1.6 percent, to close at 11,464.15. The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index rose 15.92 points, or 1.2 percent, to close at 1,311.01. The Nasdaq composite index rose 52.87 points, or 2.5 percent, to close at 2,193.16. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 4.72 percent from 4.78 percent the previous week.'"
"'06-09-03,'0','It is true, as the editorial notes, that wage growth has been slower than expected in the current expansion, but the editorial doesn’t acknowledge that strong wage gains have been realized in 2006 and are expected to continue.In fact, reports are that wage growth has been one of the factors that have caused the Federal Reserve to continue its rate increases this year until the recent pause earlier this month.Moreover, virtually every other economic indicator continues to be remarkably strong: 36 consecutive months of job growth, roughly 5.7 million new jobs created, 4.7 percent unemployment, robust gross domestic product growth, near-record-high homeownership, low interest rates and strong consumer spending.By ignoring all of these positive factors associated with the continuing economic expansion, The Times presents a skewed view of today’s strong economy.Drew CantorWashington, Sept. 1, 2006The writer is a former aide for the Senate Republican Conference.If productivity is high yet real wages are low, then at long last trickle down is proved to be trickle nowhere. The first President Bush was right at first; it is voodoo economics. Why would rational producers pay workers any more than they must, even if more capital is available?The only silver lining is that this wage report might help ordinary hard-working yet Republican-voting Americans see that the “compassion” and “morality” they hear about is little more than a cover for avarice.So, corporate profits are at a historic high as a percentage of gross domestic product, and worker productivity is up, but wages are at a historic low by the same measure.According to the Treasury secretary, it’s “neither fair nor useful” to blame any particular party (his) for this.But the G.O.P. has shown the opposite of any inclination to mitigate this generational trend. Instead, we’re into our third decade of its discredited “trickle-down” rehash.So while 99 percent of Americans are working harder for less so 1 percent can do better than ever, Republicans continue to throw tax breaks at corporations and the rich and tell the rest of us our only other option is unemployment.The theme of the article “Real Wages Fail to Match a Rise in Productivity” is that corporate profits are rising while wages are not. But the accompanying graph shows overall compensation is at or close to a record high.Isn’t the real story that benefits (mainly health insurance) are rising, so real compensation is rising? It appears the pie is growing rapidly, and the share that workers get is rising also. A cynic might suspect class warfare in an election year.With wages falling and corporate profits rising since George W. Bush took office, it is time for wage earners — most Americans — to install a Congress in November more sensitive to the needs of ordinary people, including the increasing numbers of the poor.'"
"'06-09-03,'0','Beating out others for a cab may be among the specialized skills most prized by Manhattanites. But there is probably no fiercer competition than on York Avenue, where well-heeled Upper East Siders with frantically outstretched arms dot the curbs during the morning rush.In the 1980’s, matters became so unruly that a taxi stand was created on York south of 79th Street to impose order. But now, the East 79th Street Neighborhood Association, which helped to create the stand, is calling on the Taxi and Limousine Commission to either make it more inclusive or abolish it.The problem stems from the stand’s double purpose. Cabs at the stand can load up with multiple fares, who pay $5 each to be driven down the F.D.R. Drive to any of two or three stops in the Wall Street area. But cabs are also required to take single riders wherever they want to go.Betty Cooper Wallerstein, president of the 79th Street group, said that drivers frequently refuse single fares in favor of the often more lucrative Wall Street run, and that some riders even tell people that the stand is only for the Wall Street groups.Riders say the conflicts sometimes erupt into shouting matches. Some years ago, Mrs. Wallerstein recalled, a cabby drove over the foot of a woman who was standing in the street and writing down his license plate number.'"

Until this spring, his only work in the business was as a teenage extra in an episode of “Law & Order.” “I was just passing by, an angry person in a mob,” he says of the role.Since May, however, he has had more frequent work in the industry. His on-screen time in this work has been even shorter than in his very brief “Law & Order” appearance — in fact, it has been nil — but his labors have been more rewarding, he said. They have also been more gratifying than his more substantial past jobs, which have included working as a clerical assistant in a library, a cashier at a Dunkin’ Donuts and a cargo worker at an airport, he added.Mr. Moses is a production assistant in the filming of television programs and movies, an entry-level, nonunion job of miscellaneous chores that offers the possibility of moving into more skilled, better-paying and usually unionized production jobs, including camera operator, electrical or sound technician, scenic artist and wardrobe specialist.He got his start as a production assistant by completing a training course for New York City residents that the Mayor’s Office of Film, Theater and Broadcasting began in January. Mr. Moses is one of 32 people who have successfully completed the free four-week course, which has been given three times so far.A major goal of the course, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg has said, is to “introduce greater diversity” among the workers in the city’s film and television production industry, which some critics say has too few women and members of minority groups, especially in the higher-paying jobs. The administration is also establishing a panel to recommend other steps for increasing local job and training opportunities.'"
"'06-09-03,'0','As “Whispers of Mergers Set Off Bouts of Suspicious Trading” (front page, Aug. 27) points out, there are increasingly sophisticated tools to uncover insider trading in advance of corporate mergers.Through our unparalleled law enforcement experience bringing illegal insider trading cases — from arbitrageurs in the 1980’s, to investment bankers in the 90’s, to hedge funds today — the Securities and Exchange Commission benefits from cutting-edge computer systems using complex algorithms and proprietary market surveillance data that quickly tell us who traded what, where and when.The results? Days before your article was published, we concluded a case in an $8 million scheme by an Estonian financier to profit from inside information hacked from an American company’s computers.In May, we named a 14th defendant in a wide-ranging case of an international insider-trading ring that netted millions by stealing information from Merrill Lynch, BusinessWeek and even a grand jury.In April, the S.E.C. caught three hedge funds, and their tipper, that traded ahead of a merger announcement.The commission has brought more than 250 insider-trading enforcement actions in the last five years.Successfully investigating and prosecuting insider trading is difficult, but would-be wrongdoers should know that insider trading results in stiff financial penalties and even jail time. We have the record to prove it.'"
"'06-09-03,'0','A recent survey by Merrill Lynch may be a starting point. “The specter of recession looms large,” it concluded after polling 161 investment managers, “with a third of our U.S. panel believing recession is ‘likely’ in the next 12 months.”This, of course, is the stuff of a bull market for bonds, and William H. Gross, chief investment officer of Pimco, which manages $650 billion of fixed-income securities, is a true believer. Indeed, his performance suffered in the first part of the year; then things began to turn his way. This summer, the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury bond, for example, eased to about 4.72 percent from 5.25 percent in late June.This, he said recently, “is discounting a lot of economic weakness and lots of Fed cuts in 2007.” He acknowledges that inflation by many measures is indeed creeping higher, but he calls it a traditionally lagging indicator that will soon retreat.Though the yield on the 10-year Treasury has already fallen nearly half a percentage point, and Mr. Gross has extended the average Pimco bond maturity to 10 years from 7, he argued that this was only the beginning. “A typical bull market in bonds has been about 250 basis points, 2½ percent,” he said. “So were this to follow historical parameters, you might see the 10-year fall from 5¼ to as low as 3 percent at some point, maybe in 2008.”Mickey D. Levy, chief economist at Bank of America in New York, espoused the opposite, a bearish view, though he was less forceful about it.“I think it’s in the cards that inflation is going to drift higher through year-end,” approaching 3 percent, excluding the volatile energy and food components, he said. And that, he added, means “continued upward pressure” on interest rates.“The bond market’s been very sanguine about inflation, and I think rates are a little too low here,” Mr. Levy said, with investors acting on what he called an erroneous assumption that an economic slowdown necessarily reduces inflation. History suggests that it does not, Mr. Levy said; in his view, no cuts by the Federal Reserve are even in sight. (He thinks that the economy will continue to grow at a moderate pace of 2.75 percent to 3 percent.)An even more bearish analysis, from Lehman Brothers, predicts not only a quarter-point rate increase by the Fed this month but also a second one, bringing the Fed funds target rate to 5.75 percent by year-end.Of course, the Fed directly controls only the shortest-term interest rates; investors’ expectations of inflation determine them for the longer term. In fact, raising short-term rates can reassure investors in longer-maturity issues that the Fed won’t let the economy overheat to the point of unleashing inflation, and its vigilance helps depress long rates.That the 10-year bond now yields substantially less than the target rate reflects other forces as well, like heavy purchases of Treasury issues by foreigners awash in dollars earned from trade surpluses. But important as it is for bond investors to monitor the economy, this may not be the key to profits.Burton G. Malkiel, a professor at Princeton known for the view that the stock market is so efficient that price moves are unpredictably random, says he believes that this is even truer for bonds. While you have a better-than-even chance of forecasting the economy in the short run, Professor Malkiel said, “I’m not at all sure that you are more than 50-50 in calling turning points.”And while he thinks the Fed has probably finished its tightening, “whether we can make predictions about the bond market is what I’m much less certain about.” One reason: bonds, unlike stocks, show no long-run trend.For investors seeking a middle ground, the dominant view seems to be that rates have peaked but that there is no urgent need to load up on distant-maturity bonds, which would benefit most from receding bond rates.“We think the economy is headed for an extended period of slow, below-trend growth,” said Edward F. McKelvey, senior economist at Goldman Sachs. The Fed’s next move “will be a cut,” Mr. McKelvey added, though probably not until next spring.While that means it would be profitable to extend maturities, it is still early. “There’s always an issue of how we perceive things against how the market perceives them,” he said. “The market may need a little more convincing before it’s really appropriate to go longer.”Robert B. MacIntosh, a director of municipal bond investments at Eaton Vance, is similarly inclined. The Fed has “reluctantly” paused, he said, and will be in no rush to reverse course. Investors can buy bonds gingerly now, he says, if they keep these caveats in mind: that tax-exempt issues are not the screaming buys they were earlier in the year; that you don’t want to own bonds that can be called when rates ease; that maturities of 15 years should be the limit; and that you don’t sacrifice quality for higher returns.“If there’s ever a time you ought to steer clear of high-yield stuff, it’s right now,” when the economy is cooling, Mr. MacIntosh said.Bond mutual funds that use leverage, analysts also note, have for the most part lost this advantage. It is no longer possible to borrow money at low short-term rates and pump up returns by using the borrowings to buy longer bonds paying a higher rate. This benefit, called “carry,” disappeared when short rates exceeded long rates.ANOTHER mainstream view is expressed by J. Mark Joseph, president of Sentinel Wealth Management, a financial planner in Reston, Va. “We’re fairly dubious” about the Fed’s next move, he said, adding that he has tried to discourage the few clients who have asked whether this might be a good time to consider, say, the 10-year Treasury bond.Any decline in rates won’t be rapid, Mr. Joseph said, and various studies have found that, over the decades, there is little extra reward for the risk investors assume when they commit to bonds with maturities of more than five to seven years.Client portfolios at Sentinel average about two years before maturity for the fixed-income component, about 40 percent of the total, with increased purchases in recent years of the bonds of other developed countries.Emerging-market bonds, which turned in big gains last year, are now suspect, advisers say. “You’ve always got to be careful when you’re coming up with blistering performance,” Mr. Joseph said. “It precedes a decline in many cases.”The supercautious investor is likely to remain in highly liquid instruments like savings accounts — most advantageously at Internet banks — as well as money market funds and Treasury bills and notes.Peter L. Bernstein, the financial adviser and analyst, declared in a recent issue of his newsletter that whatever one’s view, Treasury securities are splendid insurance against an unknowable future. “The long end is a hedge against deflation,” he wrote. “The short term is a hedge against inflation because you get a higher rate of interest every time you roll them over.”'"
"'06-09-03,'0','Typically, growth stocks tend to outperform value in the early phases of economic expansions and bull markets, Mr. Hsu said. A recent study by Ned Davis Research showed that growth tends to perform best relative to value in the first third of a bull market.That’s certainly not where we find ourselves today. An aging bull market is near the end of its fourth year. And according to a majority of money managers surveyed in August by Merrill Lynch, we are in the late stages of an economic cycle.In this environment, “if you go out and buy really expensive companies, you’re going to be fighting an uphill battle,” said Dennis M. Bein, chief investment officer at Analytic Investors in Los Angeles.Moreover, a number of the market’s largest growth stocks — which were the darlings of the late 1990’s — have run into a host of difficulties maintaining their growth rates. “There have been some very notable fundamental issues in some large-cap bellwether growth companies,” said Larry J. Puglia, manager of the T. Rowe Price Blue Chip Growth stock fund. “Intel has had serious deterioration in its fundamentals, Dell has had serious deterioration, and Pfizer showed some pretty dramatic slowing of growth,” he said.Mr. Puglia said he still expects growth stocks to recover soon. But the fact that so many of the biggest and most influential growth stocks are struggling will make it that much harder for the category to mount a serious comeback in the coming weeks.There’s another factor: By most accounts, the economy is either in or near a so-called plateau: the time between the last in a series of interest rate increases by the Federal Reserve to cool the economy and the first in a series of Fed rate cuts to jump-start a new expansion. Plateaus are important because they are often transitions between business cycles.Historically during plateaus, “traditional defensive sectors of the economy do the best,” said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at Standard & Poor’s. These include utilities, consumer staples and health care, he said.During plateaus since 1971, consumer utilities stocks have gained 6 percent, on average; consumer staples, 8 percent; and health care stocks, 10 percent, according to S.& P. The market as a whole gained just 3 percent, on average, during those periods.If these same sectors are the leaders over the next several months, the market would seem to favor defensive-minded value investors (though the health care sector is generally divided between both growth and value stocks).In light of the slowing economy, “our preference is in taking a defensive posture, and that puts us in the value camp,” Mr. Hsu said.Some investors disagree. “In a slowing economy, people tend to look for growth wherever they can find it — and companies that can generate growth in difficult times will be rewarded,” said Ernest M. Ankrim, chief investment strategist at the Russell Investment Group in Tacoma, Wash.In effect, this boils down to a question of probabilities. “Within the spectrum of growth stocks, you are going to see some companies that meet and exceed expectations, and they will be rewarded,” Mr. Hsu said. “But in a recessionary period, the odds for a lot of them doing that are going to be low.”The question for investors is this: How confident are you that you can find companies that will continue to increase profits in a slowdown — or a recession? If you aren’t so sure, you may do better by playing the averages, sticking with defensive-minded value stocks that pay higher dividends than growth stocks, Mr. Hsu said.At the very least, investors should stick to growth stocks that aren’t so economically sensitive — health care shares, for example — while avoiding highly cyclical industries like technology, money managers said.Moreover, before betting on a big comeback for growth, investors may want to “wait for some evidence that the Fed is not only done tightening rates, but that it’s set to start easing rates,” said Jack A. Ablin, chief investment officer at Harris Private Bank in Chicago.THAT may be a smart idea. Historically, growth stocks have beaten value stocks shortly after the Fed starts trimming interest rates in its efforts to jump-start economic growth. Since 1974, growth stocks in the S.& P. 500 index have gained 11 percent, on average, in the six months after the first in a series of Fed rate cuts, according to an analysis by Mr. Stovall. By comparison, value stocks have gained just 7.9 percent.If growth stocks don’t re-emerge as the market’s leaders until the Fed starts trimming rates and a new economic expansion begins, it will mean that growth has underperformed value for an entire business cycle.But it may take an entire cycle to wash out the imbalances of the previous bull market, in which growth trounced value throughout the mid- to late 90’s. “I think after a full business cycle, we’ll just get back to the point where things will start getting back to normal with growth and value,” Mr. Hsu said.'"
"'06-09-03,'0','Not so long ago there were only a few pet lawyers like Ms. Tarnofsky, and they occupied the margins of the legal world. Because pets are viewed by the law as mere property in most states, and therefore worth only what the owners paid for them, pet lawyers worked with little hope of recovering damages and were motivated solely by their love of animals.But in recent years, as pet owners have struggled to negotiate pet ownership in modern life, and as society has grappled with questions of the value and status of its domesticated animals, animal law has become a growing specialty in the legal world. A decade ago only a few law schools taught animal law. Today 70 do, including Harvard, Columbia and Duke. In fall 2004 the American Bar Association formed its first committee on animal law, which many say legitimized the discipline.“The rate of growth in this field is incredible,” said Stephen Wells, the executive director of the Animal Legal Defense Fund in Cotati, Calif. “A lot of the scoffing and raising eyebrows I saw when I started in animal law has gone away.”The rise of animal law — which includes dog bites, custody battles, pet trusts and veterinary malpractice — has divided traditional pet advocates. Many veterinarians, for example, fear that pet lawyers could become the animal-world equivalent of medical malpractice lawyers, reaping large jury awards and contributing to a rise in malpractice insurance costs. The American Veterinary Medical Association formed a task force on animal law last year and came out squarely against redefining the legal status of pets.“We feel if we go into that direction, there are going to be a lot of losers,” said Adrian Hochstadt, a spokesman for the association. “The minute we start with skyrocketing awards, it would lead to higher malpractice insurance rates and higher fees. The only people who would benefit would be a few owners who hit that jackpot and a few attorneys.”Many animal lawyers are careful to distinguish themselves from animal rights advocates. Rather than agitating for the rights of pets — or “companion animals” as animal lawyers prefer to call them — these lawyers say they are concerned primarily with getting the legal system to acknowledge that animals have an intrinsic value beyond mere property, because of the bond between pets and their owners.That bond has changed over time, said Barbara J. Gislason, a Minneapolis animal lawyer, who helped found the American Bar Association committee on animal law, as pets have become more valued for their companionship than for their ability to work, on farms, for instance.“Now people think of them as valuable in a way they never did before,” she said.Animal lawyers argue that the law should reflect this change, especially in cases of negligence. Jeffrey Delott, a Long Island lawyer who has handled pet cases, summed up the position of many animal lawyers this way, “I’d argue that breaking the leg of a pet isn’t the same as breaking the leg of a table.”There is evidence that courts are coming around to this way of thinking. In May an Oregon jury ordered a man who intentionally ran over a neighbor’s dog to pay $56,400 in damages, far more than the fair market value of the animal. Last month, in a case involving a cat called Max, who was tortured and killed by three men, a state appeals court in Washington ruled that a Spokane woman could receive damages based on Max’s emotional value.Other branches of animal law are evolving even more rapidly. In the last five years, 25 states have passed laws allowing pet owners to establish trusts for their animals, to ensure they are taken care of after the owner dies. Frances Carlisle, a Manhattan pet lawyer who specializes in pet trusts and estates, said she has set up trusts for owners of dogs, cats, birds and even turtles.One client took out a $300,000 life insurance policy to pay for the care of his dogs, she said, while another left a house in upstate New York in a pet trust, so his animals did not have to move when he died.As with trusts for humans, pet trusts can be challenged by survivors who feel left out or who see the sums left for pet care as excessive.“A family member could say there’s too much money in this trust,” Ms. Carlisle said. “There’s always the potential for litigation.”Limitations on the value of pets discourage many from suing for veterinary malpractice, pet lawyers say. But those facing eviction from rent-stabilized apartments because of their pets are more willing to spend money on a pet lawyer, said Darryl M. Vernon, a partner in the Manhattan law firm of Vernon & Ginsburg, who specializes in housing cases stemming from pet ownership.Mr. Vernon has had clients who spent more than $30,000 fighting such suits. He said he had successfully defended the owner of a cat that was suspected of being part bobcat and a dog owner whose animal was accused of being part wolf. (Wild animals are illegal in New York apartment buildings.)Most pet cases in New York housing courts come down to what is known as the 90-day rule. Landlords have 90 days to file suit once they know a pet is living in a building in violation of a lease. If tenants can prove that the landlords knew about the pets for longer but didn’t act, they can have the suits thrown out.That was the case last month for Cindy Colón, the owner of Mia and Bella, two Maltese, who lives in a rent-stabilized building in the Bronx. Ms. Colón said she had had her dogs for nearly two years before her landlord attempted to have her removed. She called former doormen to testify that they were aware of the dogs more than 90 days before the suit was filed. She won but spent $25,000 to $30,000 for fees to Mr. Vernon. Ms. Colón said she had no regrets.“It was money well spent, because I won my case,” she said.'"
"'06-09-03,'0','According to the National Governors Association, the National Conference of State Legislators and the advocacy group Americans for Tax Reform, New Jersey leads the nation in the highly dubious category of tax increases. The tax hikes in this year’s budget were the largest in the nation, and no state has raised taxes more per capita than New Jersey since 2002.These increases have not stabilized the state’s finances. New Jersey’s promiscuous borrowing and legendary inefficiency have produced an ongoing fiscal crisis and a simmering taxpayer revolt.It was to begin solving these problems that the Governor and the state legislature put their vacation plans aside. No magic bullet has yet emerged, and obviously the lawmakers have a long way to go to meet the expectations they have thus raised. But for the first time in years, the state’s top officials seem to have grasped the severity of a crisis that has not only disheartened New Jersey residents but driven people and businesses to lower-tax states like Pennsylvania and Delaware — an ironic turn of events for a state that used to lure New Yorkers away with the promise of a lighter tax burden.Painful changes are in order —not least the consolidation of municipalities and municipal services, which could lead to a political nightmare. But having raised hopes so high, the Governor and state lawmakers have left themselves no choice but to deliver in the months head.'"

"'06-09-03,'0','In an age when any kid with a light saber can be an instant YouTube star, why should an artist blow his budget on a professional music video? To accompany his forthcoming folk-hop album, “The Information” (due in early October on Interscope), Beck and his friends made goofy, ultra-low-fi videos for every song and posted some of them on beck.com. Each one looks as if it was made for about $300, most of which was apparently spent on fake mustaches. A man in a fuzzy bear costume raps along to “1,000 BPM.” A blank-faced pixie aerobicizes to “Cell Phone’s Dead,” a trancey fusion of hip-hop and rave music. “Strange Apparition” features ballerinas, a drag queen with a machine gun, and the hairy freak-folker Devendra Banhart, who brandishes a giant comb he has surely never used. The videos, which are a savvy way to generate hype, promise a funky, earthy return to the sounds of “Mellow Gold.”Novelty songs don’t get any better than ”Vans,” these Bay Area rappers’ tribute to the slip-on sneakers popular with 80’s skaters. Over a fuzzed-out, chanted hyphy riff, the Pack lists the shoes’ attributes: they are easy to take off, they stay cleaner than “coke white” Nikes, and they bewitch hot women. Rap boasts are rarely funnier than: “Yeah, ya boy rocks slip ons/But I bet I’ll snatch your chick” when he has his Vans on. Expect a full album on Jive this fall, and expect someone to ship these guys a lifetime supply of checkered Vans, “size 10” and extra icy.Given that many tribute albums seem inspired by little more than an easy pun on a band’s name, it is shocking that we had to wait this long for one called “Radiodread.” Out now on Easy Star Records, this track-by-track reggae reworking of “OK Computer” (1997), Radiohead’s classic ode to alienation, features Jamaican stars and young Americans, and as with most tributes, it is extremely uneven. Several cuts, like Kirsty Rock’s “Paranoid Android,” sound more like vaguely trip-hop covers than dub reinventions. Reggae and Radiohead are an odd mix: while reggae is full of pain and righteous anger, it is rarely cynical or sarcastic. So it is jarring to hear Sugar Minott intone, “We hope that you choke” at the end of “Exit Music (for a Film).” Two stunning interpretations — Frankie Paul’s “Lucky” and the Meditations’ “No Surprises” — milk the earnest sadness lurking in Thom Yorke’s plaintive melodies. And Toots and the Maytals defy the title of “Let Down” with ska so cheery that it reportedly even made Mr. Yorke happy.Everything about My Chemical Romance is unabashedly over the top, so it makes sense that this New Jersey band would follow up a platinum record (“Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge” from 2004) with a messiah complex and eyeliner emo’s take on “Bohemian Rhapsody.” “Welcome to the Black Parade,” the first single from an as-yet-untitled album (due in late October on Reprise), crams an entire rock opera into one gloriously bombastic, multipart song. (Piano intro? Check. Martial drums? Check. Defiant demons? Check.) Like a superhero, the singer Gerard Way is drafted into the goth army by his mystical father. “He said, ‘Son, when you grow up would you be the savior of the broken, the beaten and the damned?’ ” Mr. Way sings. (Apparently the answer was, “Hell, yeah.”) His misfit lambs can scream along to two slogans: “We’ll carry on” and “You’ll never break me.” And just in case the track is still too subtle, it closes with the boom of a firing cannon. The weirdest potential rock smash of the year.Fabric, a trend-setting club in London, produces a reliably enjoyable dance series called “Fabriclive,” featuring regular D.J.’s from its Friday-night party. The 29th installment was led by the Australian indie dance trio Cut Copy, whose stellar, party-rocking mix moves from Munk’s tragic “Disco Clown” (“You’re all alone in the disco, baby”) to rising acts like MSTRKRFT, to the inevitable 80’s fare, including “Into the Groove(y),” a Madonna cover by Ciccone Youth (an alter ego of Sonic Youth).'"
"'06-09-03,'0','The British author Janet Davey begins “First Aid,” her second novel (but the first to be published in America), by enlisting her readers directly in the action, addressing us as if we were bystanders on a local train from East Kent to London whose compartment her central characters happen to enter. “You hear footsteps, voices and a scuffle outside,” she writes, as a mother, Jo, and her three children board the train. The mother, whose face is bandaged from a recent gash, notes that the compartment is empty but for “a stranger, sitting in the corner seat, with her back to the engine” — in other words, the reader. Even after closing her eyes, “Jo could feel the woman looking at her.”Davey soon drops this conceit, but our status as curious onlookers, tolerated but not welcomed, is set. “First Aid” has little in common with those eager-to-please novels that signpost motivations and drumroll connections lest they be missed. Davey’s prose is a mix of inwardness, indirection and a pinch of crankiness reminiscent of Jean Rhys. By conventional standards, the narrative is undramatic; what preoccupies Davey are the interstices in routine life that lead to dramatic eruptions, not the eruptions themselves. The result is a sharp, unsettling book that invokes a number of rich tales without exploring them directly. It has a curious power, like watching a play from a very hard chair and finding yourself in a heightened state of observation and attention. Still, you may wish at times that the chair were more forgiving.No sooner has the family entered the compartment than a crisis occurs. The oldest child, a girl of around 14, picks a fight with her mother and younger brother, then bolts from the train during a pause between stations. Jo seems barely to react. It emerges that the family is in flight; earlier that day, Jo’s live-in boyfriend announced that he was leaving, and slashed her face with a broken bottle when she tried to stop him. Once in London, she and her remaining two children decamp to her grandparents’ home, while her runaway daughter, Ella, returns to their seaside hometown. Much of the novel consists of retracing the steps that have brought them all to this pass.Mother and daughter share a deep wish to escape life’s daily routines, whose deadening sameness Davey renders with merciless precision. Shortly after jumping from the train, Ella pictures her mother and siblings at her great-grandparents’ house: “That back room where they ate was so real, clear as a dream ... the dark green curtains with roses on, steamed limp by years of plain boiled vegetables. She knew what they would be talking about, not just the words, but the words behind the words.” When asked if her mother is doing anything special that day, Ella replies, “Special doesn’t often come into it.”As for Jo, her domestic routine has been further emptied of meaning by the fact that the man she had married at the age of 20 left her for another woman. The treatment of Jo’s divorce and the loss of the family home is oblique, but it still manages to convey the devastation they have wrought. “She had done what she could to keep ordinary family life going,” Davey writes of Jo, after the failure of her marriage. “Ella’s carefully kept mementos had suddenly seemed wrong in the new place and she’d thrown them away ... shells, felt mice, rings from Christmas crackers. ... That was the last of Ella’s tidiness. She never arranged her possessions again.” Yet domestic partnership offers no haven in “First Aid.” On the contrary, Davey seems to delight in the often Dadaistic circularity of connubial conversation, as when Jo’s ex-husband and his new woman bicker over where to park their car:“Try to find a space on top, Peter, I can’t stand that ramp,” she said.Zealous portrayal of crushing dullness is risky — there is always a danger the narrative itself will be flattened. In Davey’s case, this risk is compounded by the withholding nature of her prose. Early on we’re told that Ella and Jo look alike: “They have the same facial bones and almost identical hair,” Davey writes, without telling us anything about either their faces or their hair — not even its color. Lacking the barest physical description of Jo, I first pictured her as a woman in her 40’s, then in her mid-30’s. I’m still not sure I’m right, or what Davey gained by leaving me to wonder. The emotional detachment of her narration, hitched to Jo’s blinkered state, results at times in writing so abstract it feels dissociated. Arguing with her ex-husband over her negligence of Ella, Jo reflects: “He saw in her replies a travesty of calm rationality. She knew they were based on inattention. Because his own way of talking was functional he assumed everyone else’s was. She should have stuck to particular points.”Still, Davey ratchets up considerable tension, as if the pressure of all she isn’t saying might explode through the terse surface of her prose. Much of this tension centers on Jo’s boyfriend, Felpo, a spirited drifter with a brightly painted van. He had wandered into the junk shop where Jo worked six months before the novel opens, and moved into her apartment the next week. Davey captures the transporting effect of this romance on the beleaguered Jo, and her unwillingness to let it congeal into routine. “She preferred to keep him separate, postponing, for as long as possible, building herself another replica of home, with all the old difficulties creeping up the walls like rising damp.” But Jo’s sexual life was at odds with her domestic one, and she recalls having left her children asleep in the apartment on several occasions to go out at night with Felpo and make love.Ella is deeply threatened by her mother’s sexual awakening, and her recollections of Felpo are laced with a distrust that is doubly potent, in light of the violence we know he will commit. We learn, ultimately, that it was Ella who set Felpo off, though Davey is too subtle a writer to suggest that one mistake can destroy a relationship (or that its correction could set it right). On the contrary, we’re left feeling that the aberration lay in Jo’s even managing to find such bliss amid the stony barrenness of ordinary life. And Davey’s depiction of Jo trying to resume her tired routines after the collapse of her romantic interlude is more deeply painful for its lack of emotional catharsis. “Someone always wanted a drink. Someone always wanted the toilet. It seemed to her hopeless that she was still occupied with these wants. Other things came to an end. But children’s demands continued.”'"
"'06-09-03,'0','I WANTED to be a professional football player when I went to the College of William and Mary. I was like any other young kid, thinking that if I worked hard enough I might have a shot. I remember the first guy I ever hit in college; I thought I’d hit a brick wall. That guy went on to have a great career in the National Football League.And me. Well, in my second year, in a game against Dartmouth, I ruptured a disc in my back. But I’ve always believed that when a door closes, another door opens in life.I worked harder at my academics after I was hurt, even though one of my political science professors told me that because I played football I was never going to do well in his course.He was the one who handed me my diploma at graduation. I asked him if he had said that as a way to motivate me or if he really thought it was true. He said, “That’s mine to know and yours to guess.”One of my mentors at my first job in the business sector would always challenge me. George Newman was a senior vice president at BDM International, a tech company, and he had a strong belief in situational experience.He was supposed to give a presentation at a management conference, and only senior people in the organization presented there. The morning of the presentation he called me and said he was sick and he wouldn’t be in, so I’d have to do the 45-minute presentation. I’m convinced to this day that he wasn’t really sick but wanted a trial by fire for me. I had helped write the presentation, but I had no expectation that I would have to present it. I had lots of butterflies in my stomach, but what got me through it was realizing he believed in me, that I could do it. He was not concerned about getting credit. He was concerned about employees getting visibility.'"
"'06-09-03,'0','It’s a dividing line as real as any in America — those who grapple with race and those who do not. But like most dividing lines, it’s impossible to tell on which side a person stands by looking at them, or at least that’s what I thought at the time. So why get ahead of myself with Jerry? Why dig for land mines when I may not make it past the way he slurps his beer?We met for drinks. Sparkwise, I felt little, but we ended up talking and laughing easily for more than an hour. I told him I was a writer; he told me his five favorite books and how they had shaped his life. He told me he had gone to a seminary as a boy but eventually left the Catholic church; I told him I’d been raised a Pentecostal but mellowed into Methodism as an adult. We talked about our children, travels, mutual love of the blues and mutual dislike of the cold, and then he said he would like to read my books; he thought he would like them. I said he well might not.“How do you deal with it when people you know don’t like your work?” he asked.I quoted a playwright whose name I could not remember who admitted in an interview that he told his friends if there was a choice between being honest and being kind in talking about his work, they should choose to be kind. “Don’t value your opinion over my feelings,” the playwright said.“Like a switchblade,” I said. “Like a bayonet. They slice up your heart with all these ugly, hurtful words and then, while you’re bleeding on the floor, they hand you a Band-Aid: ‘I was only being honest.’ ”SO the following day, when he e-mailed his attraction, I tried to be both honest and kind. No spark, I wrote, but he was great, good company. If he was looking for “the one,” I was probably not going to be her. But if he simply sought intelligent dinner companionship some Friday evening, I’d be more than game.Not a bayonet, I thought, but a butter knife. And still it hurt.By the time he resurfaced a few months later, I had suffered through two terrible blind dates, joined an online dating service, carried on several e-mail conversations that died, actually talked on the phone with a few men, met three for drinks, backed away carefully from each, then canceled the service.A few of these men were black, the others white, and in no case did I find anything remotely resembling chemistry. In fact, so utterly lacking in connection were these encounters that it made me appreciate anew how rare is connection. In the face of human isolation, race seemed to retreat a little.So when Jerry called again, I decided to let the spark thing coast, because at least he and I could talk. “My wounds are licked,” Jerry said. “Have dinner with me.”“Why not,” I said. Maybe, in time, the spark would come.We talked and laughed for four hours, then necked like teenagers in the parking lot in the rain. The next day we e-mailed and text-messaged each other. It was all so much fun, such a heady relief after the months of loneliness.But then, on our third date, things changed. First, he was late and I was irritable. Earlier, I’d had a frustrating discussion with several white undergraduates in my Literature of Slavery class. All semester I had struggled to teach them to think critically about race and slavery and history, to have them challenge their assumptions. They insisted, for example, that racial divisions were as old as time and that the myth of African inferiority preceded slavery, not, as I suggested, the other way around. And they argued that racial genetics were more than skin deep, whether I wanted to believe it or not. How else to account for the way black athletes dominate some professional sports?That evening, when I shared my frustrations with Jerry, he wondered if the students didn’t have a point. “What about all those Kenyan marathon runners?” he asked. “Isn’t it possible there’s some genetic reason for that? Isn’t it possible blacks are just better athletes than whites?”A PERFECTLY innocent question. Yet something small and painful flickered inside my chest. Logically, if one accepts a genetic physical superiority of blacks, one must also accept the possibility of intellectual superiority in whites. Did he not consider that notion? Did he reject it out of hand, or subconsciously believe it? And if I wondered these things aloud would he, like my ex, judge me bitter or oversensitive?I mentioned an essay I’d given my students in which the anti-racism advocate Tim Wise suggests that no one brought up in America can claim to be free of racist indoctrination, that doing so only perpetuates the crime. “What Wise says is that we all must recognize and confront the legacy of the past,” I explained.“I don’t think everyone is racist,” Jerry said. “Maybe racialized. But that’s not a bad thing.”By now my hands were trembling, so I did not ask what he meant by that. I had the feeling that even if he tried to explain I would not understand.I engage with race, but not all black people do. I know several interracial couples in which both people swear race is never an issue, almost never comes up at all. I believe them, but it amazes me. And I know one thing: I can never join that pack.My ex did not grapple with race, at first because he did not have to, being a white man in America, and later because it frightened him. This difference was a small but steady river that ran between us, and the more he tried to ignore it the more I clawed at the banks, and the more I clawed at the banks the larger the river swelled until, at last, we were engulfed. A black person who grapples with race cannot be with a white person who doesn’t. Whether a black person who grapples with race can be with a black person who doesn’t is a different and unresolved question for me, but on the first point I’m solid.So when Jerry called and asked if I would meet him for a drink, I agreed, but this time I went only to tell him. We met a bar with billiard tables. He wanted to teach me to play but I said we wouldn’t have time.“I can’t see you again,” I said.He blinked with surprise. “Why?” he said, finally.I used my bayonet: “Because you’re white, and it costs too much for me to date a white man. It cost me to be married to a white man for 13 years. I can’t do it again.”“That’s ridiculous,” he said, after a minute. “That’s the most ridiculous thing I’ve ever heard.”“Which proves my point,” I said. “It’s not ridiculous.”“You can’t be with any white man?”I may as well face it. Because, after all, Jerry was a good man who worked with troubled kids and lived his life open to relationships with people of different races. And yet I couldn’t be with him, even though, unlike my ex, he did seem willing to grapple with race.But he was nearly 50 and his grappling apparently was just beginning, whereas mine started at 5. For nearly 50 years he’d lived in America and yet it surprised him that race might even be an issue for us. There was an innocence in this, an innocence born of being white. An innocence I could neither share nor abide.We were silent for a minute. Behind us balls clicked and people laughed.'"

"'06-09-04,'0','Fiske now rates Adelphi among 26 “best buy” colleges in the United States. Fund-raising, which slumped to $627,192 in 1997, soared last year to $9.5 million.Adelphi is distinguishing itself in other circles. Two years ago Professor Paul Moravec won the Pulitzer Prize for music. This year Adelphi issued Vital Signs, a major study of social issues affecting Long Island. The women’s lacrosse team has won national championships in two of the last three years.But the recovery was not always upbeat, especially at first. Dr. Scott recalled “hate mail from alumni” demanding, “How dare you ask me for money?”Tensions also lingered on campus. “I heard about the previous administration every day, seven days a week,’’ he said recently. Eventually, “I started hearing from people about the good things they heard about Adelphi. It took a few years for the reputation to catch up.”Students who were interviewed recently were oblivious or indifferent to the ugly past. Matthew Lee, a freshman from Newark, said he knew nothing about the dispute. A classmate, Jhonelle Gravesandy of Brooklyn, said that she was aware of it but that it did not dissuade her from enrolling.Before the troubles began, Adelphi had a reputation as a solid private liberal arts college with noted graduate schools in nursing, education, social work, psychology and business.Dr. Diamandopoulos arrived in 1985 with aspirations to revitalize Adelphi in an Ivy League mold. Indeed, in its advertising, the university called Harvard “the Adelphi of Massachusetts.”But in reality Adelphi shrank during his tenure, losing students, faculty and programs. The library even stopped buying books. The polarizing “Dr. D” banished the alumni association from campus and refused to confer with the faculty, which responded with a no-confidence resolution.Adelphi’s 100th birthday was in 1996, but centennial celebrations were shelved as a tumultuous battle unfolded.The critics’ cause had been energized in 1995 when The Chronicle of Higher Education listed Dr. Diamandopoulos’s annual compensation at $523,626. That made it second among university presidents only to his mentor, John R. Silber at Boston University. The critics formed the Coalition to Save Adelphi and raised $620,000, mostly for lawyers.Meanwhile, defenders of Dr. Diamandopoulos said removing him would be catastrophic. “What’s happening at Adelphi is a watershed moment in higher education,” Dr. Silber said in 1996. A coup “would be nothing short of a national calamity” and “an uncompromising disaster for education,” he said.The state attorney general’s office investigated, and Board of Regents hearings found that Dr. Diamandopoulos’s compensation had actually reached $837,113, plus $2 million in retirement entitlements.The details smacked of “Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous.” The president’s official residence on the edge of the campus was a Tudor house with maid service. Adelphi also bought a $1.2 million Manhattan condominium for his use. It spent $196,275 to upgrade and furnish it, including an electrified system to melt snow on the terrace and $1,800 for towel racks and soap dishes.Other benefits included health, life and property insurance; trips to Europe; and entertainment expenses, including one $454 bar tab with Dr. Silber.But Adelphi’s trustees had never voted on his compensation; only a small committee even knew the details. Adelphi even concealed the largesse from the Internal Revenue Service for five years, incurring an $11,500 fine.The Regents also found conflicts of interest involving two trustees, including the former board chairwoman. Her insurance company was found to have gotten $1.2 million in fees for handling Adelphi’s accounts.In an extraordinary intervention, the Regents replaced Adelphi’s trustees for mismanagement, and the new board pushed out Dr. Diamandopoulos in 1997. He contested the ouster at first but then joined Dr. Silber’s staff at Boston University.Dr. Diamandopoulos did not return a telephone call or respond to an e-mail message seeking comment for this article.The Adelphi case was a watershed episode in higher education, a sobering admonition to nonprofit organizations to govern prudently.In the aftermath, some top Adelphi aides left and others took on less visible roles. Richard Garner, dean of the honors college, described the upheaval as “like being in an accident.”The wounds remained. In three years Adelphi churned through a succession of six presidents. Its revenue was shaky, and so were some of its accreditations. Trustees discussed cutting programs, renting out dorms or even merging with another college. The faculty endured contract concessions and the clerical union went on strike for months.An early signal of the détente between the old and new guards came when the faculty’s union president, Gayle D. Insler, was named a dean. Others involved in the rebellion against Dr. Diamandopoulos also won promotions.“What a remarkable transformation in 10 years; I feel like Rip Van Winkle,” said Devin G. Thornburg, who was the Faculty Senate chairman during the upheaval. He left to work elsewhere and has now returned.Adelphi’s rebirth involved a concerted effort, with various strategies. To draw more applicants, the university reduced tuition, more than doubled student aid to $24 million, marketed the college to high school guidance counselors, expedited student transfers from Nassau Community College, built the first new dorm in 36 years, installed wireless Internet access and opened a new fine arts center.The alumni association was revived, with a mailing list now reaching 73,000. Adelphi also recruited new professors and expanded its specialized programs, including master’s degrees in creative writing, emergency nursing and disaster management.The campus expansion underway includes a performing arts center, a sports complex and a learning center for preschoolers.Some would rather forget the past. “I don’t want to dwell on it,” Dr. Scott said. (For the record, he said his compensation is $405,000. And while Dr. Diamandopoulos rode in an $82,000 Mercedes, Dr. Scott drives a Toyota.)But the faculty union’s executive director, Cathy Cleaver, said, “We should embrace this as part of our history, a point of pride.”She and others agree that because of Adelphi’s near-death experience — and the resulting scrutiny, introspection, reorganization and renewed mission — the university is better off.But Dr. Insler added, “Not that we would ever want to do that again!”'"
"'06-09-04,'0','His wife, Steffi Graf, one of the sport’s greatest women’s champions, and their children, Jaden, 4, and Jaz, 2, were also standing and applauding.So was Becker. Agassi eventually rose again, blew four more kisses, then asked for the microphone from the CBS commentator Mary Joe Fernandez. He chose to give a speech instead of an interview, and his voice was breaking.“The scoreboard said I lost today,” Agassi told the crowd. “But what the scoreboard doesn’t say is what it is I have found. Over the last 21 years, I have found loyalty. You have pulled for me on the court and also in life.“I found inspiration. You have willed me to succeed, sometimes even in my lowest moments. And I’ve found generosity. You have given me your shoulders to stand on to reach for my dreams, dreams I could never have reached without you. Over the last 21 years, I have found you, and I will take you and the memory of you with me for the rest of my life.”With that, Agassi handed back the microphone, grabbed his equipment and walked, pigeon-toed of course, off the court. He walked away from the game that was imposed on him by his father, Mike, when he was a child prodigy in Las Vegas. But the game eventually became something he lived for quite willingly.“I am thankful for my father giving me this game,” Agassi said later.He was not the best American player of his remarkable generation. Pete Sampras, who won 14 Grand Slam singles titles, was. Agassi won eight major titles, and lost to Sampras in four of their five meetings in major finals. But Agassi was unquestionably the biggest tennis star of his generation.“I think in the last 20 years, he’s been the most important person we’ve had in our sport,” said Lindsay Davenport, seeded 10th in this tournament. “I think Billie Jean King made huge inroads for obviously women, but Andre made our sport cool, popular with the younger crowd, exciting. He’s beloved.”In his final seasons, he was also in frequent pain because of sciatica, which was caused by a degenerative back condition. Gil Reyes, Agassi’s trainer, said the injury was linked to slippage in a vertebra.The condition curtailed Agassi’s play this season and led to his announcement that he would retire after this tournament. He considered not playing after some disappointing results in hardcourt tournaments earlier this summer, but he ultimately stuck to his plan. And with the help of a cortisone injection in July and another one Tuesday, he played unexpectedly well.Still, after defeating Marcos Baghdatis in a thrilling second-round match that ended early Friday morning, Agassi collapsed in pain on his way out of the stadium. He lay on the sidewalk, putting a case containing a freshly minted DVD of the match under his head for a pillow.“That was the worst I’ve ever been; I just credit the doctors that I was able to get out there today,” said Agassi, who was administered anti-inflammatory injections on Friday, Saturday and again yesterday morning.Nonetheless, he was far from his best, and his movement, particularly his lateral movement, bore little resemblance to his crank-back-the-clock footwork against Baghdatis.“My heart was telling me to go get him out there,” Reyes said. “He’s hurting bad, and it hurts so bad to see him do it. But his heart was telling him: No. Finish. Finish it out. Leave it all, and when you leave, open up your arms and heart and take something with you that you will never forget.”Although Agassi was nearly always interesting during his two decades at the top, he was not always worthy of admiration. He once spat at a chair umpire at the United States Open. Over the years, he has made offensive jokes during news conferences and the occasional uncharitable comment about a lineswoman or an opponent, including Sampras.But he has been that rare athlete who has made a huge impact on and off the court. On the court, he was ranked No. 1 for 101 weeks and won 60 ATP Tour singles titles.In perhaps his most impressive achievement, he was the only man in the last 37 years to win all four Grand Slam singles titles: the Australian Open, the French Open, Wimbledon and the United States Open.He is the only man to have won them on three different surfaces. When Don Budge, Fred Perry, Rod Laver and Roy Emerson managed it, three of the four Grand Slam events were on grass. Now, only Wimbledon is played on the game’s original surface.Off the court, he has leveraged his celebrity for worthy causes, creating one of the most successful charitable foundations in sports and starting a charter school for underprivileged youth in Las Vegas, his home city.Above all, he has grown up in the public eye, which helps explain why there were also so many tears in the eyes of fans yesterday. A lot of those watching might once have had long hair and questionably colorful taste in clothes, too. A lot of those watching might have said things in their youth that they would not mind retracting.Asked what he would say to his 17-year-old self, Agassi answered without hesitating, “I would say, I understand you a heck of a lot more than I want to be you.”Tennis players are on display, perhaps more than any other athletes. There are no teammates to blend in with, no helmets or masks to hide their emotions. And Agassi has shown his more than most; the highs included his 1992 Wimbledon title and his 1999 French Open title, and the lows included a drop to No. 141 in the rankings in 1997.The defeat to Becker, ranked 112th in the world, came after Agassi managed to add to his list of career highlights with his emotional victories over Andrei Pavel and Baghdatis. “Those two matches were worth a difficult year,” he said. “I’m glad I did it.”Yesterday’s match, which started shortly before noon, had a different vibe from the start. Postponed because of rain, as all of Saturday’s matches had been, it was played in brilliant sunlight, and when it began, the cavernous stadium was only about half full.Becker’s coach, Tarik Benhabiles, said of Agassi: “It looked to me like he was about 40 percent of normal. But I admire him for going out there and trying.”Although Becker has a potent serve, he is not related in any other way to a fellow German, Boris Becker, a tennis star from the mid-1980’s to mid-90’s. Boris Becker won Wimbledon at 17; Benjamin Becker is playing in his first Open at age 25 after spending four years playing at Baylor University.But this Becker, who faces Andy Roddick next, will always have a place in the game, too, as the last man to play Agassi. “It all seemed like a movie for me today,” Becker told the crowd. “Playing Andre, he was my idol growing up. I followed his whole career.”Now, he has ended that career, despite having to deal with cheers for his missed second serves and boos for some of his fine drop shots, and despite looking strangely sluggish for much of the fourth set. “He was tightening up emotionally,” Benhabiles said.Becker shook free of the moment to break Agassi’s serve with three consecutive winners at 5-5 in the final set, then held his serve with ease.“I’ve lost to B. Becker before,” Agassi said much later, when his tears had dried and good humor ruled. “I was proud to shake anybody’s hand today.”'"
"'06-09-04,'0','The show of unity on the right comes one week after a similar gathering of the opposition Socialist Party was overshadowed by divisive squabbling among half a dozen potential candidates, several of whom stepped up their attacks on Ségolène Royal, the front-runner in opinion polls on the left.For three years the rivalry between Mr. Sarkozy on one side and President Chirac and his protégé Mr. de Villepin on the other dominated the headlines. But eight months ahead of the presidential election, Mr. Sarkozy appears to have outdistanced them both.While Mr. Chirac has not ruled out running for a third term, and Mr. de Villepin has seen his popularity recover somewhat with falling jobless figures, neither of the two comes close to Mr. Sarkozy in opinion polls.“For the moment there is no rival on the horizon for Sarkozy,” said Emmanuel Rivière, head of political studies at the TNS Sofres polling institute. The two-round election is scheduled to take place in late April and early May.If Mr. Sarkozy has so far succeeded in fending off his main rivals on the right, winning against the Socialist Party will be harder, Mr. Rivière said.After courting voters on the right with a tough line on immigration and law and order, Mr. Sarkozy now appears to be trying to soften his image in a bid to win votes in the center.On Sunday, he sought to woo young voters by proposing to create interest-free loans for students who want to set up a business, as well as special education savings accounts.Mr. Sarkozy appeared to criticize a flexible work contract the government introduced a year ago, which allows small companies to fire employees without justification during the first two years after they are hired. “I want society to allow you to become adults, adults like others,” Mr. Sarkozy said. “Not adults who are put to the test for two years and can be fired without explanation.”But winning over the youth vote may prove difficult, after two months of student demonstrations last spring over proposals to introduce a similar work contract for people under 26.'"
"'06-09-04,'0','BUDAPEST, Sept. 3 (Reuters) — The Hungarian poet Gyorgy Faludy, a major figure of the resistance against Nazism and Communism, died Friday at his home in Budapest, the national news agency, MTI, reported Saturday. He was 95.The poet, known to many in the West as George Faludy, was part of Hungary’s 1956 anti-Communist uprising and was to have been a major speaker at a conference to celebrate its 50th anniversary this month.Mr. Faludy won international fame with his interpretation of Francois Villon ballads in the 1930’s and his autobiographical novel “My Happy Days in Hell” in the 1960’s, which related his escape from fascist Hungary and his return, and imprisonment, in a country under Communist rule.He fled Hungary twice: first in 1938, when, as a Jew, he was threatened by the growing power of Nazism, and the second time after Soviet tanks crushed the 1956 uprising.Like his fellow Hungarian and anti-Communist writer, Arthur Koestler, Mr. Faludy wandered the world, living and working in France, Algeria, Britain, Italy and the United States, where he taught for two periods at Columbia University in the 1960’s and 1970’s.'"

"'06-09-05,'1','“There’s another example of a guy who carves out a real solid role on special teams, which now is going to create some opportunities to go into the game, and you know how that goes,” Mangini said.A reserve who is a special-teams demon, Mangini said, can create a niche that turns into something much larger. N.F.L. rosters are small, and injuries to starters can provide opportunities for reserves.“I remember Curtis was telling me a story about when he was in New England,” Mangini said. “He’s a pretty modest guy, but he told those other running backs, ‘Look, you guys better hope I never go in the game,’ and they all laughed and thought, ‘Yeah, O.K., buddy.’ And then he got in the game, and there was no looking back.”Mangini added: “I’m not saying that’s necessarily the case with Leon. I’m just saying that’s a great example of what you do when the opportunity comes and how you take advantage of it.”Washington, a fourth-round draft pick, said Monday that he still had a lot to learn. Three notebooks sit on a shelf in his locker, and when he hears anything new, which is often, he writes it down.“I’ve put a lot more in a notebook in a couple of months than I did in college,” Washington said.Meanwhile, Washington has capitalized on the chances given to him in the preseason. He returned a kickoff 87 yards for a touchdown against the Redskins and gained 59 yards on 20 preseason carries, the third most on the team.Mangini said the 5-foot-8, 202-pound Washington had worked on his pass-blocking and ball-handling skills. Washington caught seven passes in the preseason and ran hard enough to give the Jets a spark.“He’s an inspiration to me,” said the rookie receiver Brad Smith, who was selected by the Jets earlier in the fourth round.Like Washington, Smith won a roster spot by contributing on special teams. Smith, a quarterback at Missouri, played quarterback Friday in the fourth quarter of the Jets’ 20-17 victory over Philadelphia. He scored the winning touchdown on a 9-yard run.“I’m just a team player, and the most important thing to do is to win,” Smith said.Washington said unselfishness was a topic often discussed in the rookies’ locker room. The rookies have an attitude that they will help the team in any way they can.Not much is expected of the Jets this season, but the mood in the locker room is cheerful and optimistic. The Jets, who open the season Sunday on the road against the Tennessee Titans, think their offense can generate points.“Time to focus on the little things and make it work,” quarterback Chad Pennington said.Washington, who has earned a spot in the big room between the rookie quarterback Kellen Clemens and the veteran defensive tackle Anthony Clement, said he would keep doing the same.“Just trying to get used to the game is definitely an advantage,” Washington said, sounding like someone who has been around for a while.'"

"'06-09-05,'1','Since the empowerment schools are not grouped by neighborhood, the network leaders set out today armed with cell phones and BlackBerry instant messaging devices, unsure of what the day might bring. One network leader, Judi Aronson, visited two schools in Brooklyn and one on the Lower East Side of Manhattan and found things going smoothly. Her biggest challenge was finding parking for her gray Toyota.“The biggest difference is that last year it was the regional agenda,” Ms. Aronson said. “This year, it’s each school’s agenda.”At Bronx Writing Academy, an empowerment middle school on East 167th Street, students said they saw large possibilities now that their principal, Nick Marinacci, has greater authority over the school budget. Collin Maloney, 13, an eighth grader, had his own wish list: “We really need new lockers and new computers too.”Nearby, Tiffany Daniels, 12, said the school could use some new books but she was less interested in discussing school management than in catching up with friends after the summer break. Tiffany, an eighth grader, had covered her body in glitter spray in celebration of the first day of school. “I love school,” she said. “I feel smart.”Chancellor Klein, seeming chipper at the start of his fifth school year, made his traditional tour of schools in each borough. After joining the mayor at P.S. 8 in Brooklyn, he visited P.S. 31 in Staten Island where he highlighted the expansion of a program for gifted and talented students. He then raced back to Manhattan for a stop at a new girls’ charter school, then off to the Bronx to visit a campus of small high schools and finally to a middle school in Ozone Park, Queens.The president of the city teachers’ union, Randi Weingarten, and a large cast of Democratic politicians, including the City Council speaker, Chris Quinn, used the day to hold a news conference outside P.S. 89 in Tribeca to reiterate the need for smaller classes. “The single most important thing you can do to help teachers do their jobs is to lower class size,” Ms. Weingarten said.City Councilman Robert Jackson, who chairs the Council’s Education Committee, carried a sign that proclaimed, “Small Classes, Big Results.” Mr. Jackson said many high school classes were at the contractual limit of 34 students. “We’re all excited about the first day of school,” he said. “But teachers are not excited about having 34 kids in a class.”Away from the politics and the famous faces, timeless September scenes played out again and again at schools across the city. Slightly anxious children, many with new backpacks and lunch boxes, were escorted to school by only slightly less anxious parents. There were the usual frustrations over late school buses and some enrollment confusion but no reports of any widespread problems.At P.S. 101 in Forest Hills Gardens, Queens, the customary jitters over a new school year were exacerbated by a new policy in which parents were not told the names of their children’s teachers until after classes had begun. Students instead were assigned to classes by number, in an effort, the principal, Ronnie Feder said, to prevent parents from mobbing teachers and delaying the start of lessons.Nancy Baxter, 41, struggled to keep her daughters, Lindsay, 9, and Shay, 6, close to her in a large crowd swirling outside the school. Ms. Baxter waited an hour hoping to learn who her daughters’ teachers were but never found out.“This is dumb,” Ms. Baxter said. Later, the principal apologized. “This was a really bad idea,” Ms. Feder said. “It won’t happen again.”On the walk from home to P.S. 101, Ann Kittredge, told her daughter, Tedy, 6, that she would have a new teacher, a new classroom and new classmates in first grade. Tedy stopped on the sidewalk and gasped. “No,” she cried. “I don’t want to go.”At visits to schools across all five boroughs, however, there seemed to be more smiles than tears.In Brooklyn Heights, Zeke Merlis walked along Middagh Street, a parent on each hand. His mother, Kathleen Varanese, carried a camera to document his first day of kindergarten. His father, Andy Merlis, said Zeke was just a little bit nervous. “He told me this morning, ‘Daddy, I’m not ready.’ I told him he’d do fine.”And indeed, Zeke seemed up for anything, gamely letting himself be lifted up awkwardly by Mayor Bloomberg, who mugged for the cameras and then urged reporters to look at P.S. 8’s test scores, which have risen steeply in recent years as residents of the increasingly wealthy Brooklyn Heights neighborhood have taken renewed interest in the local public school.“If you could do this in every school,” Mr. Bloomberg said, “the future of this city would be assured.”'"
"'06-09-05,'1','JOHANNESBURG, Sept. 5 —Vladimir V. Putin, the Russian president, arrived in South Africa today for a two-day state visit, the first ever for a Kremlin leader, thus reuniting two old ideological soul mates under a new banner: making money.Hours after landing in Cape Town and meeting with President Thabo Mbeki, Mr. Putin told a news conference that Russia plans multibillion dollar investments in South Africa’s economy, he signed a business cooperation agreement and announced a deal to extend sales of nuclear fuel and technology to South Africa’s nascent nuclear power industry.Wednesday’s only important business — wedged before ceremonial visits to scenic Cape Point and the apartheid-era Robben Island prison — is a meeting with 23 Russian and 23 South African business executives aimed at improving commercial relations.The deal-making decisively overshadowed the historic symbolism of this state visit. When Mr. Putin was but a college freshman and aspiring K.G.B. officer in 1970, Mr. Mbeki was in Moscow, studying Communist ideology and receiving military training as part of the Soviet Union’s support for the African National Congress’s guerrilla battle against apartheid.The Soviet Union was the crucial supporter of the African National Congress until the collapse of Communism in 1991. Beyond its commercial import, Mr. Putin’s visit revives a decades-old relationship that had grown chilly under their predecessors as president, Boris N. Yeltsin and Nelson Mandela.'"
"'06-09-05,'1','Tanzania computerized their business and tax registries and reduced delays in customs inspections and the courts. Ghana has cut the corporate tax rate from 32.5 percent to 25 percent and made it easier to export goods.Rwanda scrapped a law, adopted during Belgian colonial rule, that had given one official a monopoly on notarizing documents for the entire country. Côte d’Ivoire slashed the time it takes to register property, from more than a year to a month, by eliminating a requirement that the urban minister give his consent. Benin and Niger stopped mandating that entrepreneurs prepay taxes even before they started operating.Wealthy donors such as the World Bank, the United States and Britain, focused on spurring economic growth and job creation, have begun putting a heavier emphasis on such changes as they decide where to provide aid. The Millennium Challenge Account, President Bush’s signature foreign aid program, explicitly uses the bank report’s measure of days it takes to start a business as one criterion for deciding who qualifies for large grants.Economists outside the bank say the wealth of statistical information compiled in the “Doing Business” report — and the naming and shaming rankings that make it easy to compare the performance of nations — are useful to countries seeking to improve their investment climate.But they also caution that scoring well in the rankings is no guarantee of economic growth and no substitute for a broader economic strategy. “It’s just one piece of the puzzle,” said William Easterly, a former bank economist who is now an economist at New York University.Dani Rodrik, an economist at Harvard University, said the report focuses on steps that get government out of the way — measuring reductions in taxes and regulations, for example — but said often countries need governments that encourage industries through subsidies, preferential tax policies or special zones.“What’s assumed is that if government provides the right environment for property rights, contract enforcement and low taxes,’’ he said, “that these economies will take off, but in actual fact, economic development requires a government more actively involved with the private sector.”Mr. Djankov, an author of the report, agreed that there are things a government can do that may be more important to economic development than the factors measured in the report. For example, he said, building a port may make a significant contribution, but it can also cost billions of dollars and take years to complete, unlike the changes documented in the report.“These reforms are very cheap and easy to do for a government,” he said.The bank’s “Doing Business” report this year ranks 175 countries by the number of days it takes to start a business and on other indicators that measure contract enforcement, investor protections, corporate taxation levels and the amount of flexibility businesses have to hire and fire workers.The nations the bank named as “the top ten reformers” were, from top to bottom, Georgia, Romania, Mexico, China, Peru, France, Croatia, Guatemala, Ghana and Tanzania. Eastern Europe, Central Asia and wealthy Western nations constituted the leading regions, followed by Africa. This year, South Asia brought up the rear.'"
"'06-09-05,'1','The study monitored the health of 12,000 people who helped with the trade center cleanup, a diverse group that included many people in addition to firefighters and police officers. All of them received comprehensive evaluations that included physical examinations, mental health evaluations, pulmonary function tests, chest X-rays, blood tests and urinalysis.Of the group of 12,000 initially examined, 9,500 agreed to allow their results to be used in the report that will be published in Thursday’s edition of Environmental Health Perspectives, the journal of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences.Almost 70 percent of those who responded had a new or worsened respiratory symptom that developed during or after their time working at the World Trade Center site.Among the workers who were showed no such symptoms before 9/11, 61 percent developed respiratory symptoms while working at the site.Almost 60 percent still had a new or worsened respiratory symptom when they were examined for the study.One third had abnormal pulmonary function tests, much higher than expected.Severe respiratory conditions, including pneumonia, were significantly more common in the six months after 9/11 than in the six months before the event.Those who arrived first at the site suffered the heaviest exposures, the report found, which is significant because 70 percent of those screened arrived at the site in the first few days after the disaster, between Sept. 11 and 13.In the past year, the responders seen by doctors involved in the study have suffered from upper respiratory illnesses, like sinusitis, laryngitis, and vocal cord dysfunction; lower respiratory disorders, like asthma and World Trade Center cough; psychological disorders, like post-traumatic stress disorder and chronic depression; and musculoskeletal problems, often from injuries that occurred while working on the pile.Mount Sinai continues to screen responders and has tested an additional 4,000 since April 2004.“We encourage anyone who worked at ground zero, especially in the early days after September 11, who has not yet been screened, to come for an evaluation,” said Dr. Philip J. Landrigan, chairman of the department of community and preventive medicine at Mount Sinai. “It is important that those who gave so heroically in the aftermath of the disaster be assured that they will be able to get all the medical care they need.”Mount Sinai’s ongoing monitoring program is supported with money from the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health.'"
"'06-09-05,'1','The chairman of Viacom, Sumner Redstone, said today that he was replacing his chief executive officer after a fall in the company’s stock price.Mr. Redstone, who has been publicly unhappy with the performance of C.E.O. Tom Freston, said this morning in a conference call that Viacom’s board had asked Mr. Freston to resign and appointed a team led by Philippe Dauman to take his place.“The board was taking a look at our stock,” Mr. Redstone said, and how it had performed since Viacom and CBS were split earlier this year. “CBS was making new highs, and we were seven or eight points down from Viacom’s high. That comparison certainly influenced the board.”Mr. Dauman will have the titles of president and chief executive. In addition, Thomas E. Dooley was appointed to the new role of senior executive vice president and chief administrative officer. The two men had long worked with Mr. Redstone before Viacom acquired CBS in 1999.Although the company said today that Mr. Freston had resigned, Mr. Redstone, the 84-year-old controlling shareholder of Viacom, has been telling associates in Hollywood that he felt Mr. Freston was not a strong enough leader for the company, according to several people who have talked to Mr. Redstone but spoke on the condition of anonymity, saying they did not want to jeopardize relationships in Hollywood.'"
"'06-09-05,'1','President Bush and Republicans in Congress say the drug benefit has been a success, sharply reducing drug costs for millions of older Americans and the disabled.More than 8 in 10 people who are enrolled in a Medicare drug plan say they are satisfied with it, although almost 2 in 10 say they have encountered major problems, according to a survey conducted in June by the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonprofit research group.Democrats say the drug benefit got off to a rocky start in January and is still plagued by inexplicable problems, like Medicare’s mistakenly refunding premiums to 230,000 beneficiaries in August.Colleagues refer to Dr. McClellan as “doctor-doctor” because he is a medical doctor and has a Ph.D. in economics. They say he has also been valuable to the administration as a spokesman, rebutting criticism of its health policies.Dr. McClellan did not fully heed warnings about problems in the first weeks of the new drug plan. At the time, tens of thousands of low-income Medicare beneficiaries were overcharged for prescription drugs, and some were turned away from pharmacies without getting their medications. In January and February, many states took emergency action to protect their citizens.Since then, Dr. McClellan has said he is on a mission to “find and fix any problems that beneficiaries may have” with the drug benefit.On Jan. 1, drug coverage for more than six million low-income people was switched to Medicare from Medicaid. Dr. McClellan had promised “a seamless transition,” but the change was chaotic, as predicted by state Medicaid officials and by the Government Accountability Office, an investigative arm of Congress.Robert M. Hayes, president of the Medicare Rights Center, a counseling and advocacy group, said the transition was “a dark moment” in Dr. McClellan’s tenure.“He was always on message,” Mr. Hayes said. “He said the new program was running fine when the roof was caving in. But I do respect him. He was responsive when we brought individual cases of hardship to his attention.”Dr. McClellan will leave a big piece of unfinished business. Congress reconvenes this week, and lawmakers are desperately seeking a way to avert a cut in Medicare payments to doctors, scheduled to take effect Jan. 1 under current law.Dr. McClellan said recently that physician payments would be cut 5.1 percent in 2007, with similar cuts in later years, if Congress took no action. The cuts, he said, are required because spending on doctors’ services has repeatedly exceeded annual goals set by a statutory formula.The American Medical Association says such cuts would hurt beneficiaries because many doctors might be less willing to accept new Medicare patients.Dr. McClellan has been cautious about discussing job plans with outsiders, partly because his predecessor, Thomas A. Scully, was criticized for negotiating jobs with potential employers while still running Medicare. Mr. Scully had received an ethics waiver, but the White House later told agencies they could not grant such waivers unless they consulted the president’s lawyers.'"
"'06-09-05,'1','Mr. Bush has long argued that Iraq has become the “central front’’ of the war on terror and that one benefit of the war there has been to draw extremists together in one place where they can be fought far from American shores. But the strategies discussed in the report generally apply less to Iraq than to the new breed of small terror groups springing up around the world, and the report acknowledged that “the ongoing fight for freedom in Iraq has been twisted by terrorist propaganda as a rallying cry.’’Mr. Bush again alluded to Iran, whose people share with some Iraqis an enmity toward the United States, even though Iran and Iraq fought a bloody war some two decades ago. The United States and its allies, he said, “will not allow Iran to develop a nuclear weapon.”Last week, Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld and Vice President Dick Cheney both used forms of the verb “appease” in referring to critics of the Iraq war, prompting complaints from Democrats that they were cynically invoking images of British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain’s attempt to satisfy Hitler’s ambitions at a 1938 meeting at Munich.The president did not go that far today. But he did liken the battle against Osama bin Laden and his followers to earlier struggles against the aspirations of Lenin and those of Hitler, “a failed Austrian painter.”“The question is, will we listen?” Mr. Bush said. “Will we pay attention to what these evil men say?”If free peoples do not heed the call of history, Mr. Bush said, “Fifty years from now, history will look back on our time with unforgiving clarity.”The president’s focus on Iran, and to a lesser extent Syria, as backers of terrorist groups, comes as the administration is seeking to pressure them to reduce their support for Hezbollah in Lebanon.In the case of Iran, which the report singles out as “the most active state sponsor of terrorism,’’ Mr. Bush is also currently seeking to win agreement at the United Nations Security Council for sanctions to punish Iran for refusing the council’s request that it halt nuclear enrichment.“Most troubling is the potential WMD-terrorism nexus that emanates from Tehran,’’ the report said.The possibility that Saddam Hussein might develop “weapons of mass destruction” and pass them to terrorists was the prime reason Mr. Bush gave in 2003 for ordering the invasion of Iraq.In the report, the White House cited progress on a number of fronts, saying “We have done much to degrade Al Qaeda and its affiliates and to undercut the perceived legitimacy of terrorism.’’ The report also said that counterterrorism measures have been expanded at home and abroad.A group of top Democrats held a press conference today before Mr. Bush’s speech to release a report that they said showed the president’s approach to terrorism to be a failure. The report was compiled by the Third Way National Security Project, a nonprofit advocacy group that describes itself as progressive.“Under the Bush administration and this Republican Congress, America is less safe, facing greater threats, and unprepared for the dangerous world in which we live,’’ said Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the Democratic leader in the Senate. “This new report is a stunning indictment of Bush foreign policy, and it makes a clear case for the new direction we need to keep America safe.”Sharon Burke, the project’s director, said that the study showed that the number of al Qaeda members had grown from about 20,000 in 2001 to about 50,000 today, and that terrorist attacks worldwide were up sharply. The number and power of insurgents in Iraq and Afghanistan are also on the rise, she said, while the strength and readiness of the American military have been drained by the war in Iraq.“The numbers show that the president’s strategy is not working,’’ she said.The one point on which both reports agreed is the growth of small terrorist cells that operate outside of centralized organizations like al Qaeda.“Our effective counterterrorist efforts, in part, have forced the terrorists to evolve and modify their ways of doing business,’’ the White House report said. “Today, the principal terrorist enemy confronting the United States is a transnational movement of extremist organizations, networks and individuals.’’In recent speeches, Mr. Bush has taken to calling the enemy “Islamo-fascists.’’ Today’s report said that what united the movement was “a common goal of ushering in totalitarian rule,’’ but did not use the president’s term, saying instead that the terrorists were exploiting Islam.Also absent from the report was any mention of Osama bin Laden. Instead, it recounted among the administration’s successes that “most of those in the Al Qaeda network responsible for the Sept. 11 attacks, including the plot’s mastermind, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, have been captured or killed.’’At a briefing about the report, the White House homeland security adviser, Fran Townsend, said that “bin Laden remains the number-one target, but he’s not the only target.’’“The greatest threat to us is this ideology of violent extremism, and its greatest public proponent is Osama bin Laden,’’ Ms. Townsend said.Ms. Townsend said that “the long-term antidote to terrorism is freedom and democracy.’’In the short term, she said, the administration has been looking for ways to attack terrorist groups by going after their vulnerable points: their need for leadership, recruits, money, communications and weapons.But the report gives relatively few specifics concerning what it calls the most urgent problem, that of denying terrorists access to unconventional weapons and fissile material in particular. While it talks about the need to block rogue states from supplying such materials, there is no discussion of the nuclear networks, like the one formerly run by Pakistan’s top nuclear scientist, A. Q. Khan, that have been the main source for the spread of nuclear weapons technology.The report also notes the “increasingly sophisticated use of the Internet and the media’’ that has allowed terrorists to recruit and communicate.'"
"'06-09-05,'1','Things were even uglier on the Miami side, where Hurricanes Coach Larry Coker gutted his staff in the off-season. Much of that was an attempt to recharge an offense that had steadily grown anemic.But a new coordinator, quarterbacks coach and offensive line coach did not appear to do much help. Miami mustered 2 rushing yards on 26 carries and 132 yards of total offense. In the second half, the Hurricanes were shut out and had only 17 total yards.Miami’s last three drives were a comedy of errors. They included three fumbles, a procedure penalty, a dropped pass on third-and-9 by the freshman Sam Shields, and an interception to end Miami’s hopes.By the end of the game, Coker was begging Hurricanes fans to give this team a chance. This was Coker’s second consecutive loss to Florida State to open the season. The Seminoles snapped a six-game Miami winning streak in the series last year.“I want to make sure our fans don’t give up on this football team,” Coker said. “This is going to be a good football team. We’ve got some good players. It’s a long season.”A little later, Miami Athletic Director Paul Dee kicked 20 reporters out of the Hurricanes’ locker room. That provided a fitting ending for an all-around ugly night in Miami. The Hurricanes averaged 2.5 yards per offensive play, punted nine times and committed nine penalties.Miami was without its top tailback, Tyrone Moss, and its top receiver, Ryan Moore. But its shaky offensive line, the team’s biggest weakness last year, yielded three sacks.“Anytime you lose it’s frustrating, but this one seems to hurt worse,” Miami offensive lineman Anthony Wollschlager said.But he added, “This loss does not and will not define this team.”Bowden attributed his team’s struggles to a stout Miami defense, which he said could be the best that the Seminoles face all season. But the play-calling issues surrounding Bowden’s son Jeff, the team’s offensive coordinator, will inevitably became a controversy again this season.“Obviously we’re going to be disappointed,” running back Lorenzo Booker said. “There’s a lot of things that we could have done different. But Florida State and Miami, it’s going to be a war. It’s always been a defensive battle.”Entering the fourth quarter, Florida State had rushed for 3 yards on 16 carries. But two passes highlighted its only touchdown drive. The first was a 27-yard completion from Drew Weatherford to De’Cody Fagg on a third-and-10 that gave the Seminoles momentum late in the third quarter. A 35-yard dump pass toBooker, with help from a missed tackle by Miami linebacker Glenn Cook, followed to set up their only touchdown.Miami’s only scores came thanks to two foolish Florida State penalties. In a series known for its superfluous penalties and post-whistle shenanigans, Florida State defensive lineman Paul Griffin added another lowlight in the second quarter.Griffin speared Miami tailback Charlie Jones well after he had been stopped for a 3-yard loss. Instead of a second-and-goal from the Florida State 18-yard line, Miami jumped to the 9-yard line. Two plays later, Jones ran through safety Roger Williams and scored on a 4-yard run to give Miami a 7-3 lead.Griffin’s late and foolish hit on Davis encapsulated a first half riddled with mistakes and sloppy play. Miami took a 10-3 lead into halftime after adding a field goal set up by another Florida State penalty. A blatant late hit by offensive lineman Shannon Boatman pushed the Seminoles back to their own 9-yard line and set up a third-and-15, too big a task for their offense on this night.After a punt, Miami took over at midfield and then Wright got hot, completing 7 of 9 passes to set up Jon Peattie’s 20-yard field goal.But that was not nearly enough, as Miami and its annual series with Florida State lost even more luster.'"

The depression had sustained winds near 35 miles per hour, 4 m.p.h. shy of becoming a tropical storm and the sixth named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season. It was centered about 1,200 miles east of the Lesser Antilles and moving northwest at 12 m.p.h., a path forecasters at the National Hurricane Center said they expected it to follow for the next day.

"'06-09-05,'1','So far, the biggest problem presented by the fake drugs is violation of intellectual property rights, cutting into the profits of pharmaceutical companies. There do not appear to have been major injuries from the drugs, many of which are similar in makeup to the drugs they mimic.Drug counterfeiting is different from the production of low-cost medicines. Some developing countries, as part of a principled stance in a broader public health debate, will allow their manufacturers to make certain generic medicines, for example, for AIDS patients, without paying license holders.Counterfeiters, in contrast, operate illegally for profit, and the contents of the fake drugs can be different from the originals.The variety of fakes range from crude mixtures of glue, chalk and sugar to nearly exact chemical replicas of complex pharmaceuticals, like Lipitor by Pfizer or the anti-impotence pill Viagra, both of which have been the targets of anticounterfeiting prosecutions.Counterfeiters operate in India, China and elsewhere. Russia’s underground prescription medicine market is distinguished for being at the forefront of a new trend of exceedingly high-quality fakes.Indeed, private investigators from Pfizer surveying the Russian market found fakes that were, by the company’s own admission, of exceptional quality.“The counterfeits we got in the survey were the finest counterfeits I’ve ever seen,” John Theriault, vice president for global security at Pfizer and a former F.B.I. agent, said in a telephone interview. “The stuff we saw in the Russian market wasn’t made in a garage. We don’t know where it was made.”If they are good enough, doctors and patients there may not suspect or notice they are using fakes any more than their Russian counterparts.“If the product looks like American product, how do you know where it came from?” he said. In a statement to Congress in July, the F.D.A.’s associate commissioner for policy and planning, Randall W. Lutter, said the quantity of counterfeit prescription drugs intercepted by customs officials suggest that such smuggling is on the rise. Agents opened 58 cases in the United States in 2004, up from 30 the previous year.Statistics on fake drugs are hard to come by. “The sophistication and precision of some counterfeit copies of legitimate drugs make a reliable estimate of the number of counterfeits impossible,” Mr. Lutter said, according to a transcript.The Coalition for Intellectual Property Rights, an independent group, surveyed the Russian market in 2003 and found that 12 percent of pharmaceuticals were counterfeited, though local industry groups say the number is lower, perhaps as little as a fraction of 1 percent.Typically, pharmaceutical trade associations, which represent companies with reputations and sales that could suffer if information on counterfeit products became public, offer lower estimates. The World Health Organization has estimated that counterfeiting pharmaceuticals, on a global basis, is a $32 billion business.Inside Russia, the high quality of the counterfeit drugs has blunted any sense of outrage or urgency by authorities to make arrests, according to two industry groups in Moscow.“There’s a perception around here that if nobody’s harmed, what is the problem?” said Sergei A. Boboshko, executive director of the Association of International Pharmaceuticals Manufacturers, an industry group in Moscow representing 46 large drug companies.The industry is more worried about publicity over counterfeiting, fearing that sales will fall if customers are alarmed by the prevalence of counterfeited medicine.Companies do not usually disclose their discoveries of counterfeit versions of their pills, according to Cinthya K. Ramirez, a policy analyst at the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and Associations, a group based in Geneva.“You can imagine the impact that it could have,” Ms. Ramirez said. “People would be scared and they won’t take their medicine, and would be ill. The question of information is very sensitive.”Industry groups like Mr. Boboshko’s and other authorities are also at odds over how to enforce the law; the Russian government has played up several high-profile raids on backyard medicine shops as talks continue about Russia’s entry into the World Trade Organization. Mr. Boboshko says the raids are merely window dressing because industrial scale producers continue to operate almost openly.Last fall, the Moscow police department’s 18-man economic crime squad broke down the door of a rented warehouse. They found a cat and a dog — along with eight illegal immigrants from Moldova who were mixing chalk and wheat flour into aspirin, Fillip A. Zolotnitsky, a spokesman for the economic crime division, said in a telephone interview.“The walls were covered with mold. It was a standard abandoned room,” Mr. Zolotnitsky said. The raid netted five million tablets packaged as aspirin. The suspects are awaiting trial. If they are convicted they could be sentenced to 10 years in prison. Meanwhile, Roszdravnadzor, the Russian equivalent of the F.D.A., recently published on its Web site penalties for licensed manufacturers who violate patents, including possible suspension of their license or a fine.The best counterfeits are made at legitimate plants, which might run an extra night shift to make fakes, according to Mr. Boboshko. Detectives tracing the trail of the Cavinton that turned up in Dr. Merkeshkin’s hospital were led to a Moscow warehouse registered to Tatyana Bryntsalova, the wife of Vladimir A. Bryntsalov, a pharmaceutical magnate who ran as a dark horse candidate for president of Russia in 2004, according to police records.Calls to Mr. Bryntsalov’s company, Ferein, were not returned. In the Russian media, he has denied wrongdoing. His company operates licensed factories that produce 10 percent of Russia’s legitimate pharmaceuticals.The growing proliferation of fake drug supplies around the world has led the F.D.A. to consider an expensive new radio tagging system for tracking prescription medicine in the United States. The system, now in a trial phase, is considered the most significant change in drug packaging since tamper-proofing was developed in the 1980’s.In a laboratory off Moscow’s traffic-clogged Leninsky Avenue, Leonid A. Mikhalitsyn, a physicist, stands at the industry’s front line against fakes. He is a spectrograph operator for the German scientific instrument maker Bruker and works in an ultramodern, glass-enclosed office. The spectrograph somewhat resembles a desktop PC with a round, pill-size scanner built into the top. It costs about $80,000 and is the gold standard for spotting counterfeit medicine.On a recent morning, Mr. Mikhalitsyn was testing Biseptol, the Russian trade name for a Polish-made antibiotic marketed in the United States as Bactrim. Mr. Mikhalitsyn said that the fake Biseptol was nearly impossible for a doctor or patient to tell from the real one and would work just as well. Bactrim is used to treat children’s ear infections and urinary tract infections, according to Jose F. Flores, an American internist at the SOS clinic in Moscow. While the counterfeit drug would not put patient’s health at risk, he said, it could put a drug maker’s profit at risk and undermine the incentive for research and development spending.On a Formica counter in Mr. Mikhalitsyn’s lab lay a Ziploc bag of tiny ampoules, along with stamps and labels certifying quality. The bags contained fake Cavinton found at the Moscow warehouse, from the same batch shipped to Mr. Merkeshkin’s hospital.After three minutes of examination, Mr. Mikhalitsyn had his answer.“It’s a fake,” he said, pointing to a red graph on his monitor depicting the chemical makeup of the pill. The computer screen displayed the readout from a genuine pill. The two lines nearly overlapped, which meant the chemicals were close to identical, Mr. Mikhalitsyn said.“They are either short one ingredient or have added an additional ingredient,” he said. “It’s really no different from the original.”'"
"'06-09-05,'1','Helmand’s descent symbolizes how Afghanistan has evolved since the initial victory over the Taliban into one of the most troubled fronts in the fight against terrorism.The problems began in early 2002, former Bush administration, United Nations and Afghan officials said, when the United States and its allies failed to take advantage of a sweeping desire among Afghans for help from foreign countries.The Defense Department initially opposed a request by Colin L. Powell, then secretary of state, and Afghanistan’s new leaders for a sizable peacekeeping force and deployed only 8,000 American troops, but purely in a combat role, officials said.During the first 18 months after the invasion, the United States-led coalition deployed no peacekeepers outside Kabul, leaving the security of provinces like Helmand to local Afghans.“Where the world, including the United States, came up short was on the security side,” said Richard Haass, the former director of policy planning at the State Department. “That was the mistake which I believe is coming back to haunt the United States now.”The lack of security was just one element of a volatile mix. Twenty years of conflict had shattered government and social structures in Afghanistan, the world’s fifth poorest country, where the average life expectancy is 43.American officials said the country was more destitute than they had envisioned, yet the $909 million they provided in assistance in 2002 amounted to one-twentieth of the $20 billion allocated for postwar Iraq. Officials quintupled assistance to $4.8 billion by 2005, but then reduced it by 30 percent this year.The Taliban leadership, meanwhile, found safe haven in neighboring Pakistan. And Robert Grenier, the C.I.A.’s former top counterterrorism official and Islamabad station chief, said Pakistani officials largely turned a blind eye to Taliban commanders, who later seeped back across the border.The government of President Hamid Karzai, hailed as Afghanistan’s eloquent new leader in 2001, has increasingly been criticized for indecisiveness, corruption and inaction.In Helmand, the absence of security and government control enabled the province to become the largest heroin-producing area in Afghanistan.By 2005, local Taliban fighters and drug traffickers had formed an alliance against the government. Today, the province’s educated elite accuses local officials of engaging in drug trafficking, and impoverished farmers say they grow poppy to survive.[Led by a 160 percent increase in Helmand’s opium crop this year, Afghanistan’s overall production grew by 50 percent to a record 6,100 metric tons, United Nations officials said Saturday. Afghanistan now produces 92 percent of the world’s supply of opium poppy, the basis for heroin.]Richard A. Boucher, the assistant secretary of state for South Asia, defended the pace of progress, saying expectations among Afghans and others that the war-ravaged country could be quickly rebuilt were unrealistic.“Afghan development is a long-term project, even without the security problem,” said Mr. Boucher. “Over all, I think it’s pretty incredible what we’ve accomplished.”Despite an active insurgency, he said, 1.6 million Afghan girls are attending school, 730 miles of roads and 1,000 schools, clinics and government buildings have been reconstructed, and the country has its first democratically elected president and Parliament.Bryan Whitman, a Pentagon spokesman, said that the recent surge in violence was the result of the Afghan central government and NATO exerting their authority in remote areas, prompting retaliatory attacks from the Taliban, drug traffickers and warlords.The return of more than three million Afghan refugees and the arrival of some foreign aid turned the country’s main cities into boom towns. But over time, the lack of construction in rural provinces fueled Taliban propaganda claims that Americans were enriching themselves and bringing only corruption to Afghanistan.In impoverished southern rural areas, small numbers of Afghans are openly collaborating with the Taliban. Other Afghans, who say they are unsure of the American commitment and disillusioned with Mr. Karzai, sit by and dare not resist them.Rauzia Baloch, a 33-year-old teacher, was one of a half dozen women elected to Helmand’s provincial council last year. In December, the American government sent her on a study tour of the United States that included visits to Congress and a domestic violence shelter in Phoenix, and Thanksgiving dinner with a family in Indiana.When Ms. Baloch returned to Helmand, she found the Taliban assassinating government officials.“I learned a lot, but unfortunately the situation is not the same as in America,” she said. “We cannot do anything.”During the cold war years in the Helmand Valley, amid a flat, barren landscape of reddish soil and black boulders, dozens of American engineers and their families carried out a sweeping project designed to develop impoverished southern Afghanistan and wean locals from Soviet influence.For more than three decades, the American government and Morrison-Knudsen, the firm that built the Hoover Dam, restored and expanded an ancient irrigation system. Its source of life, then and now, was the surging Helmand River, a finger of green that emerges from the mountains of central Afghanistan and snakes for hundreds of miles through the country’s vast southern desert.The project never irrigated as many acres as was hoped, but its training programs produced hundreds of American-minded Afghan engineers and technicians.“Most of them have lived and worked and studied in the United States; some have married American wives,” the British historian Arnold J. Toynbee wrote after visiting the area in 1960. “The new world that they are conjuring up out of the desert at the Helmand River’s expense is to be an America-in-Asia.”Among the young Afghans who were transformed in the process was Ms. Olomi, the women’s rights advocate. One of the first girls to attend the city’s new co-educational school, she also went on to become one of Helmand’s first woman to graduate from college.In a recent interview, Ms. Olomi, now 49, remembered only a handful of words in English. But she could still tick off the names of her American teachers and recite verses of “Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star” and “Puff the Magic Dragon.” After school, she recalled, she played a game called basketball with American children.“It was a very good time,” she said, eulogizing the functioning schools, clean streets and tranquillity of Lashkar Gah in the 1960’s and 1970’s. “I was very happy.”But her good fortune, like that of Lashkar Gah’s, would be short-lived. Americans abandoned the city just before the 1979 Soviet invasion. Twenty years of guerrilla and civil war ensued.By the early 1990’s, soldiers-turned-thieves roamed Lashkar Gah’s streets and warlords encouraged local farmers to grow opium poppies, the raw form of heroin.In 1994, residents welcomed the rise of the Taliban in Helmand’s remote villages and applauded when thieves had their hands chopped off on a local soccer field. Crime plummeted.For Ms. Olomi and other women, life fell apart. Her husband, who had gone to Russia to study medicine, never returned. Taliban religious police closed a girls’ school she had opened to support herself. Ms. Olomi, who had chosen her husband at the age of 25, watched helplessly as her daughter was forced by her husband’s brothers to marry a cousin at 13.Hopes rose again in 2001, when American bombs drove the Taliban from power in Afghanistan. Residents like Ms. Olomi said they dreamed of another American-backed renaissance.“At that time, we really felt so happy,” she said. “We felt that we were free now.”As expectations soared in Lashkar Gah and across Afghanistan, division emerged in Washington over what role the United States should play in rebuilding and securing the country.During meetings in January and February 2002, Robert Finn, the first American ambassador to post-Taliban Afghanistan, proposed that the United States undertake ambitious construction projects as a way to cement the loyalty of Afghans. Top among them was rebuilding a pulverized ring road linking Afghanistan’s major cities — a road Americans helped build during the cold war.“I argued for them to build the road and all I got was ‘no,’ ” Mr. Finn recalled. “It was just across the board in Washington: ‘We don’t do those kinds of projects anymore.’ ”Andrew Natsios, then the administrator of the United States Agency for International Development, the government’s main foreign development arm that had spearheaded the Lashkar Gah project years back, confirmed in an interview that he had opposed road building and other large construction projects.He said he feared they would consume too much of his agency’s limited budget and staff. Criticism of failed foreign projects and a drive to privatize aid work had shrunk the agency from 3,000 Americans posted abroad in the 1980’s to 1,000 today.In the end, the United States pledged $297 million in reconstruction money to Afghanistan in 2002. The European Union pledged $495 million. Japan gave $200 million and Saudi Arabia $73 million, but both were slow to deliver.When aid officials arrived in Kabul in late 2001, they were shocked by the country’s decrepit state. They had to build headquarters from scratch, they said, and contend with the lack of skilled Afghan workers. For remote areas like Helmand, it meant what assistance was available flowed in slowly.At the same time, Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld and Secretary Powell clashed over security issues, according to their aides.In a response to written questions, Mr. Powell said that in early 2002 he called for American troops to participate in the expansion of a 4,000-soldier international peacekeeping force designed to bolster Mr. Karzai’s fledgling government. Mr. Haass, the former State Department official, said informal conversations with European officials led him to believe the United States could recruit a force of 30,000 peacekeepers, half European, half American.Mr. Rumsfeld and his aides were skeptical. They feared European countries would not provide enough troops, according to Mr. Whitman, the Pentagon spokesman. Defense Department officials believed it was better to train local security forces.Over all, Pentagon officials hoped to minimize the number of American troops in the country to avoid stoking Afghans’ historic resistance to foreign occupation, said Douglas J. Feith, the former under secretary for policy.Ali Ahmed Jalali, the country’s interior minister from 2002 to 2005, said Afghan resentment of foreign peacekeepers was “a myth.” After 10 years of internecine civil war, he said, Afghans yearned for someone to step in.“They could not help themselves,” he said, referring to Afghans. “They were at war with themselves.”James Dobbins, then the administration’s special envoy to Afghanistan, said Mr. Powell was ultimately unable to win support from Mr. Rumsfeld and other senior administration officials.The 4,000-soldier international peacekeeping force would not venture outside Kabul. The United States deployed its 8,000 soldiers separately, but they focused on capturing or killing Taliban and Qaeda members, not on peacekeeping or reconstruction.As an alternative, officials came up with a loosely organized system designed to empower Afghans to secure the country. The United States would train a 70,000-soldier army. Japan would demobilize some 100,000 militia fighters. Britain would mount an antinarcotics program. Italy would carry out judicial reform. And Germany would train a 62,000-member police force.In April 2002, President Bush outlined his vision for rebuilding Afghanistan in a speech honoring George C. Marshall, the American general who led the rebuilding of postwar Europe.Mr. Bush said the history of military conflict in Afghanistan had been marked by “initial success, followed by long years of floundering and ultimate failure.” He vowed: “We’re not going to repeat that mistake.”On the ground in Afghanistan, problems arose immediately.When Mr. Finn, the ambassador, reviewed the first Afghan National Army troops trained by the Americans in the summer of 2002, he was dismayed.“They were illiterate,” he said. “They didn’t know how to keep themselves clean. They were at a much lower level than people expected.”American military officials told him that local Afghan commanders sent them their worst conscripts.Mr. Dobbins, the former special envoy to Afghanistan, said Defense Department hopes that Afghans could quickly take responsibility for their own security proved unrealistic.“The reason we are there is that these are failed states,” said Mr. Dobbins, who has also served as special envoy to Haiti, Bosnia and Kosovo. “The thought that this can be quickly remedied has proved unjustified in most cases.”The police were even more challenging. Seventy percent of the existing 80,000 officers were illiterate. Eighty percent lacked proper equipment and corruption was endemic. Afghan police did not patrol; they set up checkpoints and waited for residents to report crimes, with bribes often needed to do so.Yet in 2002 and 2003, Germany, the country responsible for police training, dispatched only 40 advisers. They reopened the Kabul police academy and began a program designed to graduate 3,500 senior officers in three years. German officials said developing a core of skilled commanders was the key to reform, frustrating American officials who backed a large, countrywide training effort. Some American and European military units conducted ad hoc training around the country, but no comprehensive instruction occurred outside Kabul.In Lashkar Gah, veteran policemen and judges who returned from living in exile during the reign of the Taliban were aghast at what they found. Only one-third of the province’s 3,000 policemen were, in fact, trained. The rest, including the provincial police chief, were former guerrilla fighters who punished members of other tribes and turned a blind eye toward rogues from their own.“They did not know about the law,” said Abdul Shakoor, a veteran police lieutenant. “They had their tribal ideas.”Abdul Waheed Afghani, then a 67-year-old retired judge who had been in exile in Saudi Arabia, said the judicial system was no better. When he looked for judges to send to each of the province’s 13 districts, he found only three people with judicial training. He asked for help from Kabul, but received no response.“I have given reports to many branches of the government,” he said. “But no one has helped me.”The only foreign troops to deploy in Helmand, a province twice the size of Maryland with a population of one million, were several dozen American Special Forces soldiers. They built a base in the center of the province in 2002, hired several hundred Afghan gunmen to protect them, and focused solely on hunting Taliban and Qaeda remnants, according to Afghan officials.Helmand Province’s voluble young governor, Sher Muhammad Akhund, was largely left to do as he pleased. The son of a famed local commander who fought the Soviets, Mr. Akhund entered Taliban-controlled Afghanistan in 2001 at Mr. Karzai’s request and won control of Helmand with the help of the Special Forces. Rumors abounded about the governor. In interviews with journalists, Mr. Akhund said he was in his early 30’s and a high school graduate. Afghan aid workers said he was in his late 20’s and illiterate.Whatever he may have lacked in administrative skills, he made up for in muscle. As the head of Helmand’s largest and most influential tribe, the Alizai, he commanded several hundred gunmen.As time passed, community leaders grew frustrated with Mr. Akhund. Haji Ahmad Shah, a wealthy local farmer, said Mr. Akhund initially refused to meet with him to discuss farmers’ problems. When he finally did, he ignored the complaints.“When I was sharing these problems with the governor, he didn’t do anything,” said Mr. Shah. “He was just working for his own benefit.”In 2003, Mr. Akhund confiscated 200 shops owned by a local minority group, according to a State Department report. Outside the city, the governor doled out parcels of land to his relatives and tribe, according to residents. Mr. Akhund denied the accusations.At the same time, reports began to reach Kabul that Mr. Akhund was promoting the growth of poppy, according to an American official who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the drug issue.After the fall of the Taliban, poppy growth had exploded in eastern and southern Afghanistan, fed by poverty, weak law enforcement and an epic, five-year drought.Mr. Akhund vehemently denied rumors that he took a cut of the poppy trade, but foreign officials remained skeptical. [On Saturday, Antonio Maria Costa, the executive director of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, blamed Mr. Akhund specifically for Helmand’s soaring poppy crop, saying there was evidence he encouraged farmers to grow opium poppies.]While corruption grew in Afghanistan, the Taliban regrouped in Pakistan and changed tactics, according to American officials. After being decimated in open battles with American troops through 2002, the Taliban began ambushing small groups of American soldiers and unarmed aid workers in 2003. Over time, aid groups scaled back or suspended reconstruction projects in the rural south and east.In March, a group of gunmen in Oruzgan Province pulled a foreign engineer out of a vehicle belonging to the International Red Cross, shot him in the head and back, and left his body in the dirt.Two days later, in a remote riverbed in northern Helmand, gunmen ambushed American Special Forces as they drove past in a small convoy, killing two soldiers. When their comrades stopped to return fire, the gunmen vanished down a maze of gullies.In the summer of 2003, officials in Washington unveiled an overhaul of American policy in Afghanistan.Until then, Americans had rebuilt the main highway linking Kabul and Kandahar, after initially rejecting the road proposal by Mr. Finn, the ambassador. Otherwise, Washington had shied away from large-scale projects like power plants.Between 2003 and 2004, American assistance to Afghanistan increased from $962 million to $2.4 billion; the Afghanistan staff of the United States aid agency doubled; and Washington dispatched an aggressive new ambassador, Zalmay Khalilzad.At the same time, the American military, expanding its role beyond combat, deployed eight new Provincial Reconstruction Teams, mostly to volatile southern and eastern Afghanistan. The units tried to win the loyalty of Afghans by equipping local government offices and mounting small reconstruction projects.Mr. Feith, the former Defense Department official, said progress was made in Afghanistan in 2002 and 2003, but that the disappointing results of the allies’ plan for training the police required an increased American effort.Former United Nations and State Department officials said the weakness in the Afghanistan policy should have been apparent to the administration much earlier. “It was possible in early 2002 and late 2001 to have calculated more accurately the manpower and money needs,” said Mr. Dobbins.In Helmand, a field commander in the new development effort was Charles Grader. The 72-year-old Massachusetts native was the last American to head the Afghanistan program before the 1979 Soviet invasion. Twenty-five years later, he was back, managing a $130 million United States government contract to revitalize agriculture and slow the growth of poppy.Mr. Grader was a marker of how the American approach to development had changed since the 1970’s. No longer a government worker, he was now a private contractor paid $130,000 a year by Chemonics International, a for-profit consulting firm based in Washington. Instead of directing projects, the United States aid agency hired companies like Chemonics, which farmed out work to subcontractors.In June 2004, Mr. Grader drove into Lashkar Gah with eight security guards and found a burgeoning city of 100,000 people that was a maze of new construction, shops and bustling open-air markets. But the prosperity was illusory. The boom was largely fueled by Helmand’s opium trade, which by then had been spreading across the province for two and a half years since the Taliban was defeated.On his first stop, Mr. Grader toured a demonstration farm bursting with cotton, pomegranates and other crops designed to show farmers they could make a legal living. Mr. Grader asked the Afghans who ran the farm what would persuade others to stop growing poppy.Their responses had little to do with agriculture. They said the biggest problem was poverty and corruption. Farmers, they said, no longer believed the government would punish them for growing poppy.“There is an inverse relationship between security and poppy growing,” said Abdul Ghani Ayubi, an engineer trained by the Americans in the 1970’s.A local farmer was more blunt. “We don’t have law. This is a warlord kingdom.”Mr. Grader promised to create public works projects that would repair the province’s irrigation system and employ large numbers of farmers. Four months later he resigned after clashing with aid agency officials over the direction of the program. High turnover rates among both aid agency officials and contractors slowed the American effort, according to Afghan and American officials.Some work did get under way, including repairs to the hydroelectric dam built by Americans during the cold war and an alternative-livelihoods program that put 37,000 Afghans to work cleaning hundreds of irrigation canals.A dozen new or refurbished health clinics were opened and over 100 wells were dug or deepened. The aid agency reported spending about $180 million in Helmand since 2001. In addition, the reconstruction of Afghanistan’s major highway included 90 miles in the province.But local officials said these projects did not provide enough jobs to counter the lure of growing opium poppies for Helmand’s 100,000 farmers.In addition, a popular perception took hold that after foreign contractors and subcontractors took their cut of aid money, little cash was left for average Afghans. And local residents grew suspicious of the foreigners who lived in heavily guarded compounds with electric generators and satellite televisions while they lacked regular running water and electricity.Aid agency officials defended their spending in Helmand, saying that foreign workers were needed to properly carry out the projects, train Afghans and prevent corruption.In October 2004, one of the eight new American military Provincial Reconstruction Teams arrived in Helmand. Over the next two years, the team spent $9.5 million to build, refurbish or equip 28 schools, two police stations, two orphanages, a prison, a hospital ward and 20 miles of roads.Just outside the American base, the United States built a women’s job-training center for Ms. Olomi to run. The Americans provided dozens of computers and sewing machines and even set up a mock beauty salon so women could learn marketable skills. On one wall are pictures of Laura Bush visiting Afghanistan and meeting with the country’s newly liberated women.By the spring of 2005, the stepped-up American effort in Helmand was showing signs of being overmatched by the rising violence. On a May morning, gunmen stopped a vehicle carrying five Afghans working on the program to clean irrigation canals. In broad daylight a few miles outside Lashkar Gah, they shot the workers dead.The following day, gunmen followed six relatives of one of the victims as they drove his body back to Kabul. Just off the main highway, they executed all six.Days later, the canal cleaning project — perhaps the Americans’ most successful undertaking in Helmand — was shut down over lack of security. Thousands of farmers were immediately out of work. Attacks also slowed repairs to the Kajaki dam.Security had emerged as the largest single impediment to developing Helmand, but the country’s nascent army and police force were unable to deliver it. The first units from the new, American-trained Afghan National Army arrived in Helmand in 2005, but they comprised only several hundred soldiers and carried out few operations, according to local Afghan officials. A new provincial antinarcotics force was created that year, but it consisted of just 30 officers.The long-delayed Japanese-led program to disarm militia fighters began in Helmand in 2005, but only several hundred assault rifles and machine guns were collected, according to the local police. Officials said vast numbers of weapons remain in Helmand and are being used by the Taliban and drug traffickers.Police training also continued to lag behind. After Germany failed to mount any training outside Kabul, the State Department hired DynCorp International, an Irving, Tex., firm, to recruit, train and deploy dozens of American police advisers in Afghanistan and build seven regional training centers.By mid-2004, the centers were operating two- to four-week training classes across Afghanistan. European officials said the training should be at least three months long, and one derided the classes as “conveyor-belt courses.”“I had 15 days’ training in Kandahar,” said Mr. Shakoor, the police lieutenant. “The things that they were teaching me I already knew.”Corruption was also undermining progress. A 28-year-old police recruit who asked not to be identified because he feared retaliation said he was disappointed when he returned from training to his district in Helmand. His commander continued to take 50 percent of his salary, he said, and work with drug traffickers.The United States, meanwhile, expanded DynCorp’s police training contract, increasing basic courses from two to eight weeks, and sent two DynCorp contractors to important provinces to serve as advisers. Two retired American sheriff’s deputies were sent to Lashkar Gah, to cover all of Helmand.Jesse Valdez, 55, from Santa Cruz, Calif., had trained police officers in Bosnia, Indonesia and the Philippines. Steve Rubcic, 58, from Wyoming, had never been east of Wisconsin.When they arrived in October, security was so bad they could not visit any of the province’s 13 districts. In interviews, both said the Afghan police were eager for help and that they were making progress removing corrupt officials. Six weeks after they arrived, a small car bomb detonated outside the governor’s office several minutes before they arrived for a meeting.In March, two more DynCorp advisers joined them in Lashkar Gah. A month later, a suicide car bomb attack flipped their armored vehicle, but they survived. Both refused to leave.In June, American officials dispatched an eight-man DynCorp “saturation” training team to Lashkar Gah. Brent Thompson, a 33-year-old former police officer from Dallas who heads the team, said American officials calculated that six Afghan policemen were dying for every soldier in the National Army who was killed.Half of the saturation team’s two-week training course is devoted to teaching Afghan police military skills, like how to launch or survive an ambush. Mr. Thompson, who trained the police in Iraq for DynCorp, said the Afghan police were more poorly equipped than their Iraqi counterparts. In one recent Afghan class, he said, 40 police officers shared 15 rifles.As of early July, the training segment that involved police firing their rifles was on hold. Security problems had delayed the delivery of ammunition to Lashkar Gah, according to Mr. Thompson.During the training, Afghan officers pull the triggers on their rifles and pretend to fire.On July 10, Helmand’s senior government officials, tribal elders and community leaders gathered for a public forum in Lashkar Gah entitled “Security, Reconstruction and Official Corruption.” For the next hour, the locals heaped scorn on the Afghan government. Speaker after speaker talked of dashed hopes.The leader of the newly elected provincial assembly said that “in a country where there is no security, there is nothing.” A teacher who had received death threats from the Taliban warned that Mr. Karzai’s government could collapse. An enraged tribal leader in a white turban said the police released the murderers of his sons and brothers after receiving bribes.“Is this a government?” he thundered. “Anyone other than me would join the Taliban.”This spring, American forces handed over responsibility for Helmand to the British military. More than 3,600 British troops, 10 times the troops the United States deployed in Helmand, now patrol the increasingly violent province. This year, 15 British and 4 American soldiers have been killed there.The violence has continued to hamper reconstruction. The canal cleaning project has resumed, but on a much smaller scale — and with many fewer local workers — than originally planned. Some road work is proceeding. But all repairs on the hydroelectric dam were suspended in July amid rising attacks. Nationwide, 90 percent of Afghans still lack regular electricity.Since early 2005, both Afghan and foreign officials had urged Mr. Karzai to remove Mr. Akhund as Helmand’s governor. Last December, Mr. Karzai finally did. The Afghan leader’s supporters argue that he was never provided with the resources needed to take on warlords.The new governor, an engineer and former United Nations employee, accepted the assignment on condition he have his own 150-man security force. This spring, Mr. Karzai fired the province’s police chief, but his replacement said he will make little headway stabilizing the province as long as the Taliban continues to have bases in neighboring Pakistan.Mr. Afghani, the province’s chief judge, said Taliban attacks this spring have shut down courts in 11 of the province’s 13 districts. In June, he found an unexploded bomb in his car. In July, a suicide bomber killed four people in a Lashkar Gah court office.“Nowadays, no one is taking care of judges in our government,” he said. “We are helpless people. We don’t have any power. We don’t have any police.”Mr. Shah, the farmer, said he has given up on Mr. Karzai’s government. After growing little opium since 2001, he grew large amounts this spring after his workers demanded higher pay. He and other farmers simply pooled their money and bribed a local official so that eradication teams drove past their village.On a recent afternoon, Ms. Olomi gave a reporter a tour of her women’s center, which was closed for security reasons after the killing of her driver in May. False rumors had been spread that the center’s female students were being taken to the local American military base and forced to have sex with soldiers.After the tour of the center, which had the feel of a museum, Ms. Olomi announced she was heading home and pulled out a burqa, the head-to-toe veil that became a symbol of Taliban oppression. Ms. Olomi shed her burqa after the group’s fall in 2001, but began wearing it again after her driver’s death to hide her identity from potential assassins.As her car rolled out the center’s front gate, Ms. Olomi pulled the burqa over her head and her face disappeared. In Little America in 2006, the former instrument of her oppression was her means of survival.'"
"'06-09-05,'1','The provision was inserted in the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 to win support from Democrats, who had complained that executives received lavish pay packages while citing a company’s financial distress as a reason to reduce the pay and benefits of ordinary workers. The provision is known to lawyers by the numbers of the two new sections, 503(c)1 and 503(c)2.In a submission to the court last week, the trustee defined the issue as raising the question of, “Can debtors circumvent the restrictions and evidentiary burdens enacted by Congress in sections 503(c)1 and 503(c)2 — provisions designed specifically to limit and restrict lavish insider retention and severance burdens — by avoiding the mere mention of the statute and transparently recharacterizing these payments as ‘incentive’ payments?”The trustee said she agreed with the criticisms of the pay plan for six top executives voiced earlier by lawyers representing the company’s unions and shareholders, as well as by lawyers for two groups of creditors.“At a time when the debtor’s work force faces great uncertainty and angst,” she wrote, the company “proposes to substantially insulate the six executives. It is exactly this type of managerial overreaching that led to the recent enactment of section 503(c), and exactly the type of insulation the statute is designed to prevent.”Dana has indicated it may seek to reduce health benefits for retired workers. But it has not sought wage concessions from those still at the company.Dana, which had not mentioned Section 503(c) in its original motion for approval of the pay plans, replied later in the week that the plan did conform to the law, and said that creditors and unions who opposed the plan were trying “to short circuit the business judgment of Dana” and “replace that fully informed and careful judgment with their own parochial interests.”The company argued that the opponents were seeking “a dangerously expansive and unworkable interpretation of Section 503(c).”The proposed contracts for Michael J. Burns, Dana’s chief executive since 2004, and five of his colleagues would give them large bonuses when the company emerges from bankruptcy, and could pay them additional bonuses based on the total value of the company’s securities six months after the bankruptcy is over.One of the issues is whether that amounts to a retention provision because the targets are sure to be met, as maintained by the opponents, or whether they are difficult targets, in which case they would be more easily characterized as performance bonuses, which are not barred by the new law.That has led to an unusual argument in which the company maintains that its securities are overpriced in the market, and that such trading values cannot be relied upon in assessing value. Instead, it uses an analysis that indicates the company is worth far less, based on multiples of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization at other auto parts companies. To justify the top bonus, it argues, the company’s cash flow would need to double or better from 2005 levels.Ms. Adams, the trustee, said “a consensus has emerged among the major constituencies that there is likely to be a confirmed plan with a substantial distribution to unsecured creditors, and perhaps a return to equity. Hence, the completion bonus cannot be characterized fairly as an ‘incentive’ bonus.”The company, in its filing, said there was no evidence to support such claims. It said there was “a substantial unlikelihood” that shareholders would get anything when the reorganization was completed.Dana’s securities performed well in the months after the company filed for bankruptcy in March. The stock, which traded for 66 cents on March 3, in the immediate aftermath of the filing, rose to as high as $3.52 in June. The company’s bonds also did well.The result was that the total value of the company’s securities rose from $2 billion, just before the filing, to $2.6 billion on July 13. The proposed pay package would give the executives their minimum bonus if the total value was at least $2 billion, and a maximum value if it was $2.6 billion or higher. Opponents say that plan means the executives get bonuses for accomplishing little, but the company disagrees.“The simple fact is that the proper standard by which to judge the appropriateness of executive compensation is not by tying it to distressed bond trading values, but rather by the business judgment of the debtors” and by the court’s determination of whether it complies with the law, Dana argued.Last week, as Dana was arguing that the stock price was too high, its shares fell. Dana stock, which has been delisted from the New York Stock Exchange and now trades on the over-the-counter bulletin board, fell 26 cents, or 14 percent, to $1.65. But Dana bonds showed little change for the week.The company argues that the plan is consistent with a pay plan that was approved by Judge Lifland for the Calpine Corporation after the new law took effect, and that other courts have also “exhibited deference to a debtor’s business judgment under Section 503(c),” as they had done under the previous law. It does not appear that any such plan has in the past been opposed by the trustee or appealed to higher courts, as could happen in this case.The trustee maintains that to some extent the new statute supplants previous practice and so the business judgment rule is no longer the primary determining factor of whether a pay plan should be approved.'"
"'06-09-05,'1','Hong Kong Disneyland missed its goal of 5.6 million visitors in its first year as the park had start-up problems while trying to attract tourists from mainland China, an executive said. The park has been extremely secretive about its attendance figures since it opened last Sept. 12. There has been wide speculation that it was struggling to meet its conservative attendance goal. Bill Ernest, the park’s managing director, said that Disneyland would meet its goal later in September or in early October. “We have well exceeded the five million figure already,” Mr. Ernest said, who declined to provide an exact figure. He said the attendance figure included people who visited the park using free or discounted tickets. The executive also would not provide specific information about revenue or net profit. “I think we are on solid financial footing,” he said. He acknowledged that Disneyland has had difficulty trying to figure out the mainland market. (AP)The country has tightened control on the inflow of funds to the real estate industry, requiring takeovers of developers to be paid for in full, the foreign exchange regulator said in a statement. Overseas companies cannot use installment payments for Chinese developers they buy, according to a statement on Web site of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange. China’s builders are also barred from borrowing from overseas institutions to buy or develop land if their capital is less than 35 percent of the total investment. The change is the latest effort by the government to curb lending as it tries to cool an economy that grew 10.3 percent in the first quarter and to prevent a drop in property prices from causing loan defaults. Overseas investors bought $4.5 billion of Chinese apartments, villas, offices and retail malls in the first quarter, 32 percent more than in all of 2005, according to DTZ Debenham Tie Leung, a London-based property adviser. (BLOOMBERG NEWS)Workers at Volkswagen’s largest plant in Brazil ended a strike after the company agreed to re-evaluate plans to cut 1,800 jobs, officials from the labor union at the factory and the automaker said. Production was returning to normal as representatives from both sides entered a new round of negotiations about the jobs. Workers at the São Bernardo do Campo car plant, which employs 12,000, went on strike last week after Volkswagen announced a round of layoffs and a possible plant closure. The plant’s workers account for more than half of the 21,000 people Volkswagen employs in Brazil.

The stake in the distributor, Eletropaulo Metropolitana Eletricidade de São Paulo, is worth 1.29 billion reais ($603 million), based on the Sept. 1 closing price. AES Transgas Empreendimentos, a unit based in São Paulo, will sell 13.76 billion preferred B shares of Eletropaulo this month, through a public offering, according to a statement filed with Brazil’s securities regulator. The share sale will enable AES to cover payments on $582 million of bonds the bank holds.

"'06-09-05,'1','Barlow has more than three times as many N.F.L. rushing yards as the other three candidates for the Jets’ starting position combined, but he has not grabbed the job.Barlow did not carry the ball in the Jets’ preseason finale Friday against Philadelphia. He gained 11 yards on 3 carries in the preseason with the Jets, far behind Cedric Houston (44 carries for 178 yards), Derrick Blaylock (25-93) and Leon Washington (20-59).Mangini said Monday that Washington, a fourth-round draft choice from Florida State, would be considered for carries — even though the competition was thought to have been among Blaylock, Houston and Barlow. Washington, who said that when he arrived in camp he thought there was “no light at the end of the tunnel,” has stood out on special teams.Barlow, in his sixth season out of the University of Pittsburgh, said he was not alarmed that he was not progressing as quickly as he wanted. The Jets’ offense is similar to the one used in San Francisco, he said, but he has had to learn a lot on the move.“They’re not going to throw a guy out there who doesn’t know the offense and can get the quarterback hurt,” Barlow said.That is especially true when the quarterback is Chad Pennington, who has had surgery on his shoulder twice and was not named the starter until last week. Barlow said he would have to be satisfied with receiving most of his work in practice.“You don’t want to be indecisive,” Barlow said. “The game is too fast to be indecisive.”Pennington said again Monday that he would miss Martin, in his 12th season, who is on the physically unable to perform list. But Pennington also said the other backs would have a chance to prove themselves.Barlow not only has 3,614 rushing yards and 24 touchdowns in his N.F.L. career, but he is also familiar with the Titans’ home stadium, which is a famously loud place. Barlow had 14 carries for 40 yards and a touchdown in the 49ers’ 33-22 loss to the Titans on Nov. 27.Barlow sprained his knee in practice the next week and played one more game before finishing the season on injured reserve.Barlow said he was healthy and invigorated. He would probably not be here if Martin had been able to play, but now he has Martin helping him become better, simply by watching film and asking questions.“I hope I’m ready,” Barlow said before quickly adding, “I think I’m ready to play, to contribute to a win.”'"

"'06-09-05,'1','The competition for leisure euros and dollars is fierce. Club Med and many of its competitors are chasing a demanding tribe of free-spending tourists in a global industry that is worth an annual $2.8 trillion, according to the latest data from the World Travel and Tourism Council. It is increasingly split between wealthy voyagers and middle-income travelers who are scrimping on their holiday budgets.“We have been through the effects of Afghanistan and Iraqi wars, the effects of SARS and the tsunami, so we have probably been through everything that nature and human beings can create,” said Henri Giscard d’Estaing, Club Med’s chairman since 2002 and a son of the former French president. “What’s important to understand is that what we are doing now is not a gimmick or marketing. It’s a deep change in the company.”Founded by Gérard Blitz, the son of an Antwerp diamond cutter, the resort started as a nonprofit organization and evolved into a publicly traded company that promoted a sunny singles culture of buffets, bead-necklace drink tokens and unlocked rooms.Eventually, Club Med started focusing on families, but its class system remained divided between the clients, known as the “gentils membres,” or G.M.’s; and the staff, known as “gentils organisateurs,” or G.O.’s, who approached their clients with an egalitarian spirit, sharing dinners, cocktails and occasionally beds.But that culture, which has been spoofed endlessly in French movies like “Les Bronzés,” is also undergoing refinement as part of the upmarket shift of Club Med, which is spending 100 million euros, or $128 million, annually through 2008 to upgrade its villages. It has renovated 70 villages from Mexico to Turkey, created 20 new ones like the Riad in Marrakesh and closed more than 50 sites, selling properties to reinvest in remodeling.Within its most luxurious new villages, it has established walled, first-class preserves of privilege for customers, nicknamed “pashas,” or pampered tourist royalty, who pay all-inclusive, individual rates up to 2,435 euros ($3,127) a week. That pays for expanded suites with living rooms, private gardens, room service, Internet connections and daily tea.The makeover also applies to Club Med’s culture. More than 27,000 employees on five continents are being groomed with lessons in fostering ambiance.Staff members do not tug clients from the first-class sections of the new Club Med into the pool for a spirited game of water gymnastics. The exclusive pashas’ pool is designated a quiet zone.“There was a time when guests were cooking and washing dishes together in the Baleares,” said Jean-Louis Dromas, a Club Med employee for 34 years who handles public relations for the company in Marrakesh, referring to the club’s original outpost on the Balearic Islands of Spain. “The club has evolved like the clientele, and you won’t find any guests washing dishes anymore.”Club Med’s shift from a high-volume approach to a “value strategy,” as the company calls it, was inspired by simple necessity. With international tourism companies experiencing a wave of consolidation from 2001 to 2004, it steadily lost clients. The number plummeted 23 percent from 2001, to 1.37 million last year. Twenty of its villages closed after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.Various studies, including a survey by Ipsos, the global market research firm, that was commissioned by Club Med, indicate that wealthy travelers are more resilient than travelers at the lower end, increasing their spending on holidays even during economic and political crisis.“Club Med is going to bring new customers by moving upscale,” said Gilles Raffort, an equity analyst with Fortis in Paris, “but it will take time.”He cautioned that the company’s financial resources would remain vulnerable to tourist cycles and natural disasters, and noted that one of its major shareholders, the hotel chain Accor, recently reduced its stake in the company to 6 percent, from 28.9 percent.The competition for the luxury market is also intensifying, Mr. Raffort added, as a range of rivals is emerging.For example, Starwood Capital, the United States investment fund, recently announced plans for a new international brand, Le Crillon, a chain of luxury five-star hotels named after the historic Hôtel de Crillon in Paris that it bought in 2005. Its aim is to capitalize on the brand, building upscale hotels in major business cities and winter resorts and seashore resorts.Stephen M. Case, the former chairman of AOL Time Warner, is also investing in high-end vacations with the creation this year of Revolution Resorts, which runs Miraval spa, a resort in southern Arizona where rooms cost $735 a night, and Exclusive Resorts, a luxury vacation club.The vice chairman of Revolution Resorts is none other than a former Club Med chief executive, Philippe Bourguignon, who left the company in December 2002 after also promising a cultural revolution.He planned a strategy of mass appeal to reduce prices and make the club more accessible to a broader group of vacationers. But that foundered in the fallout of Sept. 11, as the company suffered from a steep and lingering downturn. It lost 94 million euros ($121 million) in 2003 before finally making a profit last year of 4 million euros ($5 million) on revenue of 1.6 billion euros ($2 billion).The number of United States tourists at Club Med also steadily declined during that period by 23 percent, to 137,000 visitors last year.In its latest financial report in June, Club Med had some better news to deliver: French tourists were starting to return after a stepped-up advertising campaign. The vast majority matched the desired profile of a high-spending tourist from the top fifth income rank.For the “chefs de village,” who preside over Club Med’s newly renovated resorts, the orders from the Paris headquarters are simple: emphasize refinement without losing the club’s historic spirit of conviviality.Gone are the Elvis Presley impersonators who serenaded guests at lower-scale Club Med resorts. In their place are gowned women in glittering Venetian masks who welcome guests for Italian soirées. Tennis and golf are still standard club activities. But the staff members, which Club Med now calls “maîtresses de maison,” are also offering singing lessons, makeup classes and Moroccan cooking tips.Salverio Friselli, the chef de village for Club Med in Marrakesh, plays host to a weekly event that encapsulates the club’s new discreet style: a starlight garden party with guests dressed totally in white. The tranquil approach is something people are yearning for, he said. “We’re completely booked,” Friselli said, while sitting near the Riad’s officially designated quiet pool.Largely through word of mouth, he said, the 60-suite first-class section was completely occupied through most of the year.The club is also developing a new business class with computer rooms and conference space within walking distance of the pools.The personal reviews have been excellent, despite some wistful yearning for the old free-wheeling Club Med style, according to employees.Piet Jan Slot, a Dutch tourist who stayed at the Riad in August for the first time with his son, said that in some ways he considered the new Club Med system better than a five-star palace. “The rooms are spacious,” he said, “and if you ask for anything they never make a face like they do at some hotels. They always help.”Marilyn Carruthers, a Belgian guest, stayed in Club Med’s lower-priced outer ring of smaller rooms beyond the walled Riad. She said that she was satisfied with the improvements but joked that other visitors had warned her to avoid the nouveau riche in the higher-end Riad.“The quality of this Club Med is so much better and the people are really nice,” she said, reserving one mild complaint that probably speaks to the transformation of the club’s once-vaunted nonstop party culture.“They should have more bottled water available for everybody,” she said. “Not everyone drinks wine or beer.”'"
"'06-09-05,'1','“We’re not saying all of Lewiston is part of this,” said Imam Nuh Iman, leader of the mosque, the Lewiston-Auburn Islamic Center. “But this is the biggest impact you can have on a mosque, in the time of praying, to put in a pig’s head. It could have been a goat’s head, or a cow’s head. But it was a pig’s head.”Phil Nadeau, the assistant city administrator, believes the incident was isolated but underscored the growing pains this city — whose mills and shoe factories, now closed, welcomed French-Canadian workers a century ago — is now going through.“I think it’s a reflection of where we are right now. There’s a small group of people that will never accept this type of change in their community, ever,” said Mr. Nadeau, whose French-Canadian grandmother spoke only five words of English. “The second wave of non-English speakers to Lewiston is now the Somali population.”Hussein Ahmed, 31, said the mosque incident came as Somalis here felt that they had finally started to move on from a 2002 open letter written by Laurier Raymond, then the mayor, which asked them to stop other Somalis from coming to the city. Mr. Raymond contended in his letter that the city was “maxed-out financially, physically and emotionally.”Somali leaders quickly condemned Mr. Raymond after the letter, saying he was “bent toward bigotry.” Mr. Raymond met with Somali leaders but did not apologize. Three months later, a white supremacist group held a rally in Lewiston but was overshadowed by a counter-rally that drew 4,500 people.The incident with the pig’s head brought a similar response. About 150 people, including Gov. John Baldacci, a Democrat, and leaders of other faiths, gathered at a park shortly after the incident to condemn it and to support the Somali community.“After we heard about what happened at the mosque, many of us in the local interfaith clergy group felt that an attack on anybody’s house of worship is an attack on all houses of worship,” said Rabbi Hillel Katzir of Temple Shalom Synagogue Center in nearby Auburn. “This is not O.K. This is not approved of by the majority of the community. He might think it’s funny, but the rest of us don’t, and it’s not acceptable.”Mr. Ahmed, who spoke at the rally, said it affirmed his trust in residents of Lewiston. “The message was clear: they don’t tolerate hate,” he said.Mr. Nadeau said that Somalis continued to flock to Lewiston, about 30 miles north of Portland, and that the city was struggling to find jobs for them. The city is also trying to educate residents about the Somali culture and Islam.“There’s still a kind of unknown element relative to people’s familiarity with their culture and religion that is still being felt, even to this day,” Mr. Nadeau said.Mr. Matthews’s lawyer, James Howaniec, said his client had intended to play a prank. Mr. Howaniec said Mr. Matthews got the head from a pig roast in June and had originally planned to use it for target practice. Mr. Matthews then decided to plant it outside the center, thinking it was simply a gathering place, the lawyer said.“He did not know it was a place of worship,” Mr. Howaniec said. “There’s certainly nothing in the exterior of the dilapidated storefront that would lead anyone to believe it was a place of worship. He is insistent that he did not know the significance of a pig’s head to the Muslim community.”Mr. Howaniec said that Mr. Matthews was trying to create a disruption at the center, but that it was not a crime.“It’s our position that while it was an act of stupidity, it did not rise to the level of any sort of crime, let alone a hate crime,” Mr. Howaniec said. “It’s clearly not something he’s proud of, but as an attorney looking at criminal statutes, I don’t think it rises to the level of desecration of a place of worship.”Judge Ellen Gorman of Androscoggin County Superior Court on Aug. 31. granted the state’s request for a temporary injunction, ordering Mr. Matthews to stay 150 feet from the mosque.At the hearing Mr. Matthews said that he had planned to put the head outside “where the dark people congregate” as a joke, and that it had slipped from his hand and rolled inside. He said he felt bad about the incident and wished he “could turn back time.”Mr. Matthews will be indicted on criminal charges Sept. 6, and Mr. Howaniec said he was expecting a jury trial. If convicted, Mr. Matthews could face up to a year in jail on the desecration charge and up to $5,000 in fines.Imam Iman said he wanted his worshippers to feel comfortable where they lived.“Most people feel welcome,” the imam said, “but after these incidents, not at all. Mainers have to understand that this is the new Maine.”'"
"'06-09-05,'1','WASHINGTON, Sept. 4 — A District of Columbia Superior Court judge has shelved efforts by Airbus to disqualify lawyers for the Boeing Company from working on a contentious trade dispute.Airbus had filed a complaint against Boeing’s use of the law firm of Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale & Dorr for work related to a dispute with the World Trade Organization. The complaint said Boeing would have an unfair advantage because Wilmer Hale employed a former United States trade representative, Charlene Barshefsky, and a former internal lawyer for Airbus, Marco C. E. J. Bronckers, who is now a partner in Wilmer Hale’s office in Brussels.Boeing and Airbus are involved in a long-running trade dispute over civil aircraft subsidies, currently the subject of W.T.O. cases filed by the United States and the European Union. Litigation is under way and could reach a conclusion late next year if the two sides do not negotiate a settlement by then.The United States wants Europe to stop giving subsidized development loans as launch aid to Airbus. Europe has countered that the United States should acknowledge and curtail tax breaks, research contracts and other government aid to Boeing.But Judge Leonard Braman threw out half of the Airbus complaint at an Aug. 17 hearing. He put the other half on hold, pending developments in World Trade Organization litigation.At the hearing, Judge Braman dismissed the complaint against Ms. Barshefsky. He said Airbus did not have standing to complain about her involvement with Boeing because the court was not handling any other aspect of the trade battle.'"
"'06-09-05,'1','BARCELONA, Spain, Sept. 4 — The booming market for drug-coated stents is encountering questions from heart specialists about the devices’ long-term safety.Controversy about the tiny, wire-mesh tubes used to prop open clogged arteries has been fueled by studies being discussed at the World Congress of Cardiology here, with suggestions that they carry a higher risk of potentially fatal blood clots than older, bare-metal stents.Drug-coated stents are now used in more than 90 percent of procedures in advanced economies like the United States and Switzerland. But some cardiologists say they will be more cautious about their use in the future.Dr. Gabriel Steg, of the Bichat-Claude Bernard hospital in Paris, said on Monday that “it raises the flag of caution over the indiscriminate use of first-generation, drug-eluting stents and reminds us that we should stick with tested indications and not overextend this to any patient.”Dr. Steg was an author of a Swiss study underlining the risks of coated stents. He also heads the public relations committee of the European Society of Cardiology, one of the sponsors of the congress, which opened Saturday and runs through Wednesday.'"
"'06-09-05,'1','So far, at least 57 companies have been sued in this way; some 15 class-action securities cases have been filed.Proponents argue that the derivative lawsuits give shareholders a chance to force changes at the company, but critics counter that they do little more than produce fees for lawyers.“These are classic examples of the entrepreneurial spirit of the plaintiffs’ bar,” said Robert J. Giuffra Jr., a defense lawyer at the firm of Sullivan & Cromwell. “Many derivative lawsuits are nothing more than efforts by attorneys who are motivated by the desire to generate fees.”Plaintiffs’ lawyers, however, say that these suits let shareholders weigh in on a much larger issue: excessive executive compensation.“You can go in and do the job that the board is not doing,” said Gerald H. Silk, a partner in the plaintiffs’ firm of Bernstein Litowitz Berger & Grossmann. “You can rescind the options contracts and go after the proceeds, bringing the money back into the corporate treasury.”Among plaintiffs’ lawyers, the competition over who will pursue these cases has been fierce. The suits are a throwback to the days when lawyers raced to the courthouse with an individual plaintiff in tow and tried to outmaneuver one another to reach a quick settlement with a company’s board. Many of the rules that govern class-action lawsuits do not apply, particularly ones that favor institutional investors.“A one-share plaintiff, if represented by a powerful law firm, may be able to hold on to control of the case,” said John C. Coffee Jr., a law professor at Columbia University. “One of the defensive strategies when you have a messy situation is to seek a quick but reclusive settlement with a friendly law firm.”While legal fees are typically low in derivative suits, there have been a handful of cases where plaintiffs’ lawyers walked away with millions.Lawyers who filed a derivative suit involving accusations of insider trading by Lawrence J. Ellison, the chief executive of Oracle, received more than $22 million in fees and expenses for brokering an unusual settlement, which included Mr. Ellison making a $100 million contribution to charity.Kevin M. LaCroix, a director of OakBridge Insurance Services, which sells executive liability insurance to corporations, remarked: “Whereas historically there would be no expectations for large, shareholder-derivative settlements, clearly something has changed in the last 24 months. There may be the opportunity in some of the more egregious cases of option backdating for lawyers to get a larger amount of money in a settlement.”Part of the growing interest in derivative suits may result from the fact that business, and fees, are down. Securities class-action lawsuit filings have fallen 31 percent from last year’s pace, according to a midyear report released late in July by the Securities Class Action Clearinghouse at Stanford University Law School, in cooperation with Cornerstone Research.The study, which did not include derivative lawsuits, said the number of class-action filings — 61 new cases — was the lowest in 10 years. Lawyers expect few additional class-action suits resulting from the matter of stock options, mostly because much of the backdating in question occurred in the early- or mid-1990’s, and the statute of limitations might have run out.Also, said Melvyn I. Weiss, a founding partner of the firm of Milberg Weiss Bershad & Schulman, to file a federal class-action suit, lawyers have to show that shareholders lost money as a result of the backdating.“A lot of these stocks aren’t reacting with big drops in price,” Mr. Weiss said. “Or, if they drop initially, they come back over a short period of time.”Milberg Weiss, which has been a leading force in securities litigation, is operating under a cloud since it and two of its name partners were indicted in May and accused of secretly paying plaintiffs. Mr. Weiss said the firm was currently involved in only one derivative action against a company accused of manipulating option grants.Gaining traction in derivative suits is not easy, lawyers said, as suits can be sidetracked by the company, or by the court.Four plaintiffs and their lawyers reached a settlement more than three weeks ago with directors of Brocade Communications Systems, only to run into problems in getting approval by the federal judge overseeing the case.Brocade’s directors had agreed with the plaintiffs and their lawyers to corporate governance changes and a payment of $525,000 in legal fees. (The former chief executive, Gregory L. Reyes, was not included in the settlement.)But Judge Charles R. Breyer, in San Francisco, criticized the settlement when it was presented to him.“You have item after item after item of malfeasance by all these defendants — then it’s sort of a Roseannadanna situation: ‘Oh, never mind,’ ” Judge Breyer told lawyers at a hearing. “You haven’t presented to me anything other than the lawyers’ saying we think this is a good deal.”The group said it planned to present more details of the settlement to the judge in mid-September and seek his approval then.One lawyer involved in the proposed Brocade settlement said the group had proposed meaningful corporate governance changes for company directors, attributing criticisms of the settlement to competition in the industry.“The goal of a derivative action is not the lawyer’s personal greed being satisfied,” said William Federman, a lawyer in Oklahoma City whose firm is also involved in a dozen other derivative suits involving accusations of options backdating. “A lot of these law firms, particularly the younger ones that have no trial experience, may not realize that who they represent is the corporation and the result is supposed to be fair.”Mr. Federman added, “The firms are competing more over their own attorney fees than actually trying to do something that benefits the corporation.”'"
"'06-09-05,'1','Eating a high-fat meal has a negative health effect that can be immediately measured: it lowers flow mediated dilation — the ability of blood vessels to expand and contract in response to increased blood flow. But a small study suggests that there is a way to counteract the effect: vigorous aerobic exercise within two hours of the meal.In previous studies, researchers have found that blood vessel function is impaired for up to six hours after a high-fat meal, with the peak of dysfunction occurring about four hours after eating. This postprandial effect is a significant risk factor for cardiovascular disease.In this study, which appears online in The European Journal of Applied Physiology, researchers tested eight healthy 25-year-olds. First, the subjects ate a no-fat 945-calorie breakfast and did no exercise afterward. A few days later, they ate a 940-calorie meal with 69 grams of fat. Again, they did not exercise. Finally, they ate the same high-fat meal, but two hours later they did a brisk 45-minute walk on a treadmill. Flow mediated dilation was measured before and four hours after each regimen.Unsurprisingly, flow mediated dilation was significantly lower after the high-fat meal. But when subjects exercised after the high-fat meal, the dilation was even higher than after the low-fat meal.Janet P. Wallace, a professor of kinesiology at Indiana University, was the study’s lead author. She and her fellow authors acknowledge that the study sample was limited to eight healthy young adults. But the effect was statistically highly significant, suggesting a meaningful treatment effect.'"
"'06-09-05,'1','“The Brave One,” produced by Joel Silver, the emperor of the “Matrix” franchise, began life as a straightforward genre project. The script, a spec job by Roderick and Bruce A. Taylor, a father-son team who have had most of their success writing for television, bounced around for a while until it caught Ms. Foster’s eye.“I don’t work that much,” she said between takes on the set. “I have a big, full life, and you have to drag me away from it. So a movie has to be fairly special to get me interested, and it’s uncommon that something comes along more than once every three years or so.”What originally appealed to her about “The Brave One,” she added, was a “beautiful strain of an idea.” “It’s about a very true human phenomenon,” she said. “Someone who’s been dealt a terrible blow and then reacts. Traditionally, when we see this happen with women, they turn it all inside. They allow themselves to be abused or they become alcoholics. But what if they turned it back outside — you know, ‘I’ll get you back’? Ultimately the revenge plot became a way of getting into something that was very character driven.”The director of “The Brave One” is Neil Jordan, an Irishman hardly known for genre movies. But after seeing a version of the script that had been rewritten by Cynthia Mort, he said he felt much the way Ms. Foster had.“ I usually prefer to do my own stuff,” he said, waiting for the crew to set up a shot in which the teenage prostitute is run over. (The stuntwoman, Chrissy Weathersby, has been in the business for five years but had never been hit by a car and was nearby, nervously stuffing her pants with padding.)“I read the script, and I put it down,” Mr. Jordan said. “I thought, This isn’t the kind of thing I really do. But then I kept picking it up again. It was very basic, but there was something compelling there in this urge for revenge and reflection. It’s a very American movie, a little like Don Siegel and Sam Fuller, a driving narrative that hits somewhere between psychology and myth. There’s the awfulness of what she’s doing. You don’t want her to go there, and yet you understand it, and you can’t stop watching.”About directing Ms. Foster, he said: “It’s like working with a Stradivarius. Here you have this incredibly accomplished actress who also has the whole iconic thing going.”Ms. Foster, for her part, said she didn’t see much similarity between Erica Bain and the other characters she had played recently. “The women in ‘Panic Room’ and ‘Flightplan’ were a lot alike, I admit,” she said. “But ‘Inside Man’? I think that was very different, and so is this one.“If the idea is just that I take action, you could say that about Mel Gibson and Harrison Ford. What is usual, I guess, is that all these movies could have been about men, and I’m a woman. But it’s not as if I’m playing a Navy Seal. It’s not an attempt at pre-empting a male domain.”In the original script Erica Bain was supposed to be, of all things, a reporter for The New York Times, and Ms. Foster, who confessed to being a “serious N.P.R.-head” — the sort of person who will sit in her garage listening to the car radio until a show is over — changed her to the host of a public radio show.The character is a sort of elegist for the city, Ms. Foster explained, someone who will find the connection between, say, Weegee and Sid Vicious, and is also meticulous about searching out oddball characters and recording the sounds of the city.“For me what’s so fascinating is that she is someone who has practically lost her body,” Ms. Foster said. “She’s in danger of becoming just a voice. And the movie is partly about her finding the power of her body again by being the one who can cause life and death. A little twisted, but to me it’s very moving.”As the scene in the pimp’s car evolved over many takes and two nights of shooting, the character also became tender and even sexy. Responding to a suggestion from Victor Colicchio, a journeyman actor playing the pimp, Ms. Foster upon entering the car improvised a line about putting on “a show in the back seat,” and then comforted the prostitute (played by Lenny Kravitz’s 17-year-old daughter, Zoe) in a way that, seen in the rear-view mirror, could be misinterpreted as lovemaking.“It’s very maternal and very sensual,” Ms. Foster said of the scene.Mr. Colicchio said: “It was amazing that Jodie would be so interested in my issues, and that she brought so much to the scene. And the director has been so open too. Neil asked me about everything. Did I like the dice on the mirror? Which shirt did I want to wear? That’s something that for an actor at my level almost never happens.”It was by then 3 in the morning, and the sound of sirens came whooping briefly from the direction of the Bronx. The weather had finally turned cooler, and an assistant slipped a cardigan over the shoulders of Ms. Foster, who though she wasn’t needed for a bit, seemed reluctant to head back to her trailer.“I love shooting at night,” she had said the evening before. “You have the day to go to the gym, take care of your dry cleaning, but you don’t have to do lunch or go to dinner, any of that social stuff. It’s an excuse to cut yourself off from the world and focus on what you’re doing.”'"
"'06-09-05,'1','A significant number of deaths and serious side effects could result from a mass smallpox vaccination program, according to a newly published analysis of historical data, and the exact numbers might depend on the strain of virus used to make the vaccine.The smallpox vaccine is a pure preparation of live vaccinia virus, a germ similar to cowpox and smallpox, and there are several different types. The United States stockpiles a strain called New York City Board of Health, or N.Y.C.B.H., while most European countries have stocks of the Lister strain.Complications from the smallpox vaccine are not common, and deaths are rare. But of the two strains generally stored today, N.Y.C.B.H. is considerably safer than Lister, researchers say. While new and presumably safer vaccines are under development, there is no way to know their side effects until they have been used in a large vaccination campaign.The study appears online in the August issue of PLoS Medicine.In 1968, the World Health Organization recommended that either the Lister or the New York strain be used exclusively for the worldwide eradication campaign that ended in 1979.“People in the U.S. can count themselves lucky that they live where a less pathogenic strain of vaccinia is used,” said Mirjam Kretzschmar, the lead author of the study. The Lister strain, she said, is still used in Europe only because the stockpiled virus was easily available as seed virus for new vaccine production.'"
"'06-09-05,'1','Humor genes could have been lost. Or, the capacity for humor may not have evolved in animals like dogs and primates until long after they diverged from cats. But this was not the reason I decided to tackle the cat/humor issue again. A colleague and friend who had a dry, slightly wicked sense of humor and who loved and identified with his cats — he was known to meow on occasion — died unexpectedly. I thought, how could he have been enamored of an animal that does not have a sense of humor?So I began to rethink the issue, and I have concluded that I may have actually been thinking about laughter rather than humor.Laughter is not always about what’s funny, as Robert R. Provine, a professor of psychology at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, who has studied laughter, has noted in books and articles. It is frequently a social behavior unrelated to jokes or wit. It can serve different purposes. It can be friendly or submissive, hostile or dominant. Witness the old distinction between laughing with and laughing at someone.This makes sense when you think that some of the people who laugh all the time are actually not funny, or even appreciative of a good joke. They just laugh to punctuate conversation, or sometimes to seem unthreatening. Or threatening — I know those people, too.Perhaps, I thought, this is what dogs and other social creatures have, not a sense of humor, but an “I’m just happy to be part of the pack/team/company” sense of laughter. You know when your dog lies on its back, looking goofy, with the tongue falling out one side of its mouth? Just think of that as laughing.I love dogs. But if I think about dog humor honestly, it’s really a kind of goofy, good-natured submissiveness.Dogs amuse us. Cats, I suspect, amuse themselves, as a creature unconcerned about its place in the corporation might well do. With a mouse, or a ball of yarn, a cat may play and be amused, whether we are watching or not.Obviously, this can be solved only by mining the genomes of dogs, cats and people. Most of the detailed DNA research on humor so far has to do with the aqueous humor or the vitreous humor. Those are in the eye and, from my brief survey of the literature, are not at all funny.There is, of course, a school of thought that a sense of humor in humans is not genetic, but depends on one’s upbringing. This may be true within species, but I’m thinking it doesn’t apply in cross-species studies. However, if cats or dogs have a true capacity for humor, as opposed to some version of social laughing, they may well acquire their taste in humor from their owners.So, I’m now prepared to acknowledge that some cats may have a sense of humor. Very dry and slightly wicked, I’ll bet.'"
"'06-09-05,'1','Having a dog in the house may worsen the symptoms of children with asthma by aggravating their response to air pollution, but living with cats has no detectable effect, a new study reports.Researchers recruited 3,227 children, of whom 475 had asthma, from schools in 12 California communities. They completed health questionnaires and were followed over three years. The study appears online in Environmental Health Perspectives.The subjects reported yearly information on chronic cough and other lung symptoms. The questionnaires also included information on socioeconomic status, pet ownership and a history of asthma in either parent.Dogs were present in 62 percent of the houses and cats in 43 percent. Using data from air pollution monitoring stations in each community, researchers found that the association of air pollution with asthmatic symptoms was consistently larger in children who lived with dogs. There were no statistically significant effects in houses with cats alone or with no pets.The cause of the effect is not clear. “We think it’s probably not allergy to dogs, otherwise we would expect to see an effect of air pollution with cats,” said Dr. Rob S. McConnell, the lead author of the study and professor of preventive medicine at the University of Southern California. “It’s the synergy between air pollution and dogs that makes the story.”But it may not yet be time to give away the dog.“It’s premature to advise people to get rid of a dog on this basis,” Dr. McConnell said. “We need to understand what it is about dogs that results in this triggering effect. And each child is different.”'"
"'06-09-05,'1','Taking aspirin every day may lower the risk for prostate enlargement, a new study has found. Other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or Nsaids, like naproxen (Aleve) or ibuprofen (Advil or Motrin), have the same effect.“At least half the patients I see are taking a daily aspirin for other health reasons,” said Dr. Michael M. Lieber, an author of the study and a Mayo Clinic urologist. “So this is a possible fringe benefit.”Researchers studied 2,447 men over 12 years, examining them every other year. After adjusting for age, diabetes, hypertension and other factors, men who took a daily aspirin or another Nsaid reduced their risk of moderate or severe urinary symptoms by 27 percent, and their risk of an enlarged prostate by 49 percent. Moreover, they had a 48 percent reduced risk of having an elevated level of prostate-specific antigen, or P.S.A., the protein measured in a common blood test for prostate cancer.The study, published online by The American Journal of Epidemiology, had limited data on dosage, but scientists believe that even low doses of anti-inflammatory drugs reduce the risk of urological problems.Dr. Lieber acknowledged that the study was observational and not a placebo-controlled trial. Still, he said, he was impressed. “We were pretty surprised by the strong association with objective things like the 49 percent reduction,” he said.'"

"'06-09-06,'0','Take our No. 1 white wine, for example, a 2005 grüner veltliner from E & M Berger in the Kremstal region of Austria. This $10 bottle — that’s $10 for a liter — was fresh and expressive, with citrus, floral and mineral flavors that linger in the mouth. It practically invites you to have a second glass. Is it the best grüner veltliner that you will find? Of course not. This wine doesn’t have the pronounced peppery quality that is typical of a really good grüner veltliner, nor is it complex. But it is refreshing, and it makes a definite case for its place on the table.So does our No. 2 white wine, a 2004 Saint-Véran from Domaine Delaye. It, too, had a pronounced freshness, like one of those cartoon pies sitting on a windowsill, where the aroma rises up, snatches you by the nose and pulls you in. It’s a chardonnay, but without the oak trimmings. Simply a crisp, clean, modest wine that doesn’t intrude with pretensions.In a similar tasting last year, the white wine category was dominated by sauvignon blancs. We had fewer in the tasting this year, and only one made our top five, a balanced, inviting 2005 Pascual Toso from Mendoza in Argentina. Even so, I think sauvignon blanc — from France, New Zealand, South America, South Africa — remains a reliable area to explore in this price range. The pungent personality of the grape shines through, and the wines often have a force that is too often lacking otherwise.Another approach is to look for wines made from unusual, offbeat grapes, like our No. 3 white, a 2004 from Cusumano in Sicily that goes by the proprietary name Angimbé. This wine is 70 percent insolia, an obscure Sicilian grape, and 30 percent chardonnay. It had a rich texture and the sort of exotic coconut and tropical fruit character that reminded me of a white Rioja.Inexpensive white wines have an advantage over their red counterparts. As with a mass-market lager beer, if you serve a white wine cold enough, it will at least quench a thirst. Red wines can’t hide in the ice bucket, though truth be told, a slight chill can enhance many reds. Our No. 1 red wine is the 2004 Perrin Réserve Côtes-du-Rhône, from the family that owns Château de Beaucastel, the esteemed Châteauneuf-du-Pape. Humble Côtes-du-Rhône used to be the house wine in countless Paris cafes and bistros, until it got too expensive. But this $9 one recalls the honest character of many of those wines, with its dark, earthy fruit flavors and lively acidity.By comparison, the 2005 Robert Mondavi Private Selection pinot noir is a surprise as our No. 2 red wine. Pinot noir is hard to produce cheaply, yet here’s a $9 bottle that’s not bad at all. In fact it’s quite pleasing, with a light texture and straightforward raspberry and anise flavors, and it’s dry on the palate.Inexpensive Napa Valley cabernet sauvignon is thought to be an oxymoron, but the 2003 Pavilion cabernet was a real eye-opener at $10, dry with dark fruit flavors supported by light tannins. It’s the kind of wine that you don’t see every year, but when the supply of grapes is greater than the demand, you can sometimes find deals like this.Spain and Italy remain superb sources for inexpensive bottles. Valpolicella was once a synonym for bad cheap wine, but the appellation has rebounded in the last decade, and the 2004 Allegrini Classico shows archetypal dried cherry and earth flavors. The last red had us all guessing Beaujolais, but it was a Spanish wine, a 2004 tempranillo from Bodegas Gormaz in Ribera del Duero, lightly fruity with mineral flavors.While 24 bottles is a small slice of the inexpensive wine market, the percentage of wines that we liked was high enough to warrant experimentation. The risk is not high, and if you find a wine you like, who knows, maybe you too will have a story to live on for years to come.E & M Berger Austria Kremstal Grüner Veltliner 20051 liter $10*** Crisp, clean and fresh with distinct floral, citrus and mineral flavors.

"'06-09-06,'0','As their stars progress side by side in this tournament, the Davis Cup teams from the United States and Russia are building anticipation for their semifinal in Moscow.The matchup will be held on red clay two weeks after the end of the United States Open.Yesterday, Patrick McEnroe, the United States team captain, announced the members of his team. Andy Roddick and James Blake will again headline the group in singles. They will be joined by Bob and Mike Bryan, twins ranked No. 1 in the world in doubles.The group has been together for three consecutive Davis Cup meetings in the past year, winning all three, against Belgium, Romania and Chile. But Russia presents the toughest challenge yet, and its players have had more success on clay.“The Russians are obviously extremely tough and doing well here as well,” McEnroe said yesterday, referring to the Open. “But I wouldn’t say that clay is their best surface, you know. I’d say it’s a surface that they certainly had better results on it than we’ve had, but I think they’ve picked a surface more against us rather than for themselves.”Among the Russian players, Nikolay Davydenko, seeded sixth at the Open, was ahead by two sets to one against Andy Murray in the fourth round before play was suspended because of rain yesterday. Marat Safin, the 2000 Open champion, whose ranking has dropped to 104th, had just started the first set of his fourth-round match against Tommy Haas. Mikhail Youzhny will play Rafael Nadal in the quarterfinals. Dmitry Tursunov, the other member of Russia’s team, lost in the third round.'"
"'06-09-06,'0','After 20 months and $21 million, the investigator hired by Merck’s board to determine whether the company hid the risks of the painkilling drug Vioxx has rendered his verdict: The company behaved more or less perfectly.“The report is essentially a very positive report, because that’s the conclusion I reached,” said the investigator, former federal judge John S. Martin, Jr., at a press conference Wednesday. The investigation by his law firm, Debevoise & Plimpton, was entirely independent, he said.Merck stopped selling Vioxx in September 2004 after a clinical trial showed the drug can cause heart attacks and strokes. More than 30,000 people have sued the company, alleging that Vioxx caused heart problems. In four of the eight suits to reach a verdict, jurors have found the company liable and in each of those cases have awarded punitive damages — financial penalties meant to censure egregious conduct.But Mr. Martin said Debevoise had found that Merck took “reasonable steps” to research Vioxx’s health risks. No one at the company could have known that Vioxx was dangerous to the heart before 2004, when Merck withdrew the drug after a clinical trial revealed its risks, he said.Board members at the news conference said they did not expect changes in the way Merck operates as a result of the investigation.'"
"'06-09-06,'0','Tensions between the Kyrgyz government and Islamic groups in the south of the country have grown, however, and there have been small skirmishes in southern Kyrgyzstan this year between government security forces and gunmen they call Islamic militants and members of banned extremist groups.American officials said they had no theory yet about the major’s disappearance, and avoided all speculation. They also appealed to the Kyrgyz people on national television and Web sites, asking for information about her whereabouts.“We are terribly concerned,” the American ambassador, Marie L. Yovanovitch, said in a telephone interview. “She has been missing for over 24 hours.”The air base and the embassy also released pictures of the major, showing a lean blonde woman in her early 30’s, about 5 feet 2 inches tall. In one picture she is wearing blue jeans and a light green shirt. Capt. Anna Carpenter, a spokeswoman for the air base, said they were the same clothes she was wearing when she disappeared.Ms. Yovanovitch said that staff members from the air base and the embassy were working with the S.N.B., which is the Kyrgyz successor to the Soviet K.G.B, and the police, who were examining all of the security video available at TSUM for more insights into how Major Metzger had spent her time in the store.The initial leads, derived from the store videos and cellphone records, were inconclusive.Mr. Jangarayev, the spokesman for the national police, said that Major Metzger used her cellphone at 2 p.m. to call a number at a former Soviet farm about nine miles outside of Bishkek. She spoke with someone for two minutes, he said.She called the same number at 3:39 p.m. and spoke for about 15 seconds. Mr. Jangarayev said it is not yet clear whom she spoke with on the calls.The next insight into her whereabouts came from videotapes at TSUM, which show her on the second floor of the store at 4:18 p.m, he said.Later, her phone was called twice but she did not answer, he said. Records from her cellular service provider show that by this time her phone was out of the store and had been carried through the city.The first call, at 5:35 p.m., reached her phone near the capital’s eastern bus station, he said. The second call, at about 7 p.m., reached her phone at Tunguch, a residential area on Bishkek’s eastern outskirts, Mr. Jangarayev said. Neither call was answered and the phone was shut off a short while later, he said.Mr. Jangarayev said it was not clear who was trying to call her. “We are trying to find this out now,” he said.Military personnel stationed at Manas are allowed to travel off the base only with permission and in groups. Major Metzger, who is assigned to the 376th Air Expeditionary Wing, was on an approved trip with members of the section where she works, Captain Carpenter said.Mr. Jangarayev said the group had separated in the store but agreed to meet at a certain time. When the rest of the group gathered, Major Metzger did not appear,Mr. Jangarayev said the rest of her group traveled back to the base, hoping the major had returned on her own, but found no sign of her. After she was discovered missing, the city’s hospitals were searched, but without result, Captain Carpenter said.Mr. Jangarayev said that Major Metzger had friends in the city and that she was scheduled to leave Bishkek this week, having finished her tour of duty.He said that the pattern of her phone calls suggested that perhaps she was someone’s guest in Bishkek, or that she had left with an acquaintance. Such a move would be highly unusual behavior for a career American military officer, however, and the embassy played down all theories and declined to comment on them.“I think at this point we just can’t speculate,” said Ms. Yovanovitch, the American ambassador, noting that the investigation was just beginning.'"

"'06-09-06,'0','Advisers to Mr. Cuomo said that he had no ties to Mr. Farkas until after he left government, and that Mr. Cuomo was not personally involved in the settlement. A Cuomo spokeswoman, Wendy Katz, called the article “long on innuendo disproved by facts.”Mr. King’s withdrawal and the Voice article combined to shake the dynamics of a race that was already a combative contest between two competitive and well-known New Yorkers, Mr. Cuomo and Mr. Green; the third remaining candidate is Sean Patrick Maloney, a former aide to President Bill Clinton.Mr. Green, who refused to take Mr. King’s courtesy telephone call yesterday informing him of the withdrawal, sought to steer the news media to the Voice article, while the Cuomo campaign organized a news conference with Mr. King and other black supporters to highlight Mr. Cuomo’s commitment to social justice.Addressing reporters under the portico of City Hall, Mr. King was joined by Mr. Cuomo, City Comptroller William C. Thompson and Representative Charles B. Rangel, the Harlem Democrat who, along with the Rev. Jesse Jackson, helped broker Mr. King’s endorsement of Mr. Cuomo. It was a clearly a painful decision for Mr. King, who has now been unsuccessful in three attempts at statewide office.“Well, this is a bittersweet moment for me,” Mr. King said. “But it’s the right moment to do what I’m going to do: endorse Andrew Cuomo.” Mr. King said that both Mr. Rangel and Mr. Jackson had approached him, arguing that Mr. Cuomo was most likely to win.Mr. King’s withdrawal represents yet another chapter in the on-again, off-again friendship between him and Mr. Cuomo, the former housing secretary in the Clinton administration. Before Mr. Cuomo aborted his race for governor four years ago, Mr. King was his ticket-mate for lieutenant governor. The two men, who were once good friends, have seen their relationship sour largely as a result of their competition for the post of attorney general. Of Mr. Cuomo, Mr. King said yesterday, “He is going to be our nominee. He’s incredibly qualified.”The Green campaign released a statement even before Mr. King’s news conference, saying that they considered the development insignificant, noting his weak poll numbers: “Charlie King at 2 percent dropped out.”They then highlighted the article in The Voice, saying it raised ethical questions about Mr. Cuomo’s relationship with Mr. Farkas, the chief executive of Island Capital, a real estate investment fund that employed Mr. Cuomo after he served as housing secretary.According to The Voice, Mr. Cuomo, while housing secretary, personally authorized the filing of a federal civil suit in 1997 that accused another Farkas company, Insignia Financial Services, “of paying $7.6 million in kickbacks to the owners of 17 federally subsidized projects that Insignia managed.”Aides to Mr. Cuomo said that the Insignia inquiry was part of a larger case against the government’s main target, and that Insignia offered helpful cooperation. The case against the company was eventually settled with payments to the government but no admission of wrongdoing.Mr. Cuomo’s aides also noted that only the Department of Justice could authorize the settlement, though the housing agency was a party to the settlement. The Voice article details the role of several Cuomo aides in pursuing the settlement.Years later Mr. Cuomo developed a professional relationship with Mr. Farkas. Island Capital paid Mr. Cuomo a total of $1.2 million in 2004 and 2005 and an undisclosed amount in 2006. Mr. Farkas and his associates have also made at least $800,000 in campaign contributions to Mr. Cuomo, according to The Voice.Mr. Barrett, the Voice reporter, said in an interview that Mr. Cuomo had been worried about the report.“Andrew said that the story was so serious that I should run it during the general election because it was so close in time to the primary,” Mr. Barrett said. “We had a two-hour interview and other discussions. He certainly was taking it very seriously.”Mr. Barrett described a telephone call last week from an anxious-sounding Mr. Cuomo; soon afterward, Mr. Farkas agreed to a longstanding interview request. A little while later, a lawyer for Mr. Farkas, Elkan Abramowitz, sent The Voice what Mr. Barrett called “a libel letter trying to suppress the story on behalf of Farkas.”“We tried to alert The Village Voice that there were issues that we felt needed to be further explored, and that the allegations that we heard they were prepared to make were false,” Mr. Abramowitz said. “The letter was one of caution.”Mr. Abramowitz declined to assess the article and would not comment when asked if any parts of it were wrong. He said he was not aware of any legal action on Mr. Farkas’s behalf that might be under consideration.At the City Hall news conference yesterday, Mr. Cuomo sidestepped reporters’ questions about his relationship with Mr. Farkas, saying first that he had not read the article and then saying that it described that relationship incorrectly.'"
"'06-09-06,'0','As an economic analysis, the study assumed that investors’ calculations of those risks, not irrational panic, was responsible for the substantial stock market declines. The researchers also assumed that the stock prices of those 48 companies would not recover.The study comes as the stock option scandal continues to widen. More than 100 companies, from Silicon Valley start-ups to prominent brands like Apple Computer are now either under investigation by the federal government or conducting their own internal reviews. Dozens of companies are working to restate earnings or are preparing for new tax bills, and in at least two cases, executives are facing criminal charges.On Wednesday, members of the Senate Banking Committee and the Senate Finance Committee will be briefed on the scandal’s latest developments by top government officials and corporate governance experts in dueling sessions this morning on Capitol Hill. No company executives are scheduled to testify.With just a few weeks until midterm elections, no new legislation is expected to emerge from the hearings. But the sessions could set the stage for Congress to revisit the hot-button issue of executive pay during the next term, policy makers and governance watchdogs say.“This isn’t as tangible to people as Enron’s thievery was — it’s much more esoteric,” said Gregory P. Taxin, the chief executive of Glass, Lewis & Company, a proxy advisory firm. But if options backdating “is found to have occurred at hundreds of public companies to the tune of billions in illicit gains, Congress is going to see this as a populist issue.”With close Congressional races ahead, the Senate panels have been set up in a way that allows lawmakers to score points with voters for closely monitoring executive pay. But they were not set up to investigate what, if anything, has gone wrong. No executives at companies involved in the backdating scandal were asked to testify. Nor was the Business Roundtable invited, despite being an influential chief executive lobbying arm.“What you will see is a very clear message to the regulators to get cracking and enforce the law,” said Damon A. Silvers, associate general counsel of the A.F.L.-C.I.O.Still, others added that the scandal may open the door for Congress to tackle broader issues related to executive pay, like golden parachutes. But Congress’s track record on the issue has been spotty at best, with lawmakers reluctant to interfere with private sector pay levels and unintended consequences overshadowing the benefits of past efforts at reform.On Wednesday, the Senate Banking committee will be briefed on the options scandal by Christopher C. Cox, the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and Erik Lie, the University of Iowa finance professor whose statistical research is widely credited with identifying the improper grant practices.The Senate Finance Committee, meanwhile, will discuss both the backdating scandal and a broad range of topics related to executive pay. Paul J. McNulty, the deputy United States attorney general; Linda Cutler Thomsen, the S.E.C.’s director of enforcement; and Mark W. Everson, the Internal Revenue commissioner, will testify about their agencies’ recent investigations.'"

"'06-09-06,'0','In a deal seen as an effort to catch up with those firms, Merrill Lynch announced yesterday that it would pay $1.3 billion to buy the First Franklin Financial mortgage unit of the National City Corporation, which was among the first to issue interest-only mortgages that allow borrowers to pay no principal in the early years of their loans. In August, Morgan Stanley acquired Saxon Capital Inc., a residential mortgage lender and servicer, and Deutsche Bank and Barclays have been buying home lenders to feed the demand for mortgage-backed securities.Banks, insurance companies, hedge funds and other large investors are buying the bonds for high returns and because their structures allow them to choose just how much risk they want to shoulder.“No one has gone cold on this market,” said Guy D. Cecala, president of Inside Mortgage Finance, based near Washington. “There has been speculation that banks would pull away from it or someone else would, and nobody has. Part of the problem is what else is out there?”Mr. Cecala was echoing the sentiments of many money managers. For all the concerns about the slowing housing market and indebted American consumers, they note that investors have few options for earning relatively high returns in an era of low interest rates.Mortgage-backed securities, the biggest sector of the bond market, have been critical in fostering the long housing boom. It has allowed banks and mortgage companies to sell loans to investors so they can turn around and make more mortgages.Long dominated by three government-created institutions — Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae — mortgage bonds are now roughly split among those agencies and other financial institutions, which include mortgage companies like Countrywide Home Loans, Washington Mutual and the big Wall Street firms. The agencies still dominate bonds backed by conventional 30-year, fixed-rate mortgages, but attention and money have been shifting in the last three years to “private label” issuers that deal in adjustable-rate and subprime loans.Mortgage bonds are attractive to investors because they pay more than Treasury securities and have proved only somewhat more risky — at least so far. For lenders and homeowners, the securities have become a rich spigot of capital that has lowered borrowing costs.But there is the potential for growing strain in the close relationship between homeowners and their financial patrons.If investors stop buying or sell their holdings, either because of troubles in the housing market or an unrelated financial calamity, the cost of home loans would shoot up. Homeowners, meanwhile, could cost portfolio managers millions or billions in losses if too many of them default on payments.Most of the attention has so far focused on the financial health of borrowers: Will they be able to adjust to higher monthly payments as interest rates and monthly payments on adjustable-rate loans climb? Will a feared drop in home values reduce their ability to refinance?In June, default rates on subprime mortgages, loans made to people with poor credit, increased to 6.88 percent of securitized loans from 5.49 percent a year earlier, according to a report released yesterday by Friedman, Billings, Ramsey & Company. Another report released yesterday showed that in the second quarter home prices rose at their slowest pace since the fourth quarter of 1999.Many experts agree that borrowers are under growing stress but note that homeowners typically do not renege on their debts unless they lose their jobs or face some other significant distress. A larger concern, they say, is the staying power of fast-moving investors who in recent decades have stampeded out of countries and sectors at the first sign of trouble.“If something really bad happens, you are not going to take any U.S. financial institutions out,” said Scott Simon, a managing director at Pimco Advisors, the large bond management firm. “What you will have is you will lose liquidity in the mortgage market.” And “that could happen at a time when the homeowner needs it the most,” he added.Mr. Cecala notes historical precedents for such rapid flights. After Russia defaulted on its debts in 1998, many foreign investors pulled back from the American mortgage market in a rush to lower their risks.So far, though, sophisticated financial structures and historically low default rates have kept the relationship between investors and homeowners from fraying.Mortgages packaged and sold to investors are divided into classes, each of them with different risk and financial characteristics. The lowest end of the bonds, which are also known as subordinated positions, are often taken up by hedge funds and foreign investors, who get higher returns but are the first to lose their investments if borrowers cannot make monthly payments. Investors at the highest end earn smaller returns but are the last to incur losses.In recent months, credit rating agencies have pressed issuers to increase the range of loans falling into the subordinated category because default rates on loans issued this year have been higher at this stage in their lives than for comparable mortgages issued in the last three years, said Grant Bailey, a director at Fitch Ratings.Standard & Poor’s tightened standards after noticing that borrowers with two liens on their homes, lower credit scores and little home equity were 50 percent more likely to default in the last three years than other borrowers, said Kyle Beauchamp, an associate director at S.& P.Officials at the Federal Reserve have also repeatedly expressed concern about nontraditional mortgages and have, along with five other regulatory bodies, proposed tightening lending standards late last year. Final rules are not expected until late this year.Still, there is a slim premium, or spread, between the returns earned by the higher-rated portions of mortgage bonds and the subordinated classes. For instance, bonds backed by subprime mortgages are offering yields of 5.48 percent for the AAA class, 6.33 percent for the BBB class and 7.23 percent for BBB– rated bonds, said Anthony V. Thompson, a managing director at Deutsche Bank in New York. By comparison, a 10-year Treasury note had a yield of 4.78 percent on Monday.Buyers are still investing in the bonds, Mr. Thompson said, because the vast majority of borrowers have not fallen behind or defaulted on home payments. And while credit raters may be getting tougher on new issues, they have not downgraded many existing bonds, he notes.Indeed, the bonds have become more attractive, said Mr. Cecala of Inside Mortgage Finance, because as interest rates have risen, homeowners have less incentive to refinance their home loans. Bondholders do not like borrowers who quickly repay mortgages because investors have to find new places to put their money to work, often for smaller returns.“If demand stays as strong as it is now and there will be less supply” because fewer borrowers refinance, Mr. Cecala said, “it will make them more valuable.”But he worries that investors may not be fully prepared for what could be coming. “We have never had a mortgage-backed market where a third or more of the product is subprime or has potential credit problems,” Mr. Cecala said. “If something does go wrong, you will see a lot of things being impacted.”'"
"'06-09-06,'0','A team of 30 researchers found that African countries had made many incremental changes.“The most surprising thing for me was to see the pickup of reform in Africa,” said Simeon Djankov, a World Bank economist who four years ago developed the rankings on the ease of doing business. “Something has happened this year. At least two-thirds of Africa’s countries have at least one positive reform.”Tanzania computerized its business and tax registries and reduced delays in customs inspections and the courts.Ghana has cut the corporate tax rate to 25 percent, from 32.5 percent, and made it easier to export goods.Rwanda scrapped a law adopted during Belgian colonial rule that had given one official a monopoly on notarizing documents for the entire country.Ivory Coast slashed the time to register property to a month from more than a year by eliminating a requirement that the urban minister give his consent.Wealthy donors like the World Bank, the United States and Britain, which focus on spurring economic growth and job creation, are putting heavier emphasis on such changes in deciding where to provide aid.The Millennium Challenge Account, President Bush’s aid program, explicitly uses the bank report’s measure of days to start a business as one criterion for deciding who qualifies for large grants.Economists outside the bank say the wealth of statistical information and rankings are useful to countries seeking to improve their investment climates.But they also caution that scoring well in the rankings is no guarantee of economic growth and no substitute for a broader economic strategy.“It’s just one piece of the puzzle,” said William Easterly, a former bank economist who is now an economist at New York University.Dani Rodrik, a Harvard economist, said the report focused on steps that got government out of the way — like cutting taxes and regulations — but he said that countries often needed governments that encouraged industries through subsidies, preferential tax policies or special economic zones.“What’s assumed is that if government provides the right environment for property rights, contract enforcement and low taxes these economies will take off, but in actual fact, economic development requires a government more actively involved with the private sector,” he said.Mr. Djankov, an author of the report, agreed that there were things a government could do that might be more important to economic development than the factors in the report. For example, he said, building a port might make be significant but it could also cost billions of dollars and take years to complete, unlike the changes in the report. “These reforms are very cheap and easy to do for a government,” he said.The bank’s “Doing Business” report ranked 175 countries by the number of days it takes to start a business and on other indicators that measure contract enforcement, investor protections, corporate taxation levels and the flexibility businesses have to hire and fire workers.The nations the bank named as the top 10 reformers were, from the best, Georgia, Romania, Mexico, China, Peru, France, Croatia, Guatemala, Ghana and Tanzania. Eastern Europe, Central Asia and wealthy Western nations were the leading regions, followed by Africa. This year, South Asia brought up the rear.'"
"'06-09-06,'0','Intel, which until recently employed 102,500 workers, finds itself in the predicament of having to shed workers and sharply cut capital spending during a relative boom time for chip demand.According to iSuppli, a market research firm in El Segundo, Calif., Intel’s share of the worldwide chip market shrank to 11.4 percent in the second quarter, from 13.2 percent in the first quarter. It was Intel’s smallest market share in four years.In particular, Intel has continued to lose share to A.M.D. in the market for the microprocessors used in consumer and corporate computing markets.In the second quarter of this year, A.M.D.’s share rose to 22 percent, from 16 percent a year earlier, according to Mercury Research, a technology market research company in Scottsdale, Ariz., while Intel declined to 73 percent, from 82 percent.A turnaround at Intel is likely to take at least another year, Mr. Acree said. “What we haven’t seen is traction from Intel’s new products,” he said. “That’s going to take time. But we expect Intel will gain back market share.”The company said Tuesday that its plan would save $2 billion in costs and operating expenses in 2007 and $3 billion the following year. It also said it would aim to avoid $1 billion in capital expenditures by more efficient use of its plants. The reduction of 10,500 jobs is to be achieved by mid-2007.In regular trading, before the layoffs were announced, shares of Intel rose 11 cents, to $19.99, but they fell after hours to $19.73.Intel’s profit in the second quarter fell 57 percent, to $885 million, or 15 cents a share. Last quarter’s sales also continued to disappoint Wall Street, falling 13 percent, to $8.01 billion.Profits at both Intel and A.M.D. also suffered from fierce price competition between the companies. An inventory glut at Intel grew in the second quarter in part because the price war caused customers to wait for even further price cuts.Intel’s stumble at a time when an ever larger portion of the world’s economy is driven by the microprocessor stems largely from a series of strategic missteps over the last decade, analysts say.One crucial error was made more than a decade ago. It was rooted in Intel’s attempt to divide the computing industry into two markets, one for x86 chips, where it faced fierce price competition, and one for a new processor design known as the Itanium that it created in conjunction with Hewlett-Packard. The company thought it could dominate the desktop and portable PC industry by outmanufacturing its processor chip rivals, while creating a high-end corporate computing market that it could rule with the Itanium.The strategy failed in part because of the rise of Internet-style computing, which has led to an explosion of cheap server computers that run e-mail and Web sites and are based largely on x86 chips, and because of Microsoft’s decision to make the x86 standard the focus of its new operating system, Vista.“This is the ultimate repercussion of Intel’s customers not buying the Itanium,” said Mark Stahlman, a technology strategist at Gartner Invest, a Wall Street-oriented computer industry research service.Further compounding Intel’s woes have been other disappointing initiatives in markets for communications and consumer-oriented computing. This year it sold its communications processor group to Marvell, and its Viiv consumer microprocessor strategy, introduced with fanfare at this year’s Consumer Electronics Show, has not yet shown great promise.'"
"'06-09-06,'0','WASHINGTON, Sept. 5 — President Bush said Tuesday that he would nominate Mary Peters, a strong advocate of bringing private companies into the construction and operation of highways, to be the next transportation secretary.Ms. Peters, a former head of the Arizona Transportation Department, served in Mr. Bush’s first term as head of the Federal Highway Administration, then worked as an executive at a transportation engineering firm, HDR. If confirmed, which is likely, she would succeed Norman Y. Mineta, who announced in June that he would be resigning after five and a half years on the job.Appearing with Mr. Bush at the White House, Ms. Peters said the nation’s transportation infrastructure was getting old.“We are experiencing increasing congestion on our nation’s highways, railways, airports and seaports,” she said. “And we’re robbing our nation of productivity and our citizens of quality time with their families.”Ms. Peters is a member of an advisory board created by the Reason Foundation, a conservative research and policy group. Robert Poole, the foundation’s director of transportation, said Ms. Peters had been “outspoken” in advocating public-private partnerships for new roads, and getting away from the traditional model of using gasoline taxes. Revenue from those taxes has not kept up with the inflation in building costs, Mr. Poole said.'"
"'06-09-06,'0','Price declines are spreading to more parts of the country. The 89 areas affected in the second quarter compares to 66 metropolitan areas where prices fell in the first three months of the year. In the fourth quarter last year, only 29 areas reported such declines.Prices were lower in five states — Michigan, Massachusetts, Maine, Ohio and Indiana — though the declines were less than 1 percent. Just one state, Iowa, had a price decline in the first quarter and none did in the fourth quarter last year.“The slower sales get, and given where inventory is, it is going to require sellers to cut prices in certain markets,” said Celia Chen, director of housing economics at Moody’s Economy.com.Ms. Chen noted that the index showed that prices were still rising in much of California, Arizona and Florida, states that experienced some of the biggest rises during the recent boom. But that may be in part a result of the fact that the government’s home price measure does not include homes with mortgages greater than $417,000.By comparison, data from the National Association of Realtors showed that the national median home price for existing homes, the price at which half sold for more and half for less, increased 0.9 percent in June from the same month a year ago. That measure, however, is not adjusted for changes in the quality and size of homes sold from one year to the next, which the government index does take account of.In recent years, the boom in home prices has helped increase spending by allowing consumers to take out home equity loans and larger mortgages with cash out.But home equity borrowing has slowed in recent months and mortgage applications are down about 20 percent from a year ago.'"
"'06-09-06,'0','When it opens to the public, visitors will be asked to make a $10 contribution, or $40 for a family, though they can walk in for free. The center will be open from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. on Monday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday and Saturday, and from noon to 6 p.m. on Sunday and Tuesday.Visitors will enter a gallery about the construction of the trade center and its vibrant everyday life, centered on an eight-foot-tall model.They will turn a corner into the second gallery to find what may be the most unnerving artifact: a mangled section of an airliner’s fuselage with one whole passenger window recognizably intact. This riveted, rounded portal almost invites a viewer to imagine what an awful panorama it must have framed for someone that morning.“We don’t want to know which plane this came from,” said Lee Ielpi, the vice president of the families’ association, explaining that in its anonymity, the wreckage stands for a more universal loss.In the third gallery, within sight of a monumentally deformed steel beam, is one of Mr. Ielpi’s donations to the exhibition: the battered helmet and turnout coat, torn down the right side, that were worn by his son Jonathan. The helmet carries badge number 12642, which was Mr. Ielpi’s when he was a New York City firefighter and was passed on to Jonathan, who was killed on 9/11, then to Jonathan’s brother, Brendan, who is now a firefighter.Responding to the center’s request for personal mementos, Evelyn Tepedino sent a pink and green fishing lure made by her daughter, Jody Nichilo, who worked in the north tower, and a note she wrote when she was about 10: “Dear Mom, Hi! How are you. I am fine. Well, I am writing this letter to tell you that I am going to wash the dishes tonight. O.K. Well, see you later. Love ya.”Ms. Tepedino, who lives in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, said it was difficult to choose a few remembrances. “There was so much to say,” she said. “How can I shorten it and make anyone aware of who she was?”Theresa Roberts sent a basketball jersey signed by the team at St. Catherine’s Church in Glen Rock, N.J., in memory of her husband and their coach, Timothy J. Finnerty. “I had pictures and other articles,” she said, “but more than anything else, that shirt was who Tim was.”“It means something that other people see in that shirt what I do,” she added. The jersey bears many signatures, including those of John Embry (“You pushed me to be a better player”), Daniel Kenny (“Your presence on the court made us all better players”) and Dane Osborn (“Your love for basketball inspired us all”).In an even more intimate tribute, the family of Alfred J. Braca donated items that were recovered from his pockets, depicting someone who was simply on his way to work: Cantor Fitzgerald ID cards, $76 in cash, Jeep keys on a remote-lock fob with a panic button, a deposit slip still in its original triplicate form and several credit cards with 2002 expiration dates.Ann Johnson wanted to convey a more pointed message by sending a copy of the death certificate issued for her son Scott. Regarding that ornate document, she hopes visitors will focus on Line 8, as she did in October 2001.“I looked at it and saw the word ‘Homicide,’ and that broke my heart all over again,” Mrs. Johnson recalled. “We talk about those who were lost. We use all these euphemisms. But, in fact, it was murder.”'"

"'06-09-06,'0','In 25 years of living with dogs, I’ve learned that they are social creatures with complicated and surprising personalities and, like people, must be treated as individuals.To simply cow them into submission and call that good behavior reflects more on the twisted ego of the trainer than on the character of the dog. Philip GerardMark Derr’s criticism of Cesar Millan misses an essential point: Most dog owners and, unfortunately, most so-called dog trainers, are not behaviorists or animal ethologists. And most dog owners cannot afford to hire someone who will take weeks or months to train an unruly pet.Mr. Millan’s formula of exercise, discipline and affection works on all but the most extreme cases because the dog is, first and foremost, an animal with needs that cannot be ignored.Chief among these is the need for exercise, which in most families is also a need of the human members that goes unmet.Exercise works wonders because it satisfies much of the natural need for play that can quickly turn to aggression if not fulfilled.Many dog owners believe that they can love their dogs into good, companionable behavior, and become frustrated or frightened when that love proves inadequate to the task.Mr. Derr’s point, that dominance is not the answer, simply ignores the more salient and central message of Cesar Millan’s method: that dogs, and people, need structure to feel secure. Julie ShemitzFinally, an accurate discussion of the “Dog Whisperer.’’His methods are dangerous, and his fame and apparent gift make it difficult to disagree with his methods.I face clients every day with aggressive dogs that would have never become aggressive if their owners weren’t trying to be the “pack leader.’’I consulted with a woman who loved her dog, but he was biting her — no one else, just her.After I explained that the methods she had been using were causing her dog’s problem and discussed what she needed to do, she looked at me and said, “Sorry if this is a dumb question, but can I cuddle with my dog?”The answer for this dog was absolutely yes. It is so sad that depriving one’s dog of attention has become a way to treat its behavior problems.Some dogs do have problems with dominance; most of them do not, and labeling a dog with the wrong diagnosis is just as harmful as recommending the wrong treatment program.

"'06-09-06,'0','Five restaurants from last fall’s preview that more or less hit their marks.A VOCE After years of satisfying diners with his levelheaded cooking at Café Boulud, the young chef Andrew Carmellini finally went out on his own and traded French for Italian cuisine. The results? Irresistible duck meatballs and amazing duck agnolotti that transcended the sometimes shocking decibel level of an oddly decorated room near Madison Square Park.BUDDAKAN It was always meant to be bigger and always meant to be brasher than its sister restaurant, Morimoto, just around the corner. The surprise was that this meatpacking district behemoth, with close to 300 seats, was in many ways, and on many nights, better as well. By its owner’s estimation, it’s the bigger hit. Sample its mao poe tofu or its Cantonese spring rolls and you won’t wonder why.COOKSHOP On a stretch of 10th Avenue that suddenly brimmed with culinary life, this restaurant sought an identity less flashy than Morimoto’s, less sweepingly elegant than Del Posto’s, more humble than Craftsteak’s. Its homey seasonal food, comfortable setting and sidewalk seating connected with diners, who have kept it relatively packed.FATTY CRAB The food cognoscenti chattered incessantly about it when it opened. They chatter about it still. This tiny, casual tribute to Malaysian street food has joined the pantheon of postage-stamp peculiarities (e.g., Momofuku Noodle Bar) with a special place in many food lovers’ hearts. And it’s kept the young chef Zak Pelaccio squarely on diners’ radar.TELEPAN Neither the best nor busiest of last year’s crop, it’s nonetheless an honest, admirable effort by a talented chef, Bill Telepan, to remain his own master and to create a midsize restaurant — remember those? — that’s neither an idiosyncratic nook nor a design extravaganza. And the Upper West Side needed it. FRANK BRUNI'"

"'06-09-07,'0','Still, while there have been investigations of directors over leaks of information in the past, the results of those investigations have typically stayed behind closed doors, experts noted.And other experts argued there could be times and places when there might be some justification for nonfinancial information to be leaked to the news media, including times when the board is struggling with a strong, imperialistic chief executive.“Leaking can be a mechanism for board members to change the dynamics and the atmospherics to get more leverage against the C.E.O.,” said Stephen Bainbridge, a U.C.L.A. law professor.But an individual leaking privileged information does not have a legal leg to stand on, Mr. Bainbridge quickly added. “A leaker, no matter how good his or her intentions may be,’’ he said, “is violating his or her duties in betraying corporate confidences.”In recent years, the H.P. board has been the scene of repeated controversy.The company’s $25 billion acquisition of Compaq spurred a heated proxy battle and last year the board unceremoniously pushed out Carleton S. Fiorina after it lost confidence in her.The latest boardroom eruption at Hewlett-Packard occurred in mid-May, when directors reviewed the results of an investigation spurred by its chairwoman, Patricia C. Dunn, into leaks to the news media. The report, which involved investigations into the private phone records of directors, named George Keyworth as the source of the leaks.When the board asked Mr. Keyworth to resign, he refused, arguing he had been elected by shareholders. A second board member, the well- known venture capitalist and a friend of Mr. Keyworth’s, Tom Perkins, immediately quit in protestWhile directors are bound to keep boardroom conversations under wraps as part of their fiduciary duties to the corporation and shareholders, some companies like Hewlett-Packard, go a step further and have directors sign confidentiality agreements, said John D. Capers, head of the corporate-governance practice with King & Spalding.“If a company asks directors to sign a confidentiality agreement, that is typically a step to make more formal an informal policy that already existed,” he said.Getting rid of a director, though, who has either breached his fiduciary duty or the confidentiality agreement is not easy, he added.“The board does not have the right to remove the director,” Mr. Capers said. “Only the stockholders can do that.”Hewlett-Packard could, however, file a lawsuit against Mr. Keyworth for breaching his fiduciary duty and lying about the leaking of information, said Joseph A. Grundfest, a professor of law and business at Stanford Law School.For now, Hewlett-Packard has recommended that Mr. Keyworth not be nominated for another term on the board.While few corporate-governance experts condoned leaking of boardroom conversations, many said Ms. Dunn may have gone too far in her pursuit of the matter.According to a document filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the board determined that an investigator hired by an outside consulting firm had employed a controversial technique known as “pretexting” that involves investigators using personal information to falsely represent themselves as another person to obtain information.“It’s almost unheard-of to treat the board of directors as adversaries and it seems like spying on your board members is a pretty adversarial move,” said Mr. Bainbridge, the UCLA law professor.The California state attorney general has requested information about how the leak investigation was conducted.Ms. Dunn and the board may also be on the hot seat with the S.E.C. over how it disclosed Mr. Perkins’ resignation from the board.The company said it believed at the time that Mr. Perkins did not have any disagreement with H.P. on any matter relating to its operations, policies or practices. Such a disagreement would have required the company to file a fuller explanation of reasons for Mr. Perkins’s departure to regulators.After his resignation, Mr. Perkins began voicing concerns over the legality of the inquiry into the directors.“From what I’ve seen, it looks like what H.P. filed on the reason for Perkins leaving the board doesn’t match with what he says happened,” said Ralph D. Ward, publisher of Boardroom Insider, an online corporate governance newsletter. “It looks like they were trying to put a whitewash on the situation.”Hewlett-Packard, in an S.E.C. filing, said it believed that its disclosures regarding Mr. Perkins were “accurate and complete at the time of filing and were based upon Mr. Perkins’ actions and representations prior to such time concerning the reasons for his resignation.”'"
"'06-09-07,'0','“I’m just out here playing, still trying to figure things out, still enjoying it, still being successful,” Davenport said. “Follow this road and see where it goes.”While that road will take her to a lower-level tournament in Bali tomorrow, the Open will continue for the top three seeded players.The world’s No. 1 player, Amélie Mauresmo of France, advanced to the semifinals with a 62-minute, 6-2, 6-3 victory over the 20-year-old Dinara Safina of Russia. Mauresmo will play third-seeded Maria Sharapova, who needed 2 hours 11 minutes last night to overcome a feisty challenge from the 27th-seeded Tatiana Golovin of France, 7-6 (4), 7-6 (0).Sharapova shrieked to Golovin’s distraction, closing when it counted. She will try to do that tomorrow in her third major semifinal of the season, though that could be difficult since Mauresmo has beaten her three times. “I don’t have anything to lose going into this match,” Sharapova said.Henin-Hardenne, seeded second, will play the 19th-seeded Jelena Jankovic, who is even more carefree, in the other semifinal tomorrow.Against Davenport, Henin-Hardenne served with precision, uncorked her powerful one-handed backhand and overcame rib pain that forced her to call a trainer for a five-minute treatment after she won the first set.Davenport broke her in the third game of the second set, but Henin-Hardenne broke back in the ninth game, coming up with crafty drop shots.“She remains a great champion, a big name, somebody you have to count on,” Henin-Hardenne said of Davenport. “I’m happy with what I did today. It was Davenport in fine form. She goes after you. Not easy to break her.”Davenport was more encouraged than disappointed by yesterday’s result. She was away from tennis for five months, recovering from two bulging disks in her back and a concussion from a fall at her home.After playing in only one tournament this summer — a point of contention between Davenport and the WTA Tour — she won four matches here, saving two match points two rounds ago.“I look at things rationally,” she said. “I’d be amazed if someone had told me this a few weeks ago, a few months ago. I feel like I played really well, but I played a girl who plays better against me.”Davenport, who overcame an arm injury she sustained in New Haven, leaves New York trying not to reflect on how well she did eight years ago, before she was married. “I feel like I was a different person there,” she said. “I’ve seen the highlights twice and it doesn’t seem real.”She has won 51 titles in her career and amassed $21.7 million, earnings that are second to only Steffi Graf. And yet, Davenport retains an unassuming demeanor.Before the Open, Davenport specifically asked U.S.T.A. officials that she not be feted, let alone interviewed on court after her last match because she was uncertain of her future. But in the wake of the Agassi tributes, the way Davenport left the Open seemed subdued.Davenport said in an interview last month that she had nearly sued the WTA Tour because it would not grant her wild cards to enter two tournaments this summer. She wanted the Tour to exercise a rule that she contended allows her, as a veteran, the flexibility to make a late commitment so she would not have to pull out because of injury.But the WTA Tour’s chief executive, Larry Scott, interpreted the rule as not applying to her. Not wanting a confrontation, Davenport did not file a lawsuit, preferring to concentrate on results. But yesterday, she was having second thoughts because the issue came up again.Davenport had wanted to enter a top-level October tournament in Zurich. She said she was told that she missed the deadline by three days and that Scott would not apply the exemption.She started the year at No. 1, but Mauresmo has held that spot for the past 21 weeks. After beating Henin-Hardenne to win the Australian Open and Wimbledon titles this year, Mauresmo is starting to feel comfortable with her success.“I’m just enjoying it,” Mauresmo said. “I don’t think too much about what could happen or what’s going to happen or what have I done.”She said that before the Open began she had considered withdrawing, concerned about aggravating a tear in her adductor muscle playing the week before in New Haven.But with extra rest because of the rain, Mauresmo seems to be enjoying the din of New York, appreciating the electric atmosphere. “When you do well somewhere, you start to kind of like it,” Mauresmo said.'"
"'06-09-07,'0','Jawn A. Sandifer, a former New York State judge who as a young lawyer argued a civil rights case before the United States Supreme Court that served as a precedent for the landmark Brown v. Board of Education decision, died Friday in Sarasota, Fla. He was 92.The death was confirmed by his niece, Sherri Sandifer.In 1950, Mr. Sandifer was one of two staff lawyers for the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People who successfully argued Henderson v. United States. In its 8-0 decision, with one justice recusing himself, the Supreme Court ruled that railroads that operate across state lines may not bar passengers from eating in dining cars because of their race. “The denial of dining service to any such passenger subjects him to a prohibited disadvantage,” the decision said. “The right to be free from unreasonable discriminations belongs to each particular person.”In an interview in 1995, Mr. Sandifer described the prejudice that his client, Elmer W. Henderson, had faced. “Even if a black person bought in New York a first-class ticket on a train that included dining privileges,” he said, “once that train left Washington and went south, he or she could not eat in the dining car. You could walk in, every seat could be empty and there was no room for you. At best, they’d put you behind a curtain.”The Henderson case is considered one of several Supreme Court rulings in the late 1940’s and early 50’s that served as precedents for Brown v. Board of Education, the 1954 Supreme Court ruling barring segregation in public schools.Throughout his career, both as a lawyer and on the bench, Mr. Sandifer opposed discrimination. In 1986, as a State Supreme Court justice in Manhattan, Mr. Sandifer ruled that a Civil Service test for sanitation workers discriminated against women, allowing them for the first time to be hired by the city to handle garbage.'"
"'06-09-07,'0','Any move that makes the International Monetary Fund — and for that matter other major global institutions — look less like an old boys’ club is a good move. So the I.M.F.’s executive board began doing the right thing last week when it decided to give China, South Korea, Turkey and Mexico slightly larger voting shares — and promised them even more say to come.A reapportionment is essential for bolstering the fund’s credibility. And it is long overdue. China represents about 15 percent of the world’s gross domestic product but has only a 2.9 percent voting share at the fund, which will grow to 3.7 percent. (Belgium, with less than 1 percent of the global economy, has a 2.1 percent share.)All of this may sound pretty arcane until one considers the fragile state of the world economy. There is a clear need for a credible global institution to provide not only cash and bitter medicine to the poor and crisis-ridden, but also direction and frank criticism to richer countries whose problems could wreak global havoc if not addressed.The Bush administration, which championed the changes, is hoping that if China gains more of a stake in the global system it will have an incentive to behave more responsibly: allowing the yuan to strengthen against the dollar and reining in its export binge. China needs a more flexible currency, both for the sake of smooth trade relations — the system is pretty tetchy these days — and to gain more control over its economy. As long as China keeps the yuan artificially low, other Asian countries, eager to sell their own cheap exports, will too.But the advice can’t stop there. The fund needs to take a closer look at who’s buying all those cheap goods and borrowing all that excess cash from China. China may be the enabler. But the United States needs to reduce its enormous trade deficit and its enormous budget deficit, to protect its economy and for the sake of global stability.Some clear and urgent words on that from the fund should also be welcomed — although we fear the White House will prove less interested.'"
"'06-09-07,'0','“We see this as a watershed event in the options market,” he said.Other reasons contributing to the decision include growth in the options market and the fact that Nasdaq acquired the technology it needed to build an options exchange when it bought Instinet, Mr. Concannon said. The exchange will open in the third quarter of 2007.Nasdaq will be entering a crowded market, dominated by the Chicago Board Options Exchange and the International Securities Exchange. The two collectively control about 60 percent of the market.Nasdaq is far from the first exchange to diversify its product offerings. Its archrival, the New York Stock Exchange, bought Archipelago in 2003, an all-electronic exchange, which also gave the Big Board the ability to offer options trading. In August, NYSE/Arca controlled 9.6 percent of all options products, according to the Options Clearing Corporation, a data provider. The NYSE Group has also made a bid for Euronext, a pan-European exchange. Deutsche Bourse has also made a bid for Euronext.At the same time that stock markets are leaping into the options game, options markets are getting into the stock game. This year, the International Securities Exchange announced that it was starting a stock market; more recently, the Chicago Board Options Exchange followed suit.“This is a crowded field,” said Meyer S. Frucher, chairman of the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, which operates both stock and options markets. “How one breaks out is hard to see, although the one advantage Nasdaq might have is its desktop real estate with the INET terminal,” he said, referring to the fact that many traders already have the technology that will be used to trade options.The move reflects a new direction for Robert Griefeld, the chief executive at Nasdaq, who has told analysts and investors he has a “maniacal” focus on stealing market share from the New York Stock Exchange. That is a contrast to John A. Thain, chief executive of the NYSE Group, who has repeatedly emphasized his desire to build or acquire products in new regions around the world.Mr. Concannon said Nasdaq had not shifted its focus away from New York. “This is us having resources that we can leverage to step into what is a complementary product to our underlying asset class — equity,” he said. “This is not losing any focus on the NYSE story.”In March, Nasdaq made an unsolicited bid for the London Stock Exchange, which would not diversify Nasdaq’s products, but would diversify its geographical reach. When the offer was rebuffed, Nasdaq went on to amass a 25 percent stake in the exchange.As a result of that position, Nasdaq will have to wait until early October before acting again.'"
"'06-09-07,'0','Her disappearance perplexed local investigators and American officials alike, who said they had not categorized the case beyond calling it a missing-person investigation. There were no immediate signs of foul play, the authorities said, and as of Wednesday no one had claimed to have abducted her.Mr. Jangarayev said that Major Metzger had friends in the city and that she was scheduled to leave Bishkek this week.Kyrgyzstan, a small Central Asian republic, has allowed the United States to operate an air base at Bishkek’s civilian airport since late 2001. There has been little anti-American sentiment in the population, and the country, once a remote part of the Soviet Union, is largely peaceful and open to outsiders.Tensions between the government and Islamist groups in the southern part of the country have grown, however. There have been small skirmishes in the south this year between government security forces and gunmen whom the government characterizes as Islamic militants and members of banned extremist groups.American officials appealed to the Kyrgyz people on national television and Web sites, asking for information about Major Metzger’s whereabouts. “We are terribly concerned,” the American ambassador, Marie L. Yovanovitch, said in a telephone interview. “She has been missing for over 24 hours.”The air base and the American Embassy released pictures of the major, showing a lean blonde woman in her early 30’s and about 5 feet 2. In one picture she is wearing blue jeans and a light green shirt. Captain Carpenter said she had been wearing the same clothes when she disappeared.Ambassador Yovanovitch said the air base and embassy staffs were working with the S.N.B., the Kyrgyz security agency that succeeded the Soviet K.G.B., and with the police, who were examining all of the security videos available at TSUM.Initial leads, derived from the store videos and cellphone records, were inconclusive.Mr. Jangarayev, the spokesman for the national police, said the major used her cellphone at 2 p.m. Tuesday to call a number at a former Soviet farm nine miles outside Bishkek. She spoke with someone for two minutes, he said. She called the same number at 3:39 p.m. and spoke for about 15 seconds, Mr. Jangarayev said, adding that it was not clear to whom she had spoken.He said the next insight into her whereabouts came from the TSUM videotapes, which showed her on the second floor of the store. Later her cellphone was called twice but she did not answer, Mr. Jangarayev said. Records from her service provider showed that by then her phone had left the store and traveled through the city, he said.The first call, at 5:35 p.m., reached her phone near the capital’s eastern bus station, he said, and the second call reached the phone about 7 p.m. at Tunguch, a residential area on Bishkek’s eastern outskirts. Neither call was answered and the phone was shut off a short while later, Mr. Jangarayev said.He said it was not clear who was trying to call the major. “We are trying to find this out now,” he said.After she failed to meet the rest of the group in the store they returned to the base, Mr. Jangarayev said, hoping that she had returned on her own, but they found no sign of her.Captain Carpenter said the city’s hospitals had been searched to no avail.Mr. Jangarayev said the pattern of her calls suggested that she might have been someone’s guest in Bishkek or had left with an acquaintance. But such a move would be highly unusual for a career American military officer, and the embassy declined to comment on such theories.“I think at this point we just can’t speculate,” Ambassador Yovanovitch said.'"
"'06-09-07,'0','Nor did investigators involved in preparing the report interview Dr. Steven E. Nissen, Dr. Eric J. Topol or other prominent scientists who have criticized Merck, Mr. Martin said.Merck stopped selling Vioxx in September 2004 after a clinical trial showed the drug could cause heart attacks and strokes. More than 30,000 people have sued the company, contending that Vioxx caused heart problems.In four of the eight suits to reach a verdict, jurors have found the company liable, and in each of those cases have awarded punitive damages — financial penalties meant to censure egregious conduct.But Mr. Martin said Debevoise had found that Merck took “reasonable steps” to research Vioxx’s health risks. He said that no one at the company could have known that Vioxx was dangerous to the heart before 2004, when Merck withdrew the drug after a clinical trial revealed its risks. Evidence produced in lawsuits against Merck has shown that company scientists repeatedly discussed Vioxx’s potential dangers as early as 1997.Board members at the news conference said Merck would probably make few, if any, changes in the way it operated as a result of the investigation.Mark S. Cheffo, a partner at Skadden, Arps, a law firm that often represents drug makers, said he understood why people might view an internal investigation skeptically. But Mr. Cheffo, who had not seen the report, said it was important to examine the evidence it presented before judging its credibility. Mr. Cheffo does not work for Merck and is not involved in the Vioxx litigation.The main body of the report runs 180 pages, with 20 appendixes that include another 1,500 pages. Lawyers for Debevoise reviewed millions of pages of documents and interviewed more than 150 witnesses, including some outside scientists who consulted for the company. The investigation took 53,000 hours, according to Debevoise.The report, however, has no narrative explaining how Raymond V. Gilmartin, Merck’s former chief executive, communicated with Dr. Edward M. Scolnick, its former chief scientist, or other senior scientists and executives at Vioxx during the years it was under development and then on the market.Instead, it essentially consists of point-by-point rebuttals of the criticisms that scientists and plaintiffs’ lawyers have made against Merck since the company withdrew the drug, including contentions that Merck misled federal regulators and marketed the drug without properly disclosing its heart risks.The specifics of the rebuttals are almost exactly the same as those offered by Merck’s defense team in the civil suits against the company.In May, Debevoise gave a draft copy of the report to Theodore V. H. Mayer, a lawyer at Hughes Hubbard & Reed who is coordinating Merck’s defense in the suits. Mr. Mayer and Kenneth C. Frazier, Merck’s general counsel, reviewed the report for accuracy, Mr. Martin said at the news conference. But they did not compromise the independence of his investigation, he said.Dr. William G. Bowen, chairman of the special six-member board committee that retained Debevoise, praised Mr. Martin’s investigation.“The special committee and the board are reassured by the comprehensiveness, care and clarity of this analysis,” he said. “The main question the board wanted answered was, ‘Did senior management at Merck knowingly put people at risk?’ ”Now that question has been answered, Dr. Bowen said.'"
"'06-09-07,'0','Apple Computer announced yesterday that it was updating its most popular desktop computer, the iMac, with faster versions of Intel chips and the lowest-price model yet.Four iMac models are now available with Intel’s Core 2 Duo processor, Apple, which is based in Cupertino, Calif., said in a statement. The iMacs are as much as 50 percent faster than Intel models released earlier this year.Apple began the switch to Intel chips in January and now offers the faster processors in all desktop and notebook computers. The new Intel chips use less power and run more quietly than older processors.In addition to offering iMacs with 17-inch and 20-inch flat-panel displays, Apple added versions with a 24-inch screen. Prices range from $999 to $1,999.Apple also said it added Core Duo chips from Intel to its Mac mini. The computer is Apple’s least expensive desktop machine, starting at $599, and sells without a monitor, keyboard or mouse. Apple had been offering versions with Intel Core Duo and Core Solo processors.'"
"'06-09-07,'0','The British-born Mr. Baron Cohen, who calls himself an observant Jew, has performed this same high-wire comedy act for his HBO series, “Da Ali G Show,” in which he plays three characters, including Borat, each hilariously offensive in its own right.The title character of the show, Ali G, is a vaguely Muslim British idiot with a hip-hop persona, who was the subject of a rather tame, and unsuccessful, film in 2002, “Ali G Indahouse,” released straight to video in the United States.With “Borat,” Mr. Baron Cohen — who shares screenplay credit with several others — decided to head straight for the most sensitive areas of politically incorrect global culture, and for the first time will be doing so for a mass audience, far beyond the sophisticated niche of HBO. The film is to be released by 20th Century Fox on Nov. 3 on more than 2,000 screens nationwide.Mr. Baron Cohen, who is appearing in Toronto as Borat, declined to be interviewed for this article and will be conducting interviews ahead of the film only in character.20th Century Fox also declined to comment for this article or otherwise participate. Executives at the studio said that they were concerned about overemphasizing the political aspects of the humor, or otherwise labeling the movie, which they said they hoped would have broad appeal to a young audience.The film is experimental and highly unusual for Hollywood, in some ways reminiscent of the guerrilla humor of Andy Kaufman, who baited members of the unsuspecting public with his characters, or the buffoonery of Charlie Chaplin as a Hitler-esque tyrant in “The Great Dictator” in 1940.Film historians said that Hollywood was usually reluctant to take on controversy in general and had particularly avoided treating anti-Semitism in the past.“Hollywood has a history of avoiding controversial topics, and notably did so at the end of the 1930’s, with the rise of Nazism and anti-Semitism,” said Jonathan Kuntz, who teaches American film history at the University of California, Los Angeles. Studios “were afraid of offending audiences, and of limiting their popularity in the European market,” he added. “And because so many moguls were Jewish, they were afraid this would be used to attack Hollywood as anti-Nazi.”Today too Hollywood is often reluctant openly to discuss anti-Semitism, as was evidenced by the careful debate over Mel Gibson’s 2004 blockbuster, “The Passion of the Christ.” Only when Mr. Gibson was heard making anti-Jewish slurs this summer during a drunken-driving arrest did a few Hollywood veterans speak out against him.“Borat” was to some extent made outside the Hollywood system. Fox kept the film off its production list and created a separate company, One America, to be the nominal producer. Mr. Baron Cohen also ran into creative differences with his first director, Todd Phillips, who left the production last year, while the film shut down for five months. The veteran comedy director Larry Charles eventually completed the film.A spokesman for Mr. Baron Cohen said that Mr. Phillips’s departure was “a mutual decision.”During the shoot Fox ignored numerous protests from the Kazakh Embassy in Washington, whose officials were concerned about the depiction of their country as prejudiced.Early indications are that the film will be a hit. It rocked audiences with laughter at the Cannes Film Festival, where Mr. Baron Cohen was photographed on the beach wearing a neon-green kind of thong, and won an audience award at Michael Moore’s Traverse City Film Festival in Michigan this summer.Still, “I can almost guarantee you that not everyone will get the joke,” said Richard B. Jewell, a professor of film history at the University of Southern California. But he added: “In my opinion it’s a very healthy thing. Some of best films that have been made in the last 50 years have been black comedies.” He cited “Dr. Strangelove,” which poked fun at nuclear holocaust.“What can be more serious?” he asked. “It makes people think about these things in ways they don’t when there are more straightforward, serious, sober films.”'"
"'06-09-07,'0','The English playwright William Congreve wrote that music can soothe the savage breast. But what about a teething baby? The iCrib Sound System from Munchkin is a set of speakers that lets you put an iPod or any other pocket-size music player into your baby’s crib.The iCrib, available from retailers listed at www.munchkin.com for about $30, runs on four AA batteries. You use Velcro straps to hang it on a rail, and then slip your iPod into a plastic holder that hangs outside the crib, theoretically out of reach of exploring hands.A night-light option gently cycles through mellow colors, perhaps hypnotizing the little one into silence if the music doesn’t work. A sleep timer makes it easy to choose 15, 30 or 60 minutes of music.Keep in mind that when the speakers turn off, your player doesn’t, potentially draining its batteries. There is no volume control — you use your player for that.If a steady stream of digital lullabies from the iCrib doesn’t put your baby to sleep, perhaps a choice political podcast will do the trick.

"'06-09-07,'0','CBS’s huge promotional campaign in advance of Katie Couric’s arrival as anchor of its evening news program paid a rich dividend, at least on her opening night: the broadcast drew 13.6 million viewers on Tuesday, its largest audience in more than eight years, according to preliminary estimates by Nielsen Media Research released yesterday by the network and its competitors.By comparison “NBC Nightly News With Brian Williams,’’ the ratings leader since Mr. Williams succeeded Tom Brokaw in December 2004, drew an estimated 7.8 million viewers, nearly six million fewer than Ms. Couric. In an indication that, at least for one night, Ms. Couric had siphoned some viewers from NBC — where she worked for more than a decade as co-host of “Today’’ — Mr. Williams’s overall audience was off about 10 percent from its average for the previous week.“World News With Charles Gibson,’’ the ABC broadcast, which typically finishes second to Mr. Williams’s, drew an estimated 7.6 million viewers Tuesday, finishing behind both CBS and NBC. Mr. Gibson’s audience was roughly equal to that of a week earlier.Ms. Couric’s audience on Tuesday was nearly double the 7.2 million who, on average, watched the “CBS Evening News’’ last week, Bob Schieffer’s last as interim anchor. CBS said Ms. Couric’s audience was the largest for its evening news program since Feb. 16, 1998, when it was led by Dan Rather during the network’s coverage of the Winter Olympics in Nagano, Japan.Among those viewers of most interest to evening news advertisers — those aged 25 to 54 — Ms. Couric also dominated, with a 3.9 rating, compared with about 2.3 each for NBC and ABC; in that category, both NBC and ABC were little changed from the previous week. (A ratings point in that demographic represents about 1.22 million viewers. )Meanwhile, in another closely watched arrival on Tuesday, Rosie O’Donnell’s first morning as a co-host of “The View’’ on ABC was seen by an estimated 4.2 million viewers, roughly 54 percent more than the 2.7 million who watched on Sept. 6, 2005, the day after Labor Day last year, according to preliminary Nielsen figures provided by an ABC official only on condition of anonymity.'"
"'06-09-07,'0','BOWING to pressure from environmental groups and European lawmakers, several cosmetics makers are removing a chemical from nail polish that is suspected of interfering with the endocrine system.Orly International and OPI Products have already started selling reformulated nail polishes without the chemical, dibutyl phthalate. Sally Hansen plans to start selling similarly reformulated products in 2007.Some studies have linked exposure to dibutyl phthalate — a plasticizing ingredient that has been used to increase flexibility in nail polishes as well as medical equipment — with testicular problems in rats and humans. The chemical is banned from use in cosmetics in Europe and is considered a reproductive toxin by California.A study that examined nail polishes and perfumes, published in 2004 in The Journal of Toxicology and Environmental Health, concluded that the amount of exposure to dibutyl phthalate from these cosmetics is relatively small. The study cautioned, however, that total exposure to the chemical from multiple sources may be greater and requires further investigation.Companies are adjusting formulas even though beauty executives said the ingredient is safe in the concentrations in which it is used in cosmetics.“We are reacting here to changing consumer trends and a changing regulatory environment,” said Bruce MacKay, the vice president for scientific affairs/R&D of Del Laboratories, the maker of Sally Hansen. “In high concentrations in lab experiments, these materials may be of concern, but there is no body of evidence that says this particular ingredient is not safe in the concentration in which it is used in nail products.”But health groups like the Breast Cancer Fund, an advocacy group in San Francisco that focuses on the environment, said that phthalates are too risky to use in consumer products.'"

It’s plastic. It has a blue drawstring closure. And it comes free with every purchase at the Ralph Lauren boutique at the Billie Jean King National Tennis Center in Flushing, N.Y.“We love that plastic shopping bag with the big blue horse and rider on it,” said Marilyn Bates, a tourist from Waban, Mass., who attended last week’s match between Andre Agassi and Marcos Baghdatis. The logo bag, which made its debut at last year’s tournament, is a big hit this year. “I bought one of those white tracksuits, but I asked for two bags — one for the pants, one for the jacket — so that I could give the bags to my daughters-in-law.”Polo Ralph Lauren, an official sponsor of the United States Open and the outfitter for on-court officials, is using the tennis tournament to introduce digital shopping whereby visitors can order clothing via colorful touch-screen computer consoles. But it is this low-tech giveaway sack that is delighting analog tennis fans.“It’s perfect because you can hang it off your back and leave your hands free to take photos or get an autograph from Rafael Nadal, not that I’ve been able to find him yet,” said Laurie Matthews, a landscape architect from Boston, who was wearing the bag on Tuesday slung across one shoulder.'"
"'06-09-07,'0','Not all doctors buy into the technology.“A dermatologist can absolutely see sun damage with a naked eye,” Dr. Wechsler said. “UV photos aren’t necessary.” She said they are often used as a scare tactic, “something to show the patient so they can see what’s happening under the surface.”It can seem gimmicky, she said.To treat brown mole-like spots or patches, dermatologists might prescribe bleaching products containing hydroquinone, which doesn’t actually bleach the skin but inhibits the production of melanin, and reveals lighter skin in four to six weeks.Products containing 2 percent hydroquinone are available over the counter. But the Food and Drug Administration is concerned about the safety of the bleaching ingredient and last week proposed banning nonprescription sales after research suggested a link to cancer in laboratory rats. The ingredient also has been linked to reported cases of exogenous ochronosis, a permanent darkening of the skin.The actual risk of cancer or skin darkening is unknown, and it’s unclear if using less concentrated formulations reduce the likelihood of problems, so dermatologists don’t recommend over-the-counter, unsupervised use. Under the proposed ban, hydroquinone will be available only by prescription.But some doctors said limited and supervised use can be effective in treating pigmentation from sun damage and recommend a prescription of Tri-Luma, which combines 4 percent hydroquinone, Retin-A and a steroid into one cream. A two-month supply costs $100 to $150.“Hydroquinone is very effective when used correctly but it can be tricky,” said Dr. Debra Jaliman, assistant clinical professor of dermatology at Mount Sinai School of Medicine and a spokeswoman for the American Academy of Dermatology, who said she has been prescribing lightening creams for 20 years without complications.“It can be irritating for some people,” she said. “You don’t want to use it for a long period of time, and you must wear a broad-spectrum sunscreen to get results. In my care, I watch patients closely and tell them when to stop.”Some dermatologists will also recommend more aggressive treatments, which are also potentially more risky. In-office peels may reduce pigmentation as well as treat rough areas and thickened skin, both of which can be caused by sun damage. But the cost of the most common peels, glycolic or salicylic acid, are about $100 to $200 a treatment, and they can cause mild peeling or redness for a couple of days.Other peels are more intense — like Jessner’s or TCA peels, which cost $200 to $500 — and cause more severe peeling and require up to a week of recovery.Many dermatologists will also recommend laser and intense pulse light treatments to address pigmentation, broken capillaries and stubborn redness, and even to treat precancerous skin cells. Though they are considered safer than aggressive chemical peels, they can still damage the skin and, in rare cases, cause scarring.Those treatments are also more expensive: $200 to $2,000 each, depending on the laser and size of the area to be treated, and some require up to five sessions to achieve full results.Dr. Thomas Kupper, chairman of dermatology at the Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston, as well as at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, said he is skeptical of some lasers. “The concern is not that lasers are harmful, but that they won’t live up to their hype and expectation,” he said.Before embarking on a course of treatment for sun damage, it’s important to discuss the risks and potential side effects with a dermatologist. As for preventing damage in the seasons ahead, it is O.K. to worship the sun, dermatologists say, but it is best done lathered in a broad-spectrum sunscreen from beneath the cool shade of an umbrella or wide-brimmed hat.'"

Nicoletti, was hired by the producers of the mini-series in July 2005 to oversee its technical accuracy, but left after less than a month because of scenes he believed were misleading or just false.“There were some of the scenes that were total fiction,” said Mr. Nicoletti, who served as a supervisory special agent and a member of the joint terrorism task force before retiring in 2003. “I told them unless they were changing this, I could not have my name associated with it.”Chief among Mr. Nicoletti’s concerns were scenes that placed people at places they had not been present at and scenes that depicted events that were out of chronological order.“There were so many inaccuracies,” he said.Mr. Nicoletti said he asked the producers to make changes, but was rebuffed. “I’m well aware of what’s dramatic license and what’s historical inaccuracy,” Mr. Nicoletti said. “And this had a lot of historical inaccuracy.”'"
"'06-09-08,'1','The C.I.A. report also directly contradicted claims made in February 2003 by Secretary of State Colin L. Powell, who mentioned Mr. Zarqawi by name no fewer than 20 times during a speech to the United Nations Security Council that made the administration’s case to go to war. In that speech, Mr. Powell said that Iraq “today harbors a deadly terrorist network’’ headed by Mr. Zarqawi, and dismissed as “not credible’’ assertions by the Iraqi government that it had no knowledge of Mr. Zarqawi’s whereabouts.In fact, the Senate investigation concluded that Mr. Hussein regarded Al Qaeda as a threat rather as a potential ally, and that the Iraqi intelligence service “actively attempted to locate and capture al-Zarqawi without success.’’The report by the committee specifically criticized a decision by the National Security Council in 2002 to maintain a close relationship with the Iraqi National Congress, headed by the exile leader Ahmed Chalabi, even after the C.I.A. and the Defense Intelligence Agency had warned that “the I.N.C was penetrated by hostile intelligence services,” notably Iran.The report concluded that the I.N.C. had provided a large volume of flawed intelligence to the United States about Iraq, and concluded that the group “attempted to influence United States policy on Iraq by providing false information through defectors directed at convincing the United States that Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction and links to terrorists.”The findings and their release came at an inopportune time for the Bush Administration, which has spent the week trying to turn voters’ attention away from the missteps on Iraq and toward the more comfortable political territory of the continued terrorist threat to the United States.On Friday, White House spokesman Tony Snow downplayed the significance of the reports, saying that they contained “nothing new” and was “re-litigating things that happened three years ago.”“The important thing to do is to figure out what you’re doing tomorrow, and the day after, and the month after, and the year after to make sure that this war on terror is won,” Mr. Snow said.The reports released are expected to be the least controversial aspects of what remains of the Senate committee’s investigation, whose incomplete tasks include addressing the question of whether the Bush administration’s assertions about Iraq accurately reflected the available intelligence.But their completion had been delayed by months, and their release in the midst of a White House campaign that emphasized terrorism appeared to have occurred by coincidence.The reports were actually approved by the committee in August, but went through a month-long declassification process. It was Senator Pat Roberts of Kansas, the committee’s Republican chairman, who set early September as the release date for the reports.The committee’s initial report in 2004, which lambasted intelligence agencies for vastly overestimating the state of Iraq’s nuclear, biological and chemical weapons program, was issued with unanimous support. The reports released on Friday provided evidence of how much the relationship between Republicans and Democrats on the committee has degenerated over the past two years. A set of conclusions that included criticism of the administration’s ties with the Iraqi National Congress was opposed by several Republicans on the panel, including Mr. Roberts, but was approved with the support of two Republicans, Senators Chuck Hagel of Nebraska and Olympia Snowe of Maine, along with all seven Democrats.Senator Roberts even took the unusual step of disavowing the conclusions about the role played by the I.N.C., saying that they were “misleading and are not supported by the facts.”The report about the I.N.C. ‘s role concluded that faulty intelligence from the group made its way into several pre-war intelligence reports, including the October 2002 National Intelligence Estimate that directly preceded the Senate vote on the Iraq war. It says that sources introduced to American intelligence by the group directly influenced two key judgments of that document: that Mr. Hussein possessed mobile biological weapons laboratories and was trying to re-constitute his nuclear program.The report said there was insufficient evidence to determine whether one of the most notorious of the intelligence sources used by the United States in the run-up to the Iraq war was tied to the Iraqi National Congress. The source, an Iraqi national code-named Curveball, was a key source for the American view that Mr. Hussien had a mobile biological weapons program, but the information that he provided was later entirely discredited.But the report said other mistaken information about Iraq’s biological program had been provided by a source linked to the Iraqi National Congress, and it said the intelligence agencies’ use of the information had “constituted a serious error.’’The dissenting opinion, signed by Mr. Roberts and four other Republican members of the committee, minimizes the role played by the Mr. Chalabi’s group. “Information from the I.N.C. and I.N.C.-affiliated defectors was not widely used in Intelligence Community products and played little role in the Intelligence Community’s judgments about Iraq’s W.M.D. programs,” the Republicans said.Francis Brooke, an I.N.C. spokesman, called the report “tendentious, partisan, and misleading,” and agreed with the Republican dissent that the I.N.C. did not play a central role as the Bush Administration built the case for war.At the same time, Mr. Brooke said his organization was surprised at how little the American government actually knew about Saddam Hussein’s regime before the Iraq war, which may have forced the American officials to rely more heavily on the I.N.C.“We did not realize the paucity of human intelligence that the administration had on Iraq,” Mr. Brooke said.'"
"'06-09-08,'1','Almost 87 yards, that is. Miller appeared to be dragged down out of bounds at about the 1. But the referee signaled the touchdown.And in what figures to be the first officiating controversy of the season, the officials did not see Dolphins Coach Nick Saban leisurely throw out the red flag to signal that he wanted to challenge the call.“They said they didn’t see it,” Saban said. “Whose fault is that?”Batch and the Steelers’ offensive coordinator, Ken Whisenhunt, thought the pass play would go to receiver Hines Ward, but he was double-teamed. “When their safety drove on him, there was nobody on me,” Miller said.Miller said he looked up at the stadium’s giant television to see if the Dolphins were gaining on him during his run to the end zone. They were.“It seems like it took so long,” he said. “I was happy to make it in.”Joey Porter intercepted a Daunte Culpepper pass and returned it for a touchdown a few minutes later to seal the victory.The Steelers did not look much like the team that won the Super Bowl, not with Roethlisberger out and the retired Jerome Bettis sitting in a broadcast booth in a suit and a tie.But the real backbone of Pittsburgh’s championship run — its blitzing, confusing defense — was intact against the Dolphins, and that was enough to befuddle Culpepper for most of the first half. He was sacked. He threw short. He threw long. And in the first quarter, Miami could barely move the ball.When the schedule came out, it was hard to imagine that Culpepper, recovering from a devastating knee injury, would be starting and Roethlisberger would be out. But Roethlisberger’s activity for the night was limited to embracing Batch after each of his two first-quarter touchdown passes.Batch won two games last season when Roethlisberger had a knee injury. Batch may get only one more start before Roethlisberger is ready to return, but he made the most of his opportunity, completing 15 of 25 passes for 209 yards and 3 touchdowns. Willie Parker, who will absorb the carries that Bettis used to get, wore down the defense.Late in the first quarter, Parker, who gained more than 1,200 yards in Bettis’s shadow last year, began to emerge. He carried seven times on one drive as the Steelers moved into Dolphins territory. Then Batch threw a pass to the deep right corner, where Nate Washington leapt and hauled it in for a 27-yard touchdown that gave the Steelers a 7-0 lead.Miami needed a 47-yard punt return by Wes Welker to finally get a scoring chance. Two plays later, Ronnie Brown, the Dolphins’ featured running back, went 2 yards up the middle for a touchdown to tie the score with 9:46 left in the first half. Brown also scored from 5 yards out in the third quarter.Then, after nearly a half of torpor, the offenses sprang open. Parker burst out for a 32-yard run, breaking free from linebacker Zach Thomas. Pittsburgh then received a break when cornerback Andre Goodman, starting for Travis Daniels, was called for interference as he linked arms with receiver Cedric Wilson, who was headed for the end zone. That put the Steelers at the Miami 7. Batch then threw a touchdown pass to Hines Ward, who slipped behind the defense and tiptoed along the back line of the end zone.That gave the Steelers a 14-7 lead, but the Dolphins gave a sneak peak of the dynamic offense Culpepper is expected to produce, driving 62 yards in 1:17. When it stalled near the end zone, Olindo Mare’s 26-yard field goal made the score 14-10 going into halftime and gave Miami a bit of momentum.The Dolphins, who won six consecutive games to end the 2005 season, are a popular pick to win the Super Bowl because Culpepper could finally give the offense the scoring power it has lacked since Dan Marino was the quarterback.Last night, however, he came up short, completing 18 of 37 passes for 262 yards and no touchdowns. He threw two interceptions.'"

"'06-09-08,'1','Most believe that when the police, four months into the hunt, arrested his daughter, her boyfriend and Mr. Phillips’s former girlfriend, and the authorities temporarily took custody of his daughter’s three young children, Mr. Phillips went from a man bent on escape, and who they say had already shot one trooper, to a man filled with rage.He is believed to be hiding in or near Chautauqua County, a sweeping arc of woodlands threaded with narrow dirt lanes and pocked by abandoned cabins and cars with the keys tucked above the visor or dangling from the ignition.He has survived, the police believe, with the help of a network of former girlfriends, friends from the nine state prisons where he has served time, and by using stolen cars and motorcycles. While his early exploits seemed to make him something of a folk hero, the killing of the trooper ended that. The vast majority of people in Chautauqua County want him caught.A letter he wrote to his lawyer shortly before his escape on April 2 seemed to foreshadow his new existence. “I am just not cut out for the life you folks live,” Mr. Phillips wrote. “I tried it. It didn’t work. Oh well.”His old friends listen to police scanners day and night, updating each other on cellphones, and seem to know almost as much about the progress of the manhunt as the police do. Seven people have been arrested and charged with harboring him.The latest, Todd A. Nelson, let Mr. Phillips stay in his home, in Ludlow, Pa., for as long as 11 days, sharing beer and pizza, the authorities said.The reward for Mr. Phillips’s arrest was raised to $425,000 on Thursday. And he was added to the F.B.I.’s most wanted list.In interviews, Mr. Phillips’s daughter, her maternal grandmother, his former brother-in-law and his estranged wife paint a complex picture of the fugitive. In their telling, Mr. Phillips grew from an abused and neglected boy to a thief who stole just for the rush of it, preferably leading the police into a chase.For more than half his life — since 1983 — he has lived almost entirely behind bars. Short periods of freedom ended in crime and capture. He seemed, they said, more comfortable locked up.Some women were drawn to him. He was gentle, handsome, mysterious. Indeed, Mr. Phillips, since his escape, has returned to several of the women from his past, according to the police and his wife, Terry Phillips, 43, who admits that she spent a day with him during his flight, early in the summer. They ran mundane errands, calmly strolling through a grocery store to buy detergent.That was June 9, Ms. Phillips said. The next day, the first trooper was shot.“What the hell is he doing?” she asked during a telephone interview on Wednesday, given on the condition that her current residence, in another state, not be revealed, for fear of putting herself in danger. “Why is he doing that?”Mr. Phillips was born on June 19, 1962, to Ralph and April Phillips. His father was some 40 years older than his mother, and was prone to drink and to violent outbursts, several members of Mr. Phillips’s extended family said.“He’d make him sleep in a barn,” said Emery Masiker, 43, a contractor and Christmas tree farmer who was once married to Mr. Phillips’s sister, and who was close to his mother until her death. “He was just an old, tired man.”His father may have steered him down the wrong path early on. “He was the one who taught him how to jump cars,” said Norma Gloss, 65, whose daughter had a child with Mr. Phillips.Mr. Phillips and his future wife, Terry, played together as early as age 7, she said, recalling playing house in bales of hay and provoking a bull so it would chase him. She said Mr. Phillips was sent to a home for delinquent boys, though she did not know for how long, and they had not seen each other for six years, when he pulled up with a smile and a stolen car. He was 13. “He came up to the driveway and said, ‘Come on, let’s go for a drive,’ ” she said.Then he was in custody again, she said. His juvenile record was not available, but those who know him said Mr. Phillips was a compulsive thief.“He went from bicycles to tractors to cars,” said Art Clever, 62, who owns a general store near the Phillips family’s now-crumbling home. He said Mr. Phillips was once chased into the store by four police officers, their guns drawn, and was arrested in the back office.Mr. Masiker said what he stole did not seem to matter. “Cigarettes, guns, money,” he said. “ He’d steal a set of pop machine keys and come back with piles and piles of coins. He’d be all right for a couple of days, but then, like an alcoholic, he’d go back again.”He fathered a daughter in December 1982 with his girlfriend Kasey Gloss, but he has spent most of the 23 years since then in prison, according to records.He spent three years shuttling between three prisons for stealing property from a garage in 1983. Nine months after his release, he was locked up again, for entering a home and threatening the residents with a rifle. He was released three years later, and was back in prison nine months after that.“I call them sabbaticals,” Ms. Horton said of the stints of freedom.His longest stint behind bars, for burglary and selling drugs, began on Nov. 5, 1992, and lasted 13 years. Soon after he began serving that sentence, one of his girlfriends was caught trying to sneak him a handcuff key hidden in her mouth, according to parole records and his friends.A Native American by blood, he enmeshed himself in Indian prison groups, his daughter said. He corresponded with Terry, his childhood friend and future wife, and she became a frequent visitor at Auburn Correctional Facility. They were married in a prison ceremony in 1995, she said.“In the visiting room, you’ve got time to talk, when it’s just you two,” she said. “We talked about our pasts as children, when we were 13. That’s all he wanted.” But a series of disciplinary violations, including one for “tampering with electricity,” resulted in his transfer to prisons farther away.“He built a CB radio in prison,” Ms. Phillips said. “He would invent. He did something with wires and a battery and he made a little night light.”They split up in 2003, at his urging, and he told her to live her own life, she said. They never divorced.He was released last November, a 43-year-old man, and moved to a halfway house in Buffalo. He seemed eager to reconnect with his daughter, whom he knew almost exclusively from her few prison visits.“I don’t drink or drug anymore,” he wrote in one of the many letters that the daughter, Patrina Wright, now 23, keeps in a shoebox, and from which she read excerpts. “My new image, you might say. No more prison for me, love. All done.”He continued: “I’m doing everything I am supposed to do, so don’t worry, O.K.? Things are different now, and I want to just be free.”He was free, for 49 days. Then he was accused of violating his parole, after a counselor at the halfway house reported that Mr. Phillips had threatened his daughter and her family.Mr. Phillips’s lawyer, John Keaney, said there was no threat. In his brief period of freedom, the lawyer said, Mr. Phillips had been given a pass to leave Buffalo.While away, he shared a Christmas dinner with, among others, a former friend who had let Mr. Phillips take the blame for some of his own crimes in 1992, Mr. Keaney said.The counselor wondered if spending more time in Chautauqua County, with his daughter, as Mr. Phillips wanted to do, was a good idea, because of the people like the former friend with whom he came into contact.Mr. Phillips replied that there was no problem, with unfortunate bluntness. Referring to the former friend, “He said: ‘If I wanted to — I was carving a turkey two feet away from him. I could have stabbed him. I could get a gun and shoot him, and I wouldn’t be sitting here asking you for a pass,’ ” Mr. Keaney said.Mr. Phillips’s daughter said her father would never have threatened her. “He just wanted his family,” she said. “He wanted to be a grandpa.”He wrote her from his cell: “I want you to know the depth of my love for you, and I’ll prove myself to you by proving I can put the past behind me.” He escaped several weeks later.A question arises: how can a man who has been locked up for so long be so knowledgeable about the outdoors? Mr. Masiker said he did not believe that his old friend was the survivalist he has been painted to be.“He goes to work like everybody else,” he said, referring to recent thefts. “He’s not woods guy, he’s not skinning raccoons. He’s not this Indian hunting guy. He’s an opportunist.”The grocer, Mr. Clever, predicted a violent end. “He’s a dead man walking,” he said. “Everyone around here has guns. If anybody sees him, they’re going to shoot him.”His wife was surprised, two months after the escape, to receive a call from him. “He said, ‘Hey, can I come over?’ ” she said. “I said, ‘Yeah,’ and I gave him my address. I’m like, ‘You’re going to go to the Laundromat with me?’ He goes, ‘Yeah.’ ”They shopped, and washed the clothes, and he returned to her home for a few short hours. His departure bore little resemblance to that teenager’s hopeful arrival in the driveway 30 years earlier, played in reverse this time and drained of light. “We said goodbye,” she said, “and he walked away in the dark, toward the car.”'"

"'06-09-08,'1','BRUSSELS, Sept 7 — Microsoft raised the stakes in its European antitrust battle Thursday by warning that the introduction of the Windows Vista operating system might be delayed there because of unclear antitrust guidance from the European Commission.The European competition commissioner, Neelie Kroes, wrote to Microsoft’s chief executive, Steven A. Ballmer, in March outlining her concerns that some new features in Vista would breach the same antitrust laws that Windows XP, a current version of Microsoft’s operating system, was found to have violated two years ago.Microsoft, based in Redmond, Wash., proposed changes to Vista that would address those concerns and said it had not been told whether the changes would be adequate.“Once we receive the commission’s response,” the company said in a statement, “we will know whether the commission is seeking additional product design changes that would result in delay in Europe.”But in a strongly worded response, the commission, the year-round administrative arm of the European Union, denied responsibility for any possible delay in the introduction of Vista, and accused Microsoft of twisting the truth. “It is misleading to imply that the commission could be the cause of delays,” said Jonathan Todd, spokesman for the commission’s antitrust division.'"
"'06-09-08,'1','Amazon will sell current and back titles of all major movie studios except Disney and has programs from several dozen television networks as well. Indeed, Amazon is the first video service to license the original “Star Trek” series.For many new movies, Amazon’s $14.99 maximum price is lower than other download services, like Movielink, which sells most new releases for $19.99. The studios have largely set the wholesale price of downloads above $14.99 hoping to keep the retail price at $20 or above. They do not want to alienate Wal-Mart, by far the largest movie distributor, which uses discount DVD’s to attract shoppers.Amazon is pricing some current movies higher than its $14.99 cap. For example, “Silent Hill” from Sony is $16.87 and “Rumor Has It” from Warner Brothers is $19.62.Bill Carr, Amazon’s vice president for digital media, declined to discuss the company’s pricing strategy or arrangements with studios.The chief executive of CinemaNow, Curt Marvis, said the high price of movies was one reason movie download services had not been popular.“We have learned that online customers expect prices to be low. Period,” he said. “It doesn’t matter if they are buying a car or a diamond earring or a movie.”Another problem, Mr. Marvis added, is that it is difficult to watch downloaded movies on home televisions. Most downloads, so far, are meant to be played back on a personal computer. While some computers can be wired to television sets, few are.CinemaNow has started selling some older movies in a form that allows them to be burned to DVD’s on computers and then played through regular DVD players. Mr. Marvis said for those titles, five times as many people burn DVD’s as watch movies on their computers.Mr. Carr declined to say why Amazon was not allowing users to create DVD’s.Amazon says its movie service improves on others because the video quality is higher. That quality comes at a price: longer download times. For example, “Inside Man,’’ which is 129 minutes long, is downloaded as a 2.2-gigabyte file on Amazon instead of a 1.5-gigabyte file on Movielink. Amazon says the typical movie will take two to seven hours to download, depending on the connection speed of the user.“We know our customers well and the one thing they tell us is they want high quality,” Mr. Carr said.To help consumers cope with the long download times, Amazon has introduced software that allows users to buy a movie while at work and have it automatically downloaded to their home computers.Amazon will also give customers that buy movies a second, smaller file that is meant to be loaded onto portable video players that use Microsoft software.'"
"'06-09-08,'1','PARIS, Sept. 7 — Lap Shun Hui, a California-based computer executive, will complete the purchase of Packard Bell, the European personal computer maker, from NEC of Japan later this month.Packard Bell’s chief executive, Aymar de Lencquesaing, said on Thursday that details of the deal would not be disclosed. Mr. de Lencquesaing said that Packard Bell had annual revenue of about $1.9 billion in its latest financial year and is “slightly profitable.”This will be the fifth incarnation for the legendary Packard Bell name, which came to life in the 1930’s as a radio manufacturer in the United States. In the 1970’s, it operated as a part of the military manufacturer Teledyne, and in 1986 a group of investors brought the name to low-cost PC manufacturing.Since 1995, it has been producing computers for consumers as NEC Packard Bell, but NEC announced that it would sell the division earlier this year to focus on computers for businesses. Mr. Hui made an offer in June, and executives said Thursday that the deal was expected to close at the end of September.Packard Bell, with headquarters in the Netherlands, has 10 percent to 12 percent of the European consumer computer market, making it the third-largest PC maker in that category.'"
"'06-09-08,'1','Executives working with the developer expressed disappointment that officials had focused on a few remaining issues instead of recognizing all that had been accomplished.And they countered that the Port Authority’s bureaucracy was moving too slowly, raising the project’s cost by hundreds of millions of dollars at a time when construction costs are rising 2 percent a month.“Tremendous progress has been made in discussions between the Port Authority and Silverstein,” said Janno Lieber, who oversees the trade center project for Mr. Silverstein. “We fully expect the deal to be finalized as scheduled in the very near future.”A tentative agreement in April between Mr. Silverstein and government officials was supposed to have put an end to years of acrimony.Under that plan, Mr. Silverstein surrendered to the Port Authority control of the $2 billion Freedom Tower and a second site nearby.He retained the rights to build the other three towers on the east side of the 16-acre trade center property, along Greenwich Avenue. The Port Authority, in turn, had to complete the excavation and site preparation for the towers along Greenwich Street in 2007 so that Mr. Silverstein could begin construction and complete the work by 2012. The agreement cut Mr. Silverstein’s development fee in half, to 2.5 percent.To ensure that he could get a mortgage and build quickly, the city and the authority offered to lease a combined 1.2 million square feet of space in what is known as Tower 4, the smallest of the three new towers, which has been designed by the architect Fumihiko Maki.According to state and Port Authority officials, negotiations over a final agreement were progressing quickly enough that Gov. George E. Pataki pushed for the Port Authority to meet yesterday, which was two weeks earlier than planned.Officials complained that Mr. Silverstein then tried to use the governor’s eagerness for a deal to extract concessions worth tens of millions of dollars, something Silverstein executives denied vehemently yesterday.In recent days, officials said, Mr. Silverstein said that he wanted the city and the authority to pay $78 a square foot for their office space, far more than the $50 a square foot officials assumed in April and $20 more than they offered in recent talks, according to state and Port Authority officials. The difference is no small matter: about $24 million a year.The officials said that Mr. Silverstein’s rent number for a building in 2012 was exuberant, even for the perpetually optimistic developer. The average rent today for first-class office space downtown is $41.78 a square foot, according to Cushman & Wakefield.The Silverstein camp offered to put the matter into the hands of a arbitrator, a suggestion that the Port Authority rejected.In a speech on Wednesday about the resurgence of Lower Manhattan, Deputy Mayor Daniel L. Doctoroff said jokingly, “Larry Silverstein is so confident in the future that he’s already raising the rent for the space the city will take in Tower 4.”He returned to the subject at yesterday’s news conference about the building designs: “What we are unveiling today is a true testament, Larry, to you and to your vision, to your perseverance, which we all wish sometimes you didn’t have as much of.”Another contentious issue involves the Port Authority’s obligation to excavate the sites along Greenwich Street by mid-2007, which would allow Mr. Silverstein to begin construction and adhere to the strict schedule laid out in April. Mr. Silverstein now contends that the Port Authority will not complete the work until sometime in 2008.Because of the delay, Mr. Silverstein said he should be entitled to a rent reduction over seven months, which officials said could be worth as much as $50 million.Port Authority officials countered that they have now figured out an engineering plan that would allow them to do the work by mid-2007.'"
"'06-09-08,'1','George Hudson, a spokesman for Sportingbet, declined to comment about the arrest, saying the company was awaiting further information. Sportingbet halted trading in its stock soon after learning of the arrest.After the arrest of Mr. Carruthers, legal experts and industry analysts and executives said they presumed that the American law enforcement effort was aimed at one company, BetOnSports.“We thought this was company-specific; now we know it’s broader than that,” said Sue Schneider, the publisher of Interactive Gaming News, an online magazine focusing on the Internet casino industry.Ms. Schneider, echoing the sentiments of other industry analysts, had said the one obvious lesson after the arrest of Mr. Carruthers was that executives of online casinos should not visit the United States and risk arrest. She and other analysts and legal experts said it was puzzling that Mr. Dicks had visited anyway.“It’s absolutely amazing,” said I. Nelson Rose, a professor and Internet gambling law expert at Whittier Law School in Costa Mesa, Calif. “Apparently he convinced himself this all involved Carruthers and BetOnSports.”News of the arrest sent shares of other Internet casinos tumbling in London, with shares in one major company, PartyGaming, falling 9.8 percent. Lawrence Walters, a Florida lawyer who focuses on gambling law, said there was good reason for investor concern, given that the arrest of Mr. Dicks indicates online casinos now need to be concerned about problems at the state level.Gambling law experts say federal law makes it fairly clear that operating Internet sports books is a crime. But they say the law is much less clear on the issue of other Internet games, like poker and blackjack.By contrast, Mr. Walters said, at least a handful of states explicitly criminalize poker and table games offered over the Internet. Offshore Internet casinos that had believed they could avoid scrutiny from the states might now have to rethink their positions.“There’s been a widespread assumption that the sites only needed to worry about federal law,” said Mr. Walters, who has represented some of the offshore casinos. “Now there’s a new level of concern that the previous comfort zone may be breached.”At the same time, Mr. Walters said he did not believe that states had the jurisdiction to regulate Internet gambling, which involves transactions that cross state and national borders.The policies of the federal government and some states are, broadly speaking, at odds with the rules governing online betting parlors in many countries, like Costa Rica and Antigua, where casinos have their operations. They also put law enforcement in conflict with millions of Americans who place bets online, using their home computers to wager on sporting events and games like blackjack and poker.Sportingbet, one of the largest online gambling operators in the world, had revenue of £103 million, or $193 million, for the year ended in July, with two-thirds of that coming from the United States, said Mr. Hudson, the company spokesman.Mr. Hudson said Mr. Dicks was a father of four who built a career investing in technology companies in the United States and Britain. Mr. Dicks joined Sportingbet as nonexecutive chairman in January 2000. “He’s not a swashbuckler like some of those other online betting types,” Mr. Hudson said.Law enforcement officials in New York said they expected Mr. Dicks to be extradited to Louisiana.Mr. Carruthers, who was dismissed as chief executive of BetOnSports, is under indictment by the attorney general for the Eastern District of Missouri.Some industry analysts said they believed Internet casinos would weather the latest attacks.“Online gaming will not end unless they prosecute every one of the 50 million Americans who bet online every year,” said Andrew P. Lee, a London-based online gaming analyst at Dresdner Kleinwort. “But from an investor’s perspective, this becomes a very difficult sector to invest in.”'"
"'06-09-08,'1','Rick Edmond calls it the brotherhood of the flashlight. They are men and women, some military, some civilian, working at the Pentagon, who feel that it is only a matter of time before they will be hit again and who, like Mr. Edmond, paid $4.99 for a tiny share of personal preparedness.“The next time it goes dark here, I want to be ready,” Mr. Edmond said, holding the five-inch metal flashlight he keeps with him at all times. “This place might as well have a bull’s-eye painted on the side.”On any other day, Mr. Edmond would have been at his desk that Tuesday morning five years ago, when the tip of the 757 jetliner crashed into his office. But he had gone to a meeting. To this day, he carries the burden of guilt and the sense of duty instilled by that near miss. The plane that struck the Pentagon on Sept. 11, American Airlines Flight 77, did so within an hour of the attacks on the World Trade Center, killing 189 people.“My friends say that I shouldn’t go back, considering how close it came,” he said. “For me, that’s exactly why I keep going back.”His biggest act of bravery, he said, was to return to work the next day. Coping, however, has come in smaller actions, he said. One such act is the so-called brotherhood of the flashlight, which started with buying what dangles from his colleagues’ key chains and tugs on their belts.“One thing you notice about the hallways here is that they’re really bright and really clean,” said Mr. Edmond, who has worked at the Pentagon, in Arlington, Va., since 1993, coordinating communication satellites, and who retired from the Army in 1995.'"
"'06-09-08,'1','Jenny Craig “has a policy of nondiscrimination on the basis of religion,’’ Ms. Hubble said in a statement, “and it complies with all federal and state laws regarding employee requests for religious dress accommodations.’’Cozette Phifer, the spokeswoman for Jenny Craig, confirmed that some staff members wore head scarves.Before Sept. 11, Muslim women who wore head scarves in the United States were often viewed as vaguely exotic. The terrorist attacks abruptly changed that, transforming the head scarf, for many people, into a symbol of something dangerous, and marking the women who wear them as among the most obvious targets for those who deem the faith threatening.Muslim leaders call discrimination a problem for many of the faithful, particularly for women like Ms. Atassi who wear head scarves and who say they face widespread discrimination in their careers and in their daily lives.Born to a Syrian father from a prominent political clan and an American mother who converted from Christianity, Ms. Atassi said she was the only Muslim at Flagler-Palm Coast High School in Bunnell, Fla., a wealthy area in the northeastern part of the state. During a three-year stay in Syria as a teenager, she began taking private religion classes and, she said, noticed that veiled women showed a self-confidence lacking among American women, who seemed to her to be trying to transform themselves into a Barbie-doll ideal.“I would meet women who were not attractive by Western standards,’’ Ms. Atassi said, “and when I told them, ‘You look beautiful,’ they would say, ‘I know, thank God.’ They really believe it. The veil facilitates inner strength, a greater feeling of self-esteem.”Ms. Atassi began wearing a head scarf, or hejab in Arabic, at age 16, along with a floor-length trench coat.About a year later, in July 2002, she said, she was passing through the airport in Amsterdam on her first trip outside the Arab world after the Sept. 11 attacks, when the security screeners singled her out, questioned her and made her remove her coat. Feeling violated, she said, she tore off her scarf in a bathroom and wept.“I had gained such a strong relationship with God that I didn’t want to do anything to distance myself from him, and I felt like I was doing just that,” she said.The head scarf stayed off for eight months. But she said she felt like a hypocrite as, bareheaded, she waged a campaign against anti-Muslim stereotypes at the University of Central Florida, where she is chairwoman of the Florida chapter of the Muslim Students Association. After she began wearing a head scarf again, she said, death threats and other offensive telephone calls salted with expletives started the very next weekend.Discriminating against people because of their religion is illegal in the United States. But it is difficult to prove, and many victims avoid even speaking about it publicly out of fear it may affect job prospects or bring other unwanted attention. Ms. Atassi said that her stepmother had removed her own head scarf after Sept. 11 and kept it off, afraid of her co-workers’ reaction. Ms. Atassi said she did not want to live that way.“I made the decision when I put it back on that I will never take it off again,” she said.'"

Duessel, an equities strategist who helps manage $218 billion at Federated Investors in Pittsburgh. Investors are “worried about an economy that is slowing more than expected.”The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index fell 6.24 points, or 0.5 percent, to 1,294.02. The Dow Jones industrial average declined 74.76, or 0.7 percent, to 11,331.44. The Nasdaq composite index dropped 12.55, or 0.6 percent, to 2,155.29.The S.& P. 500 has declined 0.8 percent this month on signs of weakness in housing and worries that inflation is accelerating. A report on Wednesday showing rising labor costs added to investor concern.'"
"'06-09-08,'1','Housed in the Brookings Institution, the initiative embraces a number of mainstream economic prescriptions — like the necessity of equitable international trade agreements, the virtues of a balanced budget, and making economic growth more broad-based — that capture Mr. Rubin’s eat-your-spinach approach to policy making.But by addressing issues like the costs to the economy of excessive litigation and regulation, Mr. Rubin intends to make the project a laboratory for the type of pragmatic, ideology-free policies that appeal to the project’s Wall Street advisers while also hoping to lure Democratic presidential candidates away from populist economic positions. And with Mr. Rubin and his successor and friend Lawrence H. Summers on board, it will also be a training ground for the next crop of financiers with ambitions to shape policy in a Democratic administration.They include those who have done so, like Roger C. Altman, the chairman of Evercore and a former deputy Treasury secretary; those who aspire to do so, like Steven Rattner of Quadrangle, the private equity firm; and, perhaps most important, younger Wall Street executives just now flirting with the idea.It is with this last group of executives, drawn largely from the booming world of hedge funds and private equity, that Mr. Rubin has loomed large as an Obi-Wan Kenobi figure.In the 1980’s he cultivated their early careers as arbitrage traders at Goldman Sachs, and he is now guiding them in the ways of securing influence in Washington.Eric Mindich, who runs Eton Park, a $5 billion hedge fund, led Goldman’s arbitrage desk at the age of 25, and in 1994, at 27, became Goldman’s youngest partner ever. Of the bunch, he comes the closest to being Luke Skywalker: a Harvard graduate like Mr. Rubin, he is a trustee and major donor, with Mr. Rubin, at the Mount Sinai Medical Center. He is also a contributor to Mr. Rubin’s favorite senator, Kent Conrad, the Democrat from North Dakota.Then there is Richard C. Perry, who left Goldman’s arbitrage desk in 1988 to form Perry Partners, now an $11 billion hedge fund. And Thomas F. Steyer, the founder of Farallon Capital, a $16 billion hedge fund, who also worked under Mr. Rubin in the 1980’s and was an adviser to Senator John Kerry’s presidential campaign in 2004.All three men are generous Democratic donors. But in the public policy realm they are relative neophytes — just as Mr. Rubin was in the early 1990’s before he signed on with President Clinton.“This is not a political undertaking,” Mr. Rubin said in an interview. “There have been some major policy disappointments and they need to be debated. You can conduct this debate without engaging the question of political attribution.”Asked if the project would take aim at Bush administration policies that he has criticized publicly, like tax cuts and the fiscal deficit, Mr. Rubin took the high road.“If you go over everything I have said, you would never see the word ‘Bush,’ ” he said. “I make a distinction between policy and politics. There are some immense issues — the stagnancy of real wages, economic security, the fiscal deficit. We are trying to stir debate.”True to his word, the initial output from the project has had a heavy, if not eye-glazing, emphasis on policy, and has been light on the politics. Among the topics tackled are the volatility of income levels, improving productivity of the federal government, and ensuring that free trade remains friendly to American workers. “When Bob Rubin and others are involved, it becomes an important vehicle,” said Orin S. Kramer, a hedge fund investor and a prominent Democratic fund-raiser. “And if you are trying to change the direction of policy, that is what politics is all about.”So while Mr. Rubin remains above the fray — he says he will not lend his support to any individual until the party chooses a Democratic candidate — most of the others he has recruited have already become fully engaged.Mr. Altman, a college classmate of President Clinton who also served briefly in his administration, has emerged as Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton’s leading economic adviser, and Mr. Perry, Mr. Steyer and some other financial executives have lent their financial support.The project is largely financed by Mr. Rubin and his financial backers, all of whom contribute an equal amount each year — said to be between $100,000 and $150,000 — to its approximately $2 million operating budget.As he has done in politics, Mr. Rubin has kept himself at a distant remove at Citigroup, his base of operations since 1999, particularly from the criticisms leveled at Mr. Prince over the bank’s sluggish growth.Partly this is a consequence of his unusual job description. As an executive at the company, he has no operational responsibility, and as a director he sits on no board committees (the executive committee, of which he is chairman, rarely meets). And partly it is a function of his personal style.“He has this enormous influence and yet he is not on the radar screen when people are looking to assign credit or blame,” said Michael Holland, an investor and longtime shareholder of Citigroup. “I presume it is very comfortable for him that way.”At Ford, where he was a director since 2000, he stepped down last month, citing banking conflicts.Still, there are some who have asked what it is that he does to earn his guaranteed $15 million a year. An influential rainmaker at the company, he meets frequently with clients in the public and private sectors. His outside interests are broad as well as time-consuming. As part of his contract, he is given free rein to indulge himself in this regard and to use Citigroup’s planes to do so.Last year, he booked $330,000 worth of personal travel time, almost three times as much as Mr. Prince logged, according to the bank’s proxy. Starting this year, he will reimburse Citigroup for his personal use of corporate aircraft.At Citigroup’s investor day last year, Michael L. Mayo, a bank analyst with Prudential Equity Group, put the question directly to Mr. Prince: What is it, exactly, that Mr. Rubin does?“He has been very, very important in our strategic thinking,” Mr. Prince replied. “Especially about international. Bob is a big influence in the place.”As a member of the chairman’s office with Mr. Prince and part of the committee of 12 business heads, Mr. Rubin has become a valued adviser, especially now, given the youth and untested qualities of Mr. Prince’s potential successors.“My office is right next to Chuck’s and he uses me as a sounding board,” said Mr. Rubin. Currently, a crucial matter of debate on the board has been how much Citigroup needs to invest in its investment bank and consumer franchise to make up for the years of neglect in these areas. Mr. Prince, with the support of Mr. Rubin, has been an advocate for an aggressive commitment of more resources. Other directors have been less enthusiastic as costs have increased.“I think he is on the right track,” Mr. Rubin said. “My impression of the board is that there is broad-base agreement to invest to get us where we need to be. If there is discussion, it’s a matter of degree and pace.”'"
"'06-09-08,'1','Nearly five years later, nonetheless, the tension between protecting civil liberties and preventing another terrorist attack remains at the center of post-9/11 American life, with the disclosure that the federal Education Department shared personal information on hundreds of student loan applicants with the Federal Bureau of Investigation.In 2005, Portland formally withdrew its Police Department from the Joint Terrorism Task Force of the F.B.I. Mr. Rogers approves of that position, though not necessarily with how civil liberties are protected elsewhere.“We should be very worried that the way Bush and his handlers are going about ‘defending the country’ is eroding the essence of our country,” he said. “Fortunately, history has shown that sooner of later Americans catch on to those who exploit fear, and we return to our true values.”Mr. Rogers grew up in what he called a “progressive Republican” household. His father, William P. Rogers, was attorney general in President Dwight D. Eisenhower’s second term and the first secretary of state under President Richard M. Nixon.When Nixon, as a congressman in the late 1940’s, pursued espionage accusations against Alger Hiss, he did so based on advice from William Rogers, then a committee counsel on Capitol Hill.“J. Edgar Hoover and Dad were pretty close, and I used to go to the firing range at the F.B.I. and all that stuff,” Jeffrey Rogers said. “I had a lot of respect for the F.B.I.”He graduated from Yale Law School in the same class as Bill and Hillary Rodham Clinton. There are pictures of them all clowning around after moot court.He campaigned for Mr. Clinton and has jogged with him in Oregon. Mr. Rogers is a Democrat and calls himself “pretty liberal.”Yet neither his Republican upbringing nor his Democratic views affected his actions in Portland in 2001, he said.All that mattered was the law, which a deputy first pointed out conflicted with Mr. Ashcroft’s request.“And I believe with no question that we were right in our interpretation,” he said. After 19 years in the city attorney’s office, Mr. Rogers left in 2004 to pursue a second career.He soon completed a master’s in counseling psychology and now spends his days listening to the troubles of others. His specialty, according to his business card, is “lawyers, clients of lawyers and others affected by the legal system.”In some circles, Mr. Rogers is bitterly recalled as the city attorney who fought the American government rather than the terrorists. To many others, his stance was heroic.“My favorite,” he said as he recalled one note, “was that I was ‘the Gandhi of Portland.’ I kept that.”'"
"'06-09-08,'1','Consider Loral Space and Communications, which many analysts thought would be dismembered when it sought bankruptcy protection in 2003, with more than $3 billion in debt. As trustee, Ms. Martini oversaw much of the Chapter 11 process as Loral sold satellites, reorganized and finally emerged from bankruptcy last November.In other cases, Ms. Martini took on a broader role.In late 2005, when Delta Air Lines, under bankruptcy protection, and its pilots were warring over wage issues, Ms. Martini spent six days mediating last-ditch negotiations between the sides. The outcome was an agreement on temporary givebacks that averted a potentially fatal strike.Delta expects to emerge from bankruptcy next year.Being a federal trustee meant tackling sensitive issues, including fee applications from lawyers and financial advisers. It was Ms. Martini’s responsibility to object when she felt that a company, a creditor or an adviser was making a request that would hurt the integrity of the bankruptcy system, sometimes disagreeing with debtors and creditors alike.She did not always win. In January, Ms. Martini argued that the judge in the case of the brokerage firm Refco “usurped the role of the U.S. Trustee” in rejecting her request that a Chapter 11 trustee be brought in to run the firm, which had collapsed after disclosing $430 million in hidden debt. Her motion to reconsider the decision was denied.As appointees of the Justice Department, trustees must also worry about their relations with Washington. Though she declined to discuss details, Ms. Martini said that increased oversight of her position created “challenges” that contributed to her decision to return to the private sector.But rather than leave the bankruptcy arena, Ms. Martini has taken her experience to the financing side of the business.She joined the CIT Group in July as a senior restructuring adviser and managing director, and will assist CIT, a commercial and consumer lender, as it seeks to provide financing to companies in financial distress.Lending to bankrupt companies might seem counterintuitive, but it can be highly profitable, providing high interest rate returns, lucrative fees and many protections against default. Many hedge funds, investment pools catering to institutional investors and the wealthy, have embraced the business in recent years, attracted by its high returns and relatively low risk.Called debtor-in-possession loans, “they are some of the safest loans anybody can make,” said Margot B. Schonholtz, co-chairwoman of the bankruptcy practice at the Kaye Scholer law firm in New York. The bankruptcy code allows debtor-in-possession lenders to be put ahead of other creditors in the line to be paid and to receive liens on a bankrupt company’s assets.For CIT, debtor-in-possession loans are part of a larger portfolio that includes loans to healthy, mostly midsize companies. With some rating agencies forecasting a rise in default rates, though, these loans may play a bigger role in the next year or so.Ms. Martini said the lull in corporate defaults might be nearing an end. She suspects that bankruptcies might rise in the telecom, paper and real estate development industries. More fallout in the auto sector would not be surprising either, she said.Whether or not the bankruptcy drought is over, Ms. Martini said the time was right for her to return to the private sector. She spent 11 years, from 1988 to 1999, as an assistant United States attorney for the District of Connecticut, where she represented federal agencies in bankruptcy proceedings and prosecuted bankruptcy fraud cases. In 2003, the Justice Department named her United States Trustee for the region including New York. In between those jobs, she was chairwoman of the restructuring practice at the law firm of Ivey, Barnum & O’Mara.Despite the occasional conflict, Ms. Martini has won accolades from her peers. She was named the 2006 Woman of the Year by the International Women’s Insolvency and Restructuring Confederation, an association of women lawyers, financial advisers and others in the turnaround business.She has also managed her family life.When Delta Air Lines and Northwest Airlines filed for protection on the same day last September, Ms. Martini was there.Marshall Huebner of Davis Polk & Wardwell, who leads the team advising Delta in its bankruptcy, said he sent Ms. Martini documents “in the high hundreds of pages” before his client’s filing date on Sept. 14, which was also the birthday of Ms. Martini’s son.After a hectic day shuttling between courtrooms, “I still made it home in time for the party,” she recently recalled.'"
"'06-09-08,'1','At 40 minutes, the speech was one of the longest — if not the longest — that Mr. Corzine has delivered since taking office in January. But business is a subject that Mr. Corzine feels passionately about, and knows quite well, having served as co-chairman of Goldman Sachs.Many business leaders and elected officials had been anticipating the speech for weeks, hopeful that, given his Wall Street background, Mr. Corzine would offer new ideas or practices to stimulate the economy.Many were also optimistic that Mr. Corzine’s point person on the plan — Gary D. Rose, director of the new Office of Economic Growth, who is a former colleague of Mr. Corzine’s at Goldman Sachs — would be motivated more by business than by politics.Most groups — businesses, educators, environmentalists — responded enthusiastically to the address.“For the first time in years, we have a comprehensive plan to tackle many of the problems that have been holding our private-sector economy back,” said Philip Kirschner, president of the New Jersey Business and Industry Association. “Gov. Jon Corzine has picked up on many of the key issues facing employers. This is a report that attempts to build on the state’s strengths and address the problems that many businesses face.”Environmentalists said they were pleased that Mr. Corzine had talked about alternative energy and redevelopment of brownfields — former industrial sites where there may be contaminants — as examples of how to balance economic development with environmental considerations.“He laid out a creditable skeleton,” said David Pringle, campaign director of the New Jersey Environmental Federation. “Now he’s got to put the right meat on the bones.”But there was a degree of skittishness as well because of recent economic trends. On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia projected that economic growth in New Jersey would be only 0.6 percent during the next nine months, the slowest rate in nearly five years.Although the bank based its projection on an increase in initial unemployment claims, a drop in housing permits and paltry growth in private-sector jobs, some Republicans noted that Mr. Corzine recently had raised the sales tax to 7 percent from 6 percent to help plug a $4 billion budget deficit.“While I commend Mr. Rose and the governor on recognizing the challenges we have in overcoming the complicated bureaucracy, and while I think the process part is relevant, I do think the issue is more fundamental than that, and it relates to the very high tax burden in New Jersey,” the Senate minority leader, Leonard Lance, said.As an indication of the plan’s importance to the Corzine administration, Mr. Rose was joined by 10 other cabinet officers to elaborate on the plan at a news conference after the governor spoke.In his speech, Mr. Corzine acknowledged that the state would have to do more with fewer resources. But he said that money could be saved by reducing the number of agencies involved in development, perhaps streamlining the bureaucracy under the aegis of either the state’s Economic Development Authority or the newly created 36-member Economic Growth Council.Mr. Corzine also promised that the state would gauge the effectiveness of incentive and grant programs for businesses. But as an example of just how stiff the competition would be, Mr. Corzine noted that during a recent trade mission to China, he encountered two other states there embarking on similar ventures.“If you don’t ask for the trade, in the world that I came from,” said Mr. Corzine, who spent most of his career at Goldman Sachs as a bond trader, “you don’t get it.”'"
"'06-09-08,'1','Michael Goldberger, a former director of admissions for Brown University, is quoted here as acknowledging that “having a building named after your family on our campus would be a plus factor.” Point taken — but Mr. Golden goes much further. His book is the season’s barnburner because it cites specific donations, test scores and even essay topics that are linked to questionably qualified applicants. Their names are named.“The Price of Admission” describes “development admits” — applicants with family money but no previous ties to Duke University, the most egregious offender cited here — as “the dirty little secret of college admissions.” Somehow he knows that Dhani Harrison, who went to Brown, wrote an admissions essay about playing music onstage with his father, the Beatle, and Eric Clapton — and that celebrity-mongering Brown was suitably impressed.Mr. Golden’s dishy, mean-spirited book delivers a mixed message: that although prominent institutions select students unfairly, applicants should still be fighting their ways into these same unscrupulous colleges. A how-to guide, “The New Rules of College Admissions: Ten Former Admissions Officers Reveal What It Takes to Get Into College Today,” raises the ante by suggesting that every applicant needs a theme. (“That girl is going to be president someday!”) No wonder America’s schoolkids have a collective headache.And as described by Alexandra Robbins in “The Overachievers: The Secret Lives of Driven Kids,” they are all but strangled by creeping Ivy, in the form of college-application consultants with names like IvyWise and the Ivy Guaranteed Admissions Program. Ms. Robbins describes a boy who, in light of this pressure, finds it no coincidence that “SAT” overlaps with the name Satan.She also scares one counselor into ditching a teenage client when the client becomes one of Ms. Robbins’s interview subjects. The student could tarnish the counselor’s reputation by failing to get into an important college.Ms. Robbins takes a soapy reality-show approach as she tracks a cross-section of high school hopefuls through the admissions gantlet. Her book is more anecdotal and less biting than Mr. Golden’s. But she does illustrate the scope of the problem by showing that it’s a short leap from identifying flash cards when applying to kindergarten (“letter, whale, broom, plug, snail, camel, shovel”) to the full kiddie rat race.Similarly, in “Hothouse Kids: The Dilemma of the Gifted Child,” Alissa Quart describes an experiment measuring how big expectations warp young prodigies. Some children who participated in I.Q. testing were randomly told they were gifted. That reduced both their ability to work persistently and their capacity for enjoyment.“Hothouse Kids” is a more serious study than “The Case Against Homework: How Homework Is Hurting Our Children and What We Can Do About It.” This blander book presents unsurprising evidence that today’s school workloads can be monstrous. Witness the kindergarten girl from Fairbanks, Alaska, who from 5:30 to 6 each day “needs cajoling from parent to do homework, while parent tries to cook dinner.”On this book’s back cover, it is suggested by Dan Kindlon, Ph.D., that every parent in America buy a copy of “The Case Against Homework” — even though Dr. Kindlon now has his own “Alpha Girls” to recommend. “Alpha Girls” reflects the kind of firsthand perspective that colors many such studies of schoolchildren.As the father of two teenage girls, Dr. Kindlon feels that father-daughter connections are important and empowering in creating successful alpha personalities. His book has a chart to prove that girls with good relationships with their fathers have high self-esteem. Another shows that the majority of alpha girls disagree with the statement “I am shy.”Although “Alpha Girls” means to combat the idea of stifled female ambition, its central insight is nothing new. The alpha was a smart cookie even when she was known as a coed.“College Girls: Bluestockings, Sex Kittens and Coeds, Then and Now” is an entertaining work of feminist history that digs up every conceivable manifestation of the she-student, from novelty item to fashion plate to trendsetter. It helps to know that even when an advertisement for fruit might feature a pretty model in cap and gown (courtesy of the College Heights Orange and Lemon Association), and girls were offered advice by books like “Co-Ediquette” (“if he gets amorous, don’t wander alone with him in the moonlight”), they were still alpha enough to resist the brainwashing.Whatever their sex, college students risk overreacting to years’ worth of torment once they finally leave home. What happens at college once they get there? “From Binge to Blackout: A Mother and Son Struggle With Teen Drinking” is an especially gripping cautionary tale on this subject. And it is unusual in that it does not follow the standard story template, from downfall to miracle cure. Instead this account is divided between two narrators: Toren Volkmann, who slid with scary ease from fun-loving party guy to desperate alcoholic, and Chris Volkmann, his mother, who bought Toren’s assurances that he was fine. He had a secret, and she hadn’t a clue.In light of all this, perhaps there’s a lot to be said for armchair academia, the kind best reached via someone else’s imagination. A covert enjoyment of numbers, puzzles, cognitive tricks and pattern recognition fueled the vast popularity of the novel “The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time” — even though the author, Mark Haddon, has not replicated this gambit in his new novel, “A Spot of Bother.” Instead this season’s schoolbook of choice is Marisha Pessl’s “Special Topics in Calamity Physics,” a novel that trades on classroom cachet.With chapters named for famously great books, this showily erudite novel has a prep school for its setting. It has a bright young student as its narrator, and a mysterious teacher at the center of its plot. Best of all, it comes with a final exam. And as Ms. Pessl puts it, in a last sentence that’s a lovely feat of school mimicry: “Take all the time you need.”'"
"'06-09-08,'1','Completed in 1916, “The Planets” is in seven movements, each devoted to an orb and its astrological character: Mars, the Bringer of War; Venus, the Bringer of Peace; Mercury, the Winged Messenger; Jupiter, the Bringer of Jollity; Saturn, the Bringer of Old Age; Uranus, the Magician; and Neptune, the Mystic. Mr. Matthews calls his movement “Pluto, the Renewer.”Mr. Holst excluded the Earth, because it has no astrological significance, and Pluto, which was not discovered until 1930. He died in 1934, but there is little evidence that he considered updating his piece.“The Planets” quickly became a beloved and influential work, perhaps the best-known piece by a 20th-century Briton. Film music composers dine on it often. Mr. Holst himself, an unpretentious introvert, was taken aback by its success, and he turned away from it stylistically. None of his other pieces made as much impact or are played much nowadays.Pluto’s demotion last month seems to have stirred up interest in the new CD, which was released in Europe early last month, said Stephen Johns, the album’s producer. It is too early for sales figures, he said.“It’s completely fortuitous,” Mr. Johns added. “It’s heightened the awareness of ‘The Planets’ in general. Hopefully there’ll be some effect. It’s just curious and a lovely coincidence.” Really, an “alignment of the stars,” he felt forced to say.Sir Simon did not respond to messages left with the Berlin Philharmonic — a spokeswoman said he was rehearsing — but he issued a statement after the astronomical union’s announcement saying he was happy Pluto was no longer “out there all on his own.” He called it an opportunity to commission more astronomical music. “Who knows, the whole suite could last a fortnight,” he said.In its own way “Pluto, the Renewer” has been a 21st-century success. It has been recorded three times previously and performed more than 100 times, unusual exposure for a contemporary classical piece. Mr. Matthews acknowledges that the Holstian hook helped.He was the man to write it. Mr. Matthews edited the score of “The Planets” with Mr. Holst’s daughter, Imogen, and is chairman of the Holst Foundation. He calls his work more of an appendix than a completion of “The Planets,” without any real reference to Pluto’s character (or that of its namesake, the Disney dog). He said he had tried to avoid writing a Holst “pastiche,” although inevitably some ideas crept in, like the militaristic rhythms of “Mars.”Mr. Matthews took as his starting point the idea of solar winds, and the movement is full of swift, swirling passages. It is designed to begin seamlessly with the close of “The Planets,” and it, too, ends quietly.Mr. Matthews said he did not want to try to top the mysterious, otherworldly quality of Mr. Holst’s closing movement, “Neptune,” the most remote planet when Mr. Holst wrote the piece (and again now).“It would have had to have been very small and slow and quiet and cold,” Mr. Matthews said.'"
"'06-09-08,'1','For months the prime minister fought off calls to name a date for stepping down, despite the increasing fears that a delay would hurt his party in the next election and the growing unpopularity at home for his firm backing of American policy in Iraq and the Middle East.It is not clear whether the political costs of allying Britain so closely to the United States would prompt Mr. Brown to change course, though his political allies have suggested that he is eager to bring home British troops from Afghanistan and Iraq and would strike a more independent stance. Mr. Brown’s brief has been managing the British economy, not foreign policy.In his televised announcement from a schoolyard, Mr. Blair, alternately somber and testy, refused to name a specific date, saying he would act on his own timetable. It was not clear if that was enough to silence his critics, or whether further political bloodletting was in store.An hour before Mr. Blair spoke, Mr. Brown pulled back from a final showdown with his onetime ally, pledging to abide by Mr. Blair’s decision on timing. The choreography of the appearances suggested that Mr. Brown was signaling his supporters to suspend their rebellion and observe what may be an uneasy truce. Indeed, the eight ministers who resigned from Mr. Blair’s government on Wednesday, calling on him to step down, remained silent on Thursday.Temporarily at least, the maneuver spared Mr. Blair the same immediate fate as Margaret Thatcher, forced out of office by her own party in 1990 after months of maneuvering.“I think the precise timetable has to be left up to me and got to be done in a proper way,” Mr. Blair said.Speaking an hour earlier, Mr. Brown said, “I want to make it absolutely clear today that when I met the prime minister yesterday, I said to him and I repeat today: It is for him to make the decision” on the timing of his departure.Taken together, the two speeches seemed intended to calm the turmoil within Labor’s ranks that risks imperiling the party’s electoral prospects. “We cannot treat the public as irrelevant bystanders in a subject as important as who is their prime minister,” Mr. Blair warned.“It has been a somewhat difficult week, but I think it’s time now to move on, and I think we will,” he said. It was not clear whether his tattered authority could sustain his ability to do that.Doug Henderson, a Labor legislator and supporter of Mr. Brown, indicated that the pressure for an earlier ouster of Mr. Blair had not disappeared. ‘’People keep saying to me that the Labor Party must have a clear direction forward with clear priorities and a new leader before the elections in 2007,” he told Reuters.The calculations underpinning both men’s behavior emerged from conversations with politicians and associates in both camps, some of whom requested anonymity because they were not authorized to reveal confidences.A member of the Blair camp said that, before the summer break, Mr. Blair had told a close friend that he was coming under renewed pressure from Mr. Brown to name a date he would step down, but the friend had advised him not to because that would rob Mr. Blair of his remaining power. Mr. Blair followed this advice, hoping the pressure would decrease after the summer break.But Mr. Brown continued to press, a person close to his camp said. His allies were provoked by an interview with The Times of London on Friday in which Mr. Blair refused to set a date and by a memo, leaked to The Mirror, which showed Mr. Blair’s plans for a drawn-out farewell.“Brown had no choice but to act to put Blair in a position to name a date,” said John Kampfner, editor of The New Statesman magazine, who has close links to Mr. Brown. “Brown knew that it would be horrible, but he thought, Let’s have one terrible week and get something than having it drag on for weeks.”Mark Leonard, a British policy expert who ran a research organization championed by Mr. Blair, said Mr. Brown had calculated that he needed to act soon because another challenger for the leadership might emerge. Charles Clarke, former home secretary, has been making a series of recent speeches that have been seen as preparation for a leadership challenge.“What is holding Brown back is that he does not want to give his party a habit of rebellion and insurrection,” Mr. Leonard said. “That is not the way he wants to start his new government.”The political stagecraft was evident even in the choice of a school as backdrop for Mr. Blair’s announcement, because Mr. Blair wants to be seen not just as a warrior but also as a leader who enhanced public services like schools, policing and health care.For his part, Mr. Brown, less charismatic than Mr. Blair, has been a Labor Party stalwart throughout his political life, taking credit as finance minister for a remarkable era of economic growth.His main contacts with American politicians have been with Treasury Department and banking officials on issues like reducing third-world debt and managing shocks to the global economy. Closer to home, in Europe, he has been more of a euro-skeptic than Mr. Blair, opposed to joining the euro single currency.At the same time, he has tried to build an image as a champion of the poor.Last April, he visited Africa — paying a call on Nelson Mandela and posing for photographs with children in shanty towns — apparently to soften his public persona as a dour and austere “Iron Chancellor,” a closet old-school socialist bent on taxing the middle classes to redistribute wealth.The crisis this week has been building since the election two years ago, and sharpened over the summer when Mr. Blair rejected calls from Labor legislators to support a quick cease-fire in Lebanon, preferring to endorse American and Israeli policies.Then, last Friday, Mr. Blair gave an interview to The Times of London, telling his critics to stop “obsessing” over his departure, which outraged Mr. Brown’s allies. On Wednesday, Mr. Brown and Mr. Blair had a private meeting described in some newspaper reports as a shouting match. But by Thursday both men seemed to calculate that they needed to back away from a showdown that would have damaged them both.Moreover, continuing political warfare could deepen Labor’s unpopularity in advance of regional elections next May. A full national vote, to decide which party would run the government, is scheduled for 2010 at the latest.Mr. Blair took power in 1997 on a wave of euphoria that built as he struck the 1998 Northern Ireland peace agreement and, with Mr. Brown running the economy, opened the country to a remarkable period of low unemployment and low interest rates.In foreign affairs, he built a close relationship with President Bill Clinton and took a prominent role in the Kosovo war. He won another landslide in June 2001.But it was on Sept. 11, 2001, that Mr. Blair’s premiership changed. He became a close ally of President Bush, first in the Afghanistan war and then in Iraq — a war that was deeply unpopular among many Britons, including Muslims, who argued that the vision of British troops fighting in Islamic countries as allies of the United States exposed the country to terrorist attacks.In the last national elections in May 2005, Mr. Blair won again but with a much reduced majority, after campaigning with Mr. Brown at his side to shore up his support. The vote was the first time a Labor leader had won a third straight victory.At the same time, Mr. Blair lost the trust of many Britons because he insisted that the invasion of Iraq was needed to counter an imminent threat from Saddam Hussein’s weapons of mass destruction, though no such weapons were found.At home, his administration has been dogged by scandals in recent months relating to campaign financing and the personal behavior of some of his ministers.As he seeks to emerge from the current crisis, Mr. Blair risks being seen as losing authority, not just at home but also abroad. He is planning a visit to Israel, Lebanon and the Palestinian territories in the next few days but, reports from the West Bank said on Thursday, Palestinians are reluctant to welcome him because of his refusal to seek an early cease-fire in the Lebanon war.'"
"'06-09-08,'1','ANYONE who has ever eaten an apple picked straight off the tree, or tasted fresh homemade apple butter, knows what a treat the early autumn apple harvest season is. And there are ways to get closer to it than your local supermarket. This autumn, orchards and towns across the United States — from Springville, Calif., to Castleton, N.Y. — will be celebrating the harvest. With around 7,500 commercial apple growers in 36 states, there are many apple festivals to choose from.Apple season in North America is nearly four months long, according to the U.S. Apple Association, an industry group based in Vienna, Va. American growers produce about 100 varieties of apples, and harvest time depends on the types grown and the regional climate. The harvest of Honeycrisps and Galas usually starts in late August, while varieties like the Cripps Pink and Fuji are picked as late as early December.Peak season in most places and for many favorite varieties, however, falls in September and early October. “Now, obviously, is the best time to get apples, no matter where you’re getting them, as they’re coming straight off the trees,” said Shannon Schaffer, a spokesman for the association.Most apple festivals center on a variety of enjoyable and tasty things to do with the apples themselves. Pie-eating, apple-peeling and baking competitions are standard, and a host of local apple-butter and cider vendors offer their goods. Some of the larger festivals, like the one that draws about 35,000 people every fall in Warwick, N.Y., about an hour from New York City, have added more arts and crafts booths and rides.Other communities use their apple festivals to show off distinctive local cultures. Nappanee, Ind., a small town with Victorian-era buildings about 25 miles south of the Michigan border, lies in the heart of Indiana Amish country. In addition to the on-site apple butter making, live country music and many other apple-related events at its festival, Nappanee adds celebrations of Amish furniture and opportunities to sample the Amish haystack meal — a traditional local dish consisting of rice, lettuce, hamburger and onions, formed into the shape of a haystack.'"

Conservative Muslims have long considered dogs unclean, though some Arabs keep them for hunting.

"'06-09-09,'0','Polansky said doctors had no explanation for his sleepwalking. They told him it was not typical of someone his age. He said he had no history of it and has not done it since.As a precaution, Polansky said, he now shares a room with at least two other people and tries to book first-floor rooms. On the night of his accident, he was alone in the room. Polansky’s tennis has not suffered. In August, less than two months after returning from the accident, he won the Canadian Open, the seventh International Tennis Federation junior title of his career.At this Open, Polansky defeated the No. 1-seeded Martin Klizan in the second round. He is in the semifinals of a junior Grand Slam for the second time — the first was in Australia this year.“I knew I was going to play, I just wasn’t expecting everything would be going this well,” said Polansky, who is ranked 69th on the I.T.F. junior circuit.NAVRATILOVA LOOKS AHEAD If Martina Navratilova does retire after this tournament, she will play the final match of her career today — joining with Bob Bryan in the mixed doubles final against Martin Damm and Kveta Peschke.“I’m so thrilled to look forward to the rest of my life,” said Navratilova, who will turn 50 in October. “My biggest sadness I have is that I will never play tennis as well as I’m playing it right now. It’s just time to move on and do other things.”Her future plans include spending more time with her partner, promoting her recently released book on staying in shape and perhaps television broadcasting. Navratilova said she also wanted to spend more time promoting the Rainbow Card, a credit card she created that supports lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender causes.All that, she said, would keep her away from the game, even though she felt physically capable of playing for another couple of years. Navratilova retired once before, from 1995 to 2000.Although the mixed doubles is not one of the main attractions here, Navratilova has scouted all of her opponents and yesterday was on the practice court longer than Bryan, who is nearly 22 years younger.“It’s a Grand Slam event, baby,” she said. “It’s a Grand Slam title. When you count the titles, they don’t say, ‘Oh, by the way, they played on the side court.’ ”'"
"'06-09-09,'0','African Union officers repeatedly spoke of the frustrations of what has become an impossible mission — to oversee a peace deal most of the militants in this brutal conflict have signed and to monitor a cease-fire that hardly anyone respects. Most spoke on the condition of anonymity because they are not authorized to speak publicly about African Union activities.“We are frustrated and feeling so useless,” said one major from southern Africa based in Kebkabiya, a government-controlled town that is home to thousands of people displaced by the conflict. “We are not able to move freely and do our work. Sometimes I wonder if there is any reason for us to be here at all.”But as weak as the African Union force is, nearly all agree it is better than none at all. Frantic diplomatic negotiations are now taking place to make sure some kind of peacekeeping force remains in Darfur, where hundreds of thousands of people have died and 2.5 million have been pushed from their homes in the fighting.The African Union force is almost out of money, and its sponsors, mainly the United States and Europe, have said that they will pay no more. The force says it will leave after its mandate expires Sept. 30.Sudan has offered to pay the force’s budget with money raised by the Arab League and Sudan itself. But that would give the government even more leverage over the force, and senior African Union officials have dismissed the idea as unacceptable.More than being underfunded, however, the peacekeepers here lack the ability to stand up to the Sudanese government, according to senior officers, analysts and diplomats.“The African Union has never been a big nuisance and nor was it a big threat,” said J. Stephen Morrison, director of the Africa program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.“The Sudanese always had an A.U. that was split in its opinion and never had the rules of engagement or the capacity to push them around,” he added. “So it was vulnerable to being manipulated and weakened along the way.”Those are problems that any new United Nations force would undoubtedly want to fix. But Sudan has argued that a United Nations force will undermine the country’s sovereignty by transferring too much authority to outsiders. A lack of authority is precisely what many African Union officers here lamented.“A peacekeeping force must assert its authority, so when I arrived and saw that a party to the conflict had control of the airstrip I knew this mission was in trouble,” said one senior African Union military official who has served in peacekeeping missions in Europe, Africa and Asia.“If the only airstrip you have is freely not accessible, then you know who has the authority, and it is not you,” he said.Gen. Collins Ihekire, the Nigerian who commands the African Union forces in Darfur, acknowledged in an interview that the force has not had always has the freedom and support it needs to carry out even its limited mission.“We have not always had the ability to move as freely as we would like,” he said, “but we are not here to force a confrontation with anyone. We are here as monitors of a cease-fire, not to make war.”In the past week, as the showdown over an international force has mounted, African soldiers have curtailed their already limited patrols, often at the insistence of Sudanese officers stationed in their bases as monitors of a tattered cease-fire agreement.A short patrol Tuesday to visit outlying villages and areas frequented by nomads on their annual migration route near Kebkabiya was a case in point. According to its mandate, the African Union is supposed to be able to move freely throughout Darfur without any impediments, such as the travel permits required for aid workers and journalists wanting to visit the region.But in practice, the movements of the African Union have been hampered by government officials. A Sudanese Army captain assigned to the Kebkabiya base tried to prevent a patrol from visiting villages in the area, relenting only when the Cameroonian major who was leading the patrol firmly insisted that it go ahead.On the patrol, the Sudanese captain repeatedly told villagers not to speak to visiting journalists and not to allow the journalists to take photographs.Such interference is a violation of the African force’s independence, but the policy of the force has been to avoid confrontation rather than testing the limits of its mandate.The African Union was always meant to be a short-term solution to stanch bloodshed and allow aid workers to operate in Darfur while negotiations for a political solution took place, Mr. Morrison said.“There were no other options, and they stepped into the breach and they did it with limited capacity,” Mr. Morrison said. “They acquitted themselves pretty well, and they showed courage and didn’t shy away from ugliness and risk. But it wasn’t sustainable.”The peace agreement signed between one of the rebel factions and the Arab-dominated government in May was supposed to be that political solution, but some of the non-Arab rebel factions have rejected it, as have millions of Darfur residents.But the government, insisting it has reached a political settlement with those willing to make peace, has started a military offensive against the rebel alliance that refused to sign, bombing villages they control.This is a violation of the new peace agreement, according to African Union officials, but its troops watch helplessly as the Antonov bombers and attack helicopters take off from the El Fasher airstrip.Still, whatever its shortcomings, shoring up the African Union without a commitment on the United Nations force may be the only option left, short of abandoning Darfur without any peacekeepers at all, said Eltayeb Hag Ateya, director of the Peace Research Institute at the University of Khartoum.“Clearly the short-term solution is to support the African Union force,” Mr. Ateya said. “We need to think practically and put politics aside to find peace.”'"
"'06-09-09,'0','WASHINGTON, Sept. 8 (Reuters) — The Bush administration raised the pressure on Iran on Friday, cutting off one of its main state-owned banks from any dealings with the United States financial system.The action against the bank, Bank Saderat, was announced by Stuart Levey, the Treasury under secretary for terrorism and financial intelligence, in a speech to the conservative American Enterprise Institute.Washington is trying to win approval at the United Nations for imposing sanctions on Iran over its refusal to obey a United Nations order to halt nuclear enrichment activities by Aug. 31. Mr. Levey is heading for Europe this weekend for talks next week on how to further limit Iran’s access to the global financial system.The State Department spokesman, Sean McCormack, said the action against the Iranian bank was part of a broader effort to curb Iran’s nuclear efforts and discourage its support of terrorist groups.“This is certainly an example of the variety of different levers that are available, not only to the United States, but other countries as well, about how to bring about a change in behavior in the Iranian regime,” he said.'"
"'06-09-09,'0','The music all night was well played by Ermanno Florio and the Houston Ballet Orchestra; and Robert Brewer handled the Poulenc organ part authoritatively, even if his impressively real-sounding electronic organ seemed too loud and off-center from the side speakers.Mr. Tetley matches the gravity of the music without slavish imitation. There are lively bits, but they recede into the overall somber mood. The whole thing, with its solemn processionals and adagio partnering, might have looked prosaic except for the excellence of the performance, the best of the entire program, which was coached by Mr. Tetley and an assistant. (Nicely, all three choreographers were on hand to acknowledge the applause.)Particularly impressive was Sara Webb in the central couple, surely but deferentially partnered by Connor Walsh. Ms. Webb’s technical security and musicality and utter confidence in the phrasing and the lifts made the ballet cohere into something moving and important.The whole program labored under the title “Simple Elegance,” which smacked of marketing. Mixed bills are a harder sell than big-story ballets, classic or pop, and the 2,400-seat Brown Theater in the Wortham Theater Center was not full.Elegance, simple or otherwise, didn’t really describe Mr. Tetley’s work nor Mr. van Manen’s “Grosse Fuge,” which opens the proceedings. This uses Beethoven’s “Grosse Fuge” from the Op. 133 String Quartet and the Cavatina from the Op. 130 Quartet, both in their string-orchestra arrangements.It is set for four men, in black pants with connecting fabric that look like skirts, until they strip them off to reveal black briefs. The women are in white leotards and tights. The men wear leather belts that, as things heat up, the women grab suggestively. The blend of formalism, muscle-flexing, erotic tension and sweaty sexuality sits a little oddly, especially in conjunction with Beethoven’s noblest music. But it certainly projects a strong personality.The program ends with Mr. Welch’s “Brigade,” which uses Britten’s “Matinées Musicales” and “Soirées Musicales” in the service of a cheesy-looking balletic operetta. One would like to think irony was intended, but one fears not.The dancers are dressed in vaguely Ruritanian costumes, the men in military, the women in stiff tutus. There are even chandeliers. Everyone acts like puppets. The short numbers do not, on the whole, stretch the dancers technically, although the three men in the March — Oliver Halkowich, Ilya Kozadayev and Shingo Yoshimoto on Thursday — were fun to watch, and Randy Herrera and Leticia Oliveira had the requisite bravado in the Tarantella.But after the earnestness of “Voluntaries,” Mr. Welch’s effort ends the evening with pure, calculated sugar shock.'"

Both sides said at the time that they expected Mr. Peltz and his company, the Trian Group, to win some seats on the board, but they did not know how many.“This is a big victory for all Heinz shareholders,” Trian said in a statement after the announcement. Neither Mr. Peltz nor Mr. Weinstein could be reached for further comment.Heinz portrayed the outcome as a victory of its own, citing the fact that 10 of its 12 incumbent directors were re-elected. Peter Coors, vice chairman of the Molson Coors Brewing Company, and Mary Choksi, managing director of two investment firms, lost their seats.A Molson Coors spokeswoman said Mr. Coors had no comment.

And Amanda Plummer is all over her like a swarm of drugged Southern bees in Hartford Stage’s heartfelt and heart-wrenching new production of “Summer and Smoke.”Tennessee Williams often said that Miss Alma, as almost everyone calls her, was his finest female character and the one most like him. She is a Mississippi minister’s daughter, still relatively young in the years just before World War I but already spinsterish, admiring of the “everlasting struggle” between good and evil represented by Gothic cathedrals, and eventually dependent on and grateful for “little mercies,” like her prescription for sleeping tablets.Ever since her mother turned into a mental infant, Alma has been responsible for the running of the household. She is dutiful but angry (“You act like a child, but you have the Devil in you,” she tells her mother) and occasionally vengeful. There is not an uncomplicated or stereotypical bone in Alma’s body, and Ms. Plummer adds complexities and vulnerabilities of her own.Alma’s problem is that she has been in love since childhood with the golden boy next door, John Buchanan Jr., played with easy Redfordish charm by Marc Kudisch.That’s Doctor Buchanan. But John’s problem is that he isn’t much interested in taking over his respected father’s medical practice. He prefers to spend his time drinking and carousing with fast women like Rosa Gonzalez (Stephanie Beatriz), whose father owns the local casino.Williams almost always throws an exotic “foreign” character or two into his company of mostly genteel white Southerners. In this case he doesn’t have anything nice to say about Latinos. Rosa exists only as a giggly sexual object, and Papa Gonzales (Mateo Gómez) is depicted as loud, drunken, greedy and violent.'"

"'06-09-10,'0','But Sharapova needed very little help on court against Henin-Hardenne, a five-time major champion who would have returned to No. 1 in the rankings with a victory.In the men's final Sunday, No. 1 Roger Federer will be bidding for his ninth career Grand Slam title when he takes on No. 9 Andy Roddick, aiming for his second.In contrast to Henin-Hardenne, in more traditional tennis attire topped by a white ballcap, Sharapova wore her night-match getup, a black, cocktail dress-type number replete with a sparkled collar, accessorized with silver shoes and dangling earrings. Sharapova says the look is inspired by ""Breakfast at Tiffany's,"" but the guess here is Audrey Hepburn never had a sponsor's swoosh on her outfit.Sharapova makes about $20 million a year from endorsement deals, and she signed a ""lifetime"" contract with her racket maker shortly before the U.S. Open began.In the final's second game, a man's voice came from the sellout crowd of 23,712, screaming the tag line from Sharapova's oft-played current TV ad: ""I feel pretty!""In the commercial, that tune is sung by various people as Sharapova walks out onto court for a match. The punch line: Sharapova swings her racket and lets out one of her trademark shrieks.Those high-pitched screams were muted at the start of the match, but within a few games, Sharapova was wailing as loudly as ever. Not that Henin-Hardenne was silent, punctuating points won by letting out, ""Allez!""Sharapova won the coin toss and elected to receive, then went out and stood right at the baseline while Henin-Hardenne hit practice serves at the end of the warmup session. Picture Yankees shortstop Derek Jeter getting to take batting practice against Red Sox starter Curt Schilling -- it just doesn't happen in other sports.Perhaps Sharapova noticed something, because she immediately earned two break points in the match's opening game. Henin-Hardenne saved both, then broke for a 2-0 edge with the aid of two double-faults by Sharapova.But Sharapova broke right back -- one free point came on a double-fault -- and in the process came up with the shot of the evening: a half-volley drop winner to close a 10-stroke exchange.After her own early loss of serve, Sharapova buckled down in that regard: She didn't face a break point the rest of the match.Pretty impressive against a player of Henin-Hardenne's caliber. The Belgian entered the night leading all women in matches won (54), Grand Slam matches won (25) and tournament titles (five).Henin-Hardenne finally succumbed to Sharapova's power and relentless shotmaking. At 3-3 in the third set came the final, key break of serve, after Henin-Hardenne led 40-15. She missed two backhands and double-faulted; after saving one break point, she set up another by sailing a forehand long. Under pressure from Sharapova's groundstrokes, Henin-Hardenne dumped a forehand into the net, making it 4-3. Sharapova yelled ""Come on!"" and jogged to the changeover.""Come on!"" from someone born in Siberia? Well, Sharapova has made her home in Florida since she was 7. After trying to call someone with her cellphone while waiting for the trophy ceremony, Sharapova leaned forward in her chair and said, ""This is crazy!""'"

"'06-09-10,'0','HEROES are made by luck, will, circumstanceand the kind of exaggerationsthat always follow exceptionalactions of some sort. Huey P.Newton founded the Black Panther Party forSelf-Defense with Bobby Seale in 1966, the yearthat black power darkened the skies of the civilrights movement. In beret and black leatherjacket, Newton presented himself as a manwho had no patience for nonviolence and wouldno longer accept violent action against blackpeople without retaliating. Echoing MalcolmX, he promised to live by the gun in order togain the respect that black people, supposedly,had never shown the courage to demand. ""Byany means necessary"" became the watchwordof the Black Panthers, which meant that allwas possible in the name of black revolution.Though he had survived a gunfight with the police, imprisonment and a number of assassinationplots, real or imagined, Newton died in thedark bed that he had made for himself and thatonly those close to him knew about.Newton had a cocaine habit that made hispersonality mercurial and may have providedthe impetus to shift his organization into seriouscrime by the early 1970's. Fawned over bythe New Left, the news media and Hollywood,he was transformed into a messiah expected tofill ever bigger shoes. Newton became so unhingedby megalomania that his increasinglyirrational decisions brought about the dissolutionof the Black Panther Party, which hadgiven him his moment on the national and internationalstage.He was killed in 1989 on the streets of Oaklandby a member of the dope-hustling crewcalled the Black Guerrilla Family, which had,following Newton's lead, associated its criminalactivities with radical politics — revolution, ifyou will. The death of Newton had nothing to dowith politics of any sort. The three shots the formersymbol of radical politics took to the headwere a dealer's expression of intimidation andrage for having been bullied into giving Newtonfree crack cocaine too many times before.After his death, Newton was floated alongon a pond of crocodile tears by many whomhe had disappointed and abused. Attemptingto glorify themselves and the years they hadwasted in the party, they were quite willingto overlook the considerable blemishes of theman who had come to call himself ""the SupremeServant of the People.""Flores A. Forbes's memoir of his experiencesin the Black Panther Party, ""Will YouDie With Me?,"" may startle those who wouldromanticize this homemade Maoist organizationin the same way that T. J. Stiles's biographyof Jesse James startled readers whenit proved that James was not at all a RobinHood. In ""Jesse James: Last Rebel of the CivilWar,"" Stiles showed that James was a racistand terrorist always willing to manipulateothers through their resentment at losing theCivil War, and through the hatred they felt whenforced to see black people move beyond the positionof plantation chattel. Newton apparentlyhad the same ability to manipulate his followers— through their understandable hostility towardracism, and through their unfortunately romanticfantasies about being revolutionaries in thevanguard of social change so thorough it wouldbring down the United States government.Forbes joined the Black Panthers at theend of the 1960's and worked his way up until hefunctioned as a bodyguard, an enforcer and agunman in the inner circle of the party. As theonetime head of the Panthers' ""military arm,""he has eyewitness things to tell us that havenever been made so clear before. In a very low-key,matter-of-fact style that takes attemptedmurder, gunplay, beatings, extortion and arrestsas normal occurrences, Forbes pulls the coversoff Newton with so much authority that the casehis book makes against the Black Panther legendwill be hard to dismiss. In unparalleled detail, we are given the inside story of a left-winggroup of ""revolutionaries"" whose organizationevolved into a lucrative criminal enterprise— the first step of a grand design in which thepolitical structure of Oakland would be takenover.

"'06-09-10,'0','What Michigan lawmakers put together was a plan — approved by nearly three-quarters of the voters in a statewide referendum in 1994 — that called for money generated by the state’s sales tax to pay for public education. It also capped the level of yearly property tax increases at 5 percent.As a result, the average annual property tax bill in Michigan is about $2,000 less today than it would be without the change.“I think that New Jersey now is exactly like Michigan back then — taxes were the lightning rod,” said Don Gilmer, a former Republican state representative who helped draft the proposal.Some elements resembling parts of Michigan’s solution have already been suggested in Trenton. For instance, at the start of the special legislative session, Gov. Jon S. Corzine proposed a cap of 4 percent on the annual increase in property tax rates. In many towns, the rate has climbed nearly twice that in one year.And while legislators have also discussed reducing the state’s reliance on property taxes to pay for public schools — last year, $10.8 billion, or 55 percent, of the state’s $19.6 billion property tax levy was used for education — no legislator has at this point suggested a change as drastic as the one in Michigan.Perhaps the most audacious idea so far, which got a lukewarm response from lawmakers, came from a Democratic assemblyman in Hudson County, Louis M. Manzo, who proposed cutting property tax bills by an average of $1,250 by paying for some school costs with an income tax surcharge.But Michigan legislators who were involved in drafting the proposed changes say that states like New Jersey seeking to lower their property tax rates might find a significant source of untapped potential revenue in the sales tax.Mr. Gilmer, the former Michigan legislator, offered this suggestion to his counterparts in Trenton: “Don’t set the expectation that this” — using sales taxes instead of property taxes to pay for schools — “is the perfect plan. We came up with something that’s served us well.”And Michigan’s solution has not been trouble-free. Because the state’s schools rely on sales taxes, which vary according to factors like the unemployment rate and consumer spending, the amount of money raised is less stable than it was when property taxes were the primary source of financing.Indeed, since Michigan adopted the change, the state has routinely filled shortfalls in school financing through sales tax revenue with one-shot payments from the state’s general fund that have recurred, and have amounted to roughly a half-billion dollars annually.Critics also ask whether the system can adequately serve Michigan’s urban districts that typically have a higher proportion of students in more costly special education programs.Moreover, the political climate in New Jersey, its already relatively high sales tax and per-pupil spending levels could make Michigan’s solution an unlikely option in Trenton.A significant part of Michigan’s plan was a 2 percentage-point increase in the sales tax, to 6 percent from 4 percent. Although Mr. Corzine has asked legislators to think creatively on the property tax question, he almost certainly does not want to take the politically risky step of putting forth another request to raise the sales tax after the problems that led to a shutdown in July.Members of the Legislature might also be unwilling to support another tax increase before elections in November 2007.Asked about Governor Corzine’s opinion of Michigan’s plan, his press secretary, Anthony Coley, said, “We encourage the Legislature to examine ways to make sure all of New Jersey’s children, regardless of ZIP code, receive the education they need and deserve.”Even if the governor and the Legislature had the will to raise the sales tax, there may be little practical benefit in doing so. Some say that the sales tax cannot go much higher without having potentially harmful effects, like encouraging businesses to leave the state and shoppers to spend less or shop elsewhere.“The first problem you have is that our sales tax in New Jersey is already 7 percent, and you don’t have the kind of room you need to get the money,” said State Senator Gerald S. Cardinale, a Republican who represents Bergen County and is a leading voice in the Legislature on fiscal policy matters. “A tax shift is a very, very difficult thing.”Mr. Cardinale, who says that the Michigan plan is unworkable in New Jersey, said that another factor is the disparity in per-student spending. In 2003, New Jersey had the nation’s fourth-highest spending rate at $11,103; Michigan, which spends $8,315 per student, was 14th.If spending in of each of New Jersey’s school districts were added up, the total would exceed $20 billion. Property taxes cover about half that amount, $10.8 billion. But the sales tax generates only about $8 billion, leaving the state with a deficit right out of the gate.“It’s a heavy lift to fund schools from nonproperty tax sources,” said Henry A. Coleman, a professor of public policy at Rutgers University. “I don’t think that eliminating the property tax from primary and secondary education is doable, or desirable, in New Jersey.”One reason for that is how the state relies — critics say over-relies — on those taxes, which municipalities use to cover local services like schools and fire and police departments. Although the state is responsible for education, local governments collect property taxes. New Jersey counts on those taxes for about 45 percent of its total tax revenue; nationally, the number is closer to 30 percent.Still, Mr. Coleman said that Michigan’s experience should motivate New Jersey legislators to be creative in finding ways to cut property taxes.Lawmakers have been charged by Mr. Corzine to come up with ways to reduce property taxes by the end of the year. Four legislative committees — examining school financing, government consolidation, public workers’ benefits and possible changes to the state’s Constitution — have been holding rare, summer hearings weekly in Trenton.Those meetings are scheduled to continue until October, when the Legislature hopes to draft bills that can begin to reduce the state’s tax burden. According to some estimates, New Jersey must reduce the total it collects through property taxes by about $4 billion a year to begin to provide real relief for state residents.Mr. Coleman said that the Legislature can generate money by taking steps like expanding the scope of the sales tax to cover things like legal fees, bail bonds and air charter services — all proposals that were discussed and defeated during the most recent round of budget talks.Other potential money-raisers — although almost certainly unpopular ones — include raising the income tax in some brackets and increasing the state’s reliance on fees and surcharges, like raising the price of lottery tickets.“The only limit is our imagination,” Mr. Coleman said. “We need to look a bit more intently at what they’re doing in other states. Michigan took a radical step. While I wouldn’t necessarily advocate that step for New Jersey, there may be a reasonable balance.”Some of the legislators involved in drafting Michigan’s changes said that they sought that same kind of balance, although it did not necessarily begin in an ideal way.In the summer of 1993, the Legislature — locked in a bitter debate over school financing — voted to eliminate property taxes as the source of money for education without having another system in place.Observers say the move was a bit of political gamesmanship by a Legislature featuring an equally divided House and intended to undermine Gov. John M. Engler, a Republican, who had campaigned on a promise of lowering property taxes.After initially resisting the move, Mr. Engler encouraged Republicans, who held a 22-16 edge in the Senate, to support the plan. “What started out as a political gimmick we saw as a chance at reform,” Mr. Engler said. “We knew that only once were we going to have a shot at this.”While legislators were wrestling with the problem, Michigan residents like Mr. Wilson were girding for a tax revolt. Mr. Wilson joined a group known as the Kalamazoo Taxpayers Association, a group seeking what it called fairness in tax policy.But before the revolt could take hold, legislators drafted the legislation to change the financing and put it on the ballot in March 1994. The Legislature had built in a provision that would have raised the income tax and lowered property taxes by a more modest rate if voters had rejected the measure.“From the point of view of tax policy, it solved a problem that, as in New Jersey, was longstanding for taxpayers and delivered as promised,” said David N. Plank, a professor of education at Michigan State University.But could what works for Michigan be the answer for New Jersey?“There’s no right answer because of the nature of the situation,” Mr. Coleman said. “You know the old saying, ‘Don’t let the perfect be the enemy of the good.’ We can improve the situation even if we can’t make it perfect.”'"
"'06-09-10,'0','Ibrahim al-Jaafari, the former prime minister and head of Dawa, visited Iran while he was in office. The head of the main Shiite bloc in Parliament, Abdul Aziz al-Hakim, is considered extremely close to Iran’s top leaders. His party was founded in Iran and its armed wing, the Badr Brigade, fought against Iraq in the eight-year Iran-Iraq war in the 1980’s.On Friday, an Interior Ministry official said Iranian troops had arrested five members of the Iraqi security forces and their interpreter last week while the Iraqis were patrolling the Iraq-Iran border northeast of Baghdad. The official Iranian news agency said seven Iraqis had been captured.The American ambassador, Zalmay Khalilzad, and American commanders strongly condemned Iranian interference in Iraq last month, saying they had evidence that individuals or groups in Iran were training and supporting Shiite militias here. Mr. Khalilzad said Iranians were urging militia groups to step up attacks against the Americans.The United States has been pressing Iran over its nuclear program as well. The Bush administration is urging the United Nations Security Council to pass a resolution that would impose economic and political sanctions on Iran if Iran persists in its uranium enrichment program, which the Americans say is intended for the manufacture of nuclear weapons.But it would be difficult for the White House to persuade Iraq to take a strong stand against Iran. Besides the political ties among Shiite politicians, the border is very porous, and Shiite pilgrims from Iran often come to Iraq to mingle freely in the religious cities here. Iranians helped make up the hundreds of thousands of Shiites, possibly millions, who gathered in the city of Karbala on Saturday to celebrate the birthday of a vanished Shiite imam known as the Mahdi.Three pilgrims en route to Karbala were killed in the town of Musayyib by a mortar round, an Interior Ministry official said.In Baghdad, gunmen killed a secretary for a government-financed newspaper, Al Sabah, in a drive-by shooting. A minibus driver was killed when his vehicle exploded. A bomb in a parked car killed a policeman and wounded six others, and another bomb exploding near an American convoy killed one civilian and wounded at least six.A homemade bomb that was detonated near a bakery in Kirkuk killed three civilians, two of them children, and wounded eight others, all women and children, police officials said. Another bomb in the city killed a policeman and wounded two others.'"
"'06-09-10,'0','Employee branding became part of the lexicon during the dot-com boom, when employers realized they needed a strong brand to attract the best talent from a very large pool. It is now becoming even more of a force as human resource professionals face a shrinking pool of applicants.“The number of workers entering the work force is becoming less and less every year,” said D. Mark Hornung, a senior vice president in charge of the employer brand practice at the Bernard Hodes Group, a consulting firm in New York. “In 2007, for every worker entering the work force, there will be three leaving. The number of people with the necessary math and reading skills is also declining.”Hodes helps market companies — Wheaton is one of its clients — as desirable employers. In June, its international arm released an extensive employer branding survey.If there are fewer suitable candidates for employment, companies will be forced to try much harder to get appropriate job seekers to sign on. “Before the dot-com era, the sense was, ‘I’m the employer, queue up in line, maybe I’ll hire you and maybe I won’t,’ ” Mr. Hornung said. “The power is now increasingly in the hands of the worker.”Hiring officials do have some leverage, however. “You use your brand as an attractor and an argument to help them come to you, instead of the competition,” he said. “Human resources people today are marketing and salespeople.”Of course, this tactic works best when a company has a strong brand to sell.Mr. Hornung cites Google as an example of such a brand. Companies that use their brand right, he said, will have the most applicants, thereby creating what the industry calls a pipeline — many people who know that their way of life aligns with your brand. “You get the pick of the crop,” Mr. Hornung said.Employer branding does have its vulnerable spots, however.F. Leigh Branham, a specialist on employee retention and the owner of a business consultancy, Keeping the People Inc., in Overland Park, Kan., suggests that the strategy can fall flat on its face when managers, many of whom “don’t get what’s going on in the labor force,” are not informed or are not part of the branding process, which is a fairly typical occurrence. Mr. Branham, who is the author of “The Seven Hidden Reasons Employees Leave” (Amacom, 2005), also says he believes that some companies are taking shortcuts.Instead of determining what is special about its culture and organization — the main reasons people would want to work there — these companies have put together ads, brochures and Web site content presenting a less than truthful image but one that people will be attracted to, he said. “There are several cases where companies have done this, and then hired hordes of young people who then realized the culture was not as advertised.”If the company falls short of what it promised as a brand, he said, it has set itself up for high turnover over a very short period of time.Why would companies risk misrepresenting their brand? “Their thought process is, If we brand ourselves this way, it will give our managers something to live up to, meaning, This is the kind of employer we want to be,” Mr. Branham said. What fuels this behavior, he said, is the notion of “if we announce to the world that we are that, we will work toward it and become that.”He said he believed that having employees leave after finding out the branding had been falsified could hurt a company more than having a weak brand.Companies trying to create a hiring program tied to employer branding might well learn from observing those companies that have already built and are protecting a strong brand. Barbara Kavovit, who owns Barbara K Enterprises, a New York company that makes ergonomically designed tools for women, uses, on the company’s Web site and products, the tag line “You can do it with Barbara K!”“That tells a story,” said Ms. Kavovit, who has 10 employees. “They wouldn’t come on board unless they were an independent woman or wanted to be one.”The message, she said, was one of attraction. “I am living it and I want everyone who walks into our office to get that feeling,” she said. Consistency is important.Jeanne Palmer, founder and president of the Palmer Advantage, in San Jose, Calif., which consults with companies on human resources practices, said: “Whatever environment you have, everything needs to reflect that — Web content, ads, even the people you put into your booths at job fairs. Companies have to mirror and reinforce their brands constantly.”And there’s a payoff, when a business’s brand meets the expectations of its employees.“The most effective employment branding is word of mouth — what people say at parties, on weekends — when they get asked, How do you like working there?” Mr. Branham said. “That spreads like crazy.”'"
"'06-09-10,'0','Since 2004, Ms. Knight and Ms. Coram have continued their struggles with depression, their fates intersecting with Cyberonics’ own battles with the F.D.A. and insurers, as well as medical skeptics and public interest groups who argue that the company is peddling false hopes built on a still unproved technology.The struggle over the future of the $15,000 device, which costs another $10,000 or more to implant, is being played out against that most tender of landscapes: the human psyche and the unpredictable and poorly mapped fault lines that cause depression and separate people from themselves and the world around them.IT is a very promising avenue of research, and the long-term data they are pushing are encouraging,” said Dr. Christopher Gorton, chief medical officer of APS Healthcare, a consulting firm that was hired by the state of South Carolina to review Cyberonics’ research results. “But people have a legitimate need to be cautious. Even the sponsors admit they don’t know exactly how it works. The psychiatric literature is full of people clutching at straws.”Some 21 million American adults suffer from depression, according to the National Institute of Mental Health, a federal research agency. While doctors as far back as the Renaissance speculated that mood disorders had medical roots, it was not until the end of the 19th century that such views were widely accepted. Since then, mental health care has seen innovations in talk therapy, electroshock, surgical procedures, drugs and, most recently, implanted devices.Along the way, there have been notorious examples of misplaced medical enthusiasm, including adoption of lobotomies to treat depression. Currently, critics complain about frequent misuse of electroshock therapy and the virtually unregulated mixing of potent antidepression and antipsychotic drugs.Cyberonics, which finally secured F.D.A. approval to market its implant last year, has ventured into the most difficult corner of depression treatment. It says its stimulator can provide relief for many of the four million or so people who suffer from “treatment resistant depression,” or T.R.D., a form so severe that patients fail to respond to drugs and traditional shock therapy. No other product has ever been designed for — and tested exclusively on — such a severely depressed population.During the last month, some 1,300 doctors, patients and Cyberonics employees have written to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, asking that the agency grant Cyberonics’ recent petition for Medicare coverage. Public Citizen, a consumer advocacy group in Washington, filed a competing request on Wednesday, asking the agency to deny coverage. The group contends that Cyberonics has relied on misleading advertising and clinical trial write-ups, among other tactics, to secure federal approvals.“With substantial constraints on the Medicare budget and so many clear needs going unmet, it seems absurd to flush away millions of dollars on this unproven device,” wrote Dr. Peter Lurie, deputy director of health research for Public Citizen, in the group’s petition. Other problems loom over the company. Federal prosecutors and regulators are investigating its pay practices, according to recent securities filings. Earnings disappointments over the last year have also caused Cyberonics’ stock to drop to $17.30 from a 52-week high of $40.69. Mr. Cummins declined to comment on the investigations, which are continuing.But in an e-mail message last week, he scornfully dismissed Public Citizen’s criticisms as “shrill” and questioned Dr. Lurie’s expertise. “I look forward to the day when T.R.D. patients and fully qualified psychiatrists have the right to make treatment decisions regarding the ONLY treatment ever studied, proven safe and effective and F.D.A. approved for the long-term treatment of T.R.D!” he wrote.The Cyberonics implant, like so many modern medical devices born of recent technological advances, would have been unimaginable only a generation ago. After being implanted in a patient’s chest, the device is surgically wired to the neck’s left vagus nerve, a major pathway for nerve signals to the brain from the heart and torso. Research suggests that repeated electronic stimulation of the vagus nerve can help treat severe depression by altering chemical and electrical functions in areas of the brain linked to mood disorders.Cyberonics, which was founded in 1987, initially developed the stimulator to help epileptics control seizures. The F.D.A. approved that use in 1997. In 1998, based on animal tests and reports that many epileptics with the implant experienced mood improvements, Mr. Cummins gambled Cyberonics’ future on the idea that the device could also help treat patients with T.R.D. — people like Ms. Knight and Ms. Coram.Mr. Cummins forecast, to Wall Street’s delight, that the T.R.D. market might be 10 times bigger than the epilepsy market. But his zeal also reflected his own family’s experience with depression, an affliction he says drove his mother and his grandfather to suicide. “My mother was my object lesson in wasted potential,” he said.A squarely built, 6-foot-2-inch former college linebacker, Mr. Cummins, 52, says his mantra is, “Maybe wrong but never in doubt.” His shaved head and nonstop intensity seem well suited to someone whose idea of relaxation is competing in Nascar-affiliated car racing events. He now owns a Daytona Prototype race car — named Cyberspeed in honor of his company.A native of Grove City, Pa., Mr. Cummins is the youngest of three children born into a dysfunctional family that he said was ripped apart by the periodic absences of his father, a steelworker, and his mother’s depression, alcohol and drug addictions. A decent student and a star athlete, he won a scholarship to Dartmouth, where he majored in government affairs.After earning an M.B.A. at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign Mr. Cummins eventually became a venture capitalist, joining Cyberonics’ board in 1988. Cyberonics was the brainchild of Reese S. Terry Jr., a veteran of the medical device industry, who set up the company to develop nerve-stimulation technology invented by Dr. Jacob Zabara at Temple University.Dr. Zabara was one of many researchers exploring how electrical stimulation of the nervous system and the brain could affect a range of mental and physical ailments. The neurostimulation market as a whole now generates $1 billion annually in revenue, according to Wall Street analysts, and includes devices like spinal-cord stimulators that mask pain and deep brain implants that control some symptoms of Parkinson’s disease.Wall Street and leading device companies see neurostimulation growing into a $10 billion business in the next decade, thanks to rapid advances in microchips and sensors. Executives at Cyberonics say that focusing on the vagus nerve makes its implants as effective but less risky and invasive than those that stimulate the brain and spinal cord.Mr. Cummins became Cyberonics’ chief executive in 1995, when the company was struggling to stay afloat financially while seeking regulatory approval of its epilepsy therapy. He took over about the same time that Tamara Knight began a seemingly irreversible slide into severe depression.Ms. Knight began suffering from depression as a teenager, a struggle that led to an early suicide attempt. Several years ago, drugs that had helped her recover stopped working. She began to neglect housework and her three children. In the fall of 1998, after several incidents in which she became outraged with co-workers, she lost her job. That winter, she began electroshock therapy.What followed, she said, were more than 30 such treatments and more hospitalizations than she can recall. The number of drugs she took kept increasing, along with her weight. At one point, Ms. Knight, who is 5-foot-6 and had struggled with anorexia as a teenager, weighed more than 200 pounds. By 2004, she was depressed and was suffering from a common side effect of the electroshock therapy required to control her suicidal impulses: a steady erosion of her memory.“Moneywise, insurance and Medicare paid for them,” Ms. Knight said of her treatments. “But it cost 30 years of my life in memory loss.”As often happens in cases of severe depression, the family says it also lost the support of outsiders, including its local church. “If Tamara had had cancer, our church would have had people visiting all the time,” Mr. Knight said. “One older man visited us as long as he was able. That was it. It was a real blow to our faith.”When Ms. Knight’s psychiatrist recommended a Cyberonics implant shortly after the F.D.A. approved the device in 2005, she became enthusiastic. Mr. Knight, who said he thought that V.N.S. therapy — Cyberonics’ trademarked name for “vagus nerve stimulation” — sounded far-fetched when he heard about it a few years earlier, now agreed that it was a chance they had to take.HE was worried, though, that public information about V.N.S. came largely from Cyberonics and highlighted favorable aspects of clinical data. Negative experiences of clinical-study patients like Katherine Coram were not readily available, outside of commentaries that epilepsy patients posted on a Cyberonics Web site.Ms. Coram recalls feeling better in the first six months after her Cyberonics stimulator first turned on in 2001.But when researchers ramped up her implant’s power to enhance its long-term performance, Ms. Coram began suffering nausea, sleeplessness and panic attacks that sent her to the hospital. She lost track of her finances. Like many victims of severe depression, she also began to experience distressingly peculiar setbacks, including an inability to load her dishwasher. Ms. Coram said doctors raised and lowered the implant’s power level several times before she asked them to turn it off temporarily.“I was trusting the people in the study to figure out how to use the device but they didn’t have a clue,” Ms. Coram said.The experiences of individuals like Ms. Coram and inconclusive data were not enough, though, for the F.D.A. to shut its doors to Cyberonics. In June 2004, an advisory panel recommended that the agency allow Cyberonics to market its stimulator.That same night, Cyberonics’ board granted Mr. Cummins a bonus of 150,000 stock options. The next day, as the stock market reacted to the F.D.A. panel’s recommendation, Cyberonics shares leapt 77 percent, laying the groundwork for what, two years later, would become inquiries by the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Justice Department into whether Mr. Cummins’s options grant was legal.But in 2004, Mr. Cummins had more immediate problems. By early August, critics inside and outside the F.D.A. had talked the agency into the unusual step of disagreeing with its advisory panel. True, there were success stories from patients who achieved almost complete recoveries (nearly 20 percent, according to Cyberonics). Data also suggested that patients who benefited — over 50 percent to one degree or another — were more likely to avoid relapses, expensive hospitalizations and suicide than a similar group of patients who received conventional therapy.Still, in the most carefully controlled trial, a group that had the device implanted but not turned on fared nearly as well as the group being stimulated. Critics also pointed out that long-term results indicated that 30 percent of the patients reported worsening depression similar to Ms. Coram’s, creating unanswered questions about potential harm.Mr. Cummins said in a press release that Cyberonics was “shocked” by the agency’s rejection. He denigrated the F.D.A. request for more randomized testing, arguing that other antidepression therapies had been subjected to far less challenging scrutiny. And he suggested to analysts that the agency’s decision would leave many patients feeling that they had no option other than suicide. In September, the F.D.A. accepted an amended application from Cyberonics that contained more long-term performance data and comparisons to other therapies.Still, it came as something of a surprise on Wall Street and in the medical device industry when the F.D.A. decided early in February 2005 to approve V.N.S. as a depression treatment if Cyberonics met certain conditions. Most of the new requirements dealt with follow-up studies aimed at figuring out how the device could be used most effectively. Mr. Cummins forecast that all of the conditions could be met by the end of May. Shares of Cyberonics soared, and the company went on a hiring spree.Mr. Cummins cast the decision as a victory for patients but also heralded the financial upside, projecting that Cyberonics’ sales could reach $1 billion by 2010. In the weeks after the F.D.A.’s announcement, he responded to Cyberonics’ stock run-up by exercising options on 350,000 shares, which netted him about $10.75 million. (The sales left him holding just over 36,000 Cyberonics shares, a stake he has since raised to 173,750 shares, according to federal filings.)The long-awaited marketing approval from the F.D.A. came in July, but new problems emerged. A prominent board member resigned, citing disagreements with other directors over compensation policies and lack of a succession plan for Mr. Cummins.The Senate Finance Committee, which began investigating the F.D.A.’s handling of the implant that spring, issued a staffreport in February of this year criticizing Dr. Daniel G. Schultz, a senior F.D.A. official, for overruling agency experts opposed to the device. An F.D.A. spokeswoman said that the agency acted carefully and that for “the small number of patients with severe depression who have failed all other treatments, data shows this may be the difference between being able to live a more productive life or suffer from debilitating illness.”The Senate report also put Medicare officials on notice that decisions to cover V.N.S. would invite further scrutiny.Continued uncertainty surrounding V.N.S. and Mr. Cummins’s us-against-the-world attitude have taken their toll on Cyberonics’ stock price and on Wall Street’s faith in the company. “There are institutional investors who won’t touch the company as long as Skip is at the helm,” said Jan Wald, an analyst at A. G. Edwards & Sons.To hear Mr. Cummins tell it, what really matters is that a growing number of depression patients now credit the device with saving their lives. They include Ms. Knight, who got her Cyberonics implant last October, and quickly proved to be the kind of patient the company treasures.“My family could see subtle differences right away,” Ms. Knight recalled in the letter of support for V.N.S. she sent to Medicare regulators last month. “I was out of bed more often and started taking an interest in how the house looked.”While Ms. Knight, now 47, talks about “having my life back,” the legacy of severe depression remains with her. After spending so much time for so many years in bed, her body cannot keep up with all the things she now wants to do around the house, often leaving her in pain. She continues to lose her way around her hometown and mourns the loss of so much of her long-term memory. But she has been able to cut back to using just three medications, a change she credits with helping her shed 40 pounds.MS. CORAM is also on the mend, but not because of V.N.S. or Cyberonics. After enduring numerous futile adjustments to her implant and having it temporarily turned off, she asked her doctors to try one last time in March 2004. Three months later, she stopped using the implant for good and then had it removed from her chest. Her doctors left the metal leads wrapped around her vagus nerve, saying it was too risky to try to remove them.She said she is slowly regaining the ability to do household tasks — like paying bills — that had been impossible during her V.N.S. treatment. “I feel like I’m just beginning to get my life back,” she said recently.Mr. Cummins remains as driven as ever. Cyberonics says 1,810 patients have received the implants since the product was approved, out of 13,313 identified candidates. Thousands have been caught up in lengthy and often unsuccessful appeals for insurance coverage, since only a few small insurers routinely pay for the device.Seeking the traction it desperately needs with insurers, Cyberonics decided in May to narrow the company’s focus to the subset of T.R.D. patients whose problems are the most costly for health care providers. Cyberonics contends that V.N.S. treatment for that group would save hospitals $4,800 to $8,200 a patient annually, based on an estimate of the implant’s cost and follow-up visits over eight years. But Cyberonics’ calculation is based on optimistic presumptions, including aggressive estimates about the pace and nature of patients’ recovery.Because the presumptions are also based primarily on results from earlier trials, critics like Public Citizen say the new focus has all the flaws of the old one.However the controversy is resolved, depression victims who finally get an implant will find themselves entering a medical lottery. Many, like Joe Marhefka, 49, of Colchester, Conn., are too depressed to be optimistic about the procedure.Mr. Marhefka, who ended up in the hospital last fall after attempting suicide, said that he masked his depression most of his life by drinking. When he gave up alcohol eight years ago, the depression seemed to intensify. He said electroshock therapy two years ago destroyed most of his memories of his adolescence, and younger adult years. He lost his job as a high school math teacher shortly before his suicide attempt.“When I had the implant last month, I was hoping I wouldn’t wake up,” Mr. Marhefka said in July, before entering the New London, Conn., office of Dr. Kathleen R. Degen to have his stimulator activated. “I don’t have any hopes this is going to work. I’m doing this because my wife deserves a husband and my two daughters deserve a Dad. They have hope. I’m just going along with the doctors.”Dr. Degen used a hand-held computer to program a wand that Mr. Marhefka held over the spot on his chest where his implant was located. A 30-second-long pulse surged into his vagus nerve, reducing Mr. Marhefka’s voice to a barely audible rasp. When the pulse stopped, his voice returned to normal and he conversed briefly with Dr. Degen. He asked about reducing his medications; Dr. Degen said the request was common, but that it was too early to consider it.Five minutes later, just as Mr. Marhefka asked whether his implant was still on, it delivered its second pulse — again taking away his voice and leaving him with what he said was a mild strangling feeling. Dr. Degen let the pulse pass and explained how she would gauge his future progress.But Mr. Marhefka plans to measure his progress with his own yardstick.“If I start smiling again, maybe even laughing sometimes, that’s how I’ll know,” he had said just before entering Dr. Degen’s office. So far, Mr. Marhefka said in a phone call last week, he is still waiting.'"

You’re listed on three stock exchanges, including the New York Stock Exchange. Haven’t the reporting requirements complicated your life?A. I think it has complicated everyone’s life. The amount of bureaucracy that has come along with that has been applied in a very undifferentiated way to companies large and small. That has certainly added an additional cost.We know there are always black sheep. The question is, Do you want to establish a principle in which you say, “We assume from the start that everyone is a black sheep and therefore everyone has to be treated like a black sheep”? Or do you want a system where you can go very heavily after the black sheep but also have a climate in which 90 or 95 percent of companies that are behaving can develop themselves and are not overburdened by bureaucracy?Q. When you sit in Munich thinking about where you will invest, does this climate affect your opinion about whether you should invest in the United States or, say, China?A. We are a long-term investor. It is not like we are heavily influenced by short-term hiccups.The fundamentals for the United States are very strong.

Can you envision that it would ever affect your investment decisions?A. Yes. It absolutely plays a role in decisions, but not if it’s a short-term thing, almost like a fashion.Q. In the German governance model, you have a management board and then a supervisory board. You are in charge of the management board, but you report to the supervisory board. How does that work?A. This is one of the debates that you’ve been having after Enron and WorldCom. There’s been research. The data I’ve seen is that you cannot boil it down to the structure. You have to basically go to the individuals who are involved. If the individuals can work very well together, if the chemistry is right, if there’s a good operational mode, it can be done in a very positive way. I would not overplay the structure. Bear in mind, Enron had split the role of chairman and C.E.O., which at that time was the exception.Q. What are your observations from a European perspective about the fluidity here among C.E.O.’s, boards and shareholders?A. It boils down to having a great management team that can act fast, because today’s world market is a fast, competitive environment. My mantra has always been: nobody’s perfect, but a team can be.Q. Is there a risk that if American C.E.O.’s are engaged in hostile relationships with boards or shareholders, they may not be able to respond quickly enough?A. My impression is that if American C.E.O.’s don’t have good relations with their boards, they aren’t going to last. In today’s world, the alignment between the board and the C.E.O. is absolutely crucial, independent of exactly how it’s structured. One fundamental issue for people on boards today is to be able to judge what is truly in the interest of the shareholder.Some shareholders are getting very verbal and frankly don’t have a track record to support their claims, so it’s more crucial than ever for directors to understand what they are responsible for when it comes to value for the shareholder.

With little help from the high ratio of a transmission’s top gear, an engine’s low-speed pulling power is not enough to heave the vehicle smoothly into motion and then accelerate it strongly.A low ratio, like 4 to 1, makes it easier to move away from a stop because of the mechanical advantage provided by gear reduction. The principle is similar to using a longer lever to move a heavy object. (To confuse matters, lower ratios are numerically higher; 3 to 1 is a lower ratio than 2 to 1).If the start-off gear were the only ratio in the transmission, it would limit the car’s top speed to perhaps 50 miles an hour — with the engine screaming. At least two gears are needed, one for starting and one for highway cruising.Why add an intermediate gear? Try starting in first gear, then shifting to the top gear. You will start out smoothly, with initially strong acceleration, but when you shift, the car’s acceleration drops to almost nothing. The wide gap between the ratios has pulled the engine’s r.p.m. below its range of useful torque output. This, then, is why the transmissions of so many American V-8 automobiles of the past had three forward speeds.But if you downsize that big V-8 engine — a necessity given 21st-century fuel prices — everything changes. To obtain acceptable power from a smaller engine, it must be tuned to a finer edge, sharply narrowing the range of engine speeds over which it delivers strong torque. With only three speeds, the ratio gap at each upshift would pull the engine r.p.m. out of this range, making acceleration anemic.To keep the engine revs always within the torque range, four speeds, or even five, are needed. That is why modern smaller-displacement engines are usually paired with four- or five-speed transmissions.The coming of federal fuel economy standards made the quest for higher mileage permanent. This had the effect of requiring a high top-gear ratio so a car could maintain highway speeds at the lowest possible engine r.p.m. This defines approximately what a transmission’s top-gear ratio has to be.The heavier the vehicle, the lower the first gear must be to give the engine the leverage it needs to accelerate briskly. Racing cars, being light, have tall first gears, but heavy luxury sedans need a low first.How do engineers fill in the space between the first and top gears? They start by looking at the best pulling range of the engine. What is the r.p.m. difference between peak power and peak torque? If the shift from first to second pulls engine r.p.m. down too far below peak torque, acceleration in second gear will suffer. That pretty much defines the ratio splits between first and second, and between the other lower gears.As the car gets moving at higher speeds, horsepower becomes more important than torque because it is power that must overcome aerodynamic drag and rolling friction. The engineers have to make sure that at the upshift, engine revs do not drop so far that the power to continue accelerating becomes unavailable. This forces ratios to be more closely spaced toward top gear.A final consideration is that the wider the ratio separation, the more perceptible is the “thump” of each upshift. The shock is created by the energy of the spinning internal parts as the rotating speed is suddenly pulled down in the next-higher gear. Programming of the timing and force of shifts in modern electronically controlled automatic transmissions is very sophisticated, but there are limits.Now that the car is at highway speed, why not just stay in top gear? Thirty years ago, the torque converter on every automatic transmission allowed the engine to freely speed up and make more power as the driver opened the throttle slightly to meet an upgrade.Today, fuel economy requirements have made it necessary to add a small clutch inside the torque converter to eliminate slippage at highway speeds.As we approach a hill today, the car is in a very tall economy gear, with the engine revs low. Just opening the throttle won’t get the car over the hill, because the engine needs to spin faster to make the necessary power. That requires a downshift. Hills come in a variety of grades, so the car may need more than two closely spaced upper ratios to keep the engine working efficiently, on hill and dale. In fact, all four top ratios in the Lexus eight-speed are separated by less than 20 percent drops in engine revs. This allows efficient cruising with almost imperceptible shifts.Therefore, it was the constraints of a low first gear, a very high top gear and manageable ratio splits in between that resulted in Lexus’s choice of eight forward speeds.This surprises people accustomed to the gear ratios used in racing, but the world of heavy luxury sedans is more akin to heavy trucks than to high-performance sports cars. Lots of big trucks have eight-speed gearboxes for the same reasons — they need a low first to accelerate their weight, then progressively closer ratios in the higher gears.You can get a rough idea of the design intentions behind a gearbox by dividing its top ratio into its first-gear ratio. This number — the overall ratio spread — generally lies between 1.9 and 2.5 for racing cars. To keep a racing engine within its typically narrow useful rev range, transmission ratios must be closely spaced, and first gear can be quite tall because the vehicle’s weight is low.For the Lexus LS 460, the ratio spread is much larger, from 4.60 in first to 0.68 to 1 in eighth, which works out to 6.7. This suggests that first gear is very low for brisk starting of the car’s considerable mass, while the top gear is very high for fuel-efficient cruising. At the engine’s peak revs, 6,400 r.p.m., this car could easily reach its governed top speed of 130 miles an hour in fifth gear.Then why eight speeds? Maximum r.p.m. at freeway cruising speed would be inefficient — and uncivilized to boot. The three higher gears are there to enable smooth gear changing while holding engine r.p.m. at unobtrusive and fuel-saving low levels.Automakers have begun using transmissions with an unlimited number of ratios — the continuously variable transmission — to do even better. While the concept is valid, limitations of the mechanical parts, especially when paired with large engines, have so far kept this design from universal use.'"

"'06-09-10,'0','TRANSMISSIONS, and the people who shifted them, once followed a simple formula: manual or automatic. But now the lines are fuzzy; the newest designs defy classification and confuse customers. Here are some common transmissions today.MANUAL In the most basic design, the driver shifts gears by moving a lever — engagement is entirely mechanical. The engine and transmission are linked by the clutch, a friction device usually operated by a floor pedal.AUTOMATIC Just put it in Drive and go — shifting is done for the driver by multiplate clutches, engaged and released by hydraulic pressure, that activate compact planetary gear sets. The engine and transmission are connected by a fluid coupling called a torque converter.MANUAL-CONTROL AUTOMATIC Sometimes called “manumatics,” these automatics add electronic controls that let the driver manually select ratios using a lever on the center console or paddles on the steering wheel. Porsche’s Tiptronic was one of the first of these enhanced controls, but many sports and luxury cars now offer them.CONTINUOUSLY VARIABLE The C.V.T. in a vehicle like a Nissan Murano offers an infinite number of ratios — it is stepless, without fixed gears — using variable-diameter pulleys and a steel belt. Operation is automatic.SEQUENTIAL TRANSMISSION Developed from racecars, these are mechanically similar to manual gearboxes but are shifted electronically. Typically they offer a programmed mode for automated operation; while there is a clutch, the floor pedal is replaced by a hidden electronic actuator. Ratios can be changed up or down one gear at a time, in sequence. Audi, BMW, Ferrari, Maserati and Volkswagen offer these gearboxes on many models.'"
"'06-09-10,'0','This summer, the Versa landed as a four-door hatchback, filling a spot vacated when the Nissan Sentra moved up in size and price. A Versa sedan is due to go on sale early next year.Like the Fit and the Yaris, the Versa aims to be diminutive without being punitive. It comes in two trim levels, the S and SL, with the least expensive model starting at $13,165 (all prices include the $615 destination charge).I tested a preproduction version of the 1.8 SL, the top-of-the-line model, which started at $16,165 with a continuously variable transmission. My test car came to $17,415 with the convenience package ($700), audio package ($300) and antilock brakes ($250). On all of these small vehicles, options can quickly raise the sticker price.This is the first Nissan in America to be built on architecture jointly developed with Renault, which controls Nissan, and the Versa’s styling has strong hints of Renault as well. The Versa shares its mechanical platform with the Renault Modus and Clio; the Japanese-market Nissan Cube also uses this subcompact B-class foundation. The Versa is known as the Tiida in most of the world.While the Versa is configured much like the Fit, which also rides on a B-class platform, the Versa is almost a foot longer. The added length is especially notable in the back seat, where the Versa has 38 inches of legroom, beating the Fit by more than 4 inches.A new compact rear suspension pushes parts off to the side, a design that provides a generous 17.8 cubic feet of cargo space behind the rear seats. Still, the Fit does better, with 21.3 cubic feet, even while casting a smaller shadow.But with the rear seats down, the longer, wider Versa has the biggest cargo area: 50.4 cubic feet, compared with 41.9 for the Fit and only 25.7 for the Yaris.Still, for a vehicle whose very name is intended to evoke an image of versa-tility, the Versa isn’t nearly as flexible as the Honda Fit. The Fit’s seats flip, flop and dive to form four distinct configurations. In one mode, the rear seats fold into the floor to form a very low, completely flat cargo hold.Although the Versa’s rear seatbacks fold flat, the seats don’t go into the floor like the Fit’s. As a result, the storage in the rear ends up being lower than the area just behind the front seats, creating a two-zone compartment. All in all, the arrangement is rather clunky.The Versa is not just larger than these competitors, it is heavier — outweighing my Yaris test car by 400 pounds and the Fit by 170. It should be no surprise, then, that its gas mileage isn’t as good.On a trip from Nashville to Cleveland, I averaged 31.8 miles per gallon on one segment and 30.1 on the other. My driving included highway travel slightly above the speed limit, along with some enthusiastic sprints on hilly two-lane roads in southern Ohio. With the continuously variable transmission, the Versa is officially rated at 30 m.p.g. in town and 36 on the highway.Earlier, I had averaged 37.4 m.p.g. in the Yaris and 35.5 in the Fit in two days of spirited driving out West.The Versa’s interior generally has a high-quality feel, with attractive, tightly woven upholstery. Padding and soft materials cushion high touch areas like the armrests and door trim. But like many other automakers, Nissan has trouble making black dashboards look rich. The beige interior looks much better.The 1.8-liter engine is new, delivering class-leading horsepower (122) and torque (127 foot-pounds). It is paired with a redesigned continuously variable transmission.The engine ran fairly quietly during my 600-mile drive except for times when I insisted on more than modest acceleration. Then it would give out a moan that might have indicated dismay or the joyous unleashing of its innermost mechanical passion. (I never figured out which.) The car droned around 1,500 r.p.m. under light acceleration.A six-speed manual is also available. This month, a four-speed automatic will be offered as a stopgap measure because the supplier of the continuously variable transmissions cannot deliver all the units Nissan needs for the Versa and the Sentra.To compensate for jarring American roads, Nissan has made some suspension changes from the European model. For a small car, the Versa rides quite comfortably.In southern Ohio, we left the interstate for playtime on the Appalachian Highway (Ohio Route 32). On wide, sweeping turns, I found the electric power steering to be linear and predictable, but on Route 327 out of Londonderry, where turns became tighter — more of an L shape than a C — the Versa posed a challenge to my confidence.The problem was its initial tippy-feeling body lean on entering a turn. But I found that the body settled down pretty quickly, the leaning ended and it was possible to proceed quickly and confidently. Still, the body lean meant that transitions from a tight turn to another in the opposite direction were not as quick as I would have liked.For me, the Fit remains the champ when it comes to driving dynamics, including steering response.In addition to its larger engine, the Versa offers upscale options not available from Honda or Toyota: a sunroof, Bluetooth hands-free phone system with wireless connections and a smart key with a sensor that unlocks the car as you approach it. You can also get satellite radio, with a choice of XM or Sirius.Six air bags are standard on all Versas (including side curtain and side impact bags), and the Nissan’s front seats have active head restraints, which move forward in a rear-impact crash to protect against whiplash injuries.Have American attitudes changed enough that small cars like the Versa can make it here? Automakers and market research firms expect sales to grow, although projections vary. Still, the Fit and Yaris seem to be off to a good start. The Versa, with more rear legroom and cargo space, offers a significantly different choice.And it makes another powerful argument in favor of downsizing.'"
"'06-09-10,'0','LATE on a recent Friday evening, James Ellroy greeted a visitor who had dropped by his apartment and asked how he was with the following: “I’m lean, mean and obscene.” At 6-foot-3, 180 pounds, with a penchant for the vulgar, he means it.His bald head and sharp, long body hold the tension of a rocket waiting to be launched. His height lends him a natural air of authority, even if the awkward young man he describes himself as being (“I was 130 pounds back then and probably 30 of it was zits”) is still visible in the fierce 58-year-old man he has become.Mr. Ellroy, the tortured yet talkative, lascivious but solicitous noir novelist, had recently returned to Los Angeles after a self-imposed 25-year exile. On this evening, he was indulging in the company of his closest confidant, the novelist Bruce Wagner.They were headed to dinner to celebrate the film of Mr. Ellroy’s 1987 novel “The Black Dahlia,” which opens on Friday, and the release of Mr. Wagner’s latest novel, “Memorial,” on Sept. 5. They would be joined by some usual suspects: three homicide detectives from the Los Angeles Police Department, longtime friends of Mr. Ellroy.The two men arrived at the Pacific Dining Car, an 85-year-old downtown restaurant famous for its steaks. Mr. Ellroy is so fond of the place that he married his second wife, Helen Knode, there. He ordered his usual drink: four shots of espresso in a single coffee cup and a glass of ice. He alternated sipping the espresso with crunching on the ice.'"
"'06-09-10,'0','RECENT university graduates bound for New York regularly end up in Murray Hill. Its rental buildings — large, full of people and somewhat prosaic — may just recall their old college dormitories.Some developers, however, are betting that recent arrivals to the neighborhood might prefer nonstudent-type housing and that they might be willing to buy rather than rent.One decidedly nonstudent-type building, a 22-story condominium at 225 East 34th Street, between First and Second Avenues, is the Charleston. When completed next summer, it will have 190 units, ranging from 540-square-foot studios to 1,712-square-foot three-bedrooms; a majority will be one-bedrooms.Equipped with many of the usual luxury-condo amenities like stainless steel appliances, the Charleston will also offer a 1,000-square-foot dog run on its roof deck, complete with views of the Empire State Building.Its sales office opens on Sept. 17, and prices will range from $595,000 to $2.2 million, according to a spokesman for LCOR, the project’s developer, which is based in Berwyn, Pa.'"
"'06-09-10,'0','In the 1970’s Lagos was the nexus of a stirring intellectual renaissance and a wave of sprawling, megalomaniacal urban planning projects. That optimism evaporated with the drop in oil prices at the end of the decade, and the city was left to fend for itself.Today, the Nigerian government is trying to resurrect some of the old planning projects, clamp down on illegal street trade and rein in urban indiscipline in general. Yet in eight years of research, Mr. Koolhaas realized that what seems like chaos to outsiders is a complex and highly organized social organism. His analysis suggests that a democratic, informal urban planning model could be combined with aggressive planning to lift Lagos out of poverty without destroying the spontaneous freedom of daily urban life.“In Lagos there is no choice, but there are countless ways to articulate the condition of no choice,” Mr. Koolhaas has said. “In New York, on the other hand, there’s a sense of infinite choice, but a very conventional set of options from which to choose.”Of course Mr. Koolhaas, now 62, has been known for countering conventional wisdom about how cities really work since the publication of “Delirious New York,’’ a 1978 book casting the “city of congestion” as an antidote to the sterility of Modernist planning conventions. Today, he is joined by a younger generation of architects who are no longer content to consider architecture in isolation from larger urban patterns. Among them is Mr. Oswalt, 42, who has organized a show that arrives in December at the Van Alen Institute in New York and the Pratt Manhattan Gallery. Titled “Shrinking Cities,” it examines the shrinking industrial centers on the fringes of the emerging global economy.The show sheds light on the abysmal failure of planners to avert the gradual disintegration of cities like Leipzig, Germany; Ivanovo, Russia; and Detroit. The phenomenon of decay is often juxtaposed with a different form of assault: the insidious encroachment of suburban values. New Yorkers need only stroll through SoHo to get the point.The exhibition, which originally opened in Berlin 2004, also resurrects some largely forgotten critiques of urbanization. It touches on the Disurbanist proposals of Soviet Constructivists like Moisei Ginzburg and Mikhail Barshch, who challenged the thinking behind Western urban traditions in favor of a more rural Russian model, and Frank Lloyd Wright’s Broadacre City, in which each family would be allotted an acre of land and the agglomeration would serve as a decentralized metropolis.But the show’s most penetrating attacks are reserved for more recent urban strategies, particularly the argument that the salvation of cities rests in a so-called “creative class” that leads the way to gentrification.“Shrinking Cities” is to travel in February to Detroit, where, a bit paradoxically, it will go on view in an abandoned 21,000-square-foot warehouse that will be the temporary home of the Museum of Contemporary Art Detroit. Designed by Andrew Zago, the museum is being opened, in part, with the goal of revitalizing the city center.Finally, Mr. Weisman, an Israeli-born architect who is the recipient this year of the prestigious Stirling Prize for architecture, will open a series of lectures this fall at the Canadian Center for Architecture in Montreal. The talks are pegged to the release of “Hollow Land: The Architecture of Israeli Occupation,” a chilling book in which he explores the way the military selects targets in bombing and fortifying cities and how those strategies can re-emerge in civilian planning practices during peacetime.His analysis is ideally timed. If the Modernist mass-housing programs of a half-century ago reduced a generation of urban poor to mere numbers in a machine, many of those projects are now being wiped away to make room for an equally troubling formula: gated communities, open-air malls and sanitized tourist enclaves that have exacerbated social inequities by making destitute children invisible.Acknowledging the complexity of these issues is not enough. Thankfully, some architects have assumed the challenge of binding us back into a civilization whose fabric often seems on the verge of unraveling.'"
"'06-09-10,'0','FEW directorial debuts in recent years have raised such high expectations as “In the Bedroom,” Todd Field’s adaptation of the Andre Dubus short story “Killings.” That drama won five Oscar nominations, including best picture, actor and actress (for Tom Wilkinson and Sissy Spacek); and Mr. Field received an award from the New York Film Critics Circle for best first film. Now, five years later, comes “Little Children,” his screen adaptation of Tom Perrotta’s satirically edged 2004 novel of contemporary suburban life and its discontents.In light of its forerunner the choice makes perfect sense. As he demonstrated with “In the Bedroom,” Mr. Field, an actor turned director, scans the depths of his characters’ souls and sees them whole. This psychological radar is a gift he shares with Mr. Perrotta, with whom he wrote the screenplay for “Little Children.”The double-edged title refers not only to the suburban kids who more or less run their parents’ lives, but also to the 30- and 40-something adults whose needy inner children cry out for release. One of its wistful themes is that, like it or not, having children brings your own youth to a crashing halt; you’re no longer at the center of things.The story’s emotional lightning rod is Ronald James McGorvey, a damaged middle-aged man who has recently returned to live with his mother after serving time for exposing himself to children. He is a pariah in their suburban Boston community and a focus of its collective fears, embodied by Larry Hedges, a disgraced former cop with a violent streak who wants to hound him out of town.In one of the novel’s most disturbing scenes, Ronald’s presence at a public swimming pool on a brutally hot day precipitates mass panic among the assembled mothers watching over their children. In the film Ronald is played by the former child star Jackie Earle Haley. His powerfully creepy portrayal is a pointed departure from the standard screen image of the child molester or flasher as an ordinary guy with an unfortunate kink.'"
"'06-09-10,'0','In almost all cases, the professors found, the stocks promoted in these messages do not trade on major exchanges. Instead, they tend to be illiquid and are found in the off-market, over-the-counter trading arena known as the Pink Sheets. Typically, such stocks are not followed regularly by an investment adviser or Wall Street research department. Their illiquidity, and the absence of regular scrutiny, make the stocks relatively easy to manipulate, the professors said.To compile a database of stock-touting spam, the researchers combed through the 26,000 junk messages that Professor Zittrain received in his own e-mail box from January 2004 to July 2005. They also surveyed 1.8 million specimens of spam received during that time by the Internet newsgroup called Nanas (for net.admin.network.abuse.sightings), which alerts administrators of e-mail networks to spam outbreaks. While Nanas has many contributors around the world, the professors concede that there “is no way to assure that Nanas’s archive is a representative cross-section” of all spam.All told, some 300 stocks were recommended in the studied messages, each of which contained a time-stamp indicating when it was sent. Because not all of the messages hyping a particular stock were delivered at precisely the same time, or even on the same day, the professors focused on the day when the greatest number of messages touting a certain stock were received. On that day, they found, the stock was 13 times more likely to be the most actively traded Pink Sheet issue than it was on days when they had no evidence that junk e-mail was sent urging its purchase.The increased liquidity created by this higher volume is crucial to the success of the spammers’ pump-and-dump strategy, according to the professors. If not for that greater liquidity, in fact, the spammers would find that their sell orders would depress prices so much that they would realize little if any profit.Sure enough, the professors found a distinct price pattern in the touted stocks. It pointed unambiguously to spammers buying stock before the days when they sent their messages and selling as those messages were received.On average, a touted stock gained 4.6 percent more than comparable issues on the trading day just before the spam’s peak volume day. On the peak volume day itself — when the professors believe that the spammers sell the bulk of their shares — the stock’s price stayed more or less even. But one trading day later, the return was 5.9 percent lower than that of comparable issues.The professors concluded that unscrupulous traders were able to turn a tidy profit by buying shares before sending their spam and then selling as investors started acting on the spam’s advice. In contrast, investors who bought shares realized a sizable loss.In an interview, Professor Frieder said she was initially skeptical that investors were actually following the advice in stock-touting junk e-mail. After all, few people ever say they welcome spam; most seem eager to zap it from their computers. But her skepticism faded after analyzing the data. “I am aware of no other plausible explanation for the patterns we found,” she said.She said that the authors based their conclusions entirely on an analysis of aggregate data, not on a study of particular cases, so they had no proof that any individuals in particular were directing such schemes.IN any event, Professor Zittrain said in an interview, the Securities and Exchange Commission has rarely tried to prevent stock-touting spam messages, many of which contain fine print disclosing that the spammer will be selling the very stock being recommended for purchase.Of course, the most immediate lesson for investors is this: ignore unsolicited e-mail messages. But there is also a broader lesson, relevant even for those who ignore spam. It has do with the desire, even eagerness, to believe that there is a stock out there that could make a lot of money, and with how that desire affects people’s judgment. As Professor Zittrain put it, “greed all too easily colors our objectivity,” and it’s true for all types of investors.'"
"'06-09-10,'0','I reserved a superior room at a New York hotel, with a king-size bed and view, with Expedia. On arrival, we were shown a standard room with double beds; after refusing three rooms, we were upgraded to a standard room with double beds and a view; we accepted. We were told that there is no guarantee of room type through Expedia. Is this correct? — Gil Faclier, TorontoI think it is. In my experience, most booking sites have allocations of mainly standard rooms. If you have exact requirements, it is a good idea to call the hotel and make yourself known — that is, become a name rather than a number. I recently booked a room at a very good price at the Hôtel de la Paix in Lausanne, Switzerland, through hotel-bargain.co.uk, a site that offers discounted rates. I called the hotel to doublecheck my reservation and found I had a standard room, so I decided to upgrade to a superior lake-view room at extra cost.Reservation sites I have found useful include All-hotels.com, for worldwide reservations; Hotels.com, especially for discounts in the United States; and Tripadvisor.com, for its user reviews (with booking links), but watch for reviewers who praise their own hotels or criticize a rival. Again, however you book, it’s best to call the hotel to check exactly what kind of room you can expect.Several readers have pointed out that most travel sites tend to offer only standard rooms. Eric Peeters in Dallas, Tex., writes: “Are you aware of sites that offer discounts on more upscale rooms, such as suites, for stays of five days or more?”There are a number of sites offering good rates for upscale rooms for short or longer stays.

Just below the water’s surface is a surrounding coral reef, where even novice snorkelers can glimpse a gorgeous array of tropical fish. Wade out to Snoopy Island using the private beach at Sandy Beach Hotel and Resort (971-9-244-5555; www.sandybm.com), where day passes cost 40 dirhams for nonguests.For more serious snorkelers and divers, the east coast abounds with spots less traveled, which provide a wider array of wildlife and room for deeper exploration. Scuba 2000 (971-9-2388-477; www.scuba-2000.com), a snorkeling and diving center about 15 minutes south of Snoopy Island, goes to dozens of dive sites along the coast, from easier ones like Dibba rock, to the Inchcape shipwrecks, where experienced divers can explore at depths as great as 100 feet.But the best diving in the United Arab Emirates, says Dewi Srulatri, assistant manager of Scuba 2000, is at Martini Rock, a nearby multilevel coral outcropping with dives ranging from 40 to 70 feet, where divers can see lion fish, trigger fish and even the occasional small shark. Prices vary; a single dive with full equipment rental is 235 dirhams.WETLANDS AND WILDLIFE Another reason to visit the area during autumn and spring is to watch wildlife in various wetlands and reserves in the emirates, a major stop for about 300 species of migrating birds.Rapid development threatens much of the emirates’ wetlands, so you should see them while you can. One such spot lies off the emirate of Umm al-Quwain, about an hour northeast of Dubai. The Khor al-Beidah, a shallow lagoon dotted with small, dense mangrove islands, is a seasonal home to many water birds. At places like the Flamingo Beach Resort (971-6-765-0001; www.flamingoresort.ae) nonguests can hire a boat (180 dirhams an hour) to tour the lagoon and spy on flocks of flamingoes, herons and cranes, a reprieve from the city.For something closer, take a quick trip to the tidal lagoon at Dubai Creek (Khor Dubai), where a broad swatch of dense mangroves was set aside in early 2005 for wildlife preservation. Three viewing stations, just off the highway, provide telescopes through which visitors can gaze at dozens of bird species, including flamingoes, Kentish plovers, white egrets, gray and longbeak herons and Caspian terns, all against the backdrop of the Dubai skyline.One of the emirates’ wildlife centerpieces is Sir Bani Yas, a 30-square-mile island just off the coast of Jebel Dhanna, about 150 miles west of the city of Abu Dhabi. Once the private reserve of the former president, Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan al-Nahyan, the island has been groomed for years as a wildlife sanctuary. But, little by little, it is opening up.For now, the Danat Resort Jebel Dhanna (971-2-801-2222; www.ncth.com/danat-hotels.php) offers the only land-based tours to the island (9 a.m. Thursdays and Fridays, weather permitting). As of early September, the island’s mangrove wetlands were closed to protect its resident birds, but visitors can see thousands of other animals, including captive-bred oryx, giraffes and gazelles. Tours are 200 dirhams for guests, 375 for nonguests.THE ARABIAN DESERT Under the shade of palmettos by the sea, it’s easy to forget that Dubai sits at the edge of the Arabian Desert, a 900,000-square-mile expanse of sand and rock, second only in size to the Sahara.The 1960’s oil boom upended the emirates’ nomadic social landscape, as people flocked to rapidly growing cities. But locals haven’t forgotten their Bedouin past: “dune bashing” excursions are still popular. Shorter-term visitors can try one of many tour companies around Dubai, like Alpha Tours, (971-4-294-9888; www.alphatoursdubai.com). About 25 miles southeast of Dubai City, they’ll zip you across the desert in air-conditioned 4x4’s, climbing towering dunes and barreling down them at angles close to 90 degrees. Many operators take early evening tours so visitors can see the sun setting over the desert’s glowing red sands. Afterward, the caravan heads to a Bedouin-style camp, complete with shisha pipes, camel rides and a smorgasbord of Middle Eastern food. A belly dancer performance ends the night before everyone heads home. Trips with Alpha Tours cost about 260 dirhams a person.Eco-tourism is still a fledging industry in the United Arab Emirates. One option is to stay in a desert eco-lodge like Al Maha Desert Resort and Spa, (971-4-303-4222; www.al-maha.com), which offers camel and horseback treks through the desert to guests. Suites start at between $700 and $1,500 a night, depending on the season.Usually less expensive operators like Arabian Adventures (971-4-303-4888; www.arabian-adventures.com), based in Dubai and Abu Dhabi, offer custom-made, single- or multiday itineraries that can go much deeper into the desert wilderness — perfect for spotting native wildlife like Arabian gazelles and beisa oryx. Some of the tours let you drive the vehicles yourself. At Arabian Adventures, custom overnight trips into the Dubai Desert Conservation Reserve, for example, start at 630 dirhams a person.'"

"'06-09-11,'1','For nearly two years after 9/11, Kathy Maloney of Farmingville, Long Island, tried to stick with her job as an intensive care unit nurse. She would attend the dying and comfort survivors, forcing herself to murmur words that used to spring from the heart. But her husband, Joseph, a firefighter with Ladder Company 3 in Manhattan, “was 45 and ripped from my life, while these poor people were agonizing over grandmas dying of a terminal illness. I couldn’t stand by the bedside and offer any hope.”To her children’s complete relief, she became a school nurse, rotating between Meg’s middle school and Joe’s high school. All three Maloneys, still rattled by the death of the handsome, devoted prankster, need to know each other’s whereabouts. That’s why Mrs. Maloney has let the junior varsity football team hang out in her backyard this summer.In 2001, The Times’s Portraits of Grief described Mrs. Maloney as “pretty, tough-talking.” Now, her laughing-through-tears voice cracking, Mrs. Maloney says, “I’m not as tough as I used to be, and I don’t think I’m as pretty.” This summer she was treated for Crohn’s disease and rheumatoid arthritis. “These last five years,” she adds, “have been horrendous.”'"
"'06-09-11,'1','“The cliché is that time heals all wounds,” Michael Casey said. “But I don’t want to say it’s easier after five years. Maybe it’s just less hard.”In the years after his wife, Neilie, left Boston on a business trip on American Airlines Flight 11, which crashed into the north tower, “I wanted to get my arms around the grief quickly, but the nature of 9/11 was unprecedented,” he said. “You’d like to get away from 9/11. But you don’t want people to forget.”Mr. Casey, now 38, was a Boston advertising executive. He quit to become a portrait-and-documentary photographer because “I sought something that had more meaning.”He was married in 2005 to Lisa Hughes, evening anchor at the CBS affiliate in Boston, WBZ-TV, after they met through friends. On the morning of Sept. 11, she had taken an earlier jet than Flight 11 from Boston on a day trip to New York. Driving into Manhattan, she was stunned to see the trade center aflame. She stayed a week to report the disaster.Of Mr. Casey’s daughter with Neilie — Riley, now 5 — he said that “when she’s curious about the role of 9/11 in our family’s life, Lisa and I will answer those questions for her.”Mr. Casey has installed, and will maintain, a seaside bench bearing a plaque to Neilie at the 1876 Nobska Lighthouse in Woods Hole on Cape Cod, “in the most beautiful place,” he said, “with the most beautiful view.”'"

"'06-09-11,'1','Rising ocean temperatures linked by some studies to tropical storms are very likely a result of global warming caused by greenhouse gas emissions, according to new research. The lead author of the new study, Benjamin D. Santer of the Energy Department’s Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, said the findings suggested that further warming would probably make hurricanes stronger in coming decades.But while environmentalists and some researchers have asserted that storms like Hurricane Katrina were measurably stronger because of human-caused warming, Dr. Santer said his study did not address that issue.The study was published online today by The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.The researchers compared a century of observed temperature changes with those produced in more than 80 computer simulations of how oceans respond to both natural and human-generated influences on the climate. The simulations were generated on 22 different computer models at 15 different research centers.The simulations correctly mimicked the cooling caused by plumes from volcanic eruptions, which temporarily block the sun. At the same time, the authors said, the only warming influence that could explain the measured changes in the oceans was the buildup of heat-trapping smokestack and tailpipe gases in the air.Earlier studies concluded that global warming from human activities was warming the oceans, but this analysis was the first to thoroughly examine trends in particular tropical regions of the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans that serve as nurseries for the destructive storms.Several climate experts said that while debate persisted about the role of warming in pumping up hurricanes, there was little doubt about the long-term trend should warming continue as projected.'"
"'06-09-11,'1','While OPEC producers have been pumping at their highest level since 1979 to drive crude prices down from that peak, geopolitical tensions in the Middle East and the threat of another severe hurricane season in the Gulf of Mexico have kept oil markets on edge.But the hurricane season has so far proven benign, the United Nations has not moved to sanction Iran over its nuclear enrichment program, and the war in Lebanon ended in a ceasefire without escalating into a wider regional conflict. These factors helped push prices down in recent weeks. In addition, the American economy seems to be softening.OPEC now must shift its attention to a question it managed to avoid for much of the past year: How far should oil prices be allowed to fall before the cartel steps in with production cuts?Agreeing on a floor price is not going to be easy, analysts said. Since OPEC scrapped its quota mechanism and opened its spigots all the way last year, OPEC ministers have become increasingly comfortable with oil priced above $70 a barrel, a level that once would have been considered disastrous for the global economy. After that experience, settling on a “reasonable” new price to defend will be tricky.OPEC is next scheduled to meet in December in Nigeria. But “if there is a deterioration in the global economy and prices fall quickly, then we will need a meeting before December,” said Chakib Khelil, Algeria’s oil minister, a view echoed by other delegates.The oil ministers from Qatar and Venezuela, Abdullah bin Hamad al-Attiyah and Rafael Ramirez, said today that a production cut may be on the table at the next meeting. Kazem Vaziri Hamaneh, Iran’s oil minister, said that oil prices should not be allowed to fall below $60 a barrel.Yasser Elguindi, a senior managing director at Medley Global Advisers, a consulting firm for hedge funds, said, “Prices are still high and OPEC wants them to come down. But it is good for them to start looking at their supplies.”OPEC’s current output quota will remain at 28 million barrels a day for the time being. Including Iraq, which is a member of the cartel but is not bound by the quota system, the 11 member nations now produce about 30 million barrels a day.Not everyone was concerned by the drop in prices — at least so far.“Don’t take this blip as significant,” Ali Al-Naimi, Saudi Arabia’s oil minister, told reporters in Vienna. “This is a cyclical business. It’s not the first time prices go up or prices go down.”“Market fundamentals are very sound,” Mr. Naimi said. “We are beginning to see a slight decrease in economic growth, very slight.” But he added, “It is nothing alarming.”For the moment, OPEC still has very little spare capacity to make up for any shortage in oil supplies around the world. But that lack of spare capacity — which many analysts believe was one of the main causes of the rally in oil prices — might be coming to an end soon.One major consideration for OPEC in the coming month is the knowledge that large volumes of fresh oil supplies will reach the market next year from nonmember nations.The biggest increases are likely to come from Russia, from African producers like Angola, and from the former Soviet republics around the Caspian Sea.In addition, several OPEC nations plan capacity increases of their own, and alternatives to crude oil like ethanol, biodiesel and liquefied gases are also stepping up supplies.Even Iraq is sounding optimistic about its prospects. The country’s oil minister, Hussain Al-Shahristani, told reporters in Vienna that his country expected to improve security in its oil-producing regions to help expand its industry. He said Iraq needs some $20 billion in fresh investment to step up production capacity to 4 million to 4.5 million barrels a day; it now produces about 2.3 million to 2.4 million barrels a day, he said.“Everyone agrees that the oil sector needs a huge investment, and should be the locomotive of the economy,” Mr. Al-Shahristani said.Given all these developments, if demand growth moderates as many economists expect, and there is no sudden interruption in oil supplies, OPEC will probably need to consider cuts in production to stop prices from falling too much.“There is no consensus on a price target,” said Vera de Ladoucette, an oil analyst with Cambridge Energy Research Associates. “Saudi Arabia can worry about oil prices at around $50 a barrel. But many others will want prices above $60. Meanwhile, on the market, oil prices are going down — but when consumers go to fill up their tanks, they don’t see it much.”'"

"'06-09-11,'1','The Brooklyn district attorney’s office says he helped an informant in the mob, Gregory Scarpa Sr., kill four times in the 1980’s and early 1990’s, so that Mr. Scarpa could rid himself of rivals and win bloody battles in a war within the Colombo family.To a federal agent, there is nothing more toxic than a corruption charge — which even by association can ruin a career. And the charges faced by Mr. DeVecchio are radioactive: that he gave secret information to Mr. Scarpa in exchange for $66,000.Which makes it all the more remarkable that 19 former F.B.I. agents have put their names and reputations on the line to save their troubled friend. These were not the bureaucrats or pencil pushers of the New York office, but its veteran undercover and investigative men.“We’ve all worked with Lin since the early 1970’s,” said Joseph D. Pistone, the real-life Donnie Brasco, who infiltrated the Bonanno crime family as an undercover agent in the 1970’s.“We’re all veteran street guys,” Mr. Pistone said. “If anyone could smell something bad, it would be us. And with Lin, we never smelled bad.”The so-called Friends of Lin DeVecchio have a total of 480 years of street experience, give or take a few, and while most spend their time these days on a golf course or at the shore, they remain encyclopedic on the subject of the mob.Who knows better than us, they say, what happened 20 years ago at Carmine Sessa’s bar or at Larry Lampesi’s house near McDonald Avenue in Brooklyn? (Both places will figure prominently at trial.)“We gathered the information,” said James M. Kossler, who from 1979 to 1989 was Mr. DeVecchio’s boss.Much of that information has been posted on a Web site, www.lindevecchio.com, which attempts to refute the state indictment with transcripts of federal trials and with private F.B.I. reports called 302’s. There is information about how to donate money toward Mr. DeVecchio’s legal expenses.The Web site also levels personal attacks against the state’s lead prosecutor, Michael Vecchione; its chief witness, Linda Schiro, Mr. Scarpa’s former companion; and Sandra Harmon, who is a self-described relationship coach and the co-author with Priscilla Presley of a tell-all book on Elvis Presley, and who had planned to write a book with Ms. Schiro but wrote one instead about Mr. Scarpa’s son.Mr. DeVecchio’s supporters make no bones about their deep disdain for the Brooklyn district attorney, Charles J. Hynes, who they say considers a good Mafia case to be rounding up gamblers on Super Bowl Sunday.“Here you have a rackets bureau that doesn’t know a thing about organized crime,” Mr. Kossler said. “They don’t know what they’re doing. If they had a track record of making great O.C. cases, fine — but they don’t.”The bad blood between the state and the F.B.I. goes back many years, to at least 1992, when Mr. Scarpa went into hiding after Brooklyn prosecutors obtained a warrant for his arrest on a gun possession charge. From April to August of that year, court papers say, Mr. Scarpa met or spoke with Mr. DeVecchio seven times, but the F.B.I. neither informed the state of his whereabouts nor arrested Mr. Scarpa.Jerry Schmetterer, a spokesman for Mr. Hynes, waved off accusations that the office was incompetent.“These people who are making these allegations can’t possibly know the depth of the evidence we have compiled to make this case,” he said.Part of that evidence is likely to include the testimony of Lawrence Mazza, Mr. Scarpa’s one-time disciple, who has already told investigators that Mr. Scarpa had a friend in law enforcement, whom he used to call “the girlfriend.”Mr. Mazza, who now works at a gym in southern Florida, said that several weeks ago, one of the retired agents paid him a visit. Without saying exactly what happened, he said the agent had tried to intimidate him in connection with the case.Mr. Kossler scoffed at the charge, saying the former agent had gone to Florida merely to interview Mr. Mazza on Mr. DeVecchio’s behalf. As a witness for the prosecution, Mr. Mazza is of obvious interest to the defense, he said.While the prosecution has said in court that intimidation of witnesses may have occurred, it will not publicly discuss Mr. Mazza’s accusation.At its core, the DeVecchio case is about the tenuous give-and-take that exists between an agent and a confidential source.Prosecutors say that Mr. DeVecchio abused that give-and-take, giving Mr. Scarpa names and addresses of men who wound up dead.Mr. DeVecchio has said that in the 12 years he “ran” Mr. Scarpa, he never leaked a secret and never received anything more than a Cabbage Patch doll, a bottle of wine and a pan of lasagna.As for the Friends of Lin DeVecchio, they maintain it takes a special sort of man to handle Mafia informants. He must speak the language of the street and of the F.B.I. He must appreciate the criminal mind without admiring it. He must be able to cultivate trust among those who trust no one but themselves.“That’s the fine line the agent has to walk — to always remember who he is and who he’s dealing with,” said Christopher Mattice, who served for many years as the F.B.I.’s informant coordinator in New York.“You have to talk the language and make them understand you understand what’s going on.”And most important, he said, you must remember that no conversation between an agent and a mole takes place in a vacuum. Questions fashioned to elicit information give information: If Agent X asks about Gangster Y, it means that he is interested in Gangster Y. If Gangster Y winds up dead, is that Agent X’s fault?For now, Mr. DeVecchio’s trial is scheduled to open at the beginning of next year, and his federal friends are planning to attend.“The bond is very close,” said Douglas E. Grover, Mr. DeVecchio’s lawyer. “It’s not just that they worked together; it’s like they were in the Army together, like they went through the wars.”Should things go poorly for Mr. DeVecchio, his supporters will not quit, they say.“We’ll continue to do what we’re doing,” Mr. Kossler said. “We’ll fight this as far as it has to go.”'"
"'06-09-11,'1','PODGORICA, Montenegro, Monday, Sept. 11 — Prime Minister Milo Djukanovic of Montenegro, the longest-serving political leader in the Balkans, appears to have secured four more years in office, according to unofficial results from parliamentary elections held Sunday.The results showed that Mr. Djukanovic’s coalition had won a majority in the 81-seat Parliament. It was unclear if the coalition had won an absolute majority of votes. Official results were expected later Monday.The election was the first in Montenegro, which has a population of 630,500 and is the smallest nation in the Balkans, since it broke from Serbia after an independence referendum in May.Mr. Djukanovic, who has led Montenegro for 15 years, seemed to benefit from its rapid entry into the United Nations and disarray among opposition parties that had fought to retain ties with Serbia.'"
"'06-09-11,'1','President Hu Jintao has intensified a crackdown on all kinds of news media in recent months, arresting and harassing journalists, tightening regulation of Web sites and online forums, hiring tens of thousands of people to screen and block Web content deemed offensive and firing editors of state-run publications that resist official controls.Chinese authorities promise that they will allow thousands of outside journalists to visit China during the 2008 Olympics in Beijing and allow them to report freely on developments here.Some Western media watchdog groups say the new restrictions and a sharp increase in the number of journalists being prosecuted for their work have raised doubts about whether Beijing will honor those promises.The New China News Agency has long played a dual role in China’s media world. It acts both as the official distributor of state news and information, selling its products much as any Western news agencies would do. But it also regulates outside news agencies, a power that Western news providers say it seeks to use to enhance its own bottom line.A decade ago, the New China News Agency sought to take control of the lucrative business of providing live news and data feeds to banks and financial firms in China, determining pricing, policing content and collecting the revenue.The industry, dominated by big Western agencies like Reuters and Bloomberg, successfully fought those restrictions. They have continued to market their products directly to brokers and traders in China rather than providing all services through the New China News Agency.It was not immediately clear if the new restrictions are a fresh attempt by the Chinese agency to take over that business, which is valued in the tens of millions of dollars. The dispatch said the new rules replace those promulgated in 1996 and subsequently watered down after vigorous protests.The wording of the announcement is broad enough to include all forms of foreign news and information, including those from Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan.“Foreign news agencies shall not directly solicit subscriptions of their news and information services in China,” the New China News Agency said in announcing the rules, adding that it had “the right to select the news and information released by foreign news agencies in China and shall delete any materials” it deemed harmful.Among the categories of news that will be banned is anything that may “endanger China’s national security, reputation and interests.” China will also censor news articles that violate religious policies, promote cults or superstition, or “incite hatred and discrimination among ethnic groups.”The prohibition on distribution means that the New China News Agency itself intends to act as the sales agent for foreign news providers that want to sell information or services to Chinese clients, likely taking a big cut of the revenue.In the past, Western media companies have said that such strong-arm tactics may violate China’s obligations under the World Trade Organization.'"
"'06-09-11,'1','He is, in fact, something rarer. He is resistant to conventional wisdom, to any view that says, “This is the right way, not that.” The opening days of the spring 2007 ready-to-wear season saw a similar resistance from Alice Roi and Karen Walker, a New Zealander showing in New York for the first time, though Mr. Cho’s clothes were the standout. These shows gave you an entirely different feeling about American fashion.Mr. Cho used metal zippers in an incredibly free way — bunching, twisting, spiraling them into shapes that veered between organic and majestic. A belled-sleeve top in papery white taffeta was striped, sailor style, with zippers and worn with a shapely black miniskirt. Against the bodice and hips of a taut silk dress, the zippers resembled serpents. Piled on shoulders, they became Roman ornament. Not limiting himself to one thought, he made the zippers integral to the cut of the clothes, for one dress winding a length of pink chiffon through vents rimmed by zippers.Each outfit was all the more entrancing because Mr. Cho took great care with the fit and proportions. After a break of several seasons from the runway, he seemed to ask himself what fashion needed, and the answer was something strong and energetic.Given the appetite for fashion these days, one has an easier time saying that design isn’t brain surgery and just give women pretty clothes that are fun. Why, then, do so many designers, in particular female designers, overthink something as simple as a floaty top or a summer dress? Ashleigh Verrier’s sweet clothes showed signs of improvement. Still, all the extra touches and flounces recalled the designer Valentina’s famous warning, “If you want ruffles, go to Macy’s.”Ms. Roi gives her clothes thought — this season, her starting point was skinheads — but then she lets go. Her clothes are a wonderful combination of a slightly bored disposition (especially, one feels, where men are concerned) and a light hand. The best example of this are loose, sleeveless jackets in what looks vaguely like unbleached muslin. Nothing in fashion implies the unfinished more than muslin, which is used in patternmaking. But the garments are also light, and that plays well to a young woman’s attitude about dressing.Ms. Roi’s clothes have something else that sets her apart, an urban toughness that feels authentic. In her show, there were boyish jackets, minijumpers and soft shorts in a faded print that brought to mind men’s pajamas. And there was always a feeling that she knew when to stop with the design process. “I’m a huge fan,” said Robert Burke, a retail consultant, who has given Ms. Roi advice from time to time. “She’s not following anybody. She does Alice.”Ms. Walker’s clothes fit into that chaotic, boy-girl informality we’ve seen for a while, but she has a natural sense of femininity that beats a lot of better-known labels. She offered oversize jackets with slouchy pants, crisp cotton minitunics over shorts and puffed organza blouses, and some patchy-looking knits with vegetable faces. She keeps everything simple and fun, but she doesn’t shirk on creativity.The Ruffian collection of Brian Wolk and Claude Morais, inspired by American architecture, was minimalist and polished, with glossy white miniskirts, bra tops and some extremely pretty organdy blouses. But the fancy fabrics and casual styles were often at odds. Angel Chang, a former assistant at Donna Karan, made a modest attempt to focus attention on the future, with fabrics that changed color and pattern according to body heat and light.From the men’s department, John Bartlett showed a straightforward sportswear collection, in creams and khaki, with saddle Oxfords. You can say that Steven Cox and Daniel Silver of Duckie Brown were daring in showing baggy styles evocative of slackers at a New England boarding school, but you can also say they were out of step.'"
"'06-09-11,'1','It is unlikely that the OPEC ministers will alter at Monday’s meeting their current policy of keeping markets well supplied with oil. But some of them are beginning to think about whether to cut output next year, an effort that would be aimed at keeping prices from declining further.One consideration is that a sharp infusion of new energy supplies is expected to hit the market from producers outside of OPEC. The biggest increases are likely to come from African producers like Angola, from Russia and from Caspian nations, and from unconventional sources of fuel like ethanol, biodiesel or liquefied gases.“OPEC will have to cut supplies at some point, it’s a no-brainer, but not until new supplies come on the market,” said Deborah White, an energy economist with Société Générale in Paris. “There were forecasts for substantial non-OPEC supplies for 2005, but everything is running late and behind schedule.”She added, “The only thing OPEC is capable of doing is setting a floor for prices, but not a ceiling.”Like most oil producers, OPEC’s 11 members have struggled to catch up with rising demand in the last two years. For some, production has dropped because of armed conflicts, like those in Iraq and Nigeria; for others, lower production has stemmed from restrictive policies at home, as in Iran and Venezuela.Still, oil prices have dropped. Crude oil futures on the New York Mercantile Exchange fell on Friday to their lowest level in five months. The light, sweet crude contract for October delivery closed at $66.25 a barrel.Oil markets seem to have evaded predictions that the price would rise to $100 a barrel, but they remain at the mercy of sudden production interruptions. The hurricane season is only at the halfway point, the United Nations may still agree to impose sanctions on Iran, and Nigeria’s output remains crimped by violence in the Niger Delta region.Oil traders have recently been encouraged by signs that the physical market — actual barrels that are traded — is oversupplied, helping bolster fuel stockpiles in the United States to higher-than-average levels and helping to push prices down. Commercial stockpiles of crude oil and products are 6 percent higher today than they were last summer.Greg Priddy, an analyst in Eurasia Group’s Global Energy practice, said: “We’ve had two sets of factors moving in opposite directions: fundamentals are pulling the market down a little. But the political issues like Iran and Nigeria are still around.”At a meeting in June 2005, OPEC set an official quota of 28 million barrels a day for all its members except Iraq, which has not had a production target for years. Since then, the group has met five times without changing its output goal.OPEC members are currently pumping about 27.8 million barrels of crude oil a day, 200,000 barrels less than the quota. With Iraq, the group’s output is closer to 30 million barrels a day.As a group, OPEC failed to anticipate the rapid growth in consumption from China and the United States, an oversight that contributed to a sharp increase in energy prices. Production disruptions in Alaska and the Gulf of Mexico, and geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, have increased fears of supply shortfalls in the global energy markets.But just a few weeks ago, oil analysts and forecasters were issuing bleaker predictions still. The Atlantic hurricane season was expected to be as bad as last year’s; Iran, a top oil producer, was defying the United Nations over a nuclear research program; and BP was forced to shut down a major field in Alaska because of a pipeline leak.Then there was a monthlong war in the Middle East, which sent oil prices spinning to their highest levels in three decades, almost $80. Gasoline prices soared in the middle of the driving summer season.But just as suddenly, the bubble seems to have deflated.So far, there has been only one major hurricane, compared with six at the same time last year, including Hurricane Katrina, which flooded New Orleans and shattered the offshore oil infrastructure in the Gulf of Mexico. The war between Israel and the Hezbollah in Lebanon stopped last month without escalating into a regional conflict. And the prospect of sanctions against Iran seemed further off Sunday, as Iranian and European negotiators appeared to make some headway in their discussions, which are also taking place here.Of course, oil prices have tripled in the last five years. But when adjusted for inflation, prices have yet to reach records from the 1970’s, which would translate into more than $90 a barrel in today’s prices.Regular gasoline averaged $2.68 a gallon last week, an 11 percent drop from last month, according to the Energy Department.'"
"'06-09-11,'1','Citigroup named Dean Barr as the head of its Tribeca Global Management unit, succeeding Tanya Styblo Beder, in an effort to jump-start the hedge fund unit’s sagging returns.Ms. Beder, 50, joined Citigroup in May 2004 to help build Tribeca, which oversees $2.1 billion in assets. A Citigroup spokesman, Jon Diat, said that Ms. Beder would remain an adviser to the bank.Mr. Barr, 45, who as head of so-called liquid investments at Citigroup Alternative Investments supervised Tribeca and Ms. Beder, will retain his previous responsibilities.Citigroup’s hedge funds had negative trading revenue in the three of the last six quarters. In the second quarter, the funds lost $43 million.“We believe these changes will further enhance the investment performance, operational efficiency and the strategic development of the business,” Mr. Barr and Lewis B. Kaden, Citigroup’s chief administrative officer and interim head of the alternative investments division, said a memorandum to employees last week.The alternative investment division earned $610 million in the first six months of 2006, down 18 percent from a year earlier. Citigroup reported net income of $10.9 billion for the period, an increase of about 4 percent.'"
"'06-09-11,'1','The computer industry, under the banner of “digital convergence,” has been looking longingly at the American living room for several years. Beginning in 1993, Microsoft tried to rally the cable industry under the banner of Cablesoft, an abortive effort to turn the home cable box into a Microsoft-based PC.More recently, Microsoft and Intel have invested millions in a slow-growing effort to offer Media Center PC’s that promise a single home entertainment box. Separately, Microsoft has been trying to start a business in Internet-based television technology, intended to arm telephone companies to compete with cable operators. And in January, Intel introduced a microprocessor system called Viiv, designed for PC-based digital entertainment. So far, it has found few backers.Despite proclaiming that its Macintosh computer is the center of a digital home strategy, Apple has taken only baby steps into the video era, offering iPods that play television videos on tiny screens and a software program called Front Row, largely hidden within the Mac, for managing video collections, music playlists and slide shows.Those efforts may become more aggressive on Tuesday, but so far Mr. Jobs has kept his strategy well hidden. Much speculation has centered on a living-room-ready version of the company’s least expensive computer, the Mac Mini, a compact desktop model originally positioned as an inexpensive way for PC users to switch to the Macintosh market. A living-room Mini could play DVD’s, download Internet data like digital movies and include a TV tuner.The downside of such a strategy, of course, is that it would be compared, perhaps unfavorably, with the dozens of similar devices already introduced in attempts to bring the Internet closer to the home television set. That might amount to yet another box in the living room — something Mr. Jobs and his designers choose to avoid.“Apple is genetically incapable of doing anything that smacks of me-too,” said Mike McGuire, research vice president at the market research firm Gartner.A more intriguing possibility discussed by former Apple engineers and on rumor sites like AppleInsider.com is that Apple may use wireless technologies like Wi-Fi and ultra-wideband to stream digital content from a Macintosh to the TV. Such a system would allow the video to be played on television screens with the computer’s hand-held Apple remote control.Such an approach would almost certainly appeal to Mr. Jobs’s spartan aesthetic. And it tracks well with one of Apple’s peripheral products, AirPort Express, which makes it possible to stream digital audio wirelessly to speakers in different rooms of a home.Moreover, such an approach would keep Hollywood digital video content locked up on a Macintosh and stream it to the TV using a connector called HDMI (High-Definition Multimedia Interface), which is engineered to offer copy protection.The obstacle to such a wireless video service is that such projects often run afoul of real-world wireless environments in the home, which are replete with interference from devices like microwave ovens, wireless video cameras and wireless phones, and uncooperative neighbors.Yet Mr. Jobs and Apple were pioneers in using Wi-Fi in their computers, and it is likely that he is looking for a way to renew Apple’s technological leadership in video.That is almost certain to make Tuesday’s event, to be held at a theater across the street from the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, one of Apple’s most closely watched product introductions.Mr. Jobs has repeatedly found ways to position Apple in front of important technology changes, and the convergence of the broadband Internet and a new generation of high-definition television has presented an opportunity for the company to play an even larger role in consumer electronics.According to Steve Perlman, a former Apple engineer who founded Moxi Digital in 1999 in an effort to create an integrated set-top box for the living room: “The ‘last mile’ problem of delivering broadband to the home has largely been solved. What remains is the ‘last hundred feet’ problem.” By that, he meant reliably delivering high-definition video to television sets using Internet-based technology.“Once that has been solved,” he said, “it will completely transform the entertainment landscape.”'"

When there is a friend in need or a condolence call to make, more cows.So it was, in this one-cow-fits-all spirit, that the elders of Enoosaen four years ago donated 14 prized bulls and heifers to the people of the United States to help ease the pain of the Sept. 11 attacks.But there was one little problem: the cattle — and how to get them from here to there.On Sunday, American diplomats returned to this town in the carpeted hills of southern Kenya and announced, much to the delight of the hundreds of Masai gathered in their best beaded finery, that the cattle were not going anywhere, especially not to the slaughterhouse.Instead, they will be blessed, and their offspring will be used to pay for education for the children of Enoosaen. To get the cow trust fund going, the Americans are donating 14 high school scholarships.“What you did to help us will not be forgotten,” said the new American ambassador to Kenya, Michael E. Ranneberger.'"

"'06-09-12,'1','The question has both scientific and legal implications. About 30,000 people have sued Merck, alleging that they or their families suffered heart attacks or strokes after taking Vioxx. Merck has argued that all painkillers appear to carry some heart risks, while many scientists say that Vioxx appears riskier than other medicines.Merck said Tuesday afternoon that it was preparing a response to the journal articles.Vioxx and Celebrex are part of a class of drugs developed in the 1990’s called cox-2 inhibitors. They are specifically designed to reduce pain and inflammation without causing stomach or gastrointestinal bleeding.In the first of the papers published yesterday, three researchers examined clinical trials conducted in the last decade on the cox-2 drugs. Their analysis showed that Vioxx was associated with increased rates of high blood pressure in 40 clinical trials covering 38,000 patients. High blood pressure, or hypertension, is closely linked to heart attacks and congestive heart failure. Vioxx was also associated with heart rhythm disturbances, kidney problems, and edema, or swelling.“This study merely confirms what has been known about Vioxx for several years,” said Eric Weinberg, a lawyer who represents people suing Merck over Vioxx. “It’s no surprise.”But the study’s authors also found that Celebrex, which is made by Pfizer and remains on the market, was associated with somewhat reduced rates of kidney problems and hypertension. The researchers examined 37 Celebrex trials, covering 45,000 patients. The other drugs, including Bextra, another Pfizer painkiller that has been withdrawn, had no association with kidney problems or hypertension.The analysis cannot confirm that Vioxx is uniquely dangerous or Celebrex uniquely safe. The drugs could cause heart problems in ways other than raising blood pressure, such as by increasing the risk of blood clots. But it provides an important signal that Vioxx may be more dangerous than Celebrex and other cox-2 drugs, said Eric Ding, one of the paper’s authors.“We cannot necessarily say all cox-2 drugs have similar adverse risk profiles, which has implications for the ethical development and testing of future drugs in this class,” Mr. Ding said.The second paper, written by two researchers at the University of New South Wales in Australia, examined the results of observational studies that covered the cox-2 drugs as well as older painkillers. The paper found that Vioxx had more heart risks than Celebrex, and that naproxen, an older painkiller, appeared to be even safer.'"
"'06-09-12,'1','WASHINGTON, Sept. 12 — The basic Medicare premium will rise next year to $93.50 a month, an increase of $5 a month, the Bush administration announced Tuesday, but for the first time, higher-income beneficiaries will be required to pay a surcharge.The standard premium is lower than expected. In May and again in July, Medicare officials estimated that it would be about $98 a month in 2007.Dr. Mark B. McClellan, administrator of the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, said that Medicare spending for doctors’ services, while still growing at a brisk pace, had increased less than expected.The premium in question is for Part B of Medicare, a voluntary program that covers doctors’ services, diagnostic tests and outpatient hospital care for 40 million people who are 65 and older or disabled. It shot up 50 percent from 2003 to 2006, when it reached $88.50 a month.Explaining the increase for 2007, Dr. McClellan reported “a modest slowdown in physician spending growth,” but “very rapid growth in spending for hospital outpatient services.”'"
"'06-09-12,'1','SAN FRANCISCO, Sept. 12 — Steven P. Jobs, Apple Computer’s chief executive, concluded a company event on Tuesday morning with his usual tease, noting that he had “one last thing” to introduce.Then, in an unusual departure from the company’s practice of announcing new products only when they are ready to ship, he talked about a product due out early next year that will be the company’s first step into the living room. The device, which Apple is calling iTV for now, will wirelessly stream video and music from a Macintosh computer or from the Internet to a television. The $299 box is about the size of a slim paperback novel.As expected, Apple also added movies to its iTunes Store. It will initially offer 75 movies for download from four studios, all owned by the Walt Disney Corporation, on whose board of directors Mr. Jobs sits. He is also the company’s largest individual shareholder.Other movie studios were conspicuously absent from the announcement. Some have resisted the idea of offering downloadable movies that might compete with lucrative DVD distribution channels.The iTV device places Apple squarely in the consumer electronics market and gives it a way to compete directly with Microsoft and PC industry giants like Dell and Hewlett-Packard, which are also eagerly eyeing ways to deliver entertainment beyond the PC screen. Apple is a late entrant to the living room market, which is already crowded with video players like the Xbox and PlayStation and Microsoft-based Media Center personal computers, along with extenders of every shape and function.'"

"'06-09-12,'1','Mr. Bok said students who were more affluent and sophisticated were the ones most likely to apply for early admission. More than a third of Harvard’s students are accepted through early admission. In addition, he said many early admissions programs require students to lock in without being able to compare financial aid offerings from various colleges.Mr. Bok also spoke about reducing the frenzy surrounding admissions. “I think it will improve the climate in high schools,” he said, “so that students don’t start getting preoccupied in their junior year about which college to go to.’’Many admissions deans and high school guidance counselors greeted Harvard’s decision — which is to go into effect for applicants in the fall of 2007 — with astonishment and delight.“Wow, it’s incredible,’’ said Marilee Jones, the dean of admissions at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, which has a nonbinding early admissions program.Ms. Jones has spoken widely about reducing the pressure and stress of admissions. “It has the capacity to change a lot of things in this business,’’ she said. “It’s bold enough for other schools to really reconsider what they’re doing. I wish them so much luck in this.’’Lloyd Thacker, the executive director of the Education Conservancy, a nonprofit group created to lobby for an overhaul in admissions procedures, said his eyes had teared up when he heard the news. “I’m so glad,” Mr.Thacker said. “I can’t believe it.’’“The most powerful institution in the country is saying, singularly, yes, something is wrong with this and we’re going to try to act in the public interest,’’ he added.The University of Delaware announced a similar move last May.For three decades Harvard has offered a particular form of early admissions, in which students who are accepted early still have the freedom to go elsewhere. Various forms of early admissions are offered by hundreds of colleges and universities, with many requiring applicants to commit upfront to attending the university if offered early admission.The popularity of the procedure grew significantly in the 1990’s, as colleges tried to increase their competitive advantage by locking in strong candidates early. It also gave an edge to students willing to commit early to an institution. In some cases admissions rates are two or three times higher for students who apply early.But at Harvard and many other universities officials have grown concerned that early admissions present a major obstacle to low-income and working-class students. Such students have also been hurt by steep tuition increases and competition with students from wealthy families who pour thousands of dollars into college consultants and tutoring.“I think there are lots of very talented students out there from poor and moderate-income backgrounds who have been discouraged by this whole hocus-pocus of early admissions by many of the nation’s top colleges,’’ said William R. Fitzsimmons, Harvard College’s dean of admissions and financial aid.Mr. Thacker and other critics said that under binding early admission programs, students have to commit to a college long before they know how much aid they will be offered. Students who apply for admission in the regular cycle are able to compare financial-aid offerings from various colleges before making up their minds in April.Under Harvard’s early admissions program, which is known as early action, students do not have to decide until May 1 whether to accept an admission offer. Even so, many potential applicants did not understand the distinction between Harvard’s program and those that require an upfront commitment and were discouraged from applying, Mr. Bok said.“We think the more schools abandon this process, the healthier the admissions process will be,’’ he said.Of the 2,124 students admitted by Harvard last year, 813 were granted early admission, or 38 percent, Mr. Fitzsimmons said.Under Lawrence H. Summers, the Harvard president who left office in June, the university took a number of steps to make itself more accessible to poor and working-class students. Among other things, families with incomes below $60,000 a year are no longer required to pay for a students’ education.The idea of abandoning early admission was developed after Mr. Bok became interim president in July, said John Longbrake, a Harvard spokesman. Early admission will remain in effect in the current academic year, which is already under way.Several educators said only a university with Harvard’s reputation could take the risk involved with eliminating early admission because it will continue to be the first choice for so many top students.“The one thing that always seemed commonly agreed was that no college could give up its early application program if the others didn’t, too,” said Christopher Avery, a Harvard professor and a co-author of “The Early Admissions Game: Joining the Elite” (Harvard University Press, 2003). “This seems to move to do just that.’’Bruce Hunter, director of college counseling at the Rowland Hall-St. Mark’s School, a private school in Salt Lake City, said he hoped other universities would follow Harvard’s lead, but he was not confident they would.“I think that Harvard has calculated that they will not suffer any competitive disadvantage in the process,’’ Mr. Hunter said. “I’m not sure that there are more than a handful of other places that could make the same claim.’’Janet Lavin Rapelye, dean of admission at Princeton University, applauded Harvard’s decision, but said she could not predict how Princeton might respond. Princeton has binding early admission, and Ms. Rapelye said there had been questions about whether early admissions limited diversity.“All of us who sit in these seats have always worried about that,’’ she said. “Yet we have worked very hard to broaden and deepen our applicant pool at every step in the process.’’'"
"'06-09-12,'1','But his next two opponents — Nikolay Davydenko in the semifinals and Roddick in the final — did not get the message or the benefit, and now Federer can relax and enjoy the rest of the season. His victory here clinched the year-end No. 1 ranking for the third consecutive season, and there are still more than two months of tennis remaining.While men like Roddick search for answers by hiring consultants like Jimmy Connors, Federer sticks with his part-time arrangement with Tony Roche, who did not even come to New York. “I spoke to him once,” Federer said. “Before the Blake match.”Federer remains poetry in motion, but his tennis always seems to lead to math. He is now an astonishing 9-1 in Grand Slam finals. His only loss came against Rafael Nadal in this year’s French Open. He is also the first man to win Wimbledon and the United States Open in the same season for three consecutive years.His singles record this year is 70-5, and he has reached the final in 12 of the 13 tournaments he has played.“I’m amazed that every year I somehow make it happen that I take a step forward,” Federer said. “In ’04, I thought it was impossible to top that year with the three Slams and everything, and I came back in ’05 and hardly lost a match. And in ’06, I make a combination of both.”What he did not quite manage was to join Rod Laver and Don Budge as the only men to complete the Grand Slam. His loss to Nadal in four sets in Paris ended that possibility in June, even though he won the other three major titles.“I knew I had an opportunity, but it’s so far-fetched that you don’t want to put yourself under pressure,” Federer said of winning all four majors in one season. “I’m never going to say openly I’m going to go for the Grand Slam.”It was an Open that was more about the past than the present, with Agassi and Navratilova drawing the curtain. Agassi’s farewell generated the much greater commotion and emotion, in part because he was competing in singles, not doubles, and in part because he had never said farewell before.Navratilova retired from singles after the 1994 season, receiving a Harley-Davidson motorcycle in Madison Square Garden. But she returned to the WTA Tour in 2001 as a doubles player and even returned to the French Open and Wimbledon in 2004 as a singles player. At one stage, she declared that year as her final season, but changed her mind.This time, at age 49, she is adamant that there will be no more comebacks, and it would be difficult for her to script a better final act. She won her 59th Grand Slam title Saturday night, playing mixed doubles with Bob Bryan.“I could keep going; I could play another five years, physically there’s no question about it,” Navratilova said. “I could play beyond the legal speed limit in most places. But I don’t want to, you know. I mean, I’ve had enough, and it’s time to move on and do other things.”According to Perry Rogers, Agassi’s manager and friend, Agassi is retired but hardly inactive as he plans for his annual October charity fund-raiser in Las Vegas.But one week after he played his last match against Benjamin Becker here in the third round, Agassi’s back is still reminding him why, at age 36, it was time to stop.“Physically, he’s O.K., not great,” Rogers said. “When I went to lunch with him the day after the Open, he had a tough time getting down a flight of stairs at the hotel. Now, the good thing is he’s not limping.”'"
"'06-09-12,'1','The exact value of the potential break on federal payments will depend both on the price of oil and how much of it comes from the two leases. At $70 a barrel, the Chevron group could save about $1.5 billion in royalties if the government agreed that both leases were contributing to Chevron’s production.But the actual savings would be much lower if oil prices slumped to $40 a barrel. And the savings would disappear if the government insisted that none of Chevron’s output was coming from the two leases, but from the four not eligible for the break.A spokesman for Chevron, Don Campbell, said Monday that “any conjecture about forgone royalties” would be “pure speculation and an academic exercise.”The Chevron leases are the biggest, but hardly the only leases that allow oil companies to avoid royalties regardless of how high energy prices climb.Even before Chevron and its partners confirmed the discovery last week, the Government Accountability Office, the investigative arm of Congress, had estimated that the Treasury could lose as much as $20 billion over the next 25 years.On Wednesday, the House Committee on Government Reform will begin two days of hearings on how the original calculation came to be. Republicans have been eager to blame the Clinton administration, which was in office when the leases were signed.But the Interior Department’s inspector general is expected to testify that the Bush administration may be in danger of making exactly the same move on new leases.According to Congressional aides, the inspector general has uncovered evidence that midlevel Interior Department officials warned as recently as July that a new batch of leases could cost the government billions of dollars beyond the original misstep.Republican lawmakers are also angry about the Interior Department’s response to the problem, which was first disclosed by The New York Times in March.Representative Thomas M. Davis III of Virginia, chairman of the Committee on Government Reform, complained of “systematic delays” and said the Interior Department had withheld large volumes of “critical information” from Congressional investigators.Chevron’s huge potential savings highlight a dispute about how to remedy the leases signed in the late 1990’s. The Bush administration and many Republican leaders argue that those leases are binding contracts that cannot be changed except through an agreement by the companies.Democrats acknowledge that the contracts are binding, but support a measure that would punish companies that refuse to renegotiate their contracts by prohibiting them from acquiring additional oil and gas leases.The House passed the Democratic proposal, over objections from Republican leaders, as an amendment to the Interior Department’s spending bill. The Senate Appropriations Committee attached a similar measure to its bill, but the overall measure has been stalled for months.The hearings this week are expected to focus on how the Interior Department blundered on the leases. The inspector general, Earl E. Devaney, has concluded that the leases were a mistake rather than a result of any collusion with industry.But Mr. Devaney is also expected to say that the Interior Department continues to suffer from a “lack of accountability.” Investigators have combed through 5,000 e-mail messages and are believed to have found some written as recently as this summer in which frustrated midlevel officials warned that the Interior Department had not fixed the bureaucratic and procedural problems that led to the original mistake.Representative Davis and Representative Darrell Issa, Republican of California and chairman of the Government Reform energy and resources subcommittee, accused the Interior Department in August of deliberately obstructing their investigation.“We are deeply concerned that the department may have intentionally withheld critical information from the subcommittee,” the two lawmakers wrote in a letter on Aug. 3 to Dirk Kempthorne, the new Interior secretary. “If this is the case, then it has intentionally impeded this duly authorized Congressional investigation.”'"

"'06-09-12,'1','Facebook, the popular social networking Web site that has mainly focused on college students, is preparing to open its membership to everyone.The move is meant to help the site expand, but it risks undercutting one of its attractions: it has been more exclusive and somewhat more protected than MySpace, its larger and more freewheeling rival.Started two years ago, with Mark Zuckerberg, a Harvard undergraduate, as a co-founder, Facebook first restricted membership to people who had e-mail addresses issued by a college or university. It has expanded somewhat since then, allowing high school students to join (if they are invited by an existing member) along with people who work for certain large companies (if they have a corporate e-mail address).Facebook plans to expand its membership within a month. It had planned to open its doors wider today but postponed the decision after new features begun last week provoked protests among members who complained that the changes revealed too much personal information. The site quickly introduced new options that allowed users to control how information about them is displayed.Facebook members create pages that often contain their telephone numbers, photographs, personal musings and comments left by friends. Unlike MySpace, which displays a member’s page to any other member, Facebook shows the full profile only to a user’s friends and to others in his or her “network” — a school or sometimes an employer. Others can see only limited information about a user.'"
"'06-09-12,'1','SAN FRANCISCO, Sept. 11 — Dell, the world’s largest computer maker, said on Monday that it was delaying the filing of its second-quarter financial report as it works to cooperate with a widening investigation into its accounting practices.The company said that the United States attorney for the Southern District of New York had begun an investigation into Dell’s accounting and that documents related to its financial reporting from 2002 to the present had been subpoenaed.That news came after Dell executives revealed last month that the Securities and Exchange Commission had informed the company a year earlier that it was conducting an informal investigation into the timing of Dell’s revenue booking.Dell also said on Monday that it was suspending its share buyback program, and it postponed an annual meeting of financial analysts scheduled for Wednesday.News of the wider investigation could hardly have come at a worse time for Dell, which is struggling to maintain its share of the computer market while it recovers from a series of missteps and its second consecutive quarter of weak results. Most notably, the company announced the largest recall in the history of consumer electronics last month after it discovered that Sony batteries used in millions of its notebook computers could catch fire.'"
"'06-09-12,'1','Neither Mr. Dolan nor James D. Robinson III, the chairman of Bristol-Myers’s board, could immediately be reached for comment. Tony Plorohos, a spokesman for the Bristol-Myers, said the company would not comment last night.Mr. Dolan, 50, would become the third chief executive of a major pharmaceutical company to leave ahead of schedule in the last 18 months.In July, Pfizer’s board abruptly replaced Hank McKinnell as chief executive amid shareholder disappointment and questions about Mr. McKinnell’s management style.In May 2005, Merck forced Raymond V. Gilmartin, its chairman and chief executive, to resign. Mr. Gilmartin was forced out in part because of Merck’s problems with Vioxx, a painkiller that Merck stopped selling in 2004 after it was linked to heart attacks and strokes.Mr. Lacey’s recommendation about Mr. Dolan stems from Bristol-Myers’s conduct this year in a patent dispute involving its blockbuster anti-clotting agent Plavix, according to the person who attended the meeting.Under the terms of the federal agreement in the accounting scandal, the company was obliged to demonstrate good conduct and improve its corporate governance and remain under supervision by Mr. Lacey at least through the end of this year. In the overseer’s view, Bristol-Myers has evidently breached a portion of the agreement by its handling of efforts, along with its marketing partner Sanofi-Aventis, to settle the Plavix dispute with a Canadian generic drug maker.The Justice Department is thought to be investigating claims that Bristol-Myers tried to conceal portions of a proposed agreement to settle its patent dispute with the Canadian company, Apotex, hiding those details from the Federal Trade Commission and state attorneys general who were reviewing its antitrust implications.Mr. Lacey also recommended that the board fire Richard K. Willard, who was hired as general counsel last October. Mr. Williard’s role in the Plavix case is not publicly known, but it would have been his job to approve the Apotex agreement.Even before last evening’s recommendation, Mr. Dolan’s employment status was uncertain before a regularly scheduled board meeting to be held today.Whatever the merits of the wrongdoing allegations, the court record in the patent case has shown that Bristol-Myers did make significant concessions during the settlement negotiations that paved the way last month for Apotex to flood the market with millions of dollars worth of a cheaper, generic version of Plavix.Under those concessions, Bristol-Myers and Sanofi waived their right under federal law to seek triple financial damages if Apotex began selling its generic drug. And they agreed to give Apotex a five-day head start once it started selling the generic, before they would try to block those sales in court.Those concessions were made as the parties negotiated a settlement under which the Canadian company would agree not to introduce its Plavix competitor until 2011, shortly before the patent is set to expire. Only if regulators refused to accept that agreement were the concessions to take effect.People involved in Bristol-Myers’s negotiations in the patent settlement have since said that the company made the concessions only as an inducement to Apotex to reach an agreement, which they had expected regulators to approve.But Mr. Sherman of Apotex has said he entered the negotiations only to win those concessions, because he did not think the government would approve the settlement deal. When regulators did reject the deal, Apotex almost immediately began shipping its generic Plavix competitor.Federal District Judge Sidney H. Stein, who is overseeing the patent dispute, ordered Apotex to suspend the shipments on Aug. 31. But the volume of the generic drug already on the market has forced Mr. Dolan’s company to reduce its earnings forecast for the year by as much as 25 percent. Plavix is Bristol-Myers’s top-selling drug, with sales last year of $3.5 billion.Financial analysts had been speculating that the Bristol-Myers directors were under pressure to act.Earlier yesterday, a Morgan Stanley analyst, Jami Rubin, said that she believed there was a significant chance Mr. Dolan’s tenure at Bristol-Myers would be over.“The decision to settle with Apotex backfired on the company,” Ms. Rubin said. “Just given the pressure on most boards of directors today, they’ve got to act. And I think that the credibility of management has been put into question. I think that means the board of directors will consider whether they want to keep him. I think there is clearly a risk.”Some individual investors had also complained. Dundas I. Flaherty of Malibu, Calif., has seen his 152,000 shares shrink to a third of their peak value. And he blamed Mr. Dolan for many of the company’s problems.The company’s stock, which closed yesterday at $23.67, is off more than 10 percent from the period before Apotex began shipping its generic drug and nearly 60 percent since Mr. Dolan became chief executive in 2001.Mr. Flaherty wrote Mr. Robinson a letter Aug. 9, the day after Apotex announced it would begin shipping its generic version of Plavix.“I think the right thing to do is show him the door,” Mr. Flaherty said yesterday, referring to Mr. Dolan.Responding to the Justice Department investigation, which included a search on July 26 of Mr. Dolan’s Park Avenue office, Bristol-Myers has been saying that neither Mr. Dolan nor any other company official did anything illegal. In court, a lawyer for Sanofi-Aventis and Bristol-Myers argued that the allegations were contrived by Bernard C. Sherman, Apotex’s chief executive, in pursuit of his goal to get the generic Plavix on the market.Bristol-Myers’s reduced earnings estimate of 95 cents a share is now below the company’s dividend of $1.12, meaning that the company would pay out more to investors in dividends than it makes. Still, Mr. Dolan and other company executives have recently been assuring investors that the dividend is safe for now.While no clear candidate emerged yesterday for Mr. Dolan’s job, the board’s options if he left would include installing an interim chief from among current executives or name a caretaker chief from the board.Mr. Dolan was named chief executive on May 1, 2001, after having served in managerial roles with the company since 1988. His tenure has been marked by a series of difficulties, some that Mr. Dolan said he inherited and others that appeared to be of his own making.During his tenure, Bristol-Myers has faced the failure of two major experimental products: the blood pressure medication Vanlev and the diabetes drug Pargluva, both abandoned after it became clear they would not be approved by the Food and Drug Administration.And investors raised questions about other decisions by Mr. Dolan, like his purchase for $2 billion of a 19 percent stake in ImClone, the company that makes the cancer drug Erbitux. Although Erbitux is on the market and considered successful, there have been complaints that Bristol-Myers paid too much for its share.Yet Mr. Dolan claimed he inherited the major stain on his legacy — the $2.5 billion accounting scandal involving accusations that Bristol-Myers was providing incentives to wholesalers to buy excess inventory. The practice, called channel stuffing, was the subject of a Justice Department investigation that ended last year with the deferred-prosecution agreement.Under that agreement, Mr. Dolan was forced to relinquish his title as chairman but was allowed to retain his chief executive’s job, subject to the discretion of Mr. Lacey.While some analysts, citing the company’s intriguing pipeline of new products, had recently said they believed that Mr. Dolan was turning the company around, the Plavix debacle led many of them to conclude that Bristol-Myers had been outmaneuvered by Apotex.'"
"'06-09-12,'1','There are no immediate theories, the person said, as to who is responsible for the breach, first reported by The San Francisco Chronicle.The governor’s legal affairs secretary, Andrea Lynn Hoch, issued a statement Monday night saying that an internal audit had revealed some information about the person involved in the breach and that the information had been turned over to the Highway Patrol.In remarks to Ms. Kennedy and Gary Delsohn, a speechwriter, Mr. Schwarzenegger praised the legislative style of State Senator Bonnie Garcia, who is of Puerto Rican descent, saying: “I mean Cuban, Puerto Rican, they are all very hot. They have the, you know, part of the black blood in them and part of the Latino blood in them that together makes it.”On Friday, Ms. Garcia held a joint news conference with Mr. Schwarzenegger in Los Angeles to announce that his remarks had not bothered her in the least, but the governor said that reading the remarks in the newspaper made him “cringe.”Mr. Delsohn records conversations with the governor to use as reference material when he is writing his speeches, but shares them with a limited number of sources, The Chronicle reported.Some experts on computer security said the person or people who entered the governor’s system most likely knew what they were looking for — rather than randomly stumbling across the files — and could have easily stolen the password needed to get them. They said it was likely that the files were not properly secured.Sondra Schneider, the chief executive of Security University, a company that provides training in protecting electronic assets, theorized that someone sent an e-mail message that compromised the governor’s computer system when it was opened, allowing the sender to steal the password.“Anyone at any time of any day can do that to anyone,” Ms. Schneider said. “It happens every minute of the day.”In the case of the governor’s office, Ms. Schneider said: “They just had to know that those audio files were in existence. I don’t think someone was fishing around on the site looking for it. They knew it was there and it was made available because it was not secured properly.”The governor’s press office referred all calls to the California Highway Patrol. David Garcia, a spokesman for The Los Angeles Times, said in an e-mail message that the paper had not been contacted by the patrol.Governor Schwarzenegger is in a tough re-election battle. He has been known to get into hot water with his remarks, including once calling a group of legislators “girlie men.”'"
"'06-09-12,'1','CHICAGO, Sept. 11 — In his 17 years at this city’s helm, Mayor Richard M. Daley had never vetoed a decision of the City Council, a sign, it seems, that he gets his way most of the time.But on Monday, Mr. Daley vetoed the Council’s plan to make Chicago the first city in the nation to single out “big box” retailers like Wal-Mart and Home Depot for wage minimums for their workers.“I understand and share a desire to ensure that everyone who works in the city of Chicago earns a decent wage,” Mr. Daley wrote of the rules, which would have required large stores to pay at least $10 an hour by 2010, and at least $3 an hour in benefits.“But I do not believe that this ordinance, well intentioned as it may be, would achieve that end,” he continued. “Rather, I believe it would drive jobs and businesses from our city, penalizing neighborhoods that need additional economic activity the most.”The veto, praised by business leaders but condemned by labor groups and the aldermen who had pressed for the ordinance, set up the mayor for a rare political fight: Mr. Daley, who is up for re-election next year, may face an effort to override his veto at City Hall on Wednesday.'"
"'06-09-12,'1','Investors do not seem to be counting on another bidding war. Shares of Univision closed at $34.85 yesterday, below the price offered by the winning consortium.The main hurdle for any Televisa bid is a United States law that bars foreign companies from owning more than 25 percent of a broadcaster. The Televisa consortium is exploring how to structure a deal in a way that would technically keep the company below that threshold. Lawyers for the consortium have recently sought guidance from regulators, although it is unclear how Televisa could meet the requirement.Another obstacle to a rival offer is contained in Univision’s merger agreement, which calls for it to pay $300 million to the current buying group if the board accepts a higher offer from someone else.Still, some think that Televisa may jump back into the picture. Late last month, a Banc of America Securities analyst, Jonathan Jacoby, wrote that “we still believe that Televisa could make an effort to assemble another bid” and estimated that such a bid would need to be between $38 and $39 a share. He put the odds of a higher Televisa bid at about 40 percent.The struggle for Univision has had as many twists as one of the Spanish-language soap operas, or telenovelas, that are one of its most popular television offerings.When Univision began its sale process, many analysts considered Televisa a top contender to acquire it. The two companies have close business ties, with Televisa providing much of Univision’s programming through a contract that extends through 2017. Televisa also owns a minority stake in Univision that gives it the right to elect a board member.To skirt the foreign ownership restriction, Televisa originally teamed up with a group of United States private equity firms that included Bain Capital, the Carlyle Group, the Blackstone Group, Cascade Investments and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Company.But Televisa hit a setback when Carlyle, Blackstone and Kohlberg Kravis dropped out of the bidding group because of a dispute over the price they were willing to pay.Then Univision rejected as too low offers from both Televisa’s consortium and the one including Mr. Saban, raising the possibility that the entire auction could collapse.The sale was salvaged when Mr. Saban’s group returned with an 11th-hour offer of $36.25 a share, which Univision accepted in late June.Since then, Televisa has seemed reluctant to let the drama end.Soon after losing the auction, Televisa expressed its disappointment in a statement that blamed Univision for shutting it out of deal talks and stated that Televisa had “a number of alternatives it is considering.”In July, Televisa announced its intention to sell its 11.4 percent stake in Univision and suggested that it might start an online programming outlet to rival Univision in the United States. To discuss the fate of that stake, Televisa representatives met with members of the winning consortium in Sun Valley, Idaho, at a media conference held by the investment bank Allen & Company.The Sun Valley talks and subsequent discussions apparently failed to resolve the matter. Univision said in a statement filed with regulators that no agreement on a possible “rollover” of Televisa’s shares had yet been reached.Representatives for Televisa and Univision declined to comment yesterday.'"
"'06-09-12,'1','For instance, rather than collecting $200 each time Go is passed, in the new edition the player collects $2 million. The four railroads on the Monopoly board — B&O, Pennsylvania, Reading and Short Line — will be supplanted by the country’s four busiest airports: Atlanta Hartsfield-Jackson, Kennedy in New York, Los Angeles and O’Hare in Chicago.And the properties of Atlantic City that compose the game board will make way for real estate from Boston and Washington to Las Vegas and Hollywood.“So much of American pop culture today is represented by products that people use every day,” Mark Blecher, senior vice president for marketing at the Hasbro Games unit of Hasbro, said in a telephone interview yesterday.“We thought, let’s try to get iconography that’s much more relevant to people today,” he added.The new tokens are indicative of a marketing trend known as branded entertainment, in which products are woven into the contents of popular culture including the plots of movies, television shows and novels; song lyrics; and video games.Until now, there has been relatively little evidence of commercial trappings in traditional board games like Monopoly. The arrival of such elements worries some experts.“It’s part of the insinuation of the commercial culture into every aspect of our lives,” said Gary Ruskin, executive director at Commercial Alert, a nonprofit organization in Portland, Ore., that seeks to curtail what it deems to be creeping commercialization.The coming of branded tokens “turns Monopoly into a giant advertisement,” Mr. Ruskin said. “It’s a shame Hasbro has chosen to go this low road.”Unlike advertisers that typically pay to be included in branded-entertainment projects, the five marketers whose products are becoming branded tokens did not ask Hasbro to be included in the new edition nor did they pay Hasbro a fee, Mr. Blecher said.Rather, he said, the company sought out the marketers because their products will help the new version offer “a representation of America in the 21st century.”“We’re recasting the entire game as if we were creating it today,” Mr. Blecher said.•For many years, Hasbro has sold special themed versions of Monopoly with the boards, tokens and other contents changed to salute films like “Star Wars,” TV series like “The Simpsons” and sports teams like the Boston Red Sox. For example, the Red Sox edition had tokens shaped like tiny baseball caps.But the themed editions are sold only in limited quantities, Mr. Blecher said, unlike the Here and Now edition, which is intended to be a mainstream product.Although Hasbro does not discuss specific sales figures, Mr. Blecher said, the original version of Monopoly sells “several million copies in the United States every year.” Hasbro expects the new version to also sell millions of copies a year, he added, and expects only “a minor amount of cannibalization” of sales of the vintage version.Monopoly is considered the most popular board game ever, with more than 250 million copies sold.The Here and Now edition will cost about $30, Mr. Blecher said, compared with $12 to $20 for the original edition. A multimillion-dollar advertising campaign to promote the new version is scheduled to begin this week, he added.Marketers chosen by Hasbro to be part of the new edition said they were not worried about perceptions that their inclusion would commercialize the game.“We see a lot of products that are No. 1 in their categories became part of the consumer lexicon and culture,” said Brian O’Mara, senior director for United States marketing at the McDonald’s USA division of the McDonald’s Corporation in Oak Brook, Ill.“Monopoly is one of our customers’ favorite promotions,” Mr. O’Mara said, referring to the many collaborations of McDonald’s and Hasbro on sweepstakes with Monopoly themes, “so we felt this was a natural.”George Neill, corporate vice president for global marketing at Motorola in Schaumburg, Ill., said: “We were just really flattered they thought of us in contemporizing the game and identifying the iconic products of this age. This recognizes what Razr has done for us, and what Motorola can be to people.”Mary Nickerson, national marketing manager for advanced-technology vehicles at Toyota Motor Sales USA in Torrence, Calif., said she welcomed the Prius token because of Monopoly’s status as a game that children and adults often play together.“It’s great from a marketing perspective because it creates an opportunity for conversations to take place in the home about hybrids,” Ms. Nickerson said. “We hope it will encourage more use of hybrid technology.”Of the five branded tokens, the Prius replaces the vintage race car in the original version and the New Balance sneaker replaces the shoe. The other three branded tokens do not directly replace any original tokens.The three new tokens that are unbranded are: a jet, which replaces the battleship; a Labradoodle, which replaces the Scottish terrier; and a laptop computer, which does not directly replace an original token.Hasbro chose not to brand all the new tokens, Mr. Blecher said, to minimize concerns that the new edition would be too commercialized.•The new properties in the Here and Now edition were chosen by consumers who voted online last spring as part of a promotion Hasbro sponsored. More than three million votes were submitted, Mr. Blecher said. There will be 22 cities represented in the new version, compared with just one, Atlantic City, in the original.Over the years, Hasbro has changed some aspects of the original version. For example, the character of the wealthy well-dressed gentleman who personifies the Monopoly game was long known as Rich Uncle Penny Bags. He is now referred to in the game as Mr. Monopoly.The campaign to promote the Here and Now edition will include TV, print and outdoor ads by Grey Worldwide in New York, part of the Grey Global Group unit of the WPP Group. Online ads are being created by Tribal DDB, part of the DDB Worldwide division of the Omnicom Group.The branded tokens are “the latest version of that, things people think are representative of today,” said Tim Mellors, president and chief creative officer at Grey North America. “A Starbucks coffee cup is more relevant than an iron.”'"
"'06-09-12,'1','The Campbell Soup Company, pressured by expenses from the sale of businesses in Britain and Ireland, posted a lower quarterly profit yesterday and forecast that earnings for its current fiscal year would be below analyst estimates.The company, whose products include soup, Godiva chocolate and Pepperidge Farm cookies, said profit fell to $44 million, or 11 cents a share, from $96 million, or 23 cents a share, a year earlier.Excluding one-time items, earnings were 18 cents a share, compared with the 21 cents a share expected by Wall Street analysts.Campbell sold its British and Irish soup and flour businesses to Premier Foods of Britain during the quarter and recorded expenses of 15 cents a share.Sales in the period, which ended July 30 and which was the fourth quarter of Campbell’s fiscal year, rose about 4 percent, to $1.45 billion, from $1.40 billion.'"
"'06-09-12,'1','Indeed, OPEC is now shifting its attention to a problem it had managed to avoid for much of the last year — how much should oil prices be allowed to drop before the oil-producing group steps in?Some oil ministers have suggested that OPEC may need to cut its output before the end of the year. Many ministers fear being caught short by a sudden price drop that they would fail to counterbalance.Agreeing on a floor price is not going to be an easy matter, analysts said. Since opening its spigots last year to meet surging oil demand and stabilize prices, OPEC ministers have become increasingly comfortable with oil prices that have been significantly higher than in the past.Now they must grapple with the possibility that the three-year price run may be coming to an end, Deciding what would be a “reasonable” new floor to defend will be tricky.“We will know it when we see it, that’s what we mean when we say reasonable prices,” Edmund Daukoru, Nigeria’s oil minister and the OPEC president this year, said at a news conference after the meeting ended.He repeatedly declined to say at what price level OPEC would be compelled to act.“It’s a feel,” he said at one point. “It’s a feel thing. I cannot put a number.”While OPEC producers have been pumping at their highest level since 1979, partly to help drive prices down, geopolitical tensions in the Middle East and the threat of another severe hurricane season in the Gulf of Mexico have kept oil markets on edge.But the hurricane season has so far proved benign, the United Nations has not moved to sanction Iran over its nuclear enrichment program, and the war in the Middle East this summer has ended without escalating into a wider regional conflict. These factors helped push prices down in recent weeks. In addition, the American economy seems to be softening.Light, sweet crude oil for October delivery closed at $65.61 a barrel, after falling more than $1 earlier in the day on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Oil has dropped by more than $11 a barrel in the last month after hitting a new high of $77.03 at the beginning of hostilities between Israel and Lebanon in July.Members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, who account for about 40 percent of global oil exports, are next scheduled to meet in mid-December in Nigeria.Some OPEC delegates said they might need to meet earlier if prices kept falling. A production cut may be on the table at the next meeting, according to two oil ministers, Abdullah bin Hamad al-Attiyah from Qatar and Rafael Ramírez from Venezuela. Kazem Vaziri Hamaneh, Iran’s oil minister, said oil prices should not be allowed to fall below $60 a barrel.Chakib Khelil, Algeria’s oil minister, said, “There is no need to cut now but if there is a deterioration in the global economy and prices fall quickly, then we will need a meeting before December.”Yasser Elguindi, a senior managing director at Medley Global Advisers, an advisory firm for hedge funds, said, “Prices are still high and OPEC wants them to come down. But it is good for them to start looking at their supplies.”OPEC’s output quota will remain at 28 million barrels a day for the time being. Including Iraq, which is not bound by the quota system, the daily production of the 11-member cartel is about 30 million barrels.Not everyone is concerned by the drop in prices — at least so far.“Don’t take this blip as significant,” Ali al-Naimi, Saudi Arabia’s oil minister, told reporters in Vienna. “This is a cyclical business. It’s not the first time prices go up or prices go down.”“Market fundamentals are very sound,” Mr. Naimi said. “We are beginning to see a slight decrease in economic growth, very slight.” But, he added, “It is nothing alarming.”'"
"'06-09-12,'1','Masada is not a band, but a meaty family tree of compositions by John Zorn, drawing on Jewish folk music. He wrote the roughly 500 short pieces in two enormous clumps over about 10 years, and distributed them to different musicians and ensembles.The 200 or so Masada pieces in the first book were written by Mr. Zorn in the mid-1990’s. He completed nearly 300 more in 2004. On Sunday night at the 92nd Street Y, on the first night of the weeklong oy!hoo festival — also known as the New York Jewish Music and Heritage Festival — Mr. Zorn presided over four different ensembles playing music mostly from the second clump of Masada music, which he calls the Book of Angels.As a composer, Mr. Zorn tends to construct a limited, well-defined musical language; conceives a record; hammers it out; then envisions volume 2. He is an artist of speed-completion. It is no surprise that many pieces sound similar or divide neatly into types. There is the elegiac Masada piece, restful and droning. There is the type with a kind of swing, a folk dance feeling, a clear melody. And there is the fragmented piece, calling on fast reflexes, cueing from the composer, and the comedy of sound and body. The three types are like three interconnected families; in Sunday’s show, one became familiar with them in different costumes — jazz, classical and rock.The program began with Mr. Zorn’s classical piece called “Kol Nidre,” which was not written as part of the Masada books but was composed while he was working on them. It was initially recorded with a string quartet, but here it was expanded to a small orchestra. A gang of concert musicians sat down; cellos and violins played an unending pedal tone; the violas draped a sad, surging melody across it. It lasted less than 10 minutes, and the musicians filed off: a feat of organization and concision.Then came the Masada Quartet, which has achieved a special identity in jazz terms, even beyond the binding logic of the compositions. With Mr. Zorn on alto saxophone, Dave Douglas on trumpet, Greg Cohen on bass and Joey Baron on drums, the group played as well as ever, compressing early-60’s free jazz into tight boxes, with the usual equal measures of compositional clarity and pure sound graffiti.Mr. Zorn, a multitasking stage presence wound so tightly that he looked ready to snap, played a harmonically free, bop-rhythm, Eric Dolphy-like solo in one of the set’s best pieces; even at his most involved, he was still cueing accents from Mr. Baron with his right hand.'"
"'06-09-12,'1','In her latest art pieces Ms. Saar continues the trajectory of her ancestral narratives to bring them, like their creator, full circle.“My work before was mostly in the United States — the Aunt Jemima thing, the derogatory images,” she said. Her latest artwork traverses black history from “what happened in Africa, the transition through the diaspora, to slavery, to freedom,” she added. “This new work is about the integration of it all.”The 17 assemblages at the Rosenfeld gallery, some of which she will discuss tomorrow night, tell of journeys literal and spiritual. In “Ragtime,” a photograph of a minstrel strumming a banjo shares space with a scrap of a Confederate flag, an African mask, the layout of a slave ship, a clockface, a lock and a chain. At the bottom, block letters spell out R-A-G-T-I-M-E.“It’s about the African-American who gets to be a minstrel or a fool or gets lynched,” Ms. Saar said. “The R is backwards, and the G is backwards, but so is slavery.”In “Vessels,” cutouts of the moon frame a portrait of a woman in a lace blouse, surrounded by amber-glass bottles.“Her face is so beautiful and peaceful, but there’s something about the eyes that shows sadness and sorrow, like somehow in her DNA she remembers the slave ship,” Ms. Saar said. The bottles “are the poison of the idea of using rum to buy more slaves, and then the slaves would produce the sugar that would make more rum.”“Cage (In the Beginning)” resembles a tower of cells in which African tourist sculptures, in shackled or hanging positions, have been strung. The work refers to the transition from tribal member to slave, Ms. Saar said, and was inspired by a trip she made to the holding dungeons on an island off Nigeria.“I’m a sensitive person to places and situations, and I walked into a room, and it was really oppressive,” she said. “It didn’t feel comfortable, and I tried to capture that.”Ms. Saar, who is of African, Irish and American Indian ancestry, deals with discomfort by focusing on stereotypical images and language and not allowing her audience to turn away. Not all of her visual lectures point outward: “Colored: Consider the Rainbow” (2002), for example, consists of 29 works that explore the issues of skin color within the black culture.Born in Los Angeles in 1926, Betye Brown graduated from the University of California, Los Angeles, and was a social worker before marrying the conservator and painter Richard Saar, who was white. Their daughters Lezley and Alison are also artists; a third, Tracye, is a writer.After divorcing, Ms. Saar worked as a costume designer. It was then that she began concocting assemblages of found materials, inspired by Joseph Cornell’s boxes.Her art evokes a sense of memory, ancestry and journeys common across cultures and gender, and tries to speak of the unspeakable in ways words cannot.Ms. Saar is an artist “who gets a lot of materials sent to her, and she does use them,” said Halley K. Harrisburg, a director of the Rosenfeld gallery. “She’ll use memories from other people. She takes it in, and when it’s time to create a work, she has embraced it in a way that it no longer has that specific association and now just has a deeper, richer meaning in another context.’’Deborah Willis, a professor of photography at New York University, said: “I see her work as reflective of the rites of passages that many of us have gone through — courtships, growing up with grandmothers and aunts. She portrays women as warriors, and I think that is essential in her relationship to younger artists, who have turned to Betye in their attempt to understand that history of struggle and survival and resilience.”Ms. Saar, too, speaks of broken chains. “There are more years behind me than in front of me, but there’s a sense of freedom,” she said. “I’m shifting into cruise control and I’m coasting along, and it’s just wonderful.”'"
"'06-09-12,'1','In the 1930’s, the kouprey trotted like a revelation out of the forests of central Indochina and into the world of modern science. Here, after all, was a large wild ox with the speed and grace of a deer and an impressive set of horns, yet it had been hiding in plain view, having never been officially discovered by science.But now, just 70 years after the first captive kouprey was sent to France from Cambodia for study, the last species of wild Asian cattle to become known scientifically may become the first to vanish in modern times — and not necessarily through extinction. Rather, three biologists from Northwestern University and the Cambodian Forestry Administration have proposed a taxonomic demotion. In a paper published online in July by The Journal of Zoology, they say the kouprey (koh-PRAY) is probably a domestic hybrid that became feral, a zoological poseur, not a valid species.The biologists’ proposal has met stiff opposition within the small group of scientists who study Asian wild cattle. Several say the paper misinterpreted the genetics and history of the kouprey, which may still exist in domesticated form. Although rare, elusive and enigmatic, kouprey are recognizable enough, longer-legged, more graceful, faster and slightly larger than the closely related banteng, and slightly smaller than the gaur, the largest of the wild cattle.Kouprey bulls stand just over six feet tall and weigh up to 1,800 pounds, with a humpback, a dewlap — the loose fold of skin dangling from the neck — that can drag the ground and elaborate curved horns. Females are about three-quarters the size of males, have little or no dewlap, and their horns spiral at the ends. Kouprey are probably extinct in the wild, victims of overhunting, war and habitat loss. There have been no confirmed sightings in more than 20 years, and even unconfirmed sightings have been rare since the 1990’s. There are no kouprey in any of the world’s zoos.But if the kouprey is not a species, then the word “extinction” does not have its usual meaning. Or as Gary J. Galbreath, the lead author of the paper, put it in an e-mail message, “It is pleasant to realize that humans have probably not, after all, caused the extinction of a species in this case.”In their Journal of Zoology paper, Dr. Galbreath and his colleagues say the kouprey most likely originated as a cross between two domesticated species, the banteng and the zebu. Dr. Galbreath said in an interview that the animal might have become wild in the 19th century as a result of the societal disruption that followed an invasion of Cambodia by Thailand, then called Siam. Although the kouprey reproduced in the wild, they were in decline almost from the moment of their escape from domesticity.'"
"'06-09-12,'1','Interns working the arduous shifts common in their training are more likely to stick themselves accidentally with needles and other medical equipment, new research has found.Researchers had already established that the exhaustion that comes with being on call for 24 hours or more leads to problems away from the hospital, like car accidents. But this study suggests that doctors may also be in some danger at work, since needle sticks can expose medical workers to H.I.V. and hepatitis.The study, published in the current Journal of the American Medical Association, was led by Dr. Najib T. Ayas of the Harvard affiliate Brigham and Women’s Hospital. The findings were based on a survey of more than 2,700 doctors in the first year of their internship. Each month, the doctors reported information about their work schedules and whether they had been exposed to any potentially contaminated body fluids.In all, more than 1,500 interns reported having been exposed. Of these incidents, about 500 involved needles, scalpels or other sharp objects. The most common factors leading to accidents cited by the interns were fatigue or a lapse in concentration.But when the researchers looked at the timing of the incidents, they found that accidents were much more likely to happen when the interns were working extended shifts and when they were working at night. The study said hospitals should take fatigue into account in coming up with safety programs.'"
"'06-09-12,'1','The product is an example of many small-business applications that fly under the radar, widely unknown to larger businesses. Limited budgets and other priorities mean that a large variety of products do not receive enough attention.Such products come from both small firms and multinational corporations. Few businesses are aware, for example, of Microsoft’s Business Contact Manager, which is bundled with the company’s Office Small Business Management Edition 2006.Business Contact Manager is “a lightweight customer relationship management system,” said Cindy Bates, general manager of Microsoft’s United States Small Business Unit. As a module within Outlook, the program helps businesses track the amount of time salespeople visit customers, apprise users of sales leads and turn orders into invoices.Another Microsoft product, Office Live, makes it easy to prepare a multipage Web site, automatically register and renew a domain name, receive e-mail messages using that name and host the site, all at no cost. (Office Live Essentials, with more features, costs $30 a month.)Last month, Google introduced Google Apps for Your Domain, a group of free Web-based services like e-mail and instant messaging as well as tools that allow small businesses to maintain their own Web sites with their own domain name without paying an Internet service provider or maintaining their own servers.And as both Office Live and Google Apps are Web-based, the services’ tools work with any operating system.Paul Gryfakis, who owns Parking Padding Solutions, a two-person operation in Chicago that makes pads to protect cars from parking-lot posts, did not like his Web site, so he turned to Office Live’s tools.“It was free, so I had nothing to lose,” Mr. Gryfakis said. He used the templates to make a new version in days. Mr. Gryfakis says the site has not increased his business but has improved his ranking on some search engines. “My site hits have definitely increased,” he said.Ramon Ray, the publisher of smallbiztechnology.com, said he thought that small businesses should consider creating their own blogs. “Blogging gets you higher up in the Web rankings,” Mr. Ray said. “And blogging gives you a huge resource of information to put on your Web site.”To simplify the blogging process, consider free tools at blogger.com (which is owned by Google) or at wordpress.com. Another Web site, Typepad.com, charges $5 a month for a single user; it provides enhanced tools to help create the blog, add pictures and manage messages.While Microsoft Office is the standard product for creating documents, slide shows and spreadsheets, some no-cost alternatives can create documents compatible with Word, Excel and PowerPoint.With Web-based software, available at sites like Thinkoffice.org and Zoho.com, users can grant access to others to read and change a file, without having to e-mail the document or keep track of the latest version. Files are kept at the company’s servers rather than on the user’s PC. And because the products are Web-based, they can be accessed using any operating system, but not necessarily any Web browser.Ms. Gordon, the handbag designer, said she was thrilled with the results she got from the Constant Contact newsletter mailing. Each time a newsletter is sent, she notices a rise in sales and Web site visits. “For $15, you’ve got to be kidding me,” she said.'"
"'06-09-12,'1','This is one of the odder consequences of the terrorist attacks.It is O.K. on Sept. 11 to sell symbols of vanity like clothes and jewelry. It is fine to trade stocks, and play baseball, and broadcast soap operas and even write a newspaper column. But absolutely forbidden is the normal functioning of our democracy.And they say the terrorists haven’t won.However imperfect they may be, politicians are an embodiment of American democracy and one of its treasures: the right to vote. But if they dare to engage voters on Sept. 11, or really do much of anything beyond attending memorial services, they risk bringing wrath upon their heads.Fernando Ferrer learned that on Sept. 11 last year when, with two days to go to the Democratic mayoral primary, he accepted the Rev. Al Sharpton’s endorsement. Some politicians and relatives of those killed at the trade center treated Mr. Ferrer as if he were a flag burner. Words like “completely wrong,” “shocking” and “inappropriate” filled the air.Mind you, Mr. Ferrer had made no attempt to exploit the terror attacks, unlike some politicians in this state and elsewhere in the country whose commercials have included shots of the burning towers. Unlike some, he had not made a fortune or tried to build a political career on the back of the disaster.His perceived sin was simply to have performed a normal democratic function on the anniversary.This notion that democracy cannot proceed as usual on Sept. 11 has been part of the city’s political DNA since that dreadful day itself.YOU no doubt remember that it was Primary Day in 2001. Voting was stopped and delayed for two weeks. That, everyone agreed, made sense.Then the situation changed. Some suggested canceling the election outright, on the theory that the city was too traumatized for politics. Never mind that this country did not call off elections under far more stressful circumstances, like the Civil War and World War II.This was followed by proposals that Rudolph W. Giuliani be retained as mayor by any means possible, if not by scrapping a term-limits law that required he leave office then by at least giving him an extra three months. To those making that argument, and they included Mr. Giuliani himself, a basic component of American democracy — the orderly transfer of power, something accomplished through wars and assassinations — seemed no longer to apply.In general, Mr. Giuliani was less than enthusiastic about elections to choose his successor. On Sept. 24, 2001, a day before the rescheduled primary, he urged New Yorkers to vote “if they want to.” These were hardly rousing words, and they certainly fell short of his appeals to people to shop, watch ballgames and take in Broadway shows.In the end, the efforts to keep him in office failed. But a notion had taken root: The familiar mechanisms of democracy are incompatible with 9/11.Not to jump too far ahead, but it may be worth noting that Sept. 11 will fall next year on a Tuesday, as it did in 2001. According to an established pattern, that should be Primary Day. Let’s see what the political class, intimidated as it is in this regard, does about it.'"

"'06-09-13,'1','Andrew M. Cuomo and Jeanine F. Pirro kicked off their general election campaigns for attorney general today, setting the tone for what promises to be a fiery contest.At a news conference, Ms. Pirro, the Republican candidate, challenged Mr. Cuomo to run a “positive, issues-oriented campaign” but then took him on directly. “There is no comparison between our records,” said Ms. Pirro, the former three-term district attorney of Westchester County.Mr. Cuomo, the Democratic candidate, said at his own news conference that he would do his best to stick to the issues. Asked if he would push back if Ms. Pirro attacked, he said, with a laugh, “Do I ever push?”As the general election begins following Tuesday’s rather predictable primaries, all eyes are on the race to replace Eliot Spitzer as attorney general, which features two candidates who are perhaps the most aggressive politicians in their respective political parties.Ms. Pirro, who stepped down as district attorney of Westchester County last year after three terms, said that a career prosecutor such as herself is best suited to continue Mr. Spitzer’s aggressive pursuit of crime and fraud in New York State.“Clearly the biggest issue is the qualifications to be the top lawyer and the chief law enforcement officer of the state of New York,” she said yesterday.'"
"'06-09-13,'1','Interstate 5, one of California’s busiest north-south routes, was partially re-opened today after being shut down Tuesday as a result of a fire that has been burning in remote woodlands northwest of Los Angeles since Labor Day.The fire, fanned by temperatures in the high 90’s and gusting winds, has scorched some 25,000 acres in the Las Padres National Forest, and continues to burn largely uncontrolled. Authorities feared if the blaze jumped over I-5, which passes through the national forest, inhabited areas to the west.Some 1,400 firefighters have been working to contain the fire, with little success. Part of the problem is that there are almost no roads in much of the region, making access difficult. In some cases, firefighters have rappelled down from helicopters on ropes to chop out landing areas for additional helicopters.But since there are no homes or other structures in the immediate area of the fire, authorities have been reluctant to send firefighters there, fearing that they could become trapped if the winds shift.The blaze, in Ventura and Los Angeles Counties, sent plumes of smoke into the air and made visibility difficult on I-5 and nearby highways. Police were escorting groups of vehicles through the smoke on the two northbound and two southbound lanes on I-5.Authorities said the fire apparently was started by someone who burned debris in a remote area. No arrests have been made.'"
"'06-09-13,'1','A Queens State senator who endured a wave of negative press headlines appeared to have narrowly lost her State Senate seat last night in a rare defeat for a legislative incumbent.The longtime incumbent, Ada L. Smith, was running behind Shirley L. Huntley, a first-time candidate who is president of the Community Education Council in District 28 in Queens.With all election precincts reporting in unofficial results, Ms. Huntley had 51 percent of the vote to Senator Smith’s 49 percent. The New York City Board of Elections said it would be several days before it determined how many paper ballots remained to be counted.Ms. Smith has become something of a controversial figure in the Legislature and in her district, which includes parts of southeastern Queens. In 2004, she was convicted of speeding through a security checkpoint at a garage in Albany.After her conviction in the checkpoint episode, State Senator David A. Paterson, the leader of the Democratic minority, stripped her of her party leadership position in the Senate. That same year, a former staff member accused her of directing antigay remarks at him, but the State Division of Human Rights found insufficient evidence to support his claims.

"'06-09-13,'1','Other movie studios were conspicuously absent from the announcement. Some have resisted the idea of offering movies that can be downloaded, fearing the loss of lucrative DVD sales.Apple is a late entrant to the living room market, which is already crowded with digital devices that can play video, like the Xbox and PlayStation game consoles and Microsoft-based Media Center personal computers, along with streaming video gadgets of every shape and function.That appeared not to faze Mr. Jobs, who showed off a simple interface for playing video and music on a TV, patterned on the company’s Front Row software.Mr. Jobs noted that Apple was already in the den with the Macintosh and in the consumer’s pocket and car with the iPod, and was now poised to enter the living room. He said wireless streaming of digital entertainment was the missing piece of the puzzle.“He did what he needed to do,” said Michael Gartenberg, vice president and research director for Jupiter Research. “It puts him way ahead of everyone else” in the effort to extend the PC to the living room.The new streaming device partly sheltered Mr. Jobs from criticism that he had failed to line up support from Hollywood studios in the same way that he won the backing of the music industry when he originally introduced the iTunes store. Mr. Jobs suggested that other studios would join the movie service in the future.Film executives have long been skeptical of Mr. Jobs’s move into the entertainment business, although music and TV executives have embraced the idea. The music industry was in the doldrums when Apple’s store was introduced in 2003, and executives saw it as an answer to the problems it faced with online piracy.Last year, Apple announced that Disney, which owns ABC, would sell “Desperate Housewives” and “Lost” through iTunes, and other TV studios, which were facing their own uncertain digital future, quickly followed suit. On Tuesday Mr. Jobs drew a parallel between the introduction of movies and Apple’s experience with television, where it also started with a single studio and has now been widely embraced.Movie executives, though, are being more cautious in their negotiations. For one, many do not want to undermine their DVD business. And Apple’s concept is not revolutionary; there already are services that offer movies for download, though they have not been popular.A Hollywood executive who declined to be named because of the sensitive nature of the talks with Apple said one reason Mr. Jobs did not have more movie studios lined up for Tuesday’s announcement was that it preceded the highly lucrative holiday season, when DVD sales surge.“Steve’s announcement isn’t about helping us sell movies,” said another Hollywood executive who also declined to be named. “It’s about him trying to sell more iPods.”That said, the studios are open to the idea and are likely to begin selling movies through iTunes perhaps as early as next year, once certain issues can be addressed, several people involved in the negotiations said. Two of those issues are how much Apple will charge and what movies will be available. The studios are willing to sell older movies in their libraries for a cheaper price, but they say $15 for a new title is too low.Apple’s new movies are delivered in a higher-resolution format than the television shows it now sells. The current videos are available in a 320-by-240-pixel format. Mr. Jobs went to great lengths to explain how the new movies and newly added TV content, at 640 by 480 pixels, will offer a substantial increase in visual clarity.The movies will have lower resolution than commercial DVD’s, which are generally formatted at 720 by 480 pixels, however, and will take several hours to download at standard broadband data rates.This could change. During an interview after his presentation, Mr. Jobs said the revolution was being held back by the bottleneck of current Internet download speeds, not by any limitations of the new wireless TV product.Apple also refreshed its industry-dominant line of iPod music and video players. Mr. Jobs noted that the company had maintained a greater than 75 share of the market for digital music players in the United States, and that an iPod-compatible system developed by Nike that measures running speeds and distance had sold 450,000 units in its first 90 days.Apple plans to introduce its fifth generation of hard disk-based iPod music players, priced from $249 to $349, as well as a new suite of colorful iPod Nano players that have more storage capacity and a 24-hour battery life, priced from $149 to $249.Mr. Jobs also introduced an ultrasmall version of the iPod Shuffle for $79 that clips onto clothing. Members of the audience noted that the tiny Shuffle brought to mind a “Saturday Night Live” skit that poked fun at the relentless shrinking of each new generation of iPods.'"
"'06-09-13,'1','At the White House, Tony Snow, Mr. Bush’s spokesman, could hardly disguise his eagerness to go before the cameras to engage the Democrats on turf that Republicans have come to consider their own. He invited reporters who posed questions to him in the morning about Democratic complaints about the speech to ask again at his regular televised briefing, where he said Democrats were politicizing the anniversary and reasserted the White House line that a withdrawal from Iraq would turn it into a terrorist base.On Capitol Hill, Republicans took an even harder line, questioning Democrats’ commitment to fighting terrorists. Representative John A. Boehner, Republican of Ohio, the majority leader, said of the Democrats, “I wonder if they’re more interested in protecting the terrorists than protecting the American people.”Senator Harry Reid, Democrat of Nevada, the minority leader, responded, “Haven’t we moved beyond the fact that Republicans are trying to save us from the terrorists and Democrats aren’t?”But in a sign that there may be limits to how far each side is willing to go in the debate, Mr. Snow initially dodged questions about whether the president condoned Mr. Boehner’s remarks. When Mr. Snow was directly asked whether he believed Democrats were more intent on protecting terrorists than Americans, he answered flatly, “No.”And a senior Republican official, who spoke candidly about political strategy only on the condition of anonymity, expressed some unease with Mr. Boehner’s language.But even some Democrats said they winced when Senator Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, was among the first to criticize the president, allowing the White House, for one news cycle at least, to frame the debate as one between the two men.At the heart of both parties’ calculations are competing visions of what will ultimately move people to the polls this fall. Democrats say they are convinced that with the continued violence in Iraq, a continued stream of threat videos produced by Al Qaeda, and a resurgent Taliban in Afghanistan, Republicans have handed their national security edge to the Democrats.“Given the basic environment is in our direction, you have to stand up to them every time and show strength and that you are not afraid of them,” said Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York, chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. “That’s what we have done over the past few weeks, and we are very happy with the results.”Democrats are taking their fight to the Congressional floor. On Tuesday, Mr. Reid sought to add a broad package of Democratic security proposals to a port security measure in the Senate, drawing complaints from Republicans that he was effectively blocking crucial legislation.In the House, Representative John P. Murtha, Democrat of Pennsylvania, plans to introduce a resolution of no confidence in Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld. If the Republican leadership does not allow a vote, as is likely, Democrats will then begin a petition to force the resolution to the floor.Acknowledging that Democrats have to be careful to look like more than complainers, Jim Jordan, a Democratic strategist, said, “Of course it’s better for the party if we are defining ourselves as muscular and ready to defend the country.”But pointing to polls showing a smaller gap between the parties on national security, he said the Democrats had “fundamentally shifted public perceptions of which party is better able to defend the nation just in terms of domestic security.”Republicans disagree, pointing to successive Republican victories in the past two major elections, each of which was fought over national security policy. In both of those campaigns, critics said Republicans were overplaying their hands and predicted backlashes that did not come to pass. And Republicans have been quick to exploit continued divisions among Democrats over how to proceed in Iraq, often seeking to define the Democratic Party on the basis of positions taken by its more liberal members.“When they make these outrageous statements on national security and try to politicize that issue, that plays to our advantage,” said Ron Bonjean, a spokesman for the House speaker, Representative J. Dennis Hastert, Republican of Illinois. “We’ve chosen the grounds of national security; they’re trying to play on our field.”With control of the White House and both chambers of Congress, Republicans say they plan to run the legislative show in the coming days with bills codifying the president’s domestic spying program and the military tribunal system for detained terrorism suspects, though Republicans in the Senate, including John McCain of Arizona, oppose crucial parts of the tribunal legislation.To goad the effort along, Mr. Bush plans to meet Thursday with Congressional Republicans on Capitol Hill for a closed-door session. And Tuesday, after he met with a group of conservative columnists, National Review Online quoted Mr. Bush as saying that he would have faced loud criticism had he not mentioned Iraq on Monday night, and that his goal was to highlight the stakes in this campaign.Still, even some Republicans had doubts about how much the new national security campaign would help in a climate both sides see as tough.“I don’t think the inside-the-beltway discussion about political tit-for-tat makes any difference in the majority of races around the country,” said Senator John E. Sununu, Republican of New Hampshire.'"
"'06-09-13,'1','BIRMINGHAM, Ala., Sept. 12 (Reuters) — A federal judge sentenced the former chief financial officer of the HealthSouth Corporation, Michael D. Martin, to 36 months in prison on Tuesday, the third time he has been sentenced for his part in a $2.7 billion accounting scandal that rocked the company.Mr. Martin, one of five former chief financial officers at HealthSouth who pleaded guilty to fraud charges in connection with the scandal, previously paid a $50,000 fine and a $2.4 million forfeiture of ill-gotten gains.He was originally sentenced to five months’ probation and was later ordered to serve seven days in prison. Both of those sentences were overturned after prosecutors protested the lenient penalties and appealed the decisions.Mr. Martin had pleaded guilty to securities fraud, conspiracy and other counts for his part in accounting wrongdoing that nearly brought down the operator of rehabilitation hospitals and surgical centers.The new prison term is one of the stiffest received by any of the 15 former executives, who pleaded guilty to taking part in a conspiracy to artificially inflate earnings to prop up the share price.'"
"'06-09-13,'1','The future looks only more ominous as India hurtles into the present, modernizing and urbanizing at blinding speed. Even more of its 1.1 billion people seem destined to become heavier and more vulnerable to Type 2 diabetes, a disease of high blood sugar brought on by obesity, inactivity and genes, often culminating in blindness, amputations and heart failure. In 20 years, projections are that there may be a staggering 75 million Indian diabetics.“Diabetes unfortunately is the price you pay for progress,” said Dr. A. Ramachandran, the managing director of the M.V. Hospital for Diabetes, in Chennai (formerly Madras).For decades, Type 2 diabetes has been the “rich man’s burden,” a problem for industrialized countries to solve.But as the sugar disease, as it is often called, has penetrated the United States and other developed nations, it has also trespassed deep into the far more populous developing world.In Italy or Germany or Japan, diabetes is on the rise. In Bahrain and Cambodia and Mexico — where industrialization and Western food habits have taken hold— it is rising even faster. For the world has now reached the point, according to the United Nations, where more people are overweight than undernourished.Diabetes does not convey the ghastly despair of AIDS or other killers. But more people worldwide now die from chronic diseases like diabetes than from communicable diseases. And the World Health Organization expects that of the more than 350 million diabetics projected in 2025, three-fourths will inhabit the third world.“I’m concerned for virtually every country where there’s modernization going on, because of the diabetes that follows,” said Dr. Paul Zimmet, the director of the International Diabetes Institute in Melbourne, Australia. “I’m fearful of the resources ever being available to address it.”India and China are already home to more diabetics than any other country. Prevalence among adults in India is estimated about 6 percent, two-thirds of that in the United States, but the illness is traveling faster, particularly in the country’s large cities.Throughout the world, Type 2 diabetes, once predominantly a disease of the old, has been striking younger people. But because Indians have such a pronounced genetic vulnerability to the disease, they tend to contract it 10 years earlier than people in developed countries. It is because India is so youthful — half the population is under 25 — that the future of diabetes here is so chilling.In this boiling city of five million perched on the Bay of Bengal, amid the bleating horns of the autorickshaws and the shriveled mendicants peddling combs on the dust-beaten streets, diabetes can be found everywhere.The conventional way to see India is to inspect the want — the want for food, the want for money, the want for life. The 300 million who struggle below the poverty line. The debt-crippled farmers who kill themselves. The millions of children with too little to eat.But there is another way to see it: through its newfound excesses and expanding middle and upper classes. In a changing India, it seems to go this way: make good money and get cars, get houses, get servants, get meals out, get diabetes.In perverse fashion, obesity and diabetes stand almost as joint totems of success.Last year, for instance, the MW fast-food and ice cream restaurant in this city proclaimed a special promotion: “Overweight? Congratulations.” The limited-time deal afforded diners savings equal to 50 percent of their weight (in kilograms). The heaviest arrival lugged in 135 kilograms (297 pounds) and ate lustily at 67.5 percent off.Too much food has pernicious implications for a people with a genetic susceptibility to diabetes, possibly the byproduct of ancestral genes developed to hoard fat during cycles of feast and famine. This vulnerability was first spotted decades ago when immigrant Indians settled in Western countries and in their retrofitted lifestyles got diabetes at levels dwarfing those in India. Now Westernization has come to India and is bringing the disease home.Though 70 percent of the population remains rural, Indians are steadily forsaking paddy fields for a city lifestyle that entails less movement, more fattening foods and higher stress: a toxic brew for diabetes. In Chennai, about 16 percent of adults are thought to have the disease, one of India’s highest concentrations, more than the soaring levels in New York, and triple the rate two decades ago. Three local hospitals, quaintly known as the sugar hospitals, are devoted to the illness.The traditional Indian diet can itself be generous with calories. But urban residents switch from ragi and fresh vegetables to fried fast food and processed goods. The pungent aromas of quick-food emporiums waft everywhere here: Sowbakiya Fast Food, Nic-Nac Fast Food, Pizza Hut. Coke and Pepsi are pervasive, but rarely their diet versions.The country boasts a ravenous sweet tooth, hence the ubiquitous sweet shops, where customers eagerly lap up laddu and badam pista rolls. Sweets are obligatory at social occasions — birthdays, office parties, mourning observances for the dead — and during any visit to someone’s home, a signal of how welcome the visitors are and that God is present.“When you come to the office after getting a haircut, people say, ‘So where are the sweets?’ ” said Dr. N. Murugesan, the project director at the M.V. Hospital for Diabetes.The sovereignty of sweets can pose ticklish choices for a doctor. Trying to set an example, Dr. V. Mohan, chairman of the Diabetes Specialities Centre, a local hospital, said he had omitted sweets at a business affair he arranged, and nearly incited a riot. Last year, his daughter was married. Lesson learned, he laid out a spread of regular sweets on one side of the hall and on the other stationed a table laden with sugar-free treats. Everyone left smiling.In the United States, an inverse correlation persists between income and diabetes. Since fattening food is cheap, the poor become heavier than the rich, and they exercise less and receive inferior health care. In India, the disease tends to directly track income.“Jokingly in talks, I say you haven’t made it in society until you get a touch of diabetes,” Dr. Mohan said. He points out that people who once balanced water jugs and construction material on their heads now carry nothing heavier than a cellphone. At a four-star restaurant, it is not unusual to see a patron yank out his kit and give himself an insulin injection.The very wealthy have begun to recoil at ballooning waistlines, and there has been a rise in slimming centers and stomach-shrinking operations. In high-end stores, one can find a CD, “Music for Diabetes,” with raga selections chosen to dampen stress.The rest of urban India, however, sits and eats.In Chennai, workers in the software industry rank among the envied elite. Doctors worry about their habits — tapping keys for exercise, ingesting junk food at the computer. Dr. C. R. Anand Moses, a local diabetologist, sees a steady parade of eager software professionals, devoured by diabetes. “They work impossible hours sitting still,” he said.S. Venkatesh, 28, a thick-around-the-middle programmer, knows the diabetes narrative. Much of his work is for Western companies that operate during the Indian night. So he works in the dark, sleeps in the day.“The software industry is full of pressure, because you are paid well,” he said. “In India, if you work in software, your hours are the office.”His sole exercise is to sometimes climb the stairs. A year and a half ago, he found out he had diabetes.The diabetic foot is a recurrent backdrop among the unending cases that clog the waiting area at the M.V. Hospital. Dr. Ramachandran, its managing director, sees the parade of festering sores and frightful infections. He knows that only creative thinking can help.The difficulty is that bare feet prevail here. People shuck their shoes before funneling into homes, some offices and always the temple. Farmers go barefoot in the country. In the cities, autorickshaw operators thunder through town, flesh pressed against hot pedals.Diabetes, though, ruins sensation in the legs, and foot infections go undetected and are often a preamble to amputations. So doctors like Dr. Ramachandran strongly recommend against going barefoot. Yet the culture demands precisely the opposite.Seeking a middle ground, Dr. Ramachandran presses his patients to don what he calls Temple Socks during worship. They are made at his hospital, conventional socks with rubber bases stitched inside. They are a slow sell.Dr. Vijay Viswanathan, the hospital’s joint director, gives patients stickers to affix to their bathroom mirrors: “Take care of your feet.” Like doctors elsewhere, he promotes custom shoes. He drifted into them because of leprosy footwear.Leprosy damages feet and requires special shoes, with tougher undersoles and without nails or sharp edges, that also suit diabetics. But when the diabetics in the telltale footwear appeared at restaurants, they were shooed away, thought to be lepers. So now the hospital makes distinctly different designs.The consequences of the diabetic foot can be grim. While the affliction knows no class distinctions, the solutions do.In his lectures, Dr. Ramachandran recounts the case of an impoverished diabetic with a hideously infected leg. Unable to find medical care, he laid the leg across the railroad tracks. The next train to hurtle past did the surgery.For a limb replacement, the very poor may make do with a $50 wooden leg that does not bend. A woman like Mrs. Chitrarangarajan, 49, who runs a school for the autistic and is married to an oil executive, opts for the best. Her right leg was surrendered to diabetes in 2001. She found a German leg for $6,000 and ordered it over the Internet.S. P. M. Ameer owned a shoe store when diabetes befell him 30 years ago. Soon, circulatory problems attacked, he closed his shop, he lost his wife, then his leg last January.Now, at 58, occupying a mirthless room in a cheap hotel on a rackety side street, he no longer recognized the solemn shape of his life. He rarely left his squalid room. “Who hires a man without a leg?” he asked.He had yet to arrange for a prosthesis. He had no way to pay for one. “God has to apply,” he said.These stories circulate. But the cultural imperatives hold strong. Even in the sugar hospitals, with admonishments plastered on the walls, some patients insouciantly stride about barefoot. Directly outside the office of one local sugar doctor, beside a sign preaching against the perils of bare feet, another sign notified patients to remove their shoes before entering. And so, barefoot, they sat before him and heard him lecture them not to go barefoot.Krishnasamy Srinivasan, 66, did not look good. He rarely did anymore. He was recumbent in a hospital bed, his shirt off, his eyes underslung with bags. He had come in by train for another checkup. He now lived deep in the suburbs, where it was cheaper, part of the sad new mix of his life.He had done very well as a textile exporter, came to own four homes, and enjoyed rental income from those he did not occupy. Then diabetes hit when he was 40. He paid it little mind as it marinated inside his body. Over the last 15 years came heart problems and the need for bypass surgery. His kidneys deteriorated. He is now on dialysis.He held up the needle-marked right arm of his malfunctioning body, identifying it as “my dialysis arm.”He had to stop working. To cover the medical costs, he sold three of the homes. His family has been living off the evaporating proceeds, their past irreclaimable.Diabetes is bankrupting people in the country, often the reasonably well off, and mainly because of a lack of insurance.Few in India have health insurance, and among those who do, policies generally do not cover diabetes. Middle-class diabetics often exhaust a quarter or more of their income on medications and care. Instances abound where the sick must sell their possessions and compress their lives to feed the diabetes maw.S. Kalyanasundaram, the chief regional manager in charge at the Chennai office of the National Insurance Company, one of the country’s biggest, explained that the issue with insurance was the odds. “Insurance can only work if the law of averages applies,” he said. “There are too many people with diabetes.”Some concepts are easy to sell in India, Mr. Kalyanasundaram said, but health insurance is not one of them. “The capacity to pay is not there,” he said. “And many people take disease as a God-given thing to just accept. So why buy insurance?”Things are beginning to change, even the possibility that policies may cover diabetes for an appropriate premium, but who knows how much they will change? Mr. Kalyanasundaram mentioned that certain preferential customers merited customized policies with an unorthodox clause. If they have diabetes and claim no expenses for four years, then afterward their diabetes will be covered.“We are testing a belief,” he said. “We think it possible that if diabetes doesn’t manifest in those four years, then it will not manifest in the future.”It was an odd thought for a disease that usually worsens with time. As for the results, he said it was too early to know how the test was going. “We are still testing.”With many things it is still too early in India. And so rural dwellers often cope with unavailable or inaccessible health care, frequently relying on unlicensed doctors, many knowing little, if anything, about diabetes. Diabetes researchers estimate that three-quarters of those stricken with the disease in rural villages do not know they have it.In urban areas, the sick, other than the poorest, prefer to bypass beleaguered government hospitals and seek private care. But without insurance, the cost of a long-term illness can be crushing.Mr. Srinivasan’s wife, Srinivasan Muthammal, 61, also has the sugar, but not its complications yet. Like her husband, she is overweight. As she listened to him talk of their black hours, her face was frozen.“We are angry with the god,” she said. “You gave us four houses in four directions and all the wealth, and now you have taken it all away. Why?”Mr. Srinivasan suggested they had cash for one more year, perhaps a little more.“I’m angry with the diabetes,” he said. “You are a pauper all because of the sugar.”Divorce is rare in India, but in these changing times it is very much on the upsweep. Diabetes, here and there, even figures in the marital strife. Women may be stigmatized. Men find themselves impotent and then newly single.K. Sumathi, a Chennai lawyer who sometimes deals in the accelerating number of divorces, appreciates the impact of diabetes in a country where different centuries breathe side by side.She said a young woman with diabetes, for example, is often deemed damaged and unmarriageable, or must marry into a lower caste. Indian law recognizes five broad grounds for divorce, one being if either spouse acquires a chronic disease. Diabetes can rapidly debilitate a breadwinner and impose impotency, either outcome a solid marriage wrecker.She told the story of a recent case: A wife, living as custom has it with her in-laws, said the stress of the circumstances contributed to her getting diabetes. She wound up in a diabetic coma and had to be hospitalized. Her husband, a dentist, chose to attend to cavities rather than visit her. The divorce was completed seven months ago.There was also the account of a husband who accused his unhappy wife of sneaking extra sugar in his tea, hoping he would acquire diabetes and die. It proved to be a poor concept. He survived. The marriage did not.J. Vasanthakumari, a marriage counselor who is friendly with Ms. Sumathi, said she has seen the disease percolate in the back stories of some of her clientele. Diabetes. Then sexual dysfunction. Unhappiness. Appointments with her.“You must understand one basic thing,” she said. “People in personal matters will not bring diabetes to the surface. But women tell me, ‘He’s not affectionate, he’s not taking care of me, he’s not like before.’ It’s the diabetes.”She went on: “Sometimes someone gets diabetes partly because he’s an alcoholic. The marriage falls apart. The real reason is the alcoholism. But the diabetes becomes the last straw on the camel’s back.”The shabby disease remedy shop was small for its outsize promises. A dusty storefront crunched between souvenir stands, it sat near the Kapaleeswarar temple, a familiar tourist choice in Chennai. Inside spilled a teetering mass of ready relief for arthritis, heartburn, gout, piles. Beneath the scalding sun, an ox cart pounded past, scattering a swarm of people padding down the street.The grizzled proprietor, who was asked if he had anything for diabetes, readily proffered a bottle of pea-soup-colored liquid. It cost roughly $3. Its exact contents, the man said, were as privileged as Coke’s formula. But drink a capful twice a day for three months, he assured, and the diabetes would vanish.Though no universal cure exists for diabetes, “cures” and other mischievous medicines nonetheless abound in India. Much of the population gravitates to cryptic beliefs threaded with untruths that are hard to nullify.People believe in bitter gourd juice and fenugreek, an Indian spice, which can temper sugar levels, but are not cures. Some years ago, the wood water cure gained considerable traction. Drink water stored overnight in a tumbler made of Pterocarpus marsupium heartwood, the promotion went, and it would wash away the diabetes.All this exasperates Dr. Murugesan. He is among those trying to stanch the spread of the disease. Diabetes education is hard enough, without tomfoolery and witchcraft to discredit.He had something to show on his desktop computer at the M.V. Hospital for Diabetes, a prevention program known as “Chubby Cheeks.” Animated mothers on the screen merrily admitted that they associated being chubby with health. Animated chubby students chafed that their parents refused to let them play, but forced them to study endlessly so they could become doctors and engineers. They studied, they sat, they enlarged. Dr. Murugesan takes his cautionary tale around to schools and waves it like a lantern.Dr. Murugesan is himself an Indian diabetes story. A health educator, he devoted 20 years to erasing leprosy in southern India. Two years ago, with that scourge largely beaten back, he itched for a fresh menace. He chose diabetes. He saw its rapid ascent.What’s more, he had diabetes.Upon enlisting in the sugar fight, he felt it behooved him to test the blood sugar levels of his own family, and he excavated truths he had not wished for. His wife, daughter and one of his sons were all bordering on becoming diabetic. His other son, just 28 then, already had diabetes.“I say it’s like Jesus Christ,” he said. “When you don’t look for him, he’s not there. When you look for him, he’s there. You look for diabetes, and it’s there.”Prevention, he recognizes, is a mountainous climb in a country with a severe shortage of medical workers. What health care money exists is overwhelmingly applied to infectious perils.The health minister, Dr. Anbumani Ramadoss, recently said he would begin a diabetes program, but the timetable and scope are unclear. Indian politicians in pursuit of votes rarely campaign on matters of health, but promise the poor cheap rice or free color televisions.All of which perpetuates a dual continuum. Rural Indians flock to the cities, only to encounter diabetes, while Westernization sweeps its way to the villages, carrying diabetes as its passenger.Thus Dr. Mohan, among other efforts, dispatches prevention teams to Chunampet, a cluster of villages a couple of hours south that are a feeder area for Chennai. Most of the villagers have no idea what diabetes is.Meanwhile, Dr. Murugesan has enlistees operating in the Srinivasapuram slum, a grid of cramped thatched huts and makeshift tents that hug Chennai’s long beach.The diabetes rates among these raggedly lives are notably below those of the middle and upper classes. But they are catching up.When evening gushes over the slum and the mosquitoes emerge, a scattering of diabetics drift over to the tiny Vijaya Medical shop. They are poor at “self-poking,” as they explain, and have no refrigerators to chill their insulin. Some fill mud pots with water and stuff their vials in there. Others rely on the medical shop proprietor, a merry young man with legs withered by polio.He tapes their names to the appropriate bottles and, each day, administers shots.Misconceptions populate the conversations. Some residents say they occasionally have diabetes: a few years with it, then a few years without it. They think that diabetes pays visits.Others are rabid apologists for the disease. Uninterested in eating less, they say that when they feel like a big meal, a luscious plate of sweets, they just swallow an extra pill or inject themselves with more insulin.“They don’t understand,” Dr. Murugesan said. “They don’t see the darkness of this disease.”Late in the day, back at the M.V. Hospital, he trooped upstairs to the rooftop auditorium, where 40-odd doctors had assembled to talk about prevention efforts. One thing they talked of uncomfortably: A particular profession in India, they heard, a well-paying one involving a lot of standing around, had practitioners who did not necessarily heed their own advice.The profession was thick with diabetes. It was doctors themselves.'"
"'06-09-13,'1','The Kroger Company, the nation’s largest supermarket chain, said yesterday that its second-quarter earnings rose 6.4 percent as discounts and higher-priced gasoline led to higher sales. But the shares fell 5.5 percent after profit margins missed some analysts’ estimates.The company’s net income climbed to $209 million, or 29 cents a share, from $196.5 million, or 27 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue grew 9.2 percent, to $15.1 billion.While gasoline sales helped revenue, they also narrowed profit margins, the company said. Investors may have been expecting an increase in the annual profit forecast because of the quarter’s results, said David G. Dietze, president of Point View Financial Services in Summit, N.J., which manages $110 million including Kroger shares.Gross margin, or the percentage of sales left after subtracting the cost of goods sold, narrowed to 23.5 percent of sales, from 24.6 percent.The company reiterated its forecast for per-share profit growth of 6 percent to 8 percent for the year ending in February, including legal reserves.“Full-year expectations are a little light,” Mr. Dietze said. There is a “disconnect between the stellar quarter” and the forecast for the year, he said.'"
"'06-09-13,'1','Officials at many elite colleges and universities said yesterday that they would carefully consider how to respond to Harvard University’s decision to eliminate early admissions, though none were yet ready to follow Harvard’s lead.“This will be a big topic of discussion on all these college campuses,” said Richard L. Nesbitt, director of admission at Williams College. “It is something we will consider. Will we change? I don’t know.”Harvard will be the first of the nation’s prestigious universities to do away with early admissions, beginning with students who apply after the current academic year. Officials of the university say such programs, under which students apply early in the fall and learn before Christmas whether they have been accepted, put low-income and minority applicants at a disadvantage.James S. Miller, dean of admission at Brown University, said Harvard’s decision, which was formally announced yesterday, had surprised and intrigued many people in higher education. “It clearly is a significant change in the admissions landscape,” Mr. Miller said. “We will look at our programs. We don’t anticipate making a change at this point.”At Williams, Brown, Dartmouth, Cornell and many other highly selective institutions, students who apply early must, in return for early acceptance, give an ironclad commitment to attend. Critics argue that this forces low-income students to commit before being able to compare financial aid offerings from that college and others.'"
"'06-09-13,'1','WASHINGTON, Sept. 12 — Ending a long and cantankerous standoff with House Democratic leaders, Howard Dean, the chairman of the Democratic National Committee, has agreed to a limited program to finance get-out-the-vote operations this November, party officials said Tuesday.But Mr. Dean remained at loggerheads with Senate Democrats, who continued to insist he provide more money.The committee said it would provide $12 million to finance turnout operations for candidates running for the House and the Senate, and for state races. Just $2.6 million would go to finance turnout operations in 40 House races, far less than House Democratic leaders had asked for.By contrast, the Republican National Committee has said it will spend more than $30 million of the $176 million raised this cycle to finance Republican turnout efforts, most of it going to House and Senate races.Mr. Dean had staved off demands for more money from Democratic leaders in Congress, saying it was in the long-term interest of the Democrats to instead use the nearly $100 million he has raised this year to build strong Democratic organizations in all 50 states by giving them money to hire staff members.The disagreement had sparked a lively feud between Mr. Dean and Representative Rahm Emanuel of Illinois, who is leading the Democratic effort to win back the House. Mr. Emanuel and Mr. Dean stopped speaking to each other several months ago.Mr. Emanuel’s aides said he was satisfied with the deal. “Yeah, we’re happy,” said Bill Burton, a spokesman for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. “Between our effort, the D.N.C. effort, the labor effort and what other Democrats are doing, we’re going to have what we need for voter turnout.”'"
"'06-09-13,'1','Senator John McCain of Arizona said he and two other Republican senators crucial to the discussions, John W. Warner of Virginia and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, would not agree to any narrowing of the provision.Mr. McCain said such a move could send a message about the nation’s support for human rights and the precedent it might set for special forces captured by other countries.“On the detainee-treatment issue,” he said, “Senator Warner and I and Senator Graham and others are not going to agree to changes in the definitions in Common Article 3, because that then sends the message to the world that we are not going to adhere fully to the Geneva Conventions. And we worry about, in the future, other nations maybe deciding to interpret Common Article 3 to their own purposes.”Mr. McCain is influential on detainee questions because of his years as a Vietnam prisoner of war. The three senators made their appeal for their approach at the weekly Republican Party lunch after a presentation by Vice President Dick Cheney.In addition to talking with Mr. Cheney, the senators have extensively negotiated with Attorney General Alberto R. Gonzales and Stephen J. Hadley, the national security adviser. Gen. Michael V. Hayden, the director of the Central Intelligence Agency, also discussed the topic on Tuesday with lawmakers on Capitol Hill.The compromise on classified evidence would have a judge review the evidence and give a summary to be presented to the jury and the accused. Anything less, the senators have said, would constitute a secret trial.The White House bill proposed last week would deny a suspect the right to see classified evidence that the jury might use to convict him.Mr. Graham said the White House was “O.K.” with the compromise.To address the White House concerns over Common Article 3, Mr. Graham said, the Senate would agree to redefine the War Crimes Act and make more specific the provision in it that says a violation of Common Article 3 is punishable by death.“The administration is concerned that Common Article 3 can be used to sue our guys, to put our guys in jail, that they’re in an unfair position, and I would agree,” Mr. Graham said.The changes, he added, said, would define the cases in which “grave breaches” of Common Article 3 constitute a war crime and would bar “serious criminal physical misconduct and inhumane treatment of a serious nature.”'"
"'06-09-13,'1','The law, enacted in 1992, aims to curb aggressive tactics by animal rights groups against testing laboratories, fur farms and related enterprises. A stronger version of the law, the Animal Enterprise Terrorism Act, was introduced in Congress this summer and has wide support.Dr. John D. Young, the chairman of Americans for Medical Progress, a biomedical research organization, said the sentences assured that “our nation’s law enforcement system will not tolerate terror tactics that include threatening e-mails, telephone calls, vandalism and attacks on the privacy of researchers’ homes.”The judge, Anne E. Thompson, sentenced the former president of Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty, Kevin Kjonaas, 28, of Minneapolis, to six years in prison. Lauren Gazzola, 26, of Connecticut, the group’s former campaign coordinator, was sentenced to four years and four months. The Web site coordinator, Jacob Conroy, 30, of Oakland, Calif., received a four-year sentence.The organization itself was convicted and ordered to pay $1 million in restitution, although the lawyer representing the group said it no longer exists. Three other defendants are to be sentenced, one on Wednesday and two next week.The defendants were convicted in March of conspiracy and stalking, but not with carrying out any destructive acts. Their lawyers argued that they were socially conscious young people who were carried away by their beliefs. Judge Thompson acknowledged receiving hundreds of letters urging leniency in her sentencing.Mr. Kjonaas told the judge: “I’m utterly humbled. I came here with my mother. This has been a traumatic experience, a learning experience, and I don’t know what more I could say.”But Judge Thompson recalled a taped conversation in which “anyone who listened would recognize a sense of glee, almost, in wielding power.”Ms. Gazzola, who taught test preparation courses for law school applicants, told the judge that even in prison she would not give up her own hope of becoming a lawyer. Near tears, she said, “The decision to pursue law school is something I chose two weeks before I was arrested.”An unofficial spokeswoman for the defendants, Andrea Lindsay, said all three planned to appeal their convictions. Ms. Lindsay, who came from California, bristled at the prosecutors’ complaints that the defendants did not express remorse. “They’re not going to roll over and apologize for illegal acts of others,” she said.Ms. Lindsay was among at least 100 supporters, including others from Florida, Pennsylvania and New York, who spilled out of the courtroom. Watched by a contingent of Trenton police officers and federal officers, the largely young crowd exchanged news of the sentences among themselves.Ms. Lindsay said that “it’s sad for all of us to see our friends go to prison, but at the end of the day, it’s six individuals, and there are hundreds, thousands of people campaigning against Huntingdon.”Animal rights groups say the company kills hundreds of dogs, monkeys and other animals each day in its testing of consumer products at its laboratories in Britain and East Millstone, N.J.'"
"'06-09-13,'1','Listing factors that contributed to the new premium, Dr. McClellan reported “a modest slowdown in physician spending growth” but “very rapid growth in spending for hospital outpatient services.” Many services provided in outpatient hospital clinics “could be performed less expensively and more conveniently in a physician’s office,” he said.Kirsten A. Sloan, a health policy analyst at AARP, the lobby for older Americans, said: “The standard premium for Part B is less than originally projected, and that’s good news. But the premium is artificially low. It assumes a continuation of current law, under which Medicare payments to doctors will be cut 5 percent next year. If Congress decides to prevent that cut, beneficiaries may have to make up the difference by paying higher premiums in 2008.”The premium is set each year to cover about 25 percent of projected spending under Part B. If Congress had eliminated the cut planned for doctors and simply frozen their Medicare fees in 2007, it would have required a further increase of roughly $1.50 in the monthly premium, Medicare officials said.Congress established the surcharge under a little-noticed provision of the 2003 law that added a prescription drug benefit to Medicare. Federal officials said the surcharge, to be phased in over the next three years, represented a major change. Until now, high-income and middle-income beneficiaries have generally paid the same premium. Medicare officials said the surcharge would raise $7.7 billion in the first five years and a total of $20.8 billion in the first 10 years.Dr. McClellan said the surcharge would have “a very positive impact, making Medicare more sustainable in the long term.” Some Medicare experts say the higher premiums will prompt some wealthy people to drop out of Medicare, leaving the program to serve poorer, sicker people. Dr. McClellan dismissed those concerns, saying Medicare would still be a bargain for high-income people.Federal health officials estimate that 9,000 people will drop out of Part B because of the surcharge in 2007, while 30,000 will drop out in 2009, when the surcharge becomes larger.In calculating the extra premiums for 2007, the government will generally use income data from tax returns for 2005. For a single person with income of $80,001 to $100,000, and for each member of a couple filing a joint return with combined income of $160,001 to $200,000, the surcharge will be $12.50 a month, and the total premium will be $106 a month.The surcharge rises with income. For an individual with income greater than $200,000 and for each member of a couple with combined income exceeding $400,000, the surcharge will be $68.60 a month in 2007, and the total premium will be $162.10 a month. The surcharge will be much higher in 2008 and later years.In announcing the new premiums, the administration appeared to send a mixed message. On the one hand, Dr. McClellan said, “Medicare beneficiaries are experiencing cost increases that are modest in comparison with recent health care cost trends.” On the other hand, he said, spending in the traditional fee-for-service Medicare program is “out of control.”'"

"'06-09-13,'1','MOSCOW, Sept. 12 — Arkady I. Volsky, a confidant of the Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev and founder of Russia’s most prominent business lobby, died here on Saturday. He was 74.The cause was complications of leukemia, according to the Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs, the business lobby he founded in 1991 and directed until last year; it became known as a club for the Russian oligarchs.Mr. Volsky belonged to a generation of officials whose careers straddled the breakup of the Soviet Union. He worked under four Soviet general secretaries and three Russian presidents and served as a peace negotiator in two wars. His successor at the business lobby, Aleksandr N. Shokhin, described him as “a man of the Soviet system who was accepted by the capitalists.”Mr. Volsky grew up an orphan in Dobrush, Belarus, in the 1930’s and worked on the floor of the Zil truck and limousine plant in Moscow, eventually becoming the factory’s party boss.Then, Mr. Volsky had his biggest career break without even interviewing for the job. It came under Yuri V. Andropov, the former K.G.B. chief who became general secretary, Mr. Volsky recalled in a recent interview with the newspaper Kommersant, republished on Tuesday.'"
"'06-09-13,'1','Safety at work is no laughing matter, Mr. Callaghan, formerly the chief economist at the Trades Union Congress, said indignantly. Last year, he noted, 220 people were killed on the job. In the late 1960’s — before the passage of the landmark Health and Safety at Work Act of 1974, which among other things established his agency and its sister, the Health and Safety Executive — the annual figure was about 1,200 deaths.Britain has indeed become more risk-averse in recent years, largely because of a pervasive public fear of American-style litigation. But as Mr. Callaghan points out, payouts in liability cases in Britain are far lower than they are in the United States — about one-third as much per capita — and most lawsuits are dismissed before ever getting to trial.By the same token, he said, he believes that many of the decisions made in the name of health and safety in Britain are indeed asinine. These include schools requiring children to wear protective goggles when playing with nuts that have fallen from trees; schools banning bandages because of fears of latex allergies; and village fairs forbidding people to sell homemade cakes in case they contain contaminated eggs.But the commission is blamed for them anyway. It set up a myth-busting page on its Web site explaining, for instance, that it was not involved in the decision last April to cancel a St. George’s Day breakfast in Wiltshire, after local officials ruled that the volunteer cooks were not formally trained in egg preparation.Some of the examples are more ambiguous, though, illustrating how hard it can be to walk the line between traditional stiff-upper-lipness and modern caution. In another example on the Web site, the agency rebuts an article claiming that it has forbidden window washers to use ladders, lest they fall off. Ian Greenwood, who is identified as the head of the agency’s “Falls From Height Program,” is quoted as saying that ladders can indeed be used, as long as the “task is low-risk and of short duration,” and all safer, non-ladder alternatives have been ruled out.Mr. Greenwood notes that 14 people died, and more than 1,000 were injured, after falling from ladders in 2004. He directs interested parties to the agency’s sensible-ladder-use campaign, which includes the publication, “Safe Use of Ladders and Stepladders.”Even if it is incorrect, the prevailing notion that every mishap ends with someone suing someone else has irrevocably changed Britons’ mind-sets. Children who leave their coats and bags in special containers on field trips to the Science Museum in London, for example, are instructed by posted signs not to put anything on the lids, on account of Health and Safety rules. People buying cups of tea on British trains are ordered to carry them in paper bags for safety reasons — whether they want to or not.Sailing down the placid Thames a year ago as part of the celebration marking the 200th anniversary of the Battle of Trafalgar, the actor playing Lord Nelson was required to accessorize his vintage admiral’s outfit with a contemporary life preserver, which tended to spoil the effect.Nor are the Health and Safety Commission offices, at the end of Southwark Bridge in East London, immune to dispensing their own cautionary advice. Along with security passes, visitors are issued photocopied pamphlets offering instructions on how to identify the sound of the fire alarm (a “continuous ringing of bells”); where to go if a fire does break out (convene at the location marked on the map on the back); and what to do if they feel sick or fall down (there is a first-aid room on the first floor; all injuries, “no matter how minor,” must be reported).The agency’s new charm offensive has had mixed results. “Nanny-in-Chief Confesses,” The Daily Mail wrote approvingly about Mr. Callaghan’s campaign, as if he were a Mao-era Chinese official engaging in ritual self-criticism. But in The Sunday Times of London, the columnist Roland White said, “For him to attack the nanny state is a bit like the chairman of the Football Association complaining that high wages are ruining the game.”But Mr. Callaghan is on the skeptics’ side, he says, having experienced annoyingly overzealous regulations himself. After his 17-year-old son’s class traveled to upstate New York for a school ski trip, he said, students were forbidden to swim in the hotel pool with children from other schools, because their school’s risk assessors had determined that it was too dangerous.Mr. Callaghan was just as exasperated as you would be, if it were your child’s school, and please don’t blame the Health and Safety Commission. “It’s not something we would get involved in,” he said.'"
"'06-09-13,'1','Harvard did the right thing by abandoning its early admissions program, the first elite college to do so. We hope other institutions follow its lead and eliminate a process that is inevitably unfair and simply increases the frenzy of a college application process that is unnecessarily pressurized.Early admissions programs allow students to apply early, typically in November, and get a prompt answer, usually in mid-December, before the regular application season begins in January. The most draconian of these programs require students to agree in advance that they will accept admission if it is offered. Those rejected have a couple of frantic weeks to apply elsewhere.Colleges love these programs because they can lock in students who really want to enroll, gain an early sense of how admissions are going, and spread out the workload of evaluating applicants. For high-achieving students, it means knowing early whether they will get into their dream college. There is some evidence that applying early increases the chance of admission.But educators have come to realize that the binding programs have two pernicious effects. They discriminate against students who need financial aid and thus can’t commit themselves to one university before they have a chance to compare the aid packages offered by other schools. And they force students to pick a college in the fall, rather than make a more considered choice in the spring.Harvard has long had a relatively relaxed policy that mitigates some of these problems. Students who apply by Nov. 1 are notified by Dec. 15 as to whether they are admitted, rejected or deferred to the regular pool for further consideration. They don’t have to answer Harvard’s offer of admission until May 1 and can shop around for better offers. Several other schools, including Yale and Stanford, have adopted similar policies.Now Harvard has decided to go cold turkey and eliminate its early admissions program beginning with the freshman class entering in September 2008. This is a big step given that 38 percent of the students admitted last year were granted early admission. There will be a two- to three-year trial period to make sure the change does not adversely affect student quality.Harvard cited several good reasons for the change. It will make the system fairer because students from sophisticated backgrounds and affluent high schools are far more likely to apply for an early admission than minority students or those from high schools with few counselors. It will help reduce the frenzy that has high school students worrying about college choices in their junior years. It will give admissions officers another semester of performance to consider instead of basing early admission on the junior-year record. And there will be the collateral benefit of encouraging high school seniors to keep studying well into the spring instead of goofing off the minute they receive early admission.'"
"'06-09-13,'1','BRUSSELS, Sept. 13 — The competition regulator for the European Union clashed with Microsoft again on Tuesday, this time over security upgrades in the company’s new Windows Vista operating system.The European Commission, the European Union’s executive arm, warned Microsoft against foreclosing competition in computer security by tying new security features into its new product, which is expected to go on sale soon, saying that could harm consumers.Responding to expressions of concern by the company over the commission’s stance, a spokesman for the competition regulator, Jonathan Todd, said it was up to Microsoft, as “a near monopolist,” to ensure compliance with antitrust rules in the new system.Open competition and diversity were the best way of improving software security, he said.“Such diversity and innovation could be at risk if Microsoft was allowed to foreclose the existing competition in computer security markets by bundling its own security products into its dominant operating system,” Mr. Todd said.His warning echoed a landmark 2004 ruling in which the commission found that Microsoft had abused its market dominance in audiovisual software players and office servers, forcing the company to strip out Windows Media Player, which was tied into its ubiquitous operating system.Microsoft said earlier that it hoped the commission would not require the removal of important security features from Windows Vista in Europe.“We want to launch Windows Vista in a fully lawful manner and we want to avoid regulatory decisions that could increase security risks for European consumers,” said Erich Andersen, vice president and associate general counsel for Europe.'"
"'06-09-13,'1','The committee will consider whether Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which requires audits of internal controls at corporations, should be changed. Critics say that such audits are too expensive and have kept foreign companies from listing their securities in the United States.Mr. Scott said the committee would also review whether the Securities and Exchange Commission needed to adopt better procedures to weigh the costs and benefits of its regulations, and whether some other government agency should be charged with reviewing those decisions.The final area to be discussed, he said, is shareholder rights, including the efforts of hedge funds to force changes in corporate policies, and whether shareholder approval should be required for takeover defenses.While the committee includes many officers of companies that are subject to regulation by the S.E.C., it includes no former agency chairmen or commissioners, or people who held major S.E.C. staff positions.“We generally tried not to include regulators,” Mr. Scott said. “We would not want to put people in the position who had formulated these rules in the past. They may have a lack of objectivity.”He noted that one member, Robert Glauber, a visiting professor at Harvard Law School and a former chairman of NASD, did have experience in regulation.“Anybody on this committee is in the real world and will bring with them real-world perspectives,” he said.Mr. Hubbard said the committee would be knowledgeable about regulation. “Many of these people have S.E.C. interaction on a regular basis,” he said, adding that the academics involved, either as members of the panel or as advisers, were experts in many areas of securities law and regulation.Among the committee members are Samuel A. DiPiazza Jr., chief executive of the accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers, and Donald L. Evans, the former commerce secretary who is now chief executive of the Financial Services Forum, a lobbying group for major insurers, banks and investment banks. Mr. Paulson is a former chairman of the group.There are also chief executives of DuPont, Office Depot and the CIT Group, and top officers of mutual fund companies, Lehman Brothers and the New York Stock Exchange. William G. Parrett, chief executive of Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu, another major accounting firm, is also a member, as is Ira M. Millstein, a leading corporate lawyer.Accounting firms have been seeking legislative relief from liability suits over failed audits, a matter the committee will consider. Asked if the chairmen of such firms might lack objectivity, Mr. Scott said that they might also oppose some issues the committee planned to consider. “These big auditing firms have been the big beneficiaries of 404,” he said. “We are thinking of changing 404.”The group plans to have an interim report in November, a date Mr. Hubbard said Mr. Paulson had requested. That could allow its recommendations to be considered at post-election meetings of Congress, although Mr. Scott said he thought the idea was to have proposals ready for the new Congress in January.Mr. Scott said that academics would prepare papers for the committee, and that those papers could form the basis for parts of the report. Luigi Zingales, a professor at the University of Chicago business school and a committee member, will prepare a report on the overall issue of competitiveness.Robert E. Litan of Brookings will report on liability matters, Mr. Glauber will discuss the regulatory framework and Andrew Kuritzkes of Mercer Oliver Wyman, a consulting firm, will assess the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.Allen Ferrell of Harvard Law School will report on shareholder rights, John C. Coffee Jr. of Columbia Law School on securities class-action suits, and Kenneth E. Scott of Stanford Law School on federal-state conflict in regulation.Reinier H. Kraakman of Harvard Law School will report on liability issues involving directors and investment banks, and John K. Villa, a criminal defense lawyer and a partner in the firm of Williams & Connolly, will discuss criminal enforcement of securities laws.'"
"'06-09-13,'1','Shares rose the most in about a month yesterday, led by retailers like Home Depot as investors bet that falling crude oil prices would propel consumer spending and lift corporate profits while easing inflation.Home Depot, the home improvement chain, led the Dow’s surge to near the highs seen in May. The Standard & Poor’s retail index shot up 3.1 percent — its biggest one-day percentage gain in more than three years.A stronger-than-expected quarterly profit from Best Buy, the electronics chain, gave investors another reason to buy retail stocks.“As prices for crude and gas come down, people are feeling that energy costs will be less of a drag on the economy,” said Christopher Zook, chairman and chief investment officer at CAZ Investments in Houston. “So that’s making people a little more optimistic about the outlook.”The Dow Jones industrial average climbed 101.25 points, or 0.9 percent, to end at 11,498.09.

"'06-09-13,'1','The question has scientific and legal implications. About 30,000 people have sued Merck, saying they or members of their families had heart attacks or strokes after taking Vioxx. Merck has argued that all painkillers appear to carry some heart risks, while many scientists say Vioxx appears riskier than other medicines.Merck disputed the findings published yesterday, saying in a statement that it did not believe Vioxx was more dangerous than other painkillers. The company also noted that Vioxx’s label had always warned of its potential to cause high blood pressure. Vioxx and Celebrex are part of a class of drugs developed in the 1990’s called cox-2 inhibitors. They are designed to reduce pain and inflammation without causing stomach or gastrointestinal bleeding.In the Harvard study, the three researchers examined clinical trials conducted in the last decade on the cox-2 drugs. Their analysis showed Vioxx was associated with increases in rates of high blood pressure in 40 clinical trials covering 38,000 patients. High blood pressure, or hypertension, is closely linked to heart attacks and congestive heart failure. Vioxx was also associated with heart rhythm disturbances, kidney problems and edema, or swelling.“This study merely confirms what has been known about Vioxx for several years,” said Eric Weinberg, a lawyer who represents people suing Merck over Vioxx. “It’s no surprise.”But the study’s authors also found that Celebrex, which is made by Pfizer and remains on the market, was actually associated with somewhat reduced rates of kidney problems and hypertension. The researchers examined 37 Celebrex trials, covering 45,000 patients. The other drugs, including Bextra, a Pfizer painkiller that has been withdrawn, had no association, positive or negative, with kidney problems and hypertension.The analysis cannot confirm that Vioxx is uniquely dangerous or Celebrex uniquely safe. The drugs could cause heart problems in ways beyond raising blood pressure, such as by increasing the risk of blood clots. But it provides a signal that Vioxx may be more dangerous than Celebrex and other cox-2 drugs, said Eric Ding, one of the paper’s authors.“We cannot necessarily say all cox-2 drugs have similar adverse risk profiles,” Mr. Ding said, “which has implications for the ethical development and testing of future drugs in this class.”The paper written by the two researchers at the University of New South Wales in Australia examined the results of observational studies that covered the cox-2 drugs and older painkillers. The researchers found that Vioxx had more heart risks than Celebrex and that naproxen, an older painkiller, appeared to be even safer.'"

Now she and her husband, Mo Chin, a photographer, have opened Joyce Bakeshop in Prospect Heights, Brooklyn, joining a number of good new bakeries in that borough.Miniature iced two-bite cupcakes are tempting enough: a dollop of marshmallow delays the impact of the dark chocolate variety, milk chocolate frosting embellishes vanilla cupcakes, and a swirl of cream cheese bolsters red velvet ones ($2 each). They leave plenty of room for baby croissants ($1.50), and crisply caramelized palmiers ($1). Other choices include elegant individual plum cakes and raspberry tartlets ($4) and small, homey black-and-whites ($1.50).The bakery serves Gorilla Coffee and has sunny tables and wooden banquettes in the front of the spacious store at 646 Vanderbilt Avenue (Park Place), Prospect Heights, Brooklyn, (718) 623-7470.When he was the chef at Oliveto in Oakland, Calif., Paul Bertolli was at the forefront of the trend of chefs curing their own charcuterie. So dedicated was he that he gave up his job to devote himself full-time to making Italian cured meats, both sausage and dry salami. His Fra’Mani salamis, made from pork raised on small family farms, are sold online and at a number of stores. The name Fra’Mani is a contraction of fratelli mani, meaning the brother’s hands.There are five salami varieties: salametto, a sweet, garlicky small-diameter sausage; nostrano, bigger and bolder, with a more peppery personality; gentile, sweet and mild; soppressata, another big salami, very meaty and fragrant with cloves; and toscano, aged with an alluring smokiness. Fairway in New York and Brooklyn sells them all for $19.96 a pound. At Bedford Cheese in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, the salametto is $16 for a whole salami (about 12 ounces); the others are $23 a pound. Sausages and salami are also available online at framani.com.There is an ice-cream flavor for each New York City borough at 5 Boroughs Ice Cream, a new little company in Astoria, Queens, owned by Scott Myles, a graphic designer, and his wife, Kim, a hairdresser. The cream comes from local dairies.Bakla-Wha?!, the flavor that represents Queens (and the Greek population of Astoria), has bits of toasty phyllo and walnuts in a creamy vanilla base; it’s my hands-down favorite.

"'06-09-13,'1','THERE are 1,000 ceramic bells on Alexander Saunders’ farm. They tinkle sweetly in the breeze across the river from Storm King Mountain, where Mr. Saunders’ father helped give birth to the environmental movement back in the 1960’s with the successful fight against a proposed Con Ed hydroelectric plant.There’s a slalom course of mylar wind socks he traverses in his Volvo station wagon, a sea serpent made of rocks, a hollow ghost of a Munch-like sculpture, a herd of boxcar cows — all part of a fanciful sculpture exhibition that local artists have mounted on his 140-acre farm, part of his self-appointed role as a keeper of the spirit of the Hudson Valley past and present.But there wasn’t a sliver of magic yesterday morning at a second-floor courtroom in nearby Philipstown, where — with a legal shuffle here and an official finding of adjournment in contemplation of dismissal there — an ugly animal cruelty case against him seemed on the verge of going away. The gash in the civic spirit here could last a good bit longer.Two months after animal cruelty charges were filed against him, a lot of people are still trying to figure out just what happened when Mr. Saunders, 67, a mainstay of the Hudson Valley environmental community, was arrested on July 18. Officials said they responded to complaints to find horses, sheep and a goat in “shocking” condition: emaciated, with hoof ailments and skin infections, and living in manure in a fetid barn.This struck many people as very odd, since Mr. Saunders’ barn might be the most public one in the region. In the five weeks before the animals were seized, an annual barn dance was held that brought out perhaps 200 people, and a fund-raiser for John Hall, a Democratic candidate for Congress, that 150 people attended. An independent film was shot there. Krista Osborn visited in July with her 2-year old twin daughters. “I have visited dozens of farms over the past seven years with my four children and the Saunders’ farm is one of the cleanest and well maintained I have come across,’’ she later wrote in an open letter in Mr. Saunders’ defense.'"

"'06-09-14,'0','In the past few months alone regional productions in the Northeast have helped restore human dimensions to characters that have traditionally appeared as billboard-size cartoons. They include Alexandra del Lago, the monster movie star from “Sweet Bird of Youth,” portrayed with redemptive self-awareness by Margaret Colin at the Williamstown Theater Festival, and Reverend Shannon, the volcanic alcoholic minister from “Night of Iguana,” rendered with eye-opening feminine passivity by Garret Dillahunt at the Berkshire Theater Festival.Two years ago at the Kennedy Center in Washington, Sally Field found the bone-weariness and loving maternal anxiety in Amanda Wingfield, the child-warping mother from “A Glass Menagerie.” These were all performances that might be called small compared to the bluster of Broadway star turns.Perhaps Broadway, hardly a harbor for subtlety these days, demands an operatic fervor for audiences to feel they have been given their money’s worth. (It’s telling though that Broadway hasn’t seen a great production of a Tennessee Williams play since Trevor Nunn’s staging of “Not About Nightingales” in 1999.)But for those of us who feel Williams is so much more than a sensationalist, the rewards of looking at his characters through a microscope instead of a magnifying class are incalculable. I was never, for example, a great fan of “Summer and Smoke.” First produced in 1948 (and filmed in 1961 with the Method Acting sweetheart Geraldine Page as Alma), this story of the hopeless love of a chaste preacher’s daughter for a big, strong man can smack of the simplistic Freudianism that possessed mainstream American intellectuals in the mid 20th century.Certainly that’s what comes across in Ms. Page’s meticulous film performance of a part she had played, to great acclaim, in a benchmark Off Broadway revival in 1952. Her hands restlessly roving her throat and chest, her voice a tremulous whine, she seemed to invite the frat boy’s classic (and unsavory) prescription for an uptight woman.The dichotomy between spirit (the ethereal Ms. Page) and flesh (embodied by a cold, virile Laurence Harvey as the doctor) was writ so large it glared at you. A Broadway revival in 1996, starring Mary McDonnell and Harry Hamlin, suffered from the same reductionist approach. And in fairness, it’s hard to avoid this sensibility in a play in which a life-size (and visible) human anatomy chart and a statue of an angel named Eternity are the central symbols.Statue and chart are neatly in place in Mr. Wilson’s production, designed with unconfining airiness by Tony Straiges. But for once they don’t dominate the stage. Mr. Wilson is less interested in symbols than in the natural flow of life and the ways it propels people into collision and isolation.The production does not ignore or overcome the schematic melodrama that forces its conclusion. But every character is drawn with sympathy and an awareness of Williams’s vision of human existence, even in a crowd, as a state of unending “solitary confinement.”Williams perceived a baleful, gut-busting humor in this existential joke. And it feels right that in this production, as delivered by Ms. Plummer, Alma’s frequent laughter has a wounded knowingness. This is not genteel tittering, to paper over awkward silences, but something deeper and more spontaneous. You sense the genuine intelligence within Alma’s arty affectations. Just as crucially, you sense a moral confidence that goes deeper than the pious platitudes of her father, Reverend Winemiller (Terry Beaver).A specialist in extreme eccentrics on stage (“Agnes of God”) and screen (“Pulp Fiction”), Ms. Plummer would appear an unlikely candidate for finding the natural woman in Alma. But she underplays beautifully here, emphasizing an outsider’s quiet watchfulness, which lurks behind the strained social facade, and a kindliness toward her fellow outcasts. Not that she’s a saint. This Alma is willful and even harsh in the face of her father’s censoriousness and the childish malice of her mad, useless mother (an appropriately affecting and irritating Jennifer Harmon).You can see why John Buchanan Jr., the hedonistic young doctor Alma has known since their shared childhood, would be attracted to her. John isn’t a fully drawn role, but Mr. Kudisch (best known for Broadway musicals like “Thoroughly Modern Millie” and “Chitty Chitty Bang Bang”) strikes an artful balance between sensual self-indulgence and moral self-disgust.When this Alma and John get together, a current of mutual understanding courses between them, despite the often rancorous tone of their conversation. They complement each other not because they’re such obvious opposites, but because each contains strong, if unacknowledged, elements of the other. They were meant to be together, which in Williams’s world means they never will be.To this production’s credit it makes clear that John is ultimately the more conventional of the pair and destined to lead a more confined, traditional life. In the concluding scene, still a quiet shocker, Alma seems poised to become an outcast of society, rather like her better-known spiritual sister Blanche DuBois of “A Streetcar Named Desire.”The world is a cold and lonely place, and if a lost soul needs the occasional tranquillizer or kindly stranger to make it through the night, who’s going to blame her?As Alma, who says she is always “mystified and amazed” by the unprovoked malice of others, puts it, “Life is such a mysteriously complicated thing that no one should presume to judge and condemn the behavior of anyone else.” These might be the watchwords of everything Williams wrote. How heartening it is to see productions that treat his plays with a similar lack of preconceptions and, yes, a touch of kindness.'"
"'06-09-14,'0','By 5 a.m., the first set of arrays was deployed. The task was done in stages to avoid a problem that NASA called “stiction” (from sticky + friction), which caused a similar set of panels to bang and flap as they were opened the last time a solar array was deployed, in 2000.This time, the arrays were slowly warmed, first by having the station turn so they could bathe in sunlight, and then by unfolding them gradually — , just a little bit at first, then to 49 percent of their full length. They basked in that position for another 30 minutes before the process was completed.As the first set began to stretch out like an accordion, some of the golden panels did stick together briefly, but they popped apart as the sun did its work, causing ripples in the structure but no concern on the ground.By 6:08 a.m., the first set stretched to its full length.“Solar array full deploy,” said Capt. Brent W. Jett Jr. of the Navy, the mission commander, said to controllers on the ground.The unfolding then began on the second set, and again stopped halfway to allow the panels to warm in the sun, resuming at 8:38 a.m. Live coverage on NASA TV showed the panels gently rippling as they unfolded from the “blanket box” that had held the stored array.When the operation was completed successfully, Pam Melroy, an astronaut at mission control communicating with the crew, offered congratulations. “Big day for the space station,” she said.“We’re very happy to get the array out today,” Captain Jett said.Kyle Herring, the commentator for NASA TV, added, “The international space station has a new pair of wings.”The astronauts were awakened by mission control today to the howl of laughter that begins the surf classic “Wipeout” by the Safaris, which was chosen for Christopher J.

"'06-09-14,'0','They saw Alex Rodriguez — remember his August slump? — raise his average to .289 with three hits, including a home run to center field. They saw Hideki Matsui bat again for the second consecutive night as the designated hitter after missing four months with a broken wrist.They saw Robinson Canó drive in five runs with a sacrifice fly in the first inning, a two-run home run in the third and a two-run double in the seventh. Canó’s home run, which put the Yankees up by 6-2, came on a 2-2 pitch from Jason Hammel (0-3).The victory was credited to reliever Brian Bruney, who worked two scoreless innings. Bruney, cut by Arizona, joined the Yankees on Aug. 17. This was his first victory with the team. His earned run average fell to 0.71.“I set goals every day,” Bruney said. “My next goal, long term, is to win a World Series whether I’m on the postseason roster or not.”Rodriguez praised General Manager Brian Cashman for signing Bruney. “I don’t know where he found this guy,” Rodriguez said. “He’s unbelievable.”The victory reduced the Yankees’ number for clinching first place in the American League East to seven. They are 11½ games ahead of the second-place Red Sox, who lost at Baltimore.Jeter extended his streak with a single in the first inning, but his batting average fell one point to .345. He trails Joe Mauer of Minnesota, who leads the A.L. at .348. Jeter’s streak is the longest by a Yankee since Don Mattingly hit in 24 consecutive games in 1986.“You can’t really explain it,” Jeter said of the streak. “You just hope you can ride the wave.”Rodriguez drove in his first run with an infield hit in the first inning that traveled about 40 feet down the third-base line. He drove in his second run in the third on a home run that traveled more than 400 feet. In the seventh, he hit a sharp single.Rodriguez’s home run total of 33 is second on the team behind Jason Giambi’s 36. His R.B.I. total of 110 leads the team, two ahead of Giambi.Lidle fell behind, 2-0, in the first inning on home runs by Rocco Baldelli, leading off, and Carl Crawford, batting third. Although the Yankees gave Lidle a 6-2 lead, he was pulled in the fifth after the Devil Rays closed the gap to 6-4.Torre plans to use four starting pitchers in the playoffs instead of the usual rotation of five. The top three are Chien-Ming Wang, Mike Mussina and Randy Johnson.Matsui had no hits in three at-bats, plus a walk, after going 4 for 4 in his first game back Monday night. Although Matsui has not yet played left field, both he and Torre envision his return.“That’s Matsui’s job,” Torre said. And where does this leave Melky Cabrera, who has filled the position well and began last night’s game with an average of .286? “Melky did a good job filling in for him,” Torre said.The circumstances might be different for Gary Sheffield, the right fielder recovering from a broken wrist, who has been out since May 29. Sheffield took batting practice for the second consecutive day.But Torre seemed in no hurry to rush him back. “Maybe one day, home or on the road, we can simulate a game for him,” Torre said. “We’ll wait a few days to make that decision.”Sheffield, who has a notably violent swing, said he was moving the bat with about 60 percent of his normal energy. “I can swing at 100 percent,” Sheffield said. “I’m just not going to. When they say ‘This is the day you come back,’ then I’ll swing harder.”Sheffield has been replaced by Bobby Abreu, who is batting .338 as a Yankee.'"

"'06-09-14,'0','The defendant, Derrick Walker, had some legitimate employment, but he also received credit for pension and other benefits for work done by other people using his name, one of his Social Security numbers — he had four of them — and union membership, Mr. Castleman said.He received kickbacks from workers using his name, according to the indictment.The men set up minority labor coalitions, one operating out of a Brooklyn storefront, the other out of a car trunk, under the pretext of promoting minority hiring, and demanded $100 to $500 a week in kickbacks from contractors and workers, prosecutors said.In one case, a West Indian construction worker who was an illegal immigrant was forced to kick back $100 a week to one of the rings after it helped him get a job. He was forced to continue paying even after getting another job on his own.According to prosecutors, Mr. Walker and the other three men employed tricks they had learned in prison to organize their extortion schemes. To communicate with one another, prosecutors said, they employed a code used by the Five Percenters, a black militant group that broke from the Nation of Islam in the 1960’s. In this code, called “the supreme mathematics,” certain words correspond to numbers. “Understanding wisdom,” for instance, translates into “32,” code for a .32- caliber pistol, and “power cipher cipher” translates to $500, the amount one contractor had to pay weekly to ensure labor peace.The case began with a complaint from a contractor. Investigators infiltrated both rings with an undercover agent and broke the code by listening to wiretaps and convinced other contractors to cooperate, prosecutors said.During the investigation, prosecutors reimbursed one laborer for his extortion payments, as a way of persuading him to help with the investigation, the authorities said.Legitimate versions of minority labor coalitions exist, prosecutors said, but they are not coercive.Mr. Morgenthau said his office had charged members of unscrupulous coalitions with crimes in the past, but this was the first time it had been able to indict one on enterprise corruption, the state’s version of the federal racketeering act generally used in organized crime cases.It is a type of crime that is hard to crack because the contractors tend to accept it as part of the cost of doing business and do not report it, the district attorney said. One contractor even wrote “extortion” on a check stub. He was, Mr. Morgenthau said, “just being accurate.”The defendants, Mr. Walker, 42, and Frederick Rasberry, 48, whose coalition was called Akbar’s Community Services; and Reginald Rabb, 39, and Steven Mason, 41, who ran P & D Construction Workers, were indicted for enterprise corruption, coercion and grand larceny and face up to 25 years in prison. They pleaded not guilty in Manhattan State Supreme Court yesterday and Justice Edward J. McLaughlin ordered them held without bail.Prosecutors said Mr. Walker supported children in Alabama and North Carolina. His lawyer, Ruth L. Yang, said he was “in shock” at the charges.Some of the extortion schemes were carried out at public works projects like schools, a portion of the city water tunnel in the meatpacking district, and the L train’s Broadway Junction station in East New York, prosecutors said.Asked if his inquiry pointed up lapses in the supervision of government contractors, Mr. Morgenthau responded laconically, “Apparently.”Rose Gill Hearn, the city’s investigation commissioner whose office took part in the inquiry, said in an interview that her office did monitor municipal projects. The Department of Investigation, for example, checked contractors cleaning up ground zero for phantom materials and employees, and challenged $47 million in billing, she said.'"
"'06-09-14,'0','“Adding a milk chocolate version is just a way of expanding sales,” said Bonnie Liebman, nutrition director for the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a public health advocacy group in Washington. “Mars is hoping that people won’t know that there is more evidence for dark chocolate than milk chocolate being good for you.”The introduction of the newest CocoaVia bars, which are to arrive in 500 stores in October, comes as Mars is working to reverse slack chocolate sales and a loss of market share to its chief rival, the Hershey Company. As part of a shakeup of its confectionary business, Mars said Wednesday that it had named a former Del Monte Foods executive, Todd R. Lachman, to head its American snack food unit.United States sales of Mars chocolate products grew by 1.7 percent over the past year, while Hershey’s sales rose by 4.9 percent, according to figures from Information Resources, a research firm, which were provided by Mars. The industry average growth rate was 3.3 percent, according to the research firm.But over the last 12 weeks Mars has seen a turnaround, with chocolate sales up 8.3 percent versus Hershey’s 1.2 percent gain. (The figures do not include sales at Wal-Mart, which account for about half of United States chocolate sales.)Mr. Gamgort attributed the gain to Mars’s strategy of introducing fewer new products than its rivals and focusing instead on “refreshing” its core brands like M&Ms and introducing “real innovation” like CocoaVia.Hershey has had trouble meeting sales targets the last few quarters and has announced that it will cut back on the number of chocolate product offerings. In the last two years, the company introduced Kissables, a candy-covered version of the popular Kisses, and various kinds of Reese’s, including supersize and white chocolate versions.“Hershey has started to realize that they have had diminishing returns for the innovations and have indicated they will take a little bit of a back-to-basics approach,” said Daniel Popowics, an analyst with Fifth Third Asset Management in Cincinnati.Mars’s sales of M&M’s have increased by 11 percent in the last 12 weeks and by 4.5 percent over the past year. The candy had more than $1 billion in sales last year, making it the best-selling chocolate product in the world. Mr. Gamgort credited recent movie promotions, including this summer’s film, “Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man’s Chest,” (“Pirate treasure and white chocolate”), and “Star Wars: Episode III — Revenge of the Sith” (“Come to the dark side”), which came out last year, for bolstering sales.“A year ago, we were taking some hits and we felt like we were the lone voice saying, ‘Let’s get the balance right in the categories,’ ” Mr. Gamgort said. “And those predictions have come true.”Mars’s Dove category is the company’s fastest-growing, with sales growth of 73 percent in the last 12 weeks and 33 percent over the last year. About half of Dove sales are of dark-chocolate products. The Dove category, which had sales of about $150 million last year, is the highest-selling chocolate brand in China, Mr. Gamgort said.But when it comes to CocoaVia, Mars realized it needed to be patient with the brand “because it is an entirely new category,” Mr. Gamgort said. And so it is introducing milk chocolate bars with almonds and covered raisins, and a new “rich chocolate indulgence” drink.The new chocolate bars all have 5 milligrams of cholesterol versus none in the original versions and up to 21 grams of sugar, compared with no more than 9 in originals. The newer versions also have calories ranging from 110 to 150, up from the 80 to 140 in the originals.'"
"'06-09-14,'0','Among those switching sides was George Cardenas, an alderman who said Mr. Daley had sought his support. In a statement, Mr. Cardenas said he had looked at Mayor Daley’s “track record” in the city and decided to change his vote, noting in particular items that he said Mayor Daley had “delivered” in his community — three new schools, a library, a renovated park and more.Meanwhile, faced with the possibility of mandatory wage rates for its Chicago workers, national chains also fought the wage bill through a combination of threats and behind-the-scenes lobbying.Target said it would halt planned stores while it waited to see if the ordinance became law. Representatives of Wal-Mart, which expects to open its first Chicago store soon, took a softer approach, meeting with more than half of the city’s 50 aldermen over the last nine months to trumpet its hourly wages, health care benefits and low prices.But a threat of lost revenue, jobs and growth was implicit. John Bisio, a senior public relations manager at Wal-Mart and its point man on the Chicago wage bill, said the retailer had made it clear that the legislation created a situation that would make it hard to invest in Chicago.Explaining why she switched sides and opposed the wage rules, Alderman Shirley Coleman told The Chicago Tribune that Wal-Mart had “expressed strong interest in building” in her ward.Gerard C. Dehrmann, director of media relations for the Midwest region at Wal-Mart, said the retailer “has had conversations with numerous aldermen about stores in their ward, but we have never promised a store for a vote.” He said he was unaware of any meeting in which Wal-Mart discussed building a store in Ms. Coleman’s ward.As it has in the past when controversy loomed, Wal-Mart relied on local suppliers, rather than just company officials, to speak on its behalf. Several small businesses that do work for the company spoke out against the bill at neighborhood meetings and news conferences.On the Council, supporters of the measure said they considered it a groundbreaking step nationally in requiring businesses to improve pay. But opponents said they feared the move would simply send stores to the suburbs, away from some of the neighborhoods most desperate for jobs, and questioned whether the rule would survive court challenges when it singles out companies with more than $1 billion in annual sales and stores of at least 90,000 square feet.In recent weeks, race became a high-profile element of the debate, with some of the city’s minority leaders disagreeing over whether it was more important to ensure reasonable wages for workers or to lure businesses to their communities. Some black business leaders accused union leaders of erecting barriers to big-box retailers in the city, but not in the largely white suburbs.As divisions over the issue boiled over into yelling matches between members of the audience in the chambers on Wednesday, some supporters of the wage rules loudly pledged that they would oppose aldermen who had changed their votes during elections in 2007. Others said they would oppose Mayor Daley, who is up for re-election next year. Regardless, labor and religious leaders said, they will bring the issue back nationally as well as in Chicago.Alderman Joe Moore, who led efforts to pass the wage rule, promised a revised proposal for it as early as at the Council’s next meeting. “This issue will not go away,” he said.'"
"'06-09-14,'0','SAN FRANCISCO, Sept. 13 — A solitary computer hacker has entangled Microsoft in a high-stakes battle of wits by repeatedly releasing a free program that strips away the software lock that the company created to protect digital movies and songs from being freely copied by Internet users.While Microsoft has publicly sought to portray the David vs. Goliath contest as a nuisance, the affair escalated to become a genuine challenge to one of the company’s significant businesses this week after the BSkyB, the British satellite broadcaster, suspended its film download service amid fears of illegal copying.The Microsoft system is designed to prohibit Internet users from making illegal copies of movies or songs played in Windows Media 9 or 10 formats. It is used by digital content distributors that include BSkyB, Movielink, RealNetworks and MTV’s Urge music subscription service.In July, the computer programmer, who calls himself Viodentia in Internet postings, released an online tool to remove copy protection from movie and song files. It was a refinement of an existing program, making it easier to use. The program, he stressed, was intended only to enable purchasers of digital media to exercise so-called fair use rights in copying material they had already acquired.Since then, it has been downloaded tens of thousands of times.The cat-and-mouse game began on Aug. 19 when Viodentia released a first version of his program on a series of Web sites around the world. Nine days later, Microsoft responded by patching its system to prevent the hacker’s tool, called FairUse4WM, from working. But within three days a new version of the code-breaking program was circulating, sending Microsoft’s programmers back to the drawing board.'"
"'06-09-14,'0','Nintendo’s Wii (pronounced we) is less technically ambitious than Sony’s PS3, which is why it will cost far less and be far more available in stores this holiday season. To market the Wii, Nintendo hopes to make up in innovation and accessibility what the machine lacks in sheer silicon horsepower.Nintendo is No. 3 in the console video game market, behind Sony and Microsoft. But while those competitors have largely focused on appealing to hard-core gamers, Nintendo is now trying to appeal to a broader audience.“Our goal is to bring gaming back to the masses,” Reggie Fils-Aime, president and chief operating officer of Nintendo of America, said in a telephone interview. “You see that in our pricing, you see that in the number of units we plan to make available this year and you see that in how we are positioning the Wii to appeal to every member of the household, including but not limited to the hard-core gamer.”The Wii’s major innovation is a wireless controller that the user can tilt and point to produce action on the screen. In a sword-fighting game, for instance, the player can simply swing the controller to thrust and parry with an on-screen blade; there is no need to master the complicated combinations of buttons and triggers that make many video games so intimidating to the reflex-challenged.Nintendo intends to announce today that every Wii will come with a game compilation called Wii Sports — including tennis, golf, baseball and bowling — meant to show off the machine’s intuitive controls. (Most consoles, including Nintendo’s GameCube, do not come with games included.)Nintendo plans to say that 25 to 30 top-tier games will be available for the Wii this year. The most-anticipated game comes from Nintendo itself: an installment of the long-running Legend of Zelda series, Twilight Princess. Nintendo will also deliver a driving game called Excite Truck this year, but will provide a minor disappointment to gamers in saying the next version of the popular Mario franchise will not arrive until 2007. Nintendo intends to charge $50 for its Wii games, $10 less than the standard price for Xbox 360 titles and the same price generally charged for GameCube games.Top games expected to be introduced for the Wii this year from third-party publishers include a version of Madden pro football from Electronic Arts, the sword-fighting game Red Steel from Ubisoft of France, an addition to the Sonic action series from Sega of Japan and a Tony Hawk action-sports game from Activision.While Nintendo is certainly counting on the success of top-tier games sold at retail, many gamers may be at least as excited by the Wii’s Virtual Console, which will allow players to download versions of older Nintendo games from the Internet.Nintendo plans to announce today that about 30 classic games will be available for download when the Wii is released, including ones from the Zelda, Mario and Donkey Kong franchises. Downloadable games will cost about $5 to $10 each.More broadly, Nintendo hopes to make the Wii a living-room centerpiece by including various media channels meant to appeal to and draw in people who do not consider themselves gamers. There will be a photo channel that will allow users to use the Wii to display digital photographs on television. There also will be an easy-to-use interactive news channel and weather channel.Perhaps most intriguing, the Wii will make it possible to browse the Web on the television. Microsoft’s Xbox 360 does not permit this because that could negate the need to buy a Windows PC.“We are including all of these capabilities as part of our overall strategy to expand the gaming market,” Mr. Fils-Aime said. “Broadening the market is important because it will breathe new life into this business. Otherwise, this industry is moving down a path of being more and more limited to the hard-core gamer. We value the hard-core player, but the future of our industry has to be in reaching out to new audiences. We think we have the tools and the strategy to do that.”'"
"'06-09-14,'0','The Taxi and Limousine Commission is to begin considering today a plan that would increase taxi fares by as much as 11 percent, as well as the creation of a flat fare of $45 from Manhattan to Kennedy Airport, to mirror the fare for trips in the opposite direction, the commission chairman said yesterday.The taxi fare was last raised, by 26 percent, in May 2004 after eight years without a change.Matthew W. Daus, the chairman of the commission, said the plan was part of a strategy to institute moderate increases every few years. The idea is to keep the taxi industry on a sound financial footing while avoiding very large fare increases.The commission now aims to “keep our eye on the fare so that we can make the changes not in one fell swoop, but over time in a more equitable way,” Mr. Daus said.He said that drivers were still being “adequately compensated” under the 2004 increase, but that an analysis of the fare structure showed that the so-called wait time fare, charged when a cab is sitting in traffic, is far below the rate in other major cities. New York’s rate is 20 cents a minute, while no other major city has a wait time rate below 33 cents a minute, he said.That can result in unpredictable fluctuations in drivers’ income on days when they get caught repeatedly in heavy traffic, he said.'"
"'06-09-14,'0','Without prompting from reporters, Arrington took bemused exception.“I am playing within the framework of the defensive scheme,” he said. “And it just so happens I didn’t make any huge plays. But I was not quiet as a church mouse.”Besides adding Arrington, who was credited with four tackles in his Giants debut, the team shuffled defensive tackles and added three players in the secondary.The performance was solid but was undone by a few critical flaws. As Coughlin described, every bright note had a grim retort. The Giants held the Colts to two touchdowns and forced them to kick four field goals. But they allowed the Colts to convert 11 of 16 third downs, including 9 of 11 in the first half.The Giants said they felt they won two of every three plays. It was not good enough.“If you look at film, it goes win, win, loss; win, win, loss,” linebacker Antonio Pierce said. “The loss is always on third down.”The Giants were 21st in the N.F.L. in third-down defense last season, and the deficiency is the one thing they most want to correct against the Eagles.Most frustrating for the Giants was the sense that Indianapolis was toying with them. On the game’s first drive, the Colts converted four third downs, all by gaining a yard more than was needed. On third-and-6, they got 7. On third-and-1, they got 2. On third-and-13, they got 14. And on third-and-5, they got 6.“It’s definitely demoralizing to let them get 1 yard past the sticks every time they need to,” defensive tackle Barry Cofield said.But Colts quarterback Peyton Manning was often hurried and was forced into several poor throws. The Giants are expected to have one of the league’s best pass rushes, but only tackle Fred Robbins managed a sack. The rebuilt secondary had one interception but dropped at least two good chances.“If the ball hits you in the hands and the chest area, you ought to catch the ball,” Coughlin said.The Giants allowed only 55 yards rushing, usually a bellwether for success. But with their reliance on Manning’s arm, the Colts’ devotion to the run was half-spirited. The Eagles feature a larger offensive line and more of an established running back in Brian Westbrook.“It’s going to be a whole different approach, just a downhill, smash-mouth running attack this week,” Cofield said.What it all means for the Giants’ defense is unclear, and it may be that way for several weeks, until a true pattern emerges. But one game did not change the attitude of the previous months. In the locker room, there remained a sense of optimism that the defense would be good. It remains built largely on faith.“I think we as a defense probably had the most daunting task of any defense going into the first week of the N.F.L. season,” Arrington said. “That’s a plus and a minus. It’s a minus because we lost. But it’s a plus that we have confidence. We played fairly well, we played solid, we know what we needed to do to get better. You take that confidence into the next game.”Even then, they will not know for sure if they are good, bad or somewhere in between. But they will know more.Guard Chris Snee (ankle) and tight end Jeremy Shockey (ankle) did not practice Wednesday. Snee was listed on the injury report as questionable, and Shockey was probable.'"
"'06-09-14,'0','Legislation will be introduced to ensure that the London Stock Exchange will continue to benefit from Britain’s “light touch” approach to regulation if it is taken over, the treasury minister said yesterday.The minister, Ed Balls, said in a speech to business leaders in Hong Kong that the government was neutral on the nationality of exchange owners, but wanted to make sure any new owner of the exchange retained the openness to investment that has been a crucial part of London’s success as a financial center.The London Stock Exchange, Europe’s biggest stock market, has spurned a succession of bid approaches over the last two years.But its most recent suitor, Nasdaq, has built up a 25 percent stake in the business, raising concern that some of the more onerous regulations in the United States, like the reporting requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, might be applied to companies listed on the London exchange.Mr. Balls said the new legislation would strengthen the hand of the British regulator, the Financial Services Authority, to ensure that could not happen.“The issue was that if you had a foreign owner and that owner’s home regulator starts exporting its rules to London, then the F.S.A. would be able to not let that happen,” he said.“It will outlaw the imposition of any rules that might endanger the light touch, risk-based regulatory regime that underpins London’s success,” he said, adding that the government remained blind to who owned the exchanges. It was just concerned how they were regulated.'"
"'06-09-14,'0','The iPod Nano has been refined, too. The original model was shiny and gorgeous. But its high-gloss surface was so delicate, pocket lint could scratch it.That won’t be a problem with the new Nano. Its body is now wrapped in high-luster, textured aluminum, like the old iPod Mini. It’s even a hair smaller and lighter than the old Nano (3.5 by 1.6 by 0.3 inches), and comes in a choice of five colors: silver, blue, pink, green or black. Prices range from $150 (2 gigabytes, silver only) to $250 (8 gigabytes, black only). The battery now plays music for at least 24 hours, which ought to cover your morning jog.The Nano looks, feels and sounds fantastic, and it’s a huge relief not to have to worry about nicking its precious skin anymore. Note, however, that the Nano’s new streamlined packaging is too small for a CD with the iTunes software; you’re supposed to download your own copy from Apple’s Web site.The “big” iPod, the one containing a hard drive and capable of playing videos, got a smaller upgrade. It comes in two models, for $250 or $350 (30 or 80 gigabytes), which is $50 off the previous models (30 and 60 gigabytes). You can crank the screen 60 percent brighter than before. And Apple now sells nine slick iPod video games for $5 each (Pac-Man lives!).The big iPod’s battery can play music for 20 hours, or, more significantly, play video for 6.5 hours. That’s enough juice to play three movies, all the way across the country on a plane. You’d be hard-pressed to find another video or DVD player or laptop that can manage that, at least without add-on batteries.On all of the iPods, Apple has done away with those easy-to-lose foam-rubber earbud mittens. Now the earbuds are ringed with rubber, which is supposed to form a better seal with your ear. Most people will find that the new earbuds sound better as a result. (Audiophiles will continue to sniff disdainfully.)In giving an extreme makeover to iTunes, its free music and video jukebox software for Mac or Windows, Apple began by plucking off a few long-standing thorns. The screen layout is far less busy now. New headings divide the list of music sources into three chunks: Library, Store and Playlists.Another annoyance gone: now iTunes (and the iPod) can play back live recordings seamlessly, without software-induced gaps between the “tracks.” Fans of classical music, opera and Pink Floyd, this one’s for you.The new iTunes can also, for the first time, import music from the iPod, at least under one circumstance. Suppose you’ve bought a couple of songs while on the road. How do you get them from your laptop onto your main machine at home?The iPod can now act as an intelligent go-between. When you connect it to Computer B, iTunes offers to import the store-bought songs that originally came from Computer A (though not the rest of its collection). Very nice.Other goodies include a download start/stop window, automatic downloading of album cover art for songs that you haven’t bought online, and a browsing view that lets you flip through 3-D CD covers as though they’re in a music store bin. Once Apple addresses the bugs that are being reported online, this program will truly rock.The third unveiling was no surprise to Apple rumor fans: the iTunes Store (no longer the iTunes Music Store) has begun selling full-length Hollywood movies.Of course, CinemaNow, Movielink and, as of last week, Amazon.com are already in that business. But, presumably because of the movie studios’ insane, self-defeating restrictions, shopping at those stores is generally a nightmare. The selection is terrible: only 1,100 movies at Movielink, for example (compared with 60,000 rental DVD’s from Netflix) ). The pricing is random and nonsensical; many Amazon movies on DVD actually cost less than the downloadable versions. And the rules are complicated and inconsistent; some movies you can own, while others must be “rented” and played within 24 hours.The movie-download business, in short, is a frustrating mess — precisely where the music-download business was in 2003 when Apple came along and showed the world how it should be done.Once again, Apple’s service is far simpler, better-looking and more consistent than its rivals’. Movies are incredibly easy to find, browse, preview, download and play back on your computer or iPod. Each movie consumes about one or two gigabytes and takes 60 to 90 minutes to download, although you can begin watching after only about three minutes. The movies even come with embedded chapter markers, just as on a DVD; you can skip to the next scene by pressing the iPod’s >> button.The resolution is 640 by 480, precisely the same as that on a standard-definition TV. Most movies come in wide-screen format, however, so you lose some of those 480 vertical pixels to black letterbox bars. Even so, the movies look spectacular on the iPod’s squarish screen, where you can opt for letterbox or full-screen presentation. (The fabled wide-screen iPod has not yet appeared.)Playback on a TV (for example, when connected to the computer or the iPod’s optional video dock) is exactly what Apple says it is: near, but not quite, DVD quality.But even Apple’s store offers only 75 movies, all from Disney and its divisions. And the pricing isn’t as simple as it is for songs or TV shows: old movies cost $10, new movies cost $13 for the first week after their release but then go up to $15. Furthermore, Apple’s definition of “new release” can be quirky; “The Incredibles,” released on DVD nearly 18 months ago, still goes for $13.Much, therefore, depends on Apple’s ability to persuade other movie companies to join. Of course, its successful TV-show store also began with only a small Disney selection; Apple predicts that the movie experiment will likewise blossom in coming months.Still, you’re entitled to ask: Who, exactly, is interested in movie downloads at all? Compared with DVD’s, movie downloads offer limited selection, very little savings, no DVD extras and no surround sound. The files are huge, the quality isn’t even up to DVD standards, and you can’t play your movies on a friend’s TV or a DVD player in the car.Above all, how many families gather ’round the computer on movie night?Apple’s fourth announcement this week addresses that last problem. It’s a $300 box, called the iTV for now and scheduled for release early next year. It’s designed to connect to your TV (with HDMI or component jacks) and play — without wires — all of the movies, videos, photos and music that sit on your Mac or PC elsewhere in the house.There are advantages to downloading your movies, like immediacy and convenience. It’s nice, too, that your movies play in several places at once (on up to five computers and unlimited iPods), which isn’t possible with a DVD. Over all, though, it may take quite awhile for movie downloads — even Apple’s — to go mainstream.Apple’s digital music system is another story. You can resent Apple all you want, you can call its admirers fanboys, and you can gripe that songs from iTunes don’t work on any pocket player except the iPod.What you can’t do, however, is find a better online music store, or a free jukebox program as powerful and clean as iTunes. And you certainly won’t find a music player that beats the new iPods in polish, capacity or even price. They come dazzlingly close to perfection.'"
"'06-09-14,'0','Stop-motion animation — shooting a movie one frame at a time, making subtle adjustments between each shot to simulate movement — has inspired plenty of quirky productions, from the “Robot Chicken” series on the Cartoon Network to the “Wallace & Gromit” films from Britain. Aspiring animators on a budget may want to take a look at the latest version of Adobe’s video editing program, Adobe Premiere Elements 3.0.The software, announced this week and arriving in stores soon, includes a stop-motion video capture function that lets you flow a series of single shots together into one big moving picture. When snapping individual frames from a connected Webcam, for example, the program provides you with a somewhat transparent image of your last shot on the screen so you can better judge the movements of the action figure, clay model or whatever else you’re animating.Adobe has also announced the release of Photoshop Elements 5.0, the newest version of its home-use photo editing and organizing software. The programs cost about $100 each, but they can be purchased together for $150; details are at www.adobe.com. For auteurs who like to mix still and video editing, the programs play nicely together, too. J. D. BIERSDORFER'"
"'06-09-14,'0','“Believe me, it was a lot cooler in the 80’s.” That was Steve Albini, the singer and guitarist and engineer (he hates to be called a producer), onstage in Chicago on Saturday night. The occasion was a reunion of his gloriously abrasive band Big Black. And the occasion for that was the 25th anniversary of Touch and Go Records, the beloved punk and indie label.Big Black’s four-song set was swiftly YouTubed. (Thanks to that Web site, everything can be famous within 15 minutes.) And so Mr. Albini’s onstage comments swiftly became part of his legend. “You can tell it’s not something that we had a burning desire to do,” he said, explaining that he felt obliged to help celebrate the Touch and Go legacy: “Touch and Go is the best thing that happened to music in my lifetime, and we did this to say thanks.” Then, after one more disclaimer — “That’s about as mushy as I’m going to get” — the band launched into a version of “Racer X,” the last song of the set. It sounds pretty thunderous, even as a low-fidelity YouTube video.The (brief) return of Big Black is only the latest in a series of punkish reunions and revisitings that might once have seemed unlikely but now seem inevitable. Last weekend’s Touch and Go celebration also included reunion performances from the woozy Texas post-punk band Scratch Acid and the Detroit hardcore band Negative Approach. And none of these reunions drew much criticism. Over the last few years beloved grass-roots bands ranging from the Germs to Dinosaur Jr. to Gorilla Biscuits have been reunited or reconstituted. Bands and fans are learning a lesson that should have been obvious all along: rock ’n’ roll nostalgia isn’t just for arena bands.As you can tell from Mr. Albini’s comments, some mixed feelings remain. If he’s conscious of the way “history talks about rock music,” then maybe he’s also nervous about how history will judge the four-song reunion; certainly he has talked, in earlier interviews, about not wanting to besmirch Big Black’s legacy. (The band released its final album in 1987.) What, exactly, was cooler in the 1980’s? Big Black concerts? (Certainly; the live album “Pigpile” offers proof.) Music? The world?The language of nostalgia usually sounds ridiculous, which is why so many punk and post-punk bands tried to tug in the other direction. Few tugged harder than Nation of Ulysses, a stylish and tricky hardcore band signed to Dischord, the do-it-yourself record label based in Washington. (Dischord has a legacy, and a reputation, to match Touch and Go’s.)Nation of Ulysses spent four and a half years, from 1988 to 1992, making a brilliant racket and issuing fanciful but severe manifestos proclaiming the band to be a revolutionary youth group.

"'06-09-14,'0','“It’s the only French museum that covers the whole sweep of French history,” its director, Béatrice Salmon, said, noting that the collection starts in the Middle Ages and ends with today’s design. “Its aim is to promote French industry, French art de vivre and French savoir-faire.”It also has elegantly refurbished quarters to match that ambition.Its location in the 19th-century Marsan Wing of the Louvre Palace along the Rue de Rivoli has not changed since the museum opened in 1905. But the removal of a mezzanine now brings natural light into its soaring main gallery from a glass roof five floors above, while newly opened windows offer panoramic views of the rest of the Louvre and the Tuileries Gardens.The museum’s display — some 6,000 items from its 150,000-piece collection — has also been reorganized along broadly chronological lines, albeit with pauses for special features, like galleries on the “arts” of resting and eating, as well as the toy section and a room of paintings donated in the 1960’s by Jean Dubuffet.Among the highlights are 10 beautifully recreated period rooms peppered throughout the museum. Organized by the designer François-Joseph Graf, they give visitors an almost voyeuristic look inside the homes — O.K., the castles and mansions — of French aristocrats and wealthy bourgeois from the late 15th to the early 20th century.What the rooms also illustrate is how, while individual artists in Italy and northern Europe were already famous by the time of Renaissance, little is known about the weavers, carpenters, silversmiths and potters who created the tapestries, furnishings and tableware for privileged homes before the 19th century. Unlike Piero della Francesca and Dürer, they are anonymous.Does this mean that the decorative arts are — or were — somehow inferior to painting and sculpture?These are dangerous waters. In terms of offering the creator both immediate prestige and a place in posterity, for a long time painters and sculptors won out. Yet, if judged by how they enhanced the image and social standing of the homeowner, craftsmen were undoubtedly of immense value.Then, as industrialization facilitated production, the designer appeared between the artist and the craftsman. He was more concerned with creating a style than an individual object; and he was sought out by the wealthy as a kind of guarantor of good taste. Soon, as he does today, he came to enjoy as many kudos as many leading artists.Thus around 1880 Eugène Grasset was invited by his friend the art collector Charles Gillot to design an elaborate dining room, which is one of the period rooms here. Entered through a stained-glass door, it is peopled with ornamental figures, animals and plants. The creators of these objects are not identified. The room, as such, is “signed” by Grasset.But the designer could not trump the patron. One striking period suite comprises a boudoir, bedroom and bathroom designed in the early 1920’s by Albert-Armand Rateau for the prominent couturier Jeanne Lanvin. The rooms are discreetly furnished in an Art Deco style, with the walls of the bedroom and boudoir covered in blue silk. And they are known as the Lanvin — not the Rateau — rooms.More of a showpiece for Art Deco is an office-library in the round designed by Pierre Chareau for the French Embassy pavilion at the 1925 Paris International Exhibition. It contains Chareau’s original chair and black desk, but its most distinguishing feature is a domed ceiling with a leaflike wooden mechanism that reveals or hides book shelves.In the rest of the collection there is a similar passage from objects of historical importance to designs carrying famous names. The oldest pieces are religious paintings and ornate retables, works which could easily be in the Louvre but here underline the early blurring between public and domestic art. Soon, though, the focus turns to the home, from beds and tables to ceramics and glass.The sophistication of the objects increases as cabinetmakers add mosaic inlays and porcelain absorbs Chinese influence. Wood paneling in turn became an art in itself, later replaced by silk and eventually by beautifully painted wallpaper. These features are also well illustrated in various period rooms.But from the late 19th century on, names take over: Charles Christofle was followed by René Lalique as jewelers to the rich; Hector Guimard was an influential Art Nouveau architect; Art Deco made the names of Robert Mallet-Stevens as well as of Rateau; and early Le Corbusier represents the Bauhaus. Philippe Starck, France’s most famous designer today, completes the litany of stars.Perhaps unsurprisingly, then, it was the emergence of decorative arts as an industry that inspired the creation of the Musée des Arts Décoratifs in 1905. And, unusually for France, it was founded as — and remains — a privately run museum, which answers to patrons, collectors and industrialists.The government financed 60 percent of the cost of its recent renovation, but a private association called Les Arts Décoratifs owns its collection. The association also operates the adjacent Musée de la Mode et du Textile and the Musée de la Publicité, as well as the Musée Nissim Comondo, formerly a private mansion, in the city’s Eighth Arrondissement.With this week’s reopening of the Musée des Arts Décoratifs, the association is once again assuming its patriotic role of promoting France as the ultimate arbiter of style, taste and luxury. Lovers of the decorative arts naturally have good reason to celebrate, but this is serious business. And the museum has a new gift shop and restaurant to prove it.'"
"'06-09-14,'0','Neighborhood pride ties together “From Mambo to Hip-Hop: A South Bronx Tale,” a documentary being shown tonight in New York at 9 on WNET as part of the “Voces” series on Latin Americans.“From Mambo to Hip-Hop” dances through the history of a borough that nurtured two musical movements: the mambo that evolved into salsa, and the hip-hop that arose from the most desperate days of the South Bronx. Produced by Elena Martinez and Steve Zeitlin, who are principals in the New York folklore group City Lore, and directed by Henry Chalfant, a longtime chronicler of the South Bronx who collaborated on the early-1980’s documentary “Style Wars,” “From Mambo” rushes by, driven by rhythms that change through the decades.Mambo and hip-hop are the kind of melting-pot phenomena that New York heats and stirs. Their roots are African, refracted through the Caribbean and the city. In their beginnings both styles also reflected, and defied, the ghetto status and economic deterioration of the South Bronx.Mambo was visceral, sophisticated music that emerged after World War II as Cuban styles were picked up by Puerto Ricans who mingled with jazz musicians, and the Bronx became a night life mecca. The groundbreaking big band led by Machito was named the Afro-Cubans, flaunting the fact that its musicians were black, and it traded ideas with the era’s beboppers.The documentary has exultant vintage segments from the 1950’s heyday of mambo with musicians and especially dancers who shook everything from head to toe while conga drums and timbales crackled with Cuban rhythms and New York aggression. A younger generation of musicians — now elders, like Eddie Palmieri and Ray Barretto (who died in February), who are interviewed — met playing stickball and grew up on mambo, going on to streamline and sharpen it into salsa.“Salsa could have only happened in New York and in a place like the Bronx because of the diversity of the people that were playing it,” explains Willie Colón, the bandleader who has become a political figure in the Bronx. “It’s an inclusion and a reconciliation of all the things that we are here, and the Bronx, and the music that we made together. We not only wanted to make music; we had a goal. We wanted to convey a social and political message, and salsa was very important for that because it was our voice.”'"

"'06-09-14,'0','FRANKFURT, Sept. 13 (AP) — Authorities searched the Swiss home of the former Tour de France winner Jan Ullrich on Wednesday, as well as nine other homes and offices of people suspected of involvement in a Spanish doping scandal.A statement by Germany’s Federal Crime Office did not say whose homes or offices had been searched. But Ullrich’s manager, Wolfgang Strohband, confirmed that his and Ullrich’s homes had been raided.Ullrich, who is on his honeymoon, was not at home during the raid, Strohband said.The headquarters of Ullrich’s former T-Mobile team in Bonn were also searched. “We were of course cooperative,” a team spokesman, Christian Frommert, said.The searches, both in Germany and abroad, were part of the fraud investigation by prosecutors in connection with the investigation of the Spanish doctor Eufemiano Fuentes.Five people in Spain — including Fuentes and another doctor, José Luis Merino Batres — were arrested and charged in May when the police seized drugs and frozen blood at a Madrid clinic. The samples were thought to have been prepared for performance-enhancing transfusions.Nine riders, including Ullrich, Ivan Basso and Francisco Mancebo, were forced to withdraw before the start of this year’s Tour de France because of alleged ties to Fuentes.'"
"'06-09-14,'0','A leader’s first job is to project authority, and George Bush certainly does that. In a 90-minute interview with a few columnists in the Oval Office on Tuesday, Bush swallowed up the room, crouching forward to energetically make a point or spreading his arms wide to illustrate the scope of his ideas — always projecting confidence and intensity.He opened the session by declaring, “Let me just first tell you that I’ve never been more convinced that the decisions I made are the right decisions,” and he grew more self-assured from there. I interview politicians for a living, and every time I brush against Bush I’m reminded that this guy is different. There’s none of that hunger for approval that is common to the breed. This is the most inner-directed man on the globe.The other striking feature of his conversation is that he possesses an unusual perception of time. Washington, and modern life in general, encourages people to think in the short term. But Bush, who stands aloof, thinks in long durations.“I got into politics initially because I wanted to help change a culture,” he says, referring to his campaign against the instant gratifications of the 1960’s counterculture. And he sees his efforts today as a series of long, gradual cultural transformations. Like many executives, he believes that the higher you go, the further into the future you should see, and so his conversation is filled with speculations about the long-term effects of deep social trends — the current religious awakening or the politics of volunteer armies.All of which prepares him to think about the war on terror as a generations-long struggle. He asked us to think about what the world could look like 50 years from now, with Islamic radicals either controlling the world’s oil supply or not. “I firmly believe that some day American presidents will be looking back at this period in time, saying, ‘Thank goodness they saw the vision,’ ” he said.'"

"'06-09-15,'1','The fact that Mr. Murdoch is contemplating such a move both suggested that his view of the prospects for DirecTV had dimmed, and underscored the lengths he would consider to end a standoff with Mr. Malone’s Liberty Media Corporation.For Mr. Malone, gaining control of DirecTV would be the latest twist in a long and tortured relationship between the media moguls. He had contemplated bidding against Mr. Murdoch for DirecTV. More recently, he revamped Liberty by issuing tracking stocks and bringing in Gregory Maffei as chief executive to push forward his strategy of turning Liberty into less of a passive investor and more of an operating business.Owning a large stake in DirecTV might allow Mr. Malone to recapture some of the market power he held when he controlled the nation’s largest cable company, Tele-Communications Inc., which he sold in 1998.Liberty was created as the programming arm of Tele-Communications, using the relationship to gain access to homes for cable channels in which Liberty owned stakes.Mr. Malone has said he regrets selling the cable business, but it is unclear how he would tackle some of DirecTV’s issues including its lack of its own broadband Internet offering.Two people close to the talks said any deal would be complicated. In addition to trading Liberty’s stake in News Corporation for its stake in DirecTV, the transaction would also have to involve cash and an operating asset News Corporation has owned for more than five years to give Mr. Malone the tax advantage he seeks.Liberty is the largest shareholder after Mr. Murdoch in the News Corporation. The accumulation of that stake and the threat that Mr. Malone could use it to challenge Mr. Murdoch’s control led News Corporation to enact a contentious poison pill a couple of years ago.As a settlement in a lawsuit brought by other investors against the validity of the pill, News Corporation has agreed to put the pill to a vote at its annual meeting on Oct. 20. Mr. Maffei said in a previous interview, “I can’t see much logic in us voting for a pill that restricts our flexibility.”Mr. Malone has said he is willing to consider swapping Liberty’s stake in the company for operating assets in a way that limits the tax he would have to pay.He and Mr. Murdoch had previously discussed deals involving other News Corporation interests including its stake in the National Geographic Channel and TV stations.'"

"'06-09-15,'1','WASHINGTON, Sept. 14 — The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee plans to pour hundreds of thousands of dollars into an advertising campaign trying to unseat John Sweeney, a Republican congressman from upstate New York, Democratic officials said on Thursday.The move comes after some Democrats argued that national party leaders were making a mistake in New York, a heavily Democratic state, by failing to more aggressively support the woman challenging Mr. Sweeney, of the Albany area, and a handful of other candidates facing Republican incumbents.Only a few months ago, Democrats predicted they would pick up as many as four seats, possibly even five, in New York’s Congressional delegation. But those hopes have dimmed, as Democratic candidates in New York have struggled to gain traction against Republican lawmakers, who seemed to benefit from district lines drawn to keep incumbents in power.The shifting fortunes of New York Democrats seemed to be reflected in the decisions being made by national party strategists, who until now had set aside money for only one Congressional race in New York.That race, in District 24 in the Utica area, is for the seat being vacated by Representative Sherwood L. Boehlert, one of the most liberal Republicans in Congress, who is retiring. Democrats believe the battle to replace him is their best shot at capturing a Republican seat in New York. The party needs 15 seats to take control of the House, and party leaders are turning their attention to the most competitive races, given their limited resources.But on Wednesday, national party leaders moved to reserve broadcast time for $500,000 worth of campaign advertising in Mr. Sweeney’s district after internal party polls showed the congressman’s support among likely voters at a mere 43 percent, with his opponent 12 points behind, according to Democrats monitoring the race.But Republicans quickly questioned the move’s importance, noting that the House Democrats’ re-election committee had reserved advertising time only in the Albany area — and had not actually bought any time. Maureen O’Brien Donovan, a spokeswoman for the Sweeney campaign, said it amounted to a political feint intended to confer legitimacy to the campaign of Mr. Sweeney’s challenger, Kirsten Gillibrand, after a recent poll released by the Siena Research Institute showed Mr. Sweeney with a 19-point lead.'"
"'06-09-15,'1','The paper reported that Scott C. Smith, president of the Tribune Publishing division, had asked the paper’s executives to come up with a plan for trimming their budgets, but when Mr. Smith visited Los Angeles late last month, they had produced no such plan.Mr. Baquet “made his opposition to further cuts clear and said there was no need for further discussion,” the paper reported.A spokesman for Mr. Baquet and Mr. Johnson said they would have no further comment.Mr. Smith said in a statement: “In this rapidly changing media environment, we are all working together to best serve our communities, customers and shareholders.”It is rare for an editor to go public with a position on internal budget battles and for the editor’s own newspaper to report on it. The decision by The Los Angeles Times to take its battle against Tribune public may signal that Mr. Baquet is trying to rally support on the paper’s behalf, at a time when Tribune is in turmoil and some local businessmen have expressed interest in buying the paper.An editor at the paper said the article was prompted by a letter on Tuesday from 20 civic leaders, who called on Tribune to put more money into the paper or consider selling it. A Tribune spokesman said the company would respond to the letter in the near future.The showdown is a dramatic example of a long-simmering conflict between many newsrooms and boardrooms around the country as newspapers face an industrywide economic slump and continued demands by Wall Street for improved financial results.The stock prices of most public newspaper companies have been flagging for about two years, yet many of their publications remain profitable. The Los Angeles Times reported that its operating profit margin was 20 percent, higher than that of the average Fortune 500 company.Many papers, including The New York Times and The Washington Post, as well as other Tribune properties — among them Newsday, The Sun of Baltimore and The Hartford Courant — have announced buyouts and job cuts over the last year. Newspaper costs, particularly for newsprint and personnel, are outstripping revenues and the Internet is siphoning off readers and advertisers.The Belo Corporation announced yesterday that 111 newsroom employees at The Dallas Morning News had taken buyout offers, leaving 450 editorial employees to retrench and focus mainly on local news. Last month, David Black, whose Black Press is the new owner of The Akron Beacon Journal, laid off 40 editorial employees, about 25 percent of the newsroom staff.At The Los Angeles Times, circulation has been falling from its peak of 1.2 million in 1990. For the six months that ended in March, it was 851,500, down 5.4 percent from the period a year ago. It was the biggest drop among the top 10 dailies and more than twice the industry average.Tribune has been in particular turmoil because of a conflict in recent months with the Chandler family, its largest shareholder, over management of the company, which includes 11 daily newspapers and 25 broadcast television stations. The Chandlers have said the company, in which The Los Angeles Times is the biggest business, is mismanaged and have called for the company to sell its assets.The Tribune board has defended management and has been in talks with the Chandlers to try to iron out their differences. The company said earlier this year that it would buy back $2 billion worth of company stock and make $200 million in cost cuts companywide over the next two years. It has sold some television stations, and announced a deal yesterday to sell its station in Boston, but it has not specified where it will find the bulk of those savings.The statements in yesterday’s Los Angeles Times seemed a declaration that Tribune would not find much of those savings in Los Angeles — or it could lose its top executives.John S. Carroll, the paper’s previous editor, quit last year in part because of pressure from Tribune to cut costs. Mr. Baquet, a close friend of Mr. Carroll and his heir apparent, had threatened to quit then, too, but stayed on.“Have I had disagreements with Chicago and others about the paper?” Mr. Baquet told his paper at the time. “Sure. But obviously I feel like I am in sync enough with the people who own the joint” to have accepted the editor’s job.Several staff members said the stance that Mr. Baquet was taking now, with support from Mr. Johnson, had given the newsroom a morale boost.“Johnson comes out from Chicago and goes native,” said Steve Lopez, a columnist for the paper. “He’s had a stiff drink of the Dean Baquet Kool-Aid and he’s on the team.”He said many in the newsroom thought Tribune would be reluctant to fire the editor and the publisher because doing so could bring further embarrassment and spell chaos for the already troubled company. But it is not clear how the company will respond.“Tribune isn’t shy or sentimental,” said Martin Kaplan, associate dean of the Annenberg School for Communication at the University of Southern California. “My guess is that they don’t want to be backed into a corner.”'"
"'06-09-15,'1','The chairman and vice chairman of The New York Times Company announced yesterday that they would forgo all their stock compensation, both direct grants and options, for the next two years to create an estimated $2 million annual pool for bonuses to employees.Arthur Sulzberger Jr., the chairman and publisher of The New York Times newspaper, and his cousin, Michael Golden, the vice chairman and publisher of The International Herald Tribune, said in a note to the staff that their decision was “a purely personal one.”Earlier generations of their family sacrificed to see the company through difficult times, their statement said. “Now it is our turn.”The bonus pool will be distributed among the company’s holdings, based on their size. While the specific grants will be determined by senior managers of the various business units, all the money will go to employees who are not currently eligible to participate in the company’s annual bonus plan, according to yesterday’s executive statement.In 2005, according to the company’s proxy statement, Mr. Sulzberger’s salary and bonus totaled $1.6 million; he also received a restricted stock grant that was valued at $817,500 and options on 150,000 additional shares, as part of his long-term compensation.Mr. Golden’s salary and bonus last year totaled slightly more than $842,000; he received options on 60,000 shares, and his restricted stock grant was valued at $327,000.Wall Street pessimism over the growth prospects for all newspaper publishing companies, given the potential impact of the Internet on advertising and circulation revenues, has battered the industry’s share prices over the last three years. But the company’s publicly traded shares have fared worse than its peers.'"
"'06-09-15,'1','By focusing on the sharing of music, Microsoft hopes to differentiate its device from the industry-leading iPod, which has no wireless or sharing features.Bryan Lee, corporate vice president of Microsoft’s entertainment business, said in an interview that the company saw digital music sharing as an extension of other social technologies like MySpace and XBox Live, Microsoft’s online game technology that connects players with one another.“It turns people into street teams,” (promoters who try to popularize music through word of mouth), Mr. Lee said.Microsoft declined to be more specific about the timing of the Zune’s introduction and did not reveal its price, saying only that it would be competitive with that of other music players. The various iPod models cost $79 to $349.Microsoft’s announcement came two days after Apple said it would sell full-length movies for download to PC’s and video iPods, and announced iPod models with more storage space and a lower starting price.The Zune will be able to play video files and songs in the MP3 format, along with music and video bought through a new service called Zune Marketplace. That service will also have a subscription plan, though Microsoft executives declined to give pricing details. The device will not play content bought from the iTunes Music Store of Apple.The Zune, which is being manufactured by Toshiba, will have 30 gigabytes of memory, an FM radio tuner and a 3-inch screen, larger than the iPod’s 2.5-inch screen. The Zune will come in white, black and brown, but additional colors and configurations are expected to arrive next year.The player will come with some music already on it, including songs by artists on Virgin Records and EMI Music’s Astralwerks. Last week, Microsoft flew the writers of several popular music blogs to Seattle and showed them the Zune, in what it said was an effort to help spread the word among music fans and prove that music lovers like to communicate.Analysts say Microsoft’s battle for the music player market will not be easy. With a five-year head start, Apple has built a market share of more than 75 percent in the United States, according to the latest figures from the NPD Group, a market research company. Microsoft previously focused on licensing its software to manufacturers of portable players.But Microsoft may have its sights set further out in the future. Microsoft executives, including Bill Gates, the chairman, have predicted that people will eventually listen to music through their phones. And a Microsoft executive told reporters yesterday that a Zune phone was part of the company’s plan for the product line.“Taking on the iPod with a standalone music device is going to be hard, but Microsoft has to in order to be positioned for the future MP3-cellphone-e-mail-camera device,” said James L. McQuivey, a technology expert and a professor in the College of Communication at Boston University. “The fun has just begun.”'"
"'06-09-15,'1','Retail sales rose 0.2 percent in August after a surge of 1.4 percent in July, the Commerce Department reported yesterday. Another report showed that weekly first-time claims for jobless benefits declined.The economy is approaching the fourth quarter with its expansion modest but continuing. The recent slide in home sales and a degree of inflation represent challenges to Federal Reserve policy makers, who are expected to keep interest rates unchanged for a second month when they meet this coming Wednesday.“Fears about the consumer falling apart are so far not founded,” said Joel Naroff, president of Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pa. “The Fed is still likely to do nothing next week, and continue to pause.”The rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee ended a two-year run of increases in short-term rates at its August gathering.A Bloomberg News survey of 79 economists had forecast that retail sales would decline 0.2 percent. Countering the optimism from this stronger data, some traders noted that growth in retail sales excluding autos was 0.2 percent, less than estimates of 0.3 percent.Another Commerce Department report showed that inventories at businesses rose in July, matching an increase in sales, suggesting that companies kept stocking up on goods in anticipation of strong demand. An increase of 0.6 percent in the value of unsold goods at factories, retailers and wholesalers followed an upward-revised 0.9 percent gain in June.'"
"'06-09-15,'1','But then what? When they want to leave, do they just close up shop? They could pass it on to the next generation, but if it’s big enough — say Blackstone or even Fortress — the next generation can’t afford it. They could sell to a big financial institution, as when J. P. Morgan Chase bought Highbridge Capital in 2004. But few banks seem to share J. P. Morgan’s appetite for multi-billion-dollar hedge funds.Going public solves succession and retention issues while creating a more permanent institution. Several major private equity and hedge funds have also contemplated going public, including the Citadel Investment Group, a $12 billion hedge fund in Chicago and the private equity firms Kohlberg Kravis & Roberts & Company and the Blackstone Group.Kohlberg Kravis has gone further than its private equity rivals and put its toe into public markets: in May it sold shares in an affiliate that trades in Amsterdam on the Euronext exchange. Investors bought shares in the $5 billion fund, which entitled them to a piece of the profits Kohlberg Kravis makes buying and selling companies. But the offering also allowed Kohlberg Kravis to keep the management company under control, holding on to its privacy and secrecy.Fortress, however, is contemplating something radically different: floating its own business rather than the funds it manages. That means allowing investors to buy into the enormous stream of fees earned by the investment adviser as well as the incentive compensation.The Man Group, a London-based hedge fund first went public as a commodities broker with hedge fund operations. Today it is the largest hedge fund group in the world with $54 billion in assets under management and $1.2 billion in profits for its 2006 fiscal year. Other funds have imitated Kohlberg Kravis by taking funds public, using the money to invest. But no one in the United States has undertaken what Fortress is considering: taking the central nervous system of a hedge fund public.Fortress is not a typical hedge fund. It manages $24.3 billion and has 500 employees, according to its marketing materials. It calls itself a “global alternative investment and asset management firm.” The description seems apt, considering its size and the fact that it has offices in London, Rome, Frankfurt, Geneva, Tokyo, Hong Kong, Sydney, Toronto, Dallas and San Diego.The firm is a prime example of convergence in asset management: it operates private equity and hedge funds and it competes against banks to lend money directly to corporate clients. The result is a firm with various lines of business that looks more like Goldman Sachs than a traditional hedge fund.The firm has $11.1 billion in private equity. Since 1994, its five principals have invested in 77 private equity transactions representing more than $55 billion of assets, according to its marketing materials.It operates about $10 billion in hedge funds that invest in everything from global stocks and currencies to fixed income, or debt-related securities; it also has $3.2 billion in dividend-paying companies. Drawbridge Global Macro, one of its hedge funds, has had an annual return of 14.6 percent since it was founded in May 2002, according to the HSBC Private Banking Report. Annualized returns on its private equity funds top 40 percent, according to a person familiar with the returns.There are some big disadvantages to being a public company. For one, public companies are heavily regulated with significant disclosure requirements. Hedge funds have resisted such disclosure.There is also the issue of structure: hedge funds are generally run by an investment adviser that manages money for individuals and institutions. Hedge funds generally charge investors a management fee of 1 to 2 percent and a performance fee of 20 to 25 percent of profits. Different products at Fortress will have different fee structures, but 2 percent of $24.3 billion is $486 million, and managers make a lot of money.Fortress may not pull off an offering. Until August, the stock market was treacherous and it is unclear whether there is enough investor appetite for new offerings.Its bankers have to come up with a valuation, a notable challenge considering how little precedent exists and how many pieces to the puzzle exist. (Of course, Goldman Sachs is a public company and many people still wonder how they make money.)The bankers and principals will also have to determine how much of the company to take public. Ideally for investors, the stake would be relatively small in order to make sure management continues to have a direct incentive to perform.Then there is the issue of whether it is valued like an asset management company, which typically carries a price-to-earnings ratio of 20, or more like a broker with a price-to-earnings ratio of 8 to 10.A person knowledgeable about hedge fund valuations said it would be a mix: the income from management fees would be valued at the higher multiple, as with an asset manager, and the performance income would be valued less as it is more volatile, closer to the low end of the brokers.Regardless of the price — and expect the underwriters to go for gold since it is the first one — the deal reflects the stark reality that the hedge fund industry, once a niche and secretive, is quickly changing.Assets in hedge funds have increased 3,000 percent since 1990 with almost 9,000 funds now entrusted with $1.2 trillion of capital. Once a playground for the rich, hedge funds now have institutional investors, like pension funds and endowments.That has translated to some transparency and the realization by managers that they do not need to produce 30 percent returns with huge swings, but rather 8 to 10 percent returns without the roller coaster ride.The game has shifted to gathering assets, making fees from managing those assets and contemplating once-heretical moves like going public. The question, until now, has simply been who would go first. Fortress may be the first to let the drawbridge down.'"
"'06-09-15,'1','Previously, no script had been associated unambiguously with the Olmec culture, which flourished along the Gulf of Mexico in Veracruz and Tabasco well before the Zapotec and Maya people rose to prominence elsewhere in the region. Until now, the Olmec were known mainly for the colossal stone heads they sculptured and displayed at monumental buildings in their ruling cities.The stone was discovered by María del Carmen Rodríguez of the National Institute of Anthropology and History of Mexico and Ponciano Ortíz of Veracruz University. The archaeologists, a married couple, are the lead authors of the report of the discovery, which is being published today in the journal Science.The signs incised on the 26-pound stone, the researchers said in the report, “link the Olmec to literacy, document an unsuspected writing system and reveal a new complexity to this civilization.”Noting that the text “conforms to all expectations of writing,” the researchers wrote that the sequences of signs reflected “patterns of language, with the probable presence of syntax and language-dependent word orders.”Several paired sequences of signs, scholars said, have even prompted speculation that the text contained poetic couplets.Experts who have examined the Olmec symbols said they would need many more examples before they could hope to read what is written on the stone. They said it appeared that the symbols in the inscription were unrelated to later Mesoamerican scripts, suggesting that this Olmec writing might have been practiced for only a few generations and never spread to surrounding cultures.Stephen D. Houston of Brown University, a co-author of the report and an authority on ancient writings, acknowledged that the apparent singularity of the script was a puzzle and would probably be emphasized by some scholars who question the influence of the Olmec on the course of later Mesoamerican cultures.But Dr. Houston said the discovery “could be the beginning of a new era of focus on the Olmec civilization.”Other participants in the research include Michael D. Coe of Yale; Richard A. Diehl of the University of Alabama; Karl A. Taube of the University of California, Riverside; and Alfredo Delgado Calderón, also of the National Institute of Anthropology and History.Mesoamerican researchers not involved in the discovery agreed that the signs appeared to represent a true script and that their appearance could be expected to inspire more intensive exploration of the Olmec past. The civilization emerged about 1200 B.C. and virtually disappeared around 400 B.C.In an accompanying article in Science, Mary Pohl, an anthropologist at Florida State University who has excavated Olmec ruins, was quoted as saying, “This is an exciting discovery of great significance.”A few other researchers were skeptical of the inscription’s date because the stone was uncovered in a gravel quarry where it and other artifacts were jumbled and possibly out of their original context.The discovery team said that ceramic shards, clay figurines and other broken artifacts accompanying the stone appeared to be from a phase of Olmec culture ending about 900 B.C. They conceded, though, that the disarray at the site made it impossible to determine if the stone was in a place relating to the governing elite or a religious ceremony.Dr. Diehl, a specialist in Olmec research, said, “My colleagues and I are absolutely convinced the stone is authentic.”Road builders digging gravel came across the stone in debris from an ancient mound at Cascajal, a place the discoverers said was in the “Olmec heartland.” The village is on an island in southern Veracruz and about a mile from the ruins of San Lorenzo, the site of the dominant Olmec city from 1200 B.C. to 900 B.C.That was in 1999, and Dr. Rodríguez and Dr. Ortíz were called in, and they quickly recognized the potential importance of the find.Only after years of further excavations, in which they hoped to find more writing specimens, and comparative analysis with Olmec iconography did the two invite other Mesoamerican scholars to join the study. After a few reports in recent years of Olmec “writing” that failed to hold up, the team decided earlier this year that the Cascajal stone, as it is being called, was the real thing.The tiny, delicate signs are incised on a block of soft serpentine stone 14 inches long, 8 inches wide and 5 inches thick. The inscription is on the stone’s concave top surface.Dr. Houston, who was a leader in the decipherment of Maya writing, examined the stone with an eye to clues that this was true writing and not just iconography unrelated to a language. He said in an interview that he had detected regular patterns and order suggesting “a text segmented into what almost look like sentences, with clear beginnings and clear endings.”Some pictographic signs were frequently repeated, Dr. Houston said, particularly ones that looked like an insect or a lizard. He suspected that these were signs alerting the reader to the use of words that sound alike but have different meanings — as in the difference in English of “I” and “eye.”All in all, Dr. Houston concluded, “the linear sequencing, the regularity of signs, the clear patterns of ordering, they tell me this is writing, but we don’t know what it says.”'"
"'06-09-15,'1','The simplest and most reliable way to get discount tickets to Broadway and Off Broadway shows is the TKTS booth, which is situated temporarily in the ground-floor plaza of the Marriott Marquis Hotel, between 45th and 46th Streets and Seventh and Eighth Avenues.The booth is scheduled to return to Father Duffy Square, with a significant makeover, by the end of the year.Tickets go on sale at the booth for evening performances at 3 p.m. and for matinees at 10 a.m. The Theater Development Fund, the nonprofit group that operates TKTS, adds a $3 fee to each ticket, but no other fees apply. Cash or travelers checks only.There is also a TKTS annex at the South Street Seaport, at Front and John Streets. It is open 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. Monday to Saturday, and 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. on Sunday. Tickets for matinees are sold the day before the show.To qualify as a member of the Theater Development Fund and receive other discounts — some much more than 50 percent — you must be a student, teacher, civil servant, performing arts professional, employee at a nonprofit organization, member of the armed forces or the clergy, or be 62 or older, and have documentation to prove it. The annual fee is $25. Information and an application: tdf.org.Some ticket services offer greater markdowns, but with bigger up-front charges.

"'06-09-15,'1','There is no question that shareholders who sell to the company have reason to be happy. The remaining shareholders, however, may see it differently. To them, buybacks should be good news if the price turns out to be low, and bad news if the price is high. In other words, shares should be viewed like any other asset.Measuring that performance is not as easy as it might be. The accounting rules provide that companies should not record profits or losses on transactions in their own shares, so a buy high-sell low strategy does not affect reported profits.Dell’s record as a market timer is poor. It got so enthusiastic in 1999 and 2000, when the stock price was soaring in the technology bubble, that it not only bought back a lot of stock but also entered into complicated options transactions that committed it to buy shares in the future at prices that now seem very high.The result was that in 2001 and 2002, when the stock price was in the tank, Dell was committed to buying shares not at the newly discounted price, but at the old price it contracted for when it entered into the options deals. The result: In the fiscal year that ended in January 2003, Dell’s average cost of share repurchases was $45.80 a share, even though the shares never traded as high as $32 during the entire year.That embarrassed the company, and late in that fiscal year it bought its way out of the contracts. It probably would have done better to hold on, because the stock did well in the next year. That merely reinforced Dell’s reputation for bad market timing.But by last year, its confidence was back. Dell shares were trading in the high $30’s, and sometimes topped $40. The company plowed $7.2 billion into share repurchases — more than twice its net income — only to see its business go into decline, taking the stock price with it. Yesterday, it closed at $21.61.In the first two quarters of the current fiscal year, it spent at a slower rate, in large part because the price was down. And now it has, at least temporarily, halted purchases.The money here is very real, by the way. During the last eight full fiscal years, Dell reported net income of $17.9 billion — and it spent $24.1 billion buying back stock.Some of those repurchases went to reducing the share count. But most of them were purchased simply to offset the dilution caused by executives and employees cashing in stock options. I estimate that to buy the 491 million shares Dell issued for options over that period, it spent $10 billion more than it received from the options holders.Those who oppose treating the value of options as an expense argue that no cash changes hands, and that the fair accounting treatment is to reduce earnings per share through the dilution that comes from more shares being outstanding. But, as Dell’s history shows, that ignores the cash cost from offsetting the dilution by repurchasing shares.There have been companies that did wonders for their investors by repurchasing shares, as Teledyne did in the 1960’s and 1970’s under the direction of Henry E. Singleton. But he was also a brilliant investor who understood values. And unlike many current executives, he was not selling his own stock while the company was buying.Unfortunately, many corporate boards are subject to the same emotional swings that affect investors. In good times, there is plenty of cash and they are willing to buy stock at high prices. When times get tough, the price falls and they cut back. That is a recipe for buy high-sell low.Even if the accounting hides the results, that is never a good policy.'"

"'06-09-16,'0','“This enemy has struck us, and they want to strike us again,” Mr. Bush said, “and we’ll give our folks the tools necessary to protect the country. It’s a debate that, that really is going to define whether or not we can protect ourselves.”It was also a debate Mr. Bush had hoped to have this week exclusively with Democrats as he and his party’s leadership set out to draw unflattering distinctions between Republicans and Democrats on fighting terrorism for the fall elections.Instead, Mr. Bush spent Friday in a second day of heavy debate, casting some of the most respected voices on military matters in his own party as hindering the fight against terrorism. As of late Friday there seemed to be no break in the impasse, even as White House officials worked behind the scenes to build new support in the Senate for the legislation the president wants.Leading the efforts against him in the Senate are three key Republicans on the Armed Services Committee with their own military credentials: the chairman and a former secretary of the Navy, Senator John W. Warner of Virginia; Senator John McCain of Arizona, a prisoner of war in Vietnam; and Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, a military judge. And publicly taking their side is Mr. Bush’s former secretary of state, Colin L. Powell.The dispute centers on whether to pass legislation reinterpreting a provision of the Geneva Conventions known as Common Article 3 that bars “outrages upon personal dignity”; the Supreme Court ruled that the provision applies to terrorism suspects. Mr. Bush argued that the convention’s language was too vague and is proposing legislation to clarify the provisions. “What does that mean, ‘outrages upon human dignity’?” he said at one point.Mr. McCain and his allies on the committee say reinterpreting the Geneva Conventions would open the door to rogue governments to interpret them as they see fit.In a statement late Friday, Mr. McCain stuck to his position, saying that his proposed rules included legal protections for interrogators. “Weakening the Geneva protections is not only unnecessary, but would set an example to other countries, with less respect for basic human rights, that they could issue their own legislative reinterpretations,” he said.Mr. Bush rejected the crux of Mr. McCain’s argument when a reporter asked him how he would react if nations like Iran or North Korea “roughed up” American soldiers under the guise of their own interpretations of Common Article 3.“You can give a hypothetical about North Korea or any other country,” Mr. Bush said, casting the question as steeped in moral relativism. “The point is that the program is not going to go forward if our professionals do not have clarity in the law.”He also discounted an argument made in a letter from Mr. Powell that his plan would encourage the world to “doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism.”Asked about that analysis, Mr. Bush said, “If there’s any comparison between the compassion and decency of the American people and the terrorist tactics of extremists, it’s flawed logic.”Mr. Bush was alternately combative and comedic during the hourlong session with reporters. At one point, in describing how he thought the economy and Republican tax policies would help his party in November, he said: “I’ve always felt the economy is a determinate issue, if not the determinate issue in campaigns. We’ve had a little history of that in our family, you might remember.”It was an off-hand reference to his father’s losing presidential re-election campaign in 1992, when he was damaged by economic woes and the breaking of his “read my lips” vow not to raise taxes.Mr. Bush said it was “urban myth” that his administration had lost focus on capturing Osama bin Laden. The president said he was frustrated by the United Nations at times, especially when it came to addressing genocide in Darfur.Asked about a Senate report concluding that there was no working relationship between Saddam Hussein and Al Qaeda in Iraq, Mr. Bush said forcefully, “I never said there was an operational relationship.”The questioner had included a reference to Mr. Bush’s Aug. 21 news conference at which he had said, “Imagine a world in which you had Saddam Hussein who had the capacity to make a weapon of mass destruction, who was paying suiciders to kill innocent life, who would — who had relations with Zarqawi,” referring to the Qaeda mastermind in Iraq, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi.Democrats for the most part on Friday were content to allow Republicans to fight among themselves on the terrorism question.“When conservative military men like John McCain, John Warner, Lindsey Graham and Colin Powell stand up to the president, it shows how wrong and isolated the White House is,” said Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York, chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee.But Republicans boasted that their top issue, terrorism, was dominating the political news for yet another day and overtaking Democratic criticisms of the war in Iraq.'"
"'06-09-16,'0','There are potential pitfalls on the horizon. A steeper decline in housing prices could slam the brakes on consumer spending and curtail economic growth.But, so far, while the pace of consumer spending has slowed, it is by no means plummeting.“Supply and demand are more balanced now,” said Steven Wieting, an economist at Citigroup.For months, the economy has been poised between competing forces pulling in different directions.The economy has slackened, slowed by higher interest rates and a weakening housing market. Yet despite slower growth, energy prices continued to push inflation higher. Wages, which have inched up consistently over the last year, have threatened to put additional pressure on prices.Indeed, the index of core prices, the gauge most closely watched by the Fed, which excludes the unstable prices of food and energy to provide an indication of underlying inflation, rose 2.8 percent in August compared with the year before, the fastest annual pace since November 2001.The economic tug of war left the Fed and its chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, in a tight spot. Having increased interest rates by 0.25 percent at each of 17 consecutive meetings since June 2004, the Fed decided last month against tightening monetary policy more.But with core price inflation still way above Mr. Bernanke’s stated “comfort zone” of 1 to 2 percent, many economists said they were worried that the Fed had stopped too soon.If the 1 to 2 percent range “is a credible forecast, the Fed has to do something about it,” said Allan H. Meltzer, a professor of political economy and public policy at Carnegie Mellon University. “We are certainly not moving towards 1 to 2 percent inflation.”Jeffrey M. Lacker, governor of the Federal Reserve Bank of Virginia, took the unusual step of dissenting, voting against the decision to stop increasing rates at the Fed meeting last month.The more benign inflation figures in August appear to support the Fed’s stance. Mr. Wieting said energy prices in the price index should also fall steeply in September. That is because the August data referred to prices midmonth and thus missed most of the recent fall in the price of gas, which declined by 30 cents a gallon, to $2.67, from Aug. 21 to Sept. 11.Falling gasoline prices are also affecting inflation expectations. According to the University of Michigan’s preliminary reading of consumer sentiment, reported yesterday, expectations of inflation one year ahead declined to 3.1 percent from 3.8 percent a month ago.Core prices are not likely to follow energy prices down immediately. But they have been moderating. August was the second consecutive month in which core prices rose 0.2 percent, following three months of 0.3 percent inflation. And some prices that have perked up recently will probably abate. For instance, rising clothes prices, which also bolstered core inflation, are mostly a result of the arrival of more expensive fall fashions.Rents have also played a big role pushing up prices. The National Association of Realtors expects apartment rents in urban complexes to rise 4.8 percent this year, up from 2.9 percent in 2005. The shelter component in the Consumer Price Index, which makes up more than 40 percent of the core, rose 0.2 percent in August, pushed mostly by higher rents.Some economists argue, however, that rents should moderate eventually, because many condos that were built during the housing boom are now sitting unsold and will probably be converted into rental units.And the moderating viewpoint is consistent with other data. Industrial production declined by 0.1 percent in August, according to another government report. Slowing output should ease inflation pressures.“One of the components of inflation has been commodity prices across the board, from energy to metals,” said Thomas J. Duesterberg, president and chief executive of the Manufacturers Alliance/MAPI. “We are starting to see some moderation in these prices. That’s consistent with the moderation of industrial demand.”The economic outlook could yet become bleaker. People who bought their homes using adjustable-rate mortgages to keep their monthly payments low are starting to see higher mortgage bills. Some are falling behind on their payments.And many economists suspect that home prices are still likely to fall more steeply. This could decimate residential construction. And it could impair American consumers’ ability to borrow and, therefore, to spend.“There’s a storm building there,” said Dean Baker, co-director of the Center for Economic Policy Research in Washington.But if so, it is further away on the horizon.'"
"'06-09-16,'0','UNITED NATIONS, Sept. 15 — Secretary General Kofi Annan reversed course on Friday and said he would file a new financial disclosure form. Although completing the form is not mandatory in his case, his top aides considered it advisable to avoid misunderstanding.“He has nothing to hide and does not want to cause embarrassment to the organization or to himself, so he has decided to voluntarily submit a financial disclosure form to the U.N. ethics office,” Mark Malloch Brown, the deputy secretary general, said in an interview on Friday night.Mr. Malloch Brown said that Mr. Annan had communicated the decision to him on the telephone from Havana, where he was attending the conference of nonaligned nations.“His lawyers had clearly advised him that he both does not need to sign the form and indeed that he might be imprudent to do so because he would be tying the hands of his successor,” Mr. Malloch Brown said.

"'06-09-16,'0','“It is certainly disappointing for that have all to have been a waste and unnecessary exercise,” said Kevin Harner of the Rocky Mountain Rescue Group.In the first days of the search, Corporal Hering’s mother, Elynne, wore a T-shirt with the Marine motto “Semper Fi” as she combed the mountains. She later collapsed from dehydration and exhaustion.Mr. Powers also joined the searchers, with many risking their lives.Days after the search ended, Mr. Powers confessed to detectives that it had all been a set-up to help Corporal Hering avoid returning to Iraq. Mr. Powers, a student at the University of Colorado here, was charged with false reporting, a misdemeanor.Calls to Mr. Powers’s lawyer were not returned, and his father, answering a call to his house, said his son was not answering questions.Corporal Hering’s parents now say that they do not know what to believe and that they fear that their son may be a victim of foul play.“There is no shred of evidence at all to confirm this man’s new story,” Mr. Hering said of Mr. Powers’s confession. “It may be as completely false as the lies he told us all for 10 days.”Lloyd Hering is a Vietnam veteran, and the corporal’s brother Brendan, 23, who flew in to join the search, is in the Air Force. The family has repeatedly said that Corporal Hering, who is due back at Camp Pendleton, Calif., on Monday, is a proud marine who would not flee.“His parents have one perspective,” the Boulder County sheriff’s commander of detectives, Phil West, said. “A couple of people have come forward saying that Lance thought it would be cool to stage his own death and go live in a foreign country under an assumed name.”Commander West said Corporal Hering’s access to $2,000 that he owed his parents and his criminal record were red flags. In 2004, Corporal Hering and Mr. Powers were caught trying to break into a store. They were given deferred sentences for the felony charges, but they have now violated their probation.Commander West said the authorities would seek restitution for the more than $10,000 that the search cost.Corporal Hering could face legal trouble with the Marines on charges of lying on his application — he did not mention his arrest — and desertion if he does not return to his base on time.On Tuesday, Corporal Hering’s parents returned to the rocks and rushing river of Eldorado Canyon to ask the public to help find their son.“Our heartfelt thanks to the hundreds of volunteers,” Lloyd Hering said. “We now know lots of places where Lance is not.”'"
"'06-09-16,'0','Last year, organic milk sales increased by 25 percent from the year before and Mr. Hartman predicts that Wal-Mart’s brand could lift annual growth to as much as 35 percent. Currently, organic dairy represents 3.5 percent of all dairy products sold in the United States, according to the Organic Trade Association.The organic milk Wal-Mart is selling under its own label comes from Aurora Organic Dairy, which also supplies Safeway, Costco, Target and Wild Oats with their store brands of organic milk. But Wal-Mart’s entry into the market stirs greater attention from critics.Activist groups, as well as some organic food retailers and dairies, contend that the company where Wal-Mart and the other big retailers get their milk operates large factory farms that are diluting the principles of organic agriculture and delivering customers a substandard product. They argue that Aurora’s cows do not spend any significant time roaming pastures and eating fresh grass; instead they live on a diet high in grains.“They are trying to cut corners in the interest of producing milk as cheaply as possible,” said Mark Kastel, senior farm analyst at the Cornucopia Institute, which represents organic family farmers.Wal-Mart and its supplier say that those allegations are misleading and that Aurora’s two farms in Colorado and Texas are in full compliance with Agriculture Department standards for organic dairy.Executives at Aurora, which is based in Boulder, Colo., acknowledge that their farms, with 4,000 cows in Platteville, Colo., and 3,300 in Dublin, Tex., are among the largest organic dairy operations in the country. But they say their animals are healthy and contented and that the company’s organic milk is of the highest quality.Wal-Mart’s buying power is certainly cutting the cost of its organic milk. An informal survey of organic milk at Denver area grocery stores found that Wal-Mart’s label was 8 percent to 35 percent cheaper than other brands. At Wal-Mart, it was selling for an average of 10 percent less than Horizon Organic milk, the brand Wal-Mart has been carrying for three years.The controversy turns on how closely Aurora adheres to the principles behind the organic food movement. Many organic farmers say grass feeding is essential for organic dairy production because it is part of a cow’s natural behavior. Milk from grass-fed cows, they say, is also higher in beneficial fatty acids than milk from cows fed grain, making it more nutritious.At Aurora’s Platteville operation, about 40 miles north of downtown Denver, 4,000 cows are put on grass only when not being milked or when they are nearing the end of a lactation cycle. That totals about two to three months a year. The rest of the time they stay in dirt-lined outdoor pens where they eat from an ample trough filled with a mixture of hay, silage, corn and soybeans.Clark F. Driftmier, head of marketing at Aurora, said the company planned to reduce the number of cows in Platteville to 1,000 by next summer so all the animals could graze. In addition, he said, the number of acres of pasture at the Texas farm will triple by next spring.The company, he added, is opening a 3,200-cow dairy farm in Kersey, Colo., that has been designed to allow for year-round daily access to pasture. Mr. Driftmier acknowledges these changes are being made partly in anticipation of the Agriculture Department’s plans to tighten rules requiring more grazing for milk to be called organic.Mr. Kastel of Cornucopia calls Aurora’s efforts “greenwashing.” He says the farm’s acreage per cow will still be low and that the company is overtaxing its animals by milking them three times a day instead of twice, which is the norm at organic farms.John Mackay, chief executive of Whole Foods Market, the nation’s largest organic food supermarket chain, toured Aurora’s Platteville farm in May with Margaret Wittenberg, vice president for quality standards. They found it to be “unacceptable” and “not up to our standards,” said a spokeswoman, Ashley Hawkins.While a 4,000-cow farm is not large among conventional dairies, which can hold as many as 25,000 cows, it dwarfs most organic farms. Jim Riddle, organic outreach coordinator for the University of Minnesota and former chairman of the National Organic Standards Board, said that putting thousands of cows on pasture is almost impossible.Wal-Mart would not say how much it was paying Aurora for its milk and whether that price was lower than the typical $26 per hundred pounds of milk that most organic dairy farmers get. But on its Web site, Aurora boasts that it is one of the lowest-cost producers of organic milk in the country, in part because the Platteville farm has a milking plant on site.Because Aurora milks its cows three times a day and feeds its animals diets of calorie-dense grains, its milk production per cow is also higher than that of other organic milk producers. In Platteville, Aurora’s annual milk output per cow is 20,000 pounds, according to the company, whereas most organic dairies get 14,000 to 18,000 pounds per cow, Mr. Kastel says.Mr. Driftmier at Aurora says that grass feeding should not be the only measure of animal health and well-being. “Our record of animal welfare is certified by an independent third-party expert,” he said. “Our animals are outside all year long; they’re never locked into barns.”In accordance with organic standards, Aurora cows also get no hormones or antibiotics and all their feed is grown organically.Many in the organic industry, however, say that Wal-Mart, in its push to move organics into the mainstream, could do more than simply search for the biggest and lowest-cost producer in the market.Mr. Riddle, the organic coordinator, points to subsidy programs that dairy companies like Organic Valley, Horizon Organic and Stonyfield Farms are operating to help small and midsize dairy farmers move to organic methods. “These programs are going to help alleviate the organic milk shortage by next year,” he said. “But you can’t increase the supply overnight or place orders and have them immediately filled. Organic takes time.’’'"
"'06-09-16,'0','In Brussels on Friday, European Union foreign ministers agreed to support a new Palestinian government, but heeded American warnings that it was too early to abandon the aid restrictions before a new government was formed and its platform published.On Thursday, Mr. Haniya accused the United States of undermining efforts to form the new government and called on Europe to take the lead in lifting international sanctions against the Palestinians. “The U.S. administration does not want the Palestinians to be unified,” Mr. Haniya said. “It puts obstacles in the way of this political coming together. It wants to extort the Palestinian people and the Palestinian government.”Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, in a meeting on Wednesday with the Israeli foreign minister, Tzipi Livni, said that the United States would insist on the three conditions, including an explicit recognition of Israel’s right to exist, as agreed upon by the “quartet” of the United States, European Union, Russia and the United Nations that had been trying to promote peace negotiations.Hamas will not do that, its leaders say, but is trying to draw a distinction between a political platform designed for a coalition government and the beliefs of the Hamas movement itself.Still, Mr. Haniya and Mr. Abbas have been appealing to European anxieties about the severe economic depression that the cutoff in funding and aid has produced in the Palestinian territories, and in particular in Gaza, which the United Nations has called “a ticking time bomb.”United Nations agencies have sharply increased their aid, including basic foodstuffs, to prevent malnutrition in Gaza, where 40 percent of the work force is employed by the Palestinian Authority and has received less than two months’ salary in the last seven months.The Europeans want to end the stalemate and use the conclusion of the war in Lebanon as a springboard to renewed Israeli-Palestinian talks. Some European countries want to restore the aid in stages, after specific benchmarks are met, like an end to rocket attacks on Israel.But the Europeans are split. The external relations commissioner of the European Union, Benita Ferrero-Waldner, said that it should show flexibility provided that a new government “reflected” the three demands. “It is clear we want to be firm on principles, but we should be flexible about the form this government chooses in the text,” she said.The Slovenian foreign minister, Dimitrij Rupel, told reporters: “We are happy about the government of national unity. We are trying to help it, also financially.”But such a government does not yet exist, as Britain’s minister for Europe, Geoff Hoon, pointed out, saying that “there is still some further clarification as to precisely what is the underlying agreement involving Hamas.”Ben Bot, the Dutch foreign minister, said that support depended on meeting the three demands. Asked about the prospects, he said, “So far not very positive, I must say.”In a joint statement, the foreign ministers “welcomed” a new Palestinian government and “expressed the hope that its political platform will reflect the quartet principles and allow for early engagement.” They also “expressed deep concern at the humanitarian situation in the Palestinian territories,” again called on Israel to hand over to the Palestinians nearly $400 million in taxes and duties collected since February and urged Israel to reopen all crossings to and from Gaza.Mr. Abbas is hoping that a new government will be accompanied by a series of developments: the release of a captured Israeli soldier, the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza, the release of Hamas legislators and ministers held by Israel, a renewed cease-fire, a meeting between himself and the Israeli prime minister, Ehud Olmert, the release of about 600 Palestinian prisoners, the handover of the withheld taxes and duties, and the resumption of American and European aid.That complicated chain of events would get Israeli-Palestinian relations closer to where they were at the end of last year, but would not move the two sides much closer to a final peace agreement.Also on Friday, Israeli forces bombed a house in Rafah that the army said contained the entrance to a tunnel used to smuggle arms. The Israelis said that they had warned inhabitants to leave, and that there were secondary explosions suggesting that arms were in the tunnel.'"
"'06-09-16,'0','He said Friday that it was “unfortunate that the government of Singapore seemed not to be honoring” the agreement made to hold the meetings here. He also said that Singapore leaders told him they would review the cases of those denied entry.As it turned out, the government relented at the last minute, allowing 22 of the 27 advocates who had been denied visas to enter the country.Mostly, Mr. Wolfowitz and others sounded a note of optimism about the world economy by saluting the records of Singapore and other Asian countries in recent decades.“Being here is symbolically important,” Mr. Wolfowitz said Friday. “The success that we see around us in Singapore and more broadly in East Asia is a reminder that there is a path out of poverty, there is a path from poverty to prosperity.”But the success of prospering countries in East Asia, many of them reeling from financial crises only a decade ago, has also created tensions, with many of them demanding more of a voice in the institutions created after World War II to help avoid a repeat of the economic disasters of the 1930’s.Mr. Wolfowitz has also stirred a furor inside the World Bank with proposals to crack down on corruption in bank lending. Many leaders of donor countries in Europe have joined with some developing countries to resist the policy paper that Mr. Wolfowitz wants approved at meetings here.The critics charge that Mr. Wolfowitz’s anticorruption plan could lead to cutbacks in lending to the poorest countries.But the main issue of contention is a proposal backed by the Bush administration to change the governance of the International Monetary Fund to give more votes to China and three other developing countries, and to give dozens of other countries more votes in a restructuring over the next two years.Both American and I.M.F. officials say that while they were optimistic that it will be approved by 85 percent of the fund’s board by Monday, the votes were not there yet. Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. was due to arrive in Singapore Friday evening for a final round of lobbying with countries resisting the plan.Several countries are skeptical of the proposal, among them Brazil, India, Argentina, Indonesia and Malaysia, who all fear that they could be left out as the fund is reconfigured. Many poor countries also fear that their influence will be reduced in the rush to reward countries that have prospered in recent years.Some European countries are also resisting the proposal, concerned that they will be marginalized.Rodrigo de Rato, the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, said he realized that “most industrialized countries in the world” will have to “restrain” themselves as other, newer economic powers like China are given more of a voice and as poor countries in Africa and elsewhere get additional voting rights themselves.“There is a consensus that we need a new formula,” Mr. de Rato told reporters Friday, but he suggested that it had not been translated into a precise long-term plan.China, South Korea, Japan and other East Asian nations are sitting on huge dollar-denominated reserves flowing from their surpluses in trade with the United States. The American fear is that they will try to set up their own Asia-only fund to help bail out countries in the future.The American fear of a fracturing of the International Monetary Fund is an echo of the administration’s concern over the failure of the recent round of global trade talks, which collapsed over the summer in recriminations involving the United States, Europe and several developing countries.All of these countries blamed one another for not lowering tariff barriers enough to jolt the talks toward success, and administration officials say plainly they cannot afford to have another debacle involving another global economic institution.'"
"'06-09-16,'0','The widening federal inquiry comes after Dell’s shares have lost about a third of their value in the last year, amid shrinking revenue, falling profit and quality-control problems that recently led to the recall of millions of laptop and notebook computers because their defective batteries could overheat and burst into flame.The company’s founder and chairman, Michael S. Dell, said the company would add senior managers to help his often-criticized chief executive, Kevin B. Rollins.A C.E.O. FALLS Bristol-Myers Squibb fired its chief executive, Peter R. Dolan, amid a federal investigation of his efforts to suppress the generic version of one of the company’s best-selling drugs.Bristol-Myers’s board acted on the recommendation of an independent monitor who had been overseeing the company as part of the settlement of an earlier scandal involving accounting matters.While it mounts a search for a permanent successor to Mr. Dolan, the company said James M. Cornelius, a Bristol-Myers director, would serve as interim chief. Mr. Cornelius was recently interim chief executive of Guidant, the medical device maker, and was crucial to its acquisition by Boston Scientific.The latest controversy involved the blood-thinning drug Plavix, Bristol-Myers’s top-selling drug, with sales in the United States of $3.5 billion last year.A challenge to the Plavix patent by Apotex, a Canadian maker of generic drugs, is scheduled to be heard in federal court in January.DRUG TAX CASE Another pharmaceutical giant, GlaxoSmithKline, agreed to pay $3.4 billion to settle the largest tax dispute in the history of the Internal Revenue Service.Under the settlement, which resolves a dispute over whether and how the federal government should tax transactions between Glaxo’s holding company in the United States and its foreign divisions, Glaxo also agreed not to pursue a $1.8 billion income tax refund, the I.R.S. said.Federal officials will next help to press a whistle-blower lawsuit that accuses Dey Inc., a California affiliate of the German drug maker Merck KGaA, of defrauding the Medicare program.FORD BUYOUTS The Ford Motor Company accelerated and expanded its efforts to pare its costs and return to profitability. It agreed with the United Automobile Workers union to offer cash and other incentives to persuade 75,000 American workers to quit the company.The company also announced further white-collar job cuts, as well as spending reductions and changes in its lineup of car and truck models and brands.In January, Ford unveiled its Way Forward turnaround plan, which called for 30,000 job cuts and 14 plant closings by 2012. As the company’s position deteriorated — sales of its best-selling light trucks have been hurt by high gasoline prices, and Ford has lost $1.5 billion so far this year — it decided to accelerate those cuts and closings.Alan R. Mulally, a Boeing executive, will take over as Ford’s new chief executive on Oct. 1, succeeding William Clay Ford Jr., great-grandson of the company’s founder, Henry Ford.SOME RELIEF Even though crude oil prices have fallen by more than $10 a barrel over the last month, OPEC ministers agreed not to reduce production, a move they might have taken to try to keep prices from falling further or faster.While energy prices remain high, they have been falling from the summer peak because of a light hurricane season so far, the cease-fire between Israel and Hezbollah, and the United Nations’ decision not to impose sanctions on Iran.Even at the recent peak, crude did not rise to $100 a barrel, as some traders had predicted. Still, they said oil markets remained volatile and prices could soar again if hurricanes rake the Gulf Coast, the United Nations imposes sanctions on Iran, or political violence resumes in Nigeria, a major producer.While the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries kept production steady this week, analysts said the OPEC ministers are starting to think about whether to cut output next year.TRADE RUMBLES In one of his first major policy speeches since becoming Treasury secretary this summer, Henry M. Paulson Jr. told Chinese leaders that their nation’s future was imperiled by economic policies that Americans and others see as unfair.In unusually forceful language, he said China had kept the value of its currency artificially low relative to the dollar, giving it an unfair advantage in global trade by making other nations’ goods cost more than they should in China while giving its own exports a price advantage in foreign markets.He also repeated demands that China loosen its controls on foreign investment and on the activities of its own banks.The United States, the European Union and Canada may soon file a complaint with the World Trade Organization against China’s tariffs on auto part imports, The Wall Street Journal reported.'"
"'06-09-16,'0','At both tables, South was in four hearts, having used a two-club artificial inquiry over partner’s one-no-trump rebid to uncover the three-card heart support.Declarer must lose two clubs and one spade, and so has to pick up the heart suit without loss.When Alain Levy was West for France, he led the club ace, and his partner, Hervé Mouiel, played the nine, showing an even number of clubs. Levy continued with the club king and a third club, declarer ruffing.When McGann led the club ace, Hanlon also dropped the nine, but they were using upside-down attitude signals in this position, so it was discouraging. This persuaded McGann to shift to the spade five at Trick 2, South ducking the first spade and winning the second.Both Souths, Paul Chemla for France and Tommy Garvey for Ireland, entered dummy with a diamond and called for the heart five, taking East’s king with the ace. Now when a low heart was led back toward the board, we can see that it was “easy” to finesse dummy’s nine. And that is exactly what Garvey did to make his contract. But Chemla was confident that if East had started with the doubleton king-ten of hearts, he would have falsecarded with the king on the first round. So Chemla called for the heart queen on the second round of the suit and went down two, losing two spades, one heart and two clubs.Plus 620 and plus 200 gave Ireland 13 international match points.What are the a priori chances of East’s having the singleton king or doubleton king-ten? For a singleton king, they are 2.8 percent; for a doubleton king-ten, 3.4 percent. So, assuming East will always falsecard, Chemla made the right play. But will East always falsecard? Probably not. For example (although this cannot apply here), he would have to be confident partner could not have a singleton or doubleton jack.When Garvey, Hanlon, McGann and their teammates John Carroll, Nick FitzGibbon and Adam Mesbur flew back to Dublin, there were 80 fans at the airport to greet them. Oh, that every country’s bridge enthusiasts were so supportive.'"
"'06-09-16,'0','CECILE LINDSTEDT cares so much about how the downtown looks in this village along the Hudson that for years she has led a volunteer effort to plant shrubs and flowers along Main Street. But when dogs, which were being curbed by their owners, started to kill the plants, she decided last month to post more than 25 laminated signs along the street, telling residents where the pets could and could not go.The signs are rather direct. One says, “Dogs Pee Here,” with a picture of a dog raising a leg; another shows a squatting dog with a red slash through the picture.But they might have been too direct for some residents. Most of the signs have disappeared, and while the mayor said he had no problems with them, he did receive a few complaints from residents. “I don’t see anything wrong with it,” Mayor Anthony Phillips said, adding that Mrs. Lindstedt’s gardening has made downtown look great.Mrs. Lindstedt began her career as a “guerrilla gardener” six years ago, weeding and tending downtown trees, and enlisting friends to help.Dianne Falzarine, the owner of Déjà Vu, a clothing store on Main Street, said she did not even notice the signs until an “annoyed” customer who had just bought a $1,000 gown complained about the leg-lifting dog graphic on the pole outside the store.'"
"'06-09-16,'0','VERENA and Rolf Baumgartner have been married for 34 years and have run Brasserie Swiss for nearly 29. One imagines that entering the Ossining restaurant is like visiting their home, with its upright piano against one wall, pictures of Switzerland everywhere and soft yodeling playing in the background.It is a comfortable, friendly place and — this is the key to its appeal — emphatically untrendy. There is no chocolate lava cake or the latest take on pan-seared sea bass. Instead, you’ll find authentic, delicious interpretations of traditional Swiss favorites. The menu and décor may not have changed in decades, but both are presented with care and love.Mr. Baumgartner, the chef, thinks about each dish as a whole. So the Wiener schnitzel comes with a slice of lemon, a curl of anchovy creating a bowl around its edge to hold in a spoonful of capers. The tender piece of veal (not pork, as you’ll find at many restaurants) is perfectly fried and lovely on its own, but combine it with the rest and the tastes hit a whole new level.Wiener schnitzel, lamb chops and bratwurst (excellent, from a Colorado butcher) are accompanied by crisp rösti — a kind of hash browns — made only with Idaho potatoes. Geschnetzeltes (strips of veal in a cream sauce) and jagerschnitzel (pork chops in brown sauce) come with spaetzle, which are tiny, light pastalike dumplings that help cushion the food and amplify its flavors.These days, most entrees are accompanied by an array of late summer vegetables. Yellow squash, zucchini, carrots, cauliflower, broccoli and green peppers are sautéed together. But it’s the red cabbage side that nearly steals the show. Mr. Baumgartner marinates the cabbage in balsamic vinegar and red wine with apples and seasonings, then mixes it with garlic and onions sautéed in duck fat. The result is a sweet, savory, rich pleasure that could stand as a dish on its own.'"
"'06-09-16,'0','Mr. Youk Chhang, who is now 45, heads the Documentation Center of Cambodia, a private organization that over the past decade has collected a trove of 600,000 pages of documents, 6,000 photographs and 200 documentary films recording the Khmer Rouge rule.With financing mostly from the United States government and from Sweden, he and a staff that has now grown to 50 people have mapped about 20,000 mass grave sites, 189 prisons and 80 memorials, and have transcribed 4,000 interviews with former members of the Khmer Rouge.SINCE his meeting with Mr. Sous Thy in a village not far from Phnom Penh, Mr. Youk Chhang has studied the stories of more former Khmer Rouge cadres than perhaps anybody else.And he has concluded that people like Mr. Sous Thy and people like himself could quite easily have changed places.“They are us, and we are them,” he said in an interview in his small office in Phnom Penh where photographs of victims and killers hang on the walls. “They are the evil side of us. Crimes are committed by human beings, by people just like me.”In July, after years of delay, a special prosecutor’s office opened a formal investigation into the Khmer Rouge crimes, the first step in a process financed by the United Nations to bring top leaders to trial.Mr. Youk Chhang has handed over hundreds of thousands of documents and other materials that will form the core of the evidence to be presented in court, probably next year.He has little sympathy for the self-satisfied, self-justifying leaders of the Khmer Rouge regime, now living freely in Cambodia, who are the targets of the investigation. Fewer than a dozen are likely to face trial.But after so many encounters with lower-ranking Khmer Rouge, he has found a sense of kinship with people whose actions he abhors.“I want to imagine what I would have done,” he said. “What would I have said to myself 28 years ago? There were all those people my age, just little kids, naïve, innocent.”Mr. Youk Chhang was 14 when the Khmer Rouge seized power, forcing him into hard labor in the fields. Food and death became his twin obsessions. His father, an architect, died before the Khmer Rouge time. His mother survived and lives today in Phnom Penh.Decades later, the sound of the early-morning bell from his work brigade still disturbs his thoughts.“You can hear it deep inside your soul, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang,” he said. “It’s like the sound of death. It’s 3 in the morning and you’ve got to go to work, and you know you will see people dying that day in the fields around you.”His experiences have left him with a horror of physical brutality of even the most minor sort.“When I see people hit their children, I cannot take this,” he said. Once, he said, he canceled an official meeting at a school when he saw a teacher strike a student. “I couldn’t talk to him. I had to leave. I feel it’s unacceptable to do harm to humans.”AS soon as he could, at the end of the Khmer Rouge years, Mr. Youk Chhang joined a flood of hundreds of thousands of refugees and found a new home in Dallas, where he married and earned a college degree. His two children, now 14 and 15, still live there, and he said they understood only a little about the Khmer Rouge years.But although he had found health, safety and a new life, he said, he remained broken inside, like almost all survivors of those traumatic years, whatever role they had played.“The physical pain is gone,” he said. “But your heart, it is so hard to put back together. It is like a stained-glass window in a church, all the colors smashed on the floor. I thought, How do they put it back together?”Searching for answers, he began assisting Ben Kiernan, a Cambodia expert at Yale University, who in 1995 sent him back to Cambodia to open the documentation center.One of the strangest things Mr. Youk Chhang has discovered as he has interviewed survivors and explored his own feelings is nostalgia. Even in the most terrible conditions, a moment of life is precious and fleeting, and when it is gone we may long for it.When Mr. Youk Chhang showed Mr. Sous Thy a photograph of himself from his Khmer Rouge personnel file, the former cadre’s face softened with memories. “That was my youth,” he said, gazing at the picture.Mr. Youk Chhang’s memories are very different, but embedded in the horrors are moments of intense feeling, even happiness, that draw him back.“In the darkness,” he said, “any color, people treasure it, treasure the color of the sugar cane we grow. You treasure the beauty because it was so dark. You treasure the color of the straw that you use to make a roof. You treasure the smell of mint that you grew.”Nothing in his safe life today is as vivid as those moments stolen from fear. None of his feelings are as sharp as the gratitude he felt for his mother, who gave him her food when he was ill and hoarded grains of rice for him when he was away. “I am doing all of this for my mother, honestly,” he said.“She loved to cook for us, and she loved the crab that we caught in the rice fields,” he said, remembering the Khmer Rouge years. “We would fish for the crabs with a bamboo basket, and whenever we got a crab we would laugh; we were so happy.“I wish I could go back, to be in that moment again,” he said. “I wish I could go back and tell her that I love her.”'"

"'06-09-17,'0','Illegitimate sons-in-law of mixed race do not merge naturally into the social fabric of wealthy Surrey, and Penelope's parents were no exception to this time-honoured truism. In a favourable light, I used to tell myself when I was growing up, I look more suntanned Irish than mid-brown Afro, plus my hair is straight not crinkly, which goes a long way if you're assimilating. But that never fooled Penelope's mother or her fellow wives at the golf club, her worst nightmare being that her daughter would produce an all-black grandchild on her watch, which may have accounted for Penelope's reluctance to put matters to the test, although in retrospect I am not totally convinced of this, part of her motive in marrying me being to shock her mother and upstage her younger sister.A word here regarding my dear late father's life struggle will not be deemed out of place. His entry into the world, he confided to me, had been no smoother than my own. Born in 1917 to a corporal in the Royal Ulster Fusiliers and a fourteen-year-old Normandy peasant girl who happened to be passing at the time, he spent his childhood on the shunt between a hovel in the Sperrin Mountains and another in northern France, until by dint of study plus his inherited bilinguality he clawed himself a place in a Junior Seminary in the wilds of County Donegal and thus set his young feet unthinkingly on the path to God.Sent to France for the greater refinement of his faith, he endured without complaint interminable years of gruelling instruction in Catholic theology, but as soon as the Second World War broke out he grabbed the nearest bicycle, which with Irish wit he assured me was the property of a godless Protestant, and pedalled hell for leather across the Pyrenees to Lisbon. Stowing away on a tramper bound for Leopoldville as was, he evaded the attentions of a colonial government ill disposed towards stray white missionaries, and attached himself to a remote community of friars dedicated to bringing the One True Faith to the two hundred-odd tribes of the Eastern Congo, an ambitious commitment at any time. Those who now and then have accused me of impulsiveness need look no further than my dear late father on his heretic's pushbike.Aided by native converts whose tongues the natural linguist swiftly made his own, he baked bricks and limed them with red mud trodden by his own feet, dug ditches in the hillside and installed latrines amid the banana groves. Next came the building: first the church, then the school with its twin bell tower, then the Mother Mary Clinic, then the fish-ponds and fruit and vegetable plantations to supply them, such being his true vocation as a peasant in a region lavishly endowed with Nature's riches whether you are talking cassava, papaya, maize, soya beans, quinine, or Kivu's wild strawberries which are the best in the world bar none. After all this came the Mission house itself, and behind the Mission house a low brick hostel with small windows high up for Mission servants.In God's name he trekked hundreds of kilometres to remote patelins and mining settlements, never failing when opportunity arose to add another language to his ever-growing collection until a day when he returned to his Mission to find his fellow priests fled, the cows, goats and chickens stolen, the school and Mission house razed, the hospital pillaged, its nurses hamstrung, raped and slaughtered, and himself a prisoner of the last rag-tag elements of the fearsome Simba, a murderous rabble of misguided revolutionists whose sole aim, until their official extinction a few years previously, had been to visit death and mayhem on all perceived agents of colonisation, which could be anyone nominated by themselves, or by the guiding spirits of their long-deceased warrior ancestors.As a general principle, it is true, the Simba stopped short of harming white priests, fearing that by doing so they would break the dawa that rendered themselves immune to flying bullets. In the case of my dear late father, however, his captors were quick to set aside their reservations, arguing that since he spoke their language as well as they did, he was plainly a black devil in disguise. Of his fortitude in captivity many inspiring anecdotes were later told. Whipped repeatedly in order to expose the true colour of his devil's skin, tortured and forced to witness the torturing of others, he proclaimed the Gospel and begged God's forgiveness for his tormentors. Whenever able, he went among his fellow prisoners, administering the Sacrament. Yet not the Holy Church in all its wisdom could have been prepared for the cumulative effect on him of these privations. Mortification of the flesh, we are taught, furthers the triumph of the spirit. Such however was not the case for my dear late father, who within months of his release had demonstrated the flaw in this convenient theory, and not merely with my dear late mother:If there is divine purpose to your conception, son, he confided to me on his deathbed, resorting to his lovely Irish brogue lest his fellow priests should overhear him through the floorboards, it is to be found in that stinking prison hut and at the whipping post. The thought that I might die without knowing the consolation of a woman's body was the one torture I could not bear.Her reward for producing me was as cruel as it was unjust. At my father's urging she set off for her home village with the intention of giving birth to me among her clan and tribe. But these were turbulent times for the Congo or, as General Mobutu insisted it be known, Zaire. In the name of Authenticity, foreign priests had been expelled for the crime of baptising babies with Western names, schools had been forbidden to teach the life of Jesus, and Christmas declared a normal working day. It was therefore not surprising that the elders of my mother's village baulked at the prospect of nurturing a white missionary's love-child whose presence among them could invite instant retribution, and accordingly sent the problem back to where it came from.But the Mission Fathers were as reluctant as the village elders to receive us, referring my mother instead to a distant convent where she arrived with only hours to spare before my birth. Three months of tough love at the hands of the Carmelites were more than enough for her. Reasoning that they were better placed than she to provide me with a future, she consigned me to their mercy and, escaping at dead of night by way of the bath-house roof, crept back to her kin and family, who weeks afterwards were massacred in their entirety by an aberrant tribe, right down to my last grandparent, uncle, cousin, distant aunt and half- brother or sister.A village headman's daughter, son, my father whispered through his tears, when I pressed him for details that might assist me in forming a mental picture of her to sustain me in my later years. I had taken shelter under his roof. She cooked our food and brought me the water to wash with. It was the generosity of her that overwhelmed me. He had eschewed the pulpit by then, and had no appetite for verbal pyrotechnics. Nevertheless the memory rekindled the Irishman's smouldering rhetorical fires: As tall as you'll be one day, son! As beautiful as all creation! How in God's name can they tell me you were born in sin? You were born in love, my son! There is no sin but hate!The retribution meted out to my father by the Holy Church was less draconian than my mother's, but severe. One year in a Jesuit rehab penitentiary outside Madrid, two more as a worker-priest in a Marseilles slum, and only then back to the Congo he so unwisely loved. And how he swung it I don't know, and probably God doesn't either, but somewhere along his stony path he persuaded the Catholic orphanage that had custody of me to give me up to him. Thereafter the half-caste bastard who was Salvo trailed after him in the care of servants chosen for their age and ugliness, first in the guise of offspring of a deceased uncle, later as acolyte and server, until that fateful night of my tenth birthday when, conscious as much of his mortality as my ripening, he poured out his very human heart to me as described above, which I regarded, and still do, as the greatest compliment a father can pay to his accidental son.The years following my dear late father's death did not pass smoothly for the orphaned Salvo, owing to the fact that the white missionaries viewed my continued presence among them as a festering affront, hence my Swahili nickname of mtoto wa siri or secret child. Africans maintain that we derive our spirit from our father and our blood from our mother, and that was my problem in a nutshell. Had my dear late father been black, I might have been tolerated as excess baggage. But he was white through and through, whatever the Simba might have thought, and Irish with it, and white missionaries, it is well known, do not engender babies on the side. The secret child might serve at priests' table and the altar, and attend their schools but, come the approach of an ecclesiastical dignitary of whatever colour, he was whisked to the Mission workers' hostel to be hidden until the threat blew over, which is neither to disparage the Brethren for their high-mindedness, nor to blame them for the occasionally excessive warmth of their regard. Unlike my dear late father, they had restricted themselves to their own gender when addressing their carnality: as witness PËre AndrÈ our great Mission orator who lavished more attention on me than I could comfortably accommodate, or PËre FranÁois, who liked to think of AndrÈ as his chosen friend and took umbrage at this flowering of affection. In our Mission school, meanwhile, I enjoyed neither the deference shown to our smattering of white children nor the comradeship owed me by my native peers. Little wonder then if I gravitated naturally towards the Mission servants' low brick hostel which, unbeknown to the Fathers, was the true hub of our community, the natural sanctuary for any passing traveller, and the trading point of oral information for miles around.And it was there, curled up unnoticed on a wood pallet beside the brick chimney-breast, that I listened spellbound to the tales of itinerant huntsmen, witch doctors, spell-sellers, warriors and elders, scarcely venturing a word of my own for fear of being packed off to bed. It was there also that my ever- growing love of the Eastern Congo's many languages and dialects took root. Hoarding them as my dear late father's precious legacy, I covertly polished and refined them, storing them in my head as protection from I knew not what perils, pestering native and missionary alike for a nugget of vernacular or turn of phrase. In the privacy of my tiny cell I composed my own childish dictionaries by candlelight. Soon, these magic puzzle-pieces became my identity and refuge, the private sphere that nobody could take away from me and only the few enter.And I have often wondered, as I wonder now, what course the secret child's life might have taken, had I been permitted to continue along this solitary and ambivalent path: and whether the pull of my mother's blood might have turned out to be stronger than my father's spirit. The question remains academic, however, since my dear late father's former brethren were energetically conspiring to be rid of me. My accusing skin colour, my versatility in languages, my cocky Irish manner and worst of all the good looks that, according to the Mission servants, I owed to my mother, were a daily reminder of his erring ways. . . .'"
"'06-09-17,'0','This thing with Blue and the dogs and Elgin Bern happened a while back, a few years after some of our boys-like Elgin Bern and Cal Sears-came back from Vietnam, and a lot of others-like Eddie Vorey and Carl Joe Carol, the Stewart cousins-didn't. We don't know how it worked in other towns, but that war put something secret in our boys who returned. Something quiet and untouchable. You sensed they knew things they'd never say, did things on the sly you'd never discover. Great cardplayers, those boys, able to bluff with the best, let no joy show in their face no matter what they were holding.A small town is a hard place to keep a secret, and a small southern town with all that heat and all those open windows is an even harder place than most. But those boys who came back from overseas, they seemed to have mastered the trick of privacy. And the way it's always been in this town, you get a sizeable crop of young, hard men coming up at the same time, they sort of set the tone.So, not long after the war, we were a quieter town, a less trusting one (or so some seemed to think), and that's right when tobacco money and textile money reached a sort of critical mass and created construction money and pretty soon there was talk that our small town should maybe get a little bigger, maybe build something that would bring in more tourist dollars than we'd been getting from fireworks and pecans.That's when some folks came up with this Eden Falls idea-a big carnival-type park with roller coasters and water slides and such. Why should all those Yankees spend all their money in Florida? South Carolina had sun too. Had golf courses and grapefruit and no end of KOA campgrounds.So now a little town called Eden was going to have Eden Falls. We were going to be on the map, people said. We were going to be in all the brochures. We were small now, people said, but just you wait. Just you wait.And that's how things stood back then, the year Perkin and Jewel Lut's marriage hit a few bumps and Elgin Bern took up with Shelley Briggs and no one seemed able to hold onto their dogs. . . .'"
"'06-09-17,'0','Tambor A.: Well, we do perform in front of a live audience — and it has the same feel — it's the same thrill and the same edge — quite fun and spontaneous when we perform live.How do you both feel that the TV sitcom has evolved, or has it? And how do you hope that your show will reflect this evolution? Do you believe that television, as a whole, is changing or evolving? And, if it is, what do you see television evolving into? — Bobbi Jo LathanSherman Oaks, CALithgow A.: Our show, in a way, is a return to form for the sitcom. In recent years, single camera comedies without a laugh track have been the new thing. But I sense that people have come to miss the energy that comes from the interaction between actors and a studio audience. Think for a moment about Jackie Gleason and Lucille Ball.Tambor A.: The whole thing is changing — the revolution is here what with the iPod and such. What I love about our show is that it has all the ingredients — character, story, sharp, sharp writing, a live platform, and a brilliant new frame into which we as actors can play fully — and that's what is needed especially now — humor, the ability to laugh and laugh hard at our foibles. Let's face it — people are ridiculous.Q: Can comedy be taught? Can a person learn how to be funny? — Jonas Lerman, Eugene, ORLithgow A: Audiences teach people how to be funny, but some people are funny in their bones. The best example I can give you is Jeffrey Tambor.Tambor A: I never know how to answer this question. I have had great mentors in my life. My mother had one of the wittiest minds around, so I guess I copied her, and then later on, we have Garry Shandling who changed my whole vision of what comedy is. So there it is, my mom and Garry. What a team.On previous TV shows, you've seemed like two of the most spontaneous actors around. How much improvisational freedom do you think generally makes for good entertainment, and what happens when two fairly hammy actors show up on the same set? — Bill Greffin, Oak Park, IllinoisLithgow A.: Our shows are far from improvised. We have a brilliant writing staff that is especially good at writing in our two voices. It's true that we are both fairly hammy comic actors, so we basically take turns being the straight man.Tambor A.: I trust John with my comic life. He is a special actor, and I feel as if I have known him forever. And audiences love him and trust him, too. That always comes through — he just loves acting, and life, and that special blend is magic.Many entertainers who deal in laughs make orders of magnitude more money than the average American. I have detected a certain derisive condecension towards their audience in, for example: Seinfeld, Larry David and semi-subtlely in Letterman, there's even a tad in Leno. The paradigm for disrespecting the audience was certainly Richard Pryor at the Hollywood Bowl. My question at last, they say do you think big money breeds contempt in comic actors and standups? Can success turn a clown in to an ass? — Arnie Tracey, Ottawa OntarioLithgow A.: That is a provocative question. I don't know the answer, but as a theater actor I have learned to always respect my audience. Comedians are complex people and a lot of comedy is born from insecurity, frustration and even anger. I tend to think of myself more as an actor than a comedian and I hope that's not true of me. But, who knows?Tambor A.: Well, I think Larry David's character is anti-social (not Larry David himself, who is one of the nicest guys around.) And the other guys--well, I don't agree with your assessment, I just don't see it. They just couldn't have done so by being, as you say, derisive. On the other hand you can't have your hat in your hand when approaching comedy. ""Please"" doesn't work. We admire the bullfighter for his bravery, and we admire the comedian for pretty much the same thing.I have admired each of your careers for the longest time, whether it's been the gut wrenching dramas or the hysterical comedy shows you've both been in. How did you both hook up to do this show? — Jane Stein, Portland, ORLithgow A.: Thank you for the compliment. For both Jeffrey and me, comedy and drama are all a part of the same process. How did we hook up? We were made for each other. It was fate.Tambor A.: They sent me a script on the Friday that ""Arrested Development"" finally went down. I called my agent on Saturday, and I said yes. It makes me one of the more fortunate actors around, to say the least. One wonderful door closed and then this other tremendous door opened. Believe me when I say this, it doesn't usually happen like this.Both of you have had stellar careers on both the stage and the screen. How would you compare the requisite acting skills for each? What makes a good stage actor, vs. what makes a good screen actor? — Michael Temlin, New York, NYLithgow A.: A good stage actor simply has much more experience in front of an audience. This is invaluable for a four camera sitcom with a studio audience. No editor can save you.You've both TV comedy veterans I remember enjoying Mr. Tambor on the Three's Company spin-off The Roepers as a kid. Has taping a sitcom changed over the years, and if so, how? — Ian Prikryl, Austin, TXLithgow A.: My only other experience was 3rd Rock. This show has the same producer, director, assistant director, sound stage and even dressing room. So no, things aren't all that different.Tambor A.: No, it's pretty much the same. It's certainly the same set of nerves, and the strange and arcane ritual of taking a bow before beginning the show, but certainly something I have not gotten used to.How did you manage to break into fame so effortlessly? And a follow up, how does it feel to be considered sex symbols on certain college campuses in the Central Massachusetts area? Matt, Framingham, MALithgow A.: I'm glad it looks effortless. It wasn't so easy in the early 70's when I was driving a taxi in New York. Central Massachusetts? My God! That's where my mother lives!'"
"'06-09-17,'0','He said banks around the world also needed to stop doing business with North Korea, but added that North Korea was already almost entirely isolated from the world’s financial system. By contrast, Iran is still a major player globally.The Treasury chief’s comments came after he met with his counterparts from Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Canada, Japan and the European Union, who had come for the annual gathering of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.The comments appeared to reflect the emerging Bush administration strategy on Iran as efforts to impose sanctions by the United Nations Security Council have faltered.The administration charges that Iran has a secret nuclear weapons program, a charge that Iran denies. Iran is also accused of transferring funds to Hezbollah and other Islamic militant organizations through regular commercial banks.Last week, in what administration officials call a major escalation in the effort to squeeze Iran economically, the Treasury Department announced that Bank Saderat, a major bank in Iran, would no longer have even indirect access to the United States financial system.Banking experts say that the decree means that Iran will have difficulty selling anything for dollars through Bank Saderat, because any commercial exchange that uses dollars normally obtains them from an American bank. Oil in particularly is always traded in dollars. Many banking experts say the administration may make other banks off-limits soon.After the announcement on Bank Saderat, two senior Treasury officials visited Europe to try to persuade regulators and banks to stop doing business with Bank Saderat and any other banks that are alleged to be involved in illicit activities. Some European banks have already curtailed their activities with Iran, but many leading banks have refused.Stuart Levey, under secretary of the Treasury for terrorism and financial intelligence, visited Britain, France, Switzerland, Italy and Germany, and the deputy Treasury secretary, Robert Kimmitt, went to Germany. France, Italy and Germany have extensive commercial relations with Iran and its trading companies.The Treasury Department has declined to say whom they met with.Iran was only one of many subjects in Mr. Paulson’s meetings with the finance ministers. Also on the agenda was a discussion of the world economy, which Mr. Paulson said had grown in recent years at rates that he and others had not seen in a generation. Despite that, he acknowledged risks arising from the failure of recent global trade talks, high energy prices and the problem of what are called “economic imbalances.”That phrase is a euphemism for a broad set of problems, including the fact that the United States imports much more than it exports and has thus become the world’s leading debtor, owing hundreds of billions of dollars to China, Japan and other trading partners. The United States says this problem can be remedied by the trading partners importing more from the United States and also by China allowing its currency to rise in value in relation to the dollar.In a statement Saturday, the finance ministers of the leading industrial countries said, “Greater exchange rate flexibility is desirable in emerging economies with large current-account surpluses, especially China.”As the finance ministers hold their meetings, representatives of more than 500 nongovernmental groups — many of them dissenting from the policies of the bank, the fund and rich countries — are holding meetings on the sidelines.But Singapore’s initial refusal to allow many of the representatives into the country gave them too little time to get here, even after Singapore relented under political pressure. As a result, several of the most outspoken critics of globalization are not at the meetings.'"
"'06-09-17,'0','Just days after Mr. Newsom established the reward, Mr. Herrera announced a $20,000 civil judgment against Carlos Romero, 20, who had been “tagging” with abandon in the western part of the city using a variety of aliases, including “Lafer,” “Coma,” “Queso” and “Cream.”As part of the judgment, Mr. Romero was ordered to stay away from spray paint and indelible markers and received a curfew of 11 p.m.. He was also instructed to record a public service announcement for radio.“This is a message that if you’re going out to tag, if we catch you, there’s going to be a stiff price to pay,” Mr. Herrera said.But while Mr. Romero prepares to head to the studio, “BNE” remains at large, a fact that no doubt wears on Officer Christopher Putz, who oversees the San Francisco Police Department’s two-person graffiti abatement unit. Officer Putz, who has been on the graffiti beat since 2001, takes his work seriously; he will not allow his face to be photographed and he gives his age merely as “in my 30’s,” for fear of tipping his hand. “It’s a chess game,” he said.The battle between graffiti supporters (who call it art) and detractors (who call it vandalism) dates back decades and spans the globe. The authorities in New York — where artists like Keith Haring and Jean-Michel Basquiat worked the same streets as those painting walls with sobriquets like Taki, Revs/Cost and MQ — have long struggled with graffiti, and continue to. A 2005 antigraffiti law is being held up in court while a federal judge considers a ban on the sale of paint and indelible markers to anyone under 21.Officer Putz says San Francisco has also always had a place in the graffiti underworld, in part because landmarks like the Golden Gate Bridge tempt graffiti glory-seekers. “Who wants to tag some Podunk town no one has ever heard of?” he said.Experts say the city’s enforcement efforts and economic success have dimmed graffiti’s appeal in recent years.“In the mid-1990’s, San Francisco was one of the best cities in the world,” said Shepard Fairey, who became known in the 1990’s for his “Obey, Giant” stickers, which depicted the face of the wrestler Andre the Giant. “They weren’t cleaning things very quickly, so things would stay up a long time. A lot of writers from New York and L.A. were doing things there. But then the dot-com thing came, and the rich people came, and it got really clean.”But “BNE” and the reward have drawn attention back to San Francisco, said Hugo Martinez, an art dealer in New York who represents a stable of veteran and up-and-coming graffiti practitioners.“Whenever the mayor starts to get involved in a swingfest, the masses are going to come out,” Mr. Martinez said. “And he couldn’t do anything better for the graffiti writer’s career than to do this.”Officer Putz will not say whether he knows who “BNE” is or what the initials stand for, but the mystery is a source of avid speculation on the Internet, where some have speculated that it means “Be Nowhere Else,” “Breaking ’N’ Entering” or even “Bureau of Narcotics Enforcement.”Variations on President Bush’s name are also popular: “Bush Not Elected,” for example. One blogger said “BNE” was the code for the airport in Brisbane, Australia, and posited that the stickers, along with the Japanese script, were a campaign announcing flights from there to Japan.Most, however, doubt that “BNE” is an advertisement, and instead think it might be the work of a graffiti artist who goes by the name of Benet and whose graffiti spelling out his name in large block letters have been seen in San Francisco. Officer Putz would not confirm whether Benet — whose real name is not known — was a suspect, but did say, “There’s only a handful of people who have any real skill.”In recent years, other California cities, including San Jose and Los Angeles, have increased efforts against graffiti, which some authorities say has ties to gang behavior and can be a gateway to more serious crime. “There is absolutely no doubt there’s a link between graffiti activity and more serious criminal activity,” Mr. Herrera said.Mr. Fairey says politicians have long used the cleanup of graffiti as a way to score quality-of-life points with voters. “It’s cosmetic and superficial,” he said. “It’s a perfect metaphor for politics in general.”But he agrees that enforcement efforts have gotten tougher. “I used to put posters up in L.A., and they’d stay up for six months,” said Mr. Fairey, 36, who runs a successful design firm in Los Angeles. “Now they stay up for three days.”Mr. Martinez says he believes he knows who “BNE” is and thinks he is currently in Tokyo planning his next move. The “BNE” stickers have also been seen in New York and Tokyo.“Word is,” Mr. Martinez wrote in an e-mail message, “this guy may be the first writer to go ‘all world’ vs. ‘all city.’ ”For his part, Officer Putz, who says he actually enjoys looking at the graffiti, says he just wants “BNE” and other graffitists to stay away from San Francisco.“We want the law-abiding tourists,” he said. “We don’t want the traveling vandals.”'"
"'06-09-17,'0','Charlie Frye watched a videotape of a sliding Trent Green getting hit last week, and he was not frightened at all.The vicious but legal hit by Cincinnati defensive end Robert Geathers put Green, Kansas City’s quarterback, in the hospital with a concussion, horrifying some around the N.F.L. and renewing a debate about protecting quarterbacks.Frye, the Browns’ quarterback, said, “That’s why I don’t slide.”But he might want to reconsider how he finishes his runs if he plans to scramble as much as he did in Cleveland’s season-opening 19-14 loss to New Orleans last week. When he had no open receivers or when his pocket was collapsing around him, Frye simply tucked the ball under his arm and took off, rushing for a team-high 44 yards on 6 runs. He also scored a touchdown.But Frye did not bail out before contact.“Unless a linebacker is coming at me at full speed, I’m not going to hit the dirt,” Frye said. “That’s kind of like a give-up play. I’m not saying Trent Green was giving up, but that’s my mentality.”On Wednesday, the N.F.L. absolved Geathers of wrongdoing, saying he had the right to hit Green, who started “a late slide.” In addition, Geathers was blocked in the back by a Kansas City player and was no longer in control of his body when he slammed his right shoulder into Green.'"
"'06-09-17,'0','The housing boom would never have lasted as long as it did if mortgage lenders had to worry about being paid back in full. But instead of relying on borrowers to repay, most lenders quickly sell the loans, generating cash to make more mortgages.For the past few years, the most voracious loan buyers have been private investment banks, followed by government-sponsored housing agencies, like Fannie Mae. The buyers carve up the loans into mortgage-backed securities — complex i.o.u.’s with various terms, yields and levels of risk. They then sell the securities to investors the world over, at breathtaking profit. The investors earn relatively high returns as homeowners repay their mortgages.The process has encouraged homeownership and created wealth. But there is a downside, too, which demands attention.As the boom thundered on, the pool of available credit grew larger than the pool of creditworthy borrowers, resulting in an explosion of risky mortgages with features like no money down, interest-only payments and super-low teaser rates. Investors — including mutual funds, pension funds, hedge funds, insurance companies and foreign central banks, to name a few — currently hold $2 trillion in mortgage-backed securities from investment banks, triple the amount from three years ago. Investors also own $4 trillion in mortgage-backed securities from government-sponsored agencies.In a market so vast and dynamic, everyone knows that if mortgage defaults should rise, damage could reverberate throughout the financial system. So far, defaults have inched up. But many homeowners are at a dangerous juncture. Interest rates on adjustable mortgages are rising as home values are weakening, precluding for many the chance to refinance. Economists calculate that $750 billion of outstanding mortgage debt is now at measurable risk of default — about 7 percent of the total.No one can predict the depth of the housing slowdown or its effect on the global economy. Even the Federal Reserve has taken, for now, a wait-and-see approach. Meanwhile, markets seems to take comfort in the belief that if housing hit the skids, the Fed would exert damage control by aggressively lowering interest rates. There is no guarantee, however, that interest-rate easing would have the same powerful effect it had in the past.'"
"'06-09-17,'0','Early admissions programs, which date back to the 1950’s and now admit half of the freshman class on some campuses, are essentially a bargain between colleges and applicants. The college gives early applicants a small advantage, admitting some who might have been rejected had they applied later. In exchange, the students generally promise to attend the college if they’re admitted.The colleges then save money on financial aid, because students accepted early have little leverage to negotiate a better package. Perhaps more important, admissions officers can populate a large portion of their freshman class without worrying that an applicant will end up being admitted to a more prestigious college and choose it instead.The most prestigious college in the world, of course, is Harvard, and the gap between it and every other university is often underestimated. Yes, U.S. News & World Report ranked Princeton No. 1 this year, and colleges that emphasize teaching may well offer a better education than Harvard. But it still exerts a pull on teenagers that is unmatched.A few years ago, a group of economists surveyed 3,200 top high school seniors at 500 schools across the country, asking them which colleges had admitted them and which one they would attend. With this information, the researchers could estimate how often students chose one college over another.Among those who were admitted to both Harvard and Duke — sometimes called the Harvard of the South — and who attended one of the two, about 3 percent picked Duke, according to the economists’ statistical model. Only 11 percent chose Brown, perhaps the trendiest Ivy League university in recent years, over Harvard. Princeton and Stanford win only about 25 percent of their battles with Harvard. Yale gives the stiffest competition, winning about 35 percent of the time, which in politics would be considered a crushing landslide.For any college contemplating the end of early admissions, the implications are plain enough. “There are a lot of people who apply to Yale early or to Princeton early,” said Andrew Metrick, one of the economists who did the study and a professor at the University of Pennsylvania, “who might choose to go to Harvard if they got in.”Dozens of other colleges would be even more vulnerable to losing their best applicants. Today, students often choose to apply early to a college where they think they have a good chance of being admitted, rather than to one that seems like a long shot. Understanding this, admissions officers are happy to admit so many students early. As Ellen Fisher, college adviser at the Bronx High School of Science, said, the officers often ask themselves, “Is this someone we might lose if we don’t take early?”There are caveats to Harvard’s dominance. Every year, about 20 percent of the students it accepts turn it down, evidently deciding that prestige is not everything. If early admissions were to go away, some high school seniors would still find themselves able to resist the lure of a Harvard acceptance letter.Already, M.I.T., Stanford and Yale allow a student who was accepted early to apply elsewhere, opening themselves up to competition from Harvard. These colleges, or others, may well decide that the larger good of a fairer admissions process is worth the cost. “There is no question about it: early admissions advantages the advantaged,” William R. Fitzsimmons, Harvard’s dean of admissions, said. “It’s truly tilted.”Officials at Brown, Dartmouth, Penn, Princeton and Yale, for their part, suggested last week that they had no immediate plans to make a change. They all have more to lose than Mr. Fitzsimmons does.'"
"'06-09-17,'0','VIOLENT deaths continuously punctuate the civic discourse in Russia. The list of victims and motives is grim and long: contract hits on rivals, bombs to settle business disputes, racist attacks on laborers from the Caucasus or Central Asia and students from Africa or South America, and the almost regular killings of police officers in Russian republics where ethnic and religious tensions are inflamed. These are all part of the unsettled life in a nation still recovering from Lenin’s failed experiment.But the murder last week of Andrei Kozlov, one of Russia’s top bank regulators, served as a reminder that even the upper strata of society here are not immune from the vicious rules of the Russian street. Mr. Kozlov, who had been spearheading banking reform, was ambushed Wednesday night as he left a soccer game. Two assassins shot him in the torso and the head, then threw their pistols to the ground as they ran away. No arrests have been made.Investigators and Mr. Kozlov’s colleagues say he was almost certainly killed because of his work. He had been closing disreputable banks and pressuring money launderers — risky endeavors by any estimate. As Russia’s middle class has grown and its larger cities have undergone surges of development, the image of a nation in the grip of businessmen flanked by thick-necked men with assault rifles has softened. But the violence continues, at a slower pace since President Vladimir V. Putin came to power in 2000, but alarming nonetheless.The crusading Russian-American journalist, Paul Klebnikov, was murdered by contract killers in 2004; Mr. Klebnikov, an editor at Forbes, specialized in describing the links of Russian money and power. Anatoly Chubais, the architect of privatization who is now head of Russia’s electricity monopoly, narrowly dodged a bomb-and-rifle ambush in 2005; he was saved by his armored car as his bodyguards opened fire to allow his escape.Although the victims are rarely of such high stature, new examples abound of business disputes or efforts at business protection leading to gunfire and bombings. The nation reacts with resigned familiarity. Few foreign business executives have bodyguards, but the possibility of violence is part of the business fabric, along with endemic corruption and an arbitrary state bureaucracy.While the squeamish may be steering clear, investors seem undeterred. The Russian economy is booming. There is money to be made. On the day Mr. Kozlov was pronounced dead, there was public hand-wringing, but the Russian stock market rose.'"

On top of that, core consumer prices rose in August by only 0.2 percent. Thomas M.

"'06-09-17,'0','Already, patients at risk for diabetes — for example, those who are overweight or have a strong family history of the disease — are advised to diet and exercise. But the new study suggests that such people would also benefit from preventive medicine, the same way that people with high cholesterol are prescribed drugs to reduce their risk of heart attack, the authors said.Dr. Gerstein, who spoke by telephone from Copenhagen, said he “would certainly consider using the treatment now” in some patients, even though the drug has not been approved for that use in Europe and the United States.While 5 percent of the world’s population is estimated to have diabetes, researchers say that an additional 8 percent is “prediabetic,” meaning that blood tests indicate those people do not process sugar normally and are at high risk for developing the disease.“For the last 20 years, we have been developing a growing number of drugs and interventions that could prevent heart disease,” Dr. Gerstein said. “Now we have entered the era of diabetes prevention. It is very, very important.”In a skeptical online editorial, also in The Lancet, Jaakko Tuomilehto of Helsinki University said “intensive lifestyle changes” seemed a safer and an equally effective approach. Even in the study, participants were advised to make such changes even as some were given the drug as well.Looking at the data in another way, Dr. Tuomilehto estimated that 544 people would have to be treated with medicine for three years to avoid one death from cardiovascular disease. He said drugs in the class were associated with heart failure in some cases and could be quite costly, because they potentially needed to be maintained for a lifetime.Intensive style of living changes “should remain the mainstay for the prevention of Type 2 diabetes,” he wrote.The study focused on people likely to develop Type 2 diabetes, whose rates are skyrocketing worldwide. In Type 2 diabetes, which generally develops in adulthood, patients have high levels of blood sugar because their cells become resistant to insulin, the hormone that regulates the uptake of sugar from the blood.In some ways, the results represented a ray of hope when governments and doctors are struggling to control the rising rate of diabetes worldwide. In the United States, about 20 million people — 7 percent of the population — have diabetes, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and an estimated 54 million have prediabetes, although most do not know it. In Europe, 8.4 percent of the adult population is diabetic, and 60 million adults are prediabetic, according to data just released by the International Diabetes Federation in Brussels.From a global health perspective, that means that for 1,000 prediabetic people treated with rosiglitazone, 144 cases would be prevented, the authors said — a huge benefit for a disease whose lifetime cost of treatment can run into millions of dollars a patient. People with diabetes have a very high risk of developing secondary health problems that are costly to treat, including heart attack, strokes and kidney failure.The profits to be reaped and the involvement of drug companies in financing the study raised concerns in some quarters. Martin Silink, president of the International Diabetes Federation, declined to comment on the study “because it was sponsored by drug companies,” said Anne Pierson, an organization spokeswoman.Dr. Gerstein, the study coordinator, took issue with the notion that the trial was a drug company study, noting that it was conducted and financed under the auspices of the Canadian Institutes of Health Research, which routinely solicits co-funding for drug trials. Three drug companies — Sanofi-Aventis, GlaxoSmithKline and King Pharmaceuticals — provided financing.GlaxoSmithKline, which holds the patent on rosiglitazone, is coordinating a publicity program around the study release, and many of its top executives flew to Copenhagen for the presentation Friday. “We didn’t know what to expect from the study but now we are very excited because the data are very compelling indeed,” said Lawson Macartney, a senior vice president. But he said it was premature to promote the drug for preventive purposes, and the drug maker cannot legally do so until it has been approved by regulatory agencies in Europe and the United States for that use.Before seeking approval, he said, the company would “first like to see the data and then get the wisdom of the scientific community.” Rosiglitazone, which makes cells more sensitive to insulin, has been used for more than five years to treat people who have Type 2 diabetes, but this is the first time it has been studied on a large scale to prevent the disease.The risk factors for Type 2 diabetes include a close family member with the disease; overweight, particularly if fat concentrates in the abdomen rather than in the hips and thighs; and problems with glucose absorption during pregnancy.'"

Ms. Ballad saved money by trading services with other businesses. “We had our legalese written by a wonderful attorney, and in exchange we did her search engine optimization,” she said. “We’re both happy, and cash flow is untouched.”Kim Francis also barters for services. Ms. Francis, of Columbus, Ohio, started her consulting business, KAF Enterprises, in 1997 with virtually no start-up money. “I bartered with a local printing company for paper,” she said. “I joined all the small-biz organizations I could, and we all bartered with each other for services. For example, a local I.S.P. hosted my Web site and my husband did tech support for them, and a Web design firm did my Web sites and my client’s Web site at a huge discount, and in exchange I did their brochures and my husband did their bookkeeping.”Tony Wright, vice president for client services at Kinetic Results, a marketing and advertising company, says ingenuity went a long way in helping the company get off the ground in late 2005. Mr. Wright and several of his former co-workers had all found themselves unemployed at the same time, so they banded together to form their own company.They had the brains and the background, but lacked a big bankroll. “We found that raising capital with no clients and just your reputation is difficult at best,” he said. “We all scraped our savings together and began hitting the pavement. Our first office was a room at the Homewood Suites in Addison, Tex., where we strategized on long pieces of paper bought from Kinko’s and taped to the wall because we didn’t have a white board.”The enterprising group soon heard of an office available nearby. “The room was about 11 by 15, and three of us worked there for three months,’’ Mr. Wright said. “We used all our own computers and got business cards from an online printer that put a special protective coating on them. These cards could literally be held underwater and not get wet.”The group called in lots of favors and continued to work on establishing the company, soon landing their first client while still based in their tiny office.“Finally, we landed some big clients and are now in our present larger space in Addison,” Mr. Wright said. “We are still very budget-conscious — we have VoIP phones that don’t work well, all our furniture is from Ikea and we moved into an ‘as is’ situation and fixed the place up ourselves — but we are doing well.” The company has just opened its second office, in New York City.James Hills relied on the same entrepreneurial spirit after quitting his job last year. He and his wife, Heather, decided to start their own business, MarketingHelpNet.com, which helps small-business owners market themselves. Mr. Hills, located in Bartlett, Ill., made an office from a former storage room, and built his desk into a closet, giving him an extra few feet of valuable work space. “Also, I am using Vonage for both my fax and voice, which is great because of free long-distance to Europe and low costs to Asia for some of my contractors,” he said, referring to the broadband provider that uses “voice over Internet protocol” to offer phone and online connections.Some businesses do not actually need a fancy physical space, but would like clients to envision them working in a professional environment. In this case, a virtual office like those offered by Micro Office Solutions can help. With this service, businesses receive a business phone number — answered by a receptionist — plus voicemail and a company mailing address. In many cases, this is a desirable address, perhaps on Park Avenue in New York. The mail is then forwarded to the business’s actual location. Companies like The Regus Group offer several virtual-office packages, including some that include access to furnished offices, conference rooms and other facilities for occasions like client meetings.FURNISHED-OFFICE companies like Sunshine Suites can help businesses that need a full-time location, but can’t afford a traditional office. For less than $300 a month (with no long-term commitments) you can rent a private cubicle at one of Sunshine’s locations in New York. The rent includes business essentials like Internet access, technical support, printers and office equipment and other amenities. For $700 a month, you can get an entire private office.Bottom line: do your homework, and odds are you can find bargains or freebies for almost every office essential you need to get your business off the ground.“With some creativity and research, you can run a small office efficiently without much money,” Ms. Francis said. “And your clients will never know the difference.”'"
"'06-09-17,'0','Much attention has been focused on the economics of selling digital versions of Hollywood movies (like in Amazon’s new Unbox service) as an alternative to DVD sales and rentals and to stem piracy. But what has yet to be exploited — what Google, Yahoo and many other aggregators are vying for — are pieces of the $60 billion or so that will be spent on television advertising in the United States this year.NBC’s new syndication business, dubbed NBBC, for National Broadband Company, promises to match up content creators with Web sites that might be interested in showing the video. All three parties will get to take a cut of the embedded advertising revenue. There is much to quibble with about the way NBBC came out of the gate; its executives dissed most blogs as unworthy of their content and sneered at the homemade content that is proliferating on YouTube.On the other hand, any video service using NBBC is nonexclusive, so there is really no reason not to use it (which explains why little corners of NBC competitors like Fox and CBS are participating in the NBBC rollout, through their IGN.com and CSTV businesses, respectively).Some aspects of the NBBC concept can lead to head-scratching. If I have a great piece of video on my Web site, for instance, is it more valuable to syndicate it through NBBC or to just have it spread virally across the Web? A simple link will take people to the video and any ad accompanying it for free. But that’s why it’s an experiment.The clever thing about NBBC, though, is that it’s an entirely new business — to the extent it will distribute other companies’ programs — that is designed to bring in new money. Even if free advertiser-supported video on the Web takes off, it’s far from clear whether those ad dollars will be greater than the dollars NBC may lose from viewers who will no longer watch its show on regular TV, or download or DVD and so on.Which brings us to Apple’s potential convergence-buster, dubbed iTV (the name is — you guessed it — beta). Betting against Steven P. Jobs has not been a sound proposition in recent years, but there are plenty of reasons to be skeptical about whether iTV, which doesn’t actually exist yet, will have the technological wherewithal or enough compelling content to matter. But it does draw people closer to a world where inexpensive liquid crystal displays will moot the long-running debate about convergence because people will just plug in their cable or Internet or Wi-Fi and do what they please.“The real win here is in high-value, high-quality, high-definition content on your TV set,” said Josh Bernoff, a vice president at Forrester Research. “To do that is going to require more than what Amazon and frankly more than what Apple is doing. We’re still waiting for that device.”Or maybe it’s here and we just can’t afford it. TiVo last week brought to market its Series 3 digital recording box, which appears to have the ability to do everything from record in high-definition to take video files through a broadband Internet connection either directly or wirelessly. At $799, however, it’s the most expensive TiVo toy yet.And if you want to really — really — get your hands on as much video as one could possibly enjoy, may I recommend the new DirecTV Titanium service? Introduced recently as the ultimate luxury for anyone who calls their home a “crib” with a straight face, it’s basically everything the satellite provider has to give for a flat fee of $7,500 a year.That means every regular, pay and high-definition channel, every sports package, pay-per-view movies (at no cost), and a whole bunch of tuners and digital video recorders to do with as you please. There is also 24-hour a day “concierge” service for technical help and anything else.Best of all, none of it is in beta.'"
"'06-09-17,'0','Of course, it would be nice not to have to rely on cartels and circumstances to make us moderate our consumption. Hefty taxes on carbon-based energy, the proceeds of which could fuel research into nonfossil alternatives, would be a much better approach, since then at least we’d be paying ourselves instead of our friends at the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries. As a bonus for saving the planet, we might even undermine the intolerance and autocracy that are abetted in many places by oil money.The sad fact is that just as oil is the lifeblood of Western economies, oil revenue often is the lifeblood of tyranny. Oil-rich regimes that trample the rights of women, finance terrorism and preach intolerance are sustained by what we spend on gasoline and heating oil. The unfortunate paradox is that moderating oil prices, while they may reduce the earnings of despots in the short run, will only support our harmful addiction — and the power of those same despots — in the long run.If that were the only bad thing resulting from lower oil prices, it would be sufficient. Ah, but there’s so much more. Lower oil prices would promote more driving, for instance, a dismal outcome that would increase air pollution and, in all likelihood, highway fatalities. More than 43,000 people were killed on United States roads last year, and 2.7 million were injured. Many thousands die annually from airborne pollutants as well.Then there’s sprawl. Cheaper gas will mean more far-flung, automobile-dependent communities. That will bring more driving still, which will result in even more pollution and accidents. This is to say nothing of the health effects associated with driving everywhere instead of walking.All that driving brings us back to global warming. Fossil fuels are implicated in what appears to be significant human-induced climate change. Everyone I know professes to worry about this, but let’s face it: nothing but drastically higher prices will deter most of us from consuming more carbon-based energy. Meanwhile, oil prices remain distressingly low. Adjusted for inflation, remember, prices peaked some 25 years ago.HIGHER prices have worked wonders before. Today, Americans can generate a dollar of gross domestic product using just half the energy required in 1973, that watershed year of the oil embargo and lines at gas stations. In countries where energy is more expensive, a dollar of G.D.P. requires considerably less energy still. Unlike a tax, moreover, higher prices have the advantage of applying all over the world, to everyone.The burden of higher oil prices, unfortunately, will fall most heavily on the world’s poor — but then again, so would the burden of climate change. And surely the poor would benefit from technologies that provide alternatives to fossil fuels.The good news, meanwhile, is that many of the world’s poor are joining the middle class, so that they too can drive everywhere and enjoy air-conditioning when they arrive. Perhaps their newfound affluence will do us the favor of driving up oil prices before it’s too late.'"

Filson may be as concentrated on function as its wool vests suggest, but Williams reveals that the top ZIP code for catalog deliveries isn’t grizzly country — it’s Manhattan. (In other wool-vest news, Woolrich, the 176-year-old Pennsylvania company that once bundled up frontiersmen and today supplies fabric for Civil War re-enactors’ uniforms, did a brisk business at Bergdorf Goodman last fall.)American designers are also looking homeward for inspiration. It was the quest for the ideal pair of chinos that lured Michael Bastian from his position as the men’s fashion director at Bergdorf Goodman to start his own namesake men’s-wear label. “Look at Frank O’Hara,” Bastian says, referring to the New York School poet and Cedar tavern regular. “You see these pictures of him, and he was so beautifully put together, very traditional, wearing old Brooks Brothers, an old rumpled-up raincoat, a perfect white oxford button-down.” In his search for paragons, Bastian recently worked with an Italian mill to produce Nantucket red pants that look as if they’ve spent 10 years fading in the sun.There is a clear sense of nostalgia in dressing up in khakis and duck boots. It harks back to the Kennedy era and beyond, a simpler time when this country represented the American dream rather than the evil empire, a time before global warming, globalization and military quagmires.

"'06-09-17,'0','“I’m not an activist,” said Mr. Heckscher, who works as a finance manager for an online retailer. “I just think there should be a nicer feeling here than in the subway.”The council’s campaign, which started in July, has put pressure on Gov. M. Jodi Rell and the Department of Transportation, which is landlord to the state’s 36 Metro-North stations, to fulfill their promise to give a thorough once-over to every station and fix any problems.Still, the inspections are not happening fast enough and are not involving enough actual riders, said James Cameron, the council’s chairman.He said he hoped to present the governor eventually with an album of the photos he has collected.“I’ll say, ‘Here’s your punch list; let’s start working on it,’ ” Mr. Cameron said. “We will not be ignored.”So far, though, response to his efforts has been somewhat tepid, a function of what he called a nonexistent marketing budget. Although his Web site highlights 15 stations, only 12 people have contributed photos.A quick look around the Cos Cob station earlier in the summer, with Mr. Heckscher as a guide, revealed so many faults that it is perhaps surprising that more riders have not joined the cause.Next to the northbound tracks, for instance, graffiti marred the windows of a shelter whose floor was littered with dried orange peels and pages of old newspapers. On the southbound side, rust had blossomed on the large red and white metal signs that let travelers know they have arrived at their destination. On both sides of the tracks, locks were missing from the bent-open doors of the blue trash bins.Cos Cob is hardly alone. From Darien to Waterbury, according to the online photo gallery, stations need repairs. In Fairfield, commuters took pictures of exposed wires and a rusted roof. In Noroton Heights, there were exposed wires, along with cracks in the concrete platform and on the steps. Trash accumulated under the Talmadge Hill platform. And graffiti covered station signs and the platform in Riverside. Other stations in the photos include Greenwich, New Canaan and Stamford.In a $1.6 million report released in May 2005, the Transportation Department admitted that the stations were not in the best of shape. But a department spokesman, Kevin Nursick, said towns that lease the stations from the department — with only two exceptions — are responsible for keeping them up.“They take care of the day-to-day stuff,” Mr. Nursick said, “like trash and light bulbs and maintenance items.”'"

"'06-09-17,'0','So far as I know, my department, like many university departments of English, consists of wall-to-wall Democrats. If my faculty colleagues have any good words to say about George Bush’s fiscal or foreign policies, they’re keeping them to themselves.Every year around this time, you’ll hear complaints about the liberal campus elite — usually from the political right, one wing of which has talked itself into believing that, as George Will phrased it in The Washington Post two years ago, “Many campuses are intellectual versions of one-party nations — except such nations usually have the merit, such as it is, of candor about their ideological monopolies.” The political tilt of American college faculties is a fact well established, though the actual ratio of liberals to conservatives — just under 3 to 1, according to the most comprehensive survey, conducted by U.C.L.A. researchers — is routinely exaggerated (10 to 1! 20! 30!) by those who believe that we liberals are actively conspiring to keep dissenting voices off the faculty roster. But the truth is that no one knows what the applicant pool looks like. For all we know, in the arts and humanities (and even some of the biological sciences), the number of bright young conservative aspirants may be no greater than it is for your average Broadway production of “Torch Song Trilogy.” But charges of pervasive “liberal bias” on campus tend to play better than demographic reports on how young conservatives go about choosing their career paths, so every year the preponderance of Democrats in English departments is trotted out as if it were a decisive refutation of everything for which liberalism claims to stand.Last year, legislators in my home state, Pennsylvania, were so perturbed by reports of liberal bias that they created a House committee on academic freedom to determine whether conservative students were subject to discrimination at Pennsylvania’s public universities. In one way, the very formation of the committee was a triumph for conservative culture warriors — in particular, the conservative culture warrior David Horowitz, who has spent the past three years promoting his “Academic Bill of Rights,” which seeks to protect students from “biased” courses and lecturers. But the committee also dealt a blow to Horowitz’s campaign: in his own testimony to the committee, Horowitz himself admitted that he had no evidence for his claim that a Penn State biology professor subjected his class to Michael Moore’s “Fahrenheit 9/11” on the eve of the 2004 election, and Penn State revealed that it had received all of 13 student complaints about political “bias” over the past five years — on a campus with a student population of 40,000. Those 13 complaints didn’t fit any clear red-blue pattern either: a Muslim student suggested that a professor was disrespectful to Islam; another student said that a professor was too conservative.Last February, Horowitz also published “The Professors: The 101 Most Dangerous Academics in America,” a book in which I was pleased to be included — until I learned that the dangerous were merely listed alphabetically, and that I was not assigned a rank or degree of dangerosity. And every so often, someone on the academic left does Horowitz and company the favor of saying something foolish or simply outrageous about 9/11 or Iraq, and the grist meets the mill once again.Whenever that happens, people lose sight of two critical features of campus life. The first is that most cases of “politically correct” limits on student speech do not involve radical teachers in the classroom; rather, they tend to arise from clashes between students and university administrations, as when a Penn State art student was told by a campus gallery that he could not exhibit his paintings of various Palestinian leaders, which he’d titled “Portraits of Terror” (a decision later reversed). Sometimes, when college administrations and student-affairs offices ask that everyone treat everyone else with civility and respect (whether out of liberal convictions, or a simple desire to keep the boat from rocking), they do it incompetently or counterproductively. But those episodes are not the work of Dangerous Professors.The second is that classroom dynamics are more dynamic than most accounts admit. In a discussion of Richard Powers’s novel “Prisoner’s Dilemma,” I had a student who insisted that the wartime internment of Japanese-Americans was perfectly justified; in a class on bioethics, a colleague of mine had a student who complained that the class wasn’t doing justice to all the benefits of experimenting on unwitting human subjects. There is no easy way for professors to handle these remarks, no matter what their political convictions; all we know is that we must try to treat our students fairly — and try to make sure their peers treat them fairly, a far more difficult task — even when they say things we might consider uninformed or obnoxious, no matter where on the ideological spectrum those remarks might fall.'"

The conference aimed at creating an international treaty limiting the trade in small arms — weapons designed for personal use, which cause about a thousand deaths worldwide each day. But after intensive debate, and despite the support of many nations, even the normally sunny Kofi Annan had to admit that the conference had collapsed or, as he put it, had “ended without agreeing on an outcome.”One group represented at the conference had reason to celebrate: the National Rifle Association, which in the past decade has been refining its own version of globalization. At first, the group openly fought gun control abroad, but that enabled gun-control advocates to accuse local gun lobbies of selling out to America. In Brazil, the N.R.A. tried a new approach. Brazil has the most gun deaths annually of any country, and last October it held a referendum on a nationwide gun ban. In the run-up to the vote, polls suggested that more than 70 percent of Brazilians supported the ban. Then the Brazilian gun lobby, which previously had emphasized the desirability of gun ownership, began running advertisements that instead suggested that if the government could take away the right to own a weapon (though Brazilians have no constitutional right to bear arms), it could steal other civil liberties. This argument took gun-control advocates by surprise, and on voting day, 64 percent of Brazilians voted against the gun ban. “We gun-control groups failed to anticipate this idea of focusing on rights,” admits Denis Mizne of Sou da Paz, a Brazilian public-policy institute. As a report in Foreign Policy revealed, the National Rifle Association lobbyist Charles Cunningham had traveled to Brazil as early as 2003 to impart strategy to local gun advocates, teaching them to emphasize rights instead of weapons.Around the world, the N.R.A. is finding that a rights-based approach translates into many languages. As the N.R.A.’s executive vice president, Wayne LaPierre, says: “They made the rights argument [in Brazil.] They made the argument that this was being taken away from the people.” He pauses. “It caught Iansa” — the International Action Network on Small Arms — “by surprise. They already had the Champagne on ice.” In the mid-1990’s, the N.R.A. became a nongovernmental observer at the United Nations and helped form a global coalition of pro-gun groups to match disarmament coalitions. At U.N. conferences, this coalition then uses success in national referendums to argue against global treaties. “The vote in Brazil on last Oct. 23 was a mandate,” the head of one gun-advocacy group argued at the U.N. conference this July. “The international anti-gun community, especially powerful NGO’s, was intimately and extensively involved in supporting the gun-ban referendum. They lost. They did not receive the mandate.”The N.R.A. is in the conservative vanguard: in recent years many conservative groups have been increasingly willing to engage abroad. Going global has several advantages. Organizations get more leverage over U.S. policy: conservative groups’ growing knowledge of H.I.V. issues in Africa has given them more say over America’s global AIDS policies, leverage that conservatives have used to press abstinence as a leading strategy. Going global also can provide a defense against the influence of international law, which judges like Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer have increasingly introduced into American courts. Conservative legal organizations like the Alliance Defense Fund have headed to countries like Sweden to combat international precedent on issues ranging from human cloning to home schooling. And conservatives now realize that by co-opting the language of rights, traditionally employed by the political left, they can export their own ideas of universal rights, whether that means the White House’s democratization program or a universal right to bear arms.'"
"'06-09-17,'0','“He’s not good sitting still, though,” Ms. Baseman said. “We drove an hour and a half to get here, but it will be worth it if he gets in. In the classes at home the students are always told to look pretty, but one time a male teacher came to class and told him to look proud, and his entire posture changed.”Siobhan Stocks-Lyons, 12, and her parents, Tim Lyons and Martha Stocks-Lyons, came because they wanted Siobhan to have more serious training than she can get in Glen Cove, N.Y.Krystal Mackie, also 12, skipped her first day of seventh grade at Mark Twain Junior High in Coney Island, Brooklyn, because she wants to become a ballerina. Potential students generally come from all over the New York metropolitan region; this morning one made the trip from Nice, France.What Elias and the other students were about to face has changed little since Balanchine and Kirstein first opened the school’s doors. The qualities that make a good student dancer are the same, said Kay Mazzo, a faculty co-chairwoman, who began her studies at the school at 12, joined the company in 1961 and returned to the school to teach in 1983.It begins with the body. “We’re looking for what, eventually, a ballet company will want: proportion, long legs that can lengthen and stretch, if their feet are arched and flexible, if they can turn out from the hip,” Ms. Mazzo said. “We have to be very selective because there are not a million jobs out there, and you don’t want to take somebody and give them 10 years of training and then say, ‘Too bad.’ ”Until 1997 Madame Antonina Tumkovsky and Madame Hélène Dudin — former soloists with the Kiev State Theater of Opera and Ballet who came to the school in 1949 and 1954, respectively — held the auditions and set the basic format. Now Elias and the other students are greeted by Ms. Mazzo, Katrina Killian, Garielle Whittle and Sheryl Ware as they enter the large audition studio with floor-to-ceiling mirrors and a grand piano. The women all studied at the school, are all former City Ballet members and are now on the faculty.The students quickly took places at the barre. The women began by inspecting each dancer’s body. They lifted the 12-year-old Fiona Koch’s left leg at a 90-degree angle and then moved it to the side. They repeated with the right, pulling and massaging her foot and calf at the same time to judge the stretch.Ms. Ware whispered to her to turn and face the barre, and they repeated the prodding in arabesque. “Tendu to the right and to the left,” Ms. Killian said.The women stepped back and whispered to each other while the registrar, Alexandra Schierman, a former student and personal assistant to Kirstein, took notes. The teachers moved from child to child, spending several minutes with some and giving others only a quick glance. Ms. Ware then gave the students a simple barre exercise, snapping out the counts while the other women gauged the dancers’ skill level and musicality. Could they keep the basic four-count beat?The students’ performance made it clear how difficult basic positions can be. Stomachs hung out, spines slouched, elbows drooped, and wrists collapsed. The students cocked their heads like curious birds in every possible wrong direction. Several bodies shook as they tried to hold the pose. As Ms. Mazzo later said, “The simple act of standing correctly can take months to learn.”The process was repeated in much the same way for each age group, with barre and center work becoming far more complicated for the 13-to-14- and 15-to-18-year-olds who must have had prior training.“With the older students we’re looking not just at the body, but for coordination of movement, musicality, joy of dance, the whole body participating, or at least the potential to have that,” said Suki Schorer, who oversees the older students’ auditions with Ms. Mazzo and other faculty members. “But it’s hard to know what their training was before this. Sometimes they’ve had a bad teacher. So you look to see how they respond and how quickly they learn. Older kids may not know enough, and at 16 or 17 they may have taken a lot of ballet, but if they don’t have the technique, it’s too late.”Ms. Schorer and the faculty can afford to be selective. For the 2005-6 school year, which included the 10-month winter term and a five-week summer course, the school provided $1,015,000 in scholarships and subsidies.“We are not a money-making institution,” Ms. Mazzo said. “We’re looking for any dancer in the world with the desire and attributes to become a professional.”The $25 audition fee can be waived, and tuition costs for the term range from $1,825 to $4,215, depending on level and frequency of classes.“The school contributes everything,” said Peter Martins, the City Ballet’s balletmaster in chief and the school’s chairman of faculty and artistic director. “To be more specific, it’s over 90 percent of New York City Ballet’s roster, which is no small feat in the world of ballet.”FOR the youngest dancers — those 7 to 10 — the audition, which took place a week later, was brief and simple. The instructors inspected the children’s bodies and asked them to skip across the floor to music. Most of the children wore black leotards and tights, but several were in gym clothes and tennis shoes.One little girl was wearing a stiff tutu. Saskia Pedersen, 9, was dressed in a powder blue leotard and tight bun. Her father, Tom Ertman of the Upper West Side, said he was happy to bring her here.“I love New York City Ballet,” he explained. “Even before we had her, I had dreamed of her auditioning.” Christine Holo, also of the Upper West Side, who brought her daughter Johanna, 10, was a determined realist. “I don’t know if she’s going to be a ballerina,” she said. “I mean how can you tell when they’re 9 and 10?The faculty believes it can. And the dancers were surprisingly varied. Some legs go straight up to the nose and ear, while others barely budge above the waist, despite careful coaxing.Peter Boal, who retired as a principal dancer at City Ballet in 2005, vividly recalled the day in 1975 when, at the age of 9, he auditioned.“I don’t think anyone ever forgets,” he said. He started classes three days later, continuing his studies until joining City Ballet’s corps in 1983. “I had been at performances at New York City Ballet for years, and one day I just pulled on my mom’s sleeve and said, ‘I want to do that.’“I didn’t know what to expect at the audition. I had never done any ballet before. My only issue was, I just didn’t want to wear tights. So I wore jean short cutoffs and bare feet, and they let me in anyway.”“The time they spent looking at me had to be about two minutes,” he added. That night his father received a call from Madame Tumkovsky. “I walked in as 9-year-old and walked out as a 17-year-old member of the New York City Ballet,” he said. “It was all because of the school.”Not every student has such a positive experience. The discipline demanded at such an early age can take a toll on even the toughest psyches and most committed families.“My mom and I stayed with family friends in the city during the week, and then my dad would pick us up on the weekends,” said Jennie Somogyi, a City Ballet principal who auditioned when she was 8. “It was a huge a sacrifice for them. But because I could go home on the weekends, I still went to football games and had a kind of normal life. But I saw other kids lose interest and drop out.”Though the audition process has not changed dramatically over the years, the students have. “The older students’ technique is stronger, the extensions are higher,” Ms. Schorer said. “More students and parents are aware of S.A.B. and its relation to the New York City Ballet, and ballet has been legitimized as a profession.”When the new students start school on Monday, the levels will be designated by leotard color: Girls III, light pink; Girls IV, hunter green. There is a 300-plus-page syllabus for the first year alone, and the students must master certain fundamentals before advancing.They attend regular school at the same time, usually at the Professional Children’s School or the Professional Performing Arts School in Manhattan, and out-of-towners may begin boarding at the school at 14. The students have the opportunity to perform with City Ballet in “The Nutcracker,” “Swan Lake” and “A Midsummer’s Night Dream,” as well as in lecture demonstrations and workshops, all in the hope of being considered for the company.“It’s wonderful to watch them mature from the age of 8 or 12,” Ms. Mazzo said. “They’re young little kids, and then they’re teenagers, and then all of a sudden they put on makeup, go onstage in a workshop or performance, and you can’t take your eyes off them”Students do not have to reaudition, but “all the teachers and myself look at the kids every day, and we notice whether somebody’s improving or somebody’s not,” Ms. Mazzo said. “If somebody’s really not, we’ll call parents in. And that’s fine. You shouldn’t be there because what we do is very serious, and if they lose interest, then there’s a spot for somebody else.”Yet even with careful guidance these students face daunting odds. “In my first class,” Mr. Boal recalled, “there were about 23 kids, and by the time I was accepted into the company, there was only one boy and myself left. All the girls had disappeared.”Moments after auditioning, Elias Baseman was pulled aside and told he had been accepted into boys’ Level II. “The ronde de jambes were hard, but I felt confident,” he said of the audition. Elias starts class on Tuesday.'"
"'06-09-17,'0','I am 76 years old. I have lived through World War II, the Holocaust, the dropping of the atomic bomb on Hiroshima, the great civil rights movement and the protest against the Vietnam War. But the event that had the most impact, with the most lasting consequences, on my life and the lives of the next generation, our daughters and sons, was the feminist movement. To dismiss a creative work about these changes as trivial, as Alison McCulloch did in her review of my novel “In the Name of Friendship” (Sept. 3), is shocking. Since Ana Marie Cox did exactly the same thing to Katha Pollitt’s recently published essays, it appears that the new position of the editors of the Book Review is that feminism is an illegitimate subject for literature.'"
"'06-09-17,'0','“There is no sign of weaker consumer confidence raising the savings rate yet,” wrote Charles Dumas, chief economist for the United States at Lombard Street Research, an economic research firm in London. “People have not yet started to pull in their horns in response to house price horrors.”Home prices have not yet fallen nationwide, but have declined in areas like Florida and California. And most other measures of housing activity look ugly. Sales of existing homes declined 11 percent over the last 12 months; mortgage lending fell more than a third since June 2005; construction of new homes has plummeted.But consumers haven’t blinked. Spending jumped 0.5 percent in July; the sharpest increase since December of last year, exceeding consumers’ income by some $85 billion.Of course, rising employment and income this year have helped keep spending afloat. But some economists are starting to question the magnitude of housing’s impact on national habits of spending and thrift, concluding that the effect may be smaller than expected: tumbling home prices might not pull consumer spending into the abyss after all.To begin with, much of the money extracted by Americans from their homes was never spent. Some was used to pay down liabilities like credit-card debt, a sound strategy when credit-card rates are about 8 percentage points higher than rates on a typical mortgage and mortgage interest payments can be deducted from income when paying taxes.Money was put to other uses. One survey commissioned by the Federal Reserve of people who refinanced their mortgages in 2001 and the first half of 2002 found that only 45 percent had withdrawn any equity at all. About 26 percent of this money was used to pay down debt, 11 percent to buy stocks or other financial assets, 10 percent to buy real estate or make other business investments and 35 percent to finance home improvements. Only 16 percent of the money was used to finance consumption.This doesn’t mean that a decline in home equity extraction wouldn’t hurt the economy. Residential investment would decline. Consumption would probably respond to declining house prices in indirect ways.But relentless spending and a declining savings rate over the last few years seem mostly driven by other factors that occurred at the same time as rising home prices — notably, low interest rates — but were not caused by rising home prices. So the direct impact of falling home prices on spending is likely to be more muted than expected. “I think the slowdown will come,” Mr. Dumas said. “But it is likely to be much more slow in operating than is being supposed.”In one recent study, Vladimir Klyuev and Paul S. Mills, two economists from the International Monetary Fund, suggested that the long-term decline in the propensity to save in the United States has to do primarily with financial innovations that have made borrowing easier and quicker, reducing the need for precautionary savings.Mr. Klyuev and Mr. Mills untangled the effects of home equity withdrawals on savings from other factors, like inflation and interest rates, and found that for every dollar withdrawn from home equity, the savings rate declined by 20 cents in the short run but recovered in the long run.LOOKING at it the other way around, they found that even if the amount of home equity withdrawal plunged from its current level of 9 percent of disposable income to 1 percent — its long-term average — savings as a share of income would rise by about 1.25 percentage points. Consumption might decline somewhat as a result, but that would hardly be a devastating blow. “There will be a pick-up in savings, but it won’t be catastrophic,” Mr. Mills said.In America, the fable is likely to have a happier ending. It may no longer be the best of times, but consumers still own their homes and their barbecue grills — and the swallow still lives.'"
"'06-09-17,'0','France can once again celebrate the country’s rich history of interior design with the reopening of the Musée des Art Décoratifs in Paris, which was scheduled for Sept. 15.The museum, part of the Louvre complex on the Rue de Rivoli, has been closed for 10 years and has undergone a $46 million restoration. The building’s face-lift restored the nave, below, and provides visitors with 360-degree views of the city from its nine-story cupola.The more than 5,000 objects from the permanent collection that are being displayed have also been restored. Highlights of the collection are 10 period rooms, including a Louis XVI-style salon, a Gothic chamber and an Art Deco boudoir, all with period art and antique furniture. Lalique crystal, Sèvres porcelain and Christofle silver commissioned by Napoleon III is also on display.There are some 150,000 objects dating from the first to the 21st century in the collection, including designs by Le Corbusier and Philippe Starck. But even children should be happy here — the museum (107 rue de Rivoli, 33-1-44-55-57-50; www.lesartsdecoratifs.fr) has a toy gallery with more than 12,000 toys.General admission is 6 euros, about $7.85 at $1.31 to the euro.

"'06-09-17,'0','NEW York City can lay claim neither to popularizing the modern wine bar (London) nor bringing it to America (San Francisco). And, for a time, the city was known more for its winos than its vinos. But the last 25 years have been good to wine lovers in New York, so feel free to be picky, even finicky, during your visit.Need 200 choices by the glass, absolute minimum? Refuse to complement your Spanish reds with ham aged less than 18 months? Love Italian wine but take umbrage at Umbria? Insist on an alternative beverage selection for beer-guzzling traveling companions? No problem. Just don’t forget that New York also has many attractions not sold by the glass.A French wine bar in east Midtown with French wines and French food and a French vibe and French spoken — it’s a good thing for Le Bateau Ivre that the “freedom fries” lobby was never too strong in these parts. Though the waiters may banish you to the tiny round tables unless you plan to eat a full meal, they are helpful with the intimidating wine list, which has about 200 choices by the glass, according to the manager. And they’ll offer you a taste of a Languedoc-Roussillon red just as the servers at Baskin-Robbins will let you try the mint chocolate chip (minus the pink spoon). There are also charcuterie and cheese plates, a raw bar, tartines, croques (both monsieur and madame), foie gras and onion soup. Did we mention this place is French?The downstairs wine bar at the Peasant Wine Bar in NoLIta — the neighborhood named for being north of Little Italy — lives up to its name. The beams-exposed cellar with communal wood tables feels a bit like something out of medieval days, except that there’s no place to hitch your horse outside and that’s a Rosso di Montalcino you’re drinking, not a flagon of mead. Even though the main restaurant is upstairs, you certainly won’t starve, with a design-your-own-panini menu, pizzas and entrees and an all-Italian wine list that has helpful descriptions written in none-too-helpful minuscule print.Craving a post-Rockefeller Center glass of wine? No time to trek over to Third Avenue or dark corners of weirdly capitalized neighborhoods like NoLIta? Then go to the Morrell Wine Bar and Cafe, a two-level (plus sidewalk) bustling but spacious spot with a wine list that stretches over 20 pages and has by-the-glass options that range from about $7 to $70. The wines get nearly Faulknerian descriptions that make you wish the menu came with a Google toolbar for searches like: “chewy tannins” and “velvety espresso finish.”'"
"'06-09-17,'0','Today, it is widely believed that about half of Ethiopia’s 70 million people are Orthodox Christians (though some experts contend that Islam is now the predominant religion). In the northernmost province of Tigray, where the Orthodox religion took root, 3,500 churches cover the landscape, and the practice of Orthodoxy is nearly universal.For decades, however, access to the historic sites, and to Ethiopia in general, has been subject to the vagaries of politics and war. In the 1970’s and 1980’s, the Soviet-backed Marxist dictatorship known as the Dergue, led by Haile Mengistu Mariam, sealed itself off from the West, while torturing and murdering tens of thousands of opponents and presiding over the catastrophic 1984-85 famine in which one million people died.After months of fierce fighting, a coalition of rebel forces overthrew President Mengistu in 1991. (He fled into exile in Zimbabwe.)Over the next seven years, foreigners — mostly humanitarian aid workers, diplomats, journalists and hardy backpackers — trickled into Ethiopia. I visited the country during this period, when I was based in Nairobi as a correspondent, and it was a rewarding but rough experience — driving along bombed-out roads past the burned remains of Soviet tanks, staying in derelict hotels devoid of running water or electricity.The door slammed shut in 1998, when a territorial dispute between Ethiopia and Eritrea erupted in a savage war that lasted for two years. The conflict, which ended with a peace deal signed in 2000, left tens of thousands of soldiers dead on both sides.In the five relatively calm years since, tourists have returned to Ethiopia. They arrive in a nation that under President Meles Zanawi, the former leader of the guerrilla army that overthrew President Mengistu and who has been in power for 15 years, remains one of the poorest countries on earth.In Ethiopia, the per capita income is $120 a year; tuberculosis and other contagions are rampant; and the literacy rate is just 43 percent, a sad figure considering that Ethiopia was among the first societies in sub-Saharan Africa to develop a written language.But under President Zanawi, who has begun to show some dictatorial tendencies of his own, significant development has come to Ethiopia, including mobile phone networks, decent hotels, Internet cafes, reliable electricity, and asphalt roads — phenomena that were unheard of in the outlying provinces a decade ago.And it is now possible to travel across Ethiopia with some degree of comfort. Abercrombie & Kent, the Kenya-based safari specialist, this month is starting a guided tour through Ethiopia’s historic Christian route: Aksum, Lalibela, Lake Tana and Gonder.But those who want to venture on their own will discover that Ethiopia is reasonably well set up for independent exploring. They will find a proud, if bedraggled country with ruggedly beautiful landscapes and a unique sense of its identity — shaped in part, by Ethiopia’s stubborn refusal to submit to Western colonizers.I ARRIVED in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia’s 8,000-foot-high capital, on a cold, drizzly afternoon in early August, and flew the next morning in a 52-seat Ethiopian Airlines Fokker to Aksum in Tigray. I remembered Tigray, which I had driven through in 1993, as a bone-dry, high-altitude desert, a land of canyons and chronic food shortages. But this time, at the height of the wet season, the plateau was vibrantly green.“God has blessed us with two years of plenty of rainfall,” I was told by my guide, Sisay Ymer, a 30-year-old former seminarian who greeted me at the airport.As we rode into town, I could see terraced fields of teff, the Ethiopian staple — a wheatlike crop used to make the spongy Ethiopian bread, injera — extending across the rolling terrain in every direction.Aksum is a town of about 47,000 that is just beginning to recover from decades of war and political turbulence. Its decrepit appearance belies its rich history. Nearly 3,000 years ago, Aksum emerged as one of the principal cities of the kingdom of Saba, a prosperous commercial state centered in Yemen that controlled the main trading routes between the Red and Mediterranean Seas.The town’s best-known ruins date to the reign of the first Christian king, Ezana, and his successors: a field of dozens of granite obelisks, between 10 and 90 feet high, intricately carved with rune-like geometric shapes. This strange and mystical place, a cemetery for aristocrats and monarchs, is honeycombed with crypts and treasure vaults that lie several dozen feet underground.The grandest of these stelae, 78 feet high and weighing 160 tons, was carted off to Rome by Mussolini’s invading army in 1937. But last year, after a decade of pressure by the Ethiopian government, Italy returned the stolen treasure to Aksum, touching off days of celebrations.The stela was cut into three pieces by the Italians to make it easier to transport back to Aksum, and the three immense blocks still lie in a corner of the field, wrapped in their steel and wood shipping materials, while the cash-strapped Ethiopian government keeps delaying its plans to raise the obelisk again.Just across from the field stands the Church of St. Mary of Zion, a vine-shrouded stone structure built in the 1600’s. The basilica replaced the original fourth-century church — believed to be sub-Saharan Africa’s oldest — which was burned down by an invading Arab army in the 10th century.Across from the church is the building known simply as the Treasury, whose nondescript appearance hides its key role in Ethiopian Judeo-Christian mythology. Many Ethiopian believers insist that the building houses the original Ark of the Covenant — the gold-leafed wooden box encasing the actual stone tablets delivered by God to Moses on Mount Sinai. (Some Ethiopians insist that the tablets themselves are inside.)Menelik I, believed by Ethiopian Christians to be the offspring of King Solomon and the Ethiopian Queen of Sheba, is said to have stolen the ark from the First Temple in Jerusalem and brought it to Aksum a thousand years before the birth of Christ.No one but a single monk is allowed to see the sacred artifact — and few people are permitted to see him — though replicas, known as tabots, are brought out once a year for the Timkat celebration of Christ’s baptism on Jan. 19.The most revered Aksumite kings were Kaleb and his son Gabremeskal (literally, Slave of the Cross), who spread Christianity from the royal court through the villages of Ethiopia in the sixth century. My guide, Sisay, who was incongruously clad in a bright red jacket and tie, black slacks and shiny black shoes — his official guide’s uniform — led me on foot up a rutted road to the ruins of Kaleb’s palace, at first glance an unimpressive pile of rubble.Then we descended a stone staircase into a network of subterranean burial chambers, constructed of huge, finely chiseled blocks of granite, that fit together as neatly as the blocks of a Rubik’s cube.Entering the musty vault, where the monarchs were originally buried, Sisay illuminated the passageways with a thin candle. Fifteen-hundred-year-old carvings of elephants and distinctive Aksumite crosses — formed by four delicately shaped, not-quite-touching petals — were still clearly visible on the granite walls.Wandering through the ancient burial chamber had evidently moved Sisay deeply. With his eyes closed, swaying back and forth, candlelight flickering against his face, Sisay chanted the Lord’s Prayer in Geez.After the hymn, we stepped back in the bright sunlight.“Can you feel this place’s holiness?” he said. “Ethiopian Christianity was born here.”THE next morning, Sisay woke me early and we set out from my hotel on a hike to the sixth-century Pantaleon Monastery, perched on a hilltop just outside town. King Kaleb spent the last two decades of his life in an ascetic retreat in this monastery, and his bones were eventually interred here.It was a bright, clear morning: we walked through vibrantly green teff fields, leapt across muddy irrigation ditches, passed the domed Church of St. Michael, built about 10 years ago. We climbed a steep switchback trail hemmed in by cactuslike euphorbia trees.The monastery, a one-story hut balanced on an outcropping with precipitous drops on all sides, was surrounded by a four-foot-wide ledge that offered panoramic views of the fertile Tigrayan plateau. Sawtoothed mountains rose to the east; to the north, obscured by mist, lay Eritrea.A wizened, barefoot monk appeared out of nowhere and opened the olive wood door with an iron key, revealing 500-year-old tapestries, and the vault containing the bones of King Kaleb — forbidden to my secular eyes.Aksum began to decline in the seventh century, and by the 11th century, the Aksum dynasty was gone. In the middle of the 11th century, a new Christian dynasty, the Zagwe, arose in the mountain town of Roha, which later was renamed Lalibela in honor of its most revered king.According to myth, Lalibela received a vision from angels commanding him to chisel 11 churches out of the soft limestone hills on which the Zagwe capital was built. Over 25 years, master artisans carved both cave churches from vertical cliff faces, and monolithic churches out of bedrock. In 1960, Unesco declared the churches a protected site, citing “a remarkable coupling of engineering and unique artistic achievement.”Lalibela had modernized since the last time I was there. A paved road, constructed in 1998, ran from a new airport terminal to the town, passing through rugged foothills, with jagged massifs in the distance soaring to 12,000 feet.Gone were the nausea-inducing hairpin turns and perilous rock slides that I’d experienced on the old, unpaved road back in 1993. Several hotels have been built, and the main street winding through the town has been paved — or rather, covered by an uneven layer of stones and cement.But Lalibela, with a population of about 30,000, still has the look of a destitute mountain village: round, thatched-roof mud huts, called tukuls, clinging to steep slopes; peasant farmers wrapped in homespun white cloth robes; goats and sheep that scatter frantically, bleating in distress, before the rare motorized vehicle.In this humble setting, King Lalibela’s 900-year-old creations seem all the more extraordinary. The Medhane Alem church, a 37-foot high, red-ocher edifice, has a cavernous interior broken by dozens of finely carved columns, arches and vaults.Inside, the rituals have remained essentially unchanged since the church was built. As the Mass ended, the scarlet curtain hiding the Holy Ark replica parted, and six priests, swathed in white satin, wearing yellow-fringed caps topped by tiny gold crosses, emerged from the alcove and headed toward the altar, which, unlike in most Roman Catholic churches, is in the center of the church. They carried urns filled with holy water and poured drops into goblets proffered by the beseeching crowd.One priest bore a six-foot-high silver ceremonial cross; two shook sistrams, bell-like instruments; another thumped rhythmically on a large barrel drum. Two elderly blind women, their eyes milky white, swayed against a pillar, while beside them, a cross-eyed boy wiggled his head back and forth, working himself into a trancelike state.Amid a crescendo of rhythmic clapping, ululating and chanting, the crowd spilled from the church into the open air. At that moment, thunder exploded nearby and rain fell in torrents, dousing worshipers and filling the gullies in the limestone courtyard.“You are lucky,” my guide in this area, Berhane, told me. “You have chosen a good day to be here.”Early the next day, I visited the Church of St. George, named after Ethiopia’s patron saint. Cut in the shape of a perfect cross, it is perhaps the most exquisite of the monolithic structures.Descending into the encircling trench via a narrow stone staircase, I noticed, in an alcove, a grinning human skull propped atop a jumble of bones. The partly mummified legs and feet reached to the very edge of the crypt.Deeper in the recess, other skeletons lay prostrate, yellowing skulls, femurs and tibulas intermingled with scraps of clothing. These were remains of five Orthodox Christian pilgrims, Berhane told me, who had trekked to this holy site from Alexandria in the 13th century, and had chosen to be interred in this open-air vault.“They wanted to spend eternity gazing at the church,” he said. “They didn’t want anything to block the view.”The next morning, I flew from Lalibela to Gonder, a bustling, ramshackle city of 250,000 in the Amhara-speaking heartland. It served as the center of Ethiopian Christianity from 1635 to 1855, at which point the capital moved to Addis Ababa.Gonder’s most celebrated monarch, Fasilidas, constructed an elaborate stone castle — a fusion of Moorish, Portuguese, Ottoman and Moghul architectural styles — on the outskirts, and his successors added their own edifices over the following century.The ruined castle complex, surrounded by a crumbling stone wall, contains such oddities as sauna baths and a dozen lion cages. Ethiopia’s rulers kept lions here until 1991, when the Dergue abandoned the city and left the animals to starve to death. Rebels managed to save two of them, and sent them to a zoo in Addis Ababa.Across town from the castle complex is Gonder’s other main attraction: the Debre Birhan Selassie church, constructed in 1674. A local artist at the time covered the small interior with brightly painted frescoes, recently renovated by Unesco, that depict scenes of the life of Christ, St. George and the Dragon, Daniel in the lion’s den, the beheading of John the Baptist, and the Devil and the damned. (Unbelievers, demons, and other unsavory types were painted in one-eyed profile.) Hundreds of beatifically smiling angels adorn the ceiling, each one painted with a subtly different expression.Gonder is also the cradle of traditional Ethiopian music, and I spent my last evening at an intimate bar called Ambasel, drinking beer and listening to a local band — a female singer, a drummer and a masinko player, whose one-stringed instrument is made of goat hide stretched taut over a box-like frame. Sewbesaw Zebene, my latest guide, translated the vocalist’s energetic Amharic song, a welcome to “the American writer” and a plea to spread the word about Ethiopia.“Tell the world that Ethiopia is a safe place,” she sang, “The wars are over.”Sewbesaw took a sip from his beer and told me he wasn’t so sure. That very week, he pointed out, Ethiopian troops had entered neighboring Somalia, and the radical Islamic regime that had recently taken power in Mogadishu was demanding that they leave.“The region is so unstable, every 5 or 10 years there’s a disruption — famine, war, and now, Somalia,” he said. “It makes us fear that tourism here is not sustainable. We worry how long it will last.”For now, at least, the ancient Christian route is open and thriving. But in this long-embattled land in the Horn of Africa, one can never plan too far in advance.Ethiopian Airlines (800-445-2733; www.flyethiopian.com) flies four times a week from Dulles Airport near Washington to Addis Ababa, the capital, with a stop in Rome. Recently, a mid-October round trip was $1,474 online.Ethiopian teams with Continental to fly to Addis Ababa from Newark through London. Several other airlines, including Emirates, Alitalia and Egypt Air, fly from New York to Ethiopia with a single stop.Ethiopian’s domestic service has improved greatly over the last decade. A fleet of turboprops does a daily Addis Ababa-Gonder-Lalibela-Aksum circuit. Flights are sometimes canceled because of rough weather during the rainy season (June to September), but the service is generally reliable, and the whole circuit costs around $400. You can book domestic Ethiopian flights in the United States.Tourist visas cost $40 for United States citizens and can be purchased on arrival at Bole International Airport in Addis Ababa. See www.ethiopianembassy.org for details.The amenities outside the capital are getting better, but they’re still pretty spartan. You’ll find a handful of decent hotels on the ancient Christian route; restaurants, except those in the best hotels, tend to be holes-in-the-wall, serving traditional Ethiopian food (typically injera and tibs, or spicy goat), spaghetti and not much else.At these places, pricing can be in either dollars or birrs (it’s about 9 birrs to the dollar), but dollars are accepted.In Addis Ababa, the Sheraton Addis (Taitu Street; 27-11-5171717; www.luxurycollection.com/addis), which opened half a dozen years ago, is the preferred destination of the upmarket tourist crowd. It has 293 rooms and suites, a sauna, 5 restaurants, 6 bars and outdoor swimming. Rooms start at $310.The Hilton Addis Ababa (Menelik II Avenue; 251-11-5518400 or 251-11-5170000; www.hilton.com), also very central, has been my hotel of choice over the years. There’s a great Ethiopian coffee bar in the lobby, a heated pool and pleasant grounds, but this summer two elevators did not work and it seemed a bit rundown. Its 356 rooms start about $130 a night.In Aksum, the hotel choices are minimal. The best is probably the Remhai Hotel (251-34-7753210; e-mail: remhot@telecom.net.et), a modern, concrete-block building with 74 rooms on the eastern outskirts; it has satellite television, sporadic Internet service and a decent restaurant. Doubles are $30.The alternative is the Yeha Hotel (251-34-7752377), part of the government-owned Ghion Hotel chain (251-11-5513222; www.ghionhotel.com.et). It is a pleasant place near the stelae, with 63 rooms, a good restaurant and that necessity in rural Ethiopia, a stand-by generator. Doubles begin at $40.In Lalibela, by far the best choice is another Ghion property, the Roha Hotel (251-33-3360009). Situated about a mile outside the center of town, it is beautifully decorated with artifacts inspired by the rock-hewn churches. The Roha has 64 rooms, a friendly staff and an excellent restaurant. It costs $40 for a double.In Gonder, the best hotel is the Goha Hotel (251-58-1110634), another part of the Ghion chain. Set on a hilltop with magnificent views of Gonder and the mountainous countryside, it has 65 rooms and a good restaurant. Doubles are $40.Probably the best alternative is the recently built Kapra Walia Inn (251-58-1120315). Within walking distance of downtown, it has three dozen rooms, with doubles for $27, and an Internet cafe.Just down the street from the Kapra Walia is the similarly priced Fogera Hotel (251-58-1116673), with a dozen rooms; doubles from $25. Unlike the Kapra Walia, it serves meals, though the food is mediocre at best.Ambasel, on Gonder’s main road, in the Piazza neighborhood, offers traditional Ethiopian music every night in an intimate setting. As long as you don’t mind being serenaded by the band, and attracting the amused attention of the rest of the clientele, the bar makes for a great evening out.In Aksum, Sisay Ymer was well informed and reliable. He should be booked in advance, especially for the tourist season, from December to February, at 251-34-7751501 or by e-mail at dnsisay@yahoo.com. His rate is about $40 a day, but negotiable.In Gonder, Sewbesaw Zebene (251-91-8770214 or 251-91-1827171; e-mail: sbsgdq@yahoo.com) charges around $100 a day.Abercrombie & Kent (800-554-7016, www.abercrombiekent.com) offers nine-day tours, “Ethiopia: An Ancient Dynasty,” for $2,995 to $3,255 a person, double occupancy, not including air fare.'"
"'06-09-17,'0','“It’s actually only 99 doors — they never found the last one,” said an elderly Greek man I had stopped to ask for directions. Before long, he was regaling me with stories about his native island as he escorted me to the giant church himself.This was my first lesson learned in navigating the island: ask a local. In most neighborhoods, street numbers and names simply don’t exist. Getting somewhere often requires guidance from Paros natives along the way.The teardrop-shaped island is rocky and arid, speckled with dry, thorny flora and roaming herds of goats — the source of the fantastic feta cheese that’s sprinkled throughout every menu. Though Paros is only 13 miles long and 10 miles wide, it is rich with ancient history, thriving towns and postcard-worthy harbors. The eastern edge boasts the island’s best beaches; to the north, the bustling town of Naoussa; in the center of the island is the ancient city of Lefkes. And the best way to see it all is by moped.The first stop is Naoussa, the hub of the island’s nightlife. Starting around 11 p.m., Naoussa’s bars and discos spill onto the narrow streets with revelers who don’t retire until dawn and sometimes 10 a.m. (no, really). By the way, all those places called Sex Club aren’t brothels, just discos.“We call it the spandex crowd,” said Lisa Kosta, owner of the trendy Caffe Latte. “It’s mainly young Greeks who go there and stay out until the next morning. Naoussa is today what Mykonos was 10 years ago.”But it’s not all cleavage and Jell-O shots. By day, the picturesque fishing town of Naoussa is also a great place to spend money. New shops like Korinna, an antiques and restoration store on the town’s main road, offer a needed respite from the souvenir bodegas — overstocked with surfer shorts, beach wraps and beaded necklaces — that have popped up all over the island.For the opposite extreme, head to the middle of the island, to the marble quarries of Marathi — an oasis of snowy white stone that makes the whole trip worthwhile. The quarries have been excavated for centuries for their spotless and pure marble. In fact, they provided the raw material for the Parthenon and the Venus de Milo. But somehow this enormous alabaster-colored mountainside, a place where Fred Flintstone might have gone to work, has escaped the collective eye of the masses — it’s rarely crowded. Go at midday, when the thin, dry light of the Mediterranean sets the mountainside aglow.But the main reason people visit Paros is the beaches. The Aegean Sea, which laps gently along the sandy shore, is aquamarine in Technicolor — warm, glittering and crystal clear right down to its rippled floor. The most popular are Golden Beach, on the eastern coast that is known for great windsurfing, and the nearby Pounda Beach, nicknamed Music Beach for its D.J.’s, dance parties and spring break atmosphere.Mykonos may have gorgeous beaches by day and wild parties by night, but Music Beach has both around the clock. On a recent Thursday, there was a water volleyball game under way, a wet T-shirt contest gearing up and bartenders pouring ouzo shooters everywhere — and this was 11 a.m.Since I haven’t been 22 in many years, I once again turned to the locals for destination advice. And once again they were more than happy to oblige. Several suggested Glyfa and Tripiti, two tiny crescents of sand and soft rock on the island’s southern tip. They are the nicest — and quietest — beaches in Paros. Dropping my towels and beach bag on the rocks, I dove into the Aegean, warmed by a season of sunshine. Two hundred feet from shore, the water was still as translucent and smooth as bath water.But Paros is still Paros, and in the far distance, the thud-thud-thuds from a beach party bounced over the water. The stranded-on-a-deserted-island fantasy ended.The anti-Paros is, well, Antiparos — a tiny island less than a mile off the western coast of Paros. With fewer than 900 residents, the islet’s claim to guidebook fame is its Agio Ioannis cave, a stony abyss of stalactites and stalagmites where Lord Byron carved his name. There are very few mopeds and cars in the main town, the streets are as narrow as sidewalks, and covering it all is a bounty of bougainvillea.After a glorious day of doing nothing much at all, I joined my fellow sunburned tourists on the ferry back to Paros. With the sun setting over the Aegean, I watched as tiny rowboats disappeared behind a mammoth cruise ship pulling into port.The next morning, it was time to leave. Just before I walked out of my hotel, the woman at the front desk asked me if I enjoyed my stay on her island and intended to return. “If you do, plan ahead,” she said conspiratorially, apparently letting me in on a juicy secret. “We can get pretty busy here.” I smiled and nodded. You don’t say.Paros is a three-hour ferry ride from the port of Piraeus in Athens. The most reliable ferry company is Hellenic Seaways (30-210-4199-000; www.hellenicseaways.gr). Ferries run at least once a day and one-way tickets are about 50 euros (about $65 at $1.31 to the euro), depending on the season. Delta and Olympic airlines fly nonstop from New York to Athens, with roundtrip tickets starting at about $900.Antiparos is a 30-minute ferry ride from Parikia, the port town in Paros. The ferry leaves every two or three hours. Tickets (3 euros) are bought on the boat.Levantis (Central Market Street, Parikia; 30-22840-23613; levantisrest@yahoo.gr) tops the proverbial food chain in Paros. Sit on the outdoor patio under the leafy canopy and order the baked lamb rolled in vine leaves, herbs and feta (15 euros).The best family-run taverna, on an island full of family-run tavernas, is Katsoynas (Santa Maria, Naoussa; 30-22840-51246). Sit on the patio and feast on salted sardines, crusty bread with ricotta, capers and tomatoes, and whatever seafood the owner caught that morning. Lunch for two, about 40 euros with wine.The main town of Parikia is dotted with small hotels and rooms to rent. The Asterias Hotel is clean and spare, and the family that runs it is happy to tell you about their island. Double room, 45 euros including breakfast (30-22840-21797, www.greekhotel.com/cyclades/paros/paroikia/asterias/home.htm). Few places have proper addresses; ask directions.On the northern tip of Paros is one of the island’s few luxury hotels: Astir of Paros, which features a three-hole golf course, helipad and infinity pool. It’s just outside the center of Naoussa. Double room, 225 euros including breakfast (30-22840-51976; www.astirofparos.gr).There are only six hotels on Antiparos, all within a few feet of the ferry port. The most central is the Hotel Mantalena (30-22840-61206). The rooms are small but the lobby’s seaside patio is airy and comfortable. Double rooms begin at 35 euros, not including breakfast.'"
"'06-09-17,'0','States generally do not ask about home equity when making those decisions, and the federal government stopped doing so during the Clinton administration.Heather McDonnell, the director of financial aid at Sarah Lawrence College in Bronxville, N.Y., said that like her counterparts at other institutions, she looks to other factors to determine if a student’s parents should take out a home-equity loan to help pay for tuition. “If you’re sitting on home equity of $500,000, but you could only afford a second mortgage of $100,000, that’s what we’ll be sensitive to,” Ms. McDonnell said.In addition, Ms. McDonnell said that depending on how large the institution is, parents may be able to discuss their situation with financial aid counselors if, for instance, they were planning on taking out a second mortgage to fix a leaky roof or pay for some other pressing need. “I’ve had someone mail me a picture of the house to show how much work it needed,” she said.Some college planning specialists caution against using home equity to pay for tuition. Carl Buck, the vice president for college funding solutions at Peterson’s publishing company in Lawrenceville, N.J., and the author of “Get a Jump! The Student Aid Answer Book” (2005), said: “I consider second mortgages a loan of last resort. If you lose your job, you lose your home.”But Rick Darvis, a founder of the National Institute of Certified College Planners in Syracuse, said that home-equity loans have tax advantages other loans lack. While mortgage interest is fully tax deductible, Mr. Darvis said, popular government loans like Federal Plus are more limited, and not just because interest rates for such loans are about 8 percent.Families who take out Plus loans can deduct only $2,500 in interest annually, and only if the borrower earns less than $135,000 a year. In addition, Mr. Darvis said, when parents take equity out of their homes, they decrease their overall net worth, which can increase the amount of financial aid that some colleges give in subsequent years.One advantage of Plus loans is that if the borrower dies or becomes disabled, the repayment obligation ends. “But if you go with home equity, you could take your tax and interest-rate savings and go buy some term life insurance,” Mr. Darvis said. “That way if you die, your loan is covered.”'"
"'06-09-17,'0','Over the past several weeks, I’ve found I can change the conversation at any social gathering by mentioning Louann Brizendine’s book, “The Female Brain.” Brizendine is a neuropsychiatrist and the founder of the Women’s and Teen Girls’ Mood and Hormone Clinic in San Francisco. She’s written a breezy — maybe too breezy — summary of hundreds of studies on the neurological differences between men and women.All human beings, she writes, start out with a brain that looks female. But around the eighth week in the womb, testosterone surges through male brains, killing cells in some regions (communications) and growing cells in others (sex and aggression).By the time they are three months old, girls are, on average, much better at making eye contact with other people and picking up information from faces. During play, girls look back at their mothers, on average, 10 to 20 times more than boys, to check for emotional signals. Girls can also, on average, hear a broader range of sounds in the human voice, and can better discern changes in tone.Later, girls are much more likely to use sentences that begin with “Let’s ...” while playing: Let’s do this or Let’s do that. They are more likely to take turns. Brizendine argues that of course culture and environment powerfully shape behavior, but brain structure and chemistry incline girls to pursue certain goals: “To forge connection, to create community, and to organize and orchestrate a girl’s world so that she’s at the center of it.”During adolescence, the female brain is washed in estrogen. Female teenagers, in general, experience an intense desire for social connection, which releases near-orgasmic rushes of oxytocin in the brain. They are, on average, more sensitive to stress (by age 15, girls are twice as likely to suffer from depression). The male brain, meanwhile, is producing 10 times more testosterone than the female brain, meaning the male sex drive is, on average, much greater.'"

"'06-09-18,'0','Jordan is partly modeled on Jamie Tarses, a former president of ABC who in the 1990’s rose and fell from grace fast, and was often unflatteringly portrayed in the press. Mr. Sorkin’s version of a young, pretty network boss has an amused yet otherworldly quality even when scheming or snowing her bosses: her skin glows, and her eyes shine like Gene Tierney’s in “Laura” or Jennifer Jones’s in “The Song of Bernadette.” Jordan seems lighted from within, only it’s not religious fervor; it’s the undiluted love of making good television.“Studio 60” has funny moments, but it’s a serious, at times sanctimonious look at show business, not at all like Tina Fey’s new NBC sitcom, “30 Rock,” which takes a farcical look at the same subject. The wisecracking heroes of “Studio 60,” Matt Albie (Matthew Perry) and Danny Tripp (Bradley Whitford), are brought back to run the show they left in high dudgeon four years earlier; under Jordan’s coaxing, they accept the job, determined to fight back against the mediocrity of television and the soulless hacks who run it.“I have no reason to trust you and every reason not to,” Danny warns Jordan at their first meeting. When she asks why, he waits a beat, then replies, “You work in television.”Mr. Whitford is one of several “West Wing” alumni also in the cast of “Studio 60.” It’s a bit jarring to see the same faces that applied a passionate zeal for political change crusading for better programming.And it is all the odder for being out of date. “Studio 60” is a polemic about television as a cultural wasteland at the very moment the industry is entering a new golden age.There is a lot more television than ever before, much of it bad, but it is hard to remember a time when there were so many good shows pushing up against the worst. Dramas especially, whether on cable or on broadcast networks, have never been as beautifully or thoughtfully made; few Hollywood movies come close. And “Studio 60” serves as exhibit A: it is gorgeously filmed, with the kind of long, sweeping tracking shots that used to be associated with Martin Scorsese and are now more often cited as a trademark of Thomas Schlamme, an award-winning director of “The West Wing.”When “The West Wing” began in 1999, it was notable for its sparkling repartee, dense dialogue and erudite references. Now there are other shows that aim as high. On a recent episode of “House,” a doctor argues that titanium can’t break into pieces, and Dr. Gregory House (Hugh Laurie) mutters, “Tell that to the guys on the Kursk,” referring to the Russian submarine with a titanium hull that sank in 2000.The dialogue on “Studio 60” has a slower, more stately pace than the “West Wing” banter, which is also surprising: the best comedy writers in Hollywood turn out to be not nearly as quick-witted and screwball as campaign managers and policy advisers in Washington.It doesn’t matter. The characters fill and lift the show, and even the more villainous figures, like Jack Rudolph, the chairman of NBS (wonderfully played by Steven Weber of “Wings”), cannot remain one-dimensionally crass for long. By the second episode, Jack displays an understated sense of humor and starts to steal every scene. “You have spunk,” he says to Jordan, quoting Lou Grant’s famous line from “The Mary Tyler Moore Show.” “I hate spunk.”Matt and Danny share the kind of unswerving loyalty viewers have come to expect from the creators of “The West Wing.” And those creators can expect viewers to become just as devoted to “Studio 60.” There is nothing else quite like it on television, and that is actually saying a lot.Created by Aaron Sorkin; Thomas Schlamme, director; Mr. Schlamme and Mr. Sorkin, executive producers; Eli Attie, co-executive producer; Mark Goffman, Dylan Massin and Patrick Ward, producers.

"'06-09-18,'0','If there are any cognitive differences, the report says, they are small and irrelevant. In any event, the much-studied gender gap in math performance has all but disappeared as more and more girls enroll in demanding classes. Even among very high achievers, the gap is narrowing, the panelists said.A spokesman for Mr. Summers said he was out of the country and could not be reached for comment.Nor is the problem a lack of women in the academic pipeline, the report says. Though women leave science and engineering more often than men “at every educational transition” from high school through college professorships, the number of women studying science and engineering has sharply increased at all levels.For 30 years, the report says, women have earned at least 30 percent of the nation’s doctorates in social and behavioral sciences, and at least 20 percent of the doctorates in life sciences. Yet they appear among full professors in those fields at less than half those levels. Women from minorities are “virtually absent,” it adds.The report also dismissed other commonly held beliefs — that women are uncompetitive or less productive, that they take too much time off for their families, and so on. Their real problems, it says, are unconscious but pervasive bias, “arbitrary and subjective” evaluation processes, and a work environment in which “anyone lacking the work and family support traditionally provided by a ‘wife’ is at a serious disadvantage.”Along with Dr. Shalala, the panel included Elizabeth Spelke, a professor of psychology at Harvard who has long challenged the “innate differences” view, and Ruth Simmons, the president of Brown University, who established a widely praised program for aspiring engineers when she was president of the all-female Smith College.The report was dedicated to another panelist, Denice Denton, an electrical engineer who until her suicide this summer was chancellor of the University of California, Santa Cruz, and a forceful advocate for women, gays and minority members in science and engineering.The 18-member panel had only one man: Robert J. Birgeneau, chancellor of the University of California, Berkeley. But Dr. Shalala noted that the National Academy of Sciences committee that reviewed the report had 10 men.“Nothing was a foregone conclusion,” she said, adding that the committee was surprised at the strength of evidence supporting the report’s conclusions. In an interview, Dr. Simmons of Brown said: “The data don’t lie. There are lots of arguments one could have mounted 30 years ago, but 30 years later we have incontrovertible data that women do have the ability to do science and engineering at a very high level.”She said the more relevant question is, “Why aren’t they electing these fields when the national need and the opportunities in the fields are so great?”Leveling the playing field does not mean giving women an unfair advantage, another panelist, Maria Zuber said. Dr. Zuber, a geophysicist at M.I.T., said for example that scholarly journals might eliminate the identify of authors when they send manuscripts out for pre-publication review. That way, she said, work would be judged on its merits, rather than by the prominence of its authors.Ana Maria Cauce, a psychologist at the University of Washington and another panelist, said at the news conference, “This is about more excellence, this is not about changing the bar or lowering the bar.”.Ben A. Barres, a neuroscientist at Stanford who was not connected to the effort, but who published a commentary on women in science last summer in the journal Nature, said echoed the report’s assertion that small administrative changes could produce big differences for women in science.He pointed to the Pioneer award program for young researchers run by the National Institutes of Health. Dr. Barres, who has been a judge for the awards, said even making it known that scientists could nominate themselves helped make the pool of winners more diverse.Dr. Shalala began the report’s preface by recalling that when she was in graduate school in political science the 1960’s and as a young professor she was told that fellowships or tenure would never be hers because she was a woman.Overt discrimination like that is now rare, she wrote, but progress has been too slow. “We need overarching reform now,” she said.'"
"'06-09-18,'0','The crew put on gloves and surgical masks, and were instructed to insert a charcoal filter into the ventilation system to scrub the chemical from the air within the station; that will help with the smell, too.The Elektron units, which are tanks the size of a small water heater, have often been a source of trouble for the station’s crews, and they have required regular maintenance and troubleshooting. When they are not functioning properly, astronauts have alternative ways of replenishing the oxygen in the station’s air: they can “burn” special oxygen-producing candles or tap the large oxygen storage tanks on board.Mr. Suffredini said he did not yet know why the crew had been working on the Elektron. “We’re trying to figure out why,” he said. “This Elektron has been working very well.”But the devices are sometimes turned off, and often require several tries to restart, he said.At no time did NASA seriously consider having the crew enter the Soyuz capsule attached to the station to abandon ship, Mr. Suffredini said, adding that the decision to declare an emergency was meant to secure priority for flight controllers on satellite systems.The first word of the problem came shortly after 7 a.m. Eastern time, when the alarm was set off. Mr. Williams reported to ground control afterward that “there was never any smoke, there was a smell and it was perhaps wrongly assumed to be a fire initially,” according to a partial transcript of the conversation published by CBS Space News.Mr. Williams said the reason the crew had at first thought there was a fire was that “the Elektron was very hot.”In a later conversation with Russian mission control about the device, Mr. Vinogradov said: “When I touched it, I thought, ‘What’s going on?’ I thought the secondary purification unit was overheated, but why? I decided to turn it off.”The reply from Russian mission control was, “Excellent — you did the right thing.”Mr. Suffredini said that the smell had spread through much of the station, and that it would take about 36 hours to recycle the entire atmosphere through the charcoal filters. The chemical will be cleaned up, double sealed and left on board until a departing spacecraft can carry it back to earth, he said.The next crew of the station — Capt. Michael Lopez-Alegria of the Navy, who will command the station, and a Russian cosmonaut, Mikhail Tyurin — lifted off from the Russian launch facility in Kazakhstan this morning, and will arrive at the station on Wednesday, bringing their passenger, Anousheh Ansari, a telecommunications entrepreneur who will be the fourth space tourist to visit the station.'"

"'06-09-18,'0','Health department officials acknowledge some problems but say they have made progress. “Medical discovery is an unpredictable process,” said Bill Hall, a spokesman. “It is the nature of science.”But some companies on the sidelines say the experience with the anthrax vaccine is exactly why they do not want to do business with Washington. Once optimistic about the president’s promise, many biotech companies and public health experts are now discouraged.“The inept implementation of the program has led the best brains and the best scientists to give up, to look elsewhere or devote their resources to medical initiatives that are not focused on biodefense,” said Michael Greenberger, director of the Center for Health and Homeland Security at the University of Maryland.Even some former department officials who helped create BioShield are dismayed.“I find this all rather repugnant,” said D. A. Henderson, a former top bioterrorism official. “You have people here who, in the face of a problem of serious import, are using every tactic they can to line their own pockets.”From the start, officials in Washington knew that Project BioShield would be a risky venture — for the government, the companies involved and even ordinary Americans, who might be asked to take relatively untested treatments in an emergency.Officials hoped $5.6 billion in federal money would entice companies to develop new drugs and vaccines for anthrax, smallpox, botulism, Ebola and other deadly diseases.Because of the perceived urgency of the threat, the project suspends some traditional standards. It allows new vaccines or drugs to be used in emergencies before completing the lengthy Food and Drug Administration approval process. Full testing on humans is also not required because it is too dangerous, even though that means no one will know with certainty whether the vaccines will work until used in a crisis.For their part, the companies have to take all the risks of developing and manufacturing new products; they get paid only upon delivery.At the top of the government’s threat list was anthrax, which killed five people, created panic and disrupted the mail system after letters filled with the powder were sent through the mail. No one has been charged in the attacks, which affected places including a tabloid publication in Florida, a New York television network and several lawmakers’ offices on Capitol Hill.“The top three threats, in fact, are anthrax, anthrax, anthrax,” Dr. Gerald Parker, a senior health agency official, said in an interview. If properly dispersed through the air, just a few hundred pounds of anthrax powder could endanger tens of thousands of people.After the letter attacks, the health agency bought enough antibiotics for 41 million Americans, but the recommended treatment augments those drugs with a vaccine. The government already had an anthrax vaccine to inoculate military personnel, but it involved six shots over 18 months, an unusually long course of treatment. While the F.D.A. says it is safe and effective, it can have nasty side effects. There have been reports among military personnel of six deaths and serious complications, including lymphoma and multiple sclerosis. The military stopped mandatory vaccinations in 2004 after some soldiers balked and filed lawsuits.“It is 1950’s technology,” said Dr. Philip K. Russell, the former acting director of the office that started Project BioShield. “We don’t drive Model T Fords anymore.”The first disappointment with the new anthrax vaccine occurred in early 2004 when bids to test and manufacture it came in. None were from big pharmaceutical companies; they considered the effort unappealing because the potential market was relatively small and profits limited. They were also concerned about liability if someone became ill or died after being inoculated. Project BioShield did not offer immunity from lawsuits.That left a handful of companies in the running, relatively small outfits with limited experience. VaxGen, for example, had never taken a drug to market. Its first major product, an AIDS vaccine, flopped in 2003. The company also had financial troubles; it was barred from Nasdaq in 2004 after managers uncovered accounting errors.The situation was hardly ideal, federal health officials acknowledged.“We are going to be working consistently with these smaller firms, and it’s going to require an enormous amount of government effort to get this product licensed,” said Stewart Simonson, then an assistant health secretary overseeing the anthrax vaccine effort.VaxGen argues that a company does not have to be large to successfully produce a vaccine. “We’ve repeatedly demonstrated that we have the capacity, expertise and infrastructure to meet the government’s needs,” said Lance Ignon, a vice president of the company, which is based in Brisbane, Calif.Instead of hedging its bets by dividing the work among several vendors, Health and Human Services awarded the entire $887 million order to VaxGen. It was to produce 75 million doses, enough to inoculate 25 million Americans.That decision fed doubts about Project BioShield in Congress and drew loud complaints that would grow into sharp opposition from Emergent BioSolutions, the maker of the old vaccine, which is based in Gaithersburg, Md.Then known as BioPort and based in Lansing, Mich., the company did not submit a bid for the new vaccine. Instead, it had been trying for months to persuade the federal government to buy hundreds of millions of dollars of the existing vaccine, its only major product. When executives learned that one competitor was getting all the work, they knew the company’s future was in peril.Soon, though, they found an important weapon for a campaign to recapture business.VaxGen’s vaccine was based on a modified version of the old one; Army scientists had genetically re-engineered it in hopes of making it safer and faster, with three shots instead of six. But VaxGen tests in early 2005 showed that an ingredient added to the vaccine caused it to decompose. It would not survive long in the emergency stockpile.VaxGen officials played down the setback, which delayed delivery to 2007 from 2006. “We are being called on to develop a vaccine in roughly half the time it normally takes,” Mr. Ignon said. “When you do that, you have to accept the fact that there are going to be some unexpected turns.”But Emergent officials capitalized on VaxGen’s stumble. They had already gotten health agency officials to agree to buy five million doses of their vaccine to add to the stockpile. Now they began pushing for a much larger deal, possibly replacing VaxGen’s vaccine altogether, company documents show.To lead its lobbying effort, which has cost more than $1 million since 2005, Emergent turned to Jerome M. Hauer, a top official at the health department until late 2003. While at the agency, he supported the push for a new vaccine. Now he was trying to persuade Congress and his former employer to buy the old vaccine.Explaining his shift, Mr. Hauer said VaxGen’s problems convinced him that Emergent’s vaccine was the best choice. In retrospect, he said, “The advice we were given was wrong.”Emergent hired nearly a dozen other lobbyists, some of whom had similarly useful connections. They included John M. Clerici, a lawyer who had helped shape the BioShield legislation; John Hishta, former chief of staff to Representative Thomas M. Davis III, Republican of Virginia; and Allen Shofe, a former tobacco industry lobbyist.The lobbyists argued that quality control problems at Emergent’s plant in Michigan had been corrected and that reports of serious side effects from the vaccine were unfounded. But mostly, they tried to undermine confidence in VaxGen.In a series of meetings with lawmakers and administration officials, they attacked their rival. “VaxGen has a history of failure and irregularities,” their briefing books said. “VaxGen has never produced an F.D.A.-approved product,” and its “vaccine is based on unproven technology,” leaving “the health and protection of the American public on a company with a history of scientific failure and financial scandal.”The lobbyists also criticized the officials involved in administering BioShield. In speeches and news interviews, Mr. Hauer questioned the credentials of Mr. Simonson, the health department official in charge of the program, and once called him the “Mike Brown of H.H.S.,” a reference to the disgraced former director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. (Mr. Simonson, who resigned this year, had worked as an Amtrak lawyer and as legal counsel to Gov. Tommy G. Thompson of Wisconsin, who was later head of the federal health department.)The lobbyists also charged that Dr. Russell, who helped start Project BioShield, had a conflict of interest. They said he had helped develop the vaccine as former director of the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research and then been instrumental in awarding the manufacturing contract after moving to the health department. (Dr. Russell says he retired from the Army before it began research on the VaxGen vaccine.)Fearful of losing the public relations battle, VaxGen increased its own lobbying effort. It hired Robert Housman, who had worked with Mr. Hauer to help Emergent open its anti-VaxGen campaign and then switched sides. But VaxGen, which spent $200,000 on lobbying last year, was outmanned by Emergent and put on the defensive.Senator Charles E. Grassley, an Iowa Republican and focus of Emergent’s lobbying, sent a letter to Health and Human Services Secretary Michael O. Leavitt that closely echoed criticisms of VaxGen that had first been raised in Emergent documents.Representative Davis scheduled a hearing last summer at which Emergent’s chief executive was invited to testify, but no one was invited from VaxGen. Mr. Davis said Mr. Hishta, his former aide, apparently did contact his office about Emergent. But he said he was not sure why only Emergent was asked to testify.Under pressure from Congress, the health agency agreed in May to double its order of Emergent’s vaccine to 10 million doses, worth $243 million. The next day, health officials demanded what VaxGen says are additional safety and efficacy tests that will further delay delivery by a year or two. Threatening to sue, VaxGen is seeking upfront payments from the health department or other concessions. If no agreement is reached, company officials say, the entire deal could collapse.“We understand this program is new and changes will have to be made,” said Piers Whitehead, a vice president of VaxGen. “But in our case, the goalposts were moved much farther than they needed to be.”Health officials said they were determined to see the anthrax contract — and other BioShield endeavors — through to the end.“There are people out there who feel like they are not getting a piece of the pie or that this is not running the right way,” said Mr. Hall, the department spokesman. “That may be. But to come in and criticize BioShield as a failing program because we have not spent all the money and don’t have all the products in the warehouse is completely and sorely misguided.”The maneuvering has been so intense, with lobbyists and media consultants helping the companies undermine the competition, even some of the people who have profited now express disgust.“This ought be driven by the science, by efficacy and threat, not lobbyists,” Mr. Housman said. “It has been shanghaied. And the implication is our national security is compromised.”Next week, agency officials will meet with industry representatives to discuss a new strategy for Project BioShield. Mr. Greenberger, the University of Maryland expert, and others argue that government agencies must determine more quickly what is needed for the stockpile and provide more financial incentives to lure the big companies and better support the start-up companies.Some in Congress say the improvements are much needed because Project BioShield has proven so disappointing.“A torturous labyrinth of federal fiefdoms into which billions disappear,” Representative Christopher Shays, Republican of Connecticut, said of the program. “Yet few antidotes have yet to emerge.”'"

"'06-09-18,'0','Over the past six years, more than 70,000 people, a vast majority of them of Palestinian descent, have applied without success to immigrate to the West Bank or Gaza to join relatives, according to B’Tselem, an Israeli human rights group that tracks the issue. Many who followed Mr. Bahour’s route and worked around the ban with tourist visas now have no legal way to remain.“These people are not really tourists — they are living and working without legal permits,” said Shlomo Dror, the spokesman for the Israeli government agency that handles Palestinian affairs.“I know these people have a difficult life living this way, and I feel sorry for them,” he said. “I think we can solve this when we renew relations with the Palestinian Authority, but right now, we are not talking to them.”Mr. Bahour acknowledges that he has options that others in the same situation may lack. His daughters, ages 12 and 6, are also American citizens, and his wife has a green card that would allow her to live and work in the United States. He and his wife own a second home in Youngstown, Ohio, where Mr. Bahour was born and raised, and his profession as a business consultant is portable.But the family is committed to building a future here, he said.“People ask why I don’t just leave,” Mr. Bahour said. “I tell them it’s because I want to make a contribution here.”More common are families in which one spouse has only a Palestinian identity document while the other has a foreign passport, making it difficult or impractical for them to live elsewhere.Many Palestinians say Israel is pursuing a systematic policy of limiting the population in the Palestinian areas, even if it means separating family members.“Most every Palestinian knows someone with this kind of problem,” said Sarit Michaeli, a spokeswoman for B’Tselem.In her view, the Israeli policy has several purposes: to apply political pressure on the Palestinians, to create a bargaining chip that could be used in future negotiations and to be a tool in a battle of demographics.The largest single category of people affected by the Israeli policy is Jordanian women of Palestinian descent who have married Palestinian men and want to move to the West Bank to live with their husbands, Ms. Michaeli said.Many of those women come to the West Bank on tourist visas and stay on after their visas expire. Complications arise when the women eventually want to travel or visit relatives in Jordan. If they leave the West Bank or Gaza, they face the risk that Israeli authorities will not allow them to return.Palestinians also say the Israel policy will keep out well-educated, middle-class and politically moderate members of the Palestinian diaspora who could play an important role in developing Palestinian society.Ali Aggad, a Jordanian citizen of Palestinian origin, has been working in the West Bank since 1999. He is now the general manager at the Unipal General Trading Company, which distributes consumer products for international companies like Procter & Gamble.For seven years, Israel has routinely granted him a tourist visa that has allowed him to spend weekdays working in the West Bank and weekends in Amman, Jordan, with his wife and two sons. Without warning, Israeli authorities denied him entry to the West Bank twice recently, he said.Procter & Gamble’s office in Tel Aviv is trying to resolve his case with the Israeli authorities, Mr. Aggad said, adding, “All I can do now is wait and hope it works out.”In the past few months, about 50 United States citizens have notified American diplomatic offices that Israel has prevented them from entering the West Bank, said Micaela Schweitzer-Bluhm, a spokeswoman at the United States Consulate in Jerusalem.“This is an issue we’ve been monitoring for several months, and it has been raised with the Israeli authorities,” she said.Many people of Palestinian origin sought to return to the Palestinian areas of the West Bank and Gaza after Israel and the Palestinians signed an interim peace agreement in 1993.Under a 1995 accord, Israel initially agreed to allow 3,000 immigrants to the Palestinian areas each year, as part of a family reunification process, said Mr. Dror, the Israeli official.Demand proved to be so great, he said, that Israel later increased the number to as many as 20,000 a year. Even so, there was a backlog of some 50,000 applications when Israel froze the process in 2000. Israel resumed allowing immigration last year, but soon froze it again when Hamas won power.One of the applications stuck in the pile is Mr. Bahour’s. He said he applied for permanent residency in 1994 and had not received a reply.Meanwhile, his current tourist visa expires Oct. 1, and Israeli authorities have written “last permit” in his United States passport.“I still don’t know what I’m going to do,” he said. But he will not leave if he can help it. “If I walked away now,” he said, “I feel I would be letting my community down.”'"
"'06-09-18,'0','One of them, Governor Mitt Romney of Massachusetts, said in an interview that he disagreed with Mr. McCain, and offered a forceful endorsement of Mr. Bush.“I am foursquare behind the president on this,” Mr. Romney said. “I believe that we should do everything possible to support those people at the front line who are responsible for enforcing the war on terrorism.”Mr. McCain said Sunday that he was acting out of conscience, not political calculation, to reinforce an image of independence that has been questioned in recent months as he has supported Mr. Bush on issues like the war in Iraq. Still, he said his office had been deluged with critical phone calls, and that he had picked up enough buzz from conservative radio talk stations to conclude that he might have once again rattled his support among conservatives.“I would imagine so,” he said, riding in a helicopter rumbling over the New Hampshire hills as it took him to a Nascar race at the New Hampshire International Speedway. “The radio talk show hosts have already been very critical.”Mr. McCain appears to be in a strong position politically as he takes on this battle. He has methodically been signing up supporters in crucial states in preparation for a 2008 campaign, part of a strategy to create a stampede to his candidacy. Although Mr. Bush has sharply challenged Mr. McCain and the other senators supporting him in the debate on interrogation tactics, the president and his aides have taken care not to attack Mr. McCain, in clear deference to his position in the party.“There is no acrimony with the White House,” Mr. McCain said. “I certainly consider him a friend. And I hope he considers me as one. We just have a disagreement.”Dan Bartlett, the White House communications director, said, “We would agree and believe the close working relationship and constant communication has kept it strictly to a difference over substance, and nothing more.”Conservatives are another matter. Senator John E. Sununu, Republican of New Hampshire, said conservatives would judge Mr. McCain on many issues, and that they did not expect to agree with a political leader on every issue — a reality he said Mr. McCain appreciated.Still, many conservatives have criticized Mr. McCain for his support for campaign finance legislation, his backing of what they believe are permissive immigration laws, and now this. “The question is being asked: in the midst of the most difficult and challenging war we have ever faced, can the nation afford a President McCain?” The Union-Leader — the largest newspaper in the state, which holds the nation’s first presidential primary — asked in a front-page editorial on Saturday. It was one of two editorials it published this weekend attacking Mr. McCain’s views.Mr. Romney has been making an increasingly vigorous challenge for conservative votes and is viewed by many Republicans as the strongest challenger to Mr. McCain, at least for now. He saw the interrogation debate as an opportunity to draw contrasts with Mr. McCain among conservative voters.Asked if this was his sharpest difference with Mr. McCain, Mr. Romney said: “No. There are a number of things. We have different views on McCain-Feingold, differing views on immigration policy, differing views on the interrogation of terrorists. There are also many other areas where we see eye to eye.”Told about Governor Romney’s position on the treatment of terrorism suspects, Mr. McCain noted tartly, “He doesn’t have a vote.”Mr. McCain said he was not overly concerned about the criticism. When an aide offered him a copy of the editorial as he rode in a car to the cocktail party here, he at first refused it, but a second later took it back and read it. And at the reception, he aggressively raised the issue, to decidedly light applause.“We do not believe we should change the Geneva Conventions that we have adhered to for 57 years,” he said. “I hold no brief for Al Qaeda. No.”“What is this all about?” he continued. “It’s all about the United States of America and what is going to happen to Americans who are taken prisoner in future wars.”Mr. McCain’s efforts have complicated one political component of the White House’s strategy: trying to bait Democrats into a battle that might allow Republicans to portray them as weak on terrorism. But Mr. McCain said he had not heard any objection from the White House, on political grounds, about what he was trying to do.“They know better than that,” he said.'"
"'06-09-18,'0','Mogadishu is still an edgy place, where machine guns and bazookas are sold openly in the market, and the signs of war are everywhere.Razor-straight avenues mapped out by the Italians decades ago are corridors of ruin, with crumbling, bombed-out houses lining the streets and giant cactus plants exploding from the ground floor windows. White plaster storefronts are freckled by bullet holes. Junked pickup trucks lie half-buried in sand. It is as if every single inch of this city of two million people, the country’s capital when there was a functioning government, was at some point violently contested.“That,” said a truck driver, pointing to a pile of scorched white blocks sitting on top of a hill, “is the old Parliament.”The new parliament, as it were, is the Shura Council, 91 sheiks from the major clans who have sworn their allegiance to the Council of Islamic Somali Courts, the new name of the Islamic government. They meet in a red-brick building.In a way, this is a watershed for Somali politics. Somalia is a thoroughly clannish society, split by rivalries that go back to the days when the clans roamed the deserts and fought over pasture land. The Hawiye clan, Mogadishu’s most powerful, dominates the Shura Council, but the Islamists seem to have done a better job than any previous government of uniting the major clans and subclans. Almost all Somalis are Sunni Muslims, and several business leaders said religion might prove to be the Somalis’ elusive connective tissue.“This is the one thing we all trust,” said Muhammad Abdi Ali, chairman of the Mogadishu chapter of the Somali Business Union, as he tapped a copy of the Koran.Somalis are legendary businesspeople, and even during the darkest days of civil war, they managed to turn a profit. The central government officially collapsed in 1991, and Mogadishu soon became the ultimate example of deregulation. Gutsy entrepreneurs, including some women, opened their own hospitals, schools (typically $10 a month per student), telephone companies, power plants and ports. There was even privatized mail delivery. Those risk-takers became the new class of moneylords.But doing business in anarchy has its drawbacks, like having to pay off a different pack of thugs every block or two. Ismail Goni, who owns an import-export business in Mogadishu, said that each time a shipment arrived, he had to hire dozens of his own gunmen to guard the cargo.“And we still lost 10 percent,” he said.This January, the moneylords decided enough was enough. When a group of clan-based warlords attacked El Maan port, north of Mogadishu, business leaders teamed up with Islamic forces who had been present for years, though mostly in the background as social service organizations.“The business community gave us their money and their lives,” said the Islamic Courts information minister, Abdulrahim Ali Modei. That alliance led to the defeat in June of the warlords, who had lost much popular support because of their banditry.As a thank you to the business leaders, one of the first actions the Islamists took was to reopen Mogadishu’s port and airport. On Sunday, as planes skidded to a stop on a runway near the beach, hundreds of workers at the port unloaded sacks of flour from the belly of a cargo ship.But it is not all smooth sailing. One complication is the Transitional Federal Government, based in the inland town of Baidoa and internationally recognized. Despite two rounds of peace talks, the two sides have yet to figure out a way to share power.Another problem is the mixed feelings toward the Islamists in Mogadishu. Several people said that they appreciated the order the Islamists have brought but that they were worried about the future. On Sunday, Islamist gunmen, trying to close down a movie theater showing a soccer match, shot and killed a 13-year-old youth, Agence France-Presse reported, quoting witnesses. The Islamists recently shut down a radio station for playing music and unveiled a strict religious code that bans women from politics.Idil Farah, a mother who runs an orphanage, does not like the sound of that. “But what can I do about it?” she said. “I don’t have any power.”Inside Somalia and out, the Islamic Courts have been likened to the Taliban, who rose to power in Afghanistan by bringing order, then turned to repression and terrorism.It is a comparison that the Islamic leaders do not necessarily mind.“The Taliban are our brethren,” Mr. Modei said.The business leaders, though, have a different view.“People here are free, freer than they have been for years,” said Mr. Muhammad, the shipping magnate.He said he had faith that the Islamists would continue to deliver peace — and prosperity.'"
"'06-09-18,'0','PARIS — The end could be near for Libération, the newspaper founded by the philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre and members of the extreme political left.After years of falling readership and advertising, the paper’s largest shareholder, Edouard de Rothschild, has stopped paying operating costs and, according to Pierre Haski, deputy editor of the newspaper, salaries have been frozen for October. “On Sept. 28, we hit the wall,” Mr. Haski said. “This seems too sad, but it is the reality.”Desperate for a solution and true to their political roots, the journalists last week proposed that readers help finance the privately held newspaper for a share of ownership.In June, Mr. Rothschild dismissed the newspaper’s longtime publisher, Serge July, and replaced him. Four of the newspaper’s most prominent journalists, including Florence Aubenas, who was held hostage in Iraq for five months, objected to the change and departed in protest in September.On Thursday, the staff appealed to both Mr. Rothschild and readers through articles and photos across two pages, plus a blog-style conversation as well as a live chat on the Internet. A 1,700-word article described the situation as unprecedented and appealed to Mr. Rothschild to invest in the paper.

The group of investors was led by Michael Parekh, founder of the Internet Research group at Goldman Sachs, who will join the company’s board. Other investors include Joshua Schachter, creator of the social bookmarking Web site del.icio.us that was acquired by Yahoo, and Bradley Feld, the managing director of the Mobius Venture Capital firm.The site has about 250,000 users (or 200,000 dogs, as the home page proclaims). Dogs, presumably aided by their human companions, may register for free or premium accounts, post photos, write in online diaries or use the forums to discuss issues from health and obedience to fashion and movies. Dogster and Catster are supported by advertising. Optional subscriptions, at $20 a year, let users post additional photos.Ted Rheingold, Dogster’s chief executive, said that the investment would allow his company to create more properties devoted to pets, like horses, fish and hamsters. (Hamsterster.com already exists.) “What we feel that we’ve learned how to do is connect people, mostly adults, about something they’re passionate about,” Mr. Rheingold said. “The real trick is creating an environment where they feel safe to explore their passions.”'"
"'06-09-18,'0','After entering the brand-hotel business in May 2005 and purchasing the GoCityKids.com city-specific online listings business for an estimated $1 million last December, Nickelodeon executives decided that they had an opportunity to expand beyond preschool parents.“We did the math,” Ms. Zarghami said. “We’re now into a real second generation. We think we’ve done a pretty good job establishing a trusted brand relationship with those parents, and the relationship really doesn’t go away.”There are many online sites, some tied to established magazines, offering ideas for toddlers’ parties and advice on child rearing. ParentsConnect.com, which is being linked to from the Nick Jr. and GoCityKids Web sites, hopes to create a community for the parents of children in all age groups, not just the very young, by turning parents themselves into experts, said Kyra Reppen, the site’s general manager.A sophisticated interface lets users search for discussion topics. Users who provide more detailed information by creating a profile receive updated and customized information each time they log on. A diverse group of 21 paid “host parents” moderate discussions and contribute to blogs on raising large families and fighting breast cancer. So far, just one thread had to be deleted after taking on what Ms. Reppen said were racist overtones.In a nonpublic test of the site over the summer by about 1,000 recruited participants, executives learned that these users wanted to blog; now, every user with a profile can, Ms. Reppen said. Through the beta test, which is now open to new members, Nick is learning that parents want spaces to sell their crafts, a separate Christian home-schooling discussion and bigger type on the Web site. Local discussion boards will be added, as will user-generated video.Ms. Reppen declined to say how many users the site had attracted, but noted that about 30 percent had created profiles. “It’s partly an educational process,” she asserted.The Nickelodeon name was kept off the site so as not to confuse parents, but may eventually be added, Ms. Zarghami said.The site, which is expected to have its formal introduction in January, comes at a time when the chairman of the parent Viacom, Sumner M. Redstone, has made clear that he expects his executives to aggressively pursue online opportunities.Ms. Zarghami acknowledged a mandate to grow through acquisition, but she said that Philippe P. Dauman, Viacom’s new chief executive, and Thomas E. Dooley, his deputy, “have said you definitely want to build and buy, it’s not just buying.”“Community sites are one of the big phenomena happening on line this year,” said Stephen Kerho, Nissan’s director of interactive marketing, adding that Nickelodeon “has a great platform with parents and kids to build off of.”Ms. Zarghami declined to say how much the company was investing, but said it was small compared with the costs of tapping into “the muscle of the marketing machine.” Asked when it will make money, she replied, “I’m optimistic that it shouldn’t take much more than a year.”'"
"'06-09-18,'0','To anyone who has been paying attention, the Interior Department’s tolerance of “widespread ethical failures, from cronyism to cover-ups of incompetence” comes as no surprise.Such are the hallmarks of our current government, which routinely uses scare tactics about national security as a smokescreen to deflect attention from a host of failures, deceptions and abuses in every corner of domestic and foreign policy.The only surprise in the inspector general’s report is the qualifier “short of a crime.”Wake up, America! The Interior Department is just the tip of the iceberg.'"
"'06-09-18,'0','“Bloggers have the potential to change business travel,” said Clancy Ratliff, an assistant professor of English at East Carolina University, in Greenville, N.C., who wrote her dissertation on blogging. “Maybe they haven’t reached a critical mass yet, the way bloggers have in other places. But their influence may be growing.”Take Northwest Airlines’ decision to charge an extra $15 for certain sought-after economy class seats — a fee that also applied to its elite-level travelers. Bloggers like Mark Ashley, who writes Upgrade: Travel Better (upgradetravel.blogspot.com), pounced on the airline, saying that “the ‘premium’ seats Northwest is selling aren’t particularly special,” and that the airline was effectively telling its best customers to “drop dead.”Northwest responded to critics like Mr. Ashley by dropping the fee for most of its frequent fliers, although it would not specifically credit bloggers for the move. And while Mr. Ashley said that he did not believe his blog entries persuaded Northwest to reverse its policies, he added that business-travel blogs like his played a collective role in shaping the airline’s rules. “I think that more companies are taking bloggers seriously,” he said.Some are taking them as seriously as the work of journalists. For example, Marriott International began an ambitious program to reach bloggers this spring. Its efforts included asking bloggers to speak to its corporate communications team, inviting them on press trips and offering them news in advance of print media.“A lot of business travelers are getting their information from blogs,” said John Wolf, a Marriott spokesman. “We wanted to have a better understanding of blogs.”To do that, Marriott assigned an employee to monitor the blogosphere and generate daily reports on what bloggers were writing about the company. It also began pitching bloggers on Marriott-themed postings, recently offering bloggers an exclusive about a plan to put airline check-in stations in its lobbies. “The news got out there within minutes,” Mr. Wolf said.One blogger on the receiving end of Marriott’s pitch was Gary Leff, the chief financial officer of a university research center in Washington. He publishes View From the Wing (http://view.flyertalk.com).“The fact that companies are pitching me, as a blogger, is an acknowledgment that blogs are influencing people,” he said. But until recently, the only evidence that Mr. Leff had any weight to throw around was that some of the special mileage offers he linked to were modified or removed after he posted them on his blog. Marriott’s initiative appears to reflect a change in the balance of power.Robert Safuto, an energy market consultant from Weehawken, N.J., writes a blog, Red Room Chronicles (redroomchronicles.com), which focuses on Marriott, says the message the hotel chain is sending to bloggers is clear: “They’re saying, ‘We’re paying attention to you.’ ”But business-travel bloggers are still a long way from wielding the power of political bloggers. Edward Hasbrouck, who writes The Practical Nomad blog (hasbrouck.org/blog), says that policy changes that result from blog posts are rare. “I recently posted a horror story about the Transportation Security Administration,” he said. “The agency basically blew me off.”One reason bloggers have relatively little influence is that there are relatively few who specialize in corporate travel, said J. D. Lasica of Ourmedia.org. Frequent travelers usually do not have the time to maintain a blog and, until now, didn’t consider it worth the effort. “But I think business travel blogging will take off in the next few years,” he said.Another reason to expect growth, said Shel Holtz, a communications consultant and business-travel blogger who publishes the blog RoadWeary (roadweary.holtz.com), is that business travelers aren’t blogging to their potential. “They need to become savvy about the means by which they can spread the word,” he said. That means adding keywords to postings so that the content can be found online, and providing links to like-minded bloggers.Then again, business-travel blogs may just need a big break. Alex Halavais, a blogging expert and assistant professor at Quinnipiac University, calls it the need for a “Lott-Rathergate” moment — a reference to blogs’ reporting on Senator Trent Lott’s praise of segregationists and the challenging of documents cited by Dan Rather on President Bush’s National Guard service.“So far it hasn’t happened in business travel,” he said. “At least not yet.”'"
"'06-09-18,'0','CARD SCANNERS Exchanging business cards at meetings and professional conferences is a big part of doing business. But the cards are useless unless their information is kept in a meaningful way. For years, CardScan by Corex, an optical reader that sees business cards, digitizes them and imports their information into digital address books, has practically become a standard. Its newest model, CardScan Executive, is smaller, sleeker, faster and synchronizes with smartphones, Microsoft’s Outlook, ACT!, Lotus Notes and GoldMine. It costs $260.ScanR, in Palo Alto, Calif., is taking a different approach. Beginning Sept. 25, its technology will let users photograph a business card with a camera phone (two megapixels or higher are required) and send it to its Web site (scanr.com). The card and information is e-mailed back to the user with PDF attachments, at no charge.COMPUTER Far and above the workhorse of any traveling executive or small-business operator is a reliable, up-to-date notebook computer. And while there are a number of portable technologies that digitally pack whole desktops of information into thumb-size devices that can hang from key chains and charm bracelets, they are hardly a substitute for a lightweight notebook computer.The Fujitsu LifeBook Q2010 fits the bill as well as the briefcase. The most striking aspect about the company’s latest ultraportable computer is not its matte magnesium skin (with titanium hinges) that whispers business, but its startlingly thin profile and feathery weight. When closed, this notebook is only .78-inch thick and weighs 2.2 pounds.Beneath its stylish shell is more than enough power to get the most enterprising tasks done quickly. While the LifeBook Q2010 comes in two models — entry ($2,000) and high end ($3,100) — both use a 1.2 gigahertz Intel Core Solo U1400 processor. The high-end Q2010 has 1 gigabyte of midrange 533 megahertz RAM and an 80-gigabyte hard drive, while the entry model has half the RAM and a 30 gigabyte hard drive.Both models are Wi-Fi (A, B and G) enabled and have a 12.1-inch screen. The high-end model also has Bluetooth. Shortcomings, however, include a slightly smaller than standard-size keyboard, about 94 percent of full size, and onboard battery life of about two hours. The high-end model has a six-cell battery that provides more than seven hours of battery life. The CD/DVD drive and burner, with additional ports, is available in an optional docking station that costs $300 when bought with the notebook.PORTABLE STORAGE While notebook computers routinely have 30- to 40-gigabyte hard drives, conducting business away from the office sometimes requires even more. My Book Premium Edition by Western Digital provides 500 gigabytes of storage in a handsome black box that resembles a rather thick paperback book. And My Book, which costs $320, is not simply more space for documents, audio files, photos or video. The unit, which connects to computers by way of U.S.B. or FireWire ports, includes software for easily backing up sensitive and important data. But at 2.9 pounds, My Book can feel like a haul. For much lighter jobs, Western Digital offers a Passport Pocket Drive, which is a six-gigabyte external hard drive that is smaller than a tin of mints. It plugs into computers with a concealed U.S.B. connector. Like its bigger brother, it is PC and Mac compatible. It costs $100.MOBILE PHONE In the age of seamless communications, a no-nonsense, multipurpose cellphone is as much a part of the business universe as a business suit. But the old bear claw of a phone is giving way to smaller, lighter and speedier ones.One of the most impressive is the Moto Q Smartphone by Motorola. Motorola has made the Q as sleek as it is smart. Its silvery plastic body is .45 inches thick, and its overall rectangular shape fits easily in the palm. Much of its face is equally devoted to its chocolate-droplike keypad and 2.4-inch high-resolution color screen.The Q uses the Microsoft Windows Mobile 5.0 operating system, giving it a PC-like look and feel, as PC users browse through familiar icons on its screen. The $200 (with two-year contract) phone is exclusive to Verizon Wireless and uses its broadband EV-DO network. The Q has Bluetooth 1.2 wireless technology integrated into the handset that makes it compatible with headsets and hands-free systems. Its network limits it to North America and it does not work with Macintosh computers.'"
"'06-09-18,'0','Travelers should also prepare for more thorough but varied security screenings. “There will continue to be differences in approaches,” said William A. Green III, managing partner at TD International, a Washington security firm. “For example, in the U.S. we use wands to frisk people, while in Europe they tend to do it with their hands. Wands can’t detect liquid explosives so we may move back toward the type of standard frisking you see in Europe.”Most airports are acting aggressively to increase security procedures after the terror scare at Heathrow Airport this summer. Stanley Norbert, a spokesman for the Singapore Police, said: “While we have received no current specific threat to our airport and civil aviation, we have noted the heightened security concerns in the U.K. and U.S., and have stepped up the level of checks on all passengers, check-in and carry-on luggage.”All bags that are checked or carried on are X-rayed, and all passengers are screened with metal detectors, Mr. Norbert said. “Body searches are also carried out where necessary,” he said.When in doubt, check your bags through to avoid the hassle of items being taken from your carry-on bags. Make sure to check airline Web sites as well. “I advise all business travelers to go online just prior to their trip and check the site tsa.gov,” said Ken Capps, a spokesman at the Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport. “Always look up the latest security items.”When traveling overseas, one of the most noticeable differences is that travelers’ carry-on luggage is subject to more scrutiny, and there is more detailed questioning of passengers, Mr. Capps said.With the restrictions on carry-on bags and weight limits on checked bags, consider using a shipping company to send luggage to your destination. “Shipping your bags costs extra money, but it can save on the headaches of losing bags or having to lug a heavy carry-on through busy airports to make connections,” said Owen N. Wild, the director of marketing for Amadeus North America, which processes travel bookings.Another tip is to leave toiletries like hair gel and shaving cream at a hotel if you stay there often, Mr. Wild said.Business travelers with connections should also consider the transfer times required at airports. For example, Munich’s Terminal 2 (opened in 2003) is one of Europe’s most modern, with baggage security checks integrated into the baggage handling and check-in system. “Our minimum connecting or transfer time for Terminal 2 is 30 minutes,” Ms. Gingerich, the airport spokeswoman, said. “That’s perhaps the fastest of any airport in Europe.”Of course, building in time for security means that most travelers will have extra time on their hands before or between flights, and most airports (including Munich) are working to take advantage of that time by increasing their wireless Internet access as well as providing a broader range of stores and services. For example, Munich Airport has a microbrewery, Ms. Gingerich said. “If you do have to wait,” she said, “then drinking fresh-brewed Bavarian beer is one of the nicer ways to kill time.”'"
"'06-09-18,'0','WHEN Anne Van Lynden, a financial services executive who is based near Amsterdam, recently flew to Nice for a business meeting, she did not even check the schedules for KLM or Air France. Instead, she surveyed discount airlines that she knew could do the trip for less and picked Transavia, a Dutch line that got her to Nice for $39 plus tax. On other trips around Europe, she has also used EasyJet and Ryanair, also low-cost carriers.“They are generally cheaper than the full-price airlines, and I have never had a problem,” she said.Numbed by the rising cost of air tickets, American travelers like Ms. Van Lynden are increasingly aware of the vast web of European routes served by no-frills airlines.But not all those airlines are included in United States Web sites like Expedia, Travelocity and Orbitz. That means travelers trying to save money must be more creative when they make plans. EasyJet tickets, for example, are only available on the EasyJet site.It is not just booking the tickets that takes extra care. Travelers also have to pay attention to which airports these carriers serve. EasyJet’s flight from Nice to Berlin, for example, leaves from that city’s sole airport, but the two-hour flight does not go to Tegel, the Berlin airport from which most flights to the United States depart. Instead, it arrives in Schönefeld, which is about 15 minutes farther from the center of Berlin than Tegel, the city’s main airport. So anyone hoping to make a connection to a plane bound for the United States had better allow an hour or so for the $60 cab ride from Tegel to Schönefeld.'"

"'06-09-19,'0','Shares of Yahoo fell more than 11 percent today after the company disclosed that it had sold less advertising in the last few weeks than it expected, largely because of a slowdown in automobile and financial advertising.Speaking to a conference held in New York by Goldman Sachs, Terry S. Semel, Yahoo’s chief executive, said that while advertising continued to grow from these industries, “they’re not growing as quickly as we might have hoped at this point in time.”Yahoo said that it would still meet its financial targets for the third quarter, but that its profit and revenue will be toward the bottom of the range it had estimated. In July, the company said it expected third-quarter revenue — excluding payments to companies that display its ads — of $1.115 billion to $1.225 billion, and operating cash flow of $445 million to $505 million. The bottom of that range represents a 20 percent growth in revenue and a 16 percent growth on operating cash flow.That would represent a further slowing of Yahoo’s growth. In the second quarter its revenue grew by 28 percent. And that result was lower than analysts expected, causing the company’s shares to slide. Over the summer, Yahoo’s stock had regained all of that loss until today’s disclosure.Yahoo’s shares dropped $3.25, or 11.2 percent, to close at $25.75 in Nasdaq trading.Investors worried that Yahoo’s problems would affect other Internet companies fell as well. Shares of Google, the largest seller of online advertising, fell $10.88, or 2.6 percent, to $403.81. Shares in Aquantive, a large interactive advertising firm, fell $1.23, or 5 percent, to $23.37.Still, Wall Street analysts said it appeared that Yahoo’s problems were not widespread in the industry.'"
"'06-09-19,'0','Joining the growing number of universities that are improving financial aid for low- and middle-income students, Columbia announced today that it will replace loans with grants for undergraduates from families that earn less than $50,000 a year, beginning with the academic year 2007-08. The change will apply to all of its undergraduates, not just entering freshmen.Other Ivy League universities that have replaced loans with grants for low-income students in recent years include Harvard, Princeton and Yale.Columbia tends to enroll a higher percentage of low-income students than many of its competitors. In the freshmen class that entered last year, 14 percent were from families with incomes less than $45,000. Lee C. Bollinger, Columbia’s president, said in a statement, “While full tuition and fees only cover about half the real cost of providing this kind of excellent academic experience, we understand that the price remains dauntingly high to most families.”Columbia officials said that even though the campus already has the most socio-economically diverse student body in the Ivy League, the move to replace loans with grants for low-income students will enhance that diversity further.Columbia said students at Columbia College and the Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Science are receiving more than $55 million in need-based institutional grants in the current academic year. The new initiative will add approximately $3.5 million annually.Columbia officials said that as part of a $4 billion fund-raising campaign, they are seeking to raise $425 million to increase the university’s endowment for financial aid.'"
"'06-09-19,'0','Aiming to expand its position outside the cellular phone market, Motorola said today that it would pay $3.9 billion to acquire Symbol Technologies, a leading maker of scanners and other wireless technology used by manufacturers, retailers and wholesalers.With growth in the retail cellphone market starting to show signs of slowing, handset makers including Motorola are looking for ways to sell more of their wireless technology to corporate customers and governments.Motorola hopes to tap Symbol’s customer list, which includes Wal-Mart, FedEx and Pepsi, to sell scanning devices and mobile computers but also wireless networks, walkie-talkies and mobile phones.“It’s a customer base to die for,” said Greg Brown, president of Motorola’s Networks and Enterprise business. “The story today is not a cellular handset story. It’s around expanding the product portfolio beyond cellular handsets.”Motorola will pay Symbol shareholders $15 a share, 18 percent more than the company’s closing price of $12.71 last Friday, before speculation about a possible merger arose. This afternoon, shares of Symbol were trading up 4 cents to $14.71.If the deal closes by early next year, as the companies expect, Motorola will become one of the largest sellers of handheld scanners and devices that connect to networks wirelessly. In 2005, Symbol, which has its headquarters in Holtsville, N.Y., had sales of $1.8 billion, a 1.9 percent increase from the year before. The company earned $32.2 million, a 61 percent decline from 2004.'"
"'06-09-19,'0','The Q train announcement was, actually, decipherable. That’s not to say it was easy to comprehend.“This train is being delayed. There is a dog on the tracks.”That got the attention of the folks in the front car of the subway train. Cell phones popped open. Calls were made to work. Doubts were expressed as to whether this excuse would be accepted.“Hi, I’m at Parkside Avenue. I’m going to be a while. There’s a dog in front of the train.”“I don’t know what kind of dog it is. But it’s been running in front of the train, and it does not look tired.”It was nearly 8:30, the height of the morning commute, the train at a halt along the outdoor tracks in Ditmas Park, Brooklyn. The dog, which one passenger said had been seen on the Newkirk Avenue platform before it took up the next stage of its adventure, had led the Q train in a weird sort of herding exercise for several stops, striding unfazed in front of the train as it inched along cautiously behind the dog. The dog — with a visible collar and estimated by one passenger straining to look out the front car at no more than 2 years old — hardly looked up on its trek. It stuck inside the two rails, stayed clear of the electrified third one, and appeared, for quite a while, well, headed to a breakfast meeting in Manhattan.'"
"'06-09-19,'0','But Mr. Zetsche said Chrysler was examining its structural costs from its factories to its purchasing operations. He said the company would act on those costs if necessary, but he was not specific.“We have to clearly dig deeper into the top of Chrysler to make sure we further can accelerate the process of increased competitiveness,” Mr. Zetsche said.This afternoon, Chrysler’s chief executive, Thomas M. LaSorda, signaled that the automaker would embark on its second restructuring in six years, vowing to “turn over all the rocks” at Chrysler in order to determine the right cost structure for the auto company.Mr. LaSorda, speaking on a conference call with analysts and journalists, said it was premature to discuss plant closings and that Chrysler needed to keep open “the majority” of its plants. But he said the company was facing severely higher costs for raw materials and parts, up as much as 60 percent this year in some cases. He said Chrysler needed to act as soon as possible.In the presentation to analysts, Chrysler forecast that its share of the American car market would be 10.6 percent during the third quarter, down from its original plan to hold 11.2 percent. That puts it in fourth place, behind General Motors, the Ford Motor Company and Toyota, and just slightly ahead of Honda.But in July, Honda outsold Chrysler, bumping it down to fifth place in the American market. Honda recently announced plans to build a new factory in Indiana, raising the likelihood that it could overtake Chrysler permanently at some point.Chrysler depends more heavily on sales of minivans, sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks than any of its Detroit competitors.But sales of S.U.V.’s and pickups have declined this year in the wake of gasoline prices that reached $3 a gallon this summer. Consumers have shifted away from larger vehicles to cars and crossover vehicles.As a result, Chrysler has been dogged all year by big inventories of unsold Jeeps and pickups, some of which are parked on lots across the Detroit area and in Toledo, Ohio, home to much of its Jeep production.Nonetheless, the company had doggedly insisted that it had no plans for deeper cuts in production like those at G.M. and Ford, and that its business would pick up in the second half of 2006.Indeed, Chrysler plans to introduce a number of new vehicles, including more S.U.V.s, crossover vehicles and the Sebring sedan during the rest of the year, a reason why its fourth-quarter production cuts were more modest than those in the third quarter.But DaimlerChrysler stunned analysts last week when it said Chrysler would lose $1.5 billion during the third quarter, more than double its previous forecast that it would lose $600 million during the quarter.That disclosure, coupled with Chrysler’s announcement today, drew criticism from analysts, who asked Mr. Zetsche why the company had stayed so long with its forecast that it would break even, only to suddenly acknowledge that it expected a significant loss.“There is no way around saying we were optimistic,” Mr. Zetsche said. “We saw things developing not in the way we planned for them.”Rather than change the company’s forecast, Mr. Zetsche said, managers insisted that “next month, we will make it” until the time came to “face the music.”“Obviously, our communication was miserable in this regard,” he said.He declined to blame either American or German managers for the company’s problems, saying that the responsibility lay with management in general. “You can blame anybody of us — that is fair, absolutely,” Mr. Zetsche said.Mr. Zetsche laid some blame, in fact, on the U.A.W. for resisting a health care deal. Last year, U.A.W. members at G.M. and Ford, who had previously received fully paid health care benefits, agreed to pay for part of their medical coverage.Earlier this month, however, the U.A.W.’s president, Ron Gettelfinger, said there would not be a similar deal at Chrysler because a union analysis showed that the company was not in as dire financial shape as G.M. and Ford.Mr. Zetsche said he was “extremely dissatisfied” at the union’s stand. “It is a very strange position that we should have to lose $10 billion before we can have the same as at G.M. and Ford,” he said, referring to G.M.’s $10.6 billion loss last year.The U.A.W. had no immediate comment today.'"

"'06-09-19,'0','Anonymous e-mail messages sent to section members had raised the issue of race and its effect on the election, and had suggested that Mr. Caldwell was unqualified for the job. Mr. Caldwell had countered these and other charges and had said the e-mail messages were “attempting to create a racial divide.”The eastern Long Island branch of the N.A.A.C.P. in Southampton, N.Y., had said that the controversy recalled a history of racial exclusion in organized tennis.The principal challenger, Gerard E. Cuva, who is white, is a longtime Eastern Section official and tennis director of a fitness center in Latham, N.Y., near Albany. He said the lawsuit had nothing to do with race, but was about “lack of transparency and proper procedures” in the nonprofit Eastern Section, which is one of 17 regional arms of the national tennis association and is based in Harrison, N.Y.In the lawsuit, filed in March, the challengers charged that the winning slate had improperly influenced the voting by exclusionary tactics and asked for a recount. They also asked for the Eastern Section’s incumbents to be dismissed, and for the losing slate to be installed; the judge denied both of those requests.“It’s a good day for tennis,” said Mr. Caldwell yesterday after the decision in Westchester County. “We had this cloud hanging over our head for a long time, but we are very gratified that the judge said we won the election fair and square.”But Guy T. Parisi, lawyer for the insurgent candidates, said, “We are going to proceed with the recount,” adding that his clients would decide whether to appeal the ruling “after the recount.”About the recount, Mitchell D. Haddad, the Eastern Section’s lawyer, said, “I am still analyzing that part of the decision with respect to the inspection of the ballots.”Lucius Ware, President of the Eastern Long Island Branch of the N.A.A.C.P., said he would have no comment on the ruling until he read the decision.The Eastern Section was founded in 1921 to oversee tournaments, run development programs and promote the sport of tennis in New York City, parts of upstate New York, Long Island, northern New Jersey and Connecticut.In the lawsuit Mr. Cuva’s slate asserted that tennis clubs that had applied for membership in the Eastern Section late last year had had their applications improperly questioned and delayed, and had been denied ballots. Mr. Cuva contended that the clubs’ members were sympathetic to the insurgent slate, and that their votes would have insured the election of the challengers.Yesterday Judge Lippman said, however, that there were “no illegalities and/or irregularities occurring during the election,” and that therefore there was no need for a new one, and he accepted the existing ballots. Judge Lippman added, though, that a representative of the challengers could inspect those ballots “in order to engage in a recount” within the next 30 days.'"
"'06-09-19,'0','She declined to comment on the specific allegations leveled by the truckers on April 9, 2004, the day of the attack, which took place just as the main insurgency was breaking out in Iraq.That day, as deadly as it was, has been lost in the memory of most Americans as the tally of deaths rises in Iraq. But it gained some notice because one truck driver in the convoy, Thomas Hamill, who was captured by insurgents and later escaped, wrote “Escape in Iraq: The Thomas Hamill Story,” a popular book recounting his experience.In contrast to Mr. Hamill, who characterized the attack as a surprise, the drivers who testified Monday, Edward Sanchez and Sean Larvenz, said there had been ample warning that an attack was under way at a dangerous intersection near the Baghdad airport.The truckers were civilians recruited by KBR to drive in convoys supplying American troops as part of the company’s enormous logistics contract with the Army.Under the contract, the company has been paid more than $15 billion to perform jobs like delivering food and fuel to troops around the world since 2001. The Army recently said it planned to restructure the contract.Just after 9 a.m. on April 9, Mr. Larvenz said, he was leading trucks from a base south of Baghdad toward the intersection when they were attacked by small-caliber weapons, mortars and rocket-propelled grenades.As the convoy’s civilian leader, Mr. Larvenz ordered that the trucks turn around and retreat, he told the committee, which is led by Senator Byron L. Dorgan, Democrat of North Dakota.Mr. Larvenz said he warned KBR officials over his communication system that the area was under attack. “I specifically stated that no convoy should be dispatched to that area, because of the hostilities,” he said. “I believed that if convoys went through that area, we would lose employees that day.”But Mr. Sanchez said that later that day his own convoy, carrying fuel, was dispatched to the area anyway, apparently because fuel stocks were low at the airport. Mr. Sanchez said that just five Humvees guarded a convoy that stretched over miles.By midday, Mr. Sanchez’s convoy was being fired on from both sides and he had taken a bullet in the back and shrapnel in the neck. He heard one man shouting: “I’m hit! I’m hit!” and another screaming, “I’m burning!” on his radio.Somehow he made his way to a Humvee, where a wounded soldier handed him an M-16 rifle. Although Mr. Sanchez had never fired one before, he found himself shooting at insurgents in a gun battle that lasted more than an hour.In an interview, Mr. Dorgan said he did not know how credible the truckers’ allegations were, but called them “a useful thing to explore.”A lawyer for the truckers, T. Scott Allen, presented documents that he said showed that the company later offered to nominate the truckers for a civilian medal if they signed paperwork releasing KBR from any legal liability.'"
"'06-09-19,'0','The scale of Amaranth’s losses — and how quickly they appear to have mounted — was the talk of Wall Street yesterday, as was speculation on how much the bet was leveraged, or made on borrowed money. Still, there were no signs of ripples on the financial markets as a result.Amaranth’s woes are largely the result of a decline in natural gas prices that began in December, well before the spring months of March or April, when they typically fall off. Amaranth’s biggest stake was a combination bet on the spread between natural gas futures prices for March 2007 and those for April 2007. Amaranth had often bet that the spread on that so-called shoulder month — when natural gas inventories stop being drawn down and begin to rise — would increase.But instead the spread collapsed. In the last six weeks, for example, the spread between the two futures contracts ranged from $2.50 at the end of July to around 75 cents yesterday.Traders briefed on Amaranth’s problems, including one person who examined the fund’s books yesterday, said that the losses might be considerably larger than the firm estimated. Over the weekend, according to one person briefed on the situation, Goldman Sachs examined the fund’s positions.Amaranth is not the first hedge fund to experience problems in energy markets. MotherRock Energy Fund, a $400 million portfolio, shut down last month after losing money on its bets that natural gas prices would fall. Summer heat sent prices soaring and the fund lost 24.6 percent in June and 25.5 percent in July, according to one investor.The natural gas market is exceptionally volatile, making it an ideal playground for hedge funds that thrive on wide price movements in securities. Natural gas prices are subject to more severe swings than oil, in part because gas cannot be stored easily.Arthur Gelber, the founder of Gelber & Associates, an energy advisory and consulting firm based in Houston, said that as a result, the natural gas market was about five times more volatile than the stock market.The greatest demand for natural gas occurs during very hot or very cold weather, Mr. Gelber said. During mild periods, like early autumn, an oversupply of natural gas can cause a significant decline in price. Hedge funds have added to this natural volatility, he said.Amaranth was founded six years ago by Nicholas M. Maounis, a former portfolio manager who had specialized in debt securities at Paloma Partners, another large hedge fund. Amaranth employs a so-called multistrategy approach to investing that allows nimble portfolio managers to seize opportunities in whatever markets seem to be most promising at the time.Now that Amaranth has owned up to huge losses in a single sector, “multistrategy’’ seems to have been a misnomer at the fund.In his letter to investors, Mr. Maounis, 43, wrote: “In an effort to preserve investor capital, we have taken a number of steps, including aggressively reducing our natural gas exposure.”Amaranth has additional offices in Houston, London, Singapore and Toronto and employs 115 traders, portfolio managers and analysts, according to its Web site. The firm deploys capital “in a highly disciplined, risk-controlled manner,” it noted.Its energy portfolio has been overseen by Brian Hunter, a trader who joined the fund from Deutsche Bank in 2004 and conducts trades from his hometown of Calgary, Alberta. Mr. Hunter made enough money at Amaranth in 2005, an estimated $75 million to $100 million, to place him among the 30 most highly paid traders in Trader Monthly magazine.Rocaton Investment Advisers, a consulting firm in Norwalk, Conn., whose clients have $235 billion in assets, recommended Amaranth to its customers. Yesterday, Robin Pellish, Rocaton’s chief executive, declined to comment on her firm’s relationship with the fund or to identify clients that it had advised to invest in it.“We’re well aware of the situation with Amaranth and we are monitoring developments,” Ms. Pellish said.Citing Amaranth’s woes, Stewart R. Massey, founding partner of Massey, Quick & Company, an investment advisory firm in Morristown, N.J., said, “I think it will cause investors to go back and take another hard look at the multistrategy funds they are invested in and do a deeper round of due diligence.” Mr. Massey said he did not have any exposure to Amaranth.The problems at Aramanth will help fuel a debate over whether more oversight is needed over hedge funds, which have become increasingly powerful forces in the markets. There are nearly 9,000 hedge funds, managing more than $1.2 trillion in assets. In 1990, hedge funds managed just $38.9 billion, according to Hedge Fund Research.Last week, in a speech in Hong Kong, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, Timothy F. Geithner, said greater attention needed to be paid to the margin requirements and risk controls in dealings with hedge funds.The growth in hedge funds, Mr. Geithner noted, will eventually “force us to consider how to adapt the design and scope of the supervisory framework to achieve the protection against systemic risk that is so important to economic growth and stability.’’In 2004, Amaranth protested a new rule proposed by the Securities and Exchange Commission that would have required certain hedge funds to register with federal regulators and undergo greater scrutiny.“Contrary to media stereotypes of hedge fund managers, Amaranth does not ‘operate in the shadows’ outside of regulatory scrutiny,” its general counsel wrote. “We do not understand why the commission is proceeding so urgently with this rulemaking when the public policy problem to be addressed remains poorly defined and the proposed regulatory response is so burdensome.”The rule, which was issued in late 2004, was struck down in June by the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. Last month, the S.E.C. declined to appeal the ruling.'"
"'06-09-19,'0','Patrick T. Harker, dean of the Wharton School of Business at the University of Pennsylvania, said: “Some of the behavior that institutions engage in is quite unbelievable. There are perverse behaviors that get generated where people do things to drive the rankings.”Some colleges and universities have already taken action. Dickinson College in Carlisle, Pa., said last month that its senior executives would no longer participate in an annual survey sent out by U.S. News, which asks university officials to assess other colleges.At Amherst College, officials increased to 20 percent from 15 percent the number of working-class and low-income students in the freshman class that enrolled weeks ago.The University of Delaware said in May that it would eliminate early admission. Princeton, in announcing its decision yesterday, said it agreed with Harvard that early admissions forced low-income students to commit to the university before they could compare financial aid offers from various universities.“It’s the right decision for universities in terms of equity,” Dr. Tilghman said. “It’s the right decision for the high school students, for their parents and for their guidance counselors, who have found the two-tier system to be fraught with complexity, and that has encouraged a gaming of the system that I don’t think is good for any of us.”Princeton’s decision will affect the class entering in 2008. In addition, each year officials from a loose association of 40 small, less well-known liberal arts colleges tour the country together, marketing their colleges as alternatives to high-pressure, high-prestige institutions. The event is known as the Colleges That Change Lives tour, after a book with that title by Loren Pope published in 1996 and revised this year.“I’m not a believer in selectivity,” said Mr. Pope, a former private college counselor. “I think it’s phony.”“Now everybody is obsessed with the idea of getting into a name-brand school,” he said. “The universities cannot do nearly as good a job as the colleges I like.”The presidents of the 11 colleges represented at the New York meeting are discussing the creation of a statement of principles; the possibility of agreeing to reduce their use of early admission and merit aid, which is based on grades and test scores, not financial need; and whether they can commit to ensuring that at least 20 percent of entering freshmen are from working-class or poor households.“Do we really need to be part of this arms race in merit aid?” said Colin Diver, the president of Reed College in Portland, Ore. “Do we need to participate in this scramble to increase the number of students to whom we say no?”“I talk to lots of presidents who would love to disarm,” Mr. Diver said, “but they’re afraid to do it unilaterally.”They are also considering creating a new set of statistics to measure their educational standing. The proposed standards would be available to the public, but the individual measurements would not be combined to produce an overall score, as in the ranking guides.“There’s the data, make of it what you will,” said Douglas C. Bennett, president of Earlham College in Richmond, Ind., and another participant in the New York session, describing the ethos of the proposal.“I dislike intensely and have been pretty sharply critical of efforts to rank institutions on a single scale,” Dr. Bennett said.Brian Kelly, the executive editor of U.S. News, said the magazine’s rankings appeared to satisfy a deep hunger from students and parents for unbiased, accurate information about colleges. “I see this as a pure exercise in consumer journalism,” Mr. Kelly said. “There is a tremendous demand for this. Fortunately, we have been able to create a model that’s sustained itself.”“This is data that these guys collected 20 years ago and didn’t make public,” he added.It is far from clear whether the college presidents can act in concert without being accused of collusive behavior, in violation of federal antitrust laws. Two dozen elite universities signed a consent decree in 1991, in which they promised no longer to exchange information on the amount of financial aid being offered to specific students. The Justice Department had been investigating the sharing of such information as a possible antitrust violation.Anthony W. Marx, the president of Amherst College, said he thought the group should initiate a discussion with the Justice Department about what forms of collective action might be permissible.“Competition is important and strengthens us and can spread our net,” Mr. Marx said. “But if it’s designed to drive us in a way that’s self-serving and not in society’s interest, then that’s a problem.”The catalyst for the New York meeting was Lloyd Thacker, a former college admissions officer and high school guidance counselor who argues that the aggressive strategies of corporate competition, including marketing, branding and image making, have compromised education.“As educators, we would not design a system that looks like this,” Mr. Thacker said. “Colleges are businesses, yes they are, but they are businesses of a certain kind. They are public trusts.”“We’ve sharpened our business acumen by confusing what is good for business with what is good for education,” he said.Many of the presidents said one of their goals would be to instill in high school seniors a sense that which college they attended did not determine the course of the rest of their lives. “It’s not God’s judgment on your soul,” Dr. Weisbuch of Drew University said.Not all of the presidents agree on what needs fixing in college admissions. Many of the most prestigious colleges do not offer merit aid, and some of the less selective institutions are still determined to increase their number of applicants each year, to find more good students and achieve a broader mix in their freshman classes. But many of them believe it is time to take some risks. “If we can’t behave well,” said Thomas H. Parker, dean of admissions and financial aid at Amherst, “then who can?”'"
"'06-09-19,'0','“Lonelygirl has changed the game,” Mr. Sernovitz said. “We all know that disclosure is important and honesty is first. The question is, How do you still have creative freedom and how do you do fun mystery-based entertainment and make that compatible with open transparency?” One teaser campaign is currently blanketing New York and Los Angeles with purple-and-white signs plastered on subway cars and hanging from cavernous ceilings in train stations. “The woman in red is flirting with you,” reads one. “The person next to you could be your next boss,” reads another.The only clue to the signs’ provenance is a Web address, u-r-connected.com. The site introduces the concept of six degrees of separation and six people identified only by their first names. But the sponsor of the campaign, the ABC network, is not identified on the teaser ads or on the Web site. (The ads are promoting a new ABC show, “Six Degrees,” which will have its debut on Thursday.)The high quality of the ads and the Web site are clear giveaways that the teasers are a well-financed professional ad campaign.But Michael Benson, the senior vice president for marketing at ABC Entertainment, acknowledged that people who see the ads and the Web site may have no idea that it is a campaign for a television show. Still, ABC hopes people will figure it out “sooner rather than later,” he said.“It’s about getting people intrigued with something that isn’t just advertising and selling something,” Mr. Benson said. “For a tease to work, it’s got to really get the audience to ask questions.”Another current teaser campaign has signs urging people to “Seek the guru.” Visitors to seektheguru.com are greeted by a wrinkled man in a red cloak with his hands lifted upward — and information on digital cable and phone packages for Comcast, the company behind the campaign.Other marketers have created MySpace pages to advertise television shows, as Fox did with its show “Prison Break.” But Fox made it clear that the page was not a homemade effort by displaying the name of Toyota, a sponsor.•Not everyone is so careful. Last year, McDonald’s created a fake blog that chronicled the discovery of a French fry that apparently resembled Abraham Lincoln, but consumers were not pleased by the revelation that it was a hoax.“In the unspoken compact between us and advertisers, there is a lot we will take,” said Bob Garfield, the critic for the trade publication Advertising Age and a co-host of the WNYC radio program “On the Media.” “We will be screamed at; we will be offended; we will be irritated. But we won’t be made into chumps. So there is always a risk of backlash when the reveal reveals not only who the advertiser is, but that they’ve been lying to us.”Despite all of that, advertisers may try to duplicate the success of Lonelygirl in future ad campaigns.“I think Lonelygirl will egg people on to try to recreate the Lonelygirl phenomenon,” Mr. Garfield said. “What advertiser doesn’t love a phenomenon?”'"
"'06-09-19,'0','Former Vice President Al Gore called yesterday for a popular movement in the United States to seek an “immediate freeze” in heat-trapping smokestack and tailpipe gases linked by most scientists to global warming.Speaking at the New York University law school, Mr. Gore said that rising temperatures posed an enormous threat and that only a movement akin to the nuclear freeze campaign for arms control a generation ago, which he said he opposed at the time, would push elected officials out of longstanding deadlock on the issue.“Merely engaging in high-minded debates about theoretical future reductions while continuing to steadily increase emissions represents a self-delusional and reckless approach,” Mr. Gore said. “In some ways, that approach is worse than doing nothing at all, because it lulls the gullible into thinking that something is actually being done, when in fact it is not.”President Bush has opposed requiring cuts in heat-trapping gases like carbon dioxide, saying a better payoff will come from a long-term effort to find or improve technologies that provide energy without emissions. The White House last night defended that approach.“This administration is not just talking about climate change,” said Kristen A. Hellmer, a White House spokeswoman. “There are more than 60 programs in place aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions that do not hurt the economy or move jobs overseas.”'"

"'06-09-19,'0','The Virgin Group, the cluster of companies founded by Sir Richard Branson, is introducing its particular brand of corporate philanthropy to the United States today.Called Virgin Unite, it is an independent charity that combines financing and volunteers from the company with financing and volunteers from the public in social outreach work and philanthropic undertakings.“I wouldn’t say we do it in a better way than other companies, just a different way,” Mr. Branson in a telephone interview from Spain.Mr. Branson donates the $4 million to $5 million he receives annually for speaking engagements to Virgin Unite; the Virgin Group covers the charity’s costs and donates products, services and employees’ skills. That, in turn, furthers Virgin Unite’s aims of supporting business models that lead to social and environmental changes, help entrepreneurs, and connect people to grass-roots organizations around the world that can use their money and skills.In South Africa, for instance, it is building a hospital that will sell basic health services to generate income to support itself but will provide free care for H.I.V., AIDS and tuberculosis.It is raising money to support a charity that uses motorcycles to get health care workers into remote areas and connect patients there to health care centers.'"

"'06-09-19,'0','NEW DELHI, Sept. 18 — The United Nations high commissioner for human rights called Monday for international monitors for Sri Lanka, where the bodies of 11 Muslim men were found hacked to death in the country’s east. Government and ethnic rebels traded blame for the massacre.“There is an urgent need for the international community to monitor the unfolding human rights situation, as these are not merely cease-fire violations, but grave breaches of international human rights and humanitarian law,” the commissioner, Louise Arbour, said at the opening session of the Human Rights Council in Geneva.Sri Lanka has a team of unarmed monitors from Nordic countries, whose job is to investigate violations of the 2002 cease-fire between the government and the rebel Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam. But the Sri Lanka Monitoring Mission, as it is called, has no mandate to look into human rights violations.In the latest phase of its ethnic conflict, now more than 20 years old, Sri Lanka has witnessed a re-emergence of some of its most frightening ghosts: disappearances, abductions and killings by unidentified gunmen. Nearly 2,000 people, a majority of them civilians, have been killed since the beginning of the year, according to the Nordic monitoring team.On Monday, the New York-based Human Rights Watch called on the United Nations Human Rights Council to dispatch “a mission of inquiry into recent massacres and other atrocities.” The group also urged the Sri Lankan government to accept the deployment of a United Nations human rights monitoring mission to areas of conflict.The killing of 17 aid workers in eastern Sri Lanka last month drew attention to the dangers facing aid agencies in the country. Ms. Arbour said that “restrictions on humanitarian access have been imposed by both sides,” making things worse for civilians trapped by fighting.'"
"'06-09-19,'0','Higher vitamin D intake has been associated with a significantly reduced risk of pancreatic cancer, according to a study released last week.Researchers combined data from two prospective studies that included 46,771 men ages 40 to 75 and 75,427 women ages 38 to 65. They identified 365 cases of pancreatic cancer over 16 years.Before their cancer was detected, subjects filled out dietary questionnaires, including information on vitamin supplements, and researchers calculated vitamin D intake. After statistically adjusting for age, smoking, level of physical activity, intake of calcium and retinol and other factors, the association between vitamin D intake and reduced risk of pancreatic cancer was still significant.Compared with people who consumed less than 150 units of vitamin D a day, those who consumed more than 600 units reduced their risk by 41 percent. The recommended intake for vitamin D for most people is 400 units a day.The study appears in the September issue of Cancer Epidemiology Biomarkers and Prevention.“This is the first word on this, not the final one,” said the lead author, Halcyon Skinner, an assistant professor of population health at the University of Wisconsin. “It’s a promising lead for a disease that has had very few promising leads.”The researchers acknowledged that they did not have detailed information about sun exposure, which also increases production of vitamin D, and that they could not exclude the possibility that vitamin D accompanies some other factor that would explain the effect.'"
"'06-09-19,'0','His concept of style, as he revealed in the standards “Cherokee” and “Solar,” had something to do with Keith Jarrett (as did the sound of so many other pianists in the contest), with his long-phrased, almost intemperate melodic improvising; it had to do with Mr. Hancock, too, and his sense of order and harmonic vocabulary. But Mr. Hamasyan’s particular kind of nonstop rhythmic reshuffling seemed his own.Those who lost were piles of promise. Victor Gould, an 18-year-old with a lovely, mysterious sense of time, drifted around “You and the Night and the Music,” leaving phrases half-turned and drawing out the house rhythm section, the bassist Rodney Whitaker and the drummer Carl Allen, to help him finish phrases. Aaron Parks, 22, who has been heard for four years in Mr. Blanchard’s band, used strong arrangement ideas and leaned hard on solo-piano performance to show the judges what he could do.And Gerald Clayton from California, also 22 and the son of the bassist John Clayton, came to destroy: his playing had huge, authoritative presence, an Oscar Peterson-like style, highly controlled touch and dynamics and rhapsodic, episodic soloing. (The audience broke into applause during his solo.)Had he won, it would have cast a different light on the whole enterprise. Any musician can use the $20,000 prize money (half of it earmarked for some kind of academic study), but Mr. Clayton seemed fully formed. Mr. Hamasyan was, excitingly, not.At what point will jazz just crumble under the weight of the glib encomiums paid to it? During Sunday night’s gala concert at the Kennedy Center, former Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright talked about how “the power of jazz enhances our cultural diplomacy,” and another former secretary of state, Colin L. Powell, theorized that the qualities that made effective international relations were “the same as those that create a good jazz band.”On Thursday night, at a half-hour White House performance presented by the institute, with the president and the first lady as hosts — which will be seen in February on PBS — Laura Bush gave a speech about jazz as “an American cultural treasure.” No art should have to live up to such clichés.Sunday’s concert included a short, tenebrous duet between Mr. Hancock and Wayne Shorter, as well as a number by Mr. Blanchard’s students from the Monk Institute graduate program, playing adventurously in up-to-the-minute mainstream jazz idioms.But the institute saves prime spots for showboaters who aren’t necessarily jazz performers. Anita Baker, at Thursday night’s event, sang “My Funny Valentine” before the president, and on Sunday Stevie Wonder was awarded the institute’s Maria Fisher Founder’s Award for public service. Flanked by Ms. Albright and Mr. Powell — in the kind of surreal tableau this event provides annually — Mr. Wonder dedicated the award to his mother. “I don’t think she was a Republican,” he added, impulsively. “I’m just trying to keep it real.”Then he performed a drawn-out version of the standard “Midnight Sun,” playing harmonica and singing. The rest of the band was Mr. Hancock on piano, Ron Carter on bass, Terri Lyne Carrington on drums and Mr. Blanchard on trumpet. (Not bad.) But it became overly eccentric, and Mr. Wonder tried some awkward scat singing; despite the booming power of his voice, the performance fell apart.The program for the finals competition and gala concert recycled old news clips implying that record-company bidding wars follow the announcement of the winner. This is not true: the bigger labels are barely signing new jazz artists these days, and the excellent last two winners, the singer Gretchen Parlato and the guitarist Lage Lund, have yet to cut much of a profile.But whatever happens to Mr. Hamasyan, the contest brought him around people like the judges and the contest’s rhythm section, and brought them around him. That’s good enough.'"
"'06-09-19,'0','But a humor of complacency stands in for a language of subversion, and the extent to which you will find the shows funny seems dependent on how seriously you ever considered buying tickets to “Menopause: The Musical.” (Ms. Gaffney on the challenges of fashion: “If you’ve ever listened to this show, you know pants don’t fit me.”)Among adult women who do listen to radio, the percentage spending some time with talk shows has increased, however slightly, in the last eight years, according to the Arbitron ratings service. But GreenStone, as Ms. Steinem explained in a CNN interview last week, is predicated on the notion that women have abandoned radio, and the talk format specifically, because it is “too hostile and argumentative and crazy” and because women are “not nearly as hostile and argumentative.” Certainly the participants on, say, Urbanbaby.com, an online community for young mothers, would dispute that assessment, tackling as they do the issues of pediatricians or foreign policy with the ferocity of the Achaeans at Troy.Though it could not have been Ms. Steinem’s intention to hand the Rush Limbaughs of the world an early holiday gift, GreenStone too easily obliges the idea that debate is just a synonym for bad manners, and in doing so suggests that the only corrective to invidious discussion is no discussion at all — or, rather, lots of little discussions about hosiery and slumber parties.Despite Ms. Steinem’s inadvertent generosity, right-wing critics like Mr. Limbaugh have still sought to disparage GreenStone, even though on ideological grounds there is virtually nothing at which they could plausibly take offense. As Ms. Fonda herself said about the new project last week, radio can serve as a great companion to women while they are “cooking and sewing.”At one point during “The Radio Ritas” last week, I found myself wondering if I were actually listening to Phyllis Schlafly radio. Ms. Spencer, talking about a study indicating that there were possibly negative effects to having children too young, remarked that maybe it was a good idea to wait after all.Ms. Langan responded emphatically: “Let me tell you, it isn’t. Listen to Aunt Maureen, it isn’t. Get married at 30, have fun in your 20’s and have kids between 32 and 35. Don’t wait until your late 30’s or early 40’s, because you’re going to have somebody else’s egg, you’re going to have to get an Asian baby, which is fine,” she said before pausing. “I’m just saying there are different options.” It was at that moment that I recalled that Mrs. Schlafly had a daughter at 40.GreenStone is not a renunciation of Ms. Steinem’s beliefs, as some will surely suggest, but an apt expression of the convalescent feminism she has advocated for nearly two decades: the idea that a better world can be achieved by feeling better. In her view epistemology is no substitute for emotion.Ms. Steinem always disdained intellectualism, saying of academic feminists, in a 1995 interview with Mother Jones, that “nobody cares about them” and that their work was “gobbledygook.” In her own writing she has never produced anything to match the rhetorical rigor of Betty Friedan’s “Feminine Mystique,” offering instead books like the best-selling “Revolution From Within” and occasional pieces that imagine how the world would have been different if Freud had been a woman or if men experienced their own time of the month.At 72, Ms. Steinem remains a passionate activist. So while it might seem petty to begrudge her an interest in levity, she must surely see the prevalence of it all around her, and the triumph in particular of the women’s-magazine voice she favors, from morning television to Olympics coverage.Or perhaps she doesn’t. A guest herself on one of GreenStone’s shows last week, Ms. Steinem said she didn’t understand people who bemoaned the Oprah-fication of the news. To that, she said, her response was, “If only.”'"
"'06-09-19,'0','And Virginia R. Burkett, coordinator of global-change science for the United States Geological Survey and another participant at the April meeting, called it “the only practical solution.”The diversion proposal was recommended by a panel of dozens of scientists and engineers from all over the world invited to Louisiana to view the state’s marshy coast and to envision its future, said Denise J. Reed, a coastal geologist at the University of New Orleans who organized the meeting.“The thing is to stop wasting 120 million tons of sediment” the river carries into the Gulf of Mexico on an average year, Dr. Reed said. Because the bird-foot delta has grown so far into the gulf, she said, the river’s mouth is at the edge of the continental shelf. As a result, the sediment it carries ends up in deep water, where it is lost forever.A diversion would send the river’s richly muddy water into marshes or shallow-water areas where, Dr. Reed said, “the natural processes of waves, coastal currents and even storms can rework that sediment and bring it up and bring it into the coast.”“It’s a lot,” she said, enough to cover 60 square miles half an inch deep every year, an amount that would slow or even reverse land loss in the state’s marshes, which have shrunk by about a quarter, more than 1,500 square miles, since the 1930’s. Such a program would not turn things around immediately, “but every year new land would be built,” said Joseph T. Kelley, a professor of marine geology at the University of Maine, who took part in the April meeting.As the bird-foot delta broke up, Dr. Reed said, it would provide needed sediment to the frail strings of barrier islands that line some of the Louisiana coast.Another potential benefit, Mr. Hanchey said, would come from the substantial nutrient runoff from inland agriculture in chemicals that contribute to the so-called dead zone of oxygen-poor water near the river’s mouth. Applied to the marsh, the nutrients might encourage desirable plants, he said.Designing such a diversion would be complex and time-consuming, and the experts who met in April did not even attempt it. Even this fall’s meeting is not to plan the project, but to plan how the project should be planned, Mr. Hanchey said. Though Louisiana is rich in experts on river, wetland and coastal science, he said, state officials hoped to recruit scientists and engineers from all over the world to tell them “what we would have to know before we could initiate work on something like this, and what we would have to do to gain that knowledge.”In a way, the bird-foot delta is an artifact of engineering. Without the levees and other structures that keep the river in place, it probably would have taken another path.Like many major rivers, the Mississippi has tributaries, which feed water into it, and distributaries, which carry water away from it as it nears its mouth. Its tributaries include the Missouri and Ohio Rivers; one way or another, every stream, storm drain and parking lot from the Rockies to the Appalachians drains into the Mississippi. But about 250 miles from the gulf, near Lettsworth, La., the river stops taking water in and starts feeding it out, into the gulf through the main stem of bird-foot delta but also in distributaries like the Atchafalaya River, which flows into Atchafalaya Bay to the west.Until people interfered with its flow, the Mississippi’s path to the gulf silted up naturally over time; water flow slowed and the river bed lost its capacity to carry a big flood. When next the big flood came, the river would suddenly turn one of its distributaries into its new main stem.This kind of switching has occurred roughly every 1,500 years, geologists say, and since about 1950 the river has been ready for a change — to the Atchafalaya. The Corps of Engineers prevents that from happening with an enormous installation of locks, dams and power stations near Lettsworth, north of Baton Rouge and about 100 miles northwest of New Orleans.Simply letting the Mississippi shift to the Atchafalaya would do a lot for the sediment-starved marshes west of the Mississippi. But it would leave cities like Baton Rouge and New Orleans — and the petrochemical infrastructure between them — without fresh water or a navigable waterway.The diversion the scientists propose would be much farther downstream, but where exactly is not at all certain. One possible location is near Davant, about 45 miles southeast of New Orleans. Another is near Empire, further down the river, where the levees could be opened. In either case the river flow into wet and marshy areas to the west. Another way would have to be found — or constructed — for ships to reach the shipping lane, possibly something engineers call a slack-water channel.As Dr. Clairain explained, “You divert the river, and then you create an avenue in which you are not allowing the river or the sediment to pass,” a channel or lock in which water does not move. “The ship comes up to whatever control you have” — a gate or the like — “and the ship passes through and then the control is reinstituted.”He said he was not aware of similar installations on this scale elsewhere but said, “We have a lot of great people in the state and around the nation who are contemplating these kinds of solutions.”Almost certainly, he and others say, such an approach would require vast new construction. Dr. Clairain said it was unlikely planners would consider using the Mississippi River Gulf Outlet as a shipping channel. Known as Mr. Go, this outlet, just southeast of New Orleans, was blamed as a path for some of the floodwaters that inundated the city in Katrina. Chief among its drawbacks as a shipping channel would be the difficulty of keeping it dredged for big ships.Other issues include the fate of those who live south of the proposed diversion, compensation for land lost to the project and ownership of any land created by it.Mr. Hanchey said relatively few people would have to be relocated.“The closest community is Venice, at the end of the levee system, about 10 miles north of Head of Passes,” where the river splays into the gulf, he said, but its population even pre-Katrina was tiny. South of that is Pilottown, but that, he said, is little more than a place for river pilots to stay while they wait for ships.“There might also be some oyster-lease issues, but those would be minor,” he said.Another question has to do with land rights. Oliver Houck, a professor of environmental law at Tulane University, said fishing access and oil and gas rights are the crucial land issues in Louisiana. “Under traditional land regimes,” Professor Houck said newly created riverside or marsh land belongs to the abutting landowner. “The wild card here is, what if you gain it through a huge federal-state project?”But Mr. Hanchey and Mr. Houck say those issues can also be dealt with relatively easily. Navigation is a bigger problem.People involved in the proposal recognize that the lower Mississippi is “a working landscape” that must continue to function, said James T. B. Tripp, a lawyer for Environmental Defense and a member of the Louisiana Governor’s Commission for Coastal Restoration.“One of the major obstacles to doing any of this pre-Katrina was the navigation industry,” he said. “As a result of Katrina, everyone’s thinking has become more flexible. Katrina brought all that home: how vulnerable this economic infrastructure has become. So there is a greater readiness today to think more boldly about how we can manage the river in a way that will help restore and build wetlands.”Of course the proposed project will be expensive. But Mr. Tripp said there were already “three or four” available financing sources, including coastal oil and gas revenues and other money already approved for coastal restoration.“Is it practical? Yes,” he said. “Will it be expensive? Yes. But when you look at the alternatives it’s very cost effective,” particularly in an era of rising sea levels.Obviously, no one wants to make irrevocable changes in the flow of the Mississippi River only to find out they cause more problems than they solve. Could that happen? “I think it’s possible,” Mr. Hanchey said.But he added: “Our ability to understand and model river responses to actions like this has improved. The technology of hydrodynamic modeling has improved, and of course we have tremendously increased computational power we did not have before. We can run models today in a matter of hours that took weeks even 20 years ago. All of that has improved.“Still, whether we can model the river precisely I don’t know. It’s going to require a lot of data. It’s going to require a lot of brains. There are probably a limited number of people in the world who have worked on something as large as the Mississippi River.”Dr. Clairain said the idea of constructing a project and then watching unanticipated consequences lead to disaster “is the kind of thing the Corps of Engineers as a whole worries about.” He continued: “We are talking about doing projects that can have huge impacts to large portions of the nation, the economy, the people. If the project does not deliver all the ecosystem benefits you are hoping it will, you can make tweaks and the ecosystem will survive. That’s not true of flood control and economics.”But there is a growing recognition that the cost of not acting will be high as well.Along the Louisiana coast, in the delta plain along the river and the oaky woods along Chenier Plain to the west, much of the land is only a few feet above sea level. If seas rise as expected by two or three feet, or more, in the next century, and if the muddy sediments that form this landscape continue to compact and subside, land loss will only accelerate.Given the proposal’s many unknowns, it is hard to say how soon water might begin to flow from the river into the marshes. If there is a decision to go ahead, designing the project might take three or four years, Mr. Hanchey said. “And then of course to build something like this — depending on what this thing ended up looking like, it would take another 5 to 10 years,” he said.Meanwhile, Dr. Reed said, participants in the April meeting are going to produce “a scholarly report” outlining their views in more detail.“We want to get the citations and the context and the substance behind the arguments,” she said. Dr. Reed said she was “invigorated” by the support the idea had received. “My job is to try to carry it through,” she said, “and make sure people don’t forget about it.”'"

"'06-09-20,'1','Indeed, the effects have been fairly limited, confined mostly to the natural gas market. Amaranth’s portfolio, valued at $9.25 billion as recently as a few weeks ago, was apparently halved by a wrong-way wager that natural gas prices would rise, a bet that had produced enormous gains for the fund in recent years. Amaranth traders had reckoned that the difference, or spread, between the prices of gas futures in the months of March and April in coming years would increase. But rising gas inventories caused prices to decline, putting Amaranth on the wrong side of a brutal and accelerating market trend.Officials at the New York Mercantile Exchange, where natural gas futures contracts trade, were matching up Amaranth’s trades with holdings of other market participants, neutralizing their positions. The exchange would say only that Amaranth’s account and the firm that cleared its trades were in good standing.“The market seems to have recovered a little bit from the fall in price we had over the weekend,” said Kent Bayazitoglu, head quantitative analyst at Gelber & Associates, referring to natural gas prices. “It’s leveling out a little bit at $5, and the volume has fallen. It’s slowing down and accepting the prices.”Last week, the market fell to $4.80, the lowest level since September 2004, according to Mr. Bayazitoglu.But reflecting the liquidation of Amaranth’s positions, the spread on some gas futures declined further yesterday. The spread on prices for March and April 2009, a position held by Amaranth, fell 11 percent, to $1.55. In late August that spread had reached $2.85.Amaranth had apparently not anticipated that natural gas storage capacity was rising, said David A. Pursell, a partner at Pickering Energy, a research firm based in Houston. Companies operating storage caverns have expanded capacity recently, and last week, government weather forecasters noted the development of El Niño, a weather pattern in the Pacific Ocean that usually augurs a warmer winter.Officials at Amaranth, based in Greenwich, Conn., declined to comment yesterday on the status of the fund’s holdings.Nicholas M. Maounis, Amaranth’s founder and chief executive, advised investors in an e-mail message on Monday that the fund had lost 35 percent of its assets and that it was liquidating energy holdings.While hedge funds like Amaranth do not typically disclose the identities of their investors, some became apparent yesterday. Amaranth was a favorite of so-called hedge funds of funds, investment pools that buy into various portfolios to try to minimize risk.For example, funds of funds operated by Morgan Stanley, Credit Suisse, Bank of New York, Deutsche Bank and Man Investments all had stakes in Amaranth, as of June 30, the most recent figures available. Those holdings, which ranged from 4 percent to 7 percent of the assets of the funds, are worth far less now than their stated values in June. Officials at those funds declined to comment yesterday.Returns at Amaranth have been high in recent years. From September 2000 to November 30, 2005, a January offering memorandum states, the compound annual return to investors, net of all costs, was 14.72 percent.Officials at Wall Street firms suggest that Amaranth has liquidated a significant amount of its positions in securities that are relatively easy to sell: convertible bonds, leveraged loans and even so-called blank check companies, or special purpose acquisition companies. Liquid investments have sold at a small discount; others, like portfolios of mortgage-backed securities, have commanded a steeper discount, people involved in these negotiations say.Amaranth is still negotiating to sell its natural gas book, where the biggest losses are. Goldman Sachs was interested but pulled out. J. P. Morgan and other hedge funds appear to be looking at the books. Representatives from both banks declined to comment.If Wall Street is not reeling from Amaranth’s woes, the fund’s investors surely are. As is common among hedge funds, Amaranth severely restricts investors’ ability to cash in their holdings. For example, investors can withdraw money only on the anniversary of their investments and then, only with 90 days’ notice. If they try to withdraw at any point outside that time frame, they face a 2.5 percent penalty.Even more draconian, if investors redeem more than 7.5 percent of the fund’s assets, Amaranth can refuse further withdrawals, one investor said. The fund plans to conduct a conference call with investors this week, this investor said.Investors said they were baffled by the apparent lack of risk management at the fund.Officials at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the agency that regulates commodities markets, said they were “aware of what’s going on and taking the proper necessary steps to step up our surveillance.”The commission collects information daily on trades and positions from clearing firms that operate on the Nymex. It also requires traders with large positions to report their holdings and can demand disclosure if it believes a trader is using several different accounts.But depending on where Amaranth conducted its trades, the C.F.T.C. may get limited information on the hedge fund’s trading and holdings in over-the-counter markets. Regulators can require investment firms and traders with large positions in commodities to disclose their positions if they trade on the Nymex and other large futures exchanges. But Congress passed the Commodity Futures Modernization Act in 2000, limiting regulators in collecting information on over-the-counter markets, which have grown markedly in recent years.Several lawmakers have sought to impose more oversight on energy trading but their efforts have not gained much ground.As Amaranth grappled with its losses, résumés from its employees flooded Wall Street. And HedgeBay, a company that creates markets for hedge fund investors trying to buy or sell hedge fund stakes, has started a market for Amaranth positions.The spread in that market — the difference between what a buyer would pay for Amaranth’s holdings and a seller would accept for them — was wide yesterday. Sellers were demanding 35 cents to 40 cents for every $1 invested while buyers offered to pay 10 cents to 20 cents.No trades have been done yet. “People are trying to wait for the dust to settle,” said Jared Herman, the co-founder of HedgeBay. “It’s a fluid situation, and the phones are ringing off the hook.”'"
"'06-09-20,'1','“What does it feel like? Slam it in a door,” Jeter said. “It’s all right, though. No big deal.”The Yankees could clinch their ninth consecutive American League East title Wednesday if they win, or if the Boston Red Sox lose. But they will face Toronto’s Roy Halladay, an elite right-hander, and their lineup will be thin.Besides Giambi and Jeter, Torre said he planned to rest catcher Jorge Posada and center fielder Johnny Damon, who scraped his hand on a tumbling catch at the warning track that ended the fifth inning with the bases loaded.“I think he knows I’m going to feel like a train wreck in the morning,” Damon said. “He’s just telling me, ‘Don’t worry about a thing tomorrow.’ ”Torre also said he did not want Gary Sheffield playing against Halladay, whose fastballs explode on the hands of right-handed hitters.“I just don’t think that’s the right thing to do,” Torre said.The Yankees’ starting pitcher Wednesday will be Sean Henn, whose last start was for Class AAA Columbus in April. Henn’s catcher will be Wil Nieves, who caught him in the minors but has not started in the majors since 2002.Appearances aside, Torre insisted, the Yankees are eager to clinch.“This is the first day we can say, ‘We show up tomorrow, we can make it happen,’ ” Torre said. “That’s what we wait for — that one opportunity, when you wake up in the morning, to do something special.”Giambi has tried to play through his wrist injury, but he has not homered since he started feeling pain in Seattle late last month. Tests have shown only tendinitis, but Giambi said playing in the field had aggravated the wrist.“Being at first base, it gets a lot of work,” Giambi said. “In between innings, I’m catching throws, turning it over. I think that just kind of irritated it, and it flared up.”Giambi said he might get a third cortisone shot for the wrist, but would probably not do so until right before the postseason.As always, October is when Giambi, Rodriguez and the rest of the Yankees will be measured. Giambi was not shy about that point in the Sports Illustrated article.He is quoted on the cover, accompanying a close-up photo of Rodriguez, as saying: “Alex doesn’t know who he is. We’re going to find out who he is in the next couple of months.”Rodriguez, who hit a pivotal homer Monday, is batting .345 in September. The scrutiny of him has subsided, but the article may revive it. Rodriguez says in the article that Mike Mussina and Giambi are not criticized the way he is.“Mussina doesn’t get hammered at all,” Rodriguez is quoted as saying. “He’s making a boatload of money. Giambi’s making ($20.4 million), which is fine and dandy, but it seems those guys get a pass. When people write (bad things) about me, I don’t know if it’s (because) I’m good-looking, I’m biracial, I make the most money, I play on the most popular team.”Mussina said he had not read the article and did not want to comment.On Tuesday, Rodriguez said he understood that he was held to a different standard.“I don’t think there’s a comparable, and it is what it is,” he said. “You have to handle it. Sometimes it’s frustrating, but you deal with it. I think God’s blessed me far too great to start questioning this or that. With the gifts he gave me, expectations are larger and bigger than anyone, and that’s fine with me.”The article details a meeting between Rodriguez and Torre that took place Aug. 24 in Seattle. Giambi prompted the meeting, according to the article, by telling Torre it was “time to stop coddling” Rodriguez.“I basically said, ‘I know you’re hurting inside, because you know how much we’re counting on you, and we need you,’ ” Torre said Tuesday. “It was tough, in a certain way, but it was more in support of him.”According to the article, Giambi had spoken to Torre because he sensed that Rodriguez was not being honest with himself about his slump.In Boston, just before the trip to Seattle, Giambi told Rodriguez that if he were going to draw walks in front of him, it was Rodriguez’s responsibility to drive in runs.Rodriguez protested that he had gotten a few hits recently, and Giambi is quoted as saying, among other things, “Look at how many pitches you missed!”The article said the conversation was a “pep talk,” not an argument. Giambi said he had not read yet it, but he said he would be upset if people believed he was angry with Rodriguez.“I was just trying to find a way to help him out,” Giambi said. “I’ve been there before, struggling, and it seems like the whole world is coming down on you.”Torre said he read most of the article, and he believed it made the point that the Yankees were there for Rodriguez. Yet the cover calls Rodriguez lonely, a notion he tried to deflect on Tuesday.“This is the most support I’ve ever gotten from any team,” Rodriguez said. “I couldn’t be more proud.”Rodriguez said in the article that he never expected Derek Jeter to defend him to fans who boo, explaining that Jeter is quiet by nature.Asked for his reaction to the story after Tuesday’s game, Jeter sounded weary. “That’s over with,” he said. “Let it go.”¶Fans have until Thursday at 5 p.m. to register at Yankee Stadium or online for the opportunity to purchase tickets for the playoffs. ... A report on yankees.com said that starter Carl Pavano was likely to be shut down for the season on Wednesday.'"
"'06-09-20,'1','Bush administration officials have repeatedly cautioned that Mr. Maliki needs more time. “This is a national unity government of many, many moving parts,” said the diplomat, who spoke on condition of anonymity. “He has got to negotiate as he goes.”But diplomats who deal with the Bush administration on Iraq issues, and recently departed officials who stay in contact with their colleagues in the government, say the president’s top advisers have a far more pessimistic view.“The thing you hear the most is that he never makes any decisions,” said a former senior official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss internal deliberations. “And that drives Bush crazy. He doesn’t take well to anyone who talks about getting something accomplished and then refuses to take the first step.”American officials here say they do not intend to let Mr. Maliki fail and are helping him in a variety of ways. For example, to bolster Iraqis’ confidence, American generals are spending money on quick reconstruction projects like trash pickup as the military goes through troubled neighborhoods of Baghdad.The embassy has advisers who work closely with cabinet ministers and has deployed hundreds of Americans to seven provinces to help Iraqi officials build up the government’s political and economic strength. A senior envoy said the biggest effort was simply “Diplomacy 101” — insisting to Iraqi leaders that they resolve their differences.But increasingly, Iraqi and Western officials say the unity government is one in name only, with the political parties representing different sects and ethnicities constantly at odds, undermining Mr. Maliki’s ability to build consensus.While the United States has military might and political influence, it must rely on the Iraqi government to reach out to the country’s political and religious leaders. Trying to placate everyone has kept Mr. Maliki from being able to offer amnesty to Sunni insurgents or forcefully disarm Shiite militias, officials say.The main Shiite bloc itself is deeply divided, depriving the prime minister of crucial support. So he relies on Moktada al-Sadr, the Shiite cleric who commands the powerful militia called the Mahdi Army, for political backing. The militia has been blamed by many Sunni Arabs for sectarian killings.To ensure that the minority Sunni Arabs remain involved in the government, Mr. Maliki finds himself compromising on issues like cabinet appointments with conservative Sunni parties that have occasional contact with nationalist guerrillas.“I think he has said good things, but in practice there has been no change,” said Mahmoud Othman, an independent Kurdish legislator. “The security situation is deteriorating and violence is getting worse. He has done nothing against militias. At the same time, the reconciliation dialogue is not moving forward. It doesn’t look good, the prospects for the government.“I thought he’d be stronger, but he looks weak,” Mr. Othman said. “He feels frustrated because nobody’s cooperating with him.”The same sentiments are heard in the streets of the capital.“There’s no security, no job opportunities, no services, nothing at all,” said Muhammad Jabar Abdul Ridha, 18, a construction worker walking through downtown Baghdad on Tuesday afternoon. “This government hasn’t done anything better than the previous one.”While some officials in Washington say Mr. Bush and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice still insist in staff meetings that Mr. Maliki must be given more time and support, there is a growing sense that he is not about to change his operating style. A former senior official said the big test would be whether Mr. Maliki could confront Mr. Sadr. “If you don’t do that, I don’t know how he can succeed,” the official said.The prime minister’s aides declined repeated requests for an interview with Mr. Maliki, who emerged as a compromise choice for prime minister during a power struggle last spring in which the White House and Mr. Sadr backed different candidates.Supporters of Mr. Maliki say it is too soon to judge his tenure. Any unity government requires compromises, they argue. “He’s been in office only a short time, and the size and number of problems from the former regime and former cabinets are huge,” said Sheik Khalid al-Attiya, a deputy speaker of Parliament.Mr. Maliki has made efforts to quell the Sunni-led insurgency, including reaching out to some Sunni Arab guerrilla groups, Iraqi officials say. That may help widen a rift in the insurgency between Iraqi nationalists and foreign fighters. Sheiks in rebellious Anbar Province announced last Sunday that 25 of 31 tribes in the province were ready to fight against Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia.Iraqi and American officials who have dealt with Mr. Maliki say he is much more blunt and expressive in meetings than his predecessor as prime minister, Ibrahim al-Jaafari, who leads Mr. Maliki’s political party. Mr. Maliki is not given to diplomatic formalities and makes his views known, they say. At the same time, he likes to listen to a range of opinion — often at the expense of making decisions, the officials say.Mr. Maliki acts as if he is backed into a corner these days, said a moderate legislator who recently spent two and a half hours in a private meeting with him.“You were one of the hawks,” the legislator recalled telling Mr. Maliki. “Now you’re one of the doves.”“No, I’m still one of the hawks,” the legislator quoted the prime minister as saying. “I just need time.”Mr. Maliki’s security plan for Baghdad, now the American military’s main effort of the war, intentionally avoids direct confrontation with Mr. Sadr’s militia, despite Iraqi Army generals’ apparent willingness to attack the militia and despite growing violence by rogue militia elements. The plan, begun last month after an initial failed effort in June, involves military sweeps of violent neighborhoods, generally after fighters have already fled.The murder rate has dropped in some neighborhoods. But the plan’s effectiveness was called into question last week, when more than 165 bodies were found across Baghdad in four days. Shiite militiamen are the main suspects. The Baghdad morgue has said more than 1,500 civilians were killed in August, a 17 percent drop from July but higher than nearly all other months of the war.Brig. Gen. Dana J. H. Pittard, assigned to help train Iraqi police and army units, said Iraqi Army commanders, who usually have fewer sectarian loyalties than the police, were ready to take on the militias but had not gotten approval from the government.“There’s this obvious question that the army guys are asking, about ‘When are we going to get rid of the militias?’ ” General Pittard said in an interview while meeting with American military advisers at a base in Taji. “If you talk to the leaders of the Iraqi Army, they’ll say, ‘We need to be given an order to disarm the militias.’ ”Last month, after American and Iraqi soldiers attacked a militia safe house in the Sadr City neighborhood of Baghdad, the prime minister denounced the action and promised compensation to families of Iraqis killed or wounded in the assault.Lt. Gen. Peter W. Chiarelli, the second-ranking commander in Iraq, said American and Iraqi generals were waiting for Mr. Maliki to find a political solution to the militias.“How long will that process take?” he said. “I don’t know.”Mr. Maliki has little obvious leverage over Mr. Sadr, who controls at least 30 seats in Parliament and six ministries, making him one of the most powerful figures in the government. Mr. Sadr has no intention of disbanding the Mahdi Army, because it is now part of the government, said Bahaa al-Aaraji, a senior legislator allied with him.“They are just volunteers defending their country,” Mr. Aaraji said.Mr. Maliki is also tiptoeing around other powerful Shiite leaders with militias. Abdul Aziz al-Hakim, the head of the Parliament’s Shiite bloc, has ignited a political firestorm by calling for the legislature to approve a mechanism to create autonomous regions. Many are opposed, and the move threatens to splinter the government. But rather than rein Mr. Hakim in, Mr. Maliki has kept quiet.As a centerpiece of his reconciliation project to end the Sunni insurgency, Mr. Maliki wants to forge an amnesty policy that would draw into politics some militant Sunni Arabs and former officials from Saddam Hussein’s Baath Party, Iraqi politicians say.But the proposal has been attacked by hard-line Shiites like Mr. Hakim, who is opposed to leniency for killers of Iraqis, and American politicians outraged at the idea of amnesty for those who have attacked American troops.That could doom Mr. Maliki’s plan, said Ayad Jamaladin, a moderate Shiite legislator on the government’s reconciliation committee.“Innocent people don’t need amnesty,” he said. “Guilty people need amnesty.”Some conservative Sunni leaders are also resisting Mr. Maliki’s efforts. Politicians in Baghdad and tribal sheiks in restive areas insist that he meet a long list of demands that includes releasing all detainees and setting a timetable for the withdrawal of American troops. Many Sunnis also fear that Mr. Maliki is beholden to Iran, and his trip there last week further stirred concerns.“With whom should we reconcile?” asked Sheik Muhammad Saleh al-Bajari, a spokesman for tribes in Falluja, the Sunni Arab stronghold. “With those who brought the occupier and killed and destroyed the future of this country?”'"
"'06-09-20,'1','Mr. Basciano, 46, a dapper man who is sometimes called Vinny Gorgeous and served briefly as the acting boss of the Bonanno organized-crime family, was convicted of racketeering conspiracy at the trial that ended in May, but the jury deadlocked on murder charges. In July, while at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in Manhattan, he gave the list to an inmate, several of the people said.At the time, the inmate — unbeknownst to Mr. Basciano — was working out a deal with prosecutors, the people said. He gave the list to prosecutors, according to the letter, leading to the investigation.Mr. Basciano “indicated to the inmate, in sum and substance,” that he was seeking to murder the people on the list, read the letter, written by John Buretta, Winston Y. Chan and Thomas J. Seigel, assistant United States attorneys in Brooklyn. The inmate was not named in the letter.Mr. Basciano was quickly moved into solitary confinement. For that reason, federal authorities did not believe that the judge or the others were in grave danger, several of the people said. But they said they were treating the matter seriously nonetheless. It is unclear whether additional security precautions have been taken.The mother of the inmate to whom Mr. Basciano gave the list has some involvement with Santeria, several of the people said, but the details are unclear.Mr. Basciano’s lead lawyer, James Kousouros, would not comment on the investigation, noting that at a hearing on the matter on Aug. 28, a portion of which was closed to the public at Mr. Kousouros’s request, Judge Garaufis ordered both sides not to discuss it. Mr. Kousouros also complained that the letter was made public without notice to the defense.“The defense intends to prove that there was absolutely no nefarious motive behind anything the government has published,” he said, referring to the list.Another of Mr. Basciano’s lawyers, Ephraim Savitt, said it was irresponsible for the government to make the letter public before the investigation had been completed and they could determine whether the accusations were true.The accusation that Mr. Basciano was conspiring to kill a federal judge was stunning not only because of its nature — and his explanation for the list — but also because killing judges has long been taboo among Mafia members in the United States.If the allegations are true, Mr. Basciano’s apparent bad luck in giving the list to a man who was already cooperating with the authorities would not be unprecedented. It was his own family’s boss, Joseph Massino, who the authorities have said told them about what they say was Mr. Basciano’s plot to kill the lead prosecutor, Greg Andres, in his first case.And if Mr. Basciano indeed went outside the mob to find a killer, it would be an acknowledgment of the calamitous impact that a series of prosecutions led by Mr. Andres has had on the Bonanno family in recent years. The cases have led to convictions against about 75 mobsters and mob associates, including Mr. Massino. Judge Garaufis also presided over Mr. Basciano’s earlier trial and is to oversee his upcoming trial on a murder and racketeering indictment that includes charges of plotting to kill Mr. Andres. Mr. Basciano is awaiting sentencing in that case and could face up to 20 years in prison. He could face the death penalty at his next trial if the United States attorney general, Alberto Gonzales, authorizes prosecutors to seek it.The three witnesses on the list are Dominick Cicale, a former Bonanno capo who was very close to Mr. Basciano; Louis Tartaglione, a former capo; and Tommy Lee, a lawyer who was accused of carrying messages for Bonanno figures.'"
"'06-09-20,'1','After a long break, demonstrations against the prime minister had been due to resume this week, bringing with them the danger of violent clashes between his supporters and opponents.Late Tuesday night, General Sondhi was shown on television in an audience with King Bhumibol Adulyadej, a clear indication that the highly revered constitutional monarch endorsed the move.On a military-controlled television station, a general in civilian clothes said a “council of administrative reform” had seized power in the name of the king.Speaking for General Sondhi, who has publicly feuded with the prime minister, Gen. Prapas Sakultanak said that the military did not intend to rule the country and that it would “hand power back to the people.” He gave no timetable.The military has a long history of political involvement, staging 18 coups since Thailand became a constitutional monarchy in 1932. The last one, in 1991, installed a military leader who was pushed from power by a popular uprising the next year.Under heavy rain, tanks and armored personnel carriers took up positions blocking the entrance to the prime minister’s office on Tuesday night. Other tanks arrived at government offices and major intersections. Witnesses reported that roadblocks had been set up on roads leading into the city. The streets were quiet, and even at the prime minister’s office there was little tension. Some bystanders photographed one another standing near the tanks.Kitichai Songkeattisi, 40, a commercial photographer, said: “The last time was much more intense. People were more afraid.”Mr. Thaksin is one of the most popular — and unpopular — prime ministers in recent Thai history. Thais’ different viewpoints demonstrate a sharp social divide that he has played on during the crisis.Mr. Thaksin’s party, Thai Rak Thai, or Thais Love Thais, has won three elections by landslides, in 2001, 2005 and again in April. Because of his broad support among rural voters, he was widely expected to win any new election.But as he has tightened his grip over much of the political scene, opposition to him has swelled among the elite, mostly in Bangkok. Public indignation rose after his family’s tax-free sale of its $1.9 billion stake in a giant telecommunications company to a Singapore company.On television, the military spokesman, General Prapas, accused Mr. Thaksin of corruption and constant interference with the legislature and the courts. He apologized to the public for any inconvenience caused by the coup.In an effort to end the demonstrations and reassert control, Mr. Thaksin called an early election in April, which he won in a landslide. But the opposition boycotted the vote and a court annulled the result, in a severe setback for the prime minister.An election commission loyal to Mr. Thaksin set a new vote for Oct. 15, but its members were removed and jailed by a court for malfeasance. A new commission has said that election would be delayed.The televised announcement on Tuesday was made after reports of large-scale military movements around the capital. The military has been sharply divided between officers loyal to the prime minister — some of them his relatives — and others who oppose him.There has been tension over an impending military shuffle that would determine which faction would dominate.Interviewed in New York by CNN soon after early reports of a coup, Deputy Prime Minister Surakiart Sathirathai said, “We hope that the situation should return to normal soon because the prime minister is constitutionally and legally elected prime minister and this is an elected government, so we have to do everything we can to uphold the principle of democracy.”General Prapas, speaking in Thailand, laid out the rationale for the military’s move.“The government’s performance destroyed harmony in society,” he said. “Everyone tried to win over each other, and the situation continued to worsen. Most people don’t trust the government because there are many signs of corruption.”He said the prime minister had hobbled independent bodies created by the 1997 Constitution to provide checks and balances. A leading demand of the prime minister’s opponents is the writing of a new constitution that would temper executive power.General Prapas said many attempts had been made at compromise but had failed. “That is why we, the Party for the Reform of Governance under the Constitutional Democracy, which consists of the army commanders and national police commander, have to seize power.”He added: “We would like to insist that we have no intention of governing the country. We will return the power of constitutional monarchy back to Thai people as soon as possible to maintain peace and stability.”'"
"'06-09-20,'1','“This is not a Department of Defense type of procurement,” Mr. Esser said in an interview before his company was notified of its selection. “Customs and Border Protection just doesn’t have that kind of a budget.”The program, the Secure Border Initiative, is a central element of the Bush administration’s plan to curtail illegal immigration. The president also wants a temporary-worker program to give legal standing to many illegal immigrants already in this country.The Senate may vote as early as Wednesday on bills to direct the department to build a 700-mile two-layer fence between Mexico and the United States, about a third of the shared border. The House has passed the proposal.Such a fence could require fewer of the high-tech measures that Boeing would provide.Because major gaps on that border would remain and because there are no plans for a large-scale fence along the Canadian border, the alternative methods of monitoring thousands of miles would continue to be necessary.Under the Boeing plan, towers would be built along the border with radar systems to watch for movement, as well as cameras that could zoom in on movements to determine whether the subject was a vehicle, animals or people.Ground sensors to detect movement, sound or simply contact would be installed, particularly where tree coverage makes the radar and cameras less effective, Mr. Esser said.Northrop Grumman had proposed using an unmanned aerial vehicle, a drone known as the Global Hawk, that flies as high as 65,000 feet for up to 34 hours, to help monitor the border. Each vehicle can cost tens of millions of dollars.Lockheed Martin had proposed using, among other tools, a high-altitude balloon known as a tethered aerostat that flies at up to 15,000 feet and, weather permitting, can be left up for a long time.The Boeing proposal includes small, relatively inexpensive unmanned aerial vehicles that can be launched from a pickup truck by an agent in the field and then fly for, perhaps, 90 minutes. These vehicles could help apprehend illegal immigrants, but they would not be routinely used to monitor large stretches of the border.The Boeing team also looked for ways to reduce the cost of sending out Border Patrol agents, by figuring out how long it could allow illegal immigrants, even after they have been detected across the border, to continue walking or driving before it would be necessary to seize them.“We don’t have to pick them up in the desert,” Mr. Esser said. “We can pick them up once they reach the road.”The contract could still turn into a deal worth up to $2 billion for Boeing over the next six years.Winning this contract will help the company sell its services to other countries looking to secure their borders.Among contractors, this was considered one of the three most important contracts offered by the Homeland Security Department. The others involved rebuilding the Coast Guard fleet of ships, helicopters and planes and creating a tracking system for visitors who enter the United States legally.Members of Congress have expressed some skepticism about whether the department will be able to succeed in this border effort because of the failure of previous ones.“Achieving operational control of both the northern and southern border — nearly 7,500 miles — within five years is an enormous, but important, undertaking,” Representative Harold Rogers, Republican of Kentucky, said Tuesday. “Huge technical, geographic and personnel challenges remain.“Nevertheless, my colleagues and I are prepared to give D.H.S. the resources it needs — provided funding is linked to results — to get the job done.”'"
"'06-09-20,'1','WASHINGTON, Sept. 19 — NASA told the space shuttle Atlantis to stay in orbit for at least one extra day on Tuesday while engineers try to determine if a mystery object seen floating nearby is an indication of possible damage to the spacecraft.The Atlantis and its crew of six had been scheduled to land at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida early Wednesday after a successful mission to the International Space Station.But with poor landing weather predicted for Wednesday and concern that the unidentified object might be a critical piece of the Atlantis, N. Wayne Hale Jr., the shuttle program manager, said mission supervisors “decided we should delay de-orbit for a day and spend our time productively making sure we’re comfortable with the status of the orbiter’s heat shield in particular.”The Atlantis’s protective heat shield, which includes tiles on its bottom and hard, composite material on its nose and the leading edges of the wings, has been inspected in detail twice — the day after its Sept. 9 launching and after the shuttle left the space station on Sunday — and declared in good shape for landing.NASA has been particularly cautious about the heat shield since a crack in the Columbia’s protective skin caused it to disintegrate when returning from a mission in February 2003, killing seven astronauts.Mr. Hale said the object was first spotted early Tuesday by a camera in the Atlantis cargo bay. Low-resolution images and a lack of data about it prevent engineers from determining the object’s size, mass or exact shape, he said, making it hard to tell whether the item is critical to the shuttle or a sign of a threat. The pictures indicate a very small black object orbiting near the shuttle, Mr. Hale said.'"
"'06-09-20,'1','A British fund manager, the Henderson Group, is buying John Laing, a developer of doctors’ clinics, hospitals and schools, for $1.67 billion. Henderson will pay 355 pence ($6.67) a share in cash, or a total of £886.9 million for all of Laing’s shares, the companies said. That represents a premium of 29 percent on Laing’s closing share price on Sept. 13, the day before the company said it had been approached by an unidentified bidder. “Combining Laing’s operational skill base with Henderson’s financial capacity should help to ensure Laing’s continued development in the U.K. and underpin its expansion into overseas markets,” Laing’s chairman, William Forrester, said. (AP)German investor confidence slid to its lowest level in more than seven years amid fear that tax increases and rising interest rates could slow growth in the country’s economy, a leading economic institute said. The closely watched index, compiled by the ZEW Center for European Economic Research, dropped in September for the eighth consecutive month, to its lowest level since January 1999. (AP)Canada’s annual inflation rate dropped to 2.1 percent in August as falling gasoline prices offset advances in the housing sector, the federal government said. With the decline from a rate of 2.4 percent in July, the annual inflation rate has fallen for three consecutive months, the first time in two years that has happened, according to Statistics Canada, the government’s statistical arm. (AP)An Ontario court upheld a Canadian regulator’s decision to halt the Sears Holdings Corporation’s buyout offer for its Canadian unit, Sears Canada.

"'06-09-20,'1','The Advertising Council, the nonprofit organization that coordinates pro bono campaigns on behalf of the industry, is going on a road trip for the first time. The Feelin’ Groovy tour is visiting 63 shopping malls in 33 markets, performing skits for children and families under the rubric Ad Council Theater.The skits are based on the council’s familiar public service announcements on topics like preventing wildfires, encouraging literacy, fighting asthma and adopting children from foster care. The council’s partners in the tour include the Radio Disney unit of the Walt Disney Company, the Simon Property Group and 4Kids Entertainment.The tour “gave us a chance to get out and reach a lot of children,” said Michael Long, the state forester for Florida who is one of three representatives from the National Association of State Foresters working with the Advertising Council on wildfire prevention campaigns like the famous Smokey Bear ads.The tour “reaffirms that Smokey is still there in a more personal way,” Mr. Long said. “You can see him, touch him, hug him.” Peggy Iafrate, director for integrated marketing at Radio Disney in Boston, said the initial venture with the Advertising Council “has worked really well,” adding, “Our partnership is just beginning.” Radio Disney charges sponsors about $250,000 each to take part in mall tours; the Advertising Council paid substantially less than that because of its nonprofit nature.A for-profit marketer making its first foray into road trips is Windstream Communications, a telecommunications company formed in July that serves primarily rural markets in 16 states. Windstream is sponsoring what it calls “The Green Truck Tour,” sending a pair of customized 1953 Chevrolet pickups into 34 markets in 16 states to take part in events like the Pelion Peanut Party in Pelion, S.C.; Twins Days in Twinsburg, Ohio; and the World Chicken Festival in London, Ky.“Windstream is a new company with no name-brand awareness whatsoever, so we had to build a brand in a real short time,” said Ric Crane, senior vice president for marketing and sales at Windstream in Little Rock, Ark. The trucks, which are equipped with contemporary technology like satellite radio and DVD players, are meant to personify the Windstream brand identity, Mr. Crane said, which is “classic on the outside and high tech on the inside.”“We’re enjoying it as much as our customers are,” Mr. Crane said of the tour, which began in July and is scheduled to end in November. The trucks come from an advertising campaign for Windstream created by the Concept Farm in New York; the tour is managed by another New York agency, Grand Central Marketing.Among other examples of branded road trips are the Planters Nut Mobile, making a cross-country tour to mark the 100th anniversary of the Planters nuts brand owned by Kraft Foods; the LashExact Mobile Tour, featuring a purple van that visits drugstores and supermarkets to promote Cover Girl LashExact mascara, sold by the Procter & Gamble Company; and the “Mini Takes the States Rally,” for owners of the Mini Cooper cars sold by BMW, which traveled from California to Connecticut.For all the benefits of experiential marketing, experts like Ms. Rice point out that pitfalls also lurk.An event has to be “an honest, authentic expression of a brand campaign,” Ms. Rice said, “and the consumer has to feel there is something of legitimate value there.”'"
"'06-09-20,'1','SANA, Yemen, Sept. 19 — It was supposed to be like other elections in the Arab world: the president portrays himself as a changed man, the respected opposition candidate is discredited and the opposition ends with an embarrassing loss.Yemen’s landmark presidential election, however, is proving to be anything but ordinary.Voters go to the polls here on Wednesday to choose a president and local council representatives in a surprisingly heated contest pitting voters’ desire for change against their fear of instability. It may prove to be one of the most open electoral battles in the region, analysts and election monitors say, as President Ali Abdullah Saleh fends off the biggest electoral challenge of his 28-year rule.His most serious challenger is Faisal bin Shamlan, 72, a former minister and member of Parliament who has a reputation of integrity. Mr. Shamlan, backed by a coalition of the four largest opposition parties, including its Islamists, has promised to fight government corruption and to distribute authority among Yemen’s regions. Government corruption, he insists, has led to growing militancy, Yemen’s scourge.Virtually no one expects Mr. Shamlan to win, but most analysts expect his challenge to embolden the opposition in future elections, if not to prompt real political change.Yemenis are increasingly angered by corruption and a lack of opportunity. But they also see a government with dwindling power in the face of growing Islamist influence, analysts say. Mr. Saleh had pledged that he would not run again, but he reversed himself in June after rallies that he said expressed the people’s will.'"
"'06-09-20,'1','If the deal closes by early next year, as the companies expect, Motorola will become one of the largest sellers of hand-held scanners and devices that connect to networks wirelessly. In 2005, Symbol, which has its headquarters in Holtsville, N.Y., had sales of $1.8 billion, a 1.9 percent increase from 2004. The company earned $32.2 million in profits, 61 percent less than in 2004.The addition of Symbol would more than double Motorola’s business selling hand-held computers, radio frequency identification tags and other equipment used to track products in factories, warehouses and in stores, Mr. Brown said.Motorola, which is based in Schaumburg, Ill., has also been producing more phones for white-collar workers who want to gain access to the Internet and e-mail outside the office. The company’s line of “Q” phones aims to rival Research in Motion, which makes the popular BlackBerry, and Palm, which makes Treo. By combining these phones with Symbol’s handsets, Motorola could make even bigger inroads into the market serving corporate customers, analysts said.“They need Symbol’s brand recognition and technology to leapfrog Nokia,” said Christin Armacost, a telecommunications analyst at Lazard Capital Markets. At the same time, she said, “Motorola is going to bring their carrier relationships to help Symbol.”The companies, though, have some overlapping technology, and they will have to create software that allows their various devices to speak to each other, industry analysts said. They must also consider how or whether to put scanning technology on Motorola phones, which are considerably smaller than Symbol’s hand-held devices.Still, with Symbol, Motorola could become the only company capable of bridging the gap between mobile phones and local area networks in homes, offices and elsewhere. Motorola, for instance, could put readers in cellphones so that shoppers scan items as they put them in their baskets, effectively creating an EZ pass for the supermarket or department store and eliminating check-out lines.“If they tackle that, the Internet goes airborne,” said Eric Austvold, an analyst at AMR Research. “It’s very George Jetson.”'"
"'06-09-20,'1','The Metropolitan Museum of Art opened its concert season more splashily than usual on Monday evening. Instead of using its usual haunts — the Grace Rainey Rogers Auditorium, the Medieval Sculpture Hall and the Temple of Dendur — the museum put a stage and seats in its Great Hall, and presented a short but lively concert of Bach and Vivaldi concertos, with the Orpheus Chamber Orchestra supporting the latest star of the violin world, Janine Jansen.This Dutch violinist, in her late 20’s, has become best known for a chamber-scale recording of Vivaldi’s “Four Seasons” that became a hit on iTunes early this year. The cover shows Ms. Jansen in a gauzy, low-cut dress, reclining in a plush chair and dangling her violin lazily over its armrest. In interviews, she has distanced herself from her marketing, and at the museum she wore a sleeveless pink gown somewhat more demure than Anne-Sophie Mutter’s usual concert attire.Now that she has everyone’s attention, Ms. Jansen is selling what she ought to be selling: fresh, energetic, thoughtful musicmaking. She produces a lovely, supple tone, slightly lighter than it sounds on disc, although in the most hard-driven passages of Vivaldi’s “Summer” Concerto, and the fast movements of Bach’s Concerto in E (BWV 1042) and the Double Concerto in D minor (BWV 1043), her playing was as forceful as you could want.In the two Bach works, Ms. Jansen’s shading of the solo line and dynamic manipulations yielded carefully characterized, persuasive readings, and if her interpretive tinkering sometimes drew her toward a Romantic expressive style, her tempos and restrained vibrato were fully of the Baroque world (or at least modern conceptions of it). In the Bach allegros, she drew on a palette of bright hues that affirmed the music’s muscularity, without making it into Brahms. And in the Larghetto e Spiritoso slow movement of the E major Concerto, she produced a magnificent pianissimo that floated sweetly over the accompaniment.Ms. Jansen took a similar approach to the Double Concerto, for which she was joined by Eriko Sato, one of Orpheus’s violinists. The dialogue between the solo lines was generally balanced, and both Orpheus and the soloists made the most of the hall’s acoustics by sharply accenting punctuating chords in the allegros and letting them resound through the hall.This effect was also put to striking use in Ms. Jansen’s closing work, “Summer” from the “Four Seasons,” as well it might be, given the score’s vivid depiction of a violent thunderstorm, gathering in the first two movements and unleashed in all its fury in the finale. Ms. Jansen didn’t skimp on other painterly details, either: the bird calls and the shepherd’s pining, in the first movement, were depicted gracefully, and in an unusual touch (also heard on her recording), she had the sizzling figuration that ends the first movement fade to a pianissimo and move, without pause, into the Adagio.'"

His new wine shop, his first, at 47-07 Vernon Boulevard in Long Island City, Queens, tips its hat to the nearby tunnel that connects that borough to Manhattan, and to the train tunnels of yore, with an arched stone passageway that runs between the front, retail part of the store, and the glass-walled section for rare wines and the tasting room in back. Mr. Huston’s very personal selection of wines emphasizes small estates, and even among the spirits there are some hard-to-find bottles.

Her new cookbook provides a modern chef’s approach not just to Jewish cooking, but to kosher cooking. And instead of traditional matzo ball soup, chopped liver and tsimmes, the recipes expand the repertory. Parsnip and roasted garlic bisque, duck breast schnitzel with maple mashed sweet potatoes and braised chard, and a very good cocoa and canola oil devil’s-food cake with a pareve egg-based chocolate mousse filling, so it can be served with either meat or dairy, make this book worthwhile.Rounding Up Some Nuts for a Little SnackCowgirl Chocolates of Moscow, Idaho, known for its spicy confections, is now selling nut brittles, one with zip and two without.

Maurice Clarett delivered Ohio State the 2002 national title in double overtime, but on Monday, he stood with his square shoulders hidden beneath a beige jail-issued shirt, with his sure hands at the goal line now bound by handcuffs.He revealed the weary eyes of an older man and a vagrant’s beard of someone long lost as he told the court, “I’d like to apologize for my behavior, and I accept the time that was given to me.”Bush was free, able to wrap his hands around eight catches as a New Orleans Saints rookie on Sunday. Bush ran fast, with jukes and spins, as if chased by bees on Lambeau Field — or was that a Packer in yellow pants?Here are two collegiate wonders with disparate afterlives, but Bush and Clarett still have a connection: both have been purposely disowned by university officials.Maurice? He’s not with us, say the folks at Ohio State.Reggie? Hardly knew him, say the caretakers of U.S.C.Deny and disavow. Clarett was discarded well before he was sent to prison on aggravated robbery charges this week. He was a Buckeye outcast the instant he emerged as a player on the take in 2003. After an internal investigation, Ohio State booted Clarett for receiving extra benefits.The university distanced itself from Clarett and appeased the N.C.A.A. at the same time. The title trophy was safe, all clear.U.S.C. is expecting a similar outcome. Maybe no punishment at all. No proof, no foul. And even if there was evidence, Bush’s New Orleans teammate Joe Horn summed it up this way, “If he did what they said he did, so what?”So what isn’t on first or second; so what is the problem.There are no repercussions. So what if his Heisman Trophy is gone; the memory and the money aren’t. And what about U.S.C.’s fate? Only a few N.C.A.A. penalties rise above symbolic. And those teams that receive harsher punishments — like Miami in the 90’s or Alabama five years ago — show uncanny resilience. Miami emerged from sanctions to reel off 34 straight wins. Alabama finished last season at 10-2.The N.C.A.A.’s only bullet remains in its chest pocket: the death penalty.The only time it was dropped on a program — when Southern Methodist University, a serial miscreant, had its 1987 season cancelled — there were catastrophic consequences. Not only did S.M.U.’s athletics collapse, so did its conference.“There is no penalty in the manual that is off the table if the circumstances and facts warrant it,” said Josephine Potuto, the chairwoman of the N.C.A.A.’s infraction committee.That’s the way it should be: preserve the cudgel. But how can the N.C.A.A. uncover extreme wrongdoing without subpoena power?“To get something like that, you end up having to expose yourself to governmental oversight,” Price said. “And that’s something we would have to think long and hard about.“There are times when we are very frustrated because people won’t talk to us. We have to live with that. And we do the best we can within the system that the N.C.A.A. membership is comfortable with.”The kinder, gentler N.C.A.A. is more comfortable micromanaging family values. Last week, it gave Clemson permission to establish a trust fund to assistant in normal living expenses for the freshman football player Ray Ray McElrathbey, who has temporary custody of his 11-year-old brother.The N.C.A.A.’s authority as an enforcer is increasingly futile. Its position as moral authority is all that remains for the keeper of college spirit.'"

"'06-09-21,'0','It was a guy thing: rampant testosterone; fistfights and epithets; incendiary, harmonically minimal rock as hard, loud and fast as cheap guitars could play it, made by young musicians wanting to blow up the world with noise and attitude.“American Hardcore,” a documentary chronicle of the hardcore punk movement that flourished outside the rock mainstream through the first half of the 1980’s, imagines that this underground culture, which flamed out in 1986, was more than a new generation’s style of hormonal eruption. To many of the musicians who fondly remember the wild old days when the bands and their audiences melted into a delirious mass of flailing, diving bodies, it had to mean something more than just letting off steam. And maybe it did.As some remember it the movement, which sprouted an informal network of local bands around the country, was a spontaneous expression of disgust by an alienated fringe with the ascendance of Ronald Reagan, along with all things preppy. The movie names Southern California as the site of hardcore’s birth, and regards New York as a latecomer to the party.Musically hardcore was a repudiation of almost everything, from disco to the dilution of first-generation punk labeled new wave to, of course, the same high-flying and deeply loathed bands, like the Eagles, Fleetwood Mac and Journey, that the original punks also despised. Hardcore was more than noncommercial; it was anticommercial. No one in the movement made more than spare change, and many lived hand to mouth. Poverty was synonymous with purism.Directed by Paul Rachman, from a screenplay by Steven Blush based on his book “American Hardcore: A Tribal History,” the film, which is filled with grainy archival clips of hardcore performances, is a toned-down cinematic equivalent of the music: fast and loud, but not too loud. The movie scrambles to cover so much territory that there is room only for musical shards and slivers; few complete songs are heard, and no signature anthems stand out. These excerpts are spliced with pungent bits and pieces from dozens of interviews, the whole crisply edited into a rapid-fire history. If 9 out of 10 bands are groups almost no one ever heard of, the movie’s encyclopedic concept is touchingly thorough.As the story advances both chronologically and geographically, it moves from Los Angeles to Boston, then up and down the East Coast, with trips back west and a quick jaunt to Canada. Leading the roster are Bad Brains, referred to in tones of reverence, and Black Flag, whose tattooed hunk of a lead singer, Henry Rollins, became the closest thing to a star minted by hardcore.'"

"'06-09-21,'0','The emergence of a prime minister with no personal experience of World War II is considered a turning point in Japan, where the absence of a consensus on the war still troubles relations with the rest of Asia.Considered politically inexperienced, Mr. Abe, who will be the youngest prime minister in postwar Japan, rose to political stardom by talking tough on North Korea, China and national security. In Japan and in the rest of Asia, Mr. Abe is regarded as even more hawkish and conservative than Mr. Koizumi.To his supporters, Mr. Abe is a politician unburdened by Japan’s past, capable of forging a newly independent and strong path for the nation. To critics, he is a potentially dangerous ideologue ready to jettison the postwar values that have brought stability, peace and wealth to Japan.Hakubun Shimomura, a Liberal Democratic lawmaker and an ally of Mr. Abe’s, said the next prime minister would “look back objectively at the postwar period, removed from its trauma and able to make choices as part of the postwar generation.”“I think the symbolic start of the independent nation of Japan will be Mr. Abe’s revision of the Constitution,” Mr. Shimomura said.But Shusei Tanaka, a professor at Fukuyama University and a former Liberal Democratic lawmaker, worried that Mr. Abe’s greatest influence was from his grandfather, Nobusuke Kishi, a wartime cabinet member imprisoned as a Class A war crimes suspect but never tried, who became prime minister in 1957. Recently, Mr. Abe has avoided commenting on Japan’s wartime past.Only five years ago, few would have predicted that Mr. Abe would become prime minister. He was known mainly as the grandson of Mr. Kishi and the son of Shintaro Abe, a former foreign minister, whom the son long served as secretary.Mr. Abe took over his father’s parliamentary seat in 1993, after Shintaro Abe’s death, and became quite popular among voters, earning a reputation as a strong leader by voicing national anger at North Korea’s admission in 2002 that it had kidnapped several Japanese citizens in the 1970’s and 1980’s. Since then, he has kept his hard line against North Korea, and against China. After North Korea launched missiles in July, he suggested that Japan debate whether it should acquire the military capacity for a pre-emptive strike.One of Mr. Abe’s most pressing problems will be to restore normal relations with China, which has refused to hold high-level talks because of Mr. Koizumi’s annual visits to the Yasukuni Shrine, the Shinto memorial where 14 Class A war criminals are enshrined. The shrine, also a memorial to Japan’s 2.5 million war dead, is considered a symbol of Japanese militarism in the rest of Asia.The visits have worried American politicians that Japan is provoking China, and hurting American interests in the region. Mr. Abe, despite past support of the visits, has said he would pursue a policy of ambiguity, neither confirming nor denying whether he has visited the shrine.On wartime history, Mr. Abe has allied himself with Japan’s right-wing politicians, news media and scholars. Unlike Mr. Koizumi, he has doubted the validity of the postwar Tokyo trials in which Japan’s wartime leaders were condemned.In the past he has indicated that he rejects the mainstream, postwar view that Japan waged a war of aggression and invasion in Asia. But he has not publicly embraced the hard-line position that Japan waged war in Asia to liberate it from Western imperialism. Unlike Mr. Koizumi and other prime ministers, Mr. Abe, though pressed many times, has avoided endorsing a landmark apology issued in 1995 by the Japanese government to Asian countries.Japanese hard-liners regard him as a true believer, while they looked askance at Mr. Koizumi for trying to negotiate with North Korea and for proposing to change the Imperial Household Law so that a woman could ascend the throne. While Mr. Koizumi made decisions on his own, dividing people between enemy and ally, Mr. Abe emphasizes harmony.“People tend to like Mr. Abe’s personality,” Mr. Shimomura said. Lacking Mr. Koizumi’s larger-than-life personality, Mr. Abe has instead cultivated a soft image that has taken the sharp edges off his strong views. Mr. Abe, a teetotaler who is married but has no children, appeared on a talk show to announce that his favorite food was ice cream.“In his appearance and his way of speaking, he’s soft,” Mr. Shimomura said. “But in the inside, he’s rock solid. He sticks to his principles and won’t compromise.”'"
"'06-09-21,'0','The new accusations surfaced just one week after the Interior Department’s inspector general, Earl E. Devaney, told a House subcommittee that “short of crime, anything goes” at the top levels of the Interior Department.In two of the lawsuits, two senior auditors with the Minerals Management Service in Oklahoma City said they were ordered to drop their claim that Shell Oil had fraudulently shortchanged taxpayers out of $18 million.A third auditor, also in Oklahoma City, charged that senior officials in Denver ordered him to drop his demand that two dozen companies pay $1 million in back interest.And in a suit that was filed in 2004, Mr. Maxwell charged that senior officials in Washington ordered him not to press claims that the Kerr-McGee Corporation had cheated the government out of $12 million in royalties.On Wednesday, Interior officials denied that the agency had suppressed any valid claims and implied that the auditors simply wanted a share of any money recovered through their lawsuits.“If these auditors believed there were fraud and or false claims on the part of the companies they were auditing, they should have followed the proper procedures,” the Interior Department said in a written statement. “Instead, they opted to pursue private lawsuits under which, if they prevail, they could receive up to 30 percent of the monies recovered from the companies.”In defying their own agency, the Interior Department’s auditors sued the oil companies under a federal law, called the False Claims Act, that was created to allow individuals to expose fraud against the government. People who successfully recover money for the government in such cases are entitled to a portion. A losing company is required to pay triple the amount of recovered money as well as back interest — potentially more than $120 million in the cases brought by the auditors.Destin Singleton, a spokeswoman for Shell, said the company had not seen the suits and could not comment. John Christiansen, a Kerr-McGee spokesman, said, “We believe the case is without merit and we are defending against it.”In dollar terms, the suspected underpayments amount to a tiny fraction of the $8 billion in royalties that companies paid last year for oil and gas extracted from federal lands.But the lawsuits come at a time when the Interior Department is already under fire from Congress, accused of covering up ethical lapses and managerial incompetence.“These accounts, coming from the front lines, point a big red arrow at the large problem of taxpayers being stiffed,” said Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, who has been investigating the accusations.“If it was one isolated instance, you could say that’s somebody who had a bad experience and was frustrated,” Mr. Wyden said. “But when you have three or four professional, nonpolitical, independent auditors all bringing the same message, that is too important to ignore.”By any measure, the Interior Department under President Bush has placed top priority on increasing oil and gas production in the United States. Under its business-friendly agenda, the department has increased incentives for drilling in risky areas, has speeded approvals for drilling applications and has campaigned to open more coastal areas for oil exploration.Lawyers who have specialized in lawsuits under the False Claims Act said they had never seen a group of government investigators use the law against their own agency.“Most whistle-blowers are insiders at a company who spot something that government auditors have missed,” said James Moorman, president of Taxpayers Against Fraud Education Fund, a nonprofit organization supported by lawyers that specializes in the False Claims Act.“But here you have auditors saying, ‘We did our job, we found the problems and our superiors don’t want to hear about it,’ ’’ Mr. Moorman said. “If it were just one auditor, you could dismiss it. But with four auditors, that’s a pattern of practice.”In their suits, the auditors contend that they had no choice but to go outside the agency because their supervisors ordered them to “cease work” on five separate investigations and drop their claims.Documents recently unsealed in Mr. Maxwell’s case against Kerr-McGee, which is scheduled for trial in November, show that federal officials abandoned his claims at almost the same moment that state auditors in Louisiana reached the same conclusions as Mr. Maxwell.Under federal regulations, companies are supposed to pay the federal government a royalty of 12 percent or 16 percent on oil and gas they extract from federal lands or coastal waters.Mr. Maxwell’s job was eliminated in 2004. He received a settlement from the government and is now living in Hawaii.A much-praised auditor who recovered hundreds of millions of dollars over a 20-year career, Mr. Maxwell concluded in late 2002 that Kerr-McGee had used a clever marketing deal to reduce its apparent sales receipts and royalty payments.Under the marketing deal, Mr. Maxwell contended, Kerr-McGee sold its oil at $1 to $3 a barrel below market prices to a company called Texon. Mr. Maxwell’s auditing team said that Texon was making up for Kerr-McGee’s shortfall by providing marketing and administrative services. In effect, Mr. Maxwell contended, Kerr-McGee was being paid in both cash and services but only paying royalties on the cash portion.Interior officials initially encouraged Mr. Maxwell when he raised the concerns about Kerr-McGee in early 2003. “I am sure we can make the case,” wrote John Price, then head of the agency’s appeals division, in an e-mail message to Mr. Maxwell.But a few days later, lawyers in the Interior Department’s solicitor’s office urged him to drop the case. “Although I did not understand the reasoning, it was made clear to me that the agency did not want the order issued,” Mr. Maxwell wrote in an affidavit for his suit. “The next day, Mr. Price telephoned me and reiterated to me that if I issued the order, the director would be very upset with me.”But Louisiana auditors were investigating the same practices in connection with royalties on state-owned land, and had concluded that Kerr-McGee was lowballing its sales price by $1.50 to $3 a barrel. Louisiana officials demanded more than $1 million in additional state royalties from the company, and eventually settled for $600,000.In two of the lawsuits that were unsealed last week in Oklahoma, senior auditors in Oklahoma City said they had been ordered to drop claims that Shell Oil had underpaid by $18 million.The suits were brought by Joel F. Arnold, a supervisory auditor who oversees a team of offshore auditors based in Oklahoma City, and Randall L. Little, a senior auditor on Mr. Arnold’s team in Oklahoma City.Like Mr. Maxwell, both of the Oklahoma auditors have more than two decades of experience in government and industry and have received numerous government awards for the money they have recovered.In one suit, Mr. Little contends that he found evidence from his audit that Shell had reduced the sales value of oil from six leases by fraudulently inflating transportation costs. One practice, they said, allowed Shell to improperly escape $15 million in royalties. A second practice allowed Shell to save $3.8 million by claiming transportation costs for oil that was being delivered to the government at its own production site in the Gulf.The Justice Department, which reviews such suits and sometimes joins them, declined to participate in these cases. But it did not urge the courts to dismiss the suits, as some senior Interior Department had wanted.None of the Oklahoma auditors would agree to an interview. Elizabeth Sharrock, a lawyer for Mr. Arnold and Mr. Little, said both men had already been removed from their usual jobs and were afraid of being fired.But according to their suits, the auditors presented their findings about Shell last October to their supervisor in Houston, Lonnie Kimball. Mr. Kimball, according to court papers, initially told the auditors to “go straight to Shell” with the complaints.But in January, after meeting with a Shell executive, Mr. Kimball abruptly reversed course and told the auditors to “cease work on all false claims” against Shell.In its statement on Wednesday, the Interior Department acknowledged that the auditors had been told not to send “issue letters” — an official notification that a company appears to have underpaid royalties.But it said that other auditing offices had been investigating the issues and taken certain actions. “In fact,” it said, “our actions to date include: issuing late-payment interest bills; continuing an ongoing audit; and determining that an issue was not supported by the regulations.”Interior officials did not say how much money they had recovered from companies named by the auditors. But the agency’s own statistics indicate that revenue from auditing and enforcement plunged after President Bush took office.From 1989 through 2001, according to a report by the Congressional Budget Office, auditing and other enforcement efforts generated an average of $176 million a year. But from 2002 through 2005, according to numbers that the department provided lawmakers last May, those collections averaged only $46 million.In another clash, frustrated federal auditors have complained that the Interior Department no longer allows them to subpoena documents from oil companies.“Subpoenas are a very powerful tool to get the information you need, but I don’t think they’ve approved a single subpoena in years,” Mr. Maxwell said in an interview. “In the good old days when we were able to issue subpoenas on our own, each of us was able to recover millions of dollars a year.”Agency officials acknowledged that they have not issued any subpoenas in the last three years. “Enforcement of subpoenas by the courts can take years and be very costly,” the agency said in a written response to questions. “We have not found them to be a very effective tool.”'"
"'06-09-21,'0','As recently as Tuesday, it looked as if the chemical industry, with the assistance of Senator George V. Voinovich, Republican of Ohio, was on its way to winning approval for regulations that echoed almost word for word what the industry had been seeking.Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff would have been authorized to establish regulations requiring security measures, but the regulations would have applied only to a sliver of facilities that manufacture, use or store toxic chemicals and that are deemed to have the “highest levels of security risk.” Mr. Chertoff would not have had the power to shut down plants not in compliance.The proposal would also have left decisions about security plans entirely up to these high-risk plants.“Nothing in this section authorizes the secretary directly or indirectly to require any particular security measure,” the proposed language said. That wording had been endorsed by 34 senators, all but one Republicans, in a letter that Mr. Voinovich circulated Monday.But Democrats, and some Republicans, said the proposed regulation was far too friendly to the industry.“This closed-door deal is industry-written and incomplete,” Senator Frank R. Lautenberg, Democrat of New Jersey, said in a statement Wednesday. “Americans shouldn’t be fooled that this will protect them from a terrorist attack on a chemical plant. We need stronger measures that will force the industry to take this issue seriously.”Industry officials acknowledge that they were pleased with the proposal by Mr. Voinovich, and they have been lobbying intensely to get it passed.“It is short, simple and effective,” said Margaret Hunt, a lobbyist for the Edison Electric Institute, which is helping a broad range of companies that would be affected by the regulations monitor the negotiations. “We kind of like it.”Approval of the industry-backed measure is now in question because of objections raised by Senator Susan Collins of Maine, Representative Peter T. King of New York, and Senator Judd Gregg of New Hampshire, all Republicans who hold powerful positions.Ms. Collins and Mr. King are the leaders of the Senate and House committees that oversee the Homeland Security Department’s operations, and Mr. Gregg is chairman of the Senate panel that oversees its budget, and thus controls the bill into which Republicans want to include some form of regulations.Mr. Gregg said in an interview Wednesday that the Republicans organized by Mr. Voinovich must come to an agreement with Mr. King, Ms. Collins and others with oversight authority before any language would go into the budget bill. He said he hoped to have a final agreement on the Department of Homeland Security budget bill in time for it to win final passage by Congress before it goes on recess this month until after the midterm elections.Mr. King and Ms. Collins want the proposed regulation changed so it applies to all chemical plants that are at “high” risk, instead of just the “highest,” spokesmen for the two said. They want the Homeland Security Department to inspect plants to ensure compliance and shut any that do not honor the rules. They also want any regulations inserted into the budget to expire after three years, so Congress will have a chance to pass more comprehensive rules.“I do want a chemical plants bill, but one that is meaningful,” Mr. King said Wednesday evening.Many Democrats, meanwhile, are struggling to add even stronger provisions to the regulations that would allow states like New Jersey, which already has its own plant rules, to have stronger requirements and to allow the Homeland Security Department to mandate that plants consider switching to less toxic chemicals, if the conversion would not be excessively expensive or complicated.“Five years after 9/11, security at our chemical plants is still voluntary and our cities and critical infrastructure are still too vulnerable,” said a letter signed Wednesday by 22 Democrats and one independent, all senators. “Too many legislators have worked too long on comprehensive legislation to see that effort undermined by backroom deals.”As it monitors the negotiations, the chemical industry is seeking most importantly to prevent regulations that would order plants to consider switching the chemicals they use. Industry representatives argue, as they have since the debate began, that Democrats and environmentalists are trying to hijack what had been an antiterrorism matter and use it to advance their own agenda.“They were trying to pursue their agenda to ban certain chemicals under the guise of security,” said Scott Jensen, a spokesman for the American Chemistry Council. “This is not the appropriate place to have that debate.”Environmentalists say that a fence or security camera is not enough to prevent a dangerous chemical release in an urban area — that only replacing the highly toxic chemical will accomplish that goal.Ms. Collins, who has a track record in important negotiations including the reconfiguration of the government intelligence agencies and the restructuring of the Federal Emergency Management Agency now pending before Congress, said in an interview Wednesday evening that she remained hopeful that an agreement would be reached in time to insert regulations in the budget bill.“This vulnerability has been raised time and again by terrorism experts,” she said. “It is a glaring one that invites attack.”'"
"'06-09-21,'0','Wal-Mart, the nation’s largest retailer, will test a program to sell generic prescription drugs to its workers and customers at sharply reduced prices, according to people briefed on the plans.The giant discount chain, which has used its size to knock down the costs of toys, clothing and groceries, will sell generic versions of about 300 widely prescribed drugs for as low as $4 for a standard prescription, these people said, speaking on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to disclose details of the new program.

"'06-09-21,'0','WASHINGTON, Sept. 20 — As the rich and powerful gathered in New York to discuss sweeping approaches to climate change under the aegis of former President Bill Clinton, the Bush administration unveiled its priorities for working with Asian countries on voluntary efforts and for spending $3 billion on technologies that could cut emissions of heat-trapping gases.James L. Connaughton, chairman of the Council on Environmental Quality at the White House, told the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee that the Asia-Pacific partnership between the United States and Australia, China, India, Japan and South Korea would share technology advances.An example of their plans, Mr. Connaughton said, was a $58 million deal by which the Caterpillar company provided a Chinese mining operation with generators that could burn methane gas that would otherwise be vented into the atmosphere. Methane’s warming potential in the atmosphere is more than 20 times that of carbon dioxide.Shortly before Mr. Connaughton testified, Stephen Eule, director of the Climate Change Technology program at the Energy Department, gave the energy subcommittee of the House Committee on Science an overview of the administration’s technology priorities.But the committee chairman, Representative Sherwood Boehlert, Republican of New York, chided Mr. Eule about the long time horizon envisioned for some technologies, saying that the administration’s plan “is silent on the deployment of technologies already out or near the end of the pipeline” of research efforts.“What are we doing about deploying these technologies next year” Mr. Boehlert added, “not 15 years from now?”'"
"'06-09-21,'0','Both J..P. Morgan and Citadel, a Chicago-based $12 billion hedge fund, x have large energy trading desks and can sell parts of the energy assets or hold them, hoping for prices in certain sectors, including natural gas, to recover. Representatives for Amaranth, J..P. Morgan Chase and Citadel all declined to comment.With the energy holdings sold, Amaranth can turn its attention to dealing with its shellshocked investors. More than half of them are funds of hedge funds that saw Amaranth as a blue-chip name, stocked with star traders and an impressive track record. Amaranth’s future will depend, in large part, on how quickly investors decide to redeem their funds.Investor anger is directed not only at the fund’s loss of more than 50 percent of its value in just a week, but the fact that Amaranth — after having a bad month in May, with funds falling 9.5 percent to 10.5 percent in value — apparently reassured investors that it would better manage its risk in the future.Still, the May losses alarmed some investors, even as the fund continued to show returns of more than 29 percent for the year. Nervous investors who called or turned up at Amaranth’s expansive offices in Greenwich, Conn., trying to determine if the traders were taking too much risk, got a simple message: No.“After May there was a lot of concern and they spent a lot of time explaining and demonstrating that if the month had ended three days later, losses would be a lot less,” said one investor who spoke on the condition that he not be identified because he is trying to get his money back. “They explained why it wouldn’t happen again.”Yet investors also knew that the fund’s stellar results were coming from aggressive energy bets. Monthly letters detailed the status of strategies including being long or short on stocks, merger arbitrage and credit products as well as convertible arbitrage and energy.According to a letter sent to investors, 56 percent of the firm’s capital was invested in energy-related bets as of June 30, generating 78 percent of the fund’s 2006 returns. The firm had roughly 6,670 energy trading positions that were leveraged — or increased with borrowed money — about 4.5 times.Amaranth started the year with $7.5 billion. At its peak at the end of the summer, the fund had assets of $9.2 billion. Returns through the end of August were 24 percent, despite a volatile run with its energy positions over the year. Then on Monday, investors received a brief, but disturbing, letter: the fund would be down at least 35 percent for the year, or $2.6 billion, as a result of bad bets in natural gas.Some investors had bristled at the increasing volatility in the fund. Lehman Brothers Alternative Investment Management invested in Amaranth Partners starting in January 2002, according to a letter it sent to some of its fund of fund investors. But by fall of 2005, based on concerns about volatility, it placed redemptions for most of its money not subject to withdrawal penalties. By the beginning of this month, it had reduced its exposure to Amaranth by more than 50 percent.The impact on Lehman Brothers Diversified Arbitrage Fund for the year “is expected to be approximately flat,” the letter said. A Lehman spokesman declined to comment. Investors continue to worry about how much money is left in the fund and how it will be distributed. Amaranth has restrictive gates, allowing it to refuse to honor redemptions if more than 7.5 percent of the fund’s assets are redeemed. This all may be irrelevant because the general partnership or board of a fund has the right to freeze all redemptions if allowing investors access to the funds would put the entity in jeopardy.“It’s quite possible that a general partner or board of directors could decide that adverse events had occurred, such as those that may have occurred at Amaranth, and that a fair and appropriate response would be to suspend redemption rights and effect the orderly liquidation of the portfolio,” said Stephen Culhane, a partner at the law firm of King & Spalding.A conference call with investors is planned for later this week, said one person who had spoken with the fund.According to the letter, Monday was the deadline for Oct. 31 quarterly redemption requests. “We are evaluating all redemption requests received to date and will report back to you when we have completed our analysis,” the letter read.The sale of the energy holdings does take pressure off Amaranth. The energy positions, some of them severely underwater, left Amaranth in a precarious position, having to meet margin calls — loans from banks — extended to help magnify those bets.Amaranth was forced to liquidate positions last week to meet those calls, selling everything from its positions in leveraged loans and convertible bonds to the stocks it held.Negotiations on a sale of the energy trades lasted through Tuesday night, culminating early yesterday. Wall Street firms including Goldman Sachs and Citigroup also looked at the assets.One relationship that might have helped negotiations is that among Amaranth’s 400 employees, its chief operating officer, Charles Winkler, was the former chief operating officer for Citadel, one of the eventual buyers. Mr. Winkler, a lawyer by training, declined to comment.'"
"'06-09-21,'0','But with each passing day, the chances narrow that Dr. von Eschenbach’s nomination will be approved. As it was on Wednesday, the committee had trouble assembling a quorum. Its hearing was delayed, and then it moved to a small reception room in the Capitol that barely fit the more than 50 staff members, reporters and senators who crammed into it.When enough senators finally filtered in, Mr. Enzi read through the bills and nominations before the committee like an auctioneer fearing rain. Only Senator Barbara A. Mikulski, Democrat of Maryland, managed to get in a word edgewise.“As you know, the F.D.A. is located in my state,” Ms. Mikulski said, as the crush of reporters and staff towered above her. “There is a crisis of morale at the F.D.A., and I take him at his word that he will deal appropriately with this.”Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, Democrat of New York, started to speak next. “Mr. Chairman, I — — ” was as far as she got. Mr. Enzi raised his hand.“We’ll keep the record open for the rest of the day to reflect any members’ statements,” he said, and glanced at Mrs. Clinton, who nodded in return. He asked for a vote. It was unanimous.And that was it.Senator David Vitter, Republican of Louisiana, has promised to hold up Dr. von Eschenbach’s nomination until the Bush administration agrees to legalize imports of cheaper drugs from abroad. And Senator Jim DeMint, Republican of South Carolina, said he would not allow the nomination to proceed until Dr. von Eschenbach took action to suspend sales of RU-486, the abortion drug. The F.D.A is not expected to take any such action soon.Any senator can place a “hold” on a presidential nomination, preventing the full Senate from voting on it.With so little time left in the current session, even a brief delay in voting on Dr. von Eschenbach’s nomination would probably end his chances of being confirmed until December at the earliest. If the Senate fails to act before January, President Bush would have to renominate him.The F.D.A. has been without a confirmed commissioner for all but 18 months of the Bush administration.Previously, Mrs. Clinton and Senator Patty Murray, Democrat of Washington, had held up Dr. von Eschenbach’s nomination as a protest against the agency’s three-year delay in deciding whether to allow over-the-counter sales of the emergency contraceptive Plan B. Last month, Dr. von Eschenbach approved the Plan B application, removing the Democrats’ objections.Mr. Enzi noted that he and Mr. Kennedy had written a bill that proposes overhauling the way the F.D.A. monitors the safety of marketed drugs.“It’s hard to do those kinds of reforms without a confirmed commissioner,” Mr. Enzi said.'"
"'06-09-21,'0','Wells College, on Cayuga Lake in upstate New York, was established in 1868 and began admitting men last year. And at Marymount College for women in Tarrytown, N.Y., which merged with Fordham University in 2002, next spring’s graduation will be the last, after 100 years.For these institutions, the decision to admit men is not without risk. Many of the women enrolled are passionate about single-sex education and have bitterly opposed the changes with petitions, protests and lawsuits. Alumnae, who may be even more passionate, have threatened to withhold donations.But college trustees and administrators say they have little choice. Only 3.4 percent of girls graduating from high school last year who took the SAT said they would apply to women’s colleges, according to the College Board, down from 5 percent 10 years ago.That statistic is cited over and over by presidents of women’s colleges in interviews about their future. “The market is telling us young women don’t want to come to single-sex colleges,” Ms. Worden said.She said Randolph-Macon, founded over a century ago, had paid a hefty price for staying single sex. To attract and retain students, she said, the college awards 99 percent of them financial aid, and the typical discount is 62 percent, much of it merit based. That means that despite tuition and fees of more than $30,000, the typical student pays $13,000, Ms. Worden said. These subsidies have been a persistent drain on the $140 million endowment.Nationally, most women who attend single-sex colleges say they chose their institutions despite the absence of men, not because of it. At Randolph-Macon, 4 in 10 students transfer to other, usually coeducational, colleges or universities.But among the 6 in 10 who remain, many are fiercely dedicated to attending college without men. “Every single student on this campus has a leadership position in something,” said Anne Haley, a senior who is leading the protesters here. The week after the board’s decision, about 300 students stayed away from classes, and 200 put in requests to transfer to other institutions, a severe blow for a student body of 712, if they follow through.David W. Strauss, a partner at the Art & Science Group, a marketing firm in Baltimore that has advised all-female colleges, including Randolph-Macon, said his firm’s research suggested that most women, even those attending single-sex colleges, would prefer a coeducational institution. “If you look at this over time,” Mr. Strauss said, “the proportion of college-bound women who say they would consider a women’s-only college has been on a long and steep decline.”Susan E. Lennon, director of the nonprofit Women’s College Coalition, said the opening of once all-male bastions in the Ivy League and elsewhere and Title IX legislation that ramped up women’s sports programs have made it tougher for women’s colleges to survive. Yet national surveys show that women who attend these institutions are more engaged and successful academically than those in mixed environments, Ms. Lennon said.Mr. Strauss said women’s colleges often wanted to use this sort of research to present themselves as places where women could thrive without having to compete with men. But that marketing may not work, he said, because potential applicants do not see themselves as needing protection from competition with men.“Their sense is that the women’s college has something of the broken wing, of women who need a cloistered environment,” he said. “High-performing young women tend to see themselves as high-performing students, and not as students in need of some kind of special care.”In the uproar over Randolph-Macon’s decision, Sweet Briar College and Hollins University, sister institutions to Randolph-Macon for more than a century, publicly rededicated themselves to remaining single sex.Elisabeth Showalter Muhlenfeld, president of Sweet Briar, said that since 2004 the college had focused on raising enrollment by emphasizing hands-on experience and opportunities to study abroad. So far, enrollment has grown to just over 600 students, from 557, and Dr. Muhlenfeld said she is hopeful that it can top 700.Trinity (Washington) University, once a women’s college for upper-crust Roman Catholics, has embraced a new mission of educating low-income women in the Washington region. Virtually all are on financial aid, and the institution manages by attracting large corporate donors.But at Randolph-Macon, administrators saw no other options.Ms. Worden, a former chairwoman of the board who stepped in as interim president while Randolph-Macon weighed going coeducational, said she had some regret about the move but was excited about the prospects for growth. But she said the advantage of an all-women’s campus was apparent even in the current protests. Though the two sides are at loggerheads, there is no undercurrent of enmity or animosity.Before the board’s vote, some protesters gave her a hug, along with a school mascot puppet, a toy bomb and a bottle of calamine lotion, “in case things got too irritating,” she said. The protesters presented an alternative plan that would have preserved the women’s-only campus to the board the night before its vote.In all this, Ms. Worden sees women finding their own path toward negotiating and protesting — purposeful, balanced and constructive.Undoubtedly, there is a place for women’s colleges. What is missing, she said, is the market for it.'"
"'06-09-21,'0','Understanding the older customer is one of two advantages he says the company has. “Our customers are sizes 10, 12 and 14 — we’re reaching the baby boomers who are in their 50’s,” said Mr. Rudes, who is 77 years old and has worked in the apparel business since he was a teenager.“Oh, but I know women of 38 who love these jeans,” said Ms. Sandel, 42, who speaks to customers at department and specialty stores around the country as part of NYDJ’s marketing.Whatever their age, women evidently are buying the product. “The year we brought out Tummy Tuck, our sales went to $7 million from $2.2 million the previous year when we were in St. Germain,” Mr. Rudes said, referring to the 26-year-old company that he has closed, at least for now. And this year, “we’ll do $40 million.”Tummy Tuck jeans, which retail for $88 a pair at Nordstrom, Dillard’s, Macy’s and Bloomingdales and 1,000 specialty stores, are a fashion product, he explained, a niche in the enormous blue jeans market where 450 million pairs are sold every year.But being in the fashion segment calls up the other advantage Mr. Rudes claims for his company: NYDJ jeans are made in the United States from denim fabric imported from China. “The great majority of jeans sell for under $30 a pair at Wal-Mart, Costco and other mass retailers and they can wait the 90 to 120 days it takes to get delivery from China,” Mr. Rudes explained. “But stores want up-to-the-minute fashion and quick changes, so you have to make the products here.”NYDJ, which does the designing, finishing and shipping, relies on a network of specialized factories to do the cutting, sewing and laundering. And those factories are not in other countries, but close by in the busy industrial streets near downtown Los Angeles.It is a surprisingly vibrant complex of businesses for an industry that many people think went overseas a long time ago. There are 11,529 companies in the Los Angeles and Southern California textile and apparel industry, a larger garment industry than in any other American city, according to Ilse Metchek, head of the California Fashion Association, an industry group. They employ 122,362 workers.To be sure, there are fewer employees today than worked here a decade ago. But currently business is brisk because modern retailers want flexibility and speed.For example Moshe Tsabag, owner of Hot Kiss, a maker of clothing and accessories for teenage girls, needs “quick turnaround time because the stores are demanding quicker deliveries to react to new trends.” Mr. Tsabag, who has 28 years in the garment trade, said, “It’s difficult to find enough contractors in Los Angeles to handle all the work.”He could have a new supplier in Karl Nusser, a garment industry entrepreneur from South Africa who came to Los Angeles three months ago and purchased California Sewing Services, a contractor with 160 industrial sewing machines. Mr. Nusser plans to offer garment makers and retailers more than sewing services by acquiring other contractors. “It could be cheaper to have a one-stop shop from pattern making to finished garment,” he said.On the other hand, specialization and decentralization are age-old in the business. Todd Rutkin Inc., for example, is a cutting service dating to 1966. The company now has six computerized cutting machines slicing fabric precisely in a high-ceilinged room resembling an airplane hangar at its south Los Angeles factory.The factory is run by Jan Rutkin, president and daughter of the founder. Cutting is a tough business, Ms. Rutkin said. “In a $20 garment, 50 cents is the cutting,” she said. “You need a lot of volume.”It is a tough business but one that creates a variety of jobs in the Los Angeles area. Operators of expensive computerized machinery can make $15 an hour with benefits, Ms. Rutkin said. And employees who gain advanced skills can move up.Sela Garcia, who took special courses as Los Angeles Trade Tech College, is a manager in the grading and marking department at Todd Rutkin. She must enter patterns on a computer program, calculating how machines are to cut garments in all the various sizes and dimensions. Ms Garcia is paid more than $50,000 a year, Ms. Rutkin said.Some jobs are unique. Margie Milaney, for example, is a “fit” model. That is, she is a perfect size 8, so clothing is tested on her and adjusted to make it fit without hitches or wrinkles. Patterns for other sizes are adjusted up and down from size 8. Ms. Milaney, 67, models for many companies, including Wal-Mart and Not Your Daughter’s Jeans — at rates of $175 an hour, according to George Rudes. How does she remain a perfect size 8? “I exercise and watch what I eat,” Ms. Milaney said. “Wal-Mart measures you every month.”Of course, in a fast-moving field like apparel, NYDJ’s success with Tummy Tuck jeans could be threatened by competitors producing a reinforced jean of their own. “You cannot patent a clothing design,” Ms. Metchek of California Fashion pointed out.Mr. Rudes is not concerned, because working with stretch fabrics is not so easy, he said. Mr. Rudes recalled starting out selling fabric for his father’s company in New York: “I’d go to every apparel house and say ‘we have brown, do you want to buy brown?’ ”And now, Ms. Sandel said, “NYDJ is producing other styles and colors, including Tummy Tuck skirts in brown corduroy. Chocolate brown is the new black.”'"
"'06-09-21,'0','LONDON, Sept. 20 — A British scientific group, the Royal Society, contends that Exxon Mobil is spreading “inaccurate and misleading” information about climate change and is financing groups that misinform the public on the issue.The Royal Society, a 1,400-member organization that dates back to the 1600’s and has counted Isaac Newton and Albert Einstein as members, asked Exxon Mobil in a letter this month to stop financing these groups and to change its public reports to reflect more accurately the opinions of scientists on the issue.There is a “false sense somehow that there is a two-sided debate going on in the scientific community” about the origins of climate change, said Bob Ward, the senior manager for policy communication at the Royal Society.The reality is that “thousands and thousands” of scientists around the world agree that climate change is linked to greenhouse gases, he said, with “one or two professional contrarians” who disagree.Dozens of lobbying groups, some of them receiving financing from Exxon Mobil, are relying on these contrarians as experts, Mr. Ward said. Meanwhile, he said, Exxon Mobil writes in documents it distributes to the public that it is difficult to determine the extent to which climate change can be attributed to human actions, a view that, he said, the vast majority of scientists do not share.'"
"'06-09-21,'0','Now Ms. Barkin, 52, has chosen an equally public denouement by putting up for auction the extravagant jewelry that Mr. Perelman lavished on her, having decided to part with more than 100 pieces valued at $15 million — a symbolic and literal purging of the union.“These are just not memories I want to wear out every day,’’ Ms. Barkin said.The trove, to be sold at Christie’s in Rockefeller Center on Oct. 10, includes a 32-carat apricot diamond ring that Mr. Perelman, who is the chairman of Revlon, gave Ms. Barkin weeks before their divorce; a pair of emerald and gold cuffs designed for the Duchess of Windsor, valued at up to $80,000; an emerald necklace that once belonged to Doris Duke that could fetch as much as $350,000; and a selection of pieces by the cult Parisian jeweler JAR. Only 80 to 90 JAR creations are produced each year, said François Curiel, the chairman of Christie’s Europe. “When you have 17 pieces of JAR in an auction, it’s an event.’’For Ms. Barkin, the sale puts a seal of finality on her relationship with Mr. Perelman, whose wish to be single again caught her unawares, she said. A divorce granted by a Manhattan court a few weeks later left her with $20 million under the terms of a prenuptial pact.That fortune notwithstanding, the rupture left Ms. Barkin feeling raw. Her ex-husband’s behavior “was shocking,’’ she said. “What I thought was a commonality was a very different bond.’’Ms. Barkin said a confidentiality agreement prevents her from discussing aspects of the marriage. But in an interview meant to focus on the auction of her jewelry, she did not censor her feelings about the breakup and described some of its causes and the nature of her marriage. Mr. Perelman, through a spokeswoman, declined to respond or otherwise comment.Ms. Barkin said the marriage was founded on genuine affection. “I loved Ronald Perelman,’’ she said. “I can say that unequivocally.’’ Mr. Perelman, she suggested, had struck a cooler bargain.In his mind, she said, “I was an accessory, being accessorized, the perfect one — age-appropriate, the mother of two children, successful in her own right.’’As an actress Ms. Barkin was known for steamy performances in movies like “The Big Easy” and “Switch.’’ Yet she was also the attentive mother of two children by the actor Gabriel Byrne, and projected an aura of matronly respectability. “I was an actress who for 20-some years had never left her children once to do a movie,’’ Ms. Barkin said. “That looked good.’’“And you know I wasn’t a bimb,’’ Ms. Barkin said, less with rancor than regret. “I was a good get.’’She said that Mr. Perelman did not want her away from his side for the months it takes to make a movie, so except for small parts, she put her career on hold. “When I met Ronald Perelman I wasn’t going to travel,’’ she said. “That made it more difficult to work, but that was kind of fine with me.’’Some 18 months ago, Ms. Barkin accepted a cameo in “Ocean’s Twelve,’’ the sequel to “Ocean’s Eleven,’’ a role requiring her to spend 36 hours on a film set in Chicago. Her part was later cut, but it caused a rupture in the marriage, she said: “That had enormous repercussions. After that cameo I moved out of the house with my children. So it didn’t go well. It never went smoothly when I worked.’’But they were reconciled and she moved back in. And if things were sometimes rocky, she was nevertheless stunned by the suddenness of the breakup. “You don’t spend years with someone and they’re just Photoshopped out of your life,” she said.She noted what she considered to be a paradox: Mr. Perelman, she said, was attracted to her because she was a movie star, but objected when she wanted to keep making films. “It’s that old thing, you are drawn to a person for certain reasons, and then they try to change you,’’ she said.Single again, she has started a film production company with her brother, George Barkin, and it is into that enterprise that she plans to channel the proceeds from the sale of her jewelry.Friends say that Ms. Barkin is resilient. Putting the baubles of the marriage up for auction is a way of bouncing back, said Diane Von Furstenberg, the designer. “That was very healthy,’’ Ms. Von Furstenberg said. “Now she can be herself.’’She has lost almost 10 pounds since the divorce, and looked girlishly slender in a black Rick Owens T-shirt and Yohji Yamamoto trousers, swinging a leg elastically over the back of the sofa in her trailer.Her expression, too, was in animated contrast to the Restylane mask worn by many women in Hollywood. She has a habit of scrunching her features — lips compressed, eyes squeezed to slits — buying time to reflect before answering even innocuous questions.That signature expression was in place even while describing her jewelry, much of which she said she chose herself. Many of the pieces, like a seven-strand natural pearl necklace and a 15-carat diamond ring, are chunky and audacious. They are “unapologetic, I guess,’’ Ms. Barkin said, “And I wasn’t precious about wearing my precious jewels.’’She routinely wore a 16.94-carat diamond pendant, valued at $600,000 to $800,000, to bed. Several years ago, she was seen at New York fashion shows absently fidgeting with a nickel-size diamond ring.Except for a diamond ring given to her by Joel Rosenthal, the designer of JAR, whom she considers a friend, she is parting with all the jewelry from the marriage, eager to shed the image of a gem-freighted trophy wife.“I am not a fantasist,’’ she said. “And certainly, I was never the little girl who dreamt about some rich guy buying her jewelry.’’The younger of two children in a lower-middle class Jewish family, she grew up in Kew Gardens Hills in Queens. She has boasted in other interviews of fistfights with gangs of girls in the neighborhood. “I certainly wasn’t a thug,’’ she said. “But my mother worked, my father worked. You learned how to take care of yourself. I was as tough as I needed to be.’’Something of that scrappiness surfaced in her 20’s, during stints as a downtown waitress working in a string of restaurants run by the New York nightlife impresario Mickey Ruskin, the owner of Max’s Kansas City and the Ocean Club. “I was feisty, sure,’’ she said, unabashed. “If somebody didn’t leave a tip for a waitress and that waitress wasn’t me, I would follow them out the door, yelling ‘Was something wrong with your service?’ ”She was thorny on movie sets as well, known to stalk off in tears when her lines didn’t suit her, but fiercely intent, those who worked with her say, on giving every part her best. Her ferocity led Gordon Cotler, the writer and a producer of a television movie in which she appeared, to predict in 1993, in a letter to The New York Times, that “if some producer didn’t strangle her first, she would be a star.’’Despite memorably sexy roles, and a reputation as an actor’s actor, Ms. Barkin never attained the A-list stature of Michelle Pfeiffer or Julia Roberts. Since marrying Mr. Perelman, she has taken on only a handful of bite-size parts, notably in the 2004 film “Palindromes,” in which she played the anguished mother of a wayward teenage girl.She did not fight to land her latest role as a curtly efficient assistant to Mr. Pacino in “Ocean’s 13.’’ “I’ve never been ambitious,’’ she insisted. “I’m a big believer in being in the right place at the right time.’’She ascribed the recent upturn in her career to luck — and the generosity of the movie’s director, Steven Soderbergh, and one of its producers, Jerry Weintraub.She was sitting on the beach at a friend’s vacation house after her divorce, Ms. Barkin recalled, mulling over her own contribution to the failure of her marriage, when her phone rang. “It was Jerry asking, ‘How are you doing?’ I said ‘Not so good,’ ” she recalled, her eyes welling. “He said: ‘You’re going to feel better in about 30 seconds. You’re the female lead in ‘Ocean’s Thirteen.’ ”'"

"'06-09-21,'0','At the start of Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie’s instantly enthralling second novel, a 13-year-old bumpkin named Ugwu becomes the houseboy of Odenigbo, an urbane mathematics professor. The time is the early 1960’s, the setting southeastern Nigeria. Odenigbo insists on being called Master and patronizingly tries to instruct his new servant in matters of etiquette and academics. But the boy needs no help educating himself. He very quickly notices that Master’s clean, dainty toes belong to feet that always wear shoes.Ugwu is eager and ambitious. He makes a point of speaking English instead of his native Igbo. He does not know the meaning of words like sophist, but he resents hearing Master’s intellectual friends toss them about. At the same time he becomes fiercely protective of his new boss and extremely interested in Olanna, Odenigbo’s privileged girlfriend.Olanna is very beautiful, unlike her acerbic twin sister, Kainene. “The benefit of being the ugly daughter is that nobody uses you as sex bait,” Kainene remarks. Both women are well aware of their family’s wealth and power, and both presume this is armor against adversity. Both attract the interest of a white Englishman named Richard, a sometime journalist trying to write a book about Nigeria, who is involved with Susan, a brittle white Englishwoman, as the book begins. For Susan, Richard’s writing amounts to “the best of her hobbies.” When Richard begins falling for Kainene, he is astonished that the fiercely jealous Susan doesn’t notice. Racism keeps her from recognizing Kainene as competition.It doesn’t take long for Ms. Adichie to weave these characters into a finely wrought, inescapable web. In a major leap forward from her impressive debut novel, “Purple Hibiscus” (Algonquin Books, 2003), she expands expertly and inexorably on these early scenes. And the many-faceted “Half of a Yellow Sun” soon develops a panoramic span. Taking its title from an emblem on the flag of Biafra, the book sustains an intimate focus and an epic backdrop as Biafra secedes from Nigeria and genocidal hell breaks loose.“Half of a Yellow Sun” is not a conventional war story any more than is “A Farewell to Arms” or “For Whom the Bell Tolls.” (Though the Nigerian-born Ms. Adichie, who divides her time between Nigeria and the United States, has been compared mostly to African writers, she warrants many different comparisons.) It is a story whose characters live in a changing wartime atmosphere, doing their best to keep that atmosphere at bay. And while the ravages of the Biafran war are well known, they do not manifest themselves in predictable or one-note ways here. For Ms. Adichie, famine in Biafra is not only a source of horror. It is also, the book wryly mentions, something that made parents all over the world tell their children to eat.The author manipulates time and point of view to powerful effect. “Half of a Yellow Sun” introduces its characters at their most comfortable and optimistic. Then she leaps forward a section called “The Late Sixties” — or, more precisely, to the speech delivered by Major Chukwuma Kaduna Nzeogwu in January 1966, announcing Nigeria’s first military coup, which would prompt Biafra’s secession the following year. The characters become acutely watchful as war approaches. “Whenever he drained a pot of boiled beans, he thought of the slimy sink as politician,” the book says of Ugwu.'"

Though clearly aimed at teenagers, this unashamedly heartstruck movie is neither obsessed with sex nor driven to humiliate its characters. Compared to those of the average American teen movie, its ambitions are so innocent they’re almost childlike.A simple tale of beauty, the geek and the Internet, “Train Man” follows the halting courtship of a 22-year-old nerd (Takayuki Yamada) and his subway crush (Miki Nakatani) after he rescues her from an inebriated businessman. Egged on by a Greek chorus of envious chat-room buddies — who wisely advise a total makeover — our hero learns that wooing a woman requires more than an in-depth knowledge of anime. Who knew?Candy-colored and wide-eyed, “Train Man” is based on Hitori Nakano’s wildly popular novel and directed by Shosuke Murakami with touching tenderness. Though its appeal may be limited to the socially awkward, the movie is unusually perceptive about the attractions of online communities while gently insisting on the superiority of flesh over fantasy. “Train Man” wants us to get off our computers and get out of the house; in a country as technocentric as Japan, the suggestion that it may be time to replace the cyber with the real is not just subversive, it’s downright revolutionary.Directed by Shosuke Murakami; written (in Japanese, with English subtitles) by Arisa Kaneko, based on the book by Hitori Nakano; directors of photography, Yoshihiro Katayama and Shigeki Murano; edited by Junosuke Hogaki; music by Takayuki Hattori with theme song by Orange Range; visual effects by Hirofumi Yoshikawa; art director, Kazuo Yanagawa; produced by Yoshishige Shimatani, Yoshikazu Seki, Yoshiro Hosono and Yoshiro Yasunaga; released by Viz Pictures.

"'06-09-22,'0','Nike, the world’s No. 1 maker of sport shoes, said yesterday that quarterly net profit fell 13 percent as stock-based compensation weighed on results. The quarter still exceeded Wall Street estimates.Net income for the fiscal first quarter of 2007 was $377.2 million, or $1.47 a share, compared with $432.3 million, or $1.61 a share, in the period a year ago. Sales rose 9 percent, to $4.2 billion, said the company, which is based in Beaverton, Ore.Wall Street, on average, had forecast earnings per share of $1.41 on revenue of $4.17 billion, according to Reuters estimates.Stock-based compensation reduced earnings per share during the quarter by 16 cents, Nike said. Excluding the compensation, net income declined 3 percent.Orders for athletic footwear and apparel scheduled for delivery from September through January were up 6 percent over the same period last year, Nike said.Some retail analysts have recently cited concerns that Nike’s higher-priced footwear, already facing weak demand in some major markets like Britain and Japan, may face similar problems in the United States.'"

The sheriff’s office said it had uncovered videotape of a man officials believe is the marine, Lance Hering, 21, buying a bus ticket in Denver shortly after 6 a.m. on Aug. 30. That day rescuers began an elaborate search for Mr. Hering, who was on leave when he and a friend, Steve Powers, 20, went hiking in Eldorado Canyon. Mr. Powers said Mr. Hering fell during the hike and was knocked unconscious. On Wednesday, officials showed the videotape to Mr. Hering’s parents who, the sheriff’s office said, were 99 percent sure that their son is the person buying the ticket.'"
"'06-09-22,'0','But what may yet emerge — Hewlett-Packard delivered more than 5,000 pages of documents to investigators with the House Committee on Energy and Commerce this week, and more are expected Monday — is what seems to have worried investors and analysts.“To the degree it impacts the C.E.O., that is something we are nervous about,” said A. M. Sacconaghi, an analyst who tracks Hewlett-Packard for Sanford C. Bernstein & Company. But he said that “at this point the probability is very low” that Mr. Hurd, credited with turning the company around since his hiring in March 2005, might face criminal charges or be forced out.Mr. Hurd offered Thursday to testify at a House subcommittee hearing on the case next Thursday. Several other Hewlett-Packard executives have also been asked to appear.In addition, the company said the Securities and Exchange Commission was seeking records and information related to the resignation of Thomas J. Perkins from the board in May. It was Mr. Perkins’s effort to force the company to acknowledge the reason for his resignation — his objection to the leak investigation — that brought the operation into public view.Since then, documents have shown that Hewlett-Packard’s detectives not only gained phone records of directors, employees, journalists and others, but also tried to plant software on a reporter’s computer to track a bogus document it sent her and even considered infiltrating newsrooms with spies masquerading as clerical workers or cleaners.E-mail messages between company officials, cited Thursday in The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal, show efforts to organize a briefing for Mr. Hurd last January, when the leak investigation entered an intense phase over a news account of a senior management meeting. It is not clear whether the briefing occurred.Another message said Mr. Hurd pointed to five potential leakers on the board at that juncture. And The Washington Post reported that e-mail from the company’s chairwoman, Patricia C. Dunn, cited Mr. Hurd as “fine with both the concept and the content” of the software tracking effort.Mr. Lockyer, the California attorney general, said Thursday that he did not know yet whether the state would find culpability among senior officials in the company. “We haven’t ruled anything in or out,” he said. “We want to know who committed the wrongdoing.”The company promised that Mr. Hurd would answer questions at a news conference Friday afternoon, after the stock market’s close, but the timing of the events also put investors on edge. “Traditionally in corporate America, bad news is delivered on a Friday after the markets close,” Mr. Sacconaghi said.Several people with close ties to board members said Mr. Hurd was preparing a plan to present to the board for how get the company beyond its current problems. It may announce dismissals or resignations, though that course could present other problems. Ex-employees have no incentive to protect the company or its executives or managers.Hewlett-Packard’s chairwoman, Ms. Dunn, has acknowledged that she authorized the internal inquiry, and documents have shown that she involved herself in it. Other documents show that Kevin T. Hunsaker, a senior company lawyer, directed the operation, which involved Hewlett-Packard investigators and several layers of outside detectives and their subcontractors.Mr. Hunsaker has hired a San Diego criminal defense lawyer, Michael Pancer. Ann O. Baskins, the company’s general counsel, to whom Mr. Hunsaker reported, has hired Cristina C. Arguedas, a white-collar crime specialist with the law firm of Arguedas, Cassman & Headley in Berkeley, Calif.Mr. Hurd has been popular with investors because he is transforming Hewlett-Packard from a lumbering technology company content to live off the profits of its lucrative ink-cartridge business into a growth company. Hewlett is projected to bring in $91.2 billion in revenue this year — enough to make it the largest technology company in the world.Oddly, the internal animosities exposed in the disclosures from the leak investigation had their roots in the activities of a board subcommittee established in 2002 to help the company make smarter technology strategy decisions.After its contentious $25 billion merger with Compaq Computer, the board and some top executives became bitterly divided over how quickly the computer business could grow and how it should invest in the future, according to a person with direct knowledge of the divisions within the board.Established at the urging of Mr. Perkins, a Silicon Valley venture capitalist who returned to the company as a director after the Compaq merger in 2002, the technology subcommittee routinely met a day before each board meeting to thrash out technology strategy issues and wrestle with how to restart growth at Hewlett-Packard.The subcommittee was dominated by directors who maintained that the company could grow much more quickly by investing in information technology. Initial members included Mr. Perkins; George A. Keyworth II, a former Reagan administration science adviser; Richard A. Hackborn, a former Hewlett-Packard executive; and Lawrence T. Babbio Jr., vice chairman of Verizon. Shane V. Robison, the executive in charge of research and development, attended the meetings.Mr. Hurd began attending after he joined the company, succeeding Carleton S. Fiorina as chief executive. It was where the most spirited deliberations about Hewlett-Packard’s future took place, a person briefed on the sessions said.But Ms. Dunn, who had become chairwoman, did not take part, and some subcommittee members have concluded that her exclusion rankled her. She and several other directors were skeptical of large research investments in computing, a person with detailed knowledge of the subcommittee’s activities said.“The conflict on the board wasn’t about personalities; it was about growth strategies,” said Mark Stahlman, a financial industry analyst who is now a strategist at Gartner Invest, a Wall Street research firm.Friends of Ms. Dunn, who asked not to be identified, said some of the animosity could also be traced to the period when Mr. Hurd was hired. Mr. Perkins, Mr. Keyworth and Ms. Dunn were in charge of the search committee, and while they agreed about Mr. Hurd, Ms. Dunn became angry with leaks from the board about the search, those friends said.Mr. Perkins and Mr. Keyworth became targets in both phases of the leak investigation, around the time of Ms. Fiorina’s dismissal and again early this year. Their resulting confrontation with Ms. Dunn — Mr. Keyworth was identified as a source of unauthorized disclosures — ended in their resignations.Nonetheless, with Ms. Dunn’s decision last week to step down as chairwoman in January, to be succeeded by Mr. Hurd, the strategic dispute was settled. “The growth faction has now won,” Mr. Stahlman said.In a filing Thursday with the S.E.C., the company said Mr. Perkins and Mr. Keyworth, who resigned after Ms. Dunn stepped down, had agreed not to sue Hewlett-Packard, and the company had agreed to pay expenses arising from government inquiries or legal proceedings in the spying fiasco. The company and the former directors signed mutual non-disparagement agreements.'"
"'06-09-22,'0','But it was not clear how much money will ultimately go to the effort, because the businesses involved cannot necessarily count on generating as much in profits as Sir Richard has set as his goal.Sir Richard said his companies were already engaged in developing an aviation fuel not derived from oil, along with better processes for making bio-fuels from grasses and other crops. Conventional bio-fuels now require a great deal of fossil fuel to manufacture.Sir Richard said the prime goal was not making money, but financing research on ways to provide energy in a world of growing populations and economies without overheating the planet.“Some will be profitable, some will not be profitable,” he said at a news conference. “But the only way global warming is going to be beaten is to invest in new fuels that can actually replace fossil fuels.”Ted Turner, one of the progenitors of 10-figure philanthropy with his $1 billion pledge to the United Nations in 1997, called Sir Richard’s plan a “brilliant move,” both as an investment and as a way to protect the global environment.“I’m looking to make investments in renewable clean energy myself,” Mr. Turner said. “He’ll probably make more money off of this than he would off the airlines themselves.”Sir Richard (he was knighted by Queen Elizabeth in 1999 for promotion of entrepreneurship) is a household name in Britain, where he is known for outlandish self-promotional stunts, an avant-garde approach to business and a voracious appetite for new ventures, no matter how small or unusual.Now 56, he began his career at 20 with a mail-order record business. It expanded into a record label that put out the first recording of the Sex Pistols, and went on to distribute Genesis, UB40 and others. Virgin Music was sold in 1992 for $1 billion.His private company, Virgin Group, has played the parent to a host of different Virgin ventures from airlines to mobile phones to wine sales and railroads. The emphasis is always on presenting customers with a different, more entertaining way of doing something — often accompanied by blatantly sexy advertising or marketing.Sir Richard usually owns a big chunk of most of these new companies. The complicated and often private books of the companies, some of which are registered offshore, are difficult for most outsiders to penetrate.Like any entrepreneur, he has had some high-profile failures, like Virgin Cola, and a reality television show that never attracted much of an audience. But he has had equally high-profile successes. This year, for example, he sold Virgin Mobile in a deal that personally netted Sir Richard £690 million ($1.3 billion) in cash and stock.His list of promotional stunts is long. He has dressed as a bride, a stewardess, a can of soda and a pirate. He has posed nearly nude in Times Square (to promote Virgin Mobile’s lack of hidden fees), and flown to press conferences via jet pack or dangling from wires off helicopters. Plans to sail around the world in a balloon were scrapped after several tries.Like Donald Trump, to whom he is sometimes compared, Sir Richard usually operates with partners who often put up much of the money for his ventures. The transportation assets are co-owned by Sir Richard and other investors: Singapore Airlines owns 49 percent of Virgin Atlantic, for example.Virgin Blue, the Australian carrier, is publicly traded, though Sir Richard retains a stake, as is Virgin Express, the European carrier.In addition to the profits pledged to the effort, said Will Whitehorn, a Virgin Group spokesman, any money earned from sales of equity stakes in these businesses will be invested in the fuel ventures as well. He added that the group had already raised $300 million toward the investment, by selling thetrainline.com, a British Web site for selling train tickets.Many experts say private and government research on nonpolluting energy options has lagged, even in the face of growing evidence of risks from rising concentrations of greenhouse gases. Should Sir Richard’s money flow as pledged, the research effort could end up exceeding similar efforts by individual governments.In February, President Bush announced a bio-fuels initiative for 2007 of $150 million, nearly a 60 percent increase over spending on such fuels in the previous budget.The overall United States budget for research in renewable energy sources like wind, solar, hydrogen and farmed fuels is a bit over $1 billion a year, but that amount is far less than what was spent during the oil shock of the 1970’s.And while drug and semiconductor companies typically invest 10 percent or more of revenue into research, in the energy industry the typical research budget is about 0.3 percent of revenue, said Daniel M. Kammen, an energy expert at the University of California, Berkeley.Kathleen D. McCarthy, director of the Center for the Study of Philanthropy at the City University of New York Graduate Center, said the scale, duration and style of Sir Richard’s pledge were indicative of a deep shift in the way wealthy people were pursuing a legacy.“This is all new — the scale, the vision, the techniques and the decentralized nature of it,” she said. “Branson is also specifically focusing on an issue that’s not being adequately addressed.’’Sir Richard said his new commitment grew out of a visit to his London home a few months ago by former Vice President Al Gore, who is on a prolonged worldwide speaking tour to promote “An Inconvenient Truth,” his documentary and book about global warming.“You are in a position maybe to make a difference,” Sir Richard said Mr. Gore told him. “If you can make a giant step forward other people will follow.”'"
"'06-09-22,'0','Alberto R. Gonzales, the United States attorney general, has imposed a set of highly restrictive rules generally reserved for terror suspects on an imprisoned mob figure who is under investigation for plotting to kill a federal judge, a prosecutor and three Mafia turncoats, prosecutors disclosed yesterday.The move was the latest development in an increasingly bizarre case. The mob figure in the case, Vincent Basciano, has contended that a list he wrote naming the judge and the others was not part of a murder plot, as prosecutors have asserted, but an effort to use a mystical religion to improve his chances at his forthcoming trial, at which he could face the death penalty.The disclosure that Mr. Gonzales had imposed the measures was made at a hearing in United States District Court in Brooklyn. The judge in the case, Nicholas G. Garaufis, who prosecutors have said was one of Mr. Basciano’s targets, also unsealed a transcript from an Aug. 28 hearing at which the investigation and the list were discussed.In July, Mr. Basciano provided the list to a fellow inmate at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in Manhattan who, unknown to Mr. Basciano, was cooperating with the authorities. Prosecutors have said Mr. Basciano indicated to the inmate that he wanted the people on the list killed.The transcript of the Aug. 28 hearing provided additional details about what Mr. Basciano, known as Vinny Gorgeous, has said was his effort to use Santeria, a Caribbean religion, to influence the outcome of the trial.'"

"'06-09-22,'0','MOSCOW, Sept. 21 — Russia is making an early gamble in its Davis Cup semifinal match against the United States by leaving Nikolay Davydenko out of the opening singles on Friday.It was widely expected that Davydenko would be dominant on a slow clay court, which the Russians selected especially to spike the firepower of Andy Roddick and James Blake.Shamil Tarpischev, Russia’s veteran captain, apparently was not pleased by Davydenko’s decision to charge off to Beijing to compete in an ATP event immediately after reaching the semifinals of the United States Open.“I am tired; I am not playing so good,” said Davydenko, who defaulted a match in Beijing, saying he felt dizzy.Marat Safin, the benefactor of Russia’s surprise move, gave a weary look when asked about it. “Nikolay has been around the world,” he said.'"
"'06-09-22,'0','Members of Mr. Faso’s gubernatorial campaign staff said this activity did not constitute lobbying, because the Public Asset Fund is an arm of the state, so his work with the governor’s office was not covered by the state’s lobbying law. They said Mr. Faso had been responding to requests from the governor’s office to comment on the legislation.“This was not lobbying,” said Susan Del Percio, a spokeswoman for Mr. Faso. “It was advising on how to get the process done, and advising on the legislation itself, saying what was needed to get the job done.”State law defines lobbying as “any attempt to influence the passage or defeat of any legislation by either house of the State Legislature or approval or disapproval of any legislation by the governor.” Lobbyists who earn more than $5,000 a year are required to register with the state.Lobbyists for government departments are not required to register, but some quasi-governmental entities, like the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, the Power Authority and the Thruway Authority, are required to register their lobbying activities because they are defined as public benefit corporations.The Faso campaign said Mr. Faso was not required to register because the Public Asset Fund is a state entity, not a public benefit corporation, but government lawyers were divided as to whether the fund is a public benefit corporation.Blair Horner, the legislative director of the New York Public Interest Research Group, which monitors lobbying, called on the state’s lobbying commission to review the matter. “The lobbying commission should review this arrangement and offer a ruling on whether what Faso did constituted lobbying or not,” Mr. Horner said. “It’s quacking, but under New York law, that doesn’t necessarily mean it’s a duck.”Lobbying has been a campaign issue for Mr. Faso. Both his Republican and Democratic opponents have emphasized his work as a lobbyist, hoping to capitalize on the notoriety of the Jack Abramoff scandal in Washington and criticism of lobbyists’ power in Albany.The Public Asset Fund was created by the state to handle the sale of billions of dollars worth of stock that the state was given when it allowed the old Empire Blue Cross and Blue Shield to become a profit-making health insurance company. The fund has five members, three appointed by the governor, one by the Senate and one by the Assembly.The law establishing the fund refers to its “corporate existence” but does not explicitly call it a public benefit corporation.In 2002, a financial firm working on the stock sale sought a legal opinion about the fund. Its lawyers, Hinman Straub, wrote that the fund “is not an agency, department, board, officer, commission, or institution of the state,” and noted that the members were not allowed to be state employees. That opinion could buttress a contention that Mr. Faso’s activities amounted to lobbying.On the other hand, a 2004 letter from the office of State Comptroller Alan G. Hevesi, a Democrat, argued that the fund was part of the state, not a public benefit corporation.Michael Marr, a spokesman for Governor Pataki, said, “The Public Asset Fund is a state entity, and as such is exempted from the state’s lobbying law.”Patrick J. Bulgaro, a former member of the fund’s board who was appointed by Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, a Democrat, said he always assumed that the fund was a public benefit corporation, which would put it under lobbying laws. “If the argument is made that it is not,” he said in an interview, “then it’s the strangest entity I’ve encountered in my career.”Failing to report lobbying is punishable by a fine of up to $25,000.Mr. Faso billed the state $560 an hour for his work for the Public Asset Fund, according to billing records obtained under the Freedom of Information Law. The records show that he earned more than $37,000 for his work for the fund, and that his law firm, Manatt, Phelps & Phillips, earned much more.Mr. Faso, who was a government and regulatory partner at the firm, did register as a lobbyist for four clients: a health care company, a life insurance trade group, an environmental group, and a group working to take over the Seventh Regiment Armory in Manhattan. He did not register for the Public Asset Fund.The records show that in his work for the fund, Mr. Faso was in daily contact with the governor’s office the week that the bill passed. A typical entry, for June 23, 2005, reads, “Numerous calls/memos/emails with Governor’s office and firms re legislation.” Another entry, after the Legislature passed the bill, was for a discussion with the governor’s office “re bill signing.”A letter Mr. Faso wrote to the fund in September, summarizing his work, says, “There were numerous calls and drafting suggestions before the Legislature did, in fact, enact the provisions essentially as suggested by the Fund.”As it prepared to sell the stock, the fund awarded some contracts to politically connected insiders. Aside from the legal work that went to Mr. Faso, a former leader of the Republican minority in the Assembly, underwriting work went to firms that employed people with ties to the governor and the administration.'"
"'06-09-22,'0','The company disclosed in August that it planned to restate earnings because of questions about the timing of the options. Yesterday, it said the cumulative effect of the restatement reduced net income by $89.2 million. Although Cablevision did not provide details, it said the restatement was related in large part to the options adjustment but also included some smaller issues related to stock-based compensation.Cablevision also said that two directors, Richard Hochman, who served on the audit and compensation committees, and Victor Oristano, who was on the audit committee, had resigned from those panels, but that they remained on the board.Cablevision said Mr. Hochman and Mr. Oristano had resigned from the committees because of the “public attention generated by the company’s decision to restate its financial statements as a result of the stock option review” as well as lawsuits filed in the wake of that decision.Nell Minow, editor of the Corporate Library, a watchdog organization that tracks corporate practices, questioned why the two men remained on the Cablevision board. “We have heard on the accounting side; what about hearing on the leadership side?” Ms. Minow said. “If this is a board that is enabling dishonest behavior, then they should not be allowed to serve.” A Cablevision spokesman declined to comment.In August, Cablevision said that a number of options granted between 1997 and 2002 carried dates that did not match the actual grant dates. About 1.9 million grants in the period went to five top executives, including the chief executive, James L. Dolan, a son of Cablevision’s founder and controlling shareholder, Charles F. Dolan.About 60 percent of those grants were made on April 17, 1997, when the stock was trading at a quarterly low. Shares rose sharply afterward, giving greater gains to the holders of the options, though they could not be realized until the options were exercised. Holders were permitted to cash in one-third of their options each year for three years.Wall Street appeared to shrug off the restatement in large part because Cablevision reported its second-quarter results at the same time, and its earnings and cash flow were strong. Shares of Cablevision fell 2 cents, to $22.99.Net income fell to $14.6 million, or 5 cents a share, compared with $213.8 million, or 74 cents a share, in the period a year earlier, which included a $240 million gain from discontinued operations. But revenue, reported earlier, increased 15.6 percent, to more than $1.4 billion.Richard Greenfield, a media analyst at Pali Capital, said: “I am glad that they have restated numbers appropriately, but it does not impact the strength of their operating performance. And more broadly, there has always been a Dolan fear among investors that you have to put up with in owning Cablevision.”Cablevision, which also owns the New York Knicks basketball team and the New York Rangers hockey team, has had a number of problems over the years, including a dispute between James Dolan and his father over an investment in a satellite television business.'"
"'06-09-22,'0','The new company would have 7.7 billion euros ($9.8 billion), in annual sales, based on 2005 figures, and about half of that would come from biopharmaceuticals. Merck, which also has a strong presence in manufacturing the liquid crystals that go into flat-screen monitors, reported a pretax profit of 893 million euros last year on 5.9 billion euros in sales.Mr. Bertarelli is an heir to the billionaire Swiss family that owns slightly less than two-thirds of Serono stock, which it will sell to Merck for 1,100 Swiss francs ($880) a share. Merck said that it would finance the acquisition in part through a capital increase of 2 billion to 2.5 billion euros, and that the Merck family, which controls the company, will purchase up to 1 billion euros of that new issue.Shares of Merck declined 3.49 euros, or 4.47 percent, to 74.64 euros in Frankfurt. Serono asked the Zurich stock exchange on Thursday to suspend trading in its shares, which closed Wednesday at 915 Swiss francs.Mr. Bertarelli, a victor in the 2003 America’s Cup sailing competition, has sought a buyer for Serono for much of the year.Giants of the sector, including GlaxoSmithKline and Novartis, had considered the purchase in the last few months, but Merck was too preoccupied with Schering to focus its attention on Serono. Merck began battling for Schering in March but ultimately lost to Bayer.When the major drug makers passed on Serono, Merck made its move.“Serono was always something that we found attractive, but we questioned whether we would have really had a chance,” a Merck spokeswoman, Phyllis Carter, said.Schering would have offered Merck better distribution channels in some regions, like Asia. But Merck appears to have been lucky with Serono, whose stock had been sinking after it failed to find a suitor.“Serono is a second-best choice here,” said Oliver Kämmerer, an analyst with WestLB in Düsseldorf. “But it’s no bad second best, especially at this price.”If it is approved, the deal would create a major new competitor among biopharmaceutical companies, which blend the skills of biotechnology researchers with the disease-treatment expertise of drug makers. A combined Merck-Serono would compete with giants like Amgen and Roche but also with companies with less focus on this field, like Sanofi-Aventis and Schering-Plough, Merck said.“We are now at a stage where a lot of midsize companies are struggling to define themselves in the face of the enormous companies,” said Alexander Lewis, an analyst with the pharmaceutical consulting firm Wood Mackenzie. “The future of many of them will be going into biologicals.”'"
"'06-09-22,'0','The foundation had been looking for two of the images for years: “Chief Before Teepee,’’ an abstract oil painting, and a drawing, “Two Wild Indians,’’ both from 1952. They had last been seen in an exhibition in Indianapolis in 1978. Inspired by the show, Mr. Cowart unearthed these works by sleuthing, he said, and found they both belonged to a collector in West Palm Beach, Fla.Perhaps the most important discovery is a 1951 watercolor, “Death of General Wolfe’’ (of French and Indian War fame), that once belonged to Fairfield Porter. It was found after a friend of Porter from upstate New York contacted the foundation in the wake of the exhibition. It will be shown with another painting, “Death of the General’’ (1951), from another Florida collector who had acquired it from the John Heller Gallery, which represented Lichtenstein in New York in the 1950’s. These works will be seen along with a study for “Death of General Wolfe,’’ owned by the artist’s estate.The two other works are “Two Indians/Two Seminoles’’ (1953), a colorful geometric canvas of a pair of intertwined figures, which a Cleveland family inherited from relatives of Lichtenstein’s first wife. “ We didn’t know it existed,’’ Mr. Cowart said. A Manhattan collector called the museum after seeing the show and informed a curator that he owned “Untitled (Two Chippewa Building Canoe?),’’ a little-known painting from 1952.“All of these are important to the foundation,” Mr. Cowart said. “They expand on the energetic experimentation of his early years.’’Sotheby’s will auction 90 paintings and sculptures from Roger and Josette Vanthournout, relatively unknown Belgian collectors, this fall in a series of sales beginning Nov. 7. The entire collection is estimated at $34.3 million to $47.5 million.Mr. Vanthournout, who died a year ago, was a furniture manufacturer. “He was a very private person with highly sophisticated taste who early on began collecting artists like Picasso and Bacon and then moved on to more abstract things, including Miminalist works by Judd and Andre,’’ said Tobias Meyer, head of contemporary art for Sotheby’s worldwide. “He was one of those collectors who trusted his eye and had no qualms about what he bought.’’The most important works he collected were contemporary, to be sold the evening of Nov. 14. By far the star of the group, which includes works by Damien Hirst, Lichtenstein, Basquiat, Gerhard Richter and Carl Andre, is a 1968 Francis Bacon, “Version No. 2 of Lying Figure With Hypodermic Syringe,’’ in which Bacon took one of the most familiar subjects in art — the reclining female nude — and painted it as a tortured soul, as he often did. It is expected to sell for $9 million to $12 million.On Tuesday five eight-foot-tall photographic portraits of men and women who immigrated to New York from around the world appeared in Madison Square Park. While the faces may not be recognized by the public, the imposing style of the images is unmistakably the work of Chuck Close.The photographs, on view until Nov. 10, are part of a three-city exhibition of public art commissioned by United Technologies Corporation, the Hartford-based company that makes aircraft engines and elevators. Organized by Gabriella De Ferrari, a curator and consultant to United Technologies, the exhibition is called “Cities in Transition.’’ Ms. De Ferrari commissioned three artists to do projects in three cities — Mr. Close for New York, the photographer and filmmaker Mitch Epstein for Boston, and the photographer Dayanita Singh for Hartford — based on the evolution of urban America.Mr. Epstein has placed 15 images that he said responded to today’s urban priorities — comfort, privacy and speed — along the tracks on each of the platforms of the Downtown Crossing subway station in Boston, where they will be on view through Oct. 29. Ms. Singh has created for Bushnell Park in Hartford a series of photographs showing an urban landscape without people, a comment on that city’s struggle to rejuvenate itself. They can be seen until Nov. 10.Mr. Close, who said he was “not a big fan of public art,’’ agreed to do the project “because it is temporary, and if you hate it will be gone pretty soon.’’ The theme intrigued him. “I started thinking about New York and how it’s bounced back since 9/11,’’ he said. “New York is a city in constant flux, with an immigrant population that brings a rich smorgasbord of cultures and traditions.’’ So he photographed people he knew who had all immigrated to New York. Usually people photographed for billboards are celebrities, but Mr. Close said he liked the fact that these, mostly young artists, were not known — yet.'"
"'06-09-22,'0','UNITED NATIONS, Sept. 21 — Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, the Iranian president, refused to say Thursday whether he would comply with a Security Council demand for the disarmament and disbanding of Hezbollah, the Tehran-backed guerrilla group that fought a 34-day war with Israel.“I’d like to say that Lebanon’s affairs are its own affairs, and we don’t want to interfere,” he said, when asked about the resolution that ended the combat in Lebanon last month.He was also evasive about whether Iran would comply with the resolution’s call for an arms embargo to keep Hezbollah from rearming.He said that the United Nations Charter gave people the right to defend themselves and that “we give spiritual support to all those who want to uphold their rights.”Mr. Ahmadinejad spoke at a wide-ranging news conference in a packed United Nations conference hall in which he also reiterated Iran’s denial that it was pursuing a nuclear weapon and chastised Western countries for trying to curb Iran’s right to pursue nuclear energy. “Iran considers the nuclear issue a political one,” he said. “They’re not concerned about the bomb, they want to stop the development of our country.”'"
"'06-09-22,'0','Hubert Schulenberg, a 60-year-old salvage dealer from Cross Plains, Wis., retired as a driver five years ago but still plans to attend Oktoberfest for the 30th time with his wife, Paulette. They will sleep in a camper on the fairgrounds.“They have just about every class of racing you can possibly think of,” he said.The fields at these events are enormous, and the racing is nonstop, with one heat usually following another. There is a lot of racing to squeeze into a weekend.At Thompson International Speedway in Thompson, Conn., in mid-October, between 550 and 600 cars are expected to compete in 14 divisions. Cars that do not meet the track’s rules are grouped in what is called an “outlaws” division, with weight added to some to ensure closer racing.“It’s a huge party for race fans,” said Russ Dowd, the director of operations at Thompson.Low admission fees are another lure: a single-day ticket at Oktoberfest, for example, is $15 to $25 for adults and $4 to $5 a child.Racing in several different classifications, including the late-model stock cars and sleek, angular modified racers, is the focal point, but the events have also become gathering places for those who hate to see winter coming.“I think it’s a mixture of a county fair, a family reunion and a picnic,” said Chuck Deery, the general manager at LaCrosse Speedway.Mr. Morton at Wall Township Speedway said that for racers, these celebrations are steppingstones for the next year. The racing is fierce, with cars side by side on the tracks and constant lead changes. There is often much more action on a short track than in a Nextel Cup race.Lee USA Speedway in Lee, N.H., is about 30 miles from New Hampshire International Speedway, a one-mile track in Loudon, N.H., that plays host to two Nextel Cup races every year. More than 100,000 attended the Nextel Cup races, but the races at Lee USA have their own appeal. “It’s etched in stone,’’ said Judy MacDonald, the sales manager at Lee USA. “It’s just part of what you do.’’Because the Turkey Derby at Wall Speedway is held after the Nextel Cup season, a few stock-car big boys, who never seem to get enough speed, will join in; Ken Schrader, a Nextel Cup veteran, plans to race in two divisions this year.For young drivers, there’s an opportunity to gain recognition. An 18-year-old local hotshot named Martin Truex Jr. won a modified-class event at the Turkey Derby in 1998. Mr. Truex is now Dale Earnhardt Jr.’s teammate in the Nextel Cup series.Mostly, the fields are filled with cars driven by racers from nearby who just want to take a few final hot laps before stashing their cars in garages for the winter. The purses usually offer only enough to defray costs. But that, apparently, is enough.“If you go for the money, you’re not going to make anything out of it,” Mr. Schulenberg said. “You go for the sport.”'"

"'06-09-23,'0','MOSCOW, Sept. 22 — The United States Davis Cup team ended up with what may be an insurmountable deficit Friday after the first day of play in the semifinals, losing both singles matches against Russia.Andy Roddick lost in straight sets to Marat Safin, 6-4, 6-3, 7-6 (5), and James Blake lost to Mikhail Youzhny, 7-5, 1-6, 6-1, 6-4. So after just two matches, the United States team’s hopes of winning its first Davis Cup since 1995 were bleak.To advance to the final, the United States will need Mike and Bob Bryan to win their doubles match Saturday and then have Roddick and Blake win the reverse singles matches Sunday. And they will have to do this on clay, a surface that does not play to the strengths of the Americans.Patrick McEnroe, the team’s captain, said his players showed good enough form to “give us a chance if we get to Sunday.”There were moments Friday when Roddick and Blake looked promising, but those moments did not last long enough.Roddick worked his way back from being down by 5-3 in the third set before losing. “We know each other pretty well,” Safin said. “I know he’s not confident on clay. It would have been different on a hard court.”'"

In exchange, the government said taxpayers would be able to direct a larger portion of their taxes each year to the church.

"'06-09-23,'0','ALBANY, Sept. 22 — As several Democrats and civic groups called Friday for an investigation into whether John Faso, the Republican nominee for governor, should have registered as a lobbyist for some work he performed last year, an official at the state’s lobbying commission suggested that an inquiry could already be under way.The calls to investigate Mr. Faso came after The New York Times reported on Friday that Mr. Faso had been in constant contact with the governor’s office trying to obtain legislation last year when he was hired as a lawyer for the Public Asset Fund, a state entity charged with selling billions of dollars of state-owned stock. Mr. Faso argued that the fund was simply an arm of government, so he did not have to register as a lobbyist.“It is so clearly not a subject of the lobbying law as to be laughable,” Mr. Faso said on Friday.But several groups called on Friday for an investigation by the lobbying commission, including Common Cause/NY and Assemblyman Alexander B. Grannis, a Manhattan Democrat who is chairman of the Assembly’s Insurance Committee.The executive director of the state’s lobbying commission, David M. Grandeau, suggested that such an investigation might already be under way. Asked about the case, he said, “We don’t comment on pending investigations.’’Asked if he could comment if there were no investigation, he said, “Absolutely.’’He then declined to elaborate on the case.'"
"'06-09-23,'0','Dean E. Wooldridge, a crucial figure in the development of the technology of nuclear warfare in the 1950’s, died Wednesday at a hospital in Santa Barbara, Calif., his hometown. He was 93.The cause was pneumonia, his son James said.Dr. Wooldridge was the “W” in TRW, one of the biggest military contractors of the last half century. The company merged with Northrop Grumman in 2002, creating the nation’s second-largest military contractor, after Lockheed Martin.With his colleague Simon Ramo, Dr. Wooldridge was a leading systems engineer in the development of intercontinental ballistic missiles — the backbone of American nuclear strategy during the cold war. After World War II, when the Air Force became a separate entity from what had been the Army Air Corps, the foremost questions confronting the military involved how to protect the United States from a nuclear attack by the Soviet Union, and how, if necessary, to pursue a nuclear war.Dr. Wooldridge and Dr. Ramo, who had been classmates at the California Institute of Technology, formed the Ramo-Wooldridge Corporation in 1953. A year later, President Dwight D. Eisenhower asked James R. Killian, the president of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and a panel of experts outside the government to assess the nuclear vulnerability of the United States. Their secret report, submitted in 1955, advised the nation to expedite its development of intercontinental ballistic missiles.That gave Ramo-Wooldridge a huge increase in government funds and political momentum. The company had already received the Pentagon’s contract to be the technical director of the missile program.'"
"'06-09-23,'0','“They’d have to keep falling and the decline would have to last for at least three or four months before it would have much of an impact on anything,” said Sean McAlinden, chief economist at the Center for Automotive Research in Ann Arbor, Mich.“It would take a real fall to the $1.50 level to start changing expectations,” he explained. “And there’s a better chance of $4 than $1.50 in the long run.”The problem is consumers may have decided that higher gas prices are more the rule, and any drops they might see in coming months or years are the exception.Detroit car companies continue to rely on big vehicles as the most important part of their lineups. Those products were planned years ago, when $3-a-gallon-gas still seemed unthinkable.In August, a survey by Consumer Reports magazine found that fuel economy had become the top consideration for car shoppers, ahead of reliability, price and safety. Many of the people who feel that way have turned to Japanese manufacturers, namely Toyota and Honda, which spent decades honing their reputations for producing high-quality fuel-efficient vehicles.In 2002, the year S.U.V. sales peaked, only 22.7 percent of likely buyers said fuel economy was important in considering which car to buy, according to CNW Marketing Research, a firm in Bandon, Ore., that studies buying habits.By 2005, 61.3 percent of buyers rated fuel economy as important. And in the first quarter of this year, after Hurricane Katrina but before gas prices spiked again, that figured climbed to 64 percent, CNW research showed.Sales of S.U.V.’s, a market long dominated by Detroit, have plunged 18 percent this year through August, after a 15 percent drop last year, industry statistics show. That compares with single-digit declines in 2003 and 2004, when gas cost less than $2.None of the 15 top-selling vehicles in August were traditional S.U.V.’s. Sales of the Ford Explorer, the most popular S.U.V. for years, are about one-third lower than last year.Last year was the first time drivers in most of the country paid $3 a gallon, after Katrina, although drivers in California have seen prices rise above $3 a gallon routinely this decade.But this year prices surged again, with no hurricane to blame, and Detroit realized its days of raking in handsome profits on sales of S.U.V.’s alone were not coming back.“There’s a new reality,” said Ford Motor Company’s chief sales analyst, George Pipas, acknowledging that the company no longer expects a rebound in the S.U.V. market. At this point, Mr. Pipas said, he can only hope that gas prices stay low enough for long enough to stop light truck sales from dropping too quickly.“If gas prices were to stabilize at today’s levels, I think we might see a return to the slower declines that we experienced in ’03 and ’04,” he said. “We still see this category declining further, regardless of what happens to energy prices. We happen to think that demographics are the primary driver of this shift, as baby boomers downsize, but that gas prices speeded it up.”As of Friday, a gallon of regular unleaded gas cost an average of $2.44 nationwide, according to the AAA motor club. That is 47 cents less than a month ago — yet still high by historical standards.The respite comes as General Motors prepares to begin selling its new line of full-size pickups, a vehicle seen as key to returning the company to profitability. G.M. also redesigned its large S.U.V.’s earlier this year and needs to continue selling them at a steady pace to keep its turnaround plans on track.Ford is bringing out fresh versions of the Ford Explorer and Lincoln Navigator, once so popular Ford could not keep them in stock. But their sales have plummeted this year. Ford is putting its emphasis this fall, however, on its new crossover, the Edge.The Chrysler Group, which is more dependent on truck sales than any of its competitors, has experienced a sudden sales slump and expects to lose $1.5 billion this quarter, more than double its original projections. Chrysler has a bevy of upcoming new vehicles, but it has struggled to unload excess inventories of 2006 models that are clogging dealer lots.Neither company is counting on falling gas prices to provide much of a boost. If anything, consumer confidence may increase slightly, which all industries would welcome. But economists do not expect many people to put money saved on fuel toward a new vehicle, if they were not already shopping for one.“I don’t think anybody’s paid a whole lot of attention to it,” said a G.M. spokesman, John M. McDonald.“It’s way too early to tell,” said Kevin McCormick, a Chrysler spokesman. “We don’t know how long these lower prices are going to sustain.”Chrysler’s chief executive, Thomas W. LaSorda, last month said the company was planning for gas prices to remain in the $3 to $4 range for the rest of this decade. On a conference call this week, Mr. LaSorda said there had been no uptick in sales as a result of reduced gas prices.Mr. McAlinden said the automakers are wise to dismiss the recent drop-off and focus on improving their offerings of smaller cars with higher gas mileage.“The executives in Detroit — finally — don’t trust this decline in gasoline at all,” he said. “Any foreign event could put us back at $3 a gallon, and I think the public senses that.”'"
"'06-09-23,'0','NEW HAVEN, Sept. 22 (AP) — A giant liquefied natural gas terminal proposed for Long Island Sound poses safety and security risks that would require more firefighters, escort boats and other measures to prevent accidents or terrorist attacks, according to a Coast Guard report released Friday.The Coast Guard issued a security analysis that does not take a position on the proposal by Broadwater Energy, but concludes that additional measures would be needed to “responsibly manage risks to navigation safety and security risks” associated with the project.Broadwater, a partnership of Shell Oil and the TransCanada Corporation based in Calgary, Alberta, wants to build a terminal about the size of the Queen Mary 2 that would float about 9 miles from Wading River, on Long Island, and 11 miles from New Haven. It would supply one billion cubic feet of natural gas a day, enough to heat four million homes a year.Environmentalists oppose the application, and some public officials worry that the $700 million terminal would be too dangerous for the busy waterway.Natural gas is cooled and condensed into a liquid to make transportation easier. Under the Broadwater proposal, the terminal would receive liquid shipments by boat, then pump the gas into an existing pipeline between Long Island and Connecticut.'"
"'06-09-23,'0','Statistics on domestic crude oil inventories will be released on Wednesday, and could shake up markets even further.RATE FREEZE In a split decision, the Federal Reserve’s policy makers voted to keep interest rates unchanged, spotlighting the housing slowdown and suggesting that accelerating inflation, while still a threat, seems less likely than in the past.In effect, the Fed affirmed its assertion that the slowing economy will curb the rate of price increases, which has been near the top of its target range.While many recent economic statistics, measuring the housing industry, labor market, factory orders and other bellwethers, have shown weakness, which should ease pressure on prices, others have remained strong. Economists point to labor costs, which are rising faster than productivity for the first time in many years.Additional evidence of the state of the economy will come next week, when measures of consumer confidence, orders for durable goods and second-quarter economic output are released.CHRYSLER CUTS Warning that it expects to lose $1.26 billion this year, the Chrysler Group, a unit of DaimlerChrysler, said it would cut production in the second half of this year by 16 percent, or about 90,000 vehicles.Slumping sales of sport utility vehicles are driving the cutback, said the company, which recently said it did not see how to profitably produce economy cars in the United States. Chrysler said it would again ask the United Automobile Workers union to agree to reduce health care benefits, though the union rejected the idea earlier this month.Chrysler’s chief executive, Thomas M. LaSorda, said he was planning another restructuring — the company’s second in six years — but said it was too early to discuss plant closings. He did say, however, that Chrysler needed to act quickly.General Motors and Ford have already reached agreements with the U.A.W. to buy out tens of thousands of hourly employees.Automakers will release car sales data for September on Oct. 1.OIL LEASE CHARGES In lawsuits unsealed by a federal judge, four government auditors say the Interior Department suppressed their attempts to recover more than $30 million from energy companies that they said were cheating the government out of royalties for oil from publicly owned waters in the Gulf of Mexico.The accusations surfaced a week after the Interior Department’s inspector general, Earl E. Devaney, told a House subcommittee that “short of crime, anything goes” at the top levels of the Interior Department.The auditors sued the oil companies under the False Claims Act, a federal law that governs individuals who expose fraud against the government. People who recover money for the government in such cases are entitled to share in the amount recouped.Interior officials denied that the agency had suppressed any valid claims and implied that the auditors sued rather than worked within the system because they wanted a share of any money recovered through their lawsuits.With midterm elections six weeks away, Democrats and Republicans in Congress are expected to question the Bush administration’s willingness to challenge the oil and gas industry.SILICON SCANDAL Hewlett-Packard’s beleaguered chairwoman, Patricia R. Dunn, resigned from the board as the company’s spying scandal showed no sign of dying down.The good news for H.P., such as it was, was that the California attorney general did not press criminal charges against the company, its officers or contractors, as he had said he expected to do.The bad news was that new revelations about the program seemed to emerge every day, with each expanding the depth and breadth of the possibly illegal campaign.In one example, The New York Times reported that Hewlett-Packard studied the idea of planting spies in news organizations as part of its investigation of leaks from its board. The company has already acknowledged that private investigators working for it had misrepresented themselves to obtain private phone records.A House subcommittee has scheduled hearings on Hewlett-Packard next Thursday.'"
"'06-09-23,'0','Concertgoers who headed to Alice Tully Hall on Thursday evening for the season-opening concert by the Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center could have been forgiven for walking right past the place.A makeshift wall of painted planks surrounds what was the courtyard in front of the main entrance to Tully Hall on Broadway, at 65th Street. The process of turning 65th Street into an inviting promenade, the first stage of the overall redevelopment of the Lincoln Center campus, is well under way. Patrons of Tully Hall must now enter from a new side entrance on 65th Street, which takes them into a remodeled, somewhat smaller but quite commodious lobby.In any event, this was a big night for the society, the opening of its 39th season, the first planned by the new artistic directors, the pianist Wu Han and the cellist David Finckel. These dynamic musicians, who are married, have exuded confidence about taking over a venerable but stodgy-seeming institution. They have devised intriguing themes for programs this season. The gala was a kind of sampler, with 10 diverse works played by a total of 21 musicians.A performance of Dvorak’s String Quintet in E flat (Op. 97), which ended this long program, already showed the wisdom of one of Ms. Wu and Mr. Finckel’s ideas. The society has long fielded a roster of core artists, as well as a secondary roster of younger artists, called Chamber Music Society Two. The new directors believe that exciting performances will result by bringing the veteran and younger artists together. For this performance three younger musicians (the violinists Erin Keefe and Lily Francis and the violist Beth Guterman) joined two member artists (the violist Paul Neubauer and Mr. Finckel, on cello).The hope was that the young musicians would galvanize the playing with their freshness, and the veterans would bring enriching experience to bear, which both proved true in this incisive and engaging performance. For all the high spirits, the players tapped into the wistfulness that lies below the surface of this genial music.Still, if Dvorak had actually counted the number of times he repeats the catchy theme of the jaunty finale, might he have cut a few minutes?'"
"'06-09-23,'0','Berlin has a deserved reputation as a, or the, new world center for all things young and hip. Anyone wishing to test that proposition need look no further than Dance Theater Workshop, where on Thursday a piece called “Back to the Present,” by the Berlin-based group Constanza Macras/Dorky Park, was happily ensconced. Theater Heute, a leading German theater magazine, wrote that the piece reflected “exactly the scene of Berlin bohemia.” That seems about right.Ms. Macras comes from Buenos Aires and was trained, among other places, in New York. In 1995 she gravitated to Berlin, like the 12 dancers in her wildly international company. That company, named to recall Gorky Park (the Moscow park and/or rock band) but also to sound dorky, was founded in 2003. Before that she had another group, Tamagotchi Y2K, and she has worked extensively with the various Berlin theaters that subsidize dance.Dorky Park’s first show was a nearly four-hour version of “Back to the Present,” performed in a rambling, derelict Berlin department store. The piece was retooled for the stage in 2004 and lasts two and a half hours (with one intermission) at Dance Theater Workshop. The three performances here are part of the citywide European Dream festival.At first glance this might seem like another of those endlessly proliferating post-Pina Bausch exercises in random vignettes, some dance and some theater (and here, some video) performed by a personable young cast. This kind of work can seem charming but also inconclusive.What distinguishes “Back to the Present,” apart from a particularly personable, sexy cast, is the manic good humor of the entire enterprise. The piece ends with a crazed free-for-all, with everyone stripping (or being stripped) naked and hundreds of stuffed animals and other detritus hurled around the set. It’s just exhilarating.Everything before that leads up to the end. At the outset a woman intones a mantra: “We dance and we love; we love and we dance.” And they do dance, intermittently, with considerable skill. But there are also all manner of vignettes, often sexy or sexual or barely clothed.'"

"'06-09-23,'0','He is also a therapy dog now, visiting homes for the elderly at least once a month, and has recently become a symbol to New Jersey residents battling a law in Englewood that bans bull terriers and some other breeds. After a four-year career in which he competed in 300 or so dog shows, often staying in less-than-luxurious motels, this is a piece of cake.Every potential champion has to work his or her way up, often by participating in a hundred or more shows a year. Some of those competitions are for specific breeds; others are for one and all. A dog receives points for winning each show. Qualifying to be one of the American Kennel Club champions competing at Westminster involves a complicated set of rules, but it begins with the top five dogs in each breed, based on points.IN the grooming tent there was frantic activity. A luxuriously silky 2-year-old cocker spaniel was being prepared for the next round of competition. Old English sheepdogs were in various stages of encounters with powerful hair dryers. This sort of cosmetic attention is an easy target for humor, but as Chris Reid pointed out, dog shows are all about business.“We’re here to show off our breeding stock,” said Ms. Reid, a breeder of cairn terriers from North Carolina. Championship status can mean higher prices for puppies. As Ms. Reid’s presence indicated, the shows are not strictly local anymore. “We have people here from Canada, California, North and South Dakota,” she said. “If we like the judges, we will go to the ends of the earth.”The two judges I happened to meet were from Santa Ana, Calif. (Joe C. Walton), and Narragansett, R.I. (Dr. Robert A. Indeglia, who will choose the big winner at Westminster next year). Dr. Indeglia, 68, has been judging dog shows for 34 years. He does 40 to 50 events a year and still maintains a cardiothoracic surgery practice in Providence. Mr. Walton, 65, a retired teacher, has a similar schedule and similar longevity in the field. Last year he judged shows as far away as Sweden and Shanghai.As most judges will tell you, they follow no exact formula. Looks count, beginning with the specific physical standard for each breed. But they count more for lap dog breeds like Cavalier King Charles spaniels than movement around the ring does. On the other hand, for herding dogs, movement is pretty much everything.The worst thing that can happen to a contestant is not, as one might think, relieving itself at the wrong time. In fact, a fluffy bichon frisé came in third in its group at Westchester despite having defecated at the edge of the ring.Lisa Peterson, the A.K.C.’s director of club communications, suggested that the biggest faux pas (or faux paw) is a dog’s moving when it is supposed to be still. David Frei, who announces the Westchester show, as well as the Westminster at Madison Square Garden, remembered such a case. “It happened at Westminster this year,” he said. “When the judge walked up to the pug who had won the toy group, the dog pulled away from the judge.”In the big time, that’s the end of the road.GENERAL dog shows begin with animals competing within their own breeds. Those winners go up against other breeds with the same general job description (herders, hounds and so on) in the group competitions. The group winners vie with one another for the top prize: best in show.Before the group competitions at Westchester could begin, the traditional “chuck a duck” contest had to be held: For $5, a participant could throw a small rubber ducky in the general direction of a fake pond on the lawn. Duck No. 59 landed closest to the target’s center, winning half of the $500 prize. The other half went to Take the Lead, a charity that supports people in the dog show world who have devastating illnesses.The show was becoming more focused now, with breed winners all gathering in the central ring for the seven group competitions. The audience, much smaller now that many nonwinning dogs’ entourages had gone home, dragged their folding chairs to the new spot, separated from the stars only by a low white picket fence. Much of the time, the animals garnered polite applause, but supporters occasionally piped up with hoots and shouts.As Mr. Frei began announcing the terrier group in a low, mellifluous voice, Christopher Guest’s 2000 film comedy “Best in Show” came to mind. The movie painted a picture of human dog show participants as eccentric, to say the least. “All of us in the dog show world liked it, because we recognized all the characters,” Mr. Frei said of the movie. “We are a character-rich environment.” Those characters may be breeders, owners, judges, groomers or handlers.Handlers are the supporting casts of dog shows, though some (like Peter Green, Bill McFadden, Clay Coady, Clint Livingston, and Michelle and Michael Scott) become stars. Some handlers are owners, others are breeders, and others do it for a living. Some have had formal training; others have learned from mentors.There were a few standouts at Westchester. A young blond woman with movie-star looks led the breed-winning Samoyed around the ring. An older woman wore a picture hat with a big yellow rose, a purple dress and sneakers as she escorted a dignified borzoi (defying Mr. Frei’s advice: “The best handlers are invisible”).Hana Katz of West Hartford, Conn., was pretty in a pink Jackie Kennedy-style suit as she put the breed-winning standard poodle through its paces (Ms. Katz is 12 and has already been doing this sort of thing for two years). And for some reason, the herding group brought out an unusual number of attractive male handlers.The show world is made up mostly of “everyday people who have families and day jobs,” said the A.K.C.’s Ms. Peterson.This is not a hobby of the rich, but there are expenses, starting with an estimated base rate of $50 to $100 per show for the handler (plus bonuses if the dog wins). Grooming can add another $50 to $100, which may explain why there are a number of owner-handler-groomers around. Travel expenses can mount, and current gas prices aren’t exactly encouraging lengthy car trips.Surrounded by experts, I soon learned that Jack Russell terriers are now called Parson Russells and how to tell the difference between Norfolk and Norwich terriers (Norfolks have floppy ears and Norwiches have pointed ones).A stately Airedale won the terrier group. Anne Elser of Greenwich, Conn., the co-owner of a West Highland white terrier that lost, and Jane Sajban of West Milford, N.J., its handler, did not seem discouraged. Their Westie, Dawn’s Make’n Waves, had won for its breed, its second victory of the week. And Westchester is a prestige win.“They call them the three W’s — Westminster, Westchester and Westbury,” Ms. Sajban said, referring to Westbury, on Long Island, which is to be held Oct. 1. Ms. Sajban, 46, a part-time hairdresser and dog groomer who has been a handler for 13 years, participates in shows almost every weekend, she said, some as far afield as Illinois and Kentucky, but she particularly likes Westchester’s “tristate ambience.”Like Ms. Sajban, many on the dog show circuit acknowledge that consistency in results is not always the rule.“It’s happened to all of us, to win best in show one day and lose the breed the next,” said Mr. Walton, who had judged a dozen terrier breeds earlier in the day and was judging the hound group later.AS the group competitions continued, the sun went in and out. A gorgeous Komondor (one of the breeds that look like big, walking rag mops) won in the working group. The toy group included the newly fashionable Havanese (Barbara Walters’s Cha-Cha, who was not spotted at the show, is one). The toy poodle, clipped to within a quarter-inch of its canine life, was an audience favorite. But the winner was a deserving little affenpinscher, who appeared to jump for joy when he got the news.In the hound group, the Petit Basset Griffon Vendéen, a k a the PBGV, grabbed attention by howling as it began its trip around the ring, but the American foxhound won. The nonsporting group included some fairly unfamiliar breeds, among them the schipperke and the shiba inu, but the familiar Dalmatian won. The Old English sheepdog won the herding group. The English springer spaniel beat all the retrievers, setters and other spaniels in the sporting group.The day seemed to be winding down, with most vendors gone and the children in the audience becoming restless. Soon a true hush came over the crowd. The seven group winners were presented and, in what felt like an anticlimax (like the always rushed best picture announcement at the end of the Oscars), the English springer spaniel, Ch. Felicity’s Diamond Jim, a k a James, was named best in show. As the spectators drifted home, the dog posed with its trophy and beaming humans for photographers.James is a 6½-year-old from Fairfax Station, Va., who has won 40 best-in-show titles in less than two years, though he is a relative stay-at-home. “I don’t believe in flying him everywhere every weekend,” said Teresa Patton, one of his owners. And Ms. Patton, 56, a former teacher who now owns a dog training school, cannot always accompany him when he does travel. In fact, she said, “I have never seen my dog go best in show.”'"
"'06-09-23,'0','The officials who solemnly sit in judgment as show dogs strut, weave and occasionally fumble in the ring have, for many years, been judged themselves.Each must have at least 10 years’ experience as an owner, breeder and exhibitor and must pass a written test on his or her chosen breed and an open-book test on American Kennel Club rules and procedures, as well as sit for an oral interview. Each must also complete a practice round of five judging assignments in the breed. Group judges must be qualified in all breeds in a group, and best-in-show judges must be qualified in at least one of the seven groups and have judged that group at least five times. The process can take years of watching dogs and slowly developing a sure eye.“When you officiate in the ring, you are putting every single dog against your mind’s picture of the perfect dog, and then you are weighing the pluses and minuses,” said Sari Brewster Tietjen, who was the best-in-show judge at the Westchester Kennel Club All-Breed Dog Show on Sept. 10.Friendships and favors have the potential to play a part in a judge’s ruling, Mrs. Tietjen said. But Tom Bradley, the show chairman at the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show and a veteran judge, said the better judges leave all of that ringside.“Every judge does it a little bit differently,” he said, noting that the quick decisions in the ring come mainly from first impressions. “In essence, you can eliminate, let’s say, a third of a big class pretty easily, but you try not to show that in your expression.”Mr. Bradley said that his family has criticized him for not smiling during shows. “When a better judge goes into the ring, the people become invisible,” he said. “I’m not there to smile. I’m there to compare Dog A to Dog B to Dog C to the standard.”The financial rewards are minor: travel expenses and a set fee, which rarely tops a few hundred dollars a day. “I judge because I love dogs,” Mrs. Tietjen said. “I can’t own them all, and I wouldn’t want to own them all, but I love to get my hands on them.”'"
"'06-09-23,'0','There are only six works by the Long Island sculptor Arden Scott in the current show at Dowling College in Oakdale: four free-standing metal sculptures and a pair of mobiles made of bamboo, cloth, resin and other materials. But that is more than enough to make a formidable exhibition, for some of the pieces are quite large, and each has its own discrete beauty and charm.Originally from New York City, Ms. Scott moved 25 years ago to Greenport, a once-sleepy North Fork fishing village that is gradually being overrun by affluent Manhattanites.Her environment provides much of the inspiration for her artwork, which most recently has centered on the creation of elegantly simplified sculptures of boats, canoes and other pleasure craft. These are what have been assembled here.Ms. Scott’s free-standing metal sculptures, all dating from the last decade or so, are the stronger works in the exhibition, which is at the college’s Anthony Giordano Gallery. They are archetypal forms, little more than riblike frames that remind you of the skeletal remains of ancient sailing vessels recovered during archeological excavation. Even the titles evoke the misty-eyed Romanticism of the past. They have an undeniable nostalgia.The most intriguing offering is “Infinite Pacifics” (2003), a canoelike structure 21 feet long made of narrow strips of welded bronze, lead and stones. Though its presence in the gallery is redoubtable, it has a quiet weightlessness, the work seeming to float on the floor. How does she achieve that quality?'"
"'06-09-23,'0','“This doesn’t have to do with a particular person, however,” he added. “It’s an abstract question. One could also ask: can Germany have a female chancellor? We’ve seen that, yes, we can.”The election of Angela Merkel, a brainy physicist-turned-politician from eastern Germany, has scrambled the assumptions about what is possible in German politics. While Mr. Wowereit deflects speculation about succeeding her, he is one of the few politicians in the country with real momentum. And his more sober demeanor is a sign of his national ambitions.“I believe I have support nationally because of my policies,” Mr. Wowereit said, noting that Berlin, with its aging population and fraying social safety net, is a microcosm of Germany as a whole.Still, he acknowledges the obvious complications. While being openly gay may seem almost bourgeois in hip, anything-goes Berlin, it is viewed differently in a small village in Bavaria.“The mere fact that we’re talking about it shows that it is still an issue,” said Mr. Wowereit, who disclosed his homosexuality in 2001 with the now-famous line, “I’m gay, and it’s good that way.”It has certainly been good for him here, where he has become a cuddly symbol of Berlin’s openness and tolerance. When he took the stage to thank supporters from his Social Democratic Party on Sunday, he hugged his companion, Jörn Kubicki, a neurosurgeon 12 years his junior, saying, “Anyone who knows me knows that he hasn’t had it easy with me.”At a time when German politicians are dodging difficult issues like health care reform, such forthrightness is appealing. In this often cranky city, two-thirds of the people approve of his job performance.THE mayor’s popularity is even more remarkable given that Berlin is in many ways a shambles. It has a 17 percent unemployment rate — well above the national average — $77 billion in debt and an economy that has not grown in a decade. The last big private company with headquarters here, the drug maker Schering, was recently taken over by a rival in the Rhine Valley.Mr. Wowereit, a lawyer who came to power in 2001 after a financial scandal, tried to stem Berlin’s red ink by trimming housing subsidies and the wages of government workers. But he barely made a dent, and the city has appealed to Germany’s highest court to force the federal government to bail it out.Admirers note that Mr. Wowereit has been able to work in a coalition with the Party of Democratic Socialism, the old East German Communist Party, though he is now weighing whether to jilt it in favor of the Greens.He also bucked local resistance to break ground earlier this month on a new international airport in Schönefeld, south of Berlin. The project, which Mr. Wowereit described as the major achievement of his first term, will generate 7,200 construction jobs a year between now and 2012.Mr. Wowereit’s critics say he is a lightweight who has avoided tough choices. Even those sympathetic to him are hard pressed to point to a big idea, beyond the airport, that he has championed.Berlin, he concedes, will never be able to attract the huge investments that would return it to its glory days between the world wars.“The banks aren’t coming from Frankfurt,” Mr. Wowereit said. “They’re going to London. Volkswagen is not going to build a factory here. They’re building new factories in Eastern Europe or Asia.”The only solution, he said, is for Berlin to play to its strengths as a swinging town, a magnet for culture and tourism. “This is the place to be at the moment, even more than London,” he said.There are apparently very few visitors Mr. Wowereit would turn away: for the past two years, he has signed an official welcome message for a gathering of fetishists — a practice that prompted conservative politicians to accuse him of contributing to “moral degeneration.”“We are poor but sexy,” Mr. Wowereit said in 2003, using another line that has become an unofficial slogan for Berlin. These days, he amends that, saying, “I’d rather be rich and sexy than poor and sexy.”Part of the mayor’s appeal is that Berliners view him as a native son. Born in the working-class Tempelhof district to a single mother with five children, Mr. Wowereit was the first person in his family to go to college. He studied law and once dreamed of becoming a judge.BUT after joining the Social Democrats, Mr. Wowereit burrowed into municipal politics. In 1984, he became the youngest member of Berlin’s city council. His hero is Willy Brandt, a mayor of West Berlin who later became chancellor and forged historic ties to East Germany in the 1970’s.Mr. Wowereit’s party-hearty image is a source of some amusement to people who have known him for a long time.“He used to never go to the parties,” said Michael S. Cullen, an American historian who has lived in Berlin since 1964 and advises the government on cultural affairs. “In 1995 and 1996, he was studying the Berlin budget day and night. He knew every line item.”The mayor, Mr. Cullen suggests, became more extroverted after he disclosed his sexual orientation.For his part, Mr. Wowereit said his busy social schedule consists mostly of promotional work on behalf of Berlin. His man-about-town image, he said, is largely a creation of the news media, and was exploited during the election by the Christian Democrats, in their fruitless effort to unseat him.If he were not mayor, Mr. Wowereit said, his idea of a perfect Saturday night would be to stay home and read a book or watch television. At most, he might join a small group of friends for dinner.“I’m 53 next month, and it’s not my thing to go to clubs and dance through the whole night,” he said in September. “That time is a little bit over.”'"
"'06-09-23,'0','Everett McKinley Dirksen, the Senate Republican leader in the 1950’s, is supposed to have said, “A billion here and a billion there, and pretty soon you’re talking real money.” What would he have thought of derivatives today?The International Swaps and Derivatives Association, a trade group, reported this week that the outstanding nominal value of swaps and derivatives at the end of June was $283.2 trillion.Compare that with the combined gross domestic product of the United States, the European Union, Canada, Japan and China, which is about $34 trillion. The total value of all homes in the United States is about the same amount.To be sure, notional value is an exaggerated term as it greatly overstates the amount at risk in many contracts. But the growth rate is real, and in the fastest-growing area of swaps — credit default swaps — notional value is closer to the amount at risk, because such swaps promise to make up the losses if a borrower defaults on the notional amount.The value of outstanding credit default swaps doubles every year — a trend that must eventually stop — and now equals $26 trillion. That is about the same as the total amount of bond debt in the United States, and corporate debt, on which most credit swaps are traded, comes to just $5.2 trillion.'"

"'06-09-24,'0','She said, Florette was in good health, strong as an ox despite her filthy cigarette habit. Her ankle fracture was very serious and naturally there was hypothermia due to the cold. The cut at her throat was not deep and there was very little bleeding because her body was so cold. Her blood was beginning to congeal. Strong as she was, all this was too much for her. When she was cut her heart stopped. I am certain she was unconscious so at the end the cold would not have mattered to her. I'm bound to say that one hour would have made the difference but I'm sure you and your friends did the best you could under the circumstances. She had a bad time of it, I'm afraid.It's a blessing that at the end she was surely unconscious. The cold, her injuries. She had tremendous faith, as you know, and her faith would have helped her through her ordeal. Still, the experience would have been very lonely for her and frightening. Is it true there were four men? Whoever they were, they deserve to rot in hell.I'm sure they will.Poor Florette. It's not the first time something of this sort has happened, men from outside the region, poaching, smuggling, running guns or drugs or just running away.These mountains-the doctor began but did not finish her thought. Instead, she shrugged and walked away.He wondered what Dr. Picot wanted to tell him about the mountains. Probably she had an urge to explain the local superstitions but thought better of it. So he was left with Florette's urn in his arms, imagining her blood going cold as her heart failed. The other details he put at the back of his mind.Thomas watched the doctor make her way to her car, head down, moving slowly. When she turned suddenly to look up at the bedroom window, he gave a little wave of his hand and knocked wood. She blew a kiss and continued on her way. The doctor was not an agreeable woman but she was a good friend to Florette; and he did not believe that one hour would have made any difference. He watched Dr. Picot's car move off, the sunlight so bright it hurt his eyes. He did not know what he would do for the remainder of the afternoon. He had thirty people in his house. They were good to come but he didn't want them there. Thomas moved the silver elephant so that it stood beside the photograph of him and Florette having their picnic in the mountains. The time was spring. She had bought cold chicken and a block of p‚tÈ and a bottle of the local rosÈ. She told risquÈ stories of village life when she was a girl, hilarious stories with the flavor of Rabelais. They were nothing like the stories of LaBarre when he was a boy. Thomas stared at the photograph and tried to remember the exact spot on the mountain where they had had their picnic but he could not; it was so long ago and all mountains looked the same when you were on them.Thomas pressed the heels of his hands on the dresser top and leaned until his forehead touched the windowpane, warm from the autumn sun. The noise downstairs continued. He did not want to face them but knew that he must for Florette's sake. He took a sip of wine from the glass on the dresser. He had forgotten it was there but almost at once he felt better, moving into some variety of equilibrium. The person he wanted with him was St. John Granger, dead now nearly one week. Granger knew how to get rid of people. He had been successfully getting rid of people for decades. Granger, master of the silent stare, connoisseur of the oblique and puzzling remark; and all the time he was laughing inside, as he said, ""where it counted."" Also, he knew what to do with himself of an afternoon. A single glass of wine at lunch, a book, a nap, tea at four o'clock, a stroll before dinner. Granger swung on a tight compass, having seen as much of the world as he cared to see. He was not tempted by pyramids or South Sea islands. He believed the world was overrated. All a man needed was his health, a comfortable house, his books, and a billiards table on which the varieties of experience were near infinite. He laced his talk with billiards expressions, angle shots, balance points, bad hits, corner hooks, feather shots, force-follows, time shots, table runs. He believed restlessness was the enemy of achievement-not that he valued achievement. Granger called himself a species of ghost and that was surely true. He cast no shadow on the earth, and an evening's conversation over the billiards table, broken as it was by interminable silences, seemed to halt time itself. Granger had had one profound experience as a young man and spent the rest of his life feeding off it, existing in a realm where experience was irrelevant. His life was a kind of force-follow, extreme overspin with a hesitation when it encountered resistance. Thomas laughed suddenly, looking at the elephants and thinking about Granger.Do you know, Granger said one night, that no American has won the world three-cushion billiards championship since 1936?No, I didn't know that.Belgians have won it twelve times. Not one American. Or Englishman either. One German.Why do you suppose that is, Granger?Granger, sighting an angle shot over his left knuckle, waited a moment before replying. Too much war experience, Thomas. Too little patience.Captain St. John Granger had been with Allenby's Third Army at La Boisselle, July 1, 1916, the worst day of the war, a German-expressionist horror from sunup to dusk. Along the salient that day there were 58,000 casualties including 20,000 dead, the numbers rounded off because no one had a precise count. Bodies disappeared, blown to pieces or lost in the mud. On July 2, Captain Granger crawled out of a hole and began walking. The battlefield was shrouded in early morning mist the color and density of pearls. The air smelled of fish. Granger glided over the scarred and barren terrain of no man's land, stepping carefully to avoid the corpses and pieces of corpses. He was bound for the British lines. No one noticed him and in his shock and confusion Granger believed he had become invisible. He had become one with the thick and swirling mist and so he continued unchallenged through the lines and the headquarters behind the lines. Aid stations gave way to hospitals that gave way to makeshift morgues. The fish smell grew stronger with each step he took. Granger walked across the hills until, that evening, he found himself in Albert, clad now in the blue work clothes of a French peasant. The day after that he was in Amiens, and that night in Paris, well turned out in a light-colored suit and a straw boater. He dined at Fouquet's and went home with a girl. The next week he was in Geneva, arranging a transfer of funds, a more complicated business than it might seem because by then he was reported missing in action and presumed dead. His brother, Adrian, worked for a bank in the City of London and so the transfer was made, but made most reluctantly because his banker brother did not believe in desertion in time of war, a scandalous affair, the coward's way out, letting down the side. Thank God our father and mother are gone, they could not have borne your disgrace. What will you do now? St. John said nothing, listening to his brother's voice as if it were a stranger's overheard in a railway car or on the street. He was neither insulted nor angry. He was certainly not chastened. He was indifferent to his brother's opinions because they were unearned. His brother had never seen a trench, an aid station, a morgue, or an armed enemy. He knew that in the end Adrian would comply, and in the end Adrian did. When St. John was told the details of the money transfer, the account numbers, and the verification procedures, he said a curt goodbye and hung up. They never spoke again.Granger liked the Swiss, who kept to themselves, and liked Geneva, which was orderly and quiet. But he hated the weather so by the end of 1916 he was in Barcelona, and the following year in M·laga, fetching up finally in the pretty Andalusian village of Arcos de la Frontera, where he rented rooms to wait out the war. He was eighteen years old but had already acquired the reclusive habits that would remain with him his entire life. He discarded his memories of the war, which were elusive and fragmentary, as if they did not belong to him but to someone else. He knew that the Somme had taken something vital from him but he did not know what it was, and when someone suggested that it was his youth, he scoffed. Youth held no interest for him and he had no wish to prolong it. Later, Granger decided that the experience had not taken something from him but had given something to him-but he didn't know what that was, either. He wondered if it was anonymity. He had no specific recollection of July 2, 1916, crawling out of a hole into a pearly landscape to begin his walk from no man's land to the British lines and beyond, the unobserved movements of a sleepwalker, and it seemed that was what he remained-unconcerned with his surroundings, one step removed, becalmed, friendless. Perhaps what he had been given was the dance, not the dancer. Ghost dance, he thought. And if he awakened suddenly? Granger knew in his heart that he would live a very long time and he had to acquire the circumspection to build a life abroad in the world. He had no desire to return to England. England was foreclosed in any case, because in England he was a dead man. His only relative was the appalling Adrian, and then, one month before the war ended, he learned that Adrian had been killed in a road accident. He saw a newspaper obituary by chance in the reading room of the British consulate at M·laga, and from it he discovered that his brother had a wife and young daughter, the wife an American from Pennsylvania. The obituary was brief but it contained this sentence: ""Adrian Granger's younger brother, St. John, posthumously received the Military Cross for heroic actions on the Somme salient, July 1, 1916.""Can you believe it? Granger said. Don't you think it's droll?The Military Cross! And I don't remember a thing. The day's a blank, except for the weather and the fish smell and the sense of inevitability. It's as if July 1 were a dream.What do you suppose I did to deserve the MC? Or didn't do.I suppose it's not wise to inquire too closely. But-what do you suppose happened to the medal?He said, I imagine it's buried with Adrian. Brother Adrian was a history buff with a particular interest in the Irish question. To which, I may add, he had no answer. I fancy the Military Cross redeemed me in Adrian's eyes. Do you suppose he was just the slightest bit tempted to tell them I was alive after all and on the run in Europe and then deciding finally, no, what was the point? Raking old leaves.Officially alone now in the world, Granger was free to chart his own course. He made his way north to San Sebastian, stayed awhile, then pressed west through the French hill towns until he found himself in St. Michel du ValcabrËre. He put up at the auberge, struck at once by the lovely valley that ran into the high Pyrenees, disappearing into the Spanish summits. There was one road into the village. The inhabitants kept to themselves and were not inquisitive. There seemed to him no good reason to move on, and so in October 1920 he bought the farmhouse and settled in for what turned out to be a very long furlough.When Thomas came downstairs at last, most of the guests were leaving or had gone. Bernhard and Russ were cleaning up in the kitchen. He said a few words to each of the friends who remained. They were ill at ease, at a loss what to say, their expressions genuinely aggrieved. Thomas's haggard appearance was not encouraging. No one stayed more than a few minutes and finally only Ghislaine, severe in a black dress and one of Florette's cardigan sweaters, was left.I'm so sorry, Ghislaine said.I know, Thomas said. Me too.Monsieur Granger and now Madame. Both in one week. It's a horror.Yes, Thomas said. It is that.She had so many friends. All of them came to pay respects. I will come tomorrow to clean. And each week thereafter if you would like me to.Yes, that would be fine.I know how Madame likes things done.I know you do.Thomas suppressed a smile because Florette hated housework and meticulous would not be the word when she got around to it. Yes, of course, Thomas said.I will charge you the usual rate.Tomorrow, then, Thomas said and closed the door. He stood with his hand on the knob, realizing that he had come within a heartbeat of raising his voice, calling to Florette, Do you want Ghislaine to come and clean tomorrow, chÈrie? And waiting patiently for her answer, which likely would have been no. She thought Ghislaine was a snoop. Probably that would be the way of things for a while, speaking aloud to empty rooms, brewing tisane for two, buying dinner for two, buying women's shampoo in the pharmacy and Paris-Match at the newsstand. When he realized at last that she was no longer with him and that this was for keeps, the knowledge would come as no comfort at all. That would mean she was absent from the background as well as the foreground. Of their intimate life together Thomas refused to undress himself. Aphrodite herself could not lure him. He was, for the time being, endimanchÈ, the lovely French word that meant buttoned up in your Sunday best. . . .'"
"'06-09-24,'0','Then, reports surfaced early last week that wide receiver Keegan Toci had been dismissed because he performed a sketch on the team’s traditional skit night that Coach Tim Murphy believed was disrespectful to the program. According to reports, Toci’s skit gave 20 reasons why Harvard, a Division I-AA team, would never rise to Division I-A.Harvard’s problems worsened in its Sept. 16 win over Holy Cross when Chris Pizzotti, O’Hagan’s replacement, was injured. That forced Murphy to turn to Harvard’s third-string quarterback, the sophomore Jeff Witt, for the Brown game.“We’re fortunate to be 2-0,” Murphy said. “We have a lot of things to clean up. Other than that, this was just another game. I’ve been a head coach for 20 years and I’ve never been through anything remotely like this. I know this: 99 percent of the kids we have had at Harvard are world-class human beings, the kind who you’d literally want your daughter to marry. That’s how I feel about the players on this team. Our kids have a lot of pride. Pride is important. That is their main motivation.”Making his first collegiate start, Witt turned in a strong performance. He completed 13 of 20 passes and threw for a touchdown. But his primary responsibility was to get the ball to Dawson, who needs 737 yards to pass Ed Marinaro as the Ivy League’s career rushing leader.Dawson scored Harvard’s first touchdown on a 1-yard run on its first possession. After Brown was forced to punt, Dawson once again took control, spearheading a four-play, 85-yard drive that he capped with a 58-yard touchdown run.“I knew Clifton was going to shoulder a large part of the load today, which he did,” Witt said. “That made it a lot easier for me. He could run the ball and pick up 7, 8 yards at any point.”Dawson’s third touchdown came early in the second quarter when he scored on a 2-yard run to give Harvard a 21-0 lead.Harvard went ahead, 31-15, in the third quarter and had little problem holding off a late rally from the Bears (1-1, 0-1 Ivy League).The loss snapped a nine-game winning streak for Brown, which has had fits handling Harvard. The Crimson have won seven in a row over Brown, including a 38-35 victory in double overtime last season.NEW HAMPSHIRE 56, DARTMOUTH 14 New Hampshire receiver David Ball caught three touchdown passes, tying Jerry Rice’s Division I-AA mark of 50 as the No. 1 Wildcats (3-0) beat host Dartmouth (0-2).(AP)COLUMBIA 23, GEORGETOWN 21 Craig Hormann threw for 158 yards and a touchdown as Columbia (2-0) edged Georgetown.

"'06-09-24,'0','Try telling that to McCareins, who lost his starting job to Cotchery during the preseason after starting every game in the previous two seasons. Outwardly, McCareins, a six-year veteran, appears to have taken his new role in stride, working harder, if that is possible, and without a peep of complaint.“Any time you go through a transition like that, it’s going to take its toll on you,” said Coles, who was limited in practice last week because of an injury to his left calf. “But I think Justin’s handled the situation better than anybody I’ve ever been around.”For McCareins, whose inner voice is his worst critic, the strain of his situation became plain this week when he initially begged out of an interview, saying he preferred to wait until he was in “a better place.”He has been in a personal purgatory since the opening of training camp, when he failed a conditioning run and was listed as physically unable to perform for three long days.It was a stunning development, akin to Rachael Ray’s serving a burned casserole. McCareins is considered one of the hardest workers on the Jets and he had impressed Eric Mangini, their first-year coach, with his performance in the off-season conditioning program.“Of course I was upset with myself for letting that happen for whatever reason,” McCareins said after eventually agreeing to let his guard down — but only a crack. “All I could do was just move on and play catch-up.”He added: “I’ve talked to Coach Mangini. I know that he’s always had good feelings about me. I wasn’t angry at him for what he did. He had his rules. He’s got to be consistent and stick to his program. I understand that. I actually respect him for it.”If cloth were McCareins’s chosen canvas instead of turf, he would be the artist who stands apart from the gallery crowd admiring his painting, fretting that his signature in the bottom-right corner is crooked.“I enjoy success,” said McCareins, who averaged 16 yards a catch for his first five seasons as a pro. “Maybe not as much as I should. To me there’s always more to do if you’re trying to strive for the perfect game or the perfect play or whatever.”On Sunday, McCareins will return to Ralph Wilson Stadium in Orchard Park, N.Y., which was the stage last year for the first 100-yard receiving game of his pro career. McCareins caught five passes for 116 yards in the Jets’ 27-17 loss to the Buffalo Bills last October.Asked this week what he remembered from that game, McCareins replied, “That we lost.”Is that it?“I’m sure there were still things when I watched the film from that game that I wasn’t happy with,” he said. “You always see things you could have done differently that would have made a little bit of a difference.”McCareins has a theory on why he is so hard on himself.“It might be a middle-child thing,” he said.McCareins’s older brother, John, graduated from Northwestern and received his master’s in business administration from Dartmouth. His younger brother, Jay, graduated from high school with a 4.3 grade-point average and was an all-American selection last year as a senior defensive back at Princeton.“I just had two brothers who were always so successful and so popular and so smart and so driven,” said McCareins, who was a four-year starter at Northern Illinois. “It used to drive me crazy how easy everything came to my younger brother. I have a pretty high-achieving family. I guess I took those qualities, good or bad, and have gone with them.”In the Jets’ family of receivers, the 27-year-old McCareins again finds himself a middle child of sorts.

"'06-09-24,'0','KATMANDU, Nepal, Sept. 23 (Reuters) — A private helicopter carrying 24 people on a trip organized by a global environmental group was reported missing in a remote region of eastern Nepal on Saturday, the group and authorities said.The conservation group, WWF, said that among those on the helicopter were a junior forest minister, his wife, three senior government officials, two Americans, a Finn, a Canadian and an Australian when it disappeared, and a crew of four, including two Russians.The BBC reported that the helicopter was taking the passengers on a 20-minute flight to a local airport in the Taplejung district, 190 miles from the capital, Katmandu, after they had attended a ceremony in which the government handed over the Kangenjunga conservation area to the local community.The WWF, formerly known as the World Wildlife Fund, said the helicopter was a Russian-made M1-17 owned by a local company, Sri Airlines.“We fear an unfortunate incident may have occurred,” said Ambar Bahadur Shakya, an airport official. “We have sent two helicopters for search operations because we have reports that weather is improving.”He said two search helicopters had been forced back by bad weather. Two ground teams have also been deployed to the area, which is remote and mountainous.'"
"'06-09-24,'0','As debacles go, the one last week at the hedge fund Amaranth Advisors was orderly. The fund’s star trader had bet big that natural gas prices would rise. They fell instead. On Monday, the fund admitted it had lost more than $3 billion, a sum later pegged at $6 billion. And yet, as of Friday, the fund, though badly battered, had managed to avoid liquidation.It could have been much worse — and not just for the investors who were burned.Hedge funds — largely unregulated investment pools for wealthy individuals and institutional investors — have infiltrated every corner of every market, taking big risks for big returns. Market players know that big risks can also mean big losses. But in the days after Amaranth’s meltdown they were unnerved by what they did not know, such as how much of Amaranth’s bet had been made with borrowed money. If questions about the fund’s ability to make good on its obligations had persisted — or if a default had ensued — markets would have been vulnerable to a debilitating chain reaction in which financial entities like banks and brokerages slam the brakes on deal making, hoping to avoid the accident unfolding in front of them.That didn’t happen this time. But Amaranth is only one of 9,000 hedge funds that collectively manage an estimated $1.2 trillion in assets — a size and scope undreamed of a decade ago. Not all hedge funds throw borrowed money at hot-handed traders to make outsized bets. But it would be naïve to think there aren’t more shocks in store.With that in mind, regulators need to act now to translate their various calls for hedge-fund oversight into enforceable rules and, in some instances, into concrete proposals for Congress to enact.A week before the Amaranth debacle, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, Timothy Geithner, said in a speech that the growth in hedge funds would eventually force regulators to think about ways to better protect the financial system. Eventually is now. Two years ago, the Securities and Exchange Commission passed a rule to register hedge funds, with the goal of greater oversight of pension investments in hedge funds. The rule was flawed, and was overturned in court. But the aim was a good one. The S.E.C. should pursue a focused set of hedge-fund reforms and Congress should pass a law to prevent pension funds from investing in hedge funds that do not submit to federal regulation.Congress should also repeal a law from 2000 that limits regulators’ ability to monitor over-the-counter derivative securities — financial instruments not listed on the exchanges. That market has grown markedly in recent years and contributes greatly to hedge funds’ wheeling and dealing.'"
"'06-09-24,'0','AMERICA, the cost of filling up your Hummer just got $16 cheaper.The price for a gallon of regular gasoline now averages just under $2.50 nationwide, according to the Energy Information Administration. While that is not exactly cheap, it beats the $3-plus per gallon seen as recently as last month. (For those keeping score at home, the Hummer H2 has a 32-gallon tank.)So what does this mean for the midterm elections?Democrats have been beating the oil drum for months, coupling rising gas prices with oil companies reaping record profits and big tax breaks. In commercials from the Democratic Senate Campaign Committee, Representative Sherrod Brown, a Democrat running for Senate from Ohio, is described as having “fought for tax cuts for the middle class, not for oil companies,” while a different ad criticizes Senator Jon Kyl, an Arizona Republican, saying he “voted oil companies billions in special tax breaks.” Yet another ad from the committee, for the Senate race in Missouri, asserts that the Republican incumbent, Jim Talent, “has voted to give the oil and gas companies billions,” while his Democratic opponent, Claire McCaskill, would instead invest more federal money in alternative fuels.Voters can expect this tack to continue, despite the falling prices.“We still see it as a strong issue for two reasons,” said Charles Schumer, the New York Democrat who runs the Senate campaign committee. “First, just about everybody believes they’re going to go back up again, and second, it’s an example, one of many, of the administration and the Republican Senate not having a policy that makes people’s lives better.”Republicans, on the other hand, believe the sting of this argument is waning.“Virtually every newspaper in America is reporting on their front page that gas prices are plummeting,” said Ed Patru, a spokesman for the National Republican Campaign Committee. “That denies Democrats another issue that they’re trying to use to nationalize the election.”Poll numbers show that high gas prices are receding as an issue. Back in May, 14 percent of those surveyed by the Pew Research Center said energy prices were the nation’s most important problem, ahead of terrorism and Iraq, up from 5 percent in March. This month, only 7 percent gave energy prices top billing. Gallup has had similar findings.'"

"'06-09-24,'0','“Twenty years ago, the dog run was where the dog lived when he was in the kennel,” said Mr. Krack, who started the association 30 years ago and ran a kennel for 16 years. “Today a dog run is where he rests between activities.”And the menu of diversions is growing longer and, some might say, more extravagant. Depending on the kennel — or hotel or spa or resort — a dog’s activities can include hiking, swimming, listening to music, watching television, dining on gourmet meals and getting a pedicure, complete with nail polish.The kennels’ amenities are becoming more lavish as well. Heated tile floors and high-tech ventilation systems are de rigueur. In many cases, chain-link dog runs have given way to rooms — for marketing purposes, kennel owners refer to them as “bungalows,” “villas” and “suites” — that come with solid walls, windows and custom-made furnishings. And even as the prices for such pampering rise — in some instances well beyond $100 a night — dog owners are lining up to give their pets what they view as the perfect vacation.Kennels are not the only pet-related business that’s booming. The American Pet Products Manufacturers Association estimates that people will spend $38.4 billion on their pets this year; that would mean an increase of $2.1 billion, or 5.8 percent, over 2005. For services, like grooming and boarding, pet owners are expected to spend $2.7 billion this year.The increase is partly a result of rising pet ownership: about 63 percent of United States households now have pets, compared with 56 percent in 1988. But it is also an indication of the changing role of the pet in the family and growing emotional ties between owners and pets.The trend “highlights the profound love that many of us have for our dogs,” said Patricia B. McConnell, author of “For the Love of a Dog: Understanding Emotion in You and Your Best Friend,” published this month by Ballantine Books.That love “has not been critically examined as much as it deserves to be,” said Dr. McConnell, who has a doctorate in zoology. “It’s a biological phenomenon. Hurricane Katrina reminded us that people actually risk and sometimes choose to lose their life over their dog. That’s a biologically amazing fact.”The luxury kennels reflect the complexity of the bond between humans and dogs, she said. “There’s actually one that just opened up in Madison — called Club Bow-Wow — that I would be just perfectly happy to stay in,” said Dr. McConnell, who teaches a course called “The Biology and Philosophy of Human-Animal Relationships,” at the University of Wisconsin in Madison.If a dog stays in the $50-a-day “ambassador suite” at Club Bow-Wow, a staff member sleeps overnight in the room. Dogs that opt for the “presidential suite,” also $50 a day, spend the day in the office of the center’s owner and manager, though they aren’t quite interns.Other luxury kennels offer services from pedicures to parties for pets, charging as much as $185 a night.Of course, how much of this is for the dog’s benefit, as opposed to its owner’s, is open to debate. Corey Cohen, an animal-behavior consultant whose business, called A New Leash on Life, works with dogs and horses in Pennsylvania and New Jersey, says that some services at luxury kennels are more meaningful to people than to pets. “Because it’s away from its owner, the dog is either going to be stressed or not stressed whether it’s in a regular old-fashioned kennel or a camp for dogs,” he said. “Any time there’s change, they’re stressed. From the owner’s perspective, they’re going to want to reduce their guilt.”At Top Dog Country Club, on 42 acres about an hour’s drive west of Minneapolis, dogs check in at a hotel-style front desk in a lobby filled with photographs of dogs that are or have been part of Ms. Beuning’s family. The 5,000-square-foot building has 46 rooms spread over six bays.The suites have heated concrete floors and textured walls topped with trellises and faux plants. “They’re harder to clean,” Ms. Beuning said of the walls, “but they give the dogs something a little more interesting to look at.”Inside the suites are custom-made wrought-iron beds with orthopedic mattresses and tapestry covers. (And just like the beds in some hotels for humans, the dog beds can be bought for home use.)Pampering is certainly part of the package. In the afternoon, when the dogs return to their suites from their daily activities, they get freshly baked biscuits. Baths and massages are available for an extra charge. And before lights-out, around 9 p.m., Ms. Beuning or one of her employees reads a bedtime story over the sound system. The stories, written by local schoolchildren, may tell of dogs “chasing kitty cats in their dreams,” she said.But Ms. Beuning said she rejected some amenities that might be offered only to impress owners.“The priority here is always about the dogs,” she said. So her center plays soothing music — classical, with a good helping of Frank Sinatra mixed in — but there are no televisions. Then again, she said, the dogs don’t need TV’s because they exercise so well during the day that they are ready to sleep at night.Some dogs spend five or six hours a day in one of the three play yards that cover a total of 18,000 square feet, she said. They romp on artificial turf, chase one another and play with the 15 staff members. The supervised group play time, she said, is an important draw for her 4,000 customers who are willing to spend up to $55 a night to board their dogs.The notion of play time — having a kennel employee take a dog for a walk, throw it a Frisbee or groom it — goes back about 10 years, Mr. Krack said. It allowed kennel owners to increase their income without increasing the number of dog runs. A kennel that charged, say, $10 a day for boarding could charge an additional $5 for play time. If an owner wanted his dog to have two play times a day, the kennel could double its revenue.“That service really was, I think, the start of this concept of socialization for boarding pets,” Mr. Krack said. At first, he added, dogs from different families were never allowed to mingle.That, however, soon changed. Customers who were accustomed to taking their pets to dog parks began to expect more: community play. “The kennel operators began to realize that this is what their customers demanded, whether they were comfortable with it or not,” Mr. Krack said.COMFORT has been the essential business challenge for Emerson Hughes since he became a kennel operator in 1972. When he opened the first of his two Holiday Barn Pet Resorts in the Richmond, Va., area, he was proud of its modern operations. From the beginning, though, customers would drop off their pets and make comments like, “I hate leaving my dog in a place like this.”Initially insulted, Mr. Hughes said he learned that the comments were not criticisms of his kennel but reflections of the perception that boarding kennels were “doggie jails.”“We were a necessity that the public had to tolerate,” he said.For a customer flying off to spend a week on the beach in Tahiti, the thought of a precious pet’s incarceration could put a damper on the entire trip. Mr. Hughes said he knew that no matter how immaculate his kennel was and no matter how well he cared for the animals, the customer could still feel guilt.“We were providing an institutional service that was just enough for the customer emotionally to get by,” Mr. Hughes said. “We would keep that dog and we wouldn’t let him escape. And they felt like that was enough. We had to learn to present an image that satisfied the owner’s needs, not just the pet’s needs.”It’s important for owners to feel good about their pets’ stays, he said, adding with a laugh, because “I never could get these dogs to write checks.”Mr. Hughes decided to convert the fear factor into a fun factor. In the 1970’s and early 80’s, he hired teenagers, mostly girls, to pet the dogs during holiday periods.“We put them in candy-stripe jackets, and it was their job to walk down the rows and pet every pet that they could touch,” he said. “The public loved it, but we didn’t charge for it. I didn’t know any better.”In the mid-1980’s, Mr. Hughes began to hire managers who had more business experience than dog-handling experience and encouraged his staff to try new things.After adding activities for dogs, he said, “our animal health improved because these animals weren’t stuck in a pen all day — they had human contact.”Now he offers community play and swimming, along with special events like turkey barbecues for Thanksgiving and weekly tailgate parties during college football season.When customers are confident that their dogs are having fun, Mr. Hughes said, they can better enjoy their own vacations.Even pet owners who choose just the basic boarding package seem more confident that their dogs are getting good care.Where it will stop is anyone’s guess, said Mr. Krack of the boarding kennel association. “You can always do more,” he said. And unlimited fun appears to be leashed to unlimited revenue enhancers.At Mazzu’s Canine and Feline Hotel in Philadelphia, Jenee Mazzu offers a luxury pet hotel for “the discriminating pet owner.” A night in a suite costs $155 to $185, depending on the size of the room. (The largest is 7 feet by 7 feet.)The daily rate includes the “personal suite, platform bed, comforter, toys, TV/DVD, two walks, one 40-minute jaunt to the dog park, feedings, unlimited bottled water, climate-controlled facility, daily maid service, 24-hour on-site care,” the Mazzu’s Web site says. For an additional $25, Mazzu’s will serve the dog a filet mignon dinner.The hotel can accommodate up to seven dogs, Ms. Mazzu said, and since it opened about eight months ago, occupancy has averaged about three dogs a day.The response to the hotel runs to the extremes, she said. “Either people say, ‘Thank God you started this company,’ or, ‘This is crazy,’ ” Ms. Mazzu said. “There’s not a lukewarm response.”One man kept his Doberman at the hotel for nine days, she said, and ordered a filet for it every other day.A DOG’S experience in a boarding kennel depends largely on the dog’s personality, said Mr. Cohen, the pet behaviorist. “People are trying to push dogs into Stepford dogs,” he said, noting that many dogs enjoy socializing with other dogs but that some do not. “I think they’re individuals.”Beyond being companions, dogs serve different purposes for different owners, Mr. Cohen said. In some cases, a dog can be a surrogate child. In others, the dog is a source of entertainment. And it is important for owners to be aware of the function the dog is being asked to fulfill.When it comes to luxury kennels, he said, “dog owners need to understand that it’s not necessary.” But he also said that there was little harm in most of the special services and amenities.“I dress up my own dogs for Halloween,” Mr. Cohen said. “But I’m aware that I’m doing it to entertain myself, not because the dogs need to dress up.”Carol Boerio-Croft, who has two locations in the Pittsburgh area for her Cozy Inn Pet Resort and Orchid Spa, has built her kennel business on what she calls canine feng shui. “Cozy Inn’s mission is to create and provide a loving, sensitive, healthy, safe naturally controlled environment for our guests; take care of them completely: mentally, emotionally, medically, spiritually and physically,” she says on her Web site. “And to always treat them with love and respect.”With that in mind, she offers an indoor swimming pool and whirlpool, a choice of full-body, Swedish or sports massages, and hot-oil treatments. “Our clientele are not dog people,” Ms. Boerio-Croft said in a telephone interview. “I always correct that because normally dog people go to kennels. But our clientele is above average and elite. And we are an environment where the pets are very anthropomorphically treated like little people.”KENNEL operators are not the only ones profiting from dog owners’ separation anxiety. Blake Walliser of Denver runs Online Doggy, a business that uses Web cameras to let dog owners peek in on their pets whenever they wish, from wherever they are; Mr. Walliser said his pet business grew out of a failed plan to offer the same service to day care centers for children.Online Doggy has four full-time employees and provides Web camera services for 200 pet care providers, he said.As trends go, the luxury kennel seems here to stay. Joe Timko of Canyon View Ranch in Topanga, Calif., near Malibu, said, “From the day we opened the doors, we filled up.” And Canyon View Ranch is already fully booked for Christmas 2008.“Isn’t that something?” he said.'"
"'06-09-24,'0','TO demonstrate that feasible zero-emissions cars can be built without waiting for the price of fuel cells to come down to earth, BMW will produce a small test fleet of luxury sedans that use clean-burning hydrogen in conventional piston engines.The cars, which will carry a Hydrogen 7 badge on the trunk lid, are based on the company’s flagship 7 Series sedan. The car’s 6-liter V-12 engine burns either hydrogen or gasoline, giving it a range of more than 400 miles, BMW says.BMW will build about 100 of the cars; 25 to 30 will be shipped to the United States starting in the first half of 2007. The cars will be lent — not leased or sold — to selected consumers for evaluation. BMW, which is pushing for a hydrogen supply network to be built, will use mobile filling stations to supply the hydrogen.The Hydrogen 7 has two fuel tanks. One stores 17.6 pounds of liquid hydrogen, good for 125 miles. When it is empty, the car automatically switches to its 19.5- gallon gasoline tank for another 300 miles. The driver can also switch fuels by pressing a button on the steering wheel. BMW says the engine produces 260 horsepower on either fuel.'"
"'06-09-24,'0','Apparently the Orthodox community in Lawrence thinks its situation with regard to private school tuition and public school taxes is unique. It isn’t. People who willingly pay school taxes support the system because it is good for the children and the community, and a good school system keeps real estate values strong.In my opinion, the example being shown to the children of Lawrence is very damaging, and will have long-term negative effects.I’ve been a resident of School District 15 for 25 years. I have paid school taxes that have faithfully increased each year. The school board, under its previous leadership, squandered funds and let surpluses disappear without making repairs on school buildings or addressing problems in education — for example, why so many of their students were flunking out.Taxation without representation — in Lawrence, N.Y., that’s what was going on. It was time for a change. I am happy about the new school board and its commitment to fiscal responsibility and accountability for all the students of the district.This school board didn’t take over. It was elected by a majority. Parents are scapegoating one group, when it was their own failure to hold the previous board accountable to its duties that is the real cause of the decline in the district’s performance.As someone who spends $15,000 a year to send my children to private school, I admittedly may be doing passive harm to the public school system by depriving my community of two worthy students. But the active role the Orthodox in Lawrence, N.Y., are taking is a cynical attempt to employ a perverted justice.Public schooling is a right of every American. How dare those who forfeit its services try to manipulate its budget. May public school parents join the board of the Hebrew Academy of the Five Towns and Rockaway and hold sway over how that school spends its money?There is only one reasonable cure for the school board disputes in Lawrence, N.Y., and other places, with Orthodox Jews or other religious sects and denominations who are in the majority: the county or the state should legislate that one of the requisites for running for a seat on the board is to have a child in the public schools!I have only one criticism of “Too Good for a Trade?,” by Paul Levine (Op-Ed, Sept. 17): the curtailment of vocational education is not merely a Westchester problem — it is a national problem.For some reason, our academics and politicians seem to ignore the importance of well-trained craftsmen and tradesmen (here the suffix “men” in no way excludes female participation, which should be welcome and encouraged). Mr. Levine could well replace every occurrence of “Westchester County” with “the nation.”'"
"'06-09-24,'0','The crowd here tends to be young, or young at heart, wealthy and on the make. During the Christmas-to-Easter polo season — yes, there’s an up-to-date polo facility, a big draw for European and South American playboy types — lavish dinner and cocktail parties unfold in the villas, which rent for up to $6,000 a night for their infinity pools, sprawling thatched roofs and open-air living areas with steep cliff-side views instead of doors or windows.The parties often stretch into the wee hours, with well-dressed revelers plunging into the pools, hot tubs or the silk-textured ocean. (The mysterious invitations to these late-night gatherings arrive via the house managers who do double duty as blue-chip social connectors.) As at a surrealist country club, after several nights of these boozy fetes you still have no idea what these people do in the real world, and it’s considered bad form, after all, to make such direct inquiries. Which was why when I visited last January, I kept racing to the computer at my hotel’s business center to Google my new best friends. If only the Internet had existed during Gatsby’s time!“Careyes draws a very affluent international crowd, but they are more attuned to aesthetics then status,” said Tim Parsa, a businessman and writer in his 30’s who lives in Mexico City and Manhattan and goes to Careyes for the polo. He was perched in a shaded corner of the beach typing a screenplay on a laptop one recent morning. “Here people aren’t overwrought with that aggressive pursuit of a good time,” he added.Mr. Brignone developed Careyes as a leisure-class utopia where social standing would be measured by eccentricity and caftans, not big yachts and golf courses. He discovered the eight-mile stretch of land on a tip from a friend, Antenor Patino, the Bolivian tin baron who developed Las Hadas, the luxury resort featured in the movie “10.” Mr. Brignone commissioned architects like Marco Aldaco and Diego Villasenor to build a handful of brightly painted, whimsical Mexican-Mediterranean-style bungalows. One villa, Casa Mi Ojo, in homage to Mr. Brignone’s missing left eye, has a hanging bridge suspended 90 feet above the ocean that leads to a little island and a huge eye carved into the side wall with a pupil that doubles as a peephole window.Mr. Brignone’s well-heeled European friends, including the Fiat scion Gianni Agnelli, Egon Von Furstenberg and the billionaire financier Sir James Goldsmith came to visit, and soon the word spread.A few more villas have been added at Careyes over the years, but you still rarely see another car or person on the cobblestone streets that laze past the lushly planted mansionesque villas with names like Parasol and Candelabro. Strolling on the beach one warm starlit night, my traveling companion and I happened upon a dinner given by Ms. Marcaccini. A long table for 40 lighted by torches and sprinkled with bougainvillea and copa de oro had been set up on the main beach by the charming pink and thatched Italian restaurant that’s the nexus of the social scene. Both beach and restaurant are named Playa RosaThe guests, a whirl of slender shoulders draped in shawls, clinked glasses of red wine and margaritas in a scene that could easily have been airlifted in from a fashion show afterparty in New York or London. They included the model Jacquetta Wheeler, the English fashion designer Alice Temperly, the actress Minnie Driver and the actor Danny Huston.“Celebrities like it here because it’s private, and there’s no paparazzi,” said Viviana Dean, who manages several of the villas. “People looking for a glitzy, loud vacation tend not to want to come here anyway. ”During the day the best eye candy is at the Playa Rosa beach, which plays out like a jet-set version of “Gilligan’s Island.” Just-rolled-out-of-bed guests begin to show up around noon and lounge on the straw mats strewn about on a lush green lawn shaded by big stately palms. Sun chairs, umbrellas and jet skis are not allowed by Mr. Brignone. I didn’t see a single pair of designer sunglasses or logo beach totes. Instead the statement tended toward a label-free array of exotic muumuus and wraps that looked like they were from far-flung medinas and bazaars.At lunchtime, groups slipping into and out of English, French, Spanish and Italian pulled up to tables under a shaded patio at the restaurant and ordered delicate salads, ceviche and half portions of risotto. The very rich often don’t carry cash so the restaurant’s manager, Augusto, is always forgiving bottles of Pellegrino and margaritas, especially for bikinied women.There are several little rocky islands that are close enough to the beach to swim to. We were told that one had a human nest built by the Sky Cries Mary singer-turned-sculptor Roderick Romero, who fashions elaborate tree houses for clients who have included Donna Karan and Sting. We decided to swim out, but as we made our way through the clear warm water, we were intercepted midway by some handsome men in a Zodiac outboard who invited us for drinks and backgammon aboard their boat followed by a helicopter ride over the area.After a few days, we had stopped being surprised by such idyllic social encounters. It was just another day as usual in Careyes.'"
"'06-09-24,'0','And major park attractions may be simply unavailable. Low water levels in October and November dry up Yosemite’s waterfalls, and in winter the Grand Canyon can sometimes be obscured by fog. But all of this just makes the wilderness feel a bit more wild. Animals tend to be more visible against a white backdrop of snow. In Yellowstone, herds of elk and bison congregate in lower elevations during the winter, attracting seldom-seen predators like wolves.Here is a guide to visiting some of the most popular national parks during the off-season:Quiet Season: The least crowded months are January and February. Midweek during the fall can be a good time to visit, though leaf-peepers proliferate on weekends and much of October.What to Do: Take in the vistas during a long hike. A heavy haze and pollution reduce visibility to about 20 miles from June through September. In the fall and winter, visibility stretches to 50 or 60 miles.Where to Stay: LeConte Lodge, at about 6,600 feet, is very rustic, with no electricity or showers. But it is the only lodge within the park and fills up quickly for autumn weeks. Cancellations can occur, so it’s worth checking; (865) 429-5704, www.lecontelodge.com. A cabin costs $89 a night per person including dinner and breakfast. After the lodge closes around Thanksgiving, visitors tend to stay in nearby mountain towns.What to Do: Peer over the rim into the chasm below. Watch for bald eagles, which usually arrive in November. If there are heavy snows in higher elevations, look for elk, deer and bighorn sheep heading to lower ground in search of food.Where to Stay: The historic El Tovar Hotel, right on the rim of the canyon. Earlier this month, it was already nearly full for April and May 2007, but rooms were available from the last week in November this year through March. Rates begin at $134 a night for a standard room, (888) 297-2757, www.grandcanyonlodges.com.What to Do: Yosemite Valley and the mountain vistas are stunning at any season. During the winter, go ice-skating in Curry Village. December through March, hop the free shuttle bus to Badger Pass Ski Area for family-oriented skiing and snowboarding. Or pay a visit to Yosemite Falls if there has been some recent rain or snow.Where to Stay: The Awahnee, an upscale hotel of the kind not often found in the national park system. Though it is nearly sold out for Christmas, about half of its 123 rooms are available from January through March; (559) 253-5676, www.yosemitepark.com. Rates begin at $394 a night.Quiet Season: Now through May.What to Do: In October and November, visitors can see salmon swimming upstream to spawn or spot Roosevelt elk. The elk can be heard too — their bugling, the bulls’ mating calls, resonates through the Hoh Valley. Winters here can be dreary, with average sea-level temperatures in the low 50’s and up to six inches of rain a day in certain parts of the park. But that can also be a good excuse to curl up by the fire with a good book or watch a powerful Pacific storm roll in.Where to Stay: Kalaloch Lodge, perched on a bluff overlooking the Pacific. Lodge rooms drop to $99 from $149 during high season; (866) 525-2562, www.visitkalaloch.com.Quiet Season: Now through mid-October and Dec. 20 to mid-March. With the exception of the year-round road from Gardiner, Mont., to Cooke City, Mont., park roads typically close for the season on the first Monday of November, making it difficult to get around the park until the winter season of snowmobile and snow coach travel begins in mid-December.What to Do: Sign up for one of the Winter Wolf Discovery tours given from Dec. 27 to Feb. 25 by the Yellowstone Association Institute, www.yellowstoneassociation.org. Cost: $515 per person based on double occupancy for four nights at the Mammoth Hot Springs Hotel, breakfast and box lunches.Where to Stay: Winter getaway packages are available Jan. 1 through March 2 at the Mammoth Hot Springs Hotel and through March 9 at the Old Faithful Snow Lodge. Two-night Frosty Fun packages, including breakfast, unlimited ice skating and skates, start at $99 a person based on double occupancy at Mammoth and $245 a person at the Snow Lodge.

Just the scene outside is worth a visit, as church employees herd the flocks of easily tamed tourists into lines as though it were Disney World. Nearby, women sell individual-size sweet potato pies, and a retired chauffeur hawks CD’s by Gladys Knight, Ray Charles and other stars of soul.You’ll be tempted to go to one of the popular after-church gospel brunches, but look out for the tour buses that can flood a place like a Roy Rogers at an Interstate rest stop. No one deserves to be caught up in crowds of French and Spanish and Japanese tourists oohing and aahing over collard greens and hush puppies, as can happen in popular spots like Sylvia’s and Copeland’s if you pick the wrong day.Culture without praying, clapping and swaying is also available. The Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture has public programs, and the Studio Museum highlights (but is not exclusive to) the neighborhood and black artists.At some point, you need to turn onto 125th Street. Avert your eyes, if you must, as you pass the Body Shop and Dunkin’ Donuts, but look for the Apollo Theater, still going strong after all these years, and the signs that mark the former locations of Blumstein’s Department Store (where Harlemites protested, successfully, the lack of black employees in 1934) and the Hotel Theresa (where Castro stayed in 1960 and met with Khrushchev).There are also the smaller versions of Harlem architecture: residential blocks, many of them with landmark status. The blocks known as Strivers Row, 138th and 139th Streets between Adam Clayton Powell Jr. and Frederick Douglass Boulevards, are made up of neo-Georgian and neo-Renaissance buildings that still have “Walk Your Horses” written on the gates. On 130th Street, between Fifth and Lenox, are the brick houses with wooden porches known as Astor Row.Up by 161st Street on the edge of Washington Heights, near the Morris-Jumel Mansion, is Sylvan Terrace, a startling throwback: wooden houses that look more like a movie set than a modern, living street. Sugar Hill, especially Convent Avenue between 141st and 145th Streets, is known for its brownstones, and the nearby City College has neo-Gothic buildings that were partly built from the dark schist that came from the digging of subway tunnels a century ago.Abyssinian Baptist Church, 132 West 138th Street, (212) 862-7474.

"'06-09-25,'1','BAGHDAD, Sept. 25 — A senior Al Qaeda operative who engineered a brazen escape from a high security American prison in Afghanistan last year was killed in a predawn raid by British soldiers in a quiet, wealthy neighborhood in southern Iraq on Monday, officials said.Two companies of about 250 soldiers wearing night goggles and carrying night-vision rifles stormed a house in the neighborhood of al-Tuninnah in Basra, intending to capture the operative. The spokesman for the British military in Iraq, Maj. Charles Burbridge, I identified the operative as Omar al-Faruq. But they were fired upon as they entered and shot back, killing Mr. Faruq.Major Burbridge said Mr. Faruq was “a terrorist of considerable significance” who had been hiding in Basra, but he declined to say whether this was the same man who escaped from the American military detention center in Bagram, Afghanistan, last July. Mr. Faruq’s identity was confirmed by an American official in Washington and by an official in Basra, who was not authorized to speak on the subject.At the time of his arrest, in Jakarta, Indonesia, in June, 2002, Mr. Faruq was described at as one of the most important Al Qaeda figures ever captured by the United States. He was later transferred to the detention facility at Bagram, 40 miles north of Kabul, where he was interrogated by the American military.As evidence of his seniority, he was transferred out of military custody, apparently taken by Central Intelligence Agency officers, who hold the most senior terrorist suspects. He was back in the military system by the time of his escape, and was on a list of prisoners marked for transfer to Guantánamo Bay, Cuba.Mr. Faruq, whose mother, an Iraqi national, lives in Iraq, had entered the country about two weeks ago from Kuwait, according to an Iraqi official and to a neighbor who lived next door to the house that was raided by British soldiers overnight.'"
"'06-09-25,'1','Other market watchers noted that prices for oil for future delivery, which some economists use for their planning purposes, have not fallen as much as spot prices, and that most futures contracts continue to hover around $66 a barrel.“The story is still very much the same for the futures market,” said Eoin O’Callaghan, an oil analyst with BNP Paribas. “That points to more expensive oil in the coming months.”So-called noncommercial buyers, meaning hedge funds and investors rather than the producers and refiners who actually ship and use the oil, have poured money into energy and commodities markets in recent years, believing that growth in places like China, India and Brazil had put the world into a “super cycle” that would continue to drive up prices even if major industrial nations faltered. In recent weeks, many of the noncommercials have bailed out again as prices started to fall.The members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries have been in telephone contact about the market trend but as yet they have no plans to convene an emergency meeting to address falling prices, an OPEC spokesman said today. The cartel last met on Sept. 11.About 22,000 noncommercial buyers now hold long positions — that is, bets that crude oil prices will rise — according to the most recent report from the Commodity Futures Trading Corporation; in August the figure was 83,000. “It is a huge reversal in position,” said David Kirsch, an oil markets analyst with PFC Energy in Washington.PFC noted in a report today that noncommercials have been reducing their long positions for five straight weeks, and have pushed prices below their 200-day moving average, a significant marker to technical analysts of the market.Kamal Murari, global head of energy marketing for Dresdner Kleinwort, said: “The move down that has taken place has been sharp and sudden. The fact that it has moved as significantly as it has means that any forced liquidation has been mostly priced into the market.”Many market participants think OPEC will act to stem the decline if prices fall to $55 a barrel, Mr. Murari said.He suggested that some of the selling in the oil market may be linked to the recent well-publicized losses by some big investors in natural gas, which may have forced some funds to liquidate other energy assets.For the consumer, retail fuel prices have fallen markedly in the United States, but less so in Europe, where excise taxes are much higher and crude accounts for a proportionally smaller part of the pump price.For the larger economy, falling oil prices may do little now to counteract slowing growth on either side of the Atlantic, economists said.“It doesn’t feed through that if the crude price falls below X, then economic growth will rise by Y,” said Mike Wittner, an energy analyst at Calyon.'"
"'06-09-25,'1','“I’d expect home sales to continue softening, but perhaps not at the dramatic pace we saw a little earlier,” said Celia Chen, director of housing economics at Moody’s Economy .com. “The markets are just very overvalued right now.’’If the sales trends are leveling off, however, prices still appear set to fall further.David A. Lereah, chief economist for the Realtors association, said the price drop was a taste of what the market should expect in the coming months. But he predicted that prices would probably improve next year.“We’re in for a ride right now,” Mr. Lereah said. “This is the first of many price corrections for the remaining months of the year — for at least the next three or four months.”Until this year, the housing sector had enjoyed a boom of more than half a decade, chalking up ever higher numbers of sales and rapidly rising prices. But it has been shrinking under the impact of rising mortgage rates and a slowing economy.As the Realtors and economists see it, falling prices may be just what the housing market needs before sales can revive again. In some regions of the country last month, sales rose where prices fell. In the Northeast, sales rose 1.9 percent as the median price fell 3.9 percent, to $271,000. In the Midwest the pattern was the same: sales were up 0.7 percent and the median price was down 1.1 percent, to $176,000.The opposite occurred in the West. While prices have held steady there this summer, sales have fallen. In August, sales dropped 2.3 percent while the median price rose 0.3 percent, to $345,000. Compared with a year earlier, sales have fallen 22.8 percent.“Something’s going to give in the West,” Mr. Lereah said. “The correction has not occurred in the West yet. Sellers are stubborn there.”In the South, sales volume in August was 0.8 percent lower than July 2006 and 7.4 percent lower than August 2005. The median existing-home price fell 2.6 percent, to $184,000, from July to August.By comparison, data from the federal government has shown prices leveling off for some time. A report from the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight released this month showed that prices nationwide increased 1.2 percent in the second quarter, the weakest gain in almost seven years.Some economists prefer the government’s price data because it tries to adjust for changes in the quality and size of homes sold from one year to the next.The Realtors association numbers do not take into account incentives by sellers, which could skew their median price numbers higher.At the end of August, there were so many unsold homes on the market that it would take seven and a half months to sell them all at the current sales pace. The association said that was the biggest backlog since April 1993.Economists said that as the number of unsold homes on the market continued to rise, sellers would have little choice but to cut prices.“With the supply of unsold homes reaching yet another record high, there is only one way this market can clear, and that is through even further price falls,” wrote Dimitry Fleming, an economist for ING Bank. For all the worries about declining prices, though, Joshua Shapiro, chief United States economist with MFR, said the price decline in August should be viewed in the context of a 111 percent increase in the median single-family home price over the last 11 years.“The underlying trend here is one of stable to modestly lower prices after the sharp gains seen for many years,” he wrote in a research note. “It should not be a huge shock that we are seeing a price correction.”'"
"'06-09-25,'1','A summary of top stories from Russian newspapers on Monday.TOP STORY: PUTIN OFFERS GAS TO EUROPE — Russia’s President, Vladimir Putin, announced on Saturday that Russia is prepared to divert up to 45 billion cubic meters of gas a year from the Shtokman gas fields to Europe from its intended destination, the United States. The news, delivered at a trilateral meeting between Mr. Putin and Angela Merkel, the German chancellor and French president, Jacques Chirac, was a surprise, according to Russia’s major newspapers. Even the state-controlled gas company, Gazprom, which controls the Shtokman fields, was not informed of the proposal beforehand, according to an unnamed source close to the company quoted by Vedomosti.President Putin made clear that he expects a few things in exchange for the deal, which he says will guarantee the European Union’s gas needs for between 50 and 70 years. Most importantly, says Kommersant, Russia wants greater access to European energy markets. Nezavisimaya Gazeta writes that the European Energy Charter, which Moscow says is outdated, currently bocks Russia’s full participation in Europe’s energy affairs. Ms. Merkel and Mr. Chirac also promised to discuss ways to grant Russia’s request for a role in the European Aeronautic Defense and Space Company, the parent of Airbus, Nezavisimaya Gazeta writes.Mr. Putin’s decision to favor Europe over the United States comes in response to a general chilling of Russian-American relations, according to sources and experts quoted by Vedomosti. Washington has angered Moscow with its sanctions against Russia’s major weapons producers, as well as its position on Russia’s accession to the World Trade Organization, the newspaper writes. A source in the Kremlin said the United States will not be completely cut off from Shtokman gas, but will have access to a smaller volume than originally planned.Until now, writes Vedomosti, Gazprom had planned to deliver between 22.5 to 30 billion cubic meters of gas from Shtokman to the United States initially, eventually increasing the volume to 67.5 cubic meters. According to Kommersant, despite Mr. Putin’s statement, the situation may change prior to the March energy summit in Berlin.HUMAN RIGHTS ADDED TO CURRICULUM — Human rights will be taught as a class in Russian schools and universities starting next year, Andrei Frusyenko, Russia’s minister of education announced on Sunday. Classes will acquaint students with rights guaranteed by international law and the Russian Constitution. According to Mr. Frusyenko, this will make Russia the most human-rights-oriented country in the world.DESPITE AMNESTY, CHECHEN VIOLENCE INCREASES — The passage of a bill in the State Duma granting amnesty to militants in the North Caucasus has been followed by attacks in Chechnya over the weekend on local police and military personnel that have resulted in several deaths. Trouble in the region has been exacerbated by conflicts among pro-governmental military formations. The more this problem is discussed, according to the newspaper, the more Ramzan Kadyrov, Chechnya’s prime minister, denies it as rumor.'"
"'06-09-25,'1','Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg’s trip to California last week was as much about raising money for his new political paisan, Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, below, as anything else. But people who attended the fund-raisers seemed struck by the New York mayor and his politics, despite Mr. Bloomberg’s repeated denials of having any national ambitions.“I just think he’s refreshing,” said Preston Butcher, a real-estate developer who attended the first fund-raiser, at a hotel in East Palo Alto. “He doesn’t talk out of both sides of his mouth. He’s more interested in people than he is in the party.”Katherine Alden, a hotel owner, said: “His answers are honest, direct, balanced. I was very, very impressed.”Later, at a fund-raising dinner at the Stockton estate of Alex Spanos, a developer and owner of the San Diego Chargers, guests reported that Mr. Bloomberg had made no mention of running for president.“Not a peep,” said Don Parsons, a campaign consultant and Republican donor from Stockton.Stephen Thurtle, a Sacramento developer, said of Mr. Bloomberg, “The only thing he joked about is, he recommended becoming a billionaire before going into politics,” adding, “He’s a very charismatic guy.”Don Troppmann, another guest, offered this succinct comment on the mayor: “He was great. He was short.” SEWELL CHAN and DAVID SIDERSAfter sniping at one another for the last few weeks from afar, the Senate candidates in New Jersey and those in Connecticut will face one another in a series of debates in each state before the Nov. 7 election.In Connecticut, Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, who is running as an independent, and the man who beat him in the Democratic primary, Ned Lamont, will debate at least two times. The first debate, on Oct. 16 in Stamford, will be broadcast on Cablevision 12. The second, on Oct. 23 in New London, will be broadcast on WTNH-TV.Mr. Lieberman and Mr. Lamont will be joined by the Republican nominee, Alan Schlesinger, who trails far behind in the polls.In New Jersey, Senator Robert Menendez, a Democrat who is seeking a full six-year term, will debate his Republican opponent, State Senator Thomas H. Kean Jr., above, three times in October.The first debate, sponsored by The New York Times and the CBS affiliates in New York and Philadelphia, will be held on Oct. 7. The second, on Oct. 14, will be sponsored by the ABC affiliates in New York and Philadelphia and the League of Women Voters. The third debate will be broadcast on WKXW, 101.5 FM, on Oct. 11 or Oct. 17.DAVID W. CHEN and JENNIFER MEDINAMr. Spitzer may be 50-some percentage points ahead in the polls in the last weeks of the New York governor’s race, but the constant attacks from his opponent, Mr. Faso, appear to be getting under the attorney general’s skin.On Thursday, the two addressed the Business Council of New York State in Bolton Landing, in the Adirondacks.In his speech, Mr. Faso called some of Mr. Spitzer’s highest-profile cases “phony.” Afterward, Mr. Faso, below, told reporters that in the fraud case against the former chief executive of A.I.G., Maurice R. Greenberg, Mr. Spitzer “violated his ethical responsibility as an attorney” by discussing the matter last year before any civil or criminal charges had been brought against Mr. Greenberg or the insurance company.Mr. Spitzer’s office later called the comment “badly misinformed” and noted that A.I.G. had paid $1.6 billion to settle the case.When Mr. Spitzer prepared to address the business leaders, the Faso attack still seemed to be ringing in his ears.Seeing that Mr. Faso had sat down to listen to his speech, Mr. Spitzer said: “Thanks for sticking around. I know you’re going to be taking notes on some wise policy additions to your campaign in the next few minutes. Won’t be anything phony about this speech, John, trust me.” DANNY HAKIM'"
"'06-09-25,'1','Congress still has done nothing to protect Americans from a terrorist attack on chemical plants. Republican leaders want to give the impression that that has changed. But voters should not fall for the spin. If the leadership goes through with the strategy it seems to have adopted last week to secure these highly vulnerable targets, national security will be the loser.The federal government is spending extraordinary amounts of money and time protecting air travel from terrorist attacks. But Congress has not yet passed a law to secure the nation’s chemical plants, even though an attack on just one plant could kill or injure as many as 100,000 people. The sticking point has been the chemical industry, a heavy contributor to political campaigns, which does not want to pay the cost of reasonable safety measures.The Senate and the House spent many months carefully developing bipartisan chemical plant security bills. Both measures were far too weak, but they would have finally imposed real safety requirements on the chemical industry. The Republican leadership in Congress blocked both bills from moving forward. Instead, whatever gets done about chemical plant security will apparently be decided behind closed doors, and inserted as a rider to a Department of Homeland Security appropriations bill.It is outrageous that something as important as chemical plant security is being decided in a back-room deal. It is regrettable that Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, the chairwoman of the committee that produced the Senate bill, does not carry enough influence with her own party’s leadership to get a strong chemical plant security bill passed. The deal itself, the likely details of which have emerged in recent days, is a near-complete cave-in to industry, and yet more proof that when it comes to a choice between homeland security and the desires of corporate America, the Republican leadership always goes with big business.Any federal chemical plant law should make it clear that states have the right to impose stricter requirements to protect their citizens from harm. The Senate and House bills said this, but the rider apparently will not. A reasonable law would make it clear that the secretary of homeland security can order chemical plants to adopt specific safety measures, like replacing highly dangerous chemicals with ones that pose less of a danger to people in the surrounding area. The House bill did this, but the rider apparently will not give the secretary this basic power.It is likely that the backroom deal will also exempt water treatment and drinking water facilities from regulation, meaning that millions of Americans could needlessly be put at risk of an attack on a chlorine tank, and that it will make the rules about when and how chemical plants must submit safety plans hopelessly vague.'"
"'06-09-25,'1','Armin Jordan, the Swiss conductor, died on Wednesday in Zurich. He was 74.He died in his sleep in a hospital, according to a statement by the Orchestre de la Suisse Romande.Mr. Jordan had collapsed last Friday while conducting Prokofiev’s opera “The Love for Three Oranges” at the opera house in Basel.Mr. Jordan was a rare breed: an international conductor who spent the majority of his career conducting in his native Switzerland and in France. His best-known association was with the Orchestre de la Suisse Romande, based in Geneva, where he was music director for 12 years, from 1985 to 1997. He did not make his North American debut until 1985, when he led several performances of Wagner’s “Walküre” in Seattle; in 1991 and 1994, he appeared at the Mostly Mozart festival in New York.French music, and Mozart, were specialties — he deliberately followed in the footsteps of another major Swiss conductor of a previous generation, Ernst Ansermet — but he was perhaps better known in the United States for the operas of Wagner, which he conducted from Seattle to Paris.Mr. Jordan was a large man, with a slab of a face and a full mouth, often twisted in a sardonic smile, and his powerful physical presence belied the careful near-understatement of his conducting. Some listeners read this quality as the lack of a distinct profile, but many admired it for its elegance and subtlety.“Mr. Jordan conducted a spacious and tellingly shaped performance,” Anthony Tommasini wrote in The New York Times in 1998 of the “Tristan and Isolde” he led in Seattle. In The Boston Globe, Richard Dyer wrote of the same performance that Mr. Jordan’s Wagner “is not for those who like their Wagner loud and weighty with portent,” and added that he “secured an unusual degree of flexibility and conversational intimacy, all subsumed in a long line that never faltered.”'"
"'06-09-25,'1','What, other than a bit of envy, does this have to do with the French? The posters include a tagline stating that the advertised “products” are “produit en Italie.” Yes, that’s French for “made in Italy,” a sly nudge unlikely to be lost on either country.Another poster makes a more pointed reference to the most-discussed event of that evening in Berlin, depicting Mr. Materazzi in the shape of an armoire, as a stylized representation of a fictional furniture brand called “Armadi Materazzi.” Its slogan: “Solidità mondiale testata a prova di testate” (“World-class solidity, proven to be head-butt-proof”).Carlo Cavallone, a copywriter at Wieden & Kennedy in Amsterdam, the agency that created the campaign for Nike, said the ads were intended to “rub it in a bit, but without being chauvinistic.”After a match-fixing scandal that resulted in stiff penalties for top Italian teams like Juventus of Turin and A.C. Milan, many Italians want to look to the national team as a source of pride. While such sentiment has sometimes been harnessed by political elements in Italy, Mr. Cavallone said that the campaign was an effort to restore pride in the team to what he saw as a more appropriate playing field.“A lot of people in Italy don’t say ‘Forza Italia’ at football matches anymore,” Mr. Cavallone said, since the previous government of Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi adopted the “Go, Italy” cheer as the name of his political party.The campaign, which ostensibly promotes a new line of Nike soccer shoes — yes, made in Italy — will also include television spots. While Mr. Cavallone said there were no plans to run the ads outside Italy, Azzurri fans elsewhere will be able to view and order the posters on the Internet, he added.Web users can also watch a “viral” advertisement that further milks the Materazzi-Zidane incident. The video, created by the London office of the Nitro Group advertising agency, shows Mr. Materazzi rebuffing a series of attacks on his chest from a bowling ball, an American football player, even a racing pickup truck, before waving his arm in dismissal after dodging a wrecking ball.While scores of unauthorized viral videos on the Web have spoofed the famous head butt, this is the first to be endorsed by Nike, as part of a campaign for a line of sports underwear.“It was done as a bit of fun,” said Charlie Brooks, a spokesman for Nike in London.Except, perhaps, for the French.'"
"'06-09-25,'1','While the episode is one more example of Creative Artists’ aggressive acquisition of Hollywood talent, the shift in the comedy arena is also part of a broader tectonic movement going on in the entertainment industry. Studios have cracked down on the prices they are willing to pay for top performers and have reduced the overall number of films they make and release.In particular, the studios began balking at the budgets of recent comedies and at the percentage of gross revenue they were expected to pay. In May, Fox pulled the plug on “Used Guys,” a futuristic comedy starring Ben Stiller and Jim Carrey, to be directed by Jay Roach, saying that the $112 million budget and back-end revenue deals were too high.Shortly thereafter, another star vehicle for Mr. Carrey, “Ripley’s Believe It or Not,” was suspended at Paramount, when the studio protested as the budget climbed over $150 million and the star demanded changes to the script.“Right now the whole business is in this cloud of change, and we’re all just trying to figure it out,” Mr. Gold said in an interview. “On the one hand it’s exciting, and rife with opportunity. But it’s a disruptive thing. And people are scared, and the studios are a little lost, and everyone is a little lost.”Until recently, the artists in the Gold/Miller Company, part of Mosaic Media, and the United Talent comedy stables had been largely protected from those pressures. What the agents and managers sometimes called a “wheel of comedy” successfully built actors into $20 million stars, including Mr. Carrey, then Mr. Ferrell and now Mr. Vaughn, and was responsible for many of the blockbuster comedies made in Hollywood over the last several years.This summer alone, those movies included “The Break-Up,” the romantic comedy developed by Mr. Vaughn, who starred in the film; “Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby,” a Nascar comedy starring Mr. Ferrell and written by him and Mr. McKay; “Nacho Libre” starring Mr. Black and co-produced by him, and “You, Me and Dupree,” starring Owen Wilson and co-produced by him.Mr. Miller goes back with Mr. Carrey all the way to his days as a struggling stand-up comedian when Mr. Miller would signal music cues from the side of the stage. Mr. Gold, who represented the Wayans brothers, met Mr. Carrey through the Wayans’ hit show “In Living Color,” and soon became his co-manager. They took Mr. Carrey to Mr. Stevens in the early 1990’s, when the United Talent Agency was in its infancy. With the addition of the prolific Mr. Stiller and his many collaborators, the comedy network grew to include many of Hollywood’s most recognizable figures, who generated their own material and starred in, co-wrote and co-produced each other’s movies.That network gave United Talent and Gold/Miller enormous leverage. Mr. Miller, in particular, did not hesitate to wield the clout of his clients. He sometimes angered his studio counterparts by suggesting, for example, that his star would be unavailable for promotional appearances unless a script change was made, according to executives who worked with him. And projects were often take-it-or-leave-it packages.Recently, some studios decided to leave it, embarrassing some United Talent clients. “Used Guys,” starring Mr. Stiller and Mr. Carrey, was just weeks away from shooting in Arizona when the decision was made, and Mr. Carrey was angered by the negative publicity surrounding the shutdown. This month, Fox bought the rights to the “Used Guys” script, but did not tell Mr. Miller or his client, Mr. Roach. Instead the agent for the screenwriter of “Used Guys,” Caren Bohrman, had to tell Mr. Roach and Mr. Miller about having sold the rights to Fox, after they inquired repeatedly about doing so.“They were devastated” to learn the script had been bought by Fox, said Ms. Bohrman. “I believe Jay is really upset, and I’m sorry for that.”Mr. Carrey was also at odds with the director Tim Burton over the script of “Ripley’s Believe It or Not.” When Paramount suspended the project, Mr. Burton decided to shoot “Sweeney Todd” instead; executives close to the “Ripley” project said Mr. Carrey and Mr. Burton were trying to work out their differences.Mr. Carrey gave no specific reason for defecting to Creative Artists after so many years with Mr. Stevens, but Mr. Gold said it was the star’s decision alone. “Jim Carrey isn’t a robot that we tell him what to do,” he said. “He’s well informed. He has opinions, eyes that watch, ears that listen.”Jim Berkus, chairman of United Talent, agreed that losing Mr. Carrey was a fork in the road of sorts.“He’s in our DNA,” he said. “We look at him as a founding member of the company. As he grew, we grew. It was a very productive, heartfelt, close collaborative relationship between Nick and Jim, and U.T.A. and Jim. We did a lot of big things together, made a lot of big deals, dodged a lot of icebergs.”Mr. Stevens declined to comment for this story. The agent, who lives just a block from Mr. Carrey and would commonly greet the star with an exuberant, “Jimmy G!” when he called, is said to be embarrassed and angry at the end of their relationship.Mr. Gold has signed with Creative Artists as a client, and is seeking to raise money to finance and produce movies, while Mr. Miller, who declined to comment, is pursuing a separate path as a producer, while continuing to manage the careers of his clients. Mr. Gold described his feelings for his former partner as, “I love him and I hate him, all in the same hour.”As for the partnership over Mr. Carrey with Mr. Stevens, he said, “We were the guys who went from ‘In Living Color,’ to ride him to the biggest deal ever made at the time, to the mix of movies he’s been in. Here it is coming to an end. It’s sad.”Mary Parent, a producer at Universal Pictures, said the breakup would not necessarily affect the movies that got made. “It’s like a divorce with people who have kids,” she said. “You figure out how to work with each other, for the kids’ sake. They’re all smart and know their core business. They’ll always do what’s best for their clients.”Another thing that apparently hasn’t changed is the price tags of comedies. At Universal, “Evan Almighty,” the sequel to the Jim Carrey comedy “Bruce Almighty,” has soared far over budget to $175 million, according to executives close to the film, although the studio will not confirm that figure. And at Fox, “Night at the Museum,” starring Mr. Stiller, is so far costing close to $120 million, according to an executive close to the production.'"

"'06-09-25,'1','In 1972, Bobby Fischer lost the first game of his match with Boris Spassky, then forfeited the second. Mr. Fischer stormed back to win three of the next four games, taking a lead he never relinquished on his way to the title.In Game 2, Mr. Kramnik chose the Slav Defense, a bread-and-butter opening for tournament players of all levels that it is known to be solid and hard to crack. Through 16 f4, the game followed a familiar path; at this point, Black often plays 16 ... Rc8 to get queenside counterplay started, retreats the knight with 16 ... Nf8 to provide additional protection for the king, or attacks White’s advanced knight with 16 ... Be7. Mr. Kramnik’s decision to exchange light-squared bishops with 16 ... Bd3 was new and seemed ill advised, as it only accelerated White’s attack by putting the queen on the useful b1-h7 diagonal.After 20 g4, Black could have attacked White’s knight with 20 ...h6, but then 21 Ne6 Re6 22 gf Re7 23 f6 gf 24 Rg1 Kh8 25 f5 yields White a dangerous attack. Also, 20 ...fg could be met by 21 f5 Be7 22 Ne6 Ne6 23 fe, when once again White is making inroads to Black’s king.Mr. Kramnik, true to his style, tried to avoid complications by playing 20 ... Qd7, but Mr. Topalov was soon throwing everything he had at Black’s king.On 28 ... Rb2, Mr. Topalov offered up his queen with 29 hg. It would have been suicide to accept; after 29 ... Rc2 30 gh Kh7 31 Rg7 and Black’s king is in a mating net.Under pressure, Mr. Kramnik made a grave error with 31 ... Bf8. He should have played 31 ... Kf8; even though Black is worse after 32 Qg6 Qe2 33 Qh6 Kf7 34 Qh5 Kf8 35 Qg4 Bg5 36 Re1 Qc2 37 Qg5, there is still plenty to play for.Instead, 31 ... Bf8 should have led to immediate catastrophe after 32 Rg4 Bg7 33 Qc7, when the best Black can do is 33 ... Qf1 34 Ng1 Qg2 35 Rg2 Rg2 36 Kg2 and Black can resign. But Mr. Topalov let Mr. Kramnik off the hook with 32 Qg6.Perhaps unhinged by his oversight, Mr. Topalov began to make mistakes. Instead of 36 Rc1, which led to a trade of rooks — an attacking player should rarely allow a trade — Mr. Topalov could have played 36 Qh5, keeping the pressure on Black. Then 36 ... Qe3 is not good because of 37 Ng5, while 36 ... a5 is met by 37 Rg3 and White begins to reorganize his pieces for the attack.After the queens were traded, Mr. Topalov erred with 42 Bg5, overlooking how quick Black’s a pawn was. Instead, 42 Ng5 would have preserved enough drawing chances.Given a final chance, Mr. Kramnik displayed excellent technique in the endgame.At this point, Mr. Topalov should be heartened by knowing that he has played better than Mr. Kramnik and therefore has little to fear. Or his errors could weigh on him, sapping his confidence.He has a rest day to contemplate what has happened. The owner of the pavilion where Mr. Topalov is staying may want to check his insurance policy on the sticks of furniture in the bedroom.'"

"'06-09-26,'1','The top stories in Russian newspapers on Tuesday.The price of oil has dropped to its lowest level in 10 months, causing the Russian stock market to fall sharply, the major newspapers report. According to Nezavisimaya Gazeta, oil fell below $60 a barrel on Monday, a major decrease from the $77 per barrel recorded in July. The fall in price caused a corresponding decline, by 3.5 percent, of the Russian stock market on Monday for a total decrease of 8 percent in the last four days, writes Vedomosti. According to the investment firm Troika Dialogue, energy companies make up nearly 55 percent of the Russian market, reports Kommersant. The newspaper writes that brokers do not yet expect the decline in stock prices to subside, though they are not yet at the point of panic. According to Vedomosti, some analysts are certain that stock prices will increase to levels higher by the end of this year. The newspaper says that the Russian index rose by more than 25 percent since the beginning of the year, though oil is already cheaper than it was in January.A number of factors may have contributed to the drop in oil prices. Vedomosti writes that an analyst from Troika Dialogue blamed an announcement that BP plans to suspend oil extraction in Alaska because of an accident there. The analyst also points to the situation in Iran as a cause. Nezavisimaya Gazeta clarifies that an announcement by Iran’s president that he is prepared for negotiations over his country’s nuclear program may have caused the price to fall. Another analyst quoted by Nezavisimaya Gazeta blames the failure by the United States to restrict oil drilling in the Gulf of Mexico.There are worries that a sharp decrease in oil prices could lead to budgetary problems, Nezavisimaya Gazeta writes. According to Aleksei Kudrin, Russia’s finance minister, the country’s budget is based on an average yearly price of $61 a barrel, the newspaper reports. A representative from the finance ministry said that even if the price continues to drop, Russia has invested sufficiently to avoid major economic problems. Other analysts warn, however, that a sharp fall in the global oil price could lead to a drop in investment and slow the strengthening of the ruble, Nezavisimaya Gazeta says.NATIONAL BOLSHEVIKS RAID MINISTRY OF FINANCE — About 40 members of the National Bolshevik Party occupied the Ministry of Finance building on Monday, demanding that Russia citizens be returned bank deposits supposedly lost between 1991 and 1992. Ministry guards were only able to stop journalists, who were trailing the activists, from entering the building. Two busloads of riot troops were eventually called in and all the protesters were detained.ANGRY INVESTORS START HUNGER STRIKE — In Moscow on Monday, about 60 people barricaded themselves inside an unfinished office complex in which they had invested and began a hunger strike. The protesters said that they would not leave the building until federal authorities take up their case. Similar protests have been initiated in at least four other cities, all coordinated by the organization Social Initiative, which seeks to protect investors’ rights.FOREIGN STUDENTS PROTEST AFTER MURDER — Responding to the recent murder of an Indian student, foreign students in St. Petersburg held a protest on Monday demanding that the authorities guarantee their security. Police provided protection for a sanctioned protest by the nationalist Movement Against Illegal Immigration on Sunday, the same day that the Indian student was stabbed. The regional prosecutor’s office suspects that a group of perhaps four people attacked the student.'"
"'06-09-26,'1','""If they hold on to power,"" Mr. Abhisit said, ""it will be the opposite of what was announced and we hope that it will not happen.""General Sonthi said the martial law he imposed when he seized power would remain in effect until the situation is stable. One indication of his concern was a decree issued Sunday that banned political activity or meetings in the rural areas that are Thaksin’s base.At the time of the coup, the military was split between officers supporting or opposing Thaksin Shinawatra, the ousted prime minister. During his five years in power Mr. Thaksin had put loyalists in control of almost every sector of government and region of the country.""Let us not forget that Mr.Thaksin, although out of power for now, has not thrown in the towel yet,"" wrote Veera Prateepchaikul, deputy editor-in-chief of The Bangkok Post daily newspaper, in a column. ""He is still very much loved by the grassroots population and has built up a nuge network of support over the years.""Some Thai newspaper commentators are saying it does not appear that the junta had thoroughly prepared the steps to be taken after its seizure of power.The military leaders are being criticized for their decision not to immediately freeze the assets of Mr. Thaksin and his associates, for appointing some figures associated with Mr. Thaksin to key positions and for failing to make policy statements on important national issues apart from security.A small anti-coup movement has begun, and political analysts say it could swell into a larger problem for the junta if the military does not quickly replace itself with a civilian administration.A group of civil society groups calling itself the N.G.O.’s Network for Political and Social Reform urged the junta today to withdraw its restrictions on free assembly and free press; to restore the constitution, particularly its articles on civil rights; and to appoint officials who are free of corruption and have no ties to the Mr. Thaksin government.Chaiwat Satha-anand, a political scientist at Thammasat University, said he understood the reasons for ousting Mr. Thaksin but he said he was disturbed by its broad and immediate acceptance by the public.""It is sad to see how popular this coup has become because accepting violent situations to political problems could also be seen as a sign of despair,"" he wrote in a column in the Bangkok Post.In its report on the selection of a prime minister The Nation daily newspaper said Mr. Supachai had tentatively accepted an offer to lead the interim government.Mr. Supachai, who is now head of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development in Geneva, has held a number of financial posts in the Thai government, including that of commerce minister after the Asian financial crisis in 1997.Under the junta’s plan, the interim prime minister would hold office during the year-long drafting of a new constitution and preparations for a parliamentary election that would restore democracy.""I have someone in mind but would rather not say it at this time,"" General Sonthi said. ""I will try to pick a prime minister as soon as possible.""He said he would name a civilian who would be free to make his own decisions and appoint his own 35-member cabinet. But he said his definition of a civilian prime minister included former members of the military.General Sonthi said the military rulers had been in touch with Mr. Thaksin, who is now in London, and that as a Thai citizen he was free to return whenever he wants.""But I think Mr. Thaksin can decide for himself,"" General Sonthi said. ""I think Mr. Thakskin may not come right now because he can see the situation is unstable.""Investigations have begun into the assets of Mr. Thaksin and his associates and into possible government corruption and these could affect his decision whether to return.A nine-member investigating committee was formed Sunday and its chairman, Sawat Chotiphanit, said, ""If we find evidence that they tried to transfer their assets overseas we will freeze the assets.""As it prepares to settle in for the long term, General Sonthi said the junta, which had insisted on being called the Council for Democratic Reform under Constitutional Monarchy, was renaming itself the National Security Council.'"
"'06-09-26,'1','Torre indicated after the game that Johnson would move back in the playoff rotation to start Game 3, on 12 days’ rest. Chien-Ming Wang is lined up to start in the opener Oct. 3, followed by Mike Mussina.Jaret Wright, who tossed six strong innings Monday, is Torre’s preference to start a possible fourth game, though Torre said he would also consider Cory Lidle, who starts Tuesday at Yankee Stadium against Baltimore.Johnson had been scheduled to start Thursday, and he will miss a start for only the second time in two years with the Yankees. That durability is important to Johnson, who turned 43 on Sept. 10.“To think that I’ve made essentially every start since I’ve been a Yankee, at 43, says enough right there,” Johnson said last week in Toronto. “I’m proud of that.”But Johnson saw no reason to push himself after a disjointed outing here Saturday. That night, he retired his first seven hitters but ended up allowing five runs and seven hits in six innings. He has allowed five runs in three consecutive starts for the first time since late in the 1991 season.“It’s not that big of a deal,” Johnson said Monday. “The last couple of starts, I was fine. This start, it just bothered me. So we’re just getting the treatment, doing things accordingly and maybe the time off will help.”Johnson finished the regular season 17-11 with a 5.00 earned run average. He exceeded 200 innings for the 14th time in his career.The news about Johnson comes precisely as another future Hall of Fame pitcher is regaining his health. Closer Mariano Rivera worked a scoreless seventh inning Monday, throwing 9 of his first 10 pitches for strikes.It was Rivera’s second appearance this series after missing the first three weeks of September with a muscle strain near his right elbow.“It looked good today,” Rivera said. “It looked much better today. I felt real good. Everything is in place where it should be.”Rivera took 21 days to rest his arm, and with the playoffs approaching, Johnson will have much less time to rest his back. Under the circumstances, Rivera said, Johnson was being smart.“Randy is a veteran,” Rivera said. “He knows how to control his body. If it’s something he can manage, I think he will do the right thing. Missing his next start to get ready for the playoffs, I think, is the right thing to do.”Bobby Abreu and Hideki Matsui led the Yankees’ offense Monday, each hitting a three-run homer against Jae Seo in the first inning. Abreu finished with four hits, Matsui with three.Matsui’s home run came on the 14th pitch of his at-bat, which included the ejection of the Tampa Bay pitching coach, Mike Butcher, and Manager Joe Maddon for arguing balls and strikes.The Yankees’ 6-0 lead in the first inning was plenty for Wright, who allowed five hits and four walks. Though Torre would not commit to starting Wright in the playoffs, it was telling that he used Jorge Posada as the starting catcher.Torre saidd that although Sal Fasano had caught Wright recently, Posada would do so in the playoffs, and he wanted the two to work together.If Wright starts in the playoffs, he would pitch on the road and follow Johnson. That is assuming Johnson is healthy enough to pitch, an assumption the Yankees are making for now.“I’ve been on teams when you clinched and got everybody healthy,” Wright said. “If that’s what it takes, I know he wants to be out there and I think he’s going to be fine.”Kyle Farnsworth, who had tightness in his back and could not pitch Friday, worked a scoreless ninth in his first appearance in six days. ... Hideki Matsui will return to left field Tuesday, Joe Torre said, his first appearance there since breaking his left wrist May 11. Torre wanted to keep Matsui from playing left field on artificial turf this trip, but he said he would not hesitate to use Matsui on turf in Minnesota if the Yankees play the Twins in the playoffs. ... Robinson Canó qualified for the A.L. batting race with his fourth plate appearance. He went 2 for 4 and is second in the league with a .342 average. Minnesota’s Joe Maurer leads at .349. ... Torre said Andy Phillips was his best defensive first baseman off the bench, a possible hint that Phillips could make the postseason roster. ... The San Francisco Giants confirmed Monday that they would play host to the Yankees during interleague play next season. The Yankees will play at AT&T Park from June 22 to June 24 for their first trip there in the regular season. After next season, the Yankees will have played regular-season games in every National League city except Houston and Pittsburgh. ... Torre and his wife, Ali, will make an appearance in White Plains on Tuesday to announce the opening of four “safe rooms” at schools in Westchester County. The rooms will give students a place to meet with counselors trained in domestic-violence intervention and prevention, the core issue of the Torres’ Safe at Home Foundation.'"
"'06-09-26,'1','Federal District Court in Manhattan has made public an affidavit from a plaintiff whose identity cannot be revealed. In the affidavit, he says he has to lie to those close to him to preserve the secrecy of a national security investigation that he believes is morally questionable.The affidavit, which has been heavily censored, provides vivid details of an upside-down life. The plaintiff, identified only as John Doe, is a businessman who filed a lawsuit in 2004 challenging the constitutionality of federal demands for Internet and telephone records. He describes himself as the former president of an Internet access and consulting business.Some time ago (the government will not allow him to say when), he received a so-called national security letter from the F.B.I., asking him to provide information about one of his clients in connection with “international terrorism or clandestine intelligence activities.” The letter also said he was prohibited from talking with anyone about the investigation.“Since that time,” the John Doe affidavit says, “I have been subject to a gag order that has prevented me from disclosing, among many other things, that I initiated this lawsuit.”Mr. Doe said he resisted the government’s demand because he did not want to violate the privacy of his clients. In April 2004, represented by the American Civil Liberties Union, he filed a lawsuit against the attorney general, John Ashcroft, and Robert S. Mueller, the director of the F.B.I. The government gained the right to demand customer information without a court order under a 1986 law, which was expanded by the U.S.A.

"'06-09-26,'1','JERUSALEM, Sept. 25 — An Israeli newspaper reported Monday that Prime Minister Ehud Olmert held a secret meeting about 10 days ago with a senior Saudi Arabian official to discuss issues that included Iran’s nuclear program and prospects for Israeli-Palestinian negotiations.In response to the reports, Mr. Olmert and his aides said he did not meet with King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia. However, they declined to answer directly when asked if he met with any other senior Saudi leader.“I did not meet with the Saudi king and I did not meet with anyone who should cause a sensation in the media,” Mr. Olmert was quoted as saying on Ynetnews.com, a Web site affiliated with Yediot Aharonot, the Israeli newspaper that first carried the story.If a meeting did take place, it would indicate a significant development for two countries that have never had diplomatic ties. Officials from Israel and Saudi Arabia have quietly shared intelligence information, but have never met publicly, said David Kimche, chief of the Israel Council on Foreign Relations.Both countries are concerned about Iran and its nuclear program, and — with a majority of Saudi Arabia’s Muslims being Sunnis — are also concerned about links between Shiite Muslim groups stretching from Iran to Lebanon, he said.'"
"'06-09-26,'1','Real estate experts say the rising premiums have contributed to the fall in housing prices, which are also under pressure from rising mortgage rates and the inevitable cooling of a too-hot market.“In the South, the insurance issue is having a meaningful negative impact on sales,’’ said David Lereah, chief economist for the National Association of Realtors. “It is less meaningful up the coast to the north, but insurance is definitely becoming a factor in sales there, too.”The shock of higher premiums is being felt by people like Walker and Shirley Totty, who have lived for 11 years in a 36-unit building here overlooking a white-sand beach on Alabama’s small stretch of Gulf Coast.Mr. Totty, a retired manager of an auto repair and tire store in Birmingham, said the insurance premium for his building had jumped more than 12-fold, to $429,182 annually this year, from $34,790 in 2005.His share of the new bill — about $11,000, up from about $900 — has created such a hole in his budget that he is trying to sell his condominium and move inland.“If I stay here, I’m going to run out of money,” he said.Not long ago, finding a buyer for an apartment on the Alabama coast, a popular area for second-home buyers, would have been easy. But Mr. Totty’s property has been on the market at a price of $565,000 for three months and no one has even inquired about it.“The market is full of fear because of the storms,’’ said Larry Powell, a broker at Meyer Real Estate in Gulf Shores, Ala. “When you start seeing the cost of insurance in the range we’re seeing it, you start thinking: Is it worth it? Can I afford to be here?’’Farther north, insurance coverage costs have not risen so sharply, but coastal homeowners are paying for heightened hurricane fears another way. On Cape Cod and Long Island, for example, owners have been forced to take on a much larger share of the risk of hurricane damage through higher deductibles.Mike Chapman, sales chief in Boston for Hub International, a national insurance broker, said that premiums on many condos on Cape Cod had doubled or tripled. Deductibles, in some cases, jumped to $125,000 from $5,000.On Long Island, Alex M. Seaman, another Hub International broker, said prices were up 20 percent to 50 percent. For one condo building, he said, the annual premium had risen to $175,000, from $120,000, and the deductible increased to $50,000, from $2,500.The higher insurance rates are also scaring off real estate investors, who generally do not plan to live in the apartments they buy. Typically, their strategy has been to rent the apartment for most of the year to cover mortgage payments and other fees, perhaps use it for a few weeks of vacation, and then sell it for much more than they paid.But the higher insurance costs have forced investors to redo their back-of-the-envelope math. And for many, the numbers are not adding up.“People were buying condos with the idea of ‘cash flowing’ them — having them pay for themselves with rental income,” said Kay Stephenson, a broker at Crump Insurance Services in Atlanta. “But now you have the cost of insurance and you have to increase the cost of the rental, and people are just not able to do it.”Here in Orange Beach, a resort community with a condominium-lined beach, and in its almost identical twin, Gulf Shores — both directly in the path of Hurricane Ivan in 2004 — it is impossible to tease out precisely the degree to which insurance costs have hurt sales. But they have clearly been a factor.Condo sales are down 71 percent in Orange Beach during the first eight months of 2006 compared with the similar period last year, down 58 percent in Gulf Shores and down 84 percent in Fort Morgan, a smaller beach town just west of Gulf Shores. That compares with a 10.5 percent drop in condo sales around the country and about the same in the South as a whole, according to the National Association of Realtors.In Florida, sales of individual homes have declined an average of 33 percent, and condominium sales are down 37 percent statewide. But in the cities of Daytona Beach and Naples, condo sales are down more than 50 percent from last year.“Insurance is killing us,’’ said Michael Dooley, president of the Florida Association of Realtors. The effect of higher premiums “has stepped up big time in the last few months.”Mr. Dooley, the managing broker of Illustrated Properties in Hobe Sound, Fla., north of West Palm Beach, said one customer for a $1 million home on a canal near the beach “walked away from the transaction and a $6,000 deposit when he found out what the insurance premium was going to be.”The policy on Mr. Dooley’s own waterfront home is up for renewal in February and his agent has told him the annual premium will be $10,600, compared with $5,500 last year.Given the long-term predictions of more and stronger hurricanes in coming decades — based on cyclical patterns of ocean currents and, to some extent, global warming — many insurance experts say they expect the new, higher rates to become the norm, rather than the exception, even if no major storms occur in the next year or two.“I don’t think the price is going to go come down quickly, no matter what happens,” said Ed Kiessling, a senior executive at Frank Crystal & Company, a national insurance brokerage firm based in New York.There are no real alternatives for homeowners. Policy makers in Washington have begun debating whether the federal government should share some of the burden of coverage for many kinds of disasters — not just hurricanes, but also tornadoes, wildfires and earthquakes — as it does now in terrorist attacks. But the industry is divided on whether to cede some of its risks and potential profits to the government, and Congress is far from voting on the issue, industry specialists say.In Alabama and other areas in hurricane territory, some condo owners have discussed pooling their money to insure themselves, but have found that raising such a fund can be even more painful than paying high premiums to insurers.While premiums on the houses of individuals have doubled or tripled, real estate and insurance people say the cost of coverage has risen much more steeply for condominium complexes, in part because their value routinely runs to the tens of millions of dollars and they represent a much higher concentration of risk for insurers than single-family homes do.Daniel Craven, a lawyer who represents more than 100 condo owners’ associations in Orange Beach and Gulf Shores, said that premium increases were steepest on homes and apartment buildings built with wood, because they typically suffer the greatest damage in a storm.For concrete and steel buildings set on deep pilings, with lower floors used only for parking, insurance rates have generally doubled or tripled at the Alabama beaches.The last time homeowners experienced so steep a jump in insurance prices was in 1992, when premiums tripled or quadrupled in Florida after Hurricane Andrew tore across the state south of Miami. To win the approval of regulators for such increases in Florida and a few other states, the insurers told regulators that they had taken steps to avoid similar price shocks in the future, according to J. Robert Hunter, who served as commissioner of insurance in Texas in 1993 and 1994 and is now director of insurance for the Consumer Federation of America.“They’re either gouging now or they used erroneous assumptions then,’’ Mr. Hunter said.At Fitch Ratings, which tracks the financial strength of companies, Jim Auden, a senior manager, said, “They’re trying to price to make an adequate profit.’’In 2005, the property and casualty industry reported an overall profit of $43.2 billion. Home insurers, despite their heavy losses along the coasts, reported slightly better than break-even returns for the year because of investment gains and profits elsewhere in the country.So far, there have been no major hurricanes this year, and Mr. Hunter said that if the season ended quietly, “You’re going to see such obscene profits, it’s going to be shocking.’’In the meantime, John Miller is giving up on coastal living. After 15 years in Florida, Mr. Miller, a building contractor, has bought a house in the Carolinas and plans to move as soon as he can sell his house in Hobe Sound, near the Intercoastal Waterway. He said he was moving because of an accumulation of problems, including having to cope with more frequent hurricanes.But, he added, about 60 percent of the reason was insurance. “You get sick of all this,” Mr. Miller said.'"
"'06-09-26,'1','Revlon is cutting 250 jobs, or 8 percent of its work force, and canceling its recently introduced Vital Radiance cosmetics line aimed at older women in an overhaul effort to try to make the company profitable.The steps announced yesterday came a week after Revlon, which is controlled by the financier Ronald O. Perelman, ousted its president and chief executive, Jack L. Stahl, and replaced him with the chief financial officer, David L. Kennedy.Revlon also announced that it expected losses in the third quarter and for the year, causing its shares to drop 12 percent, or 15 cents, to $1.09.Revlon, which has struggled with debt and increased competition from rivals, had counted on Vital Radiance to help reverse its fortunes. But results for the brand, which appeared on retailer’s shelves early this year, were disappointing.The overhaul, the second cost-cutting effort in seven months, includes eliminating some senior executive positions and consolidating operations.For the third quarter, Revlon said it expected a loss of $135 million and net sales of $280 million to $290 million. For the full year, the operating loss is expected to be approximately $45 million to $55 million, reflecting the impact of the overhaul moves and the costs of discontinuing Vital Radiance.'"
"'06-09-26,'1','The net number of long contracts, not including options, held by noncommercial buyers — bets that the price of crude oil will increase — is 22,000, down from 83,000 on Aug. 15, according to an analysis by PFC Energy of the most recent report from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. “It is a huge reversal in position,” said David Kirsch, an oil markets analyst with PFC in Washington.Kamal Murari, global head of energy marketing for Dresdner Kleinwort, said: “The move down that’s taken place has been sharp and sudden. The fact that it’s moved as significantly as it has means that any forced liquidation has been mostly priced into the market,” he said. Some of the selling in the oil market may be linked to the recent well-publicized losses in the natural gas markets, Mr. Murari said, as some funds may have been forced to liquidate assets across energy. Most market participants think OPEC will be concerned enough to take steps to stem further declines if the prices fall to $55 a barrel, he said.The members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, or OPEC, have been in contact by telephone since their last meeting on Sept. 11 to discuss falling prices but have no plans for an emergency meeting on the subject, a spokesman said on Monday. Questions about the future growth of the United States economy are also pushing investors out of the oil market. American consumers are often referred to by economists as the engine that drives the world’s markets, and when they stop spending, other economies are affected. United States home prices are cooling down, giving consumers less confidence and stripping them of paper gains.In the United States, market experts estimate that the falling oil prices will help soften the effect of the weakening housing market. “The sudden change in oil price direction in the last month has reduced the total cost of oil to the United States economy by $40 billion a year,” said Lawrence J. Goldstein, the president of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation. The fall in oil prices has added back one-quarter to one-half of a point of growth to the United States gross domestic product, Mr. Goldstein estimates.The immediate impact of lower oil prices in Europe is bound to be muted unless a sustained decline becomes apparent, economists said. At the pump, prices tend to fluctuate less in Europe than in the United States in large part because of heavy excise taxes.While prices were on their way up, it made sense to adjust growth prognoses downward, though even then the European economy was proving remarkably resilient to the run-up. Now the picture is even more complex, with Europe poised to benefit from less expensive oil, but facing a slowing of its main export market, the United States.“Do you want to be nudging your forecasts upwards in Europe when the main reason is a possible slackening of demand in the United States?” said Rob Carnell, an economist at ING Baring in London. “Personally, I would not be touching them right now.”'"
"'06-09-26,'1','A judge yesterday threw out a $10 million civil assault suit that had been brought against Liza Minnelli by her estranged husband, David Gest. In the suit, Mr. Gest said that Ms. Minnelli beat him so badly during drunken rages that he had to be hospitalized. Justice Jane S. Solomon of State Supreme Court granted Ms. Minnelli’s motion to dismiss on the grounds that the entertainer’s medical expert said Mr. Gest’s headaches were caused by a type of herpes, not by beatings, and that Mr. Gest’s doctor failed to rebut that assertion. Mr. Gest’s lawyer, Lorraine Nadel, said she would appeal. She said that although Ms. Minnelli’s physician diagnosed Mr. Gest’s headaches as being caused by herpes zoster — a strain that causes shingles, not genital herpes — Mr. Gest’s doctor said he had tested negative for the virus.'"
"'06-09-26,'1','The former chief executive of one of the nation’s largest makers of paper products was sentenced yesterday in Federal District Court to 15 years in prison after being convicted last year of engineering a $300 million fraud in a fruitless bid to save the failing company from bankruptcy. The defendant, Mehdi Gabayzadeh, the former head of American Tissue Inc., based in Hauppauge, was convicted in April 2005 of all charges in an eight-count indictment, including bank and securities fraud and conspiracy, after a nine-week trial. Mr. Gabayzadeh, 61, of Great Neck, was ordered to pay $65 million in restitution and sentenced to five years’ probation after his prison term.

"'06-09-26,'1','“There’s nothing to be gained by pointing the finger, all right?” Coughlin said, providing a hint of the message he sent to Shockey after declining to discuss the content of a meeting between the two. “If you’re truly a team and you’re in it together, you win and lose together, O.K.? You don’t point a finger at anyone. When we lose, I lose. I take the responsibility for the loss. That’s my job. Everything else — if there is something that needs to be said, my door’s always open. Come on in, talk to me. I’ll be glad to talk to you.”It was the second time in the past four games that a veteran player, unprompted, had said that the team was outcoached. Tiki Barber used the term after a 23-0 playoff loss to the Carolina Panthers in January. He and Coughlin patched things up the next day as the two reviewed game tape.At the end of Coughlin’s news conference Monday, he was asked if he was surprised that two high-profile players had publicly criticized the coaching.“Am I surprised? I am surprised,” Coughlin said. “It’s extremely disappointing. What can I tell you?”Coughlin had the last word Monday, but it was Manning who had the first. As reporters poured into the locker room, looking for reaction to Shockey’s comments, the only player there was Manning.In a way, he is the anti-Shockey, usually speaking with restraint. But he invited the initial brunt of the controversy, and did not mince words.“I don’t think there was any truth to that yesterday,” Manning said. “It was nothing to do with outcoached. We were well prepared. They didn’t show us anything we hadn’t seen. We just didn’t perform well. We had the right ideas and we had the right plays to go out and execute it well, and we just didn’t do it. It had nothing to do with being outcoached.”After about 10 minutes, Shockey appeared, and the scrum moved to his locker. Manning then played down being the only player in the locker room when reporters arrived.“Yeah, I knew I was going to have to talk today and try to settle it a little bit,” Manning said. “I know I couldn’t set it straight or make things better, but just try to say what he said wasn’t true and it was a mistake by him. I think he knows that. We’ve got to put this behind us and just move on.”If leaders are defined, in part, by their willingness to answer to the public, Manning has become one. At the other end of the locker room, center Shaun O’Hara is another.“That’s the kind of character that Eli is,” O’Hara said of Manning’s willingness to address and attempt to squelch the simmering controversy. “He’s willing to stand there when things aren’t going well and say, ‘Listen, I’m going to stand up for my teammates, I’m going to stand up for my team.’ And that’s the way we want him to be and that’s the type of leader he is.”It is not known whether the controversy will, in the end, change Shockey. But it seemed to allow Manning, in his third season, to take another step forward in becoming the public face of a franchise with plenty of star players.“It’s also him saying this is my team,” O’Hara said of Manning. “And this is his team.”'"
"'06-09-26,'1','Ms. Amajan was shot as she was walking from her house up a narrow street to the main road shortly after 7 a.m., said shopkeepers in the area.A gunman shot her four times with a pistol, said Muhammad Haidar, an official who worked in her office.Her nephew, Muhammad Asif, 45, said that no one reported seeing the gunmen. “A carpenter was close to the scene and heard the shots and he called people,” he said. Her husband also heard the shooting, came out of their house and found her lying in the street, Mr. Asif said.The police were looking for two men who escaped by motorcycle, said the provincial governor, Asadullah Khaled, who went to the crime scene. The police found tracks of the motorcycle driving away from the scene, he said.Ms. Amajan preferred to take a taxi or public transport, even though her office had cars and drivers, her nephew said. “She wanted to keep a low profile,” he said. “We wanted her to come and live with us in town, but she used to say, ‘If it’s God’s will, they will take me anywhere.’ ”Mr. Haidar said that she had not received specific threats but that everyone in the office knew of the danger posed by the Taliban, who have in the past attacked teachers and government officials. In another recent high-level assassination, a suicide bomber killed the governor of Paktia Province.But to gun down a woman in the street, in this strictly conservative tribal society, is rare and shocking to many, and it has reinforced the fear in this southern city, which was once the Taliban spiritual headquarters, at the continuing violence and growing Taliban threats. A United Nations official noted that five people were kidnapped Sunday in the city.“People are scared, of course,” Mr. Haidar said. “How can we feel secure when the head of our department is killed in front of her house?”Ms. Amajan’s relatives and employees ruled out any personal enmity as a motive, saying she was a religious woman, the mother of an 18-year-old son and a person of unimpeachable character.“She was a poor woman, from a poor background and was very well connected to the local women’s networks in Kandahar,” Ms. Bachmann said. “In the south things are very difficult, and she worked to improve things for women — and she worked very well with us in the United Nations.”President Hamid Karzai, on a visit to the United States, condemned the killing. “The enemies of Afghanistan are trying to kill those people who are working for the peace and prosperity of Afghanistan,” he said in a statement released in Kabul.'"
"'06-09-26,'1','“I’d expect home sales to continue softening, but perhaps not at the dramatic pace we saw a little earlier,” said Celia Chen, director of housing economics at Moody’s Economy .com. “The markets are just very overvalued right now.’’If the sales trends are leveling off, however, prices still appear set to fall further.David A. Lereah, chief economist for the Realtors association, said the price drop was a taste of what the market should expect in the coming months. But he predicted that prices would probably improve next year.“We’re in for a ride right now,” Mr. Lereah said. “This is the first of many price corrections for the remaining months of the year — for at least the next three or four months.”Until this year, the housing sector had enjoyed a boom of more than half a decade, chalking up ever higher numbers of sales and rapidly rising prices. But it has been shrinking under the impact of rising mortgage rates and a slowing economy.As the Realtors and economists see it, falling prices may be just what the housing market needs before sales can revive again. In some regions of the country last month, sales rose where prices fell. In the Northeast, sales rose 1.9 percent as the median price fell 3.9 percent, to $271,000. In the Midwest the pattern was the same: sales were up 0.7 percent and the median price was down 1.1 percent, to $176,000.The opposite occurred in the West. While prices have held steady there this summer, sales have fallen. In August, sales dropped 2.3 percent while the median price rose 0.3 percent, to $345,000. Compared with a year earlier, sales have fallen 22.8 percent.“Something’s going to give in the West,” Mr. Lereah said. “The correction has not occurred in the West yet. Sellers are stubborn there.”In the South, sales volume in August was 0.8 percent lower than July 2006 and 7.4 percent lower than August 2005. The median existing-home price fell 2.6 percent, to $184,000, from July to August.By comparison, data from the federal government has shown prices leveling off for some time. A report from the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight released this month showed that prices nationwide increased 1.2 percent in the second quarter, the weakest gain in almost seven years.Some economists prefer the government’s price data because it tries to adjust for changes in the quality and size of homes sold from one year to the next.The Realtors association numbers do not take into account incentives by sellers, which could skew their median price numbers higher.At the end of August, there were so many unsold homes on the market that it would take seven and a half months to sell them all at the current sales pace. The association said that was the biggest backlog since April 1993.Economists said that as the number of unsold homes on the market continued to rise, sellers would have little choice but to cut prices.“With the supply of unsold homes reaching yet another record high, there is only one way this market can clear, and that is through even further price falls,” wrote Dimitry Fleming, an economist for ING Bank. For all the worries about declining prices, though, Joshua Shapiro, chief United States economist with MFR, said the price decline in August should be viewed in the context of a 111 percent increase in the median single-family home price over the last 11 years.“The underlying trend here is one of stable to modestly lower prices after the sharp gains seen for many years,” he wrote in a research note. “It should not be a huge shock that we are seeing a price correction.”'"
"'06-09-26,'1','Stocks surged yesterday, with the Nasdaq rising more than 1 percent, as oil prices and benchmark interest rates hit multimonth lows, improving the outlook for corporate profits.A smaller-than-expected drop in existing-home sales for August also helped support the market.Companies that benefit from lower borrowing costs and declining energy prices, including blue chips like Caterpillar and General Electric, led the advance.Earlier in the session, the benchmark 10-year Treasury note’s yield touched seven-month lows and crude prices fell to their lowest since March 8, before rebounding at the close.“Further decline in oil prices has helped out and interest rates have certainly come down — that is very helpful,” said Lincoln F. Anderson, chief investment officer with LPL Financial Services in Boston.The Dow Jones industrial average rose 67.71 points, or 0.59 percent, to end at 11,575.81. The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index climbed 11.59 points, or 0.88 percent, to finish at 1,326.37, its highest level in more than five years.'"
"'06-09-26,'1','Despite international quotas, the appetite for bluefin tuna is so insatiable that in the Mediterranean it is on the verge of extinction, according to the World Wildlife Fund. To curb quota violations and what the industry calls tuna laundering, Japanese officials have started carrying out DNA tests on imported bluefin tuna.The Japanese, who eat about 80 percent of the world’s bluefin tuna, are now contending with competition from, predictably, the Chinese. As Chinese in Beijing and Shanghai become sushi devotees, they are paying top dollar for bluefin. Some of the best sushi restaurants in Japan are grumbling that bluefin has become too expensive and hard to buy — and that they might scratch tuna from their menus instead of suffering the indignity of serving the cheap stuff.There is a “high possibility,” Mr. Kumai said, that in a decade or two, as China keeps getting richer, Japan may simply be priced out of a shrinking bluefin market.“Now only Chinese in the coastal areas are eating sushi, or can afford to,” Mr. Kumai said. “What happens when the Chinese in the vast hinterland start eating sushi?”As part of Japan’s national interest, and also because the Japanese have been exhausting the world’s tuna stocks, Mr. Kumai advocated the large-scale farming of bluefin tuna, led by the government.“This has to be a national project,” he said. “Now Americans and Chinese are eating sushi, so we can’t just sit back.”The outside threat has added urgency to Mr. Kumai’s work, one that he had never imagined when he began fish farming in the late 1950’s. As a boy growing up in the landlocked prefecture of Nagano, he had longed to see the ocean, but World War II restricted travel. When he finally caught a glimpse of the ocean during a junior high school trip, he was hooked.Over the years, the university’s Fisheries Laboratory was first in the captive breeding of about 20 fish species, including halibut, flat bream and Japanese amberjack. Much of the work went on here, in the placid Pacific waters between the town of Kushimoto and the small island of Oshima, where various fish are farmed inside pens.But bluefin are the main attraction. At first, capturing young bluefin in the wild and transporting them into pens proved difficult, with most of them dying in fishermen’s nets. Bluefin bruise easily because of their delicate scales, and their gills take in little oxygen compared to other fish, so they have to swim continuously to breathe — even while asleep.Cooped up, many died quickly. Eventually, Mr. Kumai learned how to keep them alive and scored a first in 1979 when the fish spawned inside a pen. Still, after hatching, the fry died after a few weeks — a cycle that went on until 1982, when the fish inexplicably stopped spawning.They resumed in 1994, but new problems arose. The fry survived, but the bigger ones kept gobbling up their little brethren. “Other fish, the sea bream or flatfish, do that, too,” Mr. Kumai said. “But tuna are very aggressive. The population could shrink to a third overnight.”Mr. Kumai scooped the fry into bowls — their delicate bodies would chafe at nets — and segregated them by size. Unlike other species, they quickly grew tails but lagged behind in developing other fins — so that they could advance but not turn.“They kept crashing into nets and dying,” Mr. Kumai said with a grave face. “We took X-rays and found their necks were broken.”For fish that can grow to be as large as 1,800 pounds, they are also unusually sensitive. Fireworks, even the headlight of a car, can cause them to panic, crash into nets and break their necks.Nevertheless, many survived and spawned eggs. In 2002, these eggs hatched and the fry survived. By segregating the fry from the larger fish, raising them in bigger pens and adjusting the water temperature and their diet through trial-and-error experiments over the years, he was able to raise them to adulthood. In 2004, these fully farmed bluefin tuna were sold to an expectant nation.“I’ve never met anyone who told me it tastes bad, though I know it’s hard to say that to my face,” said Mr. Kumai, who said he had never eaten wild bluefin.Some sushi chefs here in Kushimoto sniff at the ranched bluefin, saying it yields a fatty meat that does not taste as good as the wild variety. Wild bluefin, migrating across oceans, tend to be lean. But Mr. Kumai’s couch potatoes are 10 percent lean and 90 percent fatty.Because of decreasing stocks, Mr. Kumai’s bluefin is now sold only once a month at a Mitsukoshi department store in Tokyo — for a third less than the wild kind. That fact annoyed Mr. Kumai.“Just because it’s farmed, the prices are automatically lower,” he said. “If it’s good, it’s good. There shouldn’t be a difference.”'"
"'06-09-26,'1','Johnson, 43, has made all his starts this season, a point of pride. He is 17-11 with a 5.00 earned run average and has allowed five earned runs in each of his past three starts. Johnson had not done that in any three-start stretch since late in the 1991 season, when he played for Seattle.As for Giambi, the trainer Gene Monahan told Torre to wait until Tuesday before letting Giambi take swings off a tee. Torre said that Giambi could play as soon as Wednesday.Torre added that he had not ruled out Giambi at first base, even though, according to Giambi, playing there aggravated his wrist injury.“I think if we just limit it to him being a D.H., it sort of limits what we can do,” Torre said. “First base is certainly something we need for him to do.”Mike Mussina’s left thumb injury seems far less worrisome. The right-handed Mussina left Sunday’s start with a bruise after being struck by a line drive, but he said he felt fine.Despite the health questions, there were encouraging signs Monday.Hideki Matsui was in top form, with a home run and 3 of the Yankees’ season-high 20 hits. Bobby Abreu had four hits, including a homer.Starter Jaret Wright threw six strong innings, and Mariano Rivera followed with a scoreless seventh.RODRIGUEZ DEALS WITH SLUMP Alex Rodriguez came into Monday’s game with no hits in 12 at-bats since the release of a revealing article in Sports Illustrated last Tuesday. Rodriguez had little to say about the minislump.“I’ve got nothing,” he said before going 2 for 3. “I’m just looking for solid contact and a solid approach.” Asked if he was making solid contact, Rodriguez said, “Not as often as I’d like, but it’s not a concern.”ROSTER DECISIONS DUE The Yankees will use the last few games to decide on the makeup of their bench for the playoffs. If they take 11 pitchers, and if Jason Giambi is healthy, their bench will probably include outfielders Melky Cabrera and Bernie Williams, catcher Sal Fasano, infielder Miguel Cairo and one other player.Joe Torre has said he may want to have a pinch-runner off the bench, which could bolster the case for infielder Nick Green. Cairo would serve as the primary backup first baseman, as he did in the first three games of this series.Torre said he was most comfortable with Andy Phillips as a backup first baseman, but he also said he was comfortable with Cairo.Green, Phillips, Aaron Guiel and Craig Wilson are under consideration for the final roster spot, and Guiel said he had been thinking about it. Guiel runs well and can also play first base, but he acknowledged he had no spot assured.“It’s something I want to be a part of, but there are some difficult decisions to be made,” said Guiel, whose home run helped the Yankees win here Friday. “You can argue for me being on it, and you can also support other guys being on it, too. The only thing I can do is go out there and try to show them why I’d be useful.”GOING TO SAN FRANCISCO The San Francisco Giants confirmed Monday that they would play host to the Yankees during interleague play next season. The Yankees will play at AT&T Park June 22-24 for their first trip there in the regular season.'"
"'06-09-26,'1','Gov. George E. Pataki plans to head back to Iowa on Friday to open an office for his political action committee — not only to help candidates in November, members of his staff said yesterday, but also to lay more groundwork for his own possible presidential bid in 2008.With plans in the works to open a second office soon in New Hampshire, Mr. Pataki is planting his flag in two states that have significant influence in the presidential nominating process. Iowa holds the first caucuses in the nation in 2008, on Jan. 14, and New Hampshire holds the first primary the following week.The new office, in West Des Moines, will house about five paid staff members of the 21st Century Freedom PAC and coordinate volunteers for 2006 campaigns, according to Rob Cole, the executive director of the political action committee. He said the office would remain open at least through the end of the year — well past Election Day on Nov. 7.Mr. Pataki, who is leaving office at the end of the year after three terms as New York’s governor, is seriously considering a run for the White House, confident that there will be a receptive audience for a Republican candidate who blends socially moderate positions with a message of fiscal conservatism and tough foreign policy, his aides say.Yet if he were to run, the governor would face some formidable obstacles to the Republican nomination. Mr. Pataki supports abortion rights and gay rights, and has pursued a strong state role in environmental protection — positions at odds with powerful factions in his own party.At a meeting of leading Christian conservatives last week, the Rev. Jerry Falwell insisted that the Republican nominee “can’t be a Giuliani and cannot be a Pataki,” according to The Los Angeles Times. “It cannot be a person on the wrong side of the social issues,” added Mr. Falwell, who also said Hillary Rodham Clinton’s candidacy would arouse more evangelical opposition than Lucifer’s.'"
"'06-09-26,'1','WASHINGTON, Sept. 25 — The top Republican and Democratic members of the Senate Intelligence Committee called on Monday for the White House to declassify the National Intelligence Estimate on terrorism that was produced in April.But Bush administration officials said they did not intend to make the document public.The existence of the document was disclosed over the weekend by The New York Times. American officials who have read the document said its conclusions included a judgment that the American invasion and occupation of Iraq had helped fuel the global jihad movement and that Islamic radicalism had spread since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.Senators Pat Roberts, the Kansas Republican who is committee chairman, and John D. Rockefeller IV of West Virginia, the ranking Democrat, said the report should be released to improve understanding of the terrorism threat that the United States faces.“I think the administration should declassify this document so the American people can see the material for themselves and come to their own conclusions,” Mr. Roberts said in a statement.Mr. Roberts and Mr. Rockefeller said the estimate should be stripped of sensitive material before being released.'"
"'06-09-26,'1','UNITED NATIONS, Sept. 25 — The director of the United Nations commission investigating the killing of Rafik Hariri, the former prime minister of Lebanon, reported Monday that it had confirmed preliminary findings that the attack was the work of a suicide bomber but was still pursuing the identities of the participants in the highly organized plot.In a largely technical 22-page report, Serge Brammertz, the prosecutor leading the inquiry, said he had developed evidence from the crime scene about the bombing to a level suitable for presentation to a court and was intent on doing the same thing with evidence pointing to the conspirators.Mr. Hariri, who opposed Syrian domination of his country, was killed along with 22 others when a huge truck bomb exploded as his convoy was moving along a downtown Beirut street on Feb. 14, 2005. The public outrage and mass street demonstrations that followed led Syria to comply with international demands and a Security Council resolution calling on it to withdraw its troops from Lebanon after a 29-year presence.Mr. Brammertz is scheduled to brief the Security Council on his report on Friday.The report was the third from Mr. Brammertz, a Belgian on leave as deputy prosecutor of the International Criminal Court, who succeeded Detlev Mehlis of Germany in January as director of the commission. The Brammertz reports have been more judicial and technical in tone than the two produced by Mr. Mehlis, which read like crime narratives and pointedly accused Syrian intelligence forces of directing the attack and obstructing his inquiry.Mr. Brammertz said he had a better experience with the Syrians. “The cooperation that the commission has received from the Syrian Arab Republic has remained generally satisfactory, and the commission continues to require its full support in providing information and facilitating interviews with individuals located in Syrian territory,” he said in the report.'"
"'06-09-26,'1','Amid the clutter of the workshop, the severed head lay atop two black pillows like a precious jewel. The torso, broad and muscular, stood nearby, wrapped in green tape and chains after an overland journey by truck from the Angkor Conservation Office at Siem Reap, where curators keep special pieces safe from looters at the Angkor Wat temple complex nearby.When the head and torso are joined, the reassembled figure will be a star of a show featuring 140 Khmer treasures — stone sculptures, bronze figures, silver objects, paintings — that are to be sent from the museum to Germany for “Angkor — Sacred Heritage of Cambodia,” an exhibition that opens at the Art and Exhibition Hall in Bonn in December.The Met returned the Shiva head in 1997, four years after one of its curators recognized a photo on a most-wanted list of missing Khmer art circulated by a Unesco agency, said Helen Jessup, a Khmer-art historian and the founder of Friends of Khmer Culture, an American nonprofit group that supports arts organizations. From the black color of the stone and its granular quality it was obvious that the head and the torso were a perfect fit.After long international detective work, the Cleveland Museum of Art returned body parts of a 12th-century Krishna from Phnom Da, the source of some of the most stunning Hindu sculptures in the Angkor region.The Cleveland museum had acquired a sixth-century Krishna from the Belgian art collector Adolphe Stoclet in 1973. Fragments were unearthed later in the Stoclet garden in Brussels and shipped to the museum, which reattached many of them to the Krishna.But nine fragments that did not fit the Cleveland museum’s Krishna proved to belong to a Krishna in the museum here in Phnom Penh. They were cleaned and pieced onto the Krishna torso and head last year in the workshop, and the sculpture — still missing a few parts, and showing some exposed steel struts that keep the fragments in place — is now on view.A tranquil mood reigns at the National Museum, with overhead fans whirring and the soft pad of feet on tiled floors. Saffron-robed monks wander through, leaving stalks of fragrant jasmine at the base of statues of various Hindu divinities.Built in 1917 by George Groslier, a French archaeologist and enthusiast of all things Khmer, the museum was designed in the Khmer style, with steeply pitched roofs and a flamingo pink exterior. The light in the galleries shifts with the position of the sun, as it does in the temples where the statues once stood.Opened with much pomp in 1920 — a vintage photograph shows King Sisowath arriving under the shade of many ornate umbrellas — the museum had an art school attached. Students played an integral role in construction, carving the massive wooden front doors and painting gilded mythological figures on the walls of the front room that remain intact.Air-conditioning is now being installed in one room for an exhibition of Rodin watercolors from the Rodin Museum in Paris. The works depict classical Khmer dancers, whom the artist painted when the troupe traveled to Marseilles in 1906.The permanent collection is arranged in chronological order, allowing visitors to follow the evolution of styles from the pre-Angkor art of the 6th century, on through the many phases of Angkor, which flourished from the early 9th to the mid-15th centuries.And when the 140 Angkor statues leave for Bonn, 140 almost equally precious pieces will be taken up for display from the storeroom, another reflection of the museum’s return to normalcy.'"
"'06-09-26,'1','Since word of the aspen dieback began spreading last fall, Dr. Shepperd’s office began receiving reports of similar losses throughout the West — not just Colorado, where the problem is most predominant, but also in Utah, Idaho, Nevada, Montana, Arizona and southern Wyoming.But because there has been no concerted investigation, it is not clear how many aspen have died, much less why. “Quite honestly we just don’t have any answers,” Dr. Shepperd said.The die-off is particularly worrisome because of the special nature of the aspen. The tree reproduces through vegetative regeneration. Genetically identical suckers sprout from the root of one tree and become clones. If the root of an aspen dies, it is unlikely to reproduce.“We actually dug in a couple of instances and looked for live roots, and we couldn’t find any,” Dr. Shepperd said.The dieback may go back as far as 1996, at the beginning of the recurrent drought, according to Mary Lou Fairweather, a plant pathologist for the Southwestern region of the Forest Service, who said she first noted the loss of trees in Arizona.“I started monitoring the dieback on how the trees were growing, when and if it was continuing,” Ms. Fairweather said.She added that she thought that the first deaths were caused by seasonal climate changes like spring freezes and then accelerated by other factors, including stress affecting the trees, although she noted that those were just theories.In Utah, Dale Bartos, an aspen ecologist for the Forest Service, agreed that the lack of precipitation had contributed more stress to the aspen than initially thought.“We’ve been in a major drought over the last few years, and I’m sure this has exacerbated the problem,” Mr. Bartos said.Dr. Shepperd is not so sure. Although the current drought is probably a factor, he said, extensive long-term studies are needed.“There’s no real pattern,” he said.But he has noticed one intriguing clue. Some younger groves of aspen appear to be more resilient than the mature ones.“Generally, younger stands seem to be healthier,” he said. But he added that it would be discouraging if these younger stands did not sprout. “We’re seeing it across the spectrum of site-conditioned aspen,” he said, meaning that no aspen is safe.Mr. Bartos estimates that at the current rate 10 percent of the aspens in the West could die within several years. Some of his colleagues call that a conservative estimate.“We’ve seen in southern Utah, over a period of 12 years, where we have very healthy-looking clones with dark green leaves go to sites where there aren’t any trees left at all,” Mr. Bartos said, adding that in other cases researchers had observed an even quicker rate of decline. “To me, 12 years is fairly rapid when we’re talking about trees that have been on site for 100 to 125 years.” Nevertheless, the scientists who met in Utah to look for a solution came away somewhat hopeful, said John Guyon, a forest pathologist for the Intermountain Regional Office of the Forest Service.Mr. Guyon said he thought that grazing elk and cattle might be eating away the regenerating aspen. And because the trees thrive after disruptions like avalanches and fires, the lack of such disturbances may be contributing to the dieback.Jim Worrall, another Forest Service pathologist, said the question was fraught with uncertainty.“What we don’t know is what the future holds,” Mr. Worrall said. “It’s an unprecedented event.”'"
"'06-09-26,'1','THE FACTS Companies that sell water filters often claim that the chlorine in most tap water causes cancer. Is it true? Scientists say chlorination can produce at least one group of chemical byproducts, trihalomethanes, that are considered carcinogenic. But studies over the years have differed on whether levels of these compounds in tap water adversely affect health.Some studies have found a link to cancer; others have not. The most reliable findings may be those of meta-analyses, large studies that pool results of many smaller ones. Three such meta-analyses, in 1992, 2003 and 2004, linked long-term consumption of chlorinated water to small increases in the rates of bladder cancer, particularly in men. The analyses adjusted for other risk factors, like age, socioeconomic status and smoking. Some studies analyzed were from the 1970’s, before federal standards for chlorine byproducts were tightened.Several agencies, including the World Health Organization, say the evidence is weak and point out that any risk from chlorine byproducts is tiny compared with risks associated with nonchlorinated water. Many countries that have relaxed chlorination standards have seen outbreaks of cholera and other diseases.The Environmental Protection Agency has set the maximum level for trihalomethanes in tap water at 80 micrograms a liter. In most cities, the levels fall far below that. In New York City, according to the 2005 Drinking Water Supply and Quality Report, the levels average about half that limit.THE BOTTOM LINE Some studies have found byproducts of chlorination associated with a slight increase in cancer risk, but the findings are disputed by major health organizations.'"
"'06-09-26,'1','Researchers have found that smokers may be at higher risk for becoming infected with the virus that causes AIDS.The study, which appears in the journal Sexually Transmitted Infections, says it is not clear why smokers would be more likely to become infected with the virus, H.I.V., than nonsmokers.But the authors pointed to growing evidence that smoking increases the risk of all types of infections, perhaps by changing the structure of the lung or weakening the immune system. They also noted that tobacco use tended to be higher among the groups of people most likely to get AIDS, like prostitutes.AIDS and tobacco use, the study said, are the only two major causes of death that are on the rise, with tobacco projected to play a role in perhaps eight million deaths in a little over a decade.The study was based on a broad review of earlier research that looked at the relationship between smoking and H.I.V. or AIDS. The authors, led by Dr. Andrew Furber, a British researcher, said they had found a “striking” consistency in the evidence that smokers were more likely to become infected. They did not, however, find strong evidence that smoking made AIDS worse.“It may be the case,” they wrote, “that smoking contributes little to the risk of developing AIDS. This may be because the immune mechanisms that smoking affects are less relevant in progression to AIDS than in acquiring the infection in the first place.”'"
"'06-09-26,'1','Lloyd was like “the second Honus Wagner,” Simmons said. “Judy Johnson, they called him Pie Traynor.”Simmons added: “It was a thrill to watch players like that. After a while they were in the big leagues, playing ball, which you thought would never come. But eventually it did come. And that was the greatest thing of my life when I saw these fellows come up and play big-league baseball.” Simmons is not the oldest-known living American — that title belongs to Lizzie Bolden of Memphis, who turned 116 in August. The oldest living person who played Major League Baseball is Rollie Stiles, 99, who pitched for the St. Louis Browns in the early 1930’s.Confined to a wheelchair but reasonably communicative, Simmons has no major health issues beyond his extraordinary age. He is an avid sports fan who watches many Tampa Bay Devil Rays games on the television in his room — “I like young players,” he said — and even attended a Devils Rays game at Tropicana Field this summer with his church group.Friends of his at the Westminster Suncoast retirement community said Simmons rarely talked about his Negro leagues career. Dorothy Russell, 90, said: “When we played volleyball — with balloons — he said, ‘You know, I used to play baseball.’ But he didn’t make it sound so spectacular. And I didn’t know enough to ask him about it.”Negro league researchers did. Wayne Stivers, who spearheaded the fact-finding committee that led to 17 people associated with the Negro leagues being inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame this summer, said: “We were aware there was a Si Simmons and that he played. But we didn’t know he was still alive. We figured, 110, no — this man is not alive. My reaction was, ‘We need to talk with him immediately.’ ”Simmons’s first games were not in the Negro leagues as they are now remembered. The first established circuit, the Negro National League, started in 1920. Before that, local all-black teams would play against one another, against all-white teams or occasionally against groups of big leaguers barnstorming in the off-season.Having grown up in a central Philadelphia row house on 17th and Bainbridge Streets, Simmons was a left-handed pitcher who was signed by the nearby Germantown Blue Ribbons, a well-regarded team. He said he started pitching for the Blue Ribbons at age 16 or 17, meaning 1912 or 1913. Box scores and articles from The Philadelphia Inquirer describe the 5-foot-10 Simmons as routinely striking out 10 or more batters while getting a hit or two a game.Simmons had difficulty remembering all the teams he played on. While unable to explain in detail, he indicated that players, particularly pitchers, were often picked up by other teams for brief stretches, so he might have played select games for other teams as well. (Experts confirmed that this practice was commonplace.) Researchers have uncovered box scores and game recaps with his name from many years throughout the 1910’s and beyond.Two box scores from 1926 show Simmons pitching in relief for the New York Lincoln Giants of the Eastern Colored League. He also played at least one game for the Negro National League’s Cuban Stars in 1929.“I had a good curveball and a good fastball,” said Simmons, who added that he was paid about $10 a game. He said that in his prime he might have been good enough to play in the major leagues, but did not consider asking for a tryout. “It was useless to try,” he said.“A lot of good black players, but they couldn’t play in the league,” he continued. “So that was it. After Jackie Robinson came up, they found out how good they were and started recruiting. You have to give them a chance to play.“Negroes had a lot of pride. They felt like baseball, that was the greatest thing in the world for them. You had some great players in those days. Biz Mackey. Pop Lloyd. Judy Johnson. Scrappy Brown, the shortstop. We played against all those players.”Simmons ended his baseball career soon after 1929. He had five children and settled into life as a porter and eventually as an assistant manager at Rosenbaum’s Department Store in Plainfield, N.J. He retired to St. Petersburg in 1971 and lived with his second wife, Rebecca, until she died seven years ago. Having outlived his children, he moved into Westminster soon afterward.His discovery has caused a buzz in baseball’s large community of historians. Dr. Layton Revel, the founder of the Center for Negro League Baseball Research near Dallas, took particular interest and flew to St. Petersburg this summer to interview Simmons and confirm his birth date, career and stories. Revel was so excited that he plans to throw a party for Simmons on Oct. 14, with 30 to 40 former Negro leaguers — including the Hall of Famer Monte Irvin — gathering to celebrate his 111th birthday and hear about the even older days.Most of those men played in the Negro leagues decades after Simmons, primarily in the 1940’s and 1950’s as the circuits were decimated by players jumping to major league clubs. Chances are that no face will look even vaguely familiar to Simmons.But as Simmons held that old sepia photo of the 1913 Homestead Grays for those long 20 seconds, he gradually decided that one face did ring a bell. He fixed on it and pointed his weathered hand at the player sitting in the middle row, second from the right. He said nothing as he pointed.Who is that? he was asked.Really? Was he sure?“That’s me,” he declared. “Oh, we had good times.”'"

"'06-09-27,'1','The first postings, Mr. Faulkner said, came in 2001 after he had returned from Scotland. “I thought the site would be a cool way for my family to see pictures without me having to e-mail them,” Mr. Faulkner said.Soon after, Mr. Faulkner started receiving e-mail messages from people interested in his thoughts on Scotland and other places he had visited. Mr. Faulkner also posted messages on VirtualTourist’s forums, which cover thousands of topics, and soon he was corresponding with people throughout the world.The Web site’s membership is large enough — more than 700,000 people have registered — that even minor tourist destinations are likely to be represented by several members, if not more. So it was natural for Mr. Faulkner to begin meeting his online pen pals while abroad, he said.In 2004, he attended his first VirtualTourist group event in London, organized by one of the site’s regulars. The organizer, who was a local, led a Jack the Ripper walking tour for 20 people, and followed it with a group dinner at a tavern. “We all ended up staying out until probably 3 in the morning,” Mr. Faulkner said.J. R. Johnson, chief executive of VirtualTourist, said that such meetings were common, as is online communication among members. The site delivers more than 111,000 e-mail messages among members each month, and even more from nonmembers who want to ask members some questions.“Our goal is for people not to have to contact anyone because all the information will already be there,” Mr. Johnson said. “But we make it easy to write the person directly if they’d like.”For casual users who do not want to register, VirtualTourist still allows access to its search tools, as well as ranking features that let readers view the most highly rated tipsters for a given destination.TripMates, a new Los Angeles site, is trying to create better search abilities than its competitors, said Sam Rogoway, the company’s chief executive. The site, which has 3,000 members, allows users to search for members who have particular connections to a given destination. For instance, users who are interested in learning about student travel in Florence can find others who have identified themselves as having knowledge on that topic.TripMates’ users can choose from at least 10 criteria to narrow the types of people from which to seek travel tips or to contact. “Other sites may have a lot of information, but we can help you find the profile that’ll be most useful for you,” Mr. Rogoway said.Yahoo Travel has also made strides in its social networking service. Late last year, it introduced several new features, including Trip Planner, where travelers post their journeys and reviews for others to see.When Yahoo’s registered users click on a trip plan from someone who shares their interests or sensibilities, they can click a button near that person’s planner that says “I like this trip.” On future visits to Yahoo’s Travel section, the site will include updated plans or postings from like-minded travelers.Understanding the person delivering the travel advice is crucial to making good use of networking sites, said Ms. Clarkson of Jupiter Research. On a recent trip to Miami, she said, she stayed at a certain hotel on the advice of an online reviewer. “But when I got there, I realized the hotel was for the early-bird-special, blue-hair crowd,” Ms. Clarkson said. “It didn’t occur to me to think, ‘How old is the person who wrote this?’ ”'"
"'06-09-27,'1','Intel won a ruling yesterday that limits an antitrust lawsuit by Advanced Micro Devices to claims over United States sales.Judge Joseph J. Farnan Jr. of United States District Court in Delaware granted Intel’s motion to exclude Advanced Micro’s foreign commerce claims for lack of jurisdiction, according to an electronic court filing.Advanced Micro sued Intel last year, claiming that its larger rival had built up a dominant share of the worldwide market for microprocessors by stifling competition and trying to coerce customers into not buying Advanced Micro products.Advanced Micro is seeking damages based mostly on the sales of its German-made microprocessors in foreign countries where United States courts have no jurisdiction, Intel said in a brief filed May 3.“Courts have recognized that reduced income flowing from a foreign subsidiary to a domestic parent is not a direct domestic effect or injury,” Judge Farnan wrote yesterday.Representatives of the two companies will meet the judge for a trial-planning meeting today.Chuck Mulloy, a spokesman for Intel, said: “We are grateful the judge appears to have agreed with our legal analysis and arguments.” He added: “We will wait until after the meeting with the judge before further comment.”'"
"'06-09-27,'1','He played eight innings and appeared to have no problems, though he did not face any real challenges. It was, Matsui said, a return he welcomed.“As a baseball player, you want to be able to do all the aspects of the game,” Matsui said through his interpreter. “To be able to get to this point, I’m very happy.”Whether Matsui will be the team’s regular left fielder when the Yankees open the playoffs is still up in the air, Torre said, in part because of the other issues facing the team. Those issues include Jason Giambi’s wrist tendinitis and Gary Sheffield’s continued adjustment to playing first base, his new position since his return from a wrist injury.If everyone is healthy, the Yankees have a wealth of options, so many that Torre will have to pick and choose to set his lineup. Torre said he gave a pep talk yesterday to outfielder Melky Cabrera, who could be displaced if Matsui returns to left field on a regular basis, and if Giambi is healthy.“Joe’s going to have a nice problem,” Giambi said. “Who’s going to play where?”There was more good news before last night’s game. Giambi, who has missed six games with his wrist problems, took about 30 or 40 swings off a tee and 20 batting-practice swings, and said he felt good. He could be in the lineup as soon as tonight, Torre said.The question remains whether Torre would want Giambi to play first base instead of Sheffield, who had never played the position before coming off the disabled list last week. Sheffield made his fifth straight start there last night and had a run-scoring single.Torre said he would like to play Giambi at first base before the end of the regular season, but Giambi said that because his injured wrist is on his glove hand, it could aggravate the problem.“I would like to in a perfect world,” Giambi said of being at first base. “But I really can’t make that assumption right now because I haven’t been out there yet.”Beyond the lineup issues, the Yankees face questions regarding their starting rotation, now that Randy Johnson has been scratched from his final start of the regular season with back spasms. At this point, Torre said, there was nothing for Johnson to do except rest and hope his back responds well.“You always keep your fingers crossed when it comes to the health of your pitchers,” Torre said. “They’re like thoroughbred horses. They’re champions, but anything can happen at any time.”For that reason, the Yankees were also paying special attention to Lidle last night. Jaret Wright appears to have solidified his position as the fourth playoff starter, but Torre insisted that the decision had not been made, and said only that he was hoping to carry 11 pitchers on his playoff roster, including at least one who can “give us some length.”Lidle made his case, giving up three runs and six hits, allowing solo home runs to Jay Gibbons, Ramón Hernández and Corey Patterson.“They haven’t told me anything yet,” Lidle said. “I’ll just be ready when they say my name.”Now, as with everything else, the decision is up to Torre.Second baseman Robinson Canó, chasing the American League batting title, started at designated hitter last night. “We just thought it was the safest thing,” Joe Torre said. Canó went 2 for 5 with a solo home run in the fourth inning and raised his average to .343. He trails Minnesota’s Joe Mauer (.349). Derek Jeter went 2 for 4 and is hitting .341.'"
"'06-09-27,'1','The Bush administration had initially resisted releasing the document but changed course after being pressured to declassify the report by Republicans, including Senator Pat Roberts of Kansas, chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, and by the conservative editorial page of The Wall Street Journal.At a news conference on Tuesday where he announced the release of portions of the document, President Bush suggested forcefully that news reports in the past two days about the document had been based on politically motivated leaks.“You know, to suggest that if we weren’t in Iraq we would see a rosier scenario, with fewer extremists joining the radical movement, requires us to ignore 20 years of experience,” Mr. Bush said. He added: “My judgment is: The only way to protect this country is to stay on the offense.”The intelligence estimate says that if jihadists who leave Iraq perceive themselves, or are perceived by others, to have failed, fewer fighters will be inspired to keep fighting.Democrats seized on the document’s conclusions as proof that the invasion of Iraq was a mistake.“The war in Iraq has made us less safe,” said Senator John D. Rockefeller IV of West Virginia, the top Democrat on the Senate intelligence committee. Mr. Rockefeller said the judgments contained in the intelligence estimate “make it clear that the intelligence community — all 16 agencies — believe the war in Iraq has fueled terrorism.”The estimate was the first formal appraisal of the terrorism threat by American intelligence agencies since the invasion of Iraq began in March 2003. The public release of any portion of such a document is highly unusual. The White House declassified fewer than 4 pages of what officials described as a document of more than 30 pages, saying that to release more of it would endanger intelligence sources and methods.The release of the findings added fuel to an intense political debate about the administration’s record in combating terrorism. Mr. Bush used the news conference to reassert his view that the Iraq war was not to blame for the growth of Islamic radicalism.He also attributed the disclosure of some of the assessment findings to what he said were government officials leaking classified information to “create confusion in the minds of the American people” weeks before an important Congressional election.The first article on the findings was published Sunday in The New York Times after more than five weeks of reporting. More than a dozen United States government officials and outside experts were interviewed for the article, including employees of several government agencies and both supporters and critics of the Bush administration.Democrats also criticized the White House for only declassifying part of the report, and the House minority leader, Nancy Pelosi of California, tried and failed to persuade Republicans to agree to a vote that would have shut the doors of the House of Representatives to allow members to read the entire classified report.Officials who have read the entire document said the still-classified portion contained a more detailed analysis of the impact of the Iraq war on the global jihad movement. Representative Jane Harman of California, the top Democrat on the House intelligence committee, said that what the White House released Tuesday was broadly consistent with the classified portion of the report.National intelligence estimates are the most authoritative documents that American intelligence agencies produce on a specific national security issue. They represent the consensus view of the 16 intelligence agencies in government, and are approved by John D. Negroponte, director of national intelligence.The release on Tuesday of portions of the document was the second time that the Bush administration had come under political pressure to declassify a national intelligence estimate.In July 2003, the White House released the principal judgments of an October 2002 National Intelligence Estimate about Iraq’s weapons programs in an attempt to address a furor over the origins of President Bush’s statement, made in a State of the Union address, that Saddam Hussein had been trying to buy nuclear materials in Niger.In recent months, without disclosing the existence of the intelligence estimate on terrorism, some senior American intelligence officials have given glimpses into its conclusions. During a speech in San Antonio in April, Gen. Michael V. Hayden, who was then Mr. Negroponte’s deputy, said new jihadist networks and cells were increasingly likely to emerge.“If this trend continues, threats to the U.S. at home and abroad will become more diverse and that could lead to increasing attacks worldwide,” General Hayden said, using the exact language of the intelligence assessment made public on Tuesday. General Hayden is now director of the Central Intelligence Agency.But the intelligence assessment paints a starker picture of the role that the Iraq war is playing in shaping a new generation of terrorist leaders than that presented either in recent White House documents or in speeches by President Bush tied to the fifth anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks.The intelligence report specifically cited the role of the Jordanian terrorist Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, who led the Iraqi group Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia, in attracting new recruits for the jihad cause in Iraq, and stated that “should al-Zarqawi continue to evade capture and scale back attacks against Muslims, we assess he could broaden his popular appeal and present a global threat.”He was killed by American forces in June.Frances Fragos Townsend, the president’s homeland security adviser, suggested to reporters on Tuesday that the killing of Mr. Zarqawi might ultimately help dampen the appeal of jihad in Iraq.At the same time, the report concludes that the increased role of Iraqis in managing the operations of Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia “might lead veteran foreign jihadists to focus their efforts on external operations.”To be successful in combating the spread of a radical ideology, the assessment states, the United States government “must go well beyond operations to capture or kill terrorist leaders.”'"

"'06-09-27,'1','AOL and a group of entertainment entrepreneurs who created a venture to produce and distribute live concerts on the Internet and elsewhere have dissolved their partnership after just 14 months, executives in the venture said yesterday.The move to unwind the venture, which was called Network Live, came as its co-founder and chief executive, Kevin Wall, announced that he had struck a new deal to produce live events to be distributed through Microsoft’s online service and, potentially, through products like Xbox. The venture with Microsoft will be called Control Room, he said.Mr. Wall characterized the parting with former partners — which initially included AOL, XM Satellite Radio and the concert promoter AEG Live — as amicable. AEG Live is expected to continue to run a concert broadcast unit under the name Network Live.One person involved in the Network Live venture, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that Mr. Wall’s partners had become frustrated with its performance, and that Mr. Wall did not appear to generating a return fast enough or booking and broadcasting enough concerts.Part of the reason, the person said, is that record labels and performers had at times been unwilling to agree to offer the concerts online.Mr. Wall, who produced Live8 benefit concerts for poverty relief last year that became a hit on AOL, said the venture generated 59 events since it began in July.He acknowledged that the maze of copyright issues involved with offering concert Webcasts had been a challenge.'"
"'06-09-27,'1','Ethnic and racial claims on elected offices are nothing new. Black residents in Brooklyn this year urged David Yassky, a white Democrat, to step aside as a candidate in the majority-black 11th Congressional District. Mr. Yassky went on to lose the primary. But in Memphis, a city with lingering memories of Jim Crow’s political exclusion of blacks, these claims are being made with special urgency. They are accompanied by Bible Belt reminders that Mr. Cohen, who is Jewish, is not only of a different race, but also a different faith.“Mr. Cohen has stood on the floor of the Tennessee Senate and opposed the chaplain of the day praying for Jesus,” said the Rev. Dr. LaSimba M. Gray Jr., a prominent local pastor who has helped lead opposition to Mr. Cohen’s candidacy.Dr. Gray also condemned Mr. Cohen’s refusal to denounce same-sex marriage, a persistent theme of his critics here. “At this point, Jake Ford is in a better position to represent our values and our community,” he said.Mr. Ford is a high school dropout with a G.E.D. He has never held elected office, says he is currently working for his father’s consulting firm (“You can pretty much call me what you want,” he said, when asked to describe his occupation) and has been christened Joke Ford on a widely read blog written by a local black resident.Because of the contrasting résumés of the two candidates, there is hardly unanimity among blacks here in supporting Mr. Ford. Mayor Willie W. Herenton, who is black and a longtime rival of the Ford family, announced his support for Mr. Cohen two weeks ago.“I felt it was time in this community on this occasion that we show solidarity that will cut across political ideology, race, ethnocentrism, any kind of prejudice and to support a man who’s eminently qualified for this role,” Mayor Herenton said recently at a news conference, according to The Commercial Appeal, Memphis’s major newspaper.Mr. Cohen is the grandson of an immigrant from Lithuania. He recalls exclusion, as a Jew, from fraternities at Vanderbilt University in the 1960’s, and for years was the lone loser in fights with colleagues in the legislature over issues like publicly posting the Ten Commandments. He has said that, if elected, he will seek membership in the Congressional Black Caucus, though it is not clear if the caucus would allow him to join.Yet it was evident recently in a campaign swing through a historic black neighborhood that the opinions of black leaders have had some resonance. One of those leaders, William Larsha of the Shelby County Democratic Executive Committee, is urging blacks to prevent a Cohen victory by turning out to vote against the Democratic candidate in November.“In 1974, it became a Congressional black district,” Mr. Larsha said. “It also became, to most black people, a precious district. And it became a historically black Congressional district. I believe it was put together by decent white people to be a black district, which gives African-Americans an opportunity to be elected to Congress.”But poverty is persistent in the district — 20 percent of the population is poor — the schools are ailing and the crime rate is high.“The Fords, they’re more on the scene,” said Anthony Bridgewater, 28, a community college student who was watching Mr. Cohen charge ahead of a black high school band in a recent game-day parade in the tattered Orange Mound district. “They visit churches, come into the schools. Over here in Orange Mound, the Fords can relate to people better. Steve Cohen is more of a Nashville-type person.”Yet others along the parade route, lined with boarded-up stores, marginal auto repair shops and sagging front porches, said they were fed up with the Fords. Indeed, Cohen supporters appeared to outnumber Ford supporters along the route.“Take your blinders off and look at the condition of Memphis,” said Jeffrey Hines, a resident watching the band assembled at Melrose High School. “Crime’s gone up and the school system is failing our children, and we’ve had an African-American in Congress for 30 years.”A political scientist at Rhodes College here, Marcus D. Pohlmann, called Mr. Cohen the favorite, by a considerable way, but added that black voters “might still just vote the Ford name.”Articulate and voluble, the younger Mr. Ford dismisses any suggestion of dynastic entitlement. Standing by his side, however, at a Steamfitters Union local, where he had gone to seek its blessing, was his father, who beat back federal corruption charges in the early 1990’s and remains a force in local politics. Smiling, the elder Mr. Ford said simply, “This seat belongs to the people of the Ninth District.”A union member, Roy Turner, jumped in with an attack on Mr. Cohen’s position on same-sex marriage: “I’m against all that homosexual stuff.”Jake Ford quickly added, “I certainly want to protect the sanctity of marriage.”Critics of Mr. Cohen have made insinuations about his bachelorhood; he volunteers that he is not gay, but that he is simply “older.”In his Depression-era home on Overton Park, which is crammed with a lifetime’s worth of political memorabilia, Mr. Cohen wearily dismissed the attacks over same-sex marriage and speculated that a victory for him, as a white man, could be a moment of racial reconciliation for this city of the Deep South.“I think it will be an overcoming, a coming together,” he said. “And I think it will say we’ve overcome a lot of the problems since Dr. King was killed.”'"
"'06-09-27,'1','But Intel, despite a deep round of cost-cutting announced Sept. 6, is beginning to reverse its market-share decline based on the success of its first two generations of dual-core processors, analysts said.“I think that Intel now has the initiative,” said Roger Kay, president of Endpoint Technology Associates, a computer industry consulting firm. “They’re hitting their deadlines and even pulling them in a bit.”Intel’s success in quickly bringing to market several generations of multiple-core chips is reflected in its winning back customers like Rackable Systems, a server maker that had moved almost entirely to A.M.D.“We’re hearing a lot behind the scenes about new customer wins for Intel during the next nine months,” said Richard Doherty, president of Envisioneering, a computer industry consulting firm in Seaford, N.Y.Intel and A.M.D. are taking different routes to the next generation. On Monday night at a dinner for reporters here, A.M.D.’s chief technology officer, Phil Hester, displayed a test wafer holding prototypes of the company’s quad-core processor, to be commercially available in mid-2007.A.M.D. is beginning to focus on new designs that it is planning for 2008 based on its soon-to-be-completed acquisition of ATI Technologies, a maker of graphics coprocessors. By combining aspects of the two types of processors on a single chip, A.M.D. will be able to create a more balanced system in the future, he said.“This is not just technology for technology’s sake,” he said.In contrast to Intel, which will initially make its quad-core processor by packing two connected dual-core chips in a single package, A.M.D. will wait until its manufacturing process can achieve features as small as 65 nanometers, compared with the current 90, permitting it to place all four processor cores on a single chip.Intel has a substantial lead in 65-nanometer manufacturing, and said Tuesday that it planned to add capacity in Arizona and Israel for a total investment of $9 billion in the most advanced generation of chip making. But the company decided to package two dual-core chips in a single package to gain a half-year lead in the new quad-core approach.At a news conference, Mr. Otellini defended the approach, asserting that it would not result in any performance disadvantage. “The initial ones are multi-chip, but so what?” he said. “You guys are misreading the market if you think people care what’s in the package.”Intel also announced that it was making quicker progress on an initiative it introduced at its annual developer conference last year to reduce the power required for processing by a factor of 10. “In 2008 we’ll meet our decade goal of a 10X reduction in power,” he said.According to Intel executives, this degree of power savings is needed to enable a future generation of ultra-light and portable computers.Mr. Otellini also described a new research effort to build a processor capable of a trillion mathematical operations a second on a single piece of silicon. The research prototype, which contains 80 specialized math processors controlled by a single general processor, will be commercially available within five years, he said.The project is an effort to match the processing power of what was in 1996 the world’s fastest supercomputer. That machine was used by weapons designers and was composed of 10,000 Pentium microprocessors, occupied about 2,000 square feet of floor space and cost $50 million.In the interview after his speech, Mr. Otellini said that the new teraflop chip did not undercut the need for Intel’s troubled Itanium microprocessor, which the company has aimed at the high end of the computing marketplace.Intel executives also described a new notebook design code-named Santa Rosa, to be available in the second half of 2007. It will include the coming 802.11n wireless standard, potentially five times as fast as current Wi-Fi systems.'"
"'06-09-27,'1','Falling gasoline prices helped ease American shoppers’ worries in September, sending a gauge of consumer sentiment higher than analysts had expected.The Conference Board, a private research group based in New York, said yesterday that its consumer confidence index rebounded to 104.5 from a revised reading of 100.2 in August. Analysts had expected the index to rise to 103. The reading, the highest since 107 in July, followed a big dip in August, when employment worries dragged down consumer sentiment.The board’s present situation index, which measures how shoppers feel now about economic conditions, rose to 127.7 from 123.9. Its expectations index, which measures consumers’ outlook over the next six months, rose to 89.0 from 84.4 last month.“What we are seeing is an easing of concerns,” said Lynn Franco, director of the Conference Board’s consumer research center. “People are becoming less pessimistic, not significantly more optimistic.”Lower prices at the pump have helped lift consumer sentiment, economists said. Over the last month, the retail price of gasoline fell 50 cents, or 17 percent, to average $2.38 a gallon nationwide, according to Energy Department statistics. That is 42.5 cents lower than a year earlier and compares with a nationwide record of $3.023 a gallon reported early in August.Also important, according to economists, is that the job market was steady, although the consumers asked still showed some concerns about jobs in the latest survey, Ms. Franco said. The Labor Department’s latest report on employment showed a modest increase in jobs in August, with wages barely higher.Ms. Franco cautioned that although many consumers’ concerns had eased, “there is little to suggest a significant change in economic activity as we enter the final quarter of 2006.”'"
"'06-09-27,'1','So what does the name mean? Bonser said he never asked and does not care to find out, even after years of questions from reporters, teammates, acquaintances and the occasional restaurant hostess.“I don’t really want to know why, to be honest with you,” said Bonser, 24. “I guess I had no reason to go up and ask her. I just left it at that.”Boof, of course, rhymes with poof, which is what many Twins fans figured the team’s playoff chances went once Liriano left an Aug. 7 start in Detroit with elbow pain. Liriano returned Sept. 13, but lasted only two innings against Oakland before the pain returned, ending his season.Until Liriano’s injury, the Twins’ left-handed combination of Liriano and the Cy Young Award candidate Johan Santana figured to scare any team in a three-of-five-game series. The Twins’ rotation no longer appears as formidable, but the pitching coach Rick Anderson said he would trust Bonser, who is 7-5 with a 4.15 E.R.A., to start at Yankee Stadium.Then again, the Twins do not have much choice. Carlos Silva (10-14, 5.95 E.R.A.) has proved unreliable, the 22-year-old rookie Matt Garza (3-2, 5.32) is even greener than Bonser, and the veteran Brad Radke, who is scheduled to pitch Thursday, has been out since Aug. 25 with a stress fracture in his right shoulder. Radke (12-9, 4.46), who says he will retire after the season, has pitched all year with a torn labrum.Though Bonser has never faced the Yankees, Anderson likes his presence and poise. “The biggest thing is his confidence,” Anderson said. “You look at him on the mound, and it looks like he belongs.”Bonser did not belong when the Twins first called him up from Class AAA Rochester in May. Anderson said Bonser was “in awe” of being a major leaguer, and Bonser said it took him three or four starts to get over it. He was 2-2 with a 5.30 E.R.A. when the Twins sent him down in early July.Brought up for an Aug. 2 start at Texas, Bonser was sent right back to Rochester after pitching poorly in a 10-2 loss (seven runs, four earned, in four innings). Already angry at the demotion, Bonser grew livid a few days later when the Twins, needing a starter, called up his teammate Garza, who began the season in Class A.“Everybody said I was mad because Garza went up,” Bonser said. “I wasn’t mad at him. He and I are friends.“It’s just that everybody wants to pitch up here. Nobody wants to pitch in the minor leagues. I want to pitch here, not at Triple A.”Recalled on Aug. 9, Bonser, who throws a low-90’s fastball, a curve, a slider and a changeup, struggled for four starts before his September run. Finally able to control his off-speed pitches, Bonser gave up one run in back-to-back victories over Tampa Bay and Detroit.His most impressive outing came Sept. 20 at Fenway Park, when he held the Red Sox to two runs over seven innings in an 8-2 victory. On Monday, he limited the Royals to one run and two hits in six and two-thirds innings and left the mound to a cheer of “Boooooof” from the Metrodome crowd.“Early in the year, I think some of the hitters eliminated a lot of his pitches because he wasn’t throwing them over,” catcher Joe Mauer said. “Now he’s throwing them over, and he’s got a lot more confidence.”And Bonser, now more than just the guy with the nickname, is loving every minute.“I was up and down three times, but I got my chance to pitch,” he said. “I’m going to pitch in October, and that’s a big thing for this club. If you want to pitch up here, you want to pitch in October, that’s for sure.“Growing up, going through Little League and watching guys do this, and finally getting to do it — no words can describe.”'"

"'06-09-27,'1','We assess that the global jihadist movement is decentralized, lacks a coherent global strategy and is becoming more diffuse. New jihadist networks and cells, with anti-American agendas, are increasingly likely to emerge. The confluence of shared purpose and dispersed actors will make it harder to find and undermine jihadist groups.¶We assess that the operational threat from self-radicalized cells will grow in importance to U.S. counterterrorism efforts, particularly abroad but also in the Homeland.¶The jihadists regard Europe as an important venue for attacking Western interests. Extremist networks inside the extensive Muslim diasporas in Europe facilitate recruitment and staging for urban attacks, as illustrated by the 2004 Madrid and 2005 London bombings.We assess that the Iraq jihad is shaping a new generation of terrorist leaders and operatives; perceived jihadist success there would inspire more fighters to continue the struggle elsewhere.¶The Iraq conflict has become the cause célèbre for jihadists, breeding a deep resentment of U.S. involvement in the Muslim world and cultivating supporters for the global jihadist movement. Should jihadists leaving Iraq perceive themselves, and be perceived, to have failed, we judge fewer fighters will be inspired to carry on the fight.We assess that the underlying factors fueling the spread of the movement outweigh its vulnerabilities and are likely to do so for the duration of the time frame of this Estimate.¶Four underlying factors are fueling the spread of the jihadist movement: (1) entrenched grievances, such as corruption, injustice, and fear of Western domination, leading to anger, humiliation, and a sense of powerlessness; (2) the Iraq jihad; (3) the slow pace of real and sustained economic, social, and political reforms in many Muslim majority nations; and (4) pervasive anti-U.S. sentiment among most Muslims — all of which jihadists exploit.Concomitant vulnerabilities in the jihadist movement have emerged that, if fully exposed and exploited, could begin to slow the spread of the movement. They include dependence on the continuation of Muslim-related conflicts, the limited appeal of the jihadists’ radical ideology, the emergence of respected voices of moderation and criticism of the violent tactics employed against mostly Muslim citizens.¶The jihadists’ greatest vulnerability is that their ultimate political solution — an ultraconservative interpretation of Shariah-based governance spanning the Muslim world — is unpopular with the vast majority of Muslims. Exposing the religious and political straitjacket that is implied by the jihadists’ propaganda would help to divide them from the audiences they seek to persuade.¶Recent condemnations of violence and extremist religious interpretations by a few notable Muslim clerics signal a trend that could facilitate the growth of a constructive alternative to jihadist ideology: peaceful political activism. This also could lead to the consistent and dynamic participation of broader Muslim communities in rejecting violence, reducing the ability of radicals to capitalize on passive community support. In this way, the Muslim mainstream emerges as the most powerful weapon in the war on terror.¶Countering the spread of the jihadist movement will require coordinated multilateral efforts that go well beyond operations to capture or kill terrorist leaders.If democratic reform efforts in Muslim majority nations progress over the next five years, political participation probably would drive a wedge between intransigent extremists and groups willing to use the political process to achieve their local objectives. Nonetheless, attendant reforms and potentially destabilizing transitions will create new opportunities for jihadists to exploit.Al Qaeda, now merged with Abu Musab al-Zarqawi’s network, is exploiting the situation in Iraq to attract new recruits and donors and to maintain its leadership role.¶The loss of key leaders, particularly Osama bin Laden, Ayman al-Zawahri, and al-Zarqawi, in rapid succession, probably would cause the group to fracture into smaller groups. Although like-minded individuals would endeavor to carry on the mission, the loss of these key leaders would exacerbate strains and disagreements. We assess that the resulting splinter groups would, at least for a time, pose a less serious threat to U.S. interests than does Al Qaeda.¶Should al-Zarqawi continue to evade capture and scale back attacks against Muslims, we assess he could broaden his popular appeal and present a global threat.¶The increased role of Iraqis in managing the operations of Al Qaeda in Iraq might lead veteran foreign jihadists to focus their efforts on external operations.Other affiliated Sunni extremist organizations, such as Jemaah Islamiya, Ansar al Sunna, and several North African groups, unless countered, are likely to expand their reach and become more capable of multiple and/or mass-casualty attacks outside their traditional areas of operation.¶We assess that such groups pose less of a danger to the Homeland than does Al Qaeda but will pose varying degrees of threat to our allies and to U.S. interests abroad. The focus of their attacks is likely to ebb and flow between local regime targets and regional or global ones.We judge that most jihadist groups — both well-known and newly formed — will use improvised explosive devices and suicide attacks focused primarily on soft targets to implement their asymmetric warfare strategy, and that they will attempt to conduct sustained terrorist attacks in urban environments. Fighters with experience in Iraq are a potential source of leadership for jihadists pursuing these tactics.¶CBRN [chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear weapons] capabilities will continue to be sought by jihadist groups. While Iran, and to a lesser extent Syria, remain the most active state sponsors of terrorism, many other states will be unable to prevent territory or resources from being exploited by terrorists.Anti-U.S. and anti-globalization sentiment is on the rise and fueling other radical ideologies. This could prompt some leftist, nationalist, or separatist groups to adopt terrorist methods to attack U.S. interests. The radicalization process is occurring more quickly, more widely, and more anonymously in the Internet age, raising the likelihood of surprise attacks by unknown groups whose members and supporters may be difficult to pinpoint.¶We judge that groups of all stripes will increasingly use the Internet to communicate, propagandize, recruit, train and obtain logistical and financial support.'"
"'06-09-27,'1','The City University of New York announced yesterday that it plans to open a graduate school of public health.The university has added several schools and programs in recent years, including an honors college and a graduate journalism school.“Demographers are predicting that by 2030, more than three quarters of the world’s population will be living in urban areas,” he said after lunch. “Urban health problems, like diabetes and obesity, are on the rise. As the largest urban public university in America, we hope to be able to work against these scourges.”He said that the public university is expected to charge lower tuition than private universities and assemble a more diverse class.Of 37 accredited schools of public health in the United States, only three are in New York: at Columbia University, the State University of New York’s University at Albany and New York Medical College. There are also many master’s degree programs in public health, including those at CUNY’s Hunter College and SUNY’s Downstate Medical Center in Brooklyn.Columbia’s Mailman School of Public Health, with more than 900 students in master’s and doctoral programs, charges about $13,200 to $16,500 in tuition a semester. SUNY charges $6,900 in tuition a year for state residents.The Mailman School said it received about 1,400 masters applications last year and accepted about half. It says its category of underrepresented minorities accounted for 17 percent of its enrollment, while students from 50 countries represented 11 percent.'"
"'06-09-27,'1','Boston Scientific said yesterday that it did not understand why Johnson & Johnson had waited five months after the deal closed to pursue its objections. In a statement the company said: “We believe the suit is meritless, and we expect to demonstrate that in court.” Abbott said in a statement: “The suit is without merit.”Johnson & Johnson said in its complaint that it notified Guidant in early January that it believed Guidant had violated the “no solicitation” clause in their agreement and had followed up with a written warning in a letter Jan. 23. Guidant responded that it considered Abbott a joint bidder entitled to the information disclosed.The deal, which closed April 21, has not gone as smoothly as Boston Scientific expected. The company has experienced unexpectedly weak growth in the heart implant business, which was its main reason for acquiring Guidant.“It’s strange on the surface, because Johnson & Johnson probably benefited by not getting Guidant,” Robert M. Goldman, who follows the medical device industry for KeyBanc Capital Markets, said of the lawsuit. Johnson & Johnson also received $705 million from Guidant as a breakup fee. Johnson & Johnson raised its bid twice before refusing to compete with Boston Scientific’s last offer. Johnson & Johnson had originally agreed to buy Guidant for $76 a share late in 2004. But reports of deadly defects in some of Guidant’s defibrillators and criticism of delays in disclosing that information to doctors hurt Guidant’s prospects so much that Johnson & Johnson insisted on paying a lower price.That led to a $63.08-a-share deal that was nearing completion when Boston Scientific ignited a bidding war last December.Boston Scientific’s shares, which closed trading yesterday down 15 cents at $14.80, have fallen nearly 40 percent this year. Johnson & Johnson, which is far larger and more diversified, rose 48 cents, to $64.67 yesterday. They have risen 6.3 percent this year. Abbott, which remains primarily a drug company but is expanding in devices, rose 12 cents, to $48.07. Its shares have climbed 19 percent this year.In an unrelated development yesterday, Johnson & Johnson said federal regulators had cleared its Cordis subsidiary to market a stent to prop open neck arteries.Cordis was the first to complete clinical trials for the device, known as a carotid stent, but both Guidant and Abbott beat it to market because Cordis was hit more than two years ago with a warning letter citing numerous manufacturing and quality control violations at its factories. The Food and Drug Administration put all major marketing approvals for Cordis on hold while it dealt with those problems.That warning letter has not yet been lifted, but Cordis announced last month that all that remains is a reinspection by the Food and Drug Administration of its factory in San German, Puerto Rico. The carotid stent and a related filter are not made at that plant, according to Carol Goodrich, a Cordis spokeswoman.'"
"'06-09-27,'1','NEW ORLEANS, Sept. 26 (AP) — A federal jury ruled in favor of Merck on Tuesday in a lawsuit over the painkiller Vioxx, finding that there was not enough evidence to link the drug to a Kentucky man’s heart attack.The jury, made up of six women and two men, deliberated about three hours before reaching a verdict.Robert Garry Smith, 56, asserted in Federal District Court that the drug had contributed to a heart attack he had in 2003. He said he had taken Vioxx for knee pain for about four and a half months but did not realize at the time of the heart attack that Vioxx might have been a cause for concern.Merck’s lawyer said there was no medical testimony indicating that Vioxx had anything to do with Mr. Smith’s heart attack.Merck withdrew Vioxx from the market two years ago after a study found a greater risk of heart attack in people who had taken the drug continually for at least 18 months.Including the verdict on Tuesday, the drug maker has won five cases and lost four Vioxx-related cases in state and federal courts. A sixth case that Merck won was overturned by a judge and is set to be retried. At least 14,200 cases are pending nationwide.'"
"'06-09-27,'1','Two years ago, the Knicks had their own across-the-Hudson marketing idea, buying ad space on New Jersey Transit trains and platforms, and on billboards in the northern and central parts of the state.The Nets are trying to build on their belief that they can become a regional team, hoping to keep fans going to Continental Arena as they plan their move to a glass-enclosed arena proposed for a site near downtown Brooklyn.“We want to stay true to our core audience in New Jersey, but also to give a sampling opportunity to fans across the river,” Yormark said.The Times Square billboards are part of an overall plan to raise the awareness of the Nets and, ultimately, to sell more season tickets. At this point last year, the team was on pace to sell 1,850 new season tickets. This year, Yormark said the Nets expected to sell 3,000 more.Sixty percent of the season-ticket base lives in New Jersey, he added.Another element of the campaign is the team’s first television advertising campaign in at least five years, with two commercials, one starring Carter, which will start running today, and a second one starring Kidd in November.The Carter ad includes the voice of Marv Albert, the Nets’ announcer on the YES Network, and an instrumental track from the song “Dirt Off Your Shoulder” by Jay-Z, the rapper, music executive and a part owner of the Nets. The lyrics of the popular song contain some notably foul language.Jay-Z figures in another one of the team’s ticket-selling tactics. Fans buying a package of tickets costing $85 and up for the Nets’ first three home games (Nov. 1 against the Raptors, Nov. 8 against the Jazz and Nov. 10 against the Heat) will receive a free copy of his new album, “Kingdom Come.”“We’ve never offered this kind of plan and never married sports and entertainment like this,” Yormark said.Yet another part of the marketing push will run for a month starting next week at the Secaucus Junction train station, where all the advertising will be Nets-related. In all, there will be 45 Nets signs with five train themes, including “The Conductor” (Kidd), “On Track for Three” (Jefferson) and “The Brakeman” (Jason Collins).'"
"'06-09-27,'1','VAN BUREN TOWNSHIP, Mich., Sept. 26 (AP) — The Visteon Corporation, the auto parts supplier, said Tuesday that it would not meet its financial targets for the rest of the year because of production cuts by automakers and other factors.Visteon, the former parts unit of Ford Motor, said it expected second-half sales to be about 10 percent lower than its first-half sales of $5.7 billion.The company did not say whether it still expected to earn a profit for the year.In August, Visteon predicted a 2006 profit of $170 million to $200 million, excluding interest, taxes and one-time items like revamping costs, with product sales around $11 billion.Automakers have cut production in response to waning consumer interest in the sport utility vehicles and pickups that dominate their lineups.Visteon attributed its lower outlook to those cuts and to a marketplace shift toward vehicles that get better gas mileage.Visteon said it would discuss how it plans to respond to the changes and would update its financial outlook for 2006 when it releases third-quarter results next month.'"
"'06-09-27,'1','In May, Mr. Geller, the chief executive of Strategic Hotels and Resorts, the real estate investment trust that has owned the Hyatt Regency since 1997, announced a plan to rehabilitate the hotel as part of an ambitious 20-acre project that would include a six-block park, public buildings and a jazz center. As originally envisioned, the park would replace the long-troubled mall, and municipal offices would move from the damaged City Hall to the 1989 Dominion Tower, the last office building to rise downtown.But the mall, the office tower and 3,000 parking spaces belong to the Hertz Investment Group. And Mr. Hertz, the chief executive, said he never had a written agreement to sell them to Strategic — a fact not disclosed when the project was made public. Mr. Hertz said this was like claiming to buy a corporate office building and then accusing the owner of being a bad company for not selling it. “I know it sounds crazy, but that’s just what happened to me.’’As is usually the case, the dispute hinges on price.“He’s got something he thinks is more valuable than someone else does,’’ said Mr. Geller, who has likened his $725 million project to the acclaimed Millennium Park in Chicago, where Strategic is based. “He wants a high price — and he wants his money now, far exceeding its current value.’’Strategic’s broker, Michael J. Siegel, an executive vice president of Corporate Realty, a regional company, estimated the combined value of the shopping center, the office building and the garage at no more than $50 million, well below Mr. Hertz’s valuation of more than $70 million. But Mr. Hertz said that rather than sell Dominion Tower, he intends to rent it to the city or find other office tenants.Mr. Hertz said Mr. Geller may just be stalling. “I’m very surprised they think now that I was asking too much money,’’ Mr. Hertz said. “I believe he hasn’t finished his deal yet. If it’s not done, what’s the point of making a deal with me at any price?’’New Orleans has experienced plenty of failed real estate projects over the years, and Mr. Geller’s plan to create a tourist magnet, which he said would generate thousands of jobs and pump billions of dollars into the city’s struggling economy, has met with some skepticism. He has committed $200 million of his company’s money and insurance proceeds to the project, but acknowledges that even with capital from a variety of other sources, a $225 million gap remains.Not incidentally, the project would also improve the prospects for the Hyatt Regency, which was fighting for customers even before the hurricane because it is not near the French Quarter or the Ernest N. Morial Convention Center. Strategic owns 19 other luxury hotels.Mr. Hertz also seemed to face many challenges when he began buying office buildings along Poydras Street, beginning with the 27-story Poydras Center. The market, though stable, did not seem to offer much opportunity for growth, causing real estate specialists to wonder, “What does he know that we don’t know?’’ said Greg Riera, a vice president at Jones Lang LaSalle, which manages two buildings on Poydras. “But the price was right.’’Just before Katrina, Mr. Hertz bought the Louisiana Land and Exploration Company Building, a 36-story tower at 909 Poydras (one of the city’s two best addresses) and the 32-story Texaco Center at 400 Poydras — from Equity Office Properties Trust, the large Chicago REIT. Equity Office, which still owns one complex in suburban Metairie, has been streamlining its portfolio and getting out of markets without robust job growth.Richard D. Kincaid, Equity Office’s chief executive, said that when his company bought the two buildings on Poydras Street in 1997, New Orleans was still a big regional oil and gas hub. “But then company after company exited and consolidated in Houston,’’ Mr. Kincaid said. “There was not a lot of industry other than tourism and that doesn’t generate a lot of jobs.’’ Equity Office sold the buildings for less than it paid for them, Mr. Kincaid said.Mr. Hertz’s leasing agent, Bryan Burns III, a senior vice president at Transwestern Commercial Services, described his client as a long-term investor. “He’s an entrepreneurial opportunistic buyer,’’ Mr. Burns said. “His horizon is not short term. He felt confident there would be substantial value enhancements.’’In the aftermath of the storm, the commercial office market has turned out to be one of the few bright spots in the city’s economy. In the prime downtown buildings, occupancy stands at 91.2 percent, up from 86.8 percent before the hurricane, according to Equity Office. Rents are beginning to rise and landlords are regaining the upper hand in the marketplace, although the higher rents are being offset by increased operating costs, especially for insurance, said Mr. Siegel of Corporate Realty.“Our office market has been flat for the past two decades,’’ he said. “If somebody had told me in October or November last year that we would have been at this point, I wouldn’t have believed it.’’Much of that gain can be attributed to the closing of the 487,000-square-foot Dominion Tower, which shrank the prime office market to 8.8 million square feet. Four second-tier buildings are also not expected to reopen. But most of the city’s major employers — including Shell Oil, Entergy and Dominion — returned, though usually with fewer workers. One downtown company, Chevron, is moving to the suburbs.Some of the demand downtown has come from government agencies, construction companies and engineering firms responding to the storm, but space is being leased at a slower pace than it was initially, said Brian Rourke, a broker with Latter & Blum, a local company.Ryan W. Sweet, an associate economist at Moody’s economy.com, said Katrina had not generated the number of recovery-associated jobs expected after a hurricane because so much of the local population was displaced and may never return.The city’s plight makes it all the more important to get the so-called Hyatt Jazz District built, with or without Mr. Hertz’s cooperation, Mr. Geller said. He said the project’s master planner, Thom Mayne, a Pritzker-Prize-winning architect, is working on new blueprints to reorient the project so that it does not have a dead mall in the middle of it.“I will not let the city down because of one man’s recalcitrance and belief that an asset is worth more than it’s worth,’’ Mr. Geller said.'"
"'06-09-27,'1','At the same time, Mr. Abe (pronounced AH-bay) said he wanted to improve relations with South Korea and China, which soured after Mr. Koizumi paid visits to a Shinto shrine honoring Japan’s war dead.Mr. Abe called on the leaders of South Korea and China to meet with him, something both countries refused to do with Mr. Koizumi. So far, Mr. Abe has been vague about whether he will visit the shrine.He told reporters that one goal of his administration was to revise Japan’s pacifist Constitution, written after World War II by American occupation forces, to permit a full-fledged military. He also indicated that he favored closer military cooperation with Washington. These goals have alarmed many here who worry that any upgrading of the status of the armed forces could damage ties with Asian neighbors, which fear a revival of Japanese militarism.After winning leadership of the governing party last week, Mr. Abe reportedly spent several days holed up in his country retreat near Mount Fuji, drawing up his cabinet. His choices, said Tomoaki Iwai, a professor of politics at Nihon University, and others, gave a decidedly hawkish bent to the new administration.Mr. Abe increased the number of advisers to the prime minister, adding new posts for national security, education and the issue of Japanese citizens kidnapped by North Korea. Many of his appointees are in their 50’s, a decade younger than most cabinet ministers in the past.One of the most watched appointments was to the new job of national security adviser, which went to Yuriko Koike, 54, a former television reporter. Ms. Koike has been a vocal supporter of the economic sanctions on North Korea linked to its refusal to provide more information on the fate of Japanese citizens kidnapped two decades ago.Another was the education adviser, Eriko Yamatani, 56, a critic of sex education and the teaching of “excessive” equality of the sexes in schools.The new state minister in charge of sex equality, Sanae Takaichi, 45, has opposed allowing women to have different legal family names from their husbands, a freedom women sued to win in the late 1980’s.The defense agency chief, Fumio Kyuma, a 65-year-old party veteran and a friend of Mr. Abe’s, and the foreign minister, Taro Aso, 66, who ran against Mr. Abe in last week’s leadership vote, retained their positions.There are few political heavyweights in top economic posts, reflecting what some economists and political scientists said was a shift in priorities toward foreign policy and national security. Mr. Koizumi, in contrast, filled economic posts with prominent reformers like Heizo Takenaka, a former economics professor credited with fixing Japan’s debt-ridden banking system.Mr. Abe said he wanted to continue Mr. Koizumi’s market-oriented reforms but also pledged to fight the growing discrepancies in incomes and opportunities that they have helped create. Mr. Koizumi’s critics blasted him for turning egalitarian Japan into an American-style society of winners and losers.But Mr. Abe seemed to speak most forcefully on security issues, and on the need for Japan to have a larger voice in global affairs. One of his goals, he said, will be getting Japan a permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council.'"
"'06-09-27,'1','The opening line of the Yevtushenko poem says, “No monument stands over Babi Yar.” By telephone last week, Mr. Yevtushenko, now a distinguished professor at the University of Tulsa in Oklahoma, said that Shostakovich had “created the first great monument to Babi Yar: sound.”A stone sculpture was eventually placed there. Mr. Yevtushenko, who will appear at the concert, said his answer to the question of how the world had changed since he wrote “Babi Yar” was in a poem he wrote last month, “The Boy Named Babi Yar.”The idea for the poem began with a letter Mr. Yevtushenko received some years ago from an Israeli couple who had named their son Babi Yar. “The Boy Named Babi Yar” ends by wishing that Babi Yar and an Arab teenager “will come both together to Shostakovich, to his music, mighty and tender, and they will be embraced maternally by the Symphony No. 13.”The museum’s director, David Marwell, is not a musicologist. But he wrote his doctoral dissertation on Ernst Hanfstaengl, a German-American who became a high-ranking official in Hitler’s propaganda ministry and, later, an informer for American and British intelligence.From his research, Mr. Marwell knew that Mr. Hanfstaengl had played Liszt’s piano transcriptions of Wagner. That — and the fact that the museum had just bought a Fazioli concert grand — gave him an idea.“The notion occurred to me that there must be a transcription of the Shostakovich piece,” Mr. Marwell said. “Lo and behold, a not very sophisticated search of the Internet turned up a very obscure listing of a two-piano transcription.”The Internet search turned out to be the easy part. “The only copy of this piece existed in the hands of the second wife of Shostakovich,” Mr. Marwell said.He soon learned why it existed: “Babi Yar” had needed the censors’ approval. “Instead of assembling a huge orchestra, he transcribed the orchestral piece for two pianos,” Mr. Marwell said.“Babi Yar,” the full orchestral version, was performed on Dec. 18, 1962, with Kirill Kondrashin conducting the Moscow Conservatory Orchestra. Shostakovich scholars say that a planned television broadcast was canceled, and that despite a standing ovation, the concert rated only a single sentence in Pravda.Soviet officials long refused to acknowledge what had happened at Babi Yar and often arrested Jews who went there to pray. “For many people,” Mr. Marwell said, “Auschwitz is a symbol of the Holocaust, but for many Jews who have roots in the former Soviet Union, Babi Yar looms as large, because many Jews in the Soviet Union were killed in individual shooting actions, of which Babi Yar was the largest.”Shostakovich, whom the Communist Party denounced in the 1930’s and 40’s, had been rehabilitated and had joined the party. As his biographer Bernd Feuchtner has written, Shostakovich “threw in his lot with Yevtushenko, a poet who, like Shostakovich himself, showed his ‘solidarity’ by adopting a revolutionary tone and by criticizing the system from the inside.”The soprano Galina Vishnevskaya described hearing Shostakovich play “Babi Yar” for Mr. Kondrashin and the composer Aram Khachaturian a few months before the performance. Mr. Yevtushenko was there too; as Ms. Vishnevskaya wrote of him in her 1984 autobiography, “Galina,” “ ‘Babi Yar’ had raised him to Olympus in a single day.”She recommended a bass, who agreed to sing the part, only to back out. She suggested another bass, Victor Nechipailo, who dropped out on the morning of the performance after a singer at the Bolshoi Opera was “ordered to ‘get sick,’ ” and Mr. Nechipailo was told to substitute for him.For Mr. Dichter the performance has particular meaning. His parents survived a close escape from Poland. At one point along the way, they stayed with a farmer and his wife who assured Nazi soldiers that Mr. Dichter’s mother was their daughter, and not Jewish. Mr. Dichter’s father was hiding under the bed with, as Mr. Dichter told the story, “potatoes almost rolling out that he was afraid would expose him.”And one of the censors Shostakovich faced in 1962, a Mme. Furtsova, was on the jury in 1966 when Mr. Dichter won a silver medal at the Tchaikovsky Competition in Moscow.When the program’s artistic producer, Stephen Vann, asked if the Dichters knew the “Babi Yar” Symphony, they answered no. Mr. Dichter said Mr. Vann told them, “We don’t have the music, and there is no guarantee Mrs. Shostakovich will ever release it.”While the museum was seeking the necessary permissions, the Dichters found a one-piano version. “How much more could there be?” Mr. Dichter said. “It turns out, a lot. There are a lot of violin noodles.”'"
"'06-09-27,'1','POPPING a fiery jalapeño into your mouth might earn you points for bravado. But that jolt of heat, produced by the compound capsaicin, isn’t all there is to chilies. That fire can obscure what lies beneath, and what can be brought out in cooking chilies: a palette of flavors and perfumes, unique and varied.One way to understand and appreciate those flavors is to taste some peppers.Dried chili is easy: a taste can be a small bit or a pinch of chili flakes.For fresh peppers, the place to start is with a tiny bite from the pointed end, because the stem end is hotter. You want to avoid the seeds and veins because they carry the most fire. If the chili is a hot one, the bite can be as minuscule as a pinhead.If you sniff, chew and suck on the morsel, you can explore its taste and aroma as you would with wine or cheese. Some flavors jump out, while others linger in the background. Scotch bonnet peppers, and habanero varieties like the Grenada, for instance, are known for their powerful heat. But they also have a fruity, minty flavor that is present in Jamaican jerk dishes.Other fresh chilies may have a whiff of banana or sweet red pepper, citrus, tomatoes or herbs.The spectrum of dried chilies, such as the ancho, mulato and guajillo, offer an even more complex range of flavors, as they dance from chocolaty, smoky, dusky, anise-y and raisiny, to cinnamon-scented or even cherrylike.'"
"'06-09-27,'1','The history of the case, Justice Wittner said, “leads to the inescapable conclusion” that Mr. Morales’s due process rights under the State Constitution had been violated by the 15-year wait to indict him for murder.The Palladium case has been one of the most convoluted and controversial prosecutions in New York City in the last 15 years, so much so that Mr. Morgenthau’s opponent in the last race for district attorney, Leslie Crocker Snyder, made a campaign issue of her belief that he had prosecuted the wrong men.Mr. Morales could not be reached for comment, but his lawyer, Richard Verchick, marveled at his release. “This case is once in a lifetime,” Mr. Verchick said, “because to begin with, it’s so peculiar, and so odd, and dismissing a murder is extremely rare.”Asked whether his client was involved in the Palladium shooting, Mr. Verchick said: “At this point, after so many years, it’s impossible to know what happened. I don’t think anybody can know.”In what a defense lawyer said was the ultimate irony, one of the suspects some investigators now believe is innocent — David Lemus, whose conviction was overturned last year — will be retried for the same murder on Nov. 13, while Mr. Morales, who some investigators contend was the real murderer, has gone home to his family.Mr. Lemus’s lawyer, Steven M. Cohen, a former assistant federal prosecutor, who has been crusading for more than a decade to clear his client, was incredulous at the release of Mr. Morales, and lashed out at Mr. Morgenthau.“When you play games with who you arrest and when you arrest them, this is the consequence,” Mr. Cohen said. “Lemus, who many of us believe is an innocent man, is scheduled to go to trial, and everyone agrees that a killer was just released and is walking the streets of New York.”“Where was the D.A.’s office in 1990, in 1992, in 2000 and in 2004, when people who understood this case were telling them, ‘You’ve got the wrong guys?’ ” Mr. Cohen asked.Mr. Morgenthau declined to comment yesterday, and his spokeswoman said his office had not yet determined whether to appeal the ruling.But Dan Bibb, a former assistant district attorney who reinvestigated the case for Mr. Morgenthau in 2003, defended the district attorney. “The purpose was to get at the truth, not to defend two convictions,” said Mr. Bibb, now a defense lawyer. “There was never any evil intent on the part of the D.A.’s office.”He said that he believed Mr. Morales, who was indicted in April 2005, was guilty, and that he would keep his thoughts about Mr. Lemus to himself.In her decision, Justice Wittner said that within a week of the Palladium murder, an anonymous tip to the police reported that there were two gunmen: one named Spanky, which is Mr. Morales’s nickname, and a man named Joey. The informant said the two drove a blue Oldsmobile, as Mr. Morales was known to. They were said to hang out around 139th Street and St. Ann’s Avenue in the Bronx, Mr. Morales’s home turf.By October 1991, she said, four witnesses to the crime had identified Mr. Morales in a photo array, yet he still was not a suspect.On Dec. 2, 1992, a jury convicted Mr. Lemus and Olmedo Hidalgo of murdering the bouncer, Marcus Peterson. Prosecutors said they were among several people involved in the shooting on Nov. 23, 1990.Questions about their guilt arose in 1994, when Mr. Cohen, then a federal prosecutor, debriefed a gang member, Joey Pillot, who was facing federal murder and racketeering charges. After several meetings, Mr. Pillot, who was seeking to strike a deal with prosecutors, admitted that he and Mr. Morales had been at the Palladium, and identified Mr. Morales as the killer. This was believed to be the same “Joey” mentioned by the informant who spoke of Mr. Morales shortly after the shooting.Mr. Cohen and a detective, Robert Addolorato, began a 10-year crusade to clear Mr. Lemus and Mr. Hidalgo, and a judge overturned the convictions of the two men last year. Prosecutors decided not to retry Mr. Hidalgo. But they said they had always contended that there were several shooters, and that the involvement of Mr. Morales did not preclude that Mr. Lemus was one of them.'"

"'06-09-28,'1','“This debate is bringing Republicans back into the political process,” said Representative Tom Cole of Oklahoma, who is a contender to be the next leader of the Republican Congressional campaign committee. “If we’re going to have an election where swing voters are the main concern, I’ll be happy to talk about national security.”Republican leaders also criticized the 160 House Democrats, including Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the minority leader, who voted Wednesday against a measure sought by President Bush to change the conditions for trying and questioning terrorism suspects.The House speaker, J. Dennis Hastert, Republican of Illinois, said, “The same terrorists who plan to harm innocent Americans and their freedoms would be coddled, if we followed the Democratic plan.”Democrats made clear that even though many of them opposed the bill, they would not block it from becoming law, a distinction that they believe will make it more difficult for the White House to use this vote against them.If anything this week, the back-and-forth between the parties — on the intelligence report, on the bills and on the war itself — seemed to produce at best a muddled result, rather than the sharp contrast that the White House had sought.Democrats have watched with concern as Mr. Bush hammered his arguments on Iraq and terrorism.There are new indications that Democrats regard the intelligence report as an opportunity to undercut what had been a main argument of Mr. Bush.It took Democrats barely three days to seize on the intelligence findings in a new television advertisement in one of the most contested races in the country, the challenge to Representative Nancy L. Johnson, Republican of Connecticut, who supports the war. The campaign of Ms. Johnson’s opponent, Christopher Murphy, began broadcasting the commercial, which says, “President Bush’s war in Iraq has increased the threat of terrorism and made us less secure here at home.”Representative Rahm Emanuel of Illinois, who is leading the Democrats’ campaign to win Congress, said the intelligence assessment undercut the White House attempt to move the election from Iraq and to stronger Republican ground, terrorism.“They had a strategy for this fall to be about national security, and the entire debate this week has turned into the president’s failure in Iraq,” Mr. Emanuel said. “That is not where they want to be right now.”Republicans disputed the argument that the events were as significant or damaging as Democrats said. Nevertheless, the events were the latest indication that Democrats now see the war in Iraq as an issue that can help them win critical districts and that candidates and party leaders would, unlike in the elections of 2002 and 2004, challenge any attempt by the White House to claim primacy on the issue of terrorism.Jim Jordan, a Democratic analyst, argued that Republicans were paying a price for having linked the Iraq war to terrorism in previous campaigns.“They would rather talk about terrorism than Iraq,” Mr. Jordan said. “The problem they have got is they formed a linkage between the two that helped them in ’04 and hurt them in ’06.”In pushing back and trying to gain dominance in the debate, Republicans made two arguments. The first was that Democrats were purposely mischaracterizing what the report said.“The key passage in the National Intelligence Estimate declassified and released yesterday was that for us to cut and run in Iraq would simply embolden our enemy in a way that they were emboldened when we left Somalia,” said Senator John Cornyn, Republican of Texas.The second was to suggest that Democrats were trying to exploit intelligence for political gain and to insinuate that they were responsible for leaking the information.“The purpose of the leak was to distort the premise of the National Intelligence Estimate to try to lend weight to the Democratic argument that the war in Iraq does not really matter, we are losing the war in Iraq, and it doesn’t have anything to do with the war on terror,” said Senator Christopher S. Bond, Republican of Missouri.It was too soon to tell, aides to both parties said Wednesday, whether the arguments will hold much sway with voters, much less break through all the arguments occurring here and in Congressional campaigns at home.Yet one thing was clear. Republicans were not talking about what they wanted to be talking about. And at a time when Democrats are trying to turn the debate from national security, where they are not strong, to the war, which is Mr. Bush’s weakness, the intelligence reports provided what Democrats said was a weapon that they very much needed.“We are less safe today because of the Iraq war,” said Senator Charles E. Schumer, the New York Democrat who is Mr. Emanuel’s Senate counterpart. “That is a very trenchant argument.”'"
"'06-09-28,'1','McDonald’s raised its annual dividend yesterday by 49 percent, to $1 a share, part of a push by the company to return billions of dollars to its shareholders.McDonald’s shares were up 76 cents, or 2 percent, to close at $39.82 in regular trading.

"'06-09-28,'1','In a sign that drug companies may be reaching the limits of how high they can price cancer drugs, Amgen won approval yesterday for its colorectal cancer drug Vectibix and set the price 20 percent below that of ImClone Systems’ Erbitux, a very similar product.The move by Amgen appeared to be both a competitive strategy and an acknowledgment of recent public concerns about the costs of some of the newest cancer drugs, which run tens of thousands of dollars a year.“Given the nature of scrutiny now on oncology therapeutics,” Jim Daly, the senior vice president for North American commercial operations, said in an interview, “we thought the best policy was a meaningful discount on Erbitux.”Still, Vectibix will cost $4,000 for an infusion every two weeks, or more than $100,000 for a year’s treatment, though most of the patients for whom the drug is approved are expected to survive only a few months.Dr. Leonard B.

It is a baby step in the right direction.”'"
"'06-09-28,'1','In some ways, the opera affair galvanized the meeting — underlining the urgency and complexity of the issues facing Germany, as it seeks to integrate a Muslim population that is growing in size and, in the view of some, growing farther apart from mainstream German society.“There was general agreement that we would like to see the opera come back,” said Mehmet Yildirim, the general secretary of the Turkish-Islamic Union. “But there were different perspectives on the issue.”He said that while the atmosphere on Wednesday was positive, he was less sure that Germany and its Muslim population would be able to work together over a period of years to solve their more basic differences.The conference, which had been planned soon after Angela Merkel was elected chancellor last fall, comes at a time of heightened debate over whether Germans have been too quick to compromise their values in the face of anger, or merely the threat of anger, on the part of Muslims.Even before the cancellation of the opera, there were misgivings here about the repeated expressions of regret by Pope Benedict XVI, a German, for his recent remarks about Islam and violence.On Wednesday, Mrs. Merkel added her voice to a chorus of political and cultural leaders who criticized the Deutsche Oper.“I think the cancellation was a mistake,” she said to reporters. “Self-censorship does not help us against people who want to practice violence in the name of Islam. It makes no sense to retreat.”A top cultural official in Berlin, Thomas Flierl, said the city would like to stage “Idomeneo” as soon as possible. The Deutsche Oper said it was open to rescheduling it, provided that a “suitable date” could be found. On Tuesday, the director of the opera house, Kirsten Harms, said she would first have to resolve the political and diplomatic implications.Ms. Harms has been roundly scorned. But critics said the Berlin government, particularly its chief security official, Ehrhard Körting, should have given her more advice.At the conference, the issues were no less sensitive, ranging from the teaching of Islamic religion in public schools to the training of imams in Germany, and from the construction of mosques to the discrimination against Muslims living in this country, the majority of whom are of Turkish origin.The meeting was a necessary step because the government needs to get a feel for the Islamic point of view, said Ayyub Axel Köhler, chairman of the Central Council of Muslims.Complicating attempts at dialogue, Muslims in Germany are a fractured group. The government took note of that by inviting independent figures like Seyran Ates, a Turkish-German lawyer who represents victims of domestic abuse. Mr. Schäuble, an experienced and influential member of Mrs. Merkel’s Christian Democratic Party, supports teaching Islam in schools. But he also insists that Muslim schoolgirls be allowed to take physical education — an activity some conservative Muslim families resist.Mr. Schäuble, who oversees antiterrorism policy, warned Muslim leaders that they must abide by the German Constitution and the principles of a democratic society if they wanted to be included in the conference.In an interview with Der Spiegel this week, he made clear the limits of his tolerance. “I can promise you this,” he said, “anyone who calls me an infidel at the conference will be in for a fight.”The session was closed to the news media, but judging by the conciliatory tone afterward, it did not seem likely that anybody called him one.'"
"'06-09-28,'1','What soothes the Yankees about having Sheffield at first is that he would be replacing Jason Giambi, who is no defensive clone of Don Mattingly. Giambi, who has tendinitis in his left wrist, is a plodding fielder with a tendency to rush when throwing the ball. Between Giambi and Sheffield, Sheffield is the better athlete and, presumably, the sounder choice at first.When Sheffield first discussed the possibility of playing first last month, he smiled and said: “Who is playing first base for us? If he can do it, I can do it.”Sheffield, a fiercely proud athlete who expects to play, started his sixth game at first last night after missing 101 games because of wrist surgery. Torre used the lineup that he will probably start in the postseason in a 16-5 victory over the Baltimore Orioles last night. Sheffield was at first and had two hits while Giambi, the designated hitter, had a homer and two singles while driving in four runs.Torre said he would soon decide if Sheffield or Giambi would be at first in the playoffs, but indications were that his choice would be Sheffield. Giambi said that his wrist injury had been aggravated by playing first and he was uncertain if he would play there again in the regular season. Meanwhile, Torre left Sheffield in for an entire game Tuesday and speculated about whether he would even need to replace Sheffield for defense in the later innings.“He’s a guy who has no fear of making a mistake, which is important when you’re playing a new position,” Torre said.Could Torre be acting greedy by starting Sheffield at first and favoring offense over defense? As formidable as the Yankee lineup is, Torre could start Andy Phillips, his choice for a late-inning defensive replacement this season, and feel more secure about avoiding mistakes at first. With Chien-Ming Wang, a groundball pitcher, starting Game 1, infield defense will be important. But Torre said that by starting Phillips he would be letting an upgrade in defense “override any offense,” and he will not do that. Torre said that the strategy would fizzle if the Yankees were trailing because Sheffield would pinch hit for Phillips.Sheffield repeated that he hoped playing first would come naturally. But, when asked how something he has rarely done could feel natural, he reiterated that he would have to rely on his athletic ability. Sheffield bobbled three grounders last night, but recovered to get all three outs.As Sheffield is figuring out a new position, he is also trying to return to being a menacing hitter.Sheffield, who is 5 for 19 with two runs batted in since being activated from the disabled list, does not yet have his robust bat speed. But Torre praised Sheffield for hitting the ball up the middle and said he did not have to prove anything more to secure a postseason lineup spot.Tino Martinez, the former Yankee first baseman who once played against Sheffield as a Little Leaguer in Tampa, Fla., said Sheffield’s athleticism would buoy him as he made the transition.Martinez said that Sheffield’s toughest play would be throwing to second to begin a double play and then retreating to cover first. In addition, Martinez said Sheffield must get acclimated to the speed with which the ball reaches him, and that he should expect teams to bunt on him.“If he had a whole year to work on moving to first, he’d be great at it,” Martinez said. “But he’s got 10 games, so it’s a little more difficult. He’s got to get as comfortable as he can by seeing as many balls off the bat as he can.”During batting practice Tuesday, Sheffield received a tutorial from Craig Wilson, a backup first baseman. Wilson said he showed Sheffield some aspects of playing the position that Sheffield might not have known.Wilson spoke to Sheffield about keeping his right hand close to his glove after catching a grounder so he is in better position to throw. When he noticed that Sheffield was brushing the base with his right foot on throws to first, Wilson suggested that Sheffield move the foot deeper onto the base to give him more balance.“Basically, it’s just something you have to get used to,” Wilson said. “I was just trying to talk to him about different situations. He has to do whatever makes him the most comfortable.”Since Sheffield has been playing first for less than a week, he will not be as comfortable as Giambi, Wilson, Phillips or Miguel Cairo wearing a first basemen’s mitt, which Sheffield borrowed from Wilson.But Sheffield is one of the Yankees’ best offensive players. He said he had never stepped on a field where he was nervous about playing defense, not at any level or at any position. Soon, he will get the chance to prove that at first base in the playoffs with the Yankees.“I want the ball,” Sheffield said. “I want it hit at me. Really, I do. I believe I’m going to catch everything.”'"

But the United States and Europe fear that the enrichment activity is part of a nuclear weapons program.'"
"'06-09-28,'1','Verizon Communications gave its first in-depth answers yesterday to financial questions about the fiber optic network it is building, in a report that reassured analysts but appeared to unnerve investors.Verizon said it would spend $23 billion on its fiber optic network by 2010. By then, about 18 million households, or more than half the homes in Verizon’s territory, will have access to the network, which provides phone, broadband and television on one thin wire.Verizon has been installing fiber in 16 states for several years and its network passes 4.5 million homes. The company said that 500,000 customers now get their broadband over that network. Another 100,000 consumers have signed up for Verizon’s television service, which sells for as low as $40 a month.Both subscriber figures were better than many analysts had expected. Analysts also expect competition between Verizon and cable and satellite companies.Verizon is spending heavily on installation. It spends an average $873 to reach each customer’s curb with fiber and another $933 to connect the home to the network. Verizon expects to cut those figures by about 25 percent by the end of the decade.Investors appeared to be skeptical about Verizon’s plans. The shares fell $1.18, or 3.1 percent, to $36.78.'"
"'06-09-28,'1','ISLAMABAD, Pakistan, Sept. 27 (AP) — The top operative of Al Qaeda who is accused of masterminding the Sept. 11 attacks either killed or took part in killing the Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl, President Pervez Musharraf of Pakistan said in his new book, the first time he has made such a statement.General Musharraf wrote that the Qaeda operative, Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, took part in the killing of Mr. Pearl in Pakistan’s largest city, Karachi, after the journalist’s kidnapping on Jan. 23, 2002. Mr. Mohammed was arrested in Pakistan in 2003 and is in American custody in Guantánamo Bay, Cuba.“The man who may have actually killed Pearl or at least participated in his butchery, we eventually discovered, was none other than Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, Al Qaeda’s No. 3,” General Musharraf wrote in “In The Line of Fire,” released Monday.His statement could be used to try to clear Ahmed Omar Sheikh, one of four Islamic militants convicted in the killing, who is appealing his death sentence, the prisoner’s lawyer said Wednesday.Mr. Mohammed has never been officially linked to Mr. Pearl’s killing, during police investigations or the trial that resulted in the conviction of the four men. One of the men was sentenced to death, and the other three to life in prison.But some American officials and The Wall Street Journal suggested that Mr. Mohammed had killed Mr. Pearl. Pakistan denied the claims at the time.'"
"'06-09-28,'1','Convicted in 1949 by a federal jury in San Francisco on one of eight vaguely worded counts, she was sentenced to 10 years in prison and a $10,000 fine. She served six years and two months, then lived quietly in Chicago, running a family gift shop. On Jan. 19, 1977, she was pardoned, without comment, by President Gerald R. Ford on his last full day in office, and her citizenship was restored.“A mere wartime myth, Tokyo Rose was to become a disgrace to American justice,” Edwin O. Reischauer, the American ambassador to Japan from 1961 to 1966 and a scholar at Harvard specializing in East Asian affairs, wrote in his introduction to “Tokyo Rose: Orphan of the Pacific,” by Masayo Duus.The treason charges, Mr. Reischauer wrote, were “egged on by a public still much under the influence of traditional racial prejudices and far from free of the anti-Japanese hatreds of the recent war.”Iva Ikuko Toguri was born in Los Angeles on the Fourth of July, 1916, a daughter of Japanese immigrants who owned a grocery store. She graduated from the University of California, Los Angeles, in 1940 with a degree in zoology, hoping to become a physician.In the summer of 1941, she visited an ailing aunt in Tokyo at the request of her mother. When the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor, she was stranded in Tokyo, knowing virtually no Japanese, deprived of a food ration card by the authorities after refusing to become a Japanese citizen and hard pressed to find work.In 1942, she obtained a job with Japan’s Domei news agency, monitoring American military broadcasts, and late in 1943 she became an announcer and disc jockey for Radio Tokyo’s propaganda broadcasts, playing American musical recordings on the “Zero Hour” program beamed to American servicemen. She called herself Ann or Orphan Ann, short for announcer and a play on the Orphan Annie character.While continuing to work for Radio Tokyo in 1945, she married Felipe D’Aquino, a Domei news agency employee with Portuguese citizenship and Japanese ancestry.When the war ended, several American reporters learned of Mrs. D’Aquino’s broadcasts and interviewed her in Japan. She said she was Tokyo Rose, evidently presuming no great notoriety would be attached to that and perhaps hoping to embellish an intriguing story for American readers, having been paid for her account in a magazine article.She subsequently denied ever having called herself Tokyo Rose in her broadcasts, and no evidence was produced to the contrary.As an outgrowth of the publicity, Mrs. D’Aquino was arrested and questioned by American military occupation authorities and the Federal Bureau of Investigation. United Press quoted her at the time as saying, “I didn’t think I was doing anything disloyal to America.”In the fall of 1946, Mrs. D’Aquino was released from custody in Japan after the Army and the Justice Department concluded that there were no grounds for prosecuting her. But the Justice Department reopened the case in 1948. Loyalty issues were becoming a national political flash point, although mainly in the context of the cold war, and the American Legion and the powerful columnist and broadcaster Walter Winchell had spoken out against Mrs. D’Aquino.Mrs. D’Aquino, who had unsuccessfully sought permission from the American authorities to return to California, was arrested on charges of treason, transported to San Francisco, held in a county jail for a year, then put on trial in 1949.Treason, the only crime outlined in detail in the Constitution, is defined as “levying war” against the United States or giving aid and comfort to its enemies. A defendant may be convicted only “on the testimony of two witnesses to the same overt act, or on confession in open court.”Up to the end of World War II, there had been only about 30 treason cases in United States history. When Mrs. D’Aquino went on trial, five Americans had been convicted of treason for actions in the war, four having broadcast for Nazi Germany, most notably Mildred Gillars, known as Axis Sally.Tom DeWolfe, a special assistant attorney general, told the jury that Mrs. D’Aquino had engaged in “nefarious propagandistic broadcasts” without being under duress. Former supervisors for Radio Tokyo testified that she had made propaganda broadcasts willingly, and a few broadcast tapes were played for the jury, though none were identified as containing Mrs. D’Aquino’s voice.Testifying at the 12-week trial, Mrs. D’Aquino denied that she had ever made any disloyal statements on Radio Tokyo. She was supported in testimony from former Allied prisoners of war who had worked in the Japanese broadcasting operation. In a statement that she had given to the F.B.I. in Japan and that was entered in the court record, she said that she had sought to reduce the programs’ effectiveness as propaganda by inserting double meanings in some of her broadcasts.Mrs. D’Aquino was convicted on a single count of treason, relating to a broadcast she was alleged to have made to American servicemen in October 1944, referring to the loss of their ships. According to prosecution testimony, she said: “Orphans of the Pacific, you really are orphans now. How will you get home now that all your ships are lost?”After serving her sentence at the federal penitentiary for women in Alderson, W.Va., Mrs. D’Aquino fought government efforts to deport her. She ran an Asian grocery store and gift shop on Chicago’s North Side that family members had opened after their release from a wartime internment camp in Arizona. Her husband returned to Japan after her trial, and she never saw him again.President Ford pardoned Mrs. D’Aquino after she appealed to him in writing. The decision was supported by a unanimous vote of the California State Legislature, the national Japanese-American Citizens League, and S. I. Hayakawa, a United States senator-elect from California.“It is hard to believe,” Mrs. D’Aquino said on receiving word of President Ford’s action. “But I have always maintained my innocence — this pardon is a measure of vindication.”'"

The chemical security legislation we negotiated will give the secretary of homeland security new authority to set mandatory standards for high-risk chemical plants and, equally important, to enforce those standards.The bill gives the secretary the strongest possible authority: the power to shut down dangerous plants.Current law leaves dangerous gaps in our security because it does not empower the secretary to set standards or to close noncompliant plants. Our legislation closes those gaps.For your editorial to assert that Congress has done nothing to protect Americans from a terrorist attack on chemical plants is off the mark.We prevailed in including provisions fought by the chemical industry’s trade associations.

"'06-09-28,'1','Apparently as part of that investigation, Bronx authorities began listening to Mr. Kerik’s conversations, including several in which Ms. Pirro asked him to undertake the grunt work of the average private investigator, marital surveillance.Ms. Pirro yesterday did not deny the substance of the conversations as reported by WNBC. The station said that in a profanity-laced exchange, the two discussed whether Mr. Kerik’s company could place a recording device on her husband’s boat to capture evidence of any trysts.In the conversations, WNBC said, Ms. Pirro expressed frustration that her husband might be cheating on her.At one point, Ms. Pirro complained that an employee of Mr. Kerik seemed hesitant to plant a recording device and offered what she suggested was a plausible reason that workers might be on the boat.“We can just simply say, if there is an issue, that I am redecorating it for our anniversary,” Ms. Pirro said, according to the WNBC report.Mr. Kerik, WNBC said, spoke during the conversation with concern that recording conversations on the boat might be problematic, although the report did not specify what the problems were. “Everybody is panic-stricken because it’s you,” Mr. Kerik was quoted as telling Ms. Pirro.Ms. Pirro, swearing, said during one conversation that if need be, she would put the monitoring device on the boat herself.WNBC reported that Mr. Kerik, just minutes later, called an employee at Mr. Giuliani’s consulting firm and asked him to find a recording device. A spokeswoman for Mr. Giuliani, Sunny Mindel, declined to comment yesterday.Although federal prosecutors confirmed the existence of the investigation, they declined to comment yesterday on whether they believe a recording device was ever planted and used. Ms. Pirro said emphatically that none had been.Joseph Tacopina, a lawyer for Mr. Kerik, said yesterday that Mr. Kerik had done nothing wrong in discussing a possible investigation of a marital dispute.”I don’t think this is a problem. This is not a problem,” Mr. Tacopina said. “Bernie had his problems. He dealt with them in the Bronx.”Earlier this year, at the conclusion of the joint investigation by the Bronx district attorney’s office and the city’s Department of Investigation, Mr. Kerik pleaded guilty to two misdemeanors stemming from the apartment renovation. Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg ordered Mr. Kerik’s name removed from the city jail in Lower Manhattan that had been named in his honor.One person familiar with the conversations, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitive nature of the matter, said the Bronx district attorney’s office had provided tapes of the conversations to Janet DiFiore, the Westchester County district attorney. The tapes were later passed on to the Federal Bureau of Investigation and federal prosecutors in Manhattan. Spokesmen for the Bronx and Westchester County district attorneys’ offices would not comment.Mr. Pirro has been listed as owner of several boats in recent years. Current state records describe him as owning a 26-foot-long pleasure craft that is registered in his name only.In an afternoon news conference after the WNBC broadcast, Ms. Pirro characterized the federal investigation of her conversations with Mr. Kerik as politically motivated.Ms. Pirro and Mr. Kerik have a history of lending professional support to each other. Earlier this year, Mr. Kerik sent an e-mail message to friends urging them to support Ms. Pirro’s campaign.“Jeanine Pirro is a fighter,” Mr. Kerik wrote, according to a copy of the e-mail message obtained by The New York Times. “Smart, understanding and tough,” the message goes on, “she has dedicated her career to fighting crime and improving the lives of her fellow New Yorkers.”Several friends of Mr. Kerik have lost their jobs in the fallout from the investigations into his conduct, including the Correction Department’s longtime inspector general, Michael Caruso, and Thomas Antenen, Mr. Kerik’s spokesman at both the Correction and Police Departments.And the contractors accused of having played a role in the renovation of Mr. Kerik’s apartment, Peter and Frank DiTomasso, are under a felony perjury indictment for telling a Bronx grand jury that they had nothing to do with it.Federal investigators are still looking into other matters regarding Mr. Kerik, including his role in a Correction Department charity that spent $1 million in rebates on cigarettes bought with city money.'"
"'06-09-28,'1','Mr. Kramnik responded by steering play into the super-solid Semi-Slav Defense, with which he has had good results.Through 11 ... ba the game followed a tried-and-true path, but then Mr. Topalov went down a rarely used side street by playing 12 0-0, offering, at least temporarily, a pawn sacrifice.Mr. Kramnik did not bite, as he had in a 1994 game against Vasily Ivanchuk of Ukraine — a game Mr. Topalov must have studied in preparing for this match. Instead, Mr. Kramnik chose to continue to develop his pieces.Through 13 ... Nf6, the game was the same as one earlier this year between Ruslan Pogorelov of Ukraine and Reynaldo Vera of Cuba, but Mr. Topalov’s 14 Nd2 was a new and somewhat startling move. It offered up a speculative pawn sacrifice that Black could have accepted by playing 14 ... Ne4 15 Ne4 Bh2 16 Kh2 Qh4 17 Kg1 Qe4, but that would have led to a double-edged position after 18 f3 Qg6 19 Ba3, when Black would have to castle queenside and both players’ kings would come under attack. Given his lead in the match, Mr. Kramnik chose not to go in for such complications.After 14 ... Qc7, Mr. Topalov again offered a pawn, and this time Mr. Kramnik accepted. But after 21 Kg1, Black found himself in a somewhat passive position because of the limited scope of his bishop, so Mr. Kramnik returned the pawn to obtain more freedom.After 26 ... Rb8, Mr. Topalov could have tried 27 Ne5, then 27 ... Rb3 28 Nc6 Qd6 29 Rc1 Ra8 30 Qf3 Qf8 31 Ne7 Kh8 32 Qa8 Qa8 33 Ra7 Rb8 34 Ra8 Ra8, when White has an edge but Black may be all right.Instead of 38 Qc2, Mr. Topalov could have sacrificed a pawn by playing e4. After 38 ... fe 39 fe Qd3 40 Rd3 Bb3 41 Rc3, Black would have found himself in a difficult position as his bishop is immobilized. In all likelihood he would eventually have had to sacrifice his a pawn, restoring the material balance and leaving White with a better position, but probably still not enough to win.On 42 ... Qg5, 43 e4 would not have worked after 43 ... Bb3 44 Nb3 Rb3 45 Rb3 Rb3 46 Qb3 Qc1.Mr. Topalov continued to tack back and forth, hoping to create a weakness in Mr. Kramnik’s position, but Mr. Kramnik was able to play 48 ... f4, forcing a liquidation of Mr. Topalov’s center pawns and most of the remaining pieces. The final position was a dead draw.If Mr. Topalov had not got off to such a terrible start, he could feel reasonably happy about his play the last two days. As it stands, he must figure out a way to crack Mr. Kramnik’s solid defense, particularly when Mr. Kramnik has Black.Today is a rest day, and the match resumes tomorrow with Game 5.'"

"'06-09-29,'0','Beetle and ant larvae are all that’s for dinner as the beloved documentary series “Meerkat Manor” resumes tonight on Animal Planet. In the dry season, the female meerkats aren’t lactating. Baby Attila, only two inches tall, is playing too rough with his younger sister, Mango; he’s hyperaggressive (we’re told) because he’s so hungry. Maybe. Or maybe it’s because someone named him Attila.But let’s table, for now, the problems of anthropomorphism. Here in Meerkat Manor the conversion of meerkats to people for storytelling purposes is so complete, and so entertaining, that resistance is futile.“Meerkat Manor” has won fans for its close-ups of expressive meerkats and sweeping shots of their scrubby South African habitat and its broad bluebird-blue sky. But what clinches its status as first-rate nature television are its tales of animal-pack dynamics, the kind that send evolutionary-psych types into rapturous just-so stories about how human romantic tensions and office politics came to be.There is an alpha female, Flower, and an alpha male, Zaphod, who has sole mating rights with her. Youssarian, Zaphod’s brother, is the displaced macher meerkat, scheming about a comeback; he used to be a big deal until Zaphod displaced him. But now he again has to be kept in check, lest he make a run on Flower. Ha — just like that relationship in your dorm between Abby, Clyde and Boz, right?That’s the initial pleasure of “Meerkat Manor”: finding parallels with human life. But soon the comparisons don’t matter anymore: the alert little meerkats become engaging as themselves, and not merely as doppelgängers for humans. The narration, warmly delivered by the good-guy actor Sean Astin, also builds suspense and sympathy in a wonderfully unstrained way.But what if Youssarian joins the enemy clique, the Lazuli, by first scoring with Pancake, a recent refugee from that fearsome gang? (Nicks on her face indicate that she’s ungroomed and therefore solo.) That would show Zaphod, smug fat cat that he is. So Youssarian has sex with Pancake. But in the bright light of day, he recognizes her for what she is — a “lone, evicted female,” says Mr. Astin. “Although he likes Pancake,” Mr. Astin continues, about Youssarian, “she isn’t the only dish on the Kalahari menu.” Thus he bounds off, the rogue, looking for a higher-status Lazuli, “leaving her once again abandoned to a life of solitude.”'"

"'06-09-29,'0','Two of the OPEC oil cartel’s 11 members, Nigeria and Venezuela, said today that they would voluntarily cut production in response to declining crude oil prices, which have fallen 20 percent from their peak two months ago.The move, which would take less than 200,000 barrels of oil a day off the market, follows days of mixed signals from some OPEC officials, who have voiced increasing concern about the rapid drop in prices. Nigeria’s oil minister, Edmund Daukoru, who is president of OPEC this year, recently said the price of oil was “very low.”Nigeria and Venezuela, which have generally been price hawks within the group, said their decision to cut production grew out of an informal deal reached at OPEC’s last meeting, earlier this month, to pare output if prices fell steeply. Some OPEC representatives have grown anxious at the slide in the oil futures markets, where prices for benchmark contracts have fallen from a midsummer high of $77.03 a barrel.But traders shrugged off the announcement of the production cuts today. On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the most widely watched contract price — light, low-sulfur crude for delivery next month — traded this afternoon at $62.30 a barrel, down 0.7 percent.Mr. Daukoru has been in contact with other OPEC ministers to discuss prices, which on Monday briefly slipped below $60 a barrel for the first time in six months.

"'06-09-29,'0','Surgery is not required, Minaya said, and rest is the prescribed treatment. Martínez will need an estimated four to six weeks to heal, Minaya said.“There was no doubt he was banged up all year,” Minaya said. “I knew he wasn’t the regular Pedro.”David Wright said: “You see a guy who’s so dominant for so long, and you look in his face and in his eyes, and he knows that he’s hurting and can’t do anything about it.”The Mets juggled their rotation in September, adding a sixth starter so they could slot Martínez to pitch Game 1 in the division series. But in three starts since returning from the disabled list on Sept. 15, Martínez allowed 14 earned runs in 10 2/3 innings, and the ambiguity surrounding his status created a slight distraction in the clubhouse. Players wondered about his health and the postseason rotation. Who will pitch Game 1? Will Trachsel get a start? How about Maine? And when?“A lot of that stuff goes away now,” Glavine said. “And I think that we can start focusing on who the guys are that are going to be here, that are going to be able to pitch, that are going to try and help us win.”The Mets have no choice but to forge ahead without their most recognizable player, but the reality is stark nonetheless. Nearing the end of a captivating regular season, the Mets have hit their first major crisis. They can recoup from the loss of Martínez by starting someone else, but there is no way to replace the aura and swagger that he provided every time he stepped on the mound.No longer the overwhelming favorites to capture the N.L. pennant, the Mets are pinning their postseason aspirations on an aging rotation: a 40-year-old starter (Glavine), another who may be that old (Hernández) and a pitcher (Trachsel) whose high earned run average prompted questions about whether he would even make the roster at all even though he won 15 games. Their other potential starter, Maine, is a 25-year-old rookie who until the other day probably was not going to make the roster. Now he will.“It’s one of those things that if he were healthy, that’s a bonus, our ace in the hole,” closer Billy Wagner said. “The last two months we’ve been without Petey, and somehow we’ve won our division. We’re confident with what we have and we’re ready to go.”First and foremost is Hernández, the Mets’ No. 1 pitcher these days on merit, not default. He supplied a much-needed five uneventful innings Thursday, striking out nine and walking five while allowing an earned run in 102 pitches. Before this start, Hernandez was 2-2 since Aug. 20 with a 1.95 E.R.A., and opponents were batting .193 against him. Acquired to be a Band-Aid, Hernández is now holding the rotation together, and the Mets are counting on him to again be inspired by pitching in October.“I don’t feel good that Pedro won’t be with us, but I have to assume the responsibility that they give me,” said Hernández, with Julio Franco acting as his interpreter.Throughout this season, Martínez has defied his 180-pound frame, coming back from several injuries to pitch with aplomb. He needed a specially designed shoe to ease the pain in his right big toe, missed most of spring training, then went 5-0 in April.But after Martínez hurt his hip while slipping in a wet clubhouse in Miami in late May, his season gradually spiraled downward. He missed a month rehabilitating the hip, then fell ill with food poisoning, then strained his right calf on Aug. 14, and after weeping in the dugout after a poor start two weeks ago in Pittsburgh, he hit his lowest point Wednesday. His record dropped to 9-8 and his E.R.A. rose to a single-season high 4.48.Minaya said he did not expect Martínez to join the team in Washington, but he could be in the clubhouse next week, cheering on his teammates in a playoff series he can only watch. Asked before the game if he were surprised that Martínez could overcome his other ailments but not this one, Randolph brushed off the suggestion.There have been times when it does not seem that way. But on Thursday, the Mets were reminded of the painful truth.Carlos Delgado’s three-run double in the first inning ignited the Mets’ meek offense and led them to only their second victory in nine games. Carlos Beltrán blasted his 41st homer of the season, a solo shot in the sixth, tying Todd Hundley’s franchise record set in 1996. ... Despite returning to New York to receive a cortisone shot in his left ankle, Cliff Floyd was guaranteed a spot on the postseason roster by Willie Randolph. Floyd will join the team Friday in Washington and will play Saturday or Sunday.'"
"'06-09-29,'0','Iva Toguri D’Aquino was born in Los Angeles on the Fourth of July. She was, among other things, a daughter of immigrants, a graduate of the University of California, Los Angeles, and, as she fiercely insisted to those who doubted it, a true and loyal American.None of that helped her in the late 1940’s, when anti-Japanese sentiment was running strong in this country, and Mrs. D’Aquino was branded a traitor and became known to the world as Tokyo Rose.There was no “Tokyo Rose,” which was a label servicemen used for the dozen or so women who broadcast propaganda and popular music on Radio Tokyo, to the troops’ annoyance or amusement. Mrs. D’Aquino, who was visiting a relative in Tokyo in 1941 and became stranded there after Dec. 7, was one of them, though she denied ever saying anything disloyal. She was arrested but released in 1946 when the Army and Justice Department concluded they had no case against her. The case was reopened in 1948, in a cold war miscarriage of justice. She was convicted of treason and spent six years in prison.After her release, Mrs. D’Aquino lived in Chicago, helping to run a family shop on the North Side that sells origami paper, teapots, books and other Japanese goods. George Takei, the Japanese-American actor who has been trying to get the money to film a dramatized account of her life, said she embodied the quality known in Japanese as gaman, or restraint — the tendency “to hold it all in and be strong.” She kept the lowest of profiles, telling her story only rarely, as when she wrote a letter to President Gerald Ford, who pardoned her in 1977.The facts made the case for a pardon unarguable, but the legend outlived them. As Mr. Takei points out, explaining why he wants to make the movie: To people over 50, Mrs. D’Aquino is still Tokyo Rose, propagandist, traitor and spy. To people under 50, she’s — who?Mrs. D’Aquino, 90, died Tuesday in Chicago, a free, exonerated, exemplary American for more than five decades, but still imprisoned by a myth.'"
"'06-09-29,'0','The combination has left water all too scarce in some places, contaminated in others and in cursed surfeit for millions who are flooded each year. Today the problems threaten India’s ability to fortify its sagging farms, sustain its economic growth and make its cities healthy and habitable. At stake is not only India’s economic ambition but its very image as the world’s largest democracy.“If we become rich or poor as a nation, it’s because of water,” said Sunita Narain, director of the Center for Science and Environment in New Delhi.Conflicts over water mirror the most vexing changes facing India: the competing demands of urban and rural areas, the stubborn divide between rich and poor, and the balance between the needs of a thriving economy and a fragile environment.New Delhi’s water woes are typical of those of many Indian cities. Nationwide, the urban water distribution network is in such disrepair that no city can provide water from the public tap for more than a few hours a day.An even bigger problem than demand is disposal. New Delhi can neither quench its thirst, nor adequately get rid of the ever bigger heaps of sewage that it produces. Some 45 percent of the population is not connected to the public sewerage system.Those issues are amplified nationwide. More than 700 million Indians, or roughly two-thirds of the population, do not have adequate sanitation. Largely for lack of clean water, 2.1 million children under the age of 5 die each year, according to the United Nations.The government says that 9 out of 10 Indians have access to the public water supply, but that may include sources that are going dry or are contaminated.The World Bank, in rare agreement with Ms. Narain, warned in a report published last October that India stood on the edge of “an era of severe water scarcity.”“Unless dramatic changes are made — and made soon — in the way in which government manages water,” the World Bank report concluded, “India will have neither the cash to maintain and build new infrastructure, nor the water required for the economy and for people.”The window to address the crisis is closing. Climate change is expected only to exacerbate the problems by causing extreme bouts of weather — heat, deluge or drought.The fabled Yamuna River, on whose banks this city was born more than 2,000 years ago, is a case study in the water management crisis confronting India.In Hindu mythology, the Yamuna is considered to be a river that fell from heaven to earth. Today, it is a foul portrait of crippled infrastructure — and yet, still worshiped. From the bridges that soar across the river, the faithful toss coins and sweets, lovingly wrapped in plastic. They scatter the ashes of their dead.In New Delhi the Yamuna itself is clinically dead.As the Yamuna enters the capital, still relatively clean from its 246-mile descent from atop the Himalayas, the city’s public water agency, the New Delhi Jal Board, extracts 229 million gallons every day from the river, its largest single source of drinking water.As the Yamuna leaves the city, it becomes the principal drain for New Delhi’s waste. Residents pour 950 million gallons of sewage into the river each day.Coursing through the capital, the river becomes a noxious black thread. Clumps of raw sewage float on top. Methane gas gurgles on the surface.It is hardly safe for fish, let alone bathing or drinking. A government audit found last year that the level of fecal coliform, one measure of filth, in the Yamuna was 100,000 times the safe limit for bathing.In 1992, a retired Indian Navy officer who once sailed regattas on the Yamuna took his government to the Supreme Court. The retired officer, Sureshwar D. Sinha, charged that the state had killed the Yamuna and violated his constitutional right, as a practicing Hindu, to perform ritual baths in the river.Since then, the Supreme Court ordered the city’s water authority to treat all sewage flowing into the river and improve water quality. In 14 years, that command is still unmet.New Delhi’s population, now 16 million, has expanded by roughly 41 percent in the last 15 years, officials estimate. As the number of people living — and defecating — in the city soars, on average more than half of the sewage they pour into the river goes untreated.A government audit last year indicted the Jal Board for having spent $200 million and yielding “very little value.” The construction of more sewage treatment plants has done little to stanch the flow, in part because sewage lines are badly clogged and because power failures leave them inoperable for hours at a time.“It has not improved at all because the quantity of sewage is constantly increasing,” said R. C. Trivedi, a director of the Central Pollution Control Board, which monitors the quality of the Yamuna River. “The gap is continually widening.”Making matters worse, many New Delhi neighborhoods, like Janata Colony — Hindi for People’s Colony — are not even connected to sewage pipes. Open sewers hem the narrow lanes of the slum. Every alley carries their stench.Some canals are so clogged with trash and sludge that they are no more than green-black ribbons of muck. It is a mosquitoes’ paradise. Malaria and dengue fever are regular visitors.Not long ago, a 2-year-old boy named Arman Mustakeem fell into one such canal and drowned. His parents said they found him floating in the open sewer in front of their home.These canals empty into a wide storm drain. It, in turn, runs through the eastern edges of the city, raking in more sewage and cascades of trash, before it merges with effluent from two sewage treatment plants, and finally, enters the Yamuna.Carrying the capital’s waste on its back, the Yamuna meanders south to cities like Mathura and Agra, home to the Taj Mahal. It is their principal source of drinking water, too. New Delhi’s downstream neighbors are forced to treat the water heavily, hiking up the cost.With New Delhi slated to host the Commonwealth Games in 2010, the government proposes to remake this riverfront with a sports and recreation complex. In the meantime, the Yamuna, vital and befouled as it is, bears the weight of New Delhi’s ambitions.At dawn each morning, men sink into the still, black waters to retrieve whatever can be bartered or sold: rings from a dead man’s finger, coins dropped by the faithful, the remnants of rubber sandals, plastic water bottles.The dhobis, who launder clothes, line up on one stretch of riverbank, pounding saris and bedsheets on stone tablets. A man shovels sand from the river bottom: every bullock cart he fills for a cement maker will fetch him a coveted $5.50. Men and boys bathe.“This river is worshiped,” said a bewildered Sunny Verma, 24. “Is this the right way of worshiping it?”So shaken was Mr. Verma on his first visit to the Yamuna this year that he now works full time to shake up others. He joined an environmental group called We for Yamuna.“If you want to worship the river, you should give it more respect,” he said. “You should treat it the right way. You should question the government. You should ask the state to actually do something for the river.”Mrs. Prasher has the misfortune of living in a neighborhood on New Delhi’s poorly served southern fringe.As the city’s water supply runs through a 5,600-mile network of battered public pipes, 25 to 40 percent leaks out. By the time it reaches her, there is hardly enough.On average, she gets no more than 13 gallons a month from the tap and a water bill from the water board that fluctuates from $6 to $20, at its whimsy, she complains, since there is never a meter reading anyway.That means she has to look for other sources, scrimp and scavenge to meet her family’s water needs.She buys an additional 265 gallons from private tankers, for roughly $20 a month. On top of that she pays $2.50 toward the worker who pipes water from a private tube-well she and other residents of her apartment block have installed in the courtyard.Nearly a fourth of New Delhi households, according to the government commissioned Delhi Human Development Report, rely at least in some part on such wells. It is one of the principal reasons groundwater in New Delhi is drying up faster than virtually anywhere in the country: 78 percent of it is considered overexploited.Still, the new posh apartment buildings sprouting across New Delhi and its suburbs sell themselves by ensuring a 24-hour water supply — usually by drilling wells deep underground. “Imagine never being thirsty for water,” boasts a newspaper advertisement for one new development.Warning of “an unparalleled water crisis,” the study released in August found that 25 percent of New Delhi households had no access to piped water, and that 27 percent got water for less than three hours a day. Nearly two million households, the report also found, had no toilet.The daily New Delhi hustle for water only adds to the strains on the public system.A few years ago, for instance, to compensate for the low water pressure in the public pipeline, Mrs. Prasher and her neighbors began tapping directly into the public water main with so-called booster pumps, each one sucking out as much water as possible.It was a me-first approach to a limited and unreliable public resource, and it proliferated across this me-first city, each booster pump further draining the water supply.The situation for New Delhi, and all of India, is only expected to worsen. India now uses an estimated 829 billion cubic yards of water every year — that is more than guzzling an entire Lake Erie. But its water needs are growing by leaps. By 2050, official projections indicate, demand will more than double, and exceed the 1.4 trillion cubic yards that India has at its disposal.Yet the most telling paradox of the city’s water crisis is that New Delhi is not entirely lacking in water. The problem is distribution, hampered by a feeble infrastructure and a lack of resources, concedes Arun Mathur, chief executive of the Jal Board.The Jal Board estimates that consumers pay no more than 40 percent of the actual cost of water. Raising the rates is unrealistic for now, as Mr. Mathur well knows. “It would be easier to ask people to pay up more if we can make water abundantly available,” he said. A proposal to privatize water supply in some neighborhoods met with stiff opposition last year and was dropped.So the city’s pipe network remains a punctured mess. That means, like most everything else in this country, some people have more than enough, and others too little.The slums built higgledy-piggledy behind Mrs. Prasher’s neighborhood have no public pipes at all. The Jal Board sends tankers instead. The women here waste their days waiting for water, and its arrival sets off desperate wrestling in the streets.Kamal Krishnan quit her job for the sake of securing her share. Five days a week, she would clean offices in the next neighborhood. Five nights a week, she would go home to find no water at home. The buckets would stand empty. Finally, her husband ordered her to quit. And wait.“I want to work, but I can’t,” she said glumly. “I go mad waiting for water.”Elsewhere, in the central city, where the nation’s top politicians have their official homes, the average daily water supply is three times what finally arrives even in Mrs. Prasher’s neighborhood.Mrs. Prasher rations her water day to day as if New Delhi were a desert. She uses the leftover water from the dog bowl to water the plants. She recycles soapy water from the laundry to mop the balcony.And even when she gets it, the quality is another question altogether.Her well water has turned salty as it has receded over the years. The water from the private tanker is mucky-brown. Still, Mrs. Prasher says, she can hardly afford to reject it. “Beggars can’t be choosers,” she said. “It’s water.”'"
"'06-09-29,'0','An S.E.C. spokesman, John Nester, declined to comment. Isa Bolotin, head of investor relations at Pirate Capital, did not return calls seeking comment.Pirate is known for its unusually brash tactics and unabashed style. A New York magazine cover article reported that Zachary George, 27, an analyst with the firm and former competitive snowboarder, told the chief executive of the Cornell Companies, a prison operator, that “You work for us,” and that Mr. George and Pirate wanted Cornell sold and the chief executive sacked. “Next year we’re going to be here, and you won’t,” Mr. George told the chief executive, according to the article.Mr. Hudson said two investment professionals, including Mr. George, resigned on Monday. On Wednesday, Carl Klein, a portfolio manager, resigned, and Mr. Hudson asked two more analysts to leave. Five people, including Mr. Hudson, remain.Pirate, which uses terms like “shipwrecks” and “treasures” in its investor letters, is considered rare for its openness to publicity.Not all investors welcome that approach. “Any fund that promotes itself in the news indicates one of two things,” said Gordon C. Haave, director of investment and consulting at the Asset Services Company, a consulting firm. “That the fund manager is spending a lot more time worrying about his image in the community than about his investments, or two, that he is advertising to the rest of the world how everyone ought to copy his or her strategy.”The result, he said, was more money flowing into activist funds and the prospect of too many people chasing the same returns.According to documents provided to prospective investors, Pirate Capital was started in 2002 with $2 million by Thomas Hudson, who worked in the distressed-asset area at Goldman Sachs, and his wife, Gabrielle Katz Hudson, who was responsible for “legal transfer documentation for private assets” at Goldman. The same document says that Mr. Hudson sued Goldman Sachs for wrongful dismissal after being asked to leave the firm because of a “consensual extramarital affair with a co-worker.” That woman, according to the same document, became his wife, Gabrielle. The litigation, according to the document, was dismissed.The S.E.C. is investigating whether Pirate was late in reporting to the commission material changes in its holdings. Investors with at least a 5 percent stake must report any changes to those holdings.Some of Pirate’s top investments took a drubbing recently, after a significant rise at the end of August. For example, Cutter & Buck, the apparel company, traded from $9.40 up to $11.17 toward the end of August before falling back to $9.48 yesterday. Walter Industries, which Pirate owned 8.1 percent of at the end of August, rallied to $55.12 at the end of August and has fallen to $43.56. Strong month-end buying can reflect portfolio managers buying stock to push up prices. It is not clear what drove those two stocks.Regulators are increasingly concerned about “clustered” trades, or copycat trades among hedge funds, according to two regulators.Pirate has planned a call for Tuesday to address investor concerns.'"
"'06-09-29,'0','OTTAWA, Sept. 28 — Research In Motion, maker of the popular BlackBerry wireless e-mail device, said Thursday that it had begun an investigation into its handling of stock options.The news did not faze investors, who focused on the company’s higher-than-expected net profit of $140.8 million for the second quarter. R.I.M. also said its revenue was up 34 percent, to $658.5 million. The company’s share price soared nearly 20 percent in after-hours trading on the Nasdaq, after closing at $86.06.During a conference call, R.I.M. executives said that the company had added 705,000 customers during the quarter, for a total of 6.2 million. That increase, the company added, is continuing with an average of 60,000 new users signing up each week during the first three weeks of this month alone.R.I.M. delayed its second-quarter earnings announcement by 30 minutes because of the options review disclosure. The investigation also meant that the company was able to release only preliminary results for the period, which ended on Sept. 2.The company said that it would probably restate some of its earnings to correct accounting errors found by a “management-initiated, voluntary review.” It said it expected the options review to ultimately reduce its net earnings since 1997, when it became publicly traded, by $25 million to $45 million .Any changes are not likely to significantly alter current or future results, the company said.Research In Motion provided no details about the errors uncovered in its internal investigation. It is not clear if they involve backdating, in which the issuing of options is retroactively dated to a time of low share prices — a practice that has been a recent focus of investigations at dozens of companies.R.I.M., which is based in Waterloo, Ontario, said that because of “heightened public awareness and concern regarding stock option grant practices by publicly traded companies,” it decided to begin a review of its own practices.'"
"'06-09-29,'0','Mr. Kerkorian currently holds 56 million shares, for a 9.9 percent stake. He bought those shares at an average price of $31.50. At the $33.06 closing price Thursday of G.M. shares, Mr. Kerkorian is ahead approximately $84 million on his investment.Analysts said the additional shares would give Mr. Kerkorian more clout to demand an independent financial review of a possible deal.Carrie Bloom, a spokeswoman at Mr. Kerkorian’s company, the Tracinda Corporation, said that Mr. Kerkorian “continues to believe that a strong opportunity exists in a potential alliance between General Motors, Renault and Nissan, and that there should be strong General Motors board involvement in the analysis of such a potential alliance, including the utilization of independent advisers.”Mr. Kerkorian’s letter was included in a filing made to the Securities and Exchange Commission on Thursday. News of the letter prompted investors to bid up G.M.’s stock price by nearly 3 percent when trading opened Thursday morning on the New York Stock Exchange.Mr. Kerkorian’s move reflects his belief that G.M. is a good investment, his lawyer, Terry Christensen, said Thursday.“We’re encouraged by the opportunities in the company’s path,” Mr. Christensen said.John Murphy, an auto analyst with Merrill Lynch, said Mr. Kerkorian “may ultimately help facilitate the process” of reaching an agreement on an alliance. He said Mr. Kerkorian’s decision to buy more shares was positive news for G.M.’s stock.It was Mr. Kerkorian who tried to play matchmaker for the three companies. He met with Mr. Ghosn, who runs both Renault and Nissan, this summer to suggest that the three explore a global alliance. In early July, the three companies’ boards approved talks, which began July 14 in Detroit with a meeting between Mr. Ghosn and Mr. Wagoner.They met again in Paris on Wednesday, but the atmosphere has clearly soured.Indeed, G.M. executives at the Paris Motor Show Thursday said they felt the automaker’s turnaround from a $10.6 billion loss last year was progressing well, implying that there was no need to seek help with Renault and Nissan.Robert A. Lutz, G.M. vice chairman, said Thursday that G.M. operated “on a scale that dwarfs other companies combined, including those two companies that we are talking about.”The Renault-Nissan team reportedly estimates that $10 billion in savings could be generated by an alliance. “From a scale point of view, it makes sense,” said Thierry Moulonguet, chief financial officer at Renault.It was that gap in perception between G.M. and Renault-Nissan about the value of the deal, which came to light this week, that prompted Mr. Kerkorian to reiterate an earlier call he made for an outside financial review.But Frederick A. Henderson, G.M.’s chief financial officer, said his company’s own executives were more capable of assessing potential savings from an alliance than outside experts.“If you look at who is in a better position to evaluate the synergies of the project, we have already done it,” Mr. Henderson said.Mr. Kerkorian had signaled his intent to buy more shares earlier this year.In January, Jerome B. York, an adviser to Mr. Kerkorian, said his boss was “willing, under the right circumstances” to buy 12 million more shares. Those conditions included “aggressive and effective actions to improve the performance of the company,” and efforts by G.M. and the United Automobile Workers union to work more closely together.Tracinda had not said until Thursday that it would seek regulatory approval to buy the shares. The new shares would push Mr. Kerkorian’s stake over 10 percent, initiating the need for government approvals because G.M. owns banking and insurance interests.Other auto executives saw a more simple explanation behind Mr. Kerkorian’s bid to raise his stake. “He’s afraid Rick will say no” to a deal, said Dieter Zetshe, the chief executive at DaimlerChrysler. Mr. Kerkorian, once the largest shareholder at Chrysler, now holds less than 5 percent of its parent’s shares.Officials at General Motors said they got wind of the move Wednesday night. Mr. Lutz said that he was not surprised by it.Mr. Kerkorian began buying Chrysler shares while Mr. Lutz worked at that automaker during the 1990’s, and made a number of tactical moves to increase pressure on Chrysler officials to improve shareholder value.“I’ve arguably gone through it on the Chrysler side,” Mr. Lutz said in a brief interview. Mr. Lutz said he did not know whether to take Mr. Kerkorian’s letter as a tactic or as a compliment.“I’m not going to speculate on what I think it might be,” Mr. Lutz said.The move by Mr. Kerkorian came a day after Mr. Ghosn said he would still be interested in adding a North American partner if discussions with G.M. failed, raising the prospect of eventual talks with the Ford Motor Company.Mr. Ghosn met on Wednesday with Mr. Wagoner at Renault’s headquarters in Boulogne-Billancourt, a Paris suburb. The two executives said in written statements on Wednesday that the talks would continue until Oct. 14, the original date set in July.Mr. Lutz emphasized that G.M. was moving quickly to overhaul its North American business, a strategy it put into effect last year.“We are in the throes of a revolution at General Motors,” Mr. Lutz told reporters here.“For the first time in our almost 100-year history, during the last 18 months, we have gone from a loose financial grouping of four regional auto companies that had very little to do with each other, to being one unified company.”Mr. Lutz said that G.M. was still discovering ways to streamline and save money within its own operations, which he noted were much larger than those of Renault and Nissan. While he said the company was always looking for ways to improve its competitive situation, he was not sure the talks with Renault and Nissan would turn out to be productive.“We are for, absolutely, resolutely, whatever creates the greatest value for the General Motors shareholder,” Mr. Lutz said.He and Mr. Wagoner voiced irritation with Mr. Ghosn and other Renault executives who have discussed the negotiations publicly in interviews this week, noting the sides agreed to keep mum about the talks until they were completed.Mr. Wagoner said, “We’ll let those discussions go on behind closed doors.”'"
"'06-09-29,'0','SEATTLE, Sept. 28 (AP) —The Zune music player from Microsoft looks like an iPod, acts like an iPod and will cost about the same as an iPod. The company said Thursday that it would charge $249.99 for the device, signaling that it is not planning a price war to gain market share.“It’s not going to be price that really drives people to Zune,” said Michael Gartenberg, an analyst with Jupiter Research.Instead, the company is hoping to gain an edge by promoting two features that Apple Computer does not offer on its iPod: a subscription music service and the ability to share music with other Zune users through a wireless connection.Microsoft plans to start selling the portable music player and its companion online music service on Nov. 14 in the United States, just ahead of the holiday gift-buying rush.The service will let people buy songs individually for about 99 cents, the price Apple charges for songs from its popular iTunes Store.'"
"'06-09-29,'0','Yellow lentils, especially in southern Indian cuisine, are a staple, and often the main source of protein for the many Indian immigrants who are vegetarians.Many Indians typically eat lentils several times a day, using them for several components of a meal. Many entrees are served with a side dish called dal: lentils simmered with onion, garlic, ginger, turmeric, cumin, coriander and lemon.India, the world’s largest exporter of lentils, imposed the restrictions in late June because an especially bad crop resulting from extreme drought stoked fears of a shortage and sent domestic prices climbing.“Some people might say, ‘Big deal, it’s just a bean,’ but to Indians, the lentil is our bread,” said G. L. Soni, who owns House of Spices, an Indian food distributor in Corona, Queens. “Many Indians are vegetarians, so it is their bread and milk and cheese and meat combined.”“Some of my customers are getting panicky and wanted to stock up,” Mr. Soni continued. “They were demanding so many lentils that I had to start rationing. I said, ‘If I give you 20 barrels, I won’t have enough for anyone else.’ ”The price of yellow split peas, or toordall, which come under the lentil umbrella, has jumped to 85 cents per pound from 34 cents, and a pound of white lentils, or uradall, has risen to $1 from 65 cents, Mr. Soni said.He says he buys from some exporters in India who have found a way around the ban, and sells 25 shipping containers a month, each containing 22 tons of lentils, to restaurants and stores.Lotika Joshi sat at Dimple, her small vegetarian restaurant on 73rd Street in Jackson Heights, and lamented the lentil situation, explaining that she had decided not to pass the higher prices on to her customers.“It is affecting everyone around here because lentils are a very big part of the Indian meal,” she said, “I cannot run this place without Indian lentils. You have to cook lentils until they are soft and fluffy. With poorer lentils, some of them never soften. They stay hard.”Next door at the Dosa Diner, the manager, Rajesh Gopinath, said he, too, paid more to get Indian lentils“Look at my menu: 80 percent of it is made from lentils,” he said. He pointed out the mulligatawny lentil soup and the dosa pancakes made from rice and lentils. Lentils help make the uthappam, large round pancakes eaten with different toppings, the way pizza is. And there are various types of lentil patties like medhu vada and iddly cakes.Manjit Singh, manager of the Jackson Diner in Jackson Heights, said he was continuing to buy Indian lentils even though most of his customers probably would not be able to distinguish them from lentils produced elsewhere.Nirmal D’Costa, owner of the Delhi Palace on 74th Street, said he was forced to raise the prices on some of his lentil dishes.Last week, shoppers browsed the extensive lentil inventory of large South Asian markets like Subzi Mandi and Patel Brothers, and commiserated over the prices.“Some bags that used to cost $4 now cost $11, and people are still buying them,” said Rokeya Ahmed, a Bengali woman from Woodside who leaned against a pile of 40-pound sacks of lentils, the oil saturating the burlap. She said the lentil woes were the talk of the local Indian community and undoubtedly of the millions of Indian expatriates in the United States.But the shortage of lentils in Queens did not pose the danger it did in poor areas of India. “In India, people would be starving, with these prices,” Ms. Ahmed said. “Thankfully, we are a rich country here.”Umesh Mody, owner of Maya Overseas Food, a distributor in Maspeth, Queens, said he sold 1,200 tons of lentils a year and had been buying more from Australia, Canada, Mexico, Turkey and Thailand.“When people heard the ban was coming, they got scared and started hoarding it,” he said. “Instead of buying just 2 pounds, they were buying 15 pounds each. We were depleted.”Mr. Gopinath said suppliers were engaging in price manipulation by withholding lentils from the market to keep the prices high.“The middleman is getting rich,” he said. “They knew the ban was coming and they stocked up on lentils. Now they’re selling for a high price. They will never let it go back down. It is like gasoline. Once they see people will pay that much, why would they ever drop the price again?”Mr. Mody agreed, but said he and other distributors were also paying more. “It’s like the price of gas,” he said. “Whatever it goes up to, you have to pay it. What choice do you have?”Mr. Soni, standing in his warehouse nestled among the hundreds of auto shops and junkyards just east of Shea Stadium, agreed.“We not making money off this,” he said. “We’re in the same soup everyone else is.”'"

This woman already looked drawn from a diet consisting principally of Marlboro Lights, Diet Coke and various other, uh, substances. The woman took the hint. She took time off to “rest” and came back so thin you could drive a Hummer through the space between her thighs.“They pay lip service to the problem, and then they tell you to send only this type of girl,” said James Scully, a casting agent, referring to editors and designers. “It’s not going to change until the styles do.”To judge from the spring 2007 offerings, that won’t happen soon. One criticism being leveled at the clothes offered on the runways is that they are skewed too young. The most prevalent trend favors dresses suitable for either anorexic Lolitas or Mia Farrow circa “Rosemary’s Baby.” In either case, a pact with the devil is required.Trying to remain adolescent forever is doomed. It takes firm flesh and even firmer resolve for a woman to walk out of the house wearing a dress whose hemline barely grazes her buttocks. For those who would have to consult mom if asked to identify Monica Lewinsky, the current style setter is Lindsay Lohan. Ms. Lohan is barely 20; she dresses as if she’s 45.• “Shoes are like a throw pillow,” Tom Ford once said. “You’re going to buy your expensive sofa in a neutral color, and then throw a wild pillow on it.” Not coincidentally, shoes are the money spinners at Gucci, where Mr. Ford used to work. They outsell every other apparel item by miles. And the shoemaker who undoubtedly sells more shoes than anyone in this city of fashion commerce is Diego Della Valle, the owner of Tod’s, the leather goods colossus.Although hardly a word about it turned up in the fashion press, the Tod’s presentation on Thursday at a contemporary art gallery drew some 1,400 people. The installation — bags, hats, loafers, sneakers and a niche line of leather apparel designed for the house by Derek Lam — was titled “Dada,” for no very apparent reason.Pop would have been a more apposite reference, because Tod’s pebble-soled Gommino, a basic driving shoe based on the moccasin, is the footwear equivalent of an Andy Warhol. Arrayed in a grid along a gallery wall, the Gommino shoes, in bright colors and varying leathers, resembled one of the Pop artist’s famous multiples.Originally a summer shoe, the moccasins were for a time an emblem of Hollywood chic. Their appeal drooped for a while, as competing labels like Carshoe horned in on the market, and consumers decided that what looked cool on Elle Macpherson as she sprinted down 57th Street in skinny jeans and hauling a massive Birkin bag looked less cool when the orthodontist bought a similar pair he saw Kevin Costner wearing.Now — for reasons best known to the capricious sprites invoked when Heidi Klum says of fashion “One day you’re in, the next day you’re out” — Tod’s basic moccasins have developed the aura of a favorite piece of clothing you forgot you owned. This is not merely personal opinion. The Tod’s Group just released its earnings for the first half of 2006: $349.8 million, up more than 15 percent over the same period a year ago.“We’ve kind of run the gamut in the business of toes, heels, platforms, wedges, high, low, anything you can name and throw on a wall to see if it sticks,” Mr. Lam said at the Tod’s presentation. Unlike the cork-soled Frankenwedges seen on fashion-afflicted women clumping miserably around Milan, they are also “comfortable and wearable,” he added with little thought to how radical that idea seemed.'"
"'06-09-29,'0','No one has explained how it is different in ways that justify condoning torture, rewriting international law, discarding principles of due process and human decency, ceding judicial authority to the president, and putting our troops and reputation in further jeopardy.The president’s pre-election antiterrorism legislation will do these things. It is a measure of cravenness that members of both parties would vote for this bill for political expediency. Christopher J. Mugel“Rushing Off a Cliff” is off the mark. I say that those who try to tear down our rights do not deserve to have their rights protected by us.But you say otherwise — that we must use judicious restraint and care to fight an enemy who is willing to fight without restraint and to win at all cost.I don’t think we can win fighting that way. In trying to vigorously protect our enemy’s rights, we will surely lose ours. Bill DeckerWe have reached the point where we must demand that the president uphold the Constitution.In the past, when a politician rose to the highest office in the land, it was taken for granted that he would put the nation first. Unfortunately, this is no longer the case.Unless we act and demand that our elected representatives act in our behalf, we will have an executive with unlimited power. Bob GearyThe day the detainee bill is signed will be a day that will live in dishonor in our history. The practices that appalled us in the past when used by sleazy regimes will be incorporated into our legal heritage.If we do not reject the responsible party in power, we will indict ourselves as accomplices before decent world opinion.You say that the “Bush administration uses Republicans’ fear of losing their majority to push through ghastly ideas about antiterrorism that will make American troops less safe and do lasting damage to our 217-year-old nation of laws.” This is correct, but incomplete.This administration seeks to strike fear in the hearts of all Americans so it can maintain total control. It uses the issue of security to create insecurity, while Democrats remain silent.In 1933, Franklin D. Roosevelt said that “the only thing we have to fear is fear itself.” The contrast is striking with today, when we seem to fear everything and reward the political opportunists who thrive on it.'"
"'06-09-29,'0','No amount of inconvenience will deter a terrorist. Unless all carry-on luggage, checked bags and cargo are meticulously screened, airplanes will remain vulnerable to bombs.That isn’t to say we can’t improve airline security.Recent news that the Transportation Security Administration is adopting some of Israel’s passenger screening methods, observing and questioning those deemed suspicious, shows promise.Passengers and our government need to recognize that as long as we insist on flying cheaply, we will have to fly without perfect security.The obvious solution is to balance a reasonable risk with the economic and social realities of air travel, and then be honest about the risk. There are inherent risks in airline travel, as there are in any form of public transportation. John PattersonEven before the government eased the near total ban on liquids and gels on flights, an amateur could have gotten around the rules. Passengers were rarely patted down, so terrorists could have passed through security checkpoints with liquids hidden under their clothing.During two recent long flights of more than 14 hours under the strict rules, the skin on my hands literally started to bleed in the dry air of the airplane cabin. Some passengers need more liquids to fly comfortably than just the “ample beverages” you ask the airlines to supply.'"
"'06-09-29,'0','Chile Pepper Fiesta, tomorrow from noon to 6 p.m. at the Brooklyn Botanic Garden, 1000 Washington Avenue, Crown Heights, (718) 623-7200, bbg.org. Free with admission: $5; ages 65+ and students with ID, $3; under 16 and members, free.How is a piece of jazz like a chocolate chip cookie?Even the youngest music lovers should be able to answer this riddle if they hear the Andrew Rathbun Quartet in Brooklyn tomorrow. The group will perform the first concert of the season in a new children’s series called, not surprisingly, Chocolate Chip Chamber Music. The brainchild of Helen Richman, a flutist and Mr. Rathbun’s wife, the series was partly inspired by the couple’s own cookie lover, 2-year-old Drew.What concertgoers will discover is that jazz is flavorful, yes, and often hot, but the real reason it’s like a chocolate chip cookie is that you can vary the recipe, and the results will still be tasty. That’s the revelation that dawns on Baker Bobbie, the series’s somewhat flaky M.C.“The theme is how jazz involves improvising,” Ms. Richman said. “Bobbie realizes that it’s the same with her baking.”The concert, called “Kind of Two” — a riff on the Miles Davis album title “Kind of Blue” — will demonstrate this in numbers like Sonny Rollins’s “St. Thomas” and Duke Ellington’s “C Jam Blues.” And since preschoolers don’t like to sit still, they will participate in toe-tapping, scatting and movement games, sometimes with the help of older children who play parts in the show.“One child comes in on a stick horse, waving a red flag, and says, ‘Exciting news, Baker Bobbie, you’re just in time for a horse race,’ ” Ms. Richman said. “Kids saddle up their pretend horses, and as the band plays, they can gallop in place.” The music will be appropriately energetic: Miles Davis’s “Move.”At the end of the set children can meet the musicians and try the instruments. They will also be glad that the sweet treats aren’t just metaphorical: chocolate chip cookies are served at each concert.“Kind of Two,” tomorrow at 10 and 11:30 a.m. in the upper hall of the Old First Reformed Church, 126 Seventh Avenue, at Carroll Street, Park Slope, Brooklyn. Tickets: $5; under 1, free. Information: (718) 638-8300.A VISIT TO OLD NEW YORKIt’s not easy to give a tour of a place that no longer exists. But the Central Park Conservancy will do so tomorrow, using art, photographs and an indispensable element that seems to work magic: imagination.That will help park visitors envision Seneca Village, thought to be the first community of African-American property owners in Manhattan. Encompassing land from 81st to 89th Streets between Seventh and Eighth Avenues, the neighborhood was razed in 1856 when the state paid its residents compensation, evicting them to make way for Central Park. Its spirit will be evoked tomorrow on Seneca Village Day.A family tour at 11 a.m. (an adult tour follows at noon) will emphasize village life. “The real difference is that the family tour incorporates hands-on elements and games,” said Terri Carta, the conservancy’s program manager. Rachael Stephenson, the tour leader, will show photos of artifacts like pipe stems and china shards and artists’ renderings of buildings. She will also teach the children games of the 1800’s, like Fly Away Pigeon. “It’s kind of like Simon Says,” Ms. Carta said.Children can also play games and make yarn figures (a period pastime) at 12:30 and 2 p.m. on the Great Hill Children’s Glade. At 1 Christine Campbell will bring Seneca Village to life in another way, through stories of the people who lived there.Seneca Village Day, tomorrow from 11 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. Family tour meets at 11 a.m. at 85th Street and Central Park West.

"'06-09-29,'0','It is also as fresh and green as a leaf.“I love it,” Molly Aiken, 19, a sophomore at Ole Miss, said on Saturday under a tent, under the trees, a party roar rising and dissipating into the whisper of a warm, humid wind above. “There’s no place like it.”Ms. Aiken, who is from Chattanooga, Tenn., said of the University of Tennessee in Knoxville, “I went to U.T. this past weekend, for the U.T.-Florida game, and I was, like, this just doesn’t compare.”Ole Miss’s stadium accommodates 60,580 people, and devotees of the Grove argue that the Grove accommodates more. It is every kind of party you can describe, at once: cocktail party, dinner party, tailgate picnic party, fraternity and sorority rush, family reunion, political handgrab, gala and networking party-hearty — what might have inspired Willie Morris, one of Mississippi’s favorite sons, to declare Mississippi not a state, but a club.On Saturday, David G. Sansing, a professor emeritus at Ole Miss who has written a history of the university, stood at the top of the Grove, watching the party .“Your college days are the fondest years of your life, and those memories of those years grow rosier as time recedes,” he said. “When these alumni come back and walk through that grove, they’re not just walking over land — ground — they’re walking back through time.”That time has changed going forward. Ole Miss was not integrated until 1962. And though there were few black families partying in the Grove on Saturday, black players dominate the Rebels’ football team.The hand-slapping between the partyers and the players as they took the “Rebel walk” through the Grove to the stadium was hard and full of heart. A police motorcycle escort preceded them.THERE are seven home-game weekends at Ole Miss. And people in the Grove have how to have a good time down cold — they can stretch the party over three days, from Friday night into Sunday morning. It is pimento cheese sandwiches and silver trays, candelabra and fried chicken tenders, button-down shirts, rep ties and khaki shorts, pearls, expensive sunglasses and flip-flops in your purse for when your high heels become history.As Ms. Aiken explained, you show up in a new dress for each weekend, and you wear your hair curly if it’s going to rain. Rain, like the thunderstorm that cracked the sky open late on Saturday, only throws fuel on the fire. When a bolt of lightning touched down at the edge of the Grove, blasting the trees with thunder, the crowd went crazy with approval.The party is technically a picnic. Originally an informal tailgating get-together when most serious pregame socializing took place at Ole Miss’s fraternity and sorority houses, by the 50’s the Grove started to become its own pregame tradition.Cars have been kept out since a rainstorm in 1990 that reduced the Grove to a rutted swamp, and tents replaced them. With the tents began a dance of real estate that kicked off the rules and regulations, and like a ball in play, the interpretations of them, that characterizes the party in the Grove today.The Grove Society, an alumni organization, posts a strict schedule for the event, which dictates that set-up will start at Friday midnight.Last Friday, at 11 p.m., the 15 university police officers assigned to orchestrate the arrival of people, pickups and vans unloading equipment at the road next to the Grove watched a gang of 60 picnickers, restless for territory and armed with tent poles and folding tables and chairs, sprint into the dark woods and disappear like a band of merry men into Sherwood Forest. White tents popped up like mushrooms, and the party was on.“We’ve tried arresting the first two or three, and they still come out,” said Officer Adam Peacock, standing beside his patrol car, its blue light bubble revealing more and more tents with each sweep. “They start yelling at each other, and then they just rush. I mean, we could arrest all of them, but that’s not very right.”A woman in a black cocktail dress with a diamond buckle, Sheila Cowart, class of ’83, approached the car to ask advice on beating the rush.“I know y’all say midnight, but if you really try to go by the rules, you got 200 that are in front of you, and you’re kind of out of luck,” Ms. Cowart said to Officer Peacock, shifting from heel to heel.By midnight, most of the ground in the Grove was staked out by tents, circles of folding chairs and public squares of banquet tables. Christmas lights and camp lanterns were going up, satellite dishes pointed toward the stars, and a boom box broke the stillness with thick, lazy Southern rock and roll.A boy in white shorts and a polo shirt stepped out onto the Walk of Champions, the brick path where the Rebels would make their ceremonial march through the Grove on their way to the stadium the next day.“Are you READY?!” he called to the trees, prompting the Ole Miss cheer.“HELLLLL YES! DAAAAMN RIGHT!” the trees yelled back. “Hotty Toddy gosh almighty who in the hell are we? Flim flam bim bam, OLE MISS by damn! WUUUUUUUUUUUUU!”The Grove was now a tent city displaying the names of families, Mississippi towns and other states. “Good Times Here Are Not Forgotten,” read one tent.“Sometimes people encroach on your space, and you got to kind of help them get in their correct spot, if you know what I mean,” said Johnnie Wade, class of ’80, on Saturday at 10 a.m., with a grin as friendly as a fried egg. “Bunch of rookies. There’s a certain place you want to be so everybody’ll know where it is every year.”Mr. Wade’s daughter cooked breakfast in their tent, beneath what he called “our redneck chandelier” — an Ole Miss umbrella hung upside down and wired with lights.Many who attend the weekends, like Mr. Wade, hire students or local people to set up the tent, stake out their spots and store the setups between games.“The Walk of Champions is where the prime real estate is,” said Chip Trammell, a senior at Ole Miss, whose business, the Rebel Tent Company, typically makes $25,000 a game, charging $150 a tent. “We don’t guarantee it, but you will be within a 10-yard radius.”He worked from 3 p.m. Friday to 3 a.m. Saturday to secure 40 tents for 30 clients.By Saturday afternoon, people spilled everywhere, smoking, eating, talking, drinking. Red plastic cups bobbed in a sea of chest-high hands, cigarettes tucked between two fingers.“Whiskey Sprite,” said Fred Vann, a sophomore and a Phi Delt, of his cup. “Most of us get the Jim Beam plastic-bottle fifth.”He produced one, as did two of the four friends he was standing with. “If you drop it, it doesn’t break,” he said.Susan Ashley Richburg, a sophomore standing with a group of sorority friends, when asked what was in her cup, said, “Water — you want some?” The women exploded shouting.“I’m 20 and I’ll be 21 in September,” Ms. Richburg said. “WuuHUUU.”It is likely that Ms. Richburg will mark many events in her life under the same trees. The Grove is a grove of generations of Mississippi families who went to Ole Miss and who send their children there. Alumni and students, fathers and sons, old friends and new acquaintances, seemed inseparable last Saturday, as if they had walked out of the halls ringing the Grove and were meeting between classes, not between decades.THE confluence of a peaceful setting and the presence of the right people is not ignored.“It is a tremendous network, that works,” said Doug Hederman, class of ’93, whose family not only owns a commercial printing company but also dominated newspaper publishing in the state for over 50 years.“What you’ll find here on a regular basis is presidents, C.E.O.’s of Fortune 500 companies,” Mr. Hederman said. “It’s a great opportunity to meet somebody you’re not doing business with.“Plus you start thinking of the political influence here. Homecoming of last year, Senators Lott and Cochran were both here, and Governor Barbour. It’s pretty powerful.”It is the site of powerful history, too. When Ole Miss was integrated at gunpoint in 1962 by federal troops, the rioting, during which two people died, took its last stand in the Grove before leaving the campus for Oxford’s square. James Meredith, the African-American student whose admission precipitated the fighting, graduated in the Grove.On Sunday, a monument to the chapter of history opened by Mr. Meredith’s admission, with a bronze figure of him striding toward a small stone temple, will be dedicated. It is placed behind the Lyceum, the school’s oldest building, where bullet holes still mark the struggle in broken brick. A restoration in 2001 left them carefully in place.Professor Sansing, the historian, called the day being commemorated “the last echo of the last battle of the Civil War.”Down the hill from where he stood, the streets crowded as Ole Miss’s team made its march through the Grove.Five hours later, the Rebels were defeated by Wake Forest in a blinding rain that pushed a 5 p.m. kickoff back to 7 p.m.But the party in the Grove held its ground until midnight.'"

"'06-09-30,'0','WASHINGTON, Sept. 30 — The Mets invested $53 million in Pedro Martínez so he could return the franchise to respectability and lead it to a championship. Less than two years later, they do not know whether he can take them the rest of the way.In the latest twist to his injury-ravaged season, Martínez will undergo surgery this week to repair a torn rotator cuff in his right shoulder. He is expected to miss at least eight months, and General Manager Omar Minaya said he did not realistically anticipate Martínez returning until after the All-Star Game break next season, creating a huge void at the front of the Mets’ rotation.The Mets discovered the rotator cuff tear during a magnetic resonance imaging exam Thursday, the same day another M.R.I. exam revealed that he had torn a tendon in his left calf muscle that would keep him out for the playoffs. Before opting for surgery, Martínez wanted to weigh his options, consulting Dr. William Morgan, his former physician with the Red Sox. The second opinion confirmed that Martínez required surgery.Minaya said that the news surprised him and that there was no hint that Martínez had a severe shoulder problem until after his start Wednesday, when he allowed seven runs in two and two-thirds innings in a loss to Atlanta.“He felt something different in his shoulder the last game, and he felt pain all over his body,” Minaya said. “His body language told us that he was not there.”Within the last 12 months, Martínez has dealt with injuries to his toe, his hip, both calves and now his right shoulder. Asked if he thought the spate of injuries would compel Martinez to consider retirement, Minaya said, “Absolutely not.”'"
"'06-09-30,'0','RIO DE JANEIRO, Sept. 29 (AP) — A Brazilian jetliner with 155 people aboard was reported missing Friday over the Amazon jungle, aviation authorities said.Initially, officials said they believed the plane, Gol airlines Flight 1907, had collided with a smaller plane after leaving the city of Manaus in the remote southwestern region of Para State. News reports said the plane struck a Brazilian-made Legacy, a smaller executive jet.But authorities later said they were no longer certain the disappearance was caused by a collision with a private jet. A Legacy jet had made an emergency landing Friday afternoon, federal aviation authorities said, but it was unknown whether it was related to the disappearance of the Gol airplane, about 130 miles south of the city of Cachimbo, some 1,250 miles northwest of Rio de Janeiro.The Gol jetliner had been scheduled to make a stop in Brasília before heading to Antonio Tom Jobim International Airport in Rio. Manaus is a major river city in the heart of the Amazon rainforest some 1,700 miles northwest of Rio.José Carlos Pereira, the president of the Brazilian airport authority, said five air force planes were searching for the missing Boeing 737 in a densely forested region and would continue to search through the night.'"
"'06-09-30,'0','Mr. Daukoru has been in contact with other OPEC ministers to discuss falling oil prices, which briefly dropped below $60 a barrel in intraday trading for the first time in six months on Monday. But OPEC denied there had been a shift in policy.One delegate from a Persian Gulf country, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not entitled to talk about his country’s policy publicly, had a calmer view.“We are not currently concerned,” he said. “The prices are currently manageable and fair. We’re not overly alarmed by the prices. It’s the market working.”Demand for crude oil typically declines after Labor Day, and it is not unusual for oil prices to drop once the summer driving season is over. Consumption tends to pick up again with the first winter cold.“We are not going to push extra oil in the market or force it down our customers’ throats; we just respond to demand,” the delegate said.Still, despite assurances from Saudi Arabia and others that they would keep markets amply supplied with oil, the contradictory statements from senior OPEC representatives have raised doubts about the oil cartel’s strategy.Whether Nigeria and Venezuela actually reduce their output or not, the mixed messages have at least succeeded in one way: oil traders have been persuaded that OPEC will step in to defend prices, and, therefore, the recent price decline has slowed.OPEC’s acting secretary general, Mohammed Barkindo, who is also a senior Nigerian official, told the energy publication Platts that he had met with Saudi Arabia’s oil minister this week in Riyadh and that Saudi Arabia was already cutting its production as part of the informal agreement. Saudi Arabia has not commented on any change in policy.It will take a much larger drop in prices for OPEC to step in formally with a cartelwide production cut. Saudi Arabia, OPEC’s largest and most influential member, is apparently comfortable seeing crude oil fall to around $55 a barrel. Further declines, however, might provoke action by OPEC.“While apparently fanciful, reports of an imminent output cut reflect two hard facts: stocks are building faster than expected and several producers have an incredibly low pain threshold when it comes to price drops,” Antoine Halff, an energy analyst with Fimat, wrote in a note yesterday. “However, more price declines will likely be needed before OPEC producers decide on any coordinated move.”Venezuela, which pumps about 2.5 million barrels a day, said it would cut its daily output by 50,000 barrels, starting tomorrow. Nigeria said it would trim its exports by 5 percent at the same date, amounting to a reduction of about 120,000 barrels a day. Nigeria produces about 3.8 million barrels a day. It is notable that these two countries are taking the self-appointed role of managing the market since neither is currently meeting its OPEC production quota.Nigeria’s production, for example, is hundreds of thousands of barrels short of its peak because of social unrest in the Niger Delta, while Venezuela has experienced lower output for some time.“They are trying to influence the psychology of the market,” said Larry Goldstein, an oil analyst and the president of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation in New York. “Although they are reacting to the reduction in demand, they are trying to convince the market that they are actually anticipating it by making cuts ahead of the market. But they are simply reacting to it, which is how markets should operate.”'"
"'06-09-30,'0','Esperanza Spalding has the air of someone who knows she’s special. Why wouldn’t she? Almost every aspect of her biography is unusual. A 21-year-old who grew up in Portland, Ore., she is a bandleader in jazz, a bassist-bandleader, a bassist who sings, a bassist who sings with energy and optimism, a graduate of Berklee College of Music and already a faculty member there.Youth is also her liability, for now, as it is for almost anyone making this kind of art: it’s the cause of far too many notes, of pure, over-the-top, brash holding forth. But at her first show in New York, on Wednesday night, it was enough for the audience just to see radiance up close.That audience, at the Jazz Standard, also contained an unusually high number of jazz-business cognoscenti. Few outside of Berklee knew about Ms. Spalding a year ago. Recently she made a record for a small Spanish label, Ayva, with spotty distribution; first albums by young jazz musicians rarely do much anymore except serve as proof of vital signs. But that record, “Junjo,” got noticed.On Wednesday she brought two bands, her trio and her quintet. The trio is more original: with two Cuban musicians, the pianist Aruán Ortiz and the drummer Francisco Mela, she created an almost miniature group sound, anchored by bass ostinatos, that stayed fizzy, active and concise.Mr. Mela had a lot to do with it, rarely playing his bigger cymbals, but instead focusing a lot of action on smaller sounds: the stick on a clenched high-hat or a drum rim, a quiet, popping sound of a bass-drum kick. But Ms. Spalding’s high voice, scatting over grooves and singing along with bass melodies in her original songs, focused it all.There were loads of open space in the music. As Mr. Mela stayed away from long-decay cymbal sounds, Mr. Ortiz stayed away from the sustain pedal and ringing chords. This was light but rigorous stuff; there were solo sections, duets between voice and drums, bass and piano. Its only longueurs came from too much of a rather thin voice and her outpourings of soloing notes, gushers that didn’t necessarily serve the music and sometimes underscored the lack of strong melody.'"
"'06-09-30,'0','Drug companies have also been sharply criticized for failing to make public the results of some human trials of their drugs that suggest that the drugs are either ineffective or dangerous. Some lawmakers have proposed legislation that would require that nearly all human drug trials must be announced and their results disclosed publicly.A top F.D.A. official said the agency learned of the Trasylol study on Wednesday only after a getting a tip from a researcher involved in it. The official insisted on anonymity because of the sensitive nature of the information.In a written statement, Bayer said “that it mistakenly did not inform” the F.D.A. of the study and added, “This data was not shared immediately with the agency because it was preliminary in nature.”Staci Gouveia, a Bayer spokeswoman, said the company nonetheless stood behind the safety of Trasylol, which has become one of Bayer’s fastest sellers. Sales last year were $200 million and were expected to nearly triple this year.Several members of the advisory committee that met last week said they were shocked that Bayer failed to inform them of the study.“For them not to mention that it was under way, that it was being analyzed or that results were available is appalling and will do significant harm to their reputation for transparency,” said Dr. John Teerlink, an associate professor of medicine at the University of California, San Francisco, and a member of the advisory committee.Steven Findlay, a health care analyst at Consumers Union and another committee member, said the agency needed to investigate whether Bayer knowingly withheld the information from the advisory committee.“The safety of this drug is called into further question now,” Mr. Findlay said.Doctors give Trasylol to patients before surgery to reduce the risks of blood loss. It can also reduce the need for transfusions in patients undergoing heart bypass surgery. Trasylol, also known as aprotinin, has been on the market for 13 years.But two recent studies suggested that the drug might have serious risks. One of the articles, published in January in The New England Journal of Medicine, found that the drug increases the risks of kidney failure, heart attack and stroke. The study concluded that halting the drug’s use would prevent 10,000 to 11,000 cases of kidney failure a year and save more than $1 billion a year in dialysis costs, as well as nearly $250 million spent on the drug itself.There are other, cheaper drugs that can be used in Trasylol’s place.Still, the advisory panel concluded that Trasylol’s risks were worth taking in some patients. Dr. Teerlink said that despite the results of the new study, that might still be true.Bayer’s study was performed by a contract research organization. But Bayer did not inform the F.D.A. that the study was being done, even though that is routine practice.It examined hospital records of 67,000 patients, 30,000 of whom received Trasylol. The rest got other drugs. It concluded that the patients given Trasylol were at greater risk.Such studies, however, are fraught with statistical and other problems. Patients given Trasylol may have been sicker than those given other drugs. Their worse outcomes would be explained not by problems with Trasylol but by their own illness.Susan Bro, an F.D.A. spokeswoman, said it was evaluating the new study and would decide soon whether the results merit changing the agency’s advice about use of the drug.“It is regrettable that the F.D.A. advisory board did not have the benefit of a frank scientific dialogue based on the totality of available data,” she said.Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa and chairman of the Senate Finance Committee and a longtime critic of the F.D.A., said Bayer’s behavior proved that the agency was largely toothless.“The remedy is mandatory reporting of all clinical trials and real teeth for the F.D.A. to do its job in holding drug companies accountable,” Mr. Grassley said.'"
"'06-09-30,'0','William H. Gimson III, the agency’s chief operating officer, said in an interview yesterday that the finance office recently put in place the most complex financial management system in the federal government, and that some of the problems stemmed from carrying that out.“Good managers find problems and fix them,” Mr. Gimson said. “We are taking the report very seriously. In some areas we have lagged. We are taking steps to improve.”Much of the report describes a four-year overhaul that Deloitte proposed to oversee for $9 million. The centers have begun that transformation at meetings to ask employees to express their “challenges with and thoughts about” the services provided by the finance office, according to an e-mail message obtained by The New York Times from agency employees.The Deloitte report found that scientific managers in the agency were “hiring staff to fulfill financial management responsibilities due to dissatisfaction with” the finance office staff. It found that payment backlogs rose 47 percent from 2004 to 2005.“Managers are too removed from daily work and attend too many meetings; make decisions that should be made at lower levels, so people are constantly waiting on answers; people are unsure of which decisions they are allowed to make,” it said.Deloitte graded the finance office on five criteria. On “strategy” and “people,” it gave the office grades of 1 out of a possible 5. On “process” and “technology,” the office got 2’s. Only on “infrastructure” did the office merit a 4.Meanwhile, top management and finance officials at the disease centers have been rewarded with huge performance bonuses.Barbara W. Harris, the agency’s chief financial officer, got $84,894 in bonuses from 2002 to the first half of 2006. Ms. Harris’s bonus total was second to that of Mr. Gimson, who led the office through 2002 with $147,863 worth of premium bonuses — those greater than $2,500.John C. Tibbs, director of the finance office, got $52,880 in premium bonuses from 2002 to early 2006.Mr. Gimson defended the bonuses. “These are one-time recognitions, and I’m proud to have received” them, he said. “We are committed to rewarding the outstanding achievers at C.D.C.”Tom Skinner, a C.D.C. spokesman, said that Ms. Harris was not reachable and that Mr. Tibbs was not available for comment. John LaPlace, a spokesman for Deloitte, said he could not comment on the report for client confidentiality reasons.Since Dr. Julie L. Gerberding became director of the centers in 2002, finance and other management officials have received a growing share of the bonuses. The share of premium bonuses given to those within the director’s office has risen at least tenfold under Dr. Gerberding’s leadership, according to a New York Times analysis of the records.This resulted in part from a decision by the Bush administration to make a transformation of the management a priority, said Glen Nowak, the centers’ media relations chief.Deloitte spent six months this year interviewing more than 200 employees, according to a copy of the report obtained by The Times.The report is yet another indication of problems at the centers under the leadership of Dr. Gerberding. Soon after arriving, she started a reorganization of the agency that is now in its third year. In its wake, many of the agency’s senior scientists and leaders have left or have announced that they would leave.The Washington Post and The Journal-Constitution investigated the resulting turmoil, and they quoted disgruntled former senior scientists who said Dr. Gerberding’s leadership was creating a crisis.Five of the six former directors recently wrote to Dr. Gerberding expressing concerns over the exodus of key leaders and scientists, according to The Journal-Constitution.Dr. Gerberding was unavailable for comment, but in an e-mail message sent to the staff on Sept. 19 and reported by the Atlanta newspaper she defended her role and wrote that “press attacks” represented “symptoms of a disease within C.D.C.”“Frankly, I believe it is a chronic (or perhaps autoimmune) disease that pre-dates our leadership, but there is strong evidence of an acute exacerbation,” she wrote in the message, a copy of which was obtained by The Times. In autoimmune diseases, the body attacks itself.'"
"'06-09-30,'0','Amaranth Advisors, the $9.2 billion hedge fund that lost $6.5 billion in less than a month, is preparing to shut down.Nicholas Maounis, the founder of the hedge fund, sent a letter to investors last night informing them that the fund was suspending all redemptions for Sept. 30 and Oct. 31, to “enable the Amaranth funds to generate liquidity for investors in an orderly fashion, with the goal of maximizing the proceeds of asset dispositions.”Investors have met with Amaranth throughout the week, many demanding the return of their money. “As you know, the multistrategy funds have recently received substantial redemption requests,” Mr. Maounis said in the letter.The letter represents a turnabout for Mr. Maounis, who just a week ago expressed hope at the end of a conference call that he would be able to continue the fund’s operations. “We have every intention of continuing in business, generating for our investors the same consistently high risk-adjusted returns which have been our hallmark,” he said on Sept. 22.When investors are allowed to take money out of the fund, redemption fees and charges will be waived, the letter said. Cash distributions will be divvied up proportionately.The fund has lost $6.4 billion, according to the letter, which said assets were down 65 to 70 percent for the month and 55 to 60 percent for the year. Amaranth started the year with $7.5 billion and then soared to $9.2 billion before stumbling to less than $3 billion today.'"
"'06-09-30,'0','Three other class-action cases based on the same theory have been certified, but they are all in state courts and involve fewer smokers.Congress is considering two bills that would increase regulation of the tobacco industry. One would ban the use of the terms “light” and “low tar.” Another would give the Food and Drug Administration the authority to regulate tobacco.TURNING POINT For the first time in 11 years, monthly figures showed the median price of a previously owned home falling as inventories of unsold homes rose to levels not seen in more than a decade.The National Association of Realtors said that the median price in August fell to $225,000, down 1.7 percent from August 2005. That was the first time since April 1995 that the national median price was lower than the month a year before.Volume fell as well as prices. The number of existing-homes sold, which make up about 85 percent of all home sales, declined 0.5 percent in August from July. They had slumped in that month by 4.1 percent from June.At the same time, the Commerce Department said that sales of new homes rose 4.1 percent in August from July. But economists warned against reading too much into those figures because the government adjusted the July figure downward before making the comparison.The latest Commerce Department statistics on all construction spending will be released on Monday.SILVER LINING Falling gasoline prices sent consumers’ moods soaring in September, the Conference Board said. Its consumer confidence index rose to 104.5, from 100.2. in August. Analysts had expected the index to rise to 103.A steady job market helped brighten consumers’ moods. The Labor Department said the number of people making initial claims for unemployment benefits dropped by 6,000, to 316,000, last week. Still, the Conference Board said it found lingering concern about jobs and wages.The Labor Department will shine some light on the employment outlook on Friday, when it releases statistics on job creation, wages and the unemployment rate in September.LESS, BUT MORE The cost of employee health care coverage rose 7.7 percent this year, according to a survey sponsored by the Kaiser Family Foundation and the Health Research and Educational Trust.That is the lowest increase since 1999, but was still more than double the inflation rate and more than the increase in workers’ incomes. At the same time, people had to pay a greater share of the cost of their care: $2,973 annually for family coverage, on average, out of a total cost of $11,481.The government forecasts that 20 million to 30 million people will have high-deductible insurance policies tied to health savings accounts by 2010. About three million people had such plans last December.EXECUTIVES IN JAIL Andrew S. Fastow, who engineered the collapse of the Enron Corporation and then helped prosecutors convict other executives who helped facilitate the fraud, was sentenced to six years in federal prison.Mr. Fastow had agreed to serve 10 years in jail when he pleaded guilty in 2004 to two counts of conspiracy, but Judge Kenneth M. Hoyt of Federal District Court said he deserved less time behind bars because he had cooperated with prosecutors and with investors seeking to recoup some of the billions lost when Enron collapsed in scandal in 2001. Mr. Fastow, Enron’s former finance chief, has surrendered nearly $30 million in cash and property to compensate investors.Coincidentally, Bernard J. Ebbers, the former chief executive of WorldCom, surrendered at a federal prison in Louisiana to begin a 25-year sentence for his role in the $11 billion accounting fraud that toppled that company.Jeffrey K. Skilling, Enron’s former chief executive, is scheduled to be sentenced next month. He was convicted of fraud in May.EXECUTIVES QUIT As Hewlett-Packard’s former chairwoman, Patricia C. Dunn, prepared to testify before a Congressional committee investigating the company’s spying operation on its own directors, journalists and others, its general counsel, Ann O. Baskins, resigned.In quitting, Ms. Baskins joined a list of Hewlett-Packard officers who have left the company in the aftermath of the spying scandal. In addition to Ms. Dunn, who resigned last week, Anthony R. Gentilucci, H. P.’s manager of global investigations, and Kevin Hunsaker, director of ethics, have also stepped down.The company is waiting to see if prosecutors will file criminal charges in the case.

"'06-09-30,'0','Later in June, Goldman said it had rolled a third of its gasoline holdings into the reformulated contracts but would make further announcements as to whether the remainder would be rolled over. Then in August, the bank said it would not roll over any more positions into gasoline and would redistribute the weighting into other petroleum products.Goldman Sachs declined to comment. Some traders speculated that Goldman might have been concerned about the liquidity of the reformulated contract and whether other traders would embrace it because there were so few contracts outstanding. The open interest, or number of futures contracts taken out, has increased ninefold in the reformulated contract since then.Unleaded gasoline made up 8.72 percent of Goldman’s commodity index as of June 30, but it is just 2.3 percent now, representing a sell-off of more than $6 billion in futures contract weighting.Like many market indexes, trading in the Goldman Sachs Commodity Index is publicly available, allowing individual investors and third-party asset managers to participate in that market. The $100 billion invested comes from brokers, fund managers and individuals, probably including some of the same people who were hurt by high gasoline prices earlier in the year.Goldman’s announcement on Aug. 9 was not the only downward pressure on prices that week, market participants stress. And while it may have played a part in sending prices down, the market would never have continued its downward trend unless supplies had loosened up, they say.Also during that week, climatologists revised their hurricane forecasts, easing fears that oil supplies could be disrupted. And BP said it would still produce some oil from its field in Prudhoe Bay, Alaska, where leaks were being repaired. Meanwhile, the peak gasoline season was ending, and new supplies of ethanol were coming online.The week started with “everyone talking about $4 gasoline and ended with the market down sharply,” said Phil Verleger, an independent economist in Aspen, Colo.In following weeks, “traders all tried to push themselves through that door,” Mr. Goldstein added.“We saw gasoline fall 82 cents in the wholesale market over a four-week period, which is unprecedented,” he said. Mr. Goldstein said that the decline in gasoline prices helped send prices of the whole group of energy-related products down.Now, rather than highs, these products are hitting lows — natural gas, for example, traded on Wednesday at its lowest price in four years.'"
"'06-09-30,'0','David Brooks implies that Democrats are as culpable as Republicans for our intelligence failures and the fiasco that is Iraq.While President Clinton viewed terrorism as a grave threat, Republicans, drunk on their own power after the 2000 election, gave terrorism a low priority, preferring instead to focus on tax cuts.After 9/11, it was Democrats who argued that we should focus on Al Qaeda rather than expend resources and international goodwill to oust a dictator. It was only after Republicans fanned the flames of nationalism that Democratic lawmakers acquiesced to Republican demands.The lesson is not that both political parties failed but that a government ruled by a single political party blinds us at the very moment when clarity and transparency are most in need. Mark CassellDavid Brooks acknowledges that modern nations mark their greatness by economic wealth and that “Islamic extremists will continue to compete and grow until mainstream Islamic moderates can establish a more civilized set of criteria for prestige and greatness.”Why, then, does Mr. Brooks continue to support the violence of war as a means of ending the violence of terrorism? Given his reasoning, wouldn’t it be far wiser to divert the billions of dollars we are spending on the Iraqi disaster into the economic development of Palestine?Wouldn’t viable ports, secure water sources, healthy agribusiness and manufacturing plants be more productive in the fight against Islamic extremists than military action? Janet EllingsonDavid Brooks, by referring to the “Wilsonian madness of trying to introduce democracy into the Arab world,” muddies the water in two ways: he gives an unearned innocence to the neocons’ invasion of Iraq while doing a grave disservice to Woodrow Wilson.Wilson sought to create the League of Nations in order to promote democracy and world peace; the neocons show disdain for the United Nations and try to impose democracy at gunpoint, threatening world peace.Both projects may be naïve, but only one is Wilsonian. The other is indeed madness.'"
"'06-09-30,'0','THE Powder Ridge ski area in Middlefield, one of the state’s oldest ski slopes, has announced that it will not operate this season, because of financial problems.Ken Leavitt, who bought the ski area from the previous owners, the Zemel family, in 1997, said that he wanted to build a water park there and operate it year-round. He said, however, that a 10-year battle with the town to obtain the permit for the water park, begun before he took ownership, cost him $3 million in legal fees and studies and left him short of money. He received the permit in 2003, but did not build because he did not have enough funds.“Between the purchase price, the capital investment and the permit process, it left us in a position where we need more money to go forward,” he said.Mr. Leavitt said that he had been unable to make his mortgage payments and that the property was in foreclosure proceedings.Mr. Leavitt said that twice in the last few years, he reached an agreement with the Middlefield Board of Selectmen for the town to buy the land for $3.6 million and lease it back to him. But he said both deals were rejected by the town’s Board of Finance. Jon A. Brayshaw, Middlefield’s first selectman, said Tuesday that the town still wanted to buy the land and the business and would continue to try to work out a deal with Mr. Leavitt. He said the town would then ask companies to bid on managing the ski area.'"
"'06-09-30,'0','So Mr. Cohen popped up as well, loping around D.C. to promote his new movie, “Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan.” The satirist held a news conference in front of the Kazakh Embassy — as real officials inside fumed — to proclaim that any protestations that Kazakhstan treats women equally or tolerates all religions are “disgusting fabrications” by “evil nitwits” in rival Uzbekistan.Mr. Cohen is a genius at turning reality into farce, taking lowbrow humor to high places, but he has met his match in W.With the publication of parts of the classified intelligence report showing that the Bush administration has expanded the terrorist threat, as well as the books “State of Denial” by Bob Woodward, “Hubris” by Michael Isikoff and David Corn, and “Fiasco” by Thomas Ricks, all detailing the bumbling and infighting of Bush officials on Iraq, it’s a tossup as to where we can find the most ludicrous, offensive and juvenile behavior — in the new Borat movie or the Bush White House. Let’s compare and contrast:At a Southern society dinner, an etiquette coach teaches Borat how to excuse himself to go to the bathroom. But when he returns to the table with a toilet doggie bag, no one laughs.W. and Karl Rove “shared an array of fart jokes,” Mr. Woodward writes. A White House aide put a toy that made a flatulence sound under Karl’s chair for a morning meeting on July 7, 2005. When officials learned of the terrorist attacks in London that day, the prank was postponed. But several weeks later, “the device was placed under Rove’s chair and activated during the senior staff meeting. Everyone laughed.”Borat likes to wrestle guys naked. Karl liked to show W. his battery-powered “Redneck Horn,” blasting obscenities and insults like “Hey, hogneck, who taught you how to drive?” in a Southern drawl.Family values in Borat’s comic portrait of Kazakhstan are reflected by his sister, an incestuous hooker, the town rapist, a cow in the bedroom, and the annual Pamplona-like “Running of the Jew.”Mr. Woodward writes about Bush family values, or the “Running of the WASP.” Even though Poppy Bush found his old G.O.P. nemesis Donald Rumsfeld “arrogant, self-important, too sure of himself and Machiavellian,” the author notes, W. chose Rummy as defense chief, feeling “it was a chance to prove his father wrong.”Borat had a fantasy life in which he would bag — literally — Pamela Anderson and yoke her happily ever after to a plow on his farm. Dick Cheney had a fantasy life in which he would bag Saddam’s W.M.D. by occupying Iraq. In July 2003, Vice and Scooter Libby pored over fragments of intelligence intercepts, trying to figure out where on earth those elusive W.M.D. were. Mr. Woodward notes that Cheney staffers even called the chief weapon hunter with satellite coordinates for possible hidden caches.Borat thinks Pamela is silly to object to animal torture, just as Vice thinks the press is silly to object to prisoner torture.After much chaos, Borat gives up on Pamela and marries a prostitute. After much chaos, and even though Laura wants Rummy out, W. sticks with him at Vice’s insistence.No doubt. For lowbrow antics and silly stunts, W. is the clear winner. Respec’.'"
