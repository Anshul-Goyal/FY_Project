"'07-08-01,'1','Ralph Orssini, the president of Honora, acknowledged some initial concern about dunking his fine jewelry in yogurt for an ad. “At first I had to really be explained what the concept was,” he said, adding that he soon realized that the creative campaign could speak to a younger generation.He also said that he saw similarities between the products: Honora pearls have the highest nacre content of pearls on the market, Mr. Orssini said, “so in essence, we sell ridiculously thick cultured pearls, and they sell ridiculously thick cultured yogurt.”For Tourneau, the pairing seemed to underscore the sybaritic image that the brand tries to project, plus the physical qualities of the product. “In terms of luxury, the shape of the watch in the yogurt lends itself perfectly in ways a handbag or pair of shoes wouldn’t,” said Andrew Block, Tourneau’s executive vice president. “It’s all about making you stop to think,” he said, because “nobody has seen anything like this before.”Besides the print campaign — which began last month and will run through the end of the year — Ogilvy is also handing out samples of Fage Total this summer on the Hamptons Luxury Liner bus and two Hamptons Citarella stores, in conjunction with Hamptons Magazine, which also features the ads.Ogilvy is also hoping to sign up more partners for similar treatment with Fage, but it isn’t ready to announce any specific deals.Antonios Maridakis, the executive vice president of Fage USA, said that the dissonance of the images is what makes them so striking to readers. “They may go back and take a minute to put two and two together, and that is what makes it more impactful and memorable,” he said.Traditionally, yogurt marketing depicts the product as healthy, creamy and fruity, and usually features a fit young woman indulging in a spoonful or an energetic child grabbing a cup on the go. Luxury goods are conspicuously absent.“Tourneau and Honora are known for making premium, beautiful products, and we thought that combination would show people we see ourselves up there — upscale and high end,” Mr. Maridakis said.Since bringing its products to market in America in 2000, Fage, based in Greece, has cultivated a devoted following in urban markets, where Total yogurt is sold in high-end grocery stores like Whole Foods, Wild Oats and Trader Joe’s.While most yogurt sells for about 89 cents a cup, Fage Total is sold for as much as $2 more. But that seems to only add to its allure.“We saw it take off tremendously,” said Tim Sperry, a retail consultant for natural and organic food manufacturers and a former buyer for Whole Foods. He added that in terms of sales, Fage was one of the top 10 yogurts at the supermarket and remains a dominant player within the specialty foods channel. “They really paved the way for European-style yogurts to break out of the traditional yogurt category,” Mr. Sperry said.While major players like Dannon and Yoplait dominate the $3 billion yogurt industry, according to Nielsen Strategic Planner, denser, creamier Greek, French and other European-style yogurts are growing in popularity, according to Chris Crocker, a spokesman for the National Association for the Specialty Food Trade. And over the last year, yogurts with a “natural” claim on the package label grew more than 10 percent, selling more than $266 million, according to Nielsen.Fage manufactures its yogurt in Greece, importing it daily into the United States, but it plans to open a manufacturing plant in New York in 2008 because of growing consumer demand here, Mr. Maridakis said. While most yogurts use only one liter of milk, Fage Total yogurt uses about three liters, and employs a patented straining process to give it a dense, creamy texture, he said.Perhaps that is why the Ogilvy creative team chose to use the yogurt to produce the campaign’s images, rather than rendering them on a computer. “We knew we would get better realism and texture from pressing the jewelry into the actual product,” said Mr. Gigante of Ogilvy, adding, “but the Tourneau watch was not returned, let me tell you that much.”'"
"'07-08-01,'1','The stocks that helped push the market higher today tended to be those that have little exposure to the widening problems in the credit market. Technology stocks, including Apple, Cisco and Microsoft, were among the biggest gainers in the S.&P. 500. Telecommunications companies like AT&T also fared well.There was no clear trend through much of the day on Wall Street after a sharp fall in overseas stock markets. There were concerns in Asia that investors were being forced to sell Asian assets to cover losses in the United States, and that hard-pressed American homeowners would scale back their demand for Asian exports.The Nikkei 225 stock average, the benchmark for the Japanese market, fell by more than 2 percent, erasing the gains it had made so far this year. Widely watched indexes in Hong Kong and Australia fell by more than 3 percent each. South Korea’s key index slid by 4 percent.European stock markets followed the declines in Asia in their morning trading, and were generally down by 1 percent to 2 percent at midday there.The FTSE 100 index in Britain was off 1.2 percent, the DAX in Germany dropped 0.9 percent and the CAC 40 in France slid nearly 1.3 percent.Despite broad consensus that the outlook for Asian economic and corporate profit growth remains bright, global investors have been scaling back their holdings in Asia and other emerging markets recently.Analysts predict that markets there are likely to remain uncertain until a clearer picture emerges of how widespread the fallout will be from problems in the United States mortgage market.“The whole world is depending on investors in U.S. markets to get a little conviction that things are not that bad,” said Tim Condon, head of financial markets research at ING Financial Markets in Singapore. “The markets don’t care that the rest of the world is booming.”The latest retreat by global investors has been under way for two weeks now, according to data from Nomura Securities. After net buying of more than $27 billion in Asian equities this year, investors were net sellers by roughly $5 billion in the past fortnight.“Fund managers are having to raise cash levels against potential redemptions, and others are taking profits to shore up against losses in the credit markets,” said Sean Darby, head of regional strategy at Nomura International in Hong Kong.Analysts said the reaction in Asia raised important questions about the nature of Asia’s economic boom and the composition of its stock-market rallies.The knee-jerk response to signs of weakness in the United States housing market threw into sharper relief a growing debate among economists in Asia over whether the rise of China and India are ending the region’s lockstep economic reliance on the United States.“That is the thesis that will be tested in the next year or two, whether a slowdown in the U.S. can be offset by Asian consumer spending.” said Amar Gill, head of thematic research at CLSA Emerging Markets in Hong Kong.A report by the Asian Development Bank earlier this year appeared to throw cold water on hopes that Asia could stop worrying so much about the economic health of the United States and the world’s other major regional economies, the European Union and Japan.That report has buttressed economists who argue that rising intra-Asian trade, particularly with China, is largely based on the trade of goods and services that are ultimately destined for consumers in the United States.“This myth has been perpetuated that Asia has been decoupled, which is a truckload of baloney in my view,” said Venkatraman Anantha-Nageswaran, head of research at Bank Julius Baer in Singapore.'"

"'07-08-01,'1','Aurorita M. Mendoza, a former Nepal coordinator for Unaids, the United Nations AIDS agency, called the study “very important.”“It’s the first I know of that’s linked H.I.V. to sex-trafficked girls,” she said.Nepal — a poor, religiously conservative country in the Himalayas — has until recently had relatively few AIDS cases. The government estimates that it has only about 10,000. The official Unaids estimate is 75,000, but that may be too high, given that some previous estimates for other countries have been wrong. One month ago, for example, Unaids cut its official estimate for neighboring India by 56 percent, to about 2.5 million infected, more than anywhere except South Africa and Nigeria.The study, which was paid for by the State Department’s Office of Trafficking in Persons and by Harvard and Boston Universities, tested 287 girls and women being helped by a charity called Maiti Nepal, or Nepali Mother’s Home, in the capital, Katmandu. Most had been sent home by Indian anti-prostitution groups working with the police.Thirty-eight percent of the Nepali women tested by Dr. Silverman’s team were infected with H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS. But among the youngest — the 33 girls who had been sent into sex slavery before they were 15 years old — the infection rate was 61 percent.Brothel owners pay twice as much for young girls, Dr. Silverman said, and charge more for sex with them, sometimes presenting them as virgins, because men think young girls have fewer diseases or believe the myth — common in some countries — that sex with a virgin cures AIDS.“It’s absolutely heartbreaking,” Dr. Silverman said. “Some of them are just shells — and shells of very young human beings. It’s every father of a daughter’s worst nightmare.”About half of those tested had been lured to India by promises of jobs as maids or in restaurants. Some were invited on family visits or pilgrimages and then sold — sometimes by relatives. Some were falsely promised marriage. Some were simply drugged and kidnapped, often by older women offering a cup of tea or a soft drink in a public market or train station, Dr. Silverman said.Not all Nepali women are kidnapped or tricked, Miss Mendoza, the former Unaids official, noted; poverty drives some into the profession knowingly.“This heartless ‘trade’ has been popular for more than six decades in the subcontinent,” said Romesh Bhattacharji, a former national law enforcement official in India. “In some parts of northern Nepal, one can tell which house has a girl working in an Indian brothel by its roof. If it’s tin, that’s brothel money.”Miss Mendoza said returning girls may be rejected by their families and villages because of fear that they will either corrupt other girls or will so taint the village’s reputation that no one will marry its young women.As a result, these victims of kidnapping and rape may be forced to keep selling themselves. One survey of Katmandu prostitutes, Dr. Silverman said, found that half had worked in India. They may also become pregnant and, without treatment, infect their children.Working in a brothel in Mumbai — India’s financial capital and one of the world’s largest cities — was a risk factor in itself, the study found. The youngest also tended to have been in multiple brothels and in them for more than a year, raising their risk.India’s epidemic, concentrated among prostitutes, truckers, men who have sex with men and people who inject drugs, is most common in its industrialized south and in the heroin-smuggling areas near Pakistan and Myanmar, not in regions bordering Nepal.Worldwide, about 500,000 young women are trafficked each year, according to the State Department. Most of the 150,000 trafficked in southern Asia end up working as prostitutes in Indian cities, according to the United States Congressional Research Service. Rights agencies said a decade ago that up to 7,000 women from Nepal were trafficked to India each year; civil strife has presumably increased that number.'"
"'07-08-01,'1','“Sponsors have almost no choice in this case,” Frank Vuono, a partner in 16W Marketing, a sports marketing company, said. “In the endorsement world, a lot of times, perception is reality.”But the Vick reality is unlike that of any other misbehaving athlete, and that is the key. He is accused of sponsoring dogfighting and authorizing acts of cruelty against dogs, prompting anger from advocacy groups and pet lovers, and sparking protests at the Falcons’ training camp. More than 165,000 messages were sent to Nike through the Humane Society of the United States to persuade the shoe and apparel company to suspend Vick.Should it surprise anyone that dogfighting is the new taboo? Those who own pets spend billions of dollars on their care. They also give the USA network stellar ratings for the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show. Can anyone imagine abusing their pets, or those show dogs, for sport?“This is a first so it carries a lot of attention,” said David Carter, principal of the Sports Business Group, a sports marketing consulting company based in Los Angeles. “What gets lost in the concern about a rush to judgment is that while there may be legal concerns, marketing-wise, you have to shoot first and ask questions later. You have to build a moat around your brand.”The reaction to Vick’s dogfighting indictment stuns Don Yaeger, co-author of the book, “Pros and Cons: The Criminals Who Play in the N.F.L.”Much of the book focused on domestic abuse by players. “The N.F.L. might suspend them for a game or two, but they’re always welcomed back with open arms,” Yaeger said. “A lot of groups protest violence against women, but they didn’t gather outside camps when the players came back.”Athlete misbehavior informs company decisions. Kobe Bryant lost nearly all his sponsors (Nike put him in a deep freeze) well before the sexual assault charge against him was dropped because the accuser refused to testify. Three years later, he hasn’t recovered his near-Jordanesque marketing profile. His endorsement portfolio is “a fraction of what it should have been now,” Bob Williams, the president of Burns Sports and Entertainment, said.Ray Lewis was accused of murdering two men outside an Atlanta nightclub in 2000 but the Baltimore Ravens’ linebacker received the full support of then-owner Art Modell, who testified to his good character at his bail hearing. The murder charges against Lewis fell apart when witnesses could not tie him to the murder weapon, a knife, and he pleaded guilty to obstructing justice. Paul Tagliabue, then the commissioner, waited two months after the charges were dropped to fine him $250,000.Lewis had no major endorsements at the time, only a shoe deal and some local contracts. “He wasn’t the face of the league, the way Michael Vick is,” said Lewis’s agent, Roosevelt Barnes. But for a while, he noted, “Ray’s situation was more serious than Vick’s is; human lives were involved.”The next season, Lewis felt the lingering effect of the case; he was the M.V.P. of the Super Bowl, but didn’t get the traditional postgame Disney ad, and was not one of five Ravens on a Wheaties box. Still, he recovered nicely, getting EA Sports and Reebok deals and became a face of the league.Still, had the murder case never happened, Lewis’s marketing appeal would be much stronger. Williams said: “You’d be mentioning him in the same breath as Peyton Manning and Brett Favre.”If Vick manages to beat the charges against him, his marketing revival will rely on whether wary sponsors can forget the indictment’s grisly images of animal abuse. If they can’t, well, there will always be another quarterback.'"
"'07-08-01,'1','After the market closed, the investment bank Bear Stearns, which this summer had to shut down two hedge funds that had made bad bets in the subprime mortgage market, said that a third fund had suffered losses in July and that redemption requests had been suspended.Unlike the other two hedge funds, the Bear Stearns Asset-Backed Securities Fund, with $850 million in assets, had only a small fraction of its investments — less than 1 percent — in subprime mortgages, and the fund had not borrowed money to try to juice up returns, according to a person briefed on the fund but not authorized to speak for attribution.The fund’s managers did not want to sell securities in which the fund had invested, including prime and “Alt-A” mortgage securities, into the jittery market, the person said. Alt-A loans are made to borrowers with good credit scores but who were either engaged in speculating or had flaws in their credit histories.“There are no plans to shut down the fund,” a spokesman for the Bear Stearns, Russell Sherman, said. “We believe the fund portfolio is well-positioned to wait out the market uncertainty, and we believe by suspending redemptions we can ensure the best long-term results for our investors.”Shares of Bear Stearns fell nearly 4.8 percent in regular trading yesterday and dropped another 3 percent in after-hours trading. The financial sector led the market decline, falling by 1.8 percent for the day. Lehman Brothers was down 4.3 percent in regular trading, Goldman Sachs dropped 3.8 percent, and Merrill Lynch 3.3 percent.Treasury prices rose as investors sought safety. The price of the 10-year note increased 15/32, to 98 4/32 . The yield, which moves opposite price, fell to 4.74 percent, from 4.80 percent late Monday.The stock market is likely to remain volatile as problems pile up in the mortgage market. A steeper decline in home prices is exacerbating the problems. Just yesterday, an index that tracks home prices in 20 large metropolitan area showed that prices were 2.8 percent lower in May from a year ago, down from a 2.1 percent decline in April, according to Case-Shiller, a research firm.Though far from household names, American Home Mortgage and C-Bass, or Credit-Based Asset Servicing and Securitization, play a crucial role in the industry by making loans, collecting monthly payments from homeowners and trading mortgages and related securities with banks and investors.In the first six months of the year, A.H.M. was the nation’s 10th-largest mortgage lender with $34.6 billion in loans, according to Inside Mortgage Finance, a trade publication. C-Bass serviced $58 billion in mortgages at the end of June and had $6.6 billion in assets, down from $8.8 billion at the end of 2006.Both companies are suffering from problems related to tighter credit as Wall Street banks and brokerages increase margin demands and pull their lines of credit from these and other similar mortgage companies, effectively turning off the spigot of capital and liquidity.These actions, analysts warned, could cause the cost of loans to home borrowers to rise further.“It is effectively a run-on-the-bank scenario,” Thomas J. Abruzzo, a managing director at bond ratings firm Fitch Ratings, said, referring to C-Bass.Analysts say this wave of credit contraction for mortgage companies is even greater than what occurred in March when lenders like New Century Financial were forced into bankruptcy protection after its lenders declared it in default on its borrowings.“This is a lot worse, this is more broad based,” said Paul Miller Jr., an analyst at Friedman, Billings, Ramsey Group, the investment bank.Founded in 1996, New York-based C-Bass specializes in investing in distressed home mortgage loans. Also known as “scratch and dent” mortgages, these are loans that were either not documented properly or on which borrowers missed a payment but are now current.The company prided itself on the ability of its proprietary software to spot loans that held the promise of a return from those that were bound to fail.“They, I think, have always been considered one of the best houses in New York,” said Jeffrey Kirsch, president of American Residential Equities, which buys defaulted mortgages.But Mr. Kirsch said that his firm had recently noticed that C-Bass was not bidding on pools of loans that were coming on the market. “That usually means one of two things,” he said. “Either you are out of money or you have assets coming in from other sources.”In a statement yesterday, C-Bass said that at the beginning of the year that it had $302 million of liquidity but received and met $290 million in margin calls from its lenders in the first six months of 2007. The company received $260 million in additional margin calls in the first 24 days of July.“We believe that nothing justifies this substantial amount of margin calls received in such a short period of time, particularly as there has been no change in the underlying fundamentals of our portfolio,” the company said in its statement. Executives declined to comment further.Late Monday, the two mortgage insurers that each own 46 percent of C-Bass — the Radian Group and the Mortgage Guaranty Insurance Corporation, or M.G.I.C. — said that their combined stake of $1 billion in the company could be wiped out.The nation’s two largest credit-rating agencies added to the unease yesterday after Standard & Poor’s listed 10 collateralized debt obligations, or C.D.O.’s, for a potential downgrade. A C.D.O. is a bond equivalent of a mutual fund in that it holds dozens of securities that are backed by mortgages.Meanwhile, Moody’s Investors Service said that it expected more severe losses on Alt-A loans.Following are the results of the four-week bill auction:'"
"'07-08-01,'1','Admiral Mullen and General Cartwright were nevertheless careful not to stray too far from assessments about Iraq given by other top administration officials, saying they would await a September report from military and civilian officials in Iraq before they could decide on the future of the additional troops there.The officers said the American and Iraqi militaries had made gains against Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia, the homegrown Sunni Arab extremist group that American intelligence agencies have concluded is foreign-led. But General Cartwright said Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia seemed “to have an unlimited pool from which to draw from.”Admiral Mullen, who initially opposed the Bush administration’s “surge” plan but came to believe that it could work if accompanied by economic development and political reconciliation, was generally unsparing in his criticism of Iraqi politicians. It is imperative, he said, that American officials “bring as much pressure on them as we possibly can.”Neither Admiral Mullen nor General Cartwright faced particularly difficult questioning, partly because neither man has been central to the Pentagon’s decision making about the Iraq war. Both are expected to be swiftly confirmed by the Senate.Most of the session focused on the future of the Iraq war, a sign of just how much the administration’s once grand plans for the military have been altered by the past four years.After the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, top administration officials spoke of transforming the military to win quick military campaigns with relatively few combat troops, and become more adaptable to fight terrorist leaders like Osama bin Laden and netwroks like Al Qaeda. On Tuesday, Admiral Mullen made clear that he expected the military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan to impose a strain on the armed services for years to come.For instance, he said that even if the United States were to cut its force in Iraq by half next year, it would still be another three to four years before it would be possible to guarantee that troops could spend two years at home between combat tours, a deployment tempo that Admiral Mullen said was the goal.Both General Pace and his predecessor, Gen. Richard B. Myers, have drawn intense criticism from Congress for refusing for years to enlarge the military even as troops were sent to Iraq and Afghanistan on multiple combat tours, many of them seeing their tours of duty extended by months. The administration reversed course late last year and announced plans to expand the Army and Marine Corps.Under questioning, Admiral Mullen said that strains on the force could end up dictating military decisions about troop deployments in Iraq. He said that maintaining current troop levels in Iraq beyond next April would force planners to extend tours of duty beyond 15 months, a decision he said he opposed.Admiral Mullen was also questioned on a range of subjects beyond Iraq, and he warned that Iran was aggressively challenging the United States across the Middle East and that it had made a “strategic shift” to enter into an alliance in Afghanistan with the Taliban, the militant Sunni Muslim group that Shiite-dominated Iran has long regarded as a foe.Admiral Mullen said he was also concerned about the situation in Pakistan, including the speed with which Al Qaeda has built up a safe haven in the tribal areas near the Afghan border. He said it was a good sign that Pakistan’s president, Gen. Pervez Musharraf, had sent his military back to the tribal areas, but said he was unsure how effective they will be against entrenched Qaeda operatives.'"
"'07-08-01,'1','But Pacelle said his organization supported the government’s efforts. “It is lose-lose for the dogs,” he said. “They either die a gruesome death as a dogfighter in action, or they will be killed because they are not adoptable.”A spokeswoman at the United States attorney’s office in Richmond described the dogs as part of the investigation and would not discuss the government’s plans for them.Vick, 27, and three others — Tony Taylor, 34, of Hampton, Va.; Purnell A. Peace, 35, of Virginia Beach; and Quanis L. Phillips, 28, of Atlanta — pleaded not guilty last week to charges related to a dogfighting operation that the authorities said was called Bad Newz Kennels.On Monday, Taylor pleaded guilty and agreed to help prosecutors make their case. He signed a 13-page statement confirming much of what the government stated when it indicted the four men July 17. The 18-page indictment uses graphic detail in describing the animal cruelty the men are accused of. It states that during a search of Vick’s property in Surry County in April, 54 pit bulls were recovered, along with a so-called rape stand used to hold dogs for mating, and a treadmill modified for dogs.More charges are expected in the case, and a trial has been scheduled for November. Vick, the star quarterback of the Atlanta Falcons, has been suspended indefinitely by the National Football League.Tyrone W. Franklin, the county administrator for rural Surry County, had to sort out where the dogs were placed.Twelve of them went to the small Surry Animal Control Pound, which is less than 10 miles from Vick’s property, down a gravel road behind acres of trees. Franklin sought help from surrounding counties and shelters to take the other dogs.The commonwealth attorney for Surry County, Gerald G. Poindexter, initially took control of the animals and had them kept alive as part of a local investigation into the dogfighting. In June, the federal government served a warrant to the county to seize control of the dogs. Surry County taxpayers had been expected to pay up to $25,000 for the dogs’ care throughout the case, according to a report in May by The Virginian-Pilot in Norfolk, Va.Franklin said dogs normally remained in the county’s pound up to 14 days. “They are either adopted or euthanized by then,” he said.The dogs have remained in those locations while the local and federal investigations have continued. No one from the public is permitted to see them, said James Smith, the county’s animal control officer.On Tuesday, the dogs were yelping from within the pound while Smith sat in his truck with a shotgun next to him. He said he did not know what would become of the animals.“They are in good shape,” he said. “They are not violent to humans.”'"
"'07-08-01,'1','Because of his conversion, “He spoke candidly about his role as Pol Pot’s chief executioner,” said the photographer, Nic Dunlop, referring to the Khmer Rouge leader.“If he remains true to his words and talks as openly as he did then, he can potentially throw huge light on areas of darkness that have eluded scholars for decades,” said Mr. Dunlop, who wrote about Duch in “The Lost Executioner.” Duch could offer damaging testimony against other potential defendants, who have denied or minimized their roles in the Khmer Rouge rule.Nearly one-fourth of Cambodia’s population died under the Communist Khmer Rouge, which ruled Cambodia from 1975 to 1979. Many died of disease, overwork or starvation, or were killed outright.Many, notably in Tuol Sleng prison, were accused of being enemies of the revolution and forced through torture to confess to often fantastic crimes before execution. Researchers have found written orders by Duch regarding torture and killings.In a government interview in 1999, Duch called himself “an individual with gentle heart caring for justice,” according to a transcript quoted by The Associated Press.“I was under other people’s command, and I would have died if I disobeyed it,” the transcript reads. “I did it without any pleasure, and any fault should be blamed on the leadership, not me.”Pol Pot died in 1998 and other leaders have died without being tried. But some major figures live in Cambodia and are often mentioned as possible defendants.Among them are Nuon Chea, the movement’s chief ideologue; Khieu Samphan, former head of state; and Ieng Sary, former foreign minister. All were members of the Khmer Rouge central committee. All have denied responsibility for the crimes.“All the former Khmer Rouge have different stories,” Mr. Dunlop said. Most of the leaders shift responsibility or deny it, he said. “Duch potentially could change all of that and provide evidence and testimony that could indict a lot of people in the Khmer Rouge leadership.”In an interview in 1999 with Mr. Dunlop and Nate Thayer, a journalist for the Far Eastern Economic Review, Duch said that top leaders knew what was occurring in Tuol Sleng, and he named names.“The first was Pol Pot,” he said. “The second was Nuon Chea, the third Ta Mok,” the Khmer Rouge military leader who died last year. “Khieu Samphan knew of the killings, but less than the others.”'"
"'07-08-01,'1','The free-agent quarterback Daunte Culpepper signed a one-year contract with Oakland yesterday, giving the Raiders a backup plan for the top draft pick JaMarcus Russell.Culpepper, 30, worked out in the afternoon before a gathering of Raiders scouts and coaches. The workout was private and Culpepper left without speaking to reporters, but Coach Lane Kiffin announced the signing shortly after the Raiders completed practice.Culpepper began 2006 as Miami’s starter but had trouble with his mobility and was sacked 21 times in the first four games.

"'07-08-01,'1','SAN FRANCISCO, July 31 (Reuters) — Shares of Apple fell nearly 7 percent on Tuesday on rumors, including talk of production cuts in iPhones or iPods.But there was little consensus about whether there was any specific problem at the company, whose shares had risen nearly 60 percent since it announced the iPhone in early January.Analysts who cover the company and options markets said there was speculation Apple was cutting production of either the iPhone or its iPod media player.“There are occasional rumors on Apple, often unconfirmed,” said Shaw Wu, an analyst with American Technology Research. “A lot of them end up being wrong or short-term.”He noted Apple confirmed last week it expected to sell more than 700,000 iPhones in its current quarter and 10 million next year.“As I understand it, iPhone production actually has been going up, since they obviously are going to ship a lot more than what they did in the first two days,” Mr. Wu said.'"
"'07-08-01,'1','In the end, Cashman said, it was an easy decision not to trade for Gagné. The Rangers eventually came to realize that the Yankees would not trade Chamberlain or Phil Hughes, but they told the Yankees they could not trade Gagné without receiving Kennedy or Cabrera.Kennedy was the Yankees’ first-round draft pick in 2006 and has advanced to Class AAA Scranton from Class A Tampa. In three stops this season, he has an 11-2 record and a 1.76 earned run average. The Yankees did not want to part with him or Cabrera for Gagné, who will be a free agent this winter.“This guy is the best reliever, without a doubt, to get moved; it’s a huge get for Boston, I can’t deny that,” Cashman said. “But to pull somebody out of our everyday position-player side in New York, or somebody that’s going to go into our rotation next year, I couldn’t do that.”Chamberlain will come to New York today, but only to pick up a passport for Scranton’s coming trip to Ottawa. Torre said Chamberlain would definitely not be called up today, although his promotion could come soon.If he is anything like Hughes, who was throwing a no-hitter in the seventh inning at Texas when his hamstring popped May 1, the Yankees will be thrilled.“It’s always hard to try to foresee how big league hitters are going to react,” said Hughes, who had a bullpen session in New York yesterday. “But 98 miles an hour with a slider you never see, it’s going to be hard for anybody to hit. I don’t think he’ll be a permanent reliever, but he can definitely pitch in either role.”Ohlendorf, who was acquired from Arizona in the Randy Johnson trade, has also made the switch to relief at Scranton. His fastball reached 97 m.p.h. in his last game. Other Scranton pitchers, including Chris Britton and Jeff Karstens, could also help the Yankees this season.Proctor leads all major league relievers in innings pitched since the start of last season, with 156 2/3. There is concern that overuse may have damaged his arm, and the Yankees decided to get something for him while they still could. But Proctor never complained about his role.“I’m glad Joe put me in as many games as he did,” Proctor said. “That showed he had confidence in me. I have nothing but respect for Joe.”With Betemit on the team, the Yankees can occasionally use Alex Rodriguez or Derek Jeter as designated hitter. Betemit could also cushion the potential loss of Rodriguez to free agency, although he is certainly not of the same caliber. The Yankees plan to work out Betemit at first base, too; he has played there in winter ball.Betemit, 25, hit .231 with 10 homers and 26 runs batted in 84 games for the Dodgers this season. The Yankees tried to acquire him from Atlanta last July for Proctor, and a year later, they got him. Torre seemed to endorse the deal.“We feel he’s a fine young player, a switch-hitter who plays a lot of positions,” Torre said. “It just gives us a little more versatility, and we felt we can fill the pitching void from down below.”'"
"'07-08-01,'1','Global oil consumption, meanwhile, is expected to keep growing and reach 86 million barrels a day this year, 1.5 million barrels more than in 2006, according to the International Energy Agency, an adviser to industrialized countries.Within five years, the energy agency estimates demand reaching nearly 96 million barrels a day. In a recent report, it warned of a “supply crunch” if oil supplies fail to keep up with the pace of growth in demand.Traders so far seem to have shrugged off questions about the resilience of the American economy. Last week, the Commerce Department said that the economy expanded at an annual rate of 3.4 percent in the second quarter, faster than analysts had expected.“It’s a period of uncertainty,” said Antoine Halff, an energy analyst at Fimat. “There are mixed signals on the oil market as there are in the broader economy. You have signs that the economy is resilient, and at the same time there are concerns about inflation and about the stock markets.”“There has been a very strong shift in market sentiment; everyone is bullish now,” Mr. Halff said, referring to the oil market.A report by Deutsche Bank said yesterday that Chinese oil demand would rise strongly next year as the Beijing Olympic Games bolster the country’s economy. Chinese oil consumption, which last year was 7.16 million barrels a day, is expected to grow by an annual 6 percent over the next two years. By 2015, Deutsche Bank estimates China’s oil demand at 10 million barrels a day.The rising oil prices prompted a senior OPEC official to suggest earlier this week that the oil cartel might act before its next scheduled meeting if prices reached $80 a barrel. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, which controls about 40 percent of global oil exports, next meets in Vienna on Sept. 11.But OPEC’s members appear divided over what to do next. The group’s most hawkish members, like Iran and Venezuela, oppose increasing output. Iran’s oil minister, Kazem Vaziri-Hamaneh, said on Sunday that he did not expect OPEC to consider changes to its output at its next meeting.But Abdalla Salem el-Badri, OPEC’s secretary general, suggested on Monday that OPEC could release some of its spare capacity to drive down prices.“A price above $80 also wouldn’t make us particularly pleased,” Mr. Badri said in an interview on Monday in the Austrian financial daily Wirtschaftsblatt. “We’re constantly monitoring the market and are therefore ready to adjust production if circumstances warrant this.”Thanks to last year’s high prices, OPEC’s 12 members enjoyed a 22 percent jump in their petroleum exports, to $649.5 billion in 2006 compared with those in the previous year, according to the organization’s annual report, released yesterday. The group’s total oil production, including that of the latest member Angola, was relatively flat at 32 million barrels of oil a day last year, up a mere 280,000 barrels a day from the previous year.But few analysts think that the oil-producing cartel has much capacity to act. The International Energy Agency estimates that OPEC’s sustainable spare capacity is 2.8 million barrels a day, much of it in Saudi Arabia.Even at today’s levels, oil futures are still about $10 a barrel short of the all-time inflation-adjusted peak set in 1981. Oil prices would have to rise to about $90 a barrel to exceed that record.But that prospect does not seem so distant — or inconceivable — anymore.Goldman Sachs analysts warned in a recent report that without swift action from Saudi Arabia, oil prices could rise above $90 a barrel this fall. They said that an increase in OPEC production could help push prices down by $5 to $10 a barrel.Some analysts said they were surprised by the market’s rapid gains this year.“This uptrend that has been in place since 1998 has not ended yet,” said Tom Bentz, a senior energy analyst at BNP Paribas. “It’s been nearly 10 years now in this bull market and we still have to see higher prices.”'"
"'07-08-01,'1','With generic competition looming for two of its blockbuster drugs and use declining for its drug-coated stents, Johnson & Johnson said yesterday that it would eliminate up to 4,800 jobs.The cuts would amount to 3 to 4 percent of the company’s global work force of 120,000 people, with the pharmaceutical and stent divisions hardest hit by staff reductions. The company declined yesterday to say exactly where the cuts would take place, other than to say that it would close a Mountain View, Calif., operation and eliminate the jobs of 600 of the people who work there. An additional 200 people there will be relocated.Johnson & Johnson, based in New Brunswick, N.J., said the job cuts and other streamlining efforts would save $1.3 billion to $1.6 billion a year. That will probably not be enough, though, to offset revenue losses from the expiration of patents on two important drugs over the next two years. Generally, when patents expire, brand companies quickly lose the bulk of their sales to generic competition.The company’s top-selling drug, Risperdal, an oral treatment for schizophrenia and other mental conditions, is expected to lose patent protection next year. Sales last year for the oral Risperdal were $3.3 billion.Topamax, a pill for epilepsy and migraine headaches, which had sales of $2 billion last year, is also expected to lose patent protection in 2008. But an application for pediatric use could extend the protection until 2009.'"
"'07-08-01,'1','A federal bankruptcy judge has awarded rights to the reviled O. J. Simpson book “If I Did It,” a hypothetical account of how he could have killed his former wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, to the family of Ronald Goldman, right, her friend who was murdered with her in a 1994 knife attack, The Associated Press reported. “After 13 years of trying to get some justice, today is probably the first time we had any sense of seeing light at the end of the tunnel,” said Mr. Goldman’s father, Fred. Mr. Simpson was acquitted of murder in 1995 but lost wrongful-death civil lawsuits to the Goldman and Brown families, who are seeking to satisfy their multimillion-dollar judgments against him. He has maintained his innocence. Under the settlement with a court-appointed trustee, which was approved by the judge, A. Jay Cristol, in Miami, the Brown family is to receive part of the first 10 percent of gross proceeds from the book and the Goldmans the rest. Publication of the book by HarperCollins was canceled amid public outcry.

"'07-08-02,'1','Shared storage can also make life easier for homes with both PCs and Macs because, in most cases, the drive can be accessed from either platform. Most shared storage systems come with software to automatically back up computers connected to the network. Some even allow access to the data from locations far from the home via the Internet.The hardest part may be figuring out which drives on the store shelves are network-attached storage drives. Many such products use the word “shared” to differentiate themselves, but otherwise the box should say “network-attached storage” or “N.A.S.” Another tip-off: A network-attached storage device uses an Ethernet cable, not U.S.B., though it may also have a U.S.B. port for connecting additional drives or printers.In theory, adding a network storage device should be easy. The Windows and Mac sections of the start-up guide for the Maxtor Shared Storage II, for example, are each only two pages long. Simply plug in the power, use the supplied Ethernet cable to connect the drive to the router and run the install CD on one of the networked computers. Prices range from $200 for a 320 gigabyte version to $500 for a terabyte (1,000 gigabytes) of storage.But it’s not always all that easy. Although installation was pretty effortless on a Windows XP machine and on a Mac running OS X, it initially did not work with Windows Vista. It required finding and following complex instructions on a Maxtor product support Web site.The Maxtor drive also has two U.S.B. ports that can be used to add additional external drives or to connect a printer that can be accessed by any machine on the network. Finally, the drive can stream video or music files stored on it to a home entertainment device like the Xbox 360 that is compliant with the Universal Plug and Play AV or Digital Living Network Alliance protocols.What if you want the data when you are at the office or on the road? Western Digital’s MyBook World Edition hard drives not only plug into a home network but also can be accessed remotely at no additional charge. The software, which works only with Windows XP (a Vista version is expected soon) allows you to see files on the drive through Windows Explorer or use any program’s “open” or “save as” commands to get to the hard drives.For $49.95 a year, you can get additional services that give you access to files on all Windows PCs on your home network from any Windows machine connected to the Internet. MyBook World Edition network drives start at $250 for the 500 gigabyte version and continue up to the recently released 2 terabyte model, at $800.Like the Maxtor model, this drive has a U.S.B. you can use to plug in an additional external device. Network-attached drives cost more than regular external drives. Western Digital’s shared 500 gigabyte MyBook World Edition drive costs only $20 more than its 500 gigabyte counterpart that has no network accessibility. With Maxtor, the price difference is higher, about $100.For those willing to buy and install their own internal hard drives, which cost less than external drives, the $130 Linksys NAS200 Network System offers a great deal of flexibility. The device doesn’t come with any hard drives, but it has bays for two internal SATA 3.5-inch drives, the type used in most desktop PCs.If that’s not enough, there are two U.S.B. ports for external drives. The two internal drives can be configured as one virtual drive or, to provide extra backup, as a redundant array of independent drives, known as RAID. Drives can be accessed locally or remotely through a Web interface.With 500 gigabyte internal drives available for about $130, this do-it-yourself solution works out to roughly the same price as devices with drives. The advantage is that as the price of higher-capacity drives drops and the amount of data you are storing grows, you can upgrade later by swapping out drives.There is yet another flexible variation of network-attached storage devices, although it is a bit more expensive. Linksys and Apple offer wireless routers with a U.S.B. port to accommodate an external drive. With the Linksys WRT350N Wireless-N Gigabit Router with Storage Link ($160), you can plug in a regular external hard drive that can then be seen by any computer on the network. It’s also a very fast router, using the latest standard for wireless transmission, 802.11n.Apple’s AirPort Extreme Base Station ($180), which works with Macs and Windows PCs, also uses the 802.11n standard, but its three wired Ethernet ports work at the slower 100 megabit speed.These routers also work with the new Drobo “storage robot” from Data Robotics, according to Dan Stevenson, president of Data Robotics. The $500 enclosure holds up to four internal drives that you buy separately. It automatically mirrors data between drives for backup in case one drive fails.Sometimes keeping things simple is the best strategy. If you have just an occasional need to move files between computers, you can make do with a stand-alone external U.S.B. hard drive. (Some are small and sleek, so you can easily move them from one machine to another as you would a flash drive. It’s what techies call sneakernet.)But if you want the flexibility of an always-on drive that can back up your files and be accessed from any of your machines, a network drive is the way to go. With either system, though, consider backing up valuable and irreplaceable files off-site with an online storage service or on CDs or DVDs.'"
"'07-08-02,'1','Most cable companies offer high-definition digital TV recorders for a low monthly price, but many people find these devices lacking in features and difficult to program. The new TiVo HD recorder is aimed squarely at that market, offering 20 hours of HD storage (or 180 hours of standard TV), an easy-to-use interface and the ability to record two channels at once.Last fall TiVo released its first high-definition recorder, but it sold for $799 — and that was before the TiVo service fees of $12.95 to $16.95 a month, depending on the contract. The new $299 TiVo HD, which will be in stores this month, has a simpler design and slightly smaller storage capacity but retains nearly all the features.TiVo HD works with most major cable systems because of CableCard technology and will record premium channels. You will no longer need the cable company’s set-top box, but you are likely to lose access to video-on-demand and pay-per-view services.When connected to your home network, TiVo HD offers movie downloads from Amazon.com’s Unbox. You can also schedule recordings remotely using TiVo’s Web site.'"
"'07-08-02,'1','WASHINGTON, Aug. 1 (AP) — Federal customs agents raided more than 30 businesses and homes in 16 states Wednesday, looking for devices that allow pirated video games to play on Wiis, PlayStation 2s and Xboxes.Allegations about the sale and distribution of illegal modification chips and copyright circumvention devices for the popular consoles and others included 32 search warrants in 16 states, said the federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement.The agency declined to release the names of those raided but contended they were responsible for importing, installing, selling and distributing foreign-made devices smuggled into the United States.Illegal chips and other devices used on gaming consoles violate the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998. Sales of counterfeit or illegally obtained games costs the industry about $3 billion a year globally, not including Internet piracy, the Entertainment Software Association, a trade group, estimates.Piracy losses for Nintendo and its game developers and publishers may have totaled $762 million last year alone, said Jodi Daugherty, senior director of antipiracy at Nintendo America, based in Redmond, Wash.Ms. Daugherty’s five-person team coordinates global antipiracy efforts for Nintendo’s Japanese parent company. Since April, the company has helped law enforcement agencies worldwide seize 61,000 counterfeit Wii modification chips, she said.Wednesday’s federal raids came after a yearlong investigation, coordinated with the United States attorney’s office for the Northern District of Ohio and the Justice Department’s Computer Crimes and Intellectual Property Section.'"
"'07-08-02,'1','The diner, built in 1933, is the oldest in New York City, according to Michael Perlman, who led the campaign to save it. It has an arched barrel ceiling, the original stools and countertop, and wrap-around windows, he said, which are all distinctive of a railway-car style diner.Mr. Perlman helped locate a nonprofit group in Providence, R.I., called the American Diner Museum, which relocates diners facing demolition. The museum advertised the diner on its Web site.“Freestanding diners were manufactured to move, so this is ideal,” said Mr. Perlman, who became involved in the project after he learned in February that it would be closed this summer.The Moondance is set to be lifted onto a flatbed truck next week and driven to the oilfields of southwestern Wyoming.The move is the most difficult part of the project, which was reported by The Star-Tribune of Casper, Wyo., on Tuesday. Mr. Pierce and his father-in-law are truck drivers, Ms. Pierce said, but they have never driven a flatbed truck with a diner onboard before.Ms. Pierce and her husband saw an untapped market, just waiting to be fed, in the small town. It was even smaller, but then there was a recent influx of oil workers, who live in temporary barracks-style housing known locally as “mancamps.” The town does have three bars and one restaurant, called the Hideaway Cafe, that was supposed to open this week but had to delay its opening.The Pierces saw the diner on the museum’s Web site and decided they had found just the thing.“We were toying around with the idea, and said, ‘Wow, it would be nice to have a place in La Barge,’ ” she said. “This is in New York, but it sure is a nice-looking diner.”The menu might have to change, she added, in order to suit the tastes of the local population.“We would love for people to be able to catch their fish and bring it in,” Ms. Pierce said. “Possibly down the road, we might be looking at a buffalo burger.”'"

"'07-08-02,'1','“We are at war,” one of Mr. Mugabe’s vice presidents, Joseph Msika, said in a speech on July 18. “We will not allow shelves to be empty.”Zimbabwe’s economy has been shrinking since 2000, buffeted by political turmoil, capital flight and mismanagement, but never has it been in a more dire state than now, business executives say.“The last seven years, I haven’t panicked at all,” said one Bulawayo clothing manufacturer who, like most people, spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation by the government. “Now,” he added, “I’m not so sure. I think there’s a real collapse coming.”Zimbabwe’s vast underclass, the majority of its 10 or 11 million people, has long been unable to afford most food, so the rural poor survive on whatever they can grow. Urban and rural poor alike stay afloat with food and money sent by the two million or more Zimbabweans who have fled abroad. Remittances are so vital that in some rural areas, South Africa’s rand has replaced Zimbabwe’s essentially worthless dollar as the currency of choice.But with stores barren, it is the middle class, which had muddled through the last seven years of decline, that is likely to feel the brunt. People are now living off the food they had the foresight or ability to squirrel away in pantries. Otherwise, when gas is available, they drive across the border to Zambia, South Africa and Botswana for supplies. Factory layoffs and slowdowns are bringing new poverty to the 15 or 20 percent of adult Zimbabweans who still have jobs. Pensioners, whose fixed incomes already have been gutted by hyperinflation, now find that no amount of money can purchase some staples.Private doctors say that diseases of poverty, including tuberculosis and malnutrition, are starting to appear among their patients, including the minority whites who once were part of the wealthy class.“Considerations of color have begun to blur very much,” said one Bulawayo doctor whose average client is a white business manager. “White people will tell you, a little embarrassed and shy, that they’re eating nothing but sadza,” or cornmeal porridge, the doctor said. “They’ve been reduced to the diet of the rural poor.”[The rural poor suffer, too: the World Food Program issued an urgent appeal Wednesday for $118 million in donations to feed Zimbabweans, stating that drought and political upheaval would empty the organization’s stockpiles by year’s end without more money. The organization now feeds about 300,000 Zimbabweans and has regularly given food to as many as four million citizens at the height of the hunger season, in January.]Mr. Mugabe has cast the price cuts as a strike not against hyperinflation, but against profiteering businesses that he says are part of a Western conspiracy to reimpose colonial rule. In that view, price rollbacks are the government’s countermeasure.His June 26 decree, much of which was later enacted into law, was draconian: businesses were ordered to reduce their prices by about 50 percent. Shop owners who refused to comply would be jailed. Stores that closed or refused to restock goods would be taken over by the government.In recent weeks, gangs of price inspectors have patrolled shops and factories, imposing price reductions, sometimes arbitrarily. As many as 4,000 businesspeople have been arrested, fined or jailed, according to the Zimbabwean police.The government took over the nation’s slaughterhouses in early July after meat disappeared, and state-run newspapers publish lists of telephone numbers on their front pages daily, exhorting citizens to report merchants whose prices exceed the dictates.Ordinary citizens initially greeted the price cuts with a euphoric — and short-lived — shopping spree, since they had been unable to buy even basic necessities because of hyperinflation. Yet merchants and the government’s many critics say that much of the cut-rate merchandise has not been snapped up by ordinary citizens, but by the police, soldiers and members of Mr. Mugabe’s governing party who have been tipped off to the price inspectors’ rounds.In Plumtree, near Zimbabwe’s border with Botswana, a line of shoppers gathered outside a shoe store last week even before opening hours, said Moses Mzila, who represents the area in Parliament. As the store opened, government inspectors appeared — and the throng followed them in, buying up stock as it was marked down.“It’s theft, outright theft,” Mr. Mzila said. “Some of them had big cars, shiny, sparkling double-cabs, and they filled them up with shoes and just drove away.”Bulawayo, whose 700,000 or more people make it Zimbabwe’s second largest city, painfully reflects the impact both of Zimbabwe’s long economic descent and of the latest price-slashing. Most of the goods on store shelves this week were those people did not need or could not afford — dog biscuits; ketchup; toilet paper, which has become a luxury here; gin; cookies.At various locations of TM, a major supermarket chain, aisles of meat coolers were empty save a few plastic bags of scrap meat for dogs. Flour, sugar, cooking oil, cornmeal and other basics were not to be found. A long line hugged the rear of one store, waiting for a delivery of the few loaves of bread that a baker provided to stay in compliance with the price directive.The government’s takeover of slaughterhouses seems ineffectual: this week, butchers killed and dressed 32 cows for the entire city. Farmers are unwilling to sell their cows at a loss.The empty grocery shelves may be the starkest sign of penury, but there are others equally worrisome. Doctors say that at most, there is a six-week supply of insulin and blood-pressure medications. Less vital drugs like aspirin are rarities.“You can boil willow bark, just as Galen did,” one physician quipped.At one of Bulawayo’s public hospitals, an accident victim underwent successful surgery this week only to die of dehydration because there was not enough saline solution, one witness said. Nor was that unusual: one physician said that more than two dozen of his patients had died needlessly this year — nearly one a week — for lack of basic equipment, electricity, water or proper care. Most of Zimbabwe’s medical practitioners have long fled the country.“There are no IV fluids to speak of; no sticks to check for diabetes, no opioid analgesics,” the physician said. “And this is the situation at a relatively well-stocked urban hospital. In district hospitals, they don’t even have dressings” for wounds.Bulawayo’s clothing industry, the city’s largest source of jobs, has absorbed a direct hit from the price slashing, and the effects are echoing across the nation.When Mr. Mugabe’s price rollback was decreed in late June, shoppers stripped stores of apparel, saddling merchants with huge losses. Merchants who had not paid clothing manufacturers reneged on their bills; those who had outstanding orders canceled them. That left clothing manufacturers with blank order sheets and an idle work force whose union contract already provided for huge raises in July.A Bulawayo manufacturer who once employed 140 workers had already cut his payroll to 70 as Zimbabwe’s economy sank. When price inspectors descended on his factory last month, he said, they tried to confiscate bags of cornmeal used to feed workers in the company cafeteria.The price cuts, he said, have forced him to put his employees on a three-day workweek — “survival mode,” he called it — in the hope that orders will pick up. But that is problematic. Workers’ reduced salaries barely pay for their transportation to the factory, he said, and he expects that many will soon quit.Moreover, the manufacturer said, suppliers of fabric have also been ordered to cut their prices, even as inflation and problems like power failures have raised their costs. Once their existing stock of fabric is exhausted, he said, there is little incentive for them to make more.The manufacturer estimated that he could stay in business for another month by selling his goods at a loss. After that, he said, “I guess the banks become the owner of a lot of sewing machines.”His increasingly desperate employees are another matter. This week, he said, his well-paid receptionist came meekly to his office. She asked permission to take some mealie meal — cornmeal — from the stocks in the company cafeteria.“What do you expect me to do?” he replied. “I can’t get mealie meal any more than you.”'"
"'07-08-02,'1','The companies’ four principal employees were charged last month with embezzlement and money laundering. They were released yesterday on bail, set at $20 million apiece for Leonard Baldari Jr., Mystic’s founder, and Tonino Solimine of T & S, and $10 million apiece for their associates, Michael David Hiller, with Mystic, and Eston Clare, with T & S.. All four pleaded not guilty on July 18. If convicted of all charges, they could face up to 30 years in prison.While the phenomenon of “skimming” is not a new one, the scope of the charges has shocked many in the heating-oil business. Nicholas Panebianco of Panco Petroleum Products, which used Mystic to deliver oil to its customers, said that inspections are routine and that the company was well respected.“That length of time, that many trucks, it’s impossible,” Mr. Panebianco said. “Nobody’s that good. You’re talking about a guy who ran through a hurricane, ran through the raindrops, and didn’t get wet.”The investigation was conducted by the Internal Revenue Service’s criminal investigation division and the F.B.I., and the case will be prosecuted by Roslynn R. Mauskopf, the United States attorney in Brooklyn.The evidence in the case includes recordings made over 14 months of company officials selling stolen oil and seven years of financial records, said Burton Ryan, an assistant United States attorney, during court proceedings yesterday.The recordings show company officials reselling diverted oil for a 33 percent discount, according to F.B.I. documents.At Mr. Solimine’s bail hearing, Mr. Ryan described a dramatic arrest scene. Mr. Solimine observed federal agents through a closed-circuit camera as they approached his house, and he fled through a rear entrance, toward a large boat moored there, before being arrested. Mr. Ryan added that Mr. Solimine is an Italian citizen and “owns property and has family south of Naples.”One of Mr. Solimine’s defense lawyers, Marc Fernich, said his client had lived in this country for 40 years and raised five children here. Mr. Solimine panicked when he saw the agents, and was not trying to escape, he added.“He was going nowhere,” Mr. Fernich said. “It would’ve taken him a half-hour to unmoor the boat.”While the case’s timing prevents a crisis in the availability of heating oil, it has nevertheless sent ripples of unease among suppliers and customers, said John Maniscalco of the New York Oil Heating Association.Local suppliers, who use transporters like Mystic and T & S to deliver their products, have been “inundated with phone calls” from customers who suspect they have been defrauded.“The brush comes out and paints the entire industry as not being honest,” Mr. Maniscalco said. “That’s what’s most distressing about this whole thing.”Mystic Tank Lines has a fleet of 300 vehicles, which carry gasoline, asphalt and cement, as well as heating oil. In a disclosure statement filed in 2005, when Mystic was operating in bankruptcy, it claimed to transport “most of the heating fuels utilized to supply the thousands of homes and buildings that rely on oil heat” in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut.'"
"'07-08-02,'1','RIO DE JANEIRO, Aug. 1 (AP) — Moments before their jetliner skidded off a runway and exploded as it slammed into a building, pilots of the TAM Airlines Flight 3054 screamed, “Slow down!” and “Turn, turn, turn!” flight recorder transcripts disclosed Wednesday.The horrific details read before a congressional commission investigating air safety suggest that mechanical failure or pilot error contributed to the accident last month in São Paulo. If verified, that conclusion would take some heat off a government widely blamed for failing to improve the challenging runway, which pilots worldwide liken to landing on an aircraft carrier.The pilots were unable to activate the spoilers, aerodynamic brakes on the Airbus A320’s wings, as they touched down on the short, rain-slicked runway at Congonhas airport, according to the transcripts.“Only one reverser — spoiler nothing,” the pilot, Kleyber Lima, 54, says in the transcript, giving the first indication that something was wrong.The co-pilot, Henrique Stephanini Di Sacco, 54, says: “Look at that. Slow down, slow down.” Mr. Lima replies: “I can’t. I can’t. Oh my God! Oh my God!”Mr. Di Sacco’s last words are: “Go! Go! Turn! Turn! Turn!”The recording ends with screams and a woman’s voice, followed by an explosion. The July 17 crash, Brazil’s deadliest air disaster, killed all 187 people aboard the jetliner and 12 people on the ground.'"
"'07-08-02,'1','While JaMarcus Russell remains home in Alabama without a contract, Daunte Culpepper practiced with the Oakland Raiders for the first time yesterday after signing his one-year deal. Culpepper, a former Pro Bowl quarterback, had been looking for work since being released last month by Miami.“I like to take chances like that,” the Raiders’ owner, Al Davis, said. “I don’t know what the risk is. I don’t see any real risk.”Davis likened the move to one he made in 1979 when he signed Jim Plunkett, who went on to win two Super Bowl titles in Oakland. But Culpepper’s stay in Oakland might not be that long. He has only a one-year contract, and Russell will be groomed to take over as soon as he signs his contract and comes into camp.“He’s obviously the quarterback of this team in the future, so whatever it’s going to be,” Culpepper said. “I feel that I’m here for a reason: No. 1 to help this team, help myself and also help him any way I can.”Coach Lane Kiffin said Culpepper would work his way into the rotation and have a chance to win the starting job. Culpepper and Kiffin said there was not a timeline for that process.'"
"'07-08-02,'1','She urges residents to remove food from vacant houses and install double locks, double window panes, shutters, barking-dog alarms and metal containers, or bear boxes, with keys to secure garbage. Ms. Bryant helped push through legislation requiring bear boxes on new construction. Others suggest that the boxes are part of the problem.“We didn’t hardly have any break-ins before we had the boxes,” said Deputy Sheriff John Lasagna of Placer County.“Bear-proofing trash is the right thing to do, but it can cause problems in the short term as bears try to find ways to replace those missing calories,” said Linda Masterson, author of “Living with Bears: A Practical Guide to Bear Country” (PixyJack Press, 2006).There are 250 to 500 bears around Tahoe, and everyone seems to have a bear story. Last year bears stole a prize-winning gingerbread house from a refrigerator at a local resort. When a bear broke into the home of Marvis Stoecker several years ago, it licked clean huge jars of peanut butter and mayonnaise but dumped the pickled okra. Ms. Bryant recalls one morning feeling a nudge on her elbow while stirring oatmeal. A bear wanted breakfast.Adult black bears can weigh as much as 400 pounds, and while many have lost their fear of humans, they are capable of inflicting harm.Some bears in the Tahoe area now forgo winter dozing in favor of daily dining made possible by human habitation. Rather than losing weight in winter, some gain and give birth to more offspring than in the wild, said Carl Lackey, a biologist who specializes in black bears for the Nevada Department of Wildlife. Mr. Lackey has studied Tahoe bears for 10 years.In late July, bears returned to Ward Creek where the Hydes live, punching out the door of a large house and nabbing chicken patties, hot dogs and vanilla ice cream.At an older house with wooden bars on windows and a radio blasting, they plowed through the front door, leaving a calling card on the front stoop: a licked-clean container of Pillsbury chocolate frosting. At a third house with a bear carved into a wooden welcome sign, they clawed through a particle-board door and electrical wires, littering the property with discarded wrappers from M&Ms and other candies.With the increase in break-ins, at least three neighborhood families plan to give up their vacations to defend their homes.One July morning Ms. Bryant, who is not paid for her work with bears, spent time coaxing a 65-pound cub to leave its habitat behind Starbucks. She shot it with nontoxic paintballs and blanks from a starter pistol and hollered until it fled.Then she dashed to the Hydes’ neighborhood where she was joined by Sheriff Lasagna armed with a shotgun and rubber ball bullets. Tromping through the woods, Ms. Bryant fired her starter pistol eight times. If the bears kept returning, she feared that they would have to be killed.Sheriff Lasagna took off after the mother bear although both he and Ms. Bryant knew it would return. The bear’s cubs were high up in a conifer hard by one of the houses they had raided. Ms. Bryant bemoaned the fact that a mother bear was teaching her cubs that this was the way to forage.Once a bear becomes a nuisance, California residents can request a depredation permit to have it killed, although that creates new risks. Recently one homeowner found his bear trap sabotaged and signs posted with his name, phone number and the appellation “bear killer.”“I feel violated. There’s a predator out there who wants something I have,” said Mr. Hyde, who admits he feels conflicted. “Nobody wants a depredation permit because of the residual community reaction.”His wife, Catherine, said, “There’s no good solution.”After Ms. Bryant had given up for the day, neighbors screwed thick plywood to the gaping hole in the particle-board door where bears had swiped M&Ms and other sweets. By morning there was a hole in the new plywood. The refrigerator door was ajar. The bears had returned.'"
"'07-08-02,'1','Hollinger Inc., the Canadian company that Conrad M. Black used to control his newspaper empire, filed for bankruptcy yesterday and said it would explore options for the Sun-Times Media Group while facing payments on debt and shareholder suits.Hollinger, with a majority voting interest in Sun-Times, named six directors to the Sun-Times board to gain a majority and filed for bankruptcy protection in Canada and the United States, the company said.Hollinger owns about 70 percent of the voting shares and 20 percent of the equity in Sun-Times, publisher of The Chicago Sun-Times and community newspapers in the region.It asked an Ontario court to supervise a restructuring of the company, provide it protection from creditors during the process and suspend all lawsuits. A similar application was made in the United States pursuant to Chapter 15 of the bankruptcy code, Hollinger said. Sun-Times, based in Chicago, had sued Hollinger and Mr. Black, 62, to recover $542 million it says Mr. Black and the holding company looted. A federal court jury in Chicago convicted Mr. Black on July 13 on three counts of mail fraud and one count of obstruction of justice. He is free on $21 million bail and awaiting sentencing on Nov. 30.Meanwhile, a federal judge denied Mr. Black’s request to travel to Canada while awaiting his sentencing, after receiving a letter yesterday from a Canadian official saying that American prosecutors may have difficulty retrieving him if the request is granted.Judge Amy J. St. Eve cited a possibility that Mr. Black, who is Canadian-born, could try to stay in his native country and then fight extradition to the United States.Mr. Black had offered to waive his right to contest extradition.But the Canadian official, Thomas Beveridge of the Canadian Department of Justice, wrote that “lack of express statutory authority to enforce these prior undertakings gives rise to the possibility of extensive litigation in our courts.”'"

"'07-08-02,'1','Rescue workers halted their efforts this afternoon to search the waters of the Mississippi River in Minneapolis for dozens of people still missing in the wreckage of a collapsed highway bridge after strong currents blocked their work.Four people are confirmed dead in the collapse, officials said. That figure is likely to rise as bodies of the missing, who are estimated to be at least 20 to about 30, are recovered from vehicles that fell into the river on Wednesday evening from the Interstate 35W bridge. The span, which was being resurfaced at the time, was filled with backed up rush-hour traffic when it gave way just after 6 p.m. Central time. Another 79 people were injured, officials said.At least a dozen cars and trucks are in the river, officials said. Other vehicles remained on the pavement as it fell as much as 60 feet, and could be seen resting on the broken roadway as it lay on the river and its banks. Rescuers are working both on land and in the water, said Chief Tim Dolan of the Minneapolis Police Department.Chief Dolan estimated that 20 to 30 people were missing in the bridge collapse. Mary Dooley, executive director of the Iowa Rivers chapter of the Red Cross, reported a higher number: 65 people still missing.Richard Stanek, the Hennepin County sheriff, said that about 12 cars could be seen submerged in the river, and there are probably more out of sight below the surface.Inspector Jeff Storms of the sheriff’s department, is dive team leader for the search. He said debris in the water was causing “eddies,” or swirling water, making it flow faster in some areas. Until the search was halted divers were going in two at a time, with two backup divers waiting in case of emergency, Inspector Storms said.“We’re regrouping for the safety of the divers,” he said. “We’re making sure we’re taking this methodically.”At Hennepin County Medical Center in downtown Minneapolis, less than two miles from bridge, 15 victims were being treated today, with 5 of them in critical condition. One person treated at the hospital died, and the cause was reported as drowning; eight others were treated and released.Forty more people were admitted last night to the University of Minnesota Medical Center-Fairview, of whom five had arrived by ambulance. Today, 16 of them were still being treated, and were reported in good or fair condition.About 10 families gathered today at the Holiday Inn in Minneapolis, where officials had set up an assistance center for them. Most were awaiting information about missing relatives.Chief Dolan described wrenching scenes during the rescue. One severely injured person who was talking to medical workers managed to say goodbye to family members before dying, he said.Officials said that the recovery operation could take three to five days, and the bridge was being treated as a crime scene, though indications are that it collapsed. The federal Homeland Security Department said it was not a terror act, The Associated Press reported.“This is a catastrophe of historic proportions for Minnesota,” Gov. Tim Pawlenty said at a news conference late Wednesday evening.Today, the governor called for inspections to ensure that the state does not have another bridge of the same type, according to The Star Tribune of Minneapolis. “The first thing we’re going to do is make sure that we immediately inspect and check all bridges of this design and that fall into this category on the assessment scale, ” Governor Pawlenty said.Across the nation, other states, including Arizona, Michigan, New Jersey and New Mexico ordered inspections of their own, The A.P. reported.The Minneapolis bridge, which is the state’s busiest and carries an average of about 140,000 vehicles a day according to the state transportation department. It was classified as “structurally deficient” in a federal report, the Associated Press reported.Mr. Pawlenty said this morning that a federal government report on the bridge, making an assessment based on data provided by the state, “called for inspections, which we did, 2005-2006. Inspectors on the ground said yes, there is some fatigue in the bridge, but it doesn’t rise to the level of being immediately replaced. In fact, it was slotted for replacement in about 2020.”He said later in the day that a final review of the bridge had been planned for September, after the current construction was completed, to determine if the bridge should be fixed or replaced.The Minnesota Department of Transportation “did everything appropriate,” said Mary E. Peters, secretary of the federal Department of Transportation, speaking to reporters at a press conference today. “But clearly we need to understand what happened here, Ms. Peters said, adding, “Bridges in America should not fall down.”“This is the first time in a very long time we have seen something like this happen,” she said. “This is, to my knowledge, the second time we’ve seen a bridge of this magnitude go down without some specific reason, like a barge, since 1983.” That was the year that a bridge collapsed along Interstate 95 in Connecticut.Since then, federal transportation officials have incorporated improvements to their bridge inspection and rehabilitation program, Ms. Peters said.Such changes were of little help to Melissa A. Hughes, 32, a warehouse manager, who was headed southward over the bridge in a route that would have taken her past downtown Minneapolis.“I was on the bridge when it happened,” said Ms. Hughes. “I was driving home from work. It was bumper to bumper.”She was on a section of bridge that was remained above the land, but about three car lengths ahead of her, suddenly everything dropped from view.“My sensation was seeing this thing suspended in air, you could tell the cars were not level, and I swear I saw a construction worker in the air,” she said. And then she experienced what she described as a “a free fall feeling, like on an amusement ride.”“There was a huge smashing sound, and it was my back window getting blown in,” she said.She loosened her seatbelt, opened the door easily enough, but when she got out she found that her car had ended up at a 45-degree angle.“And when I was on ground I could see it was a pickup truck had landed upside down on my car,” Luckily, Ms. Hughes said, it was the bed section of the truck, which meant that it did not go past the back seat.She and others around her gathered. “We all knew this bridge goes over the river and how fortunate we were to be on the section we were on, and not into the water,” she said.She has a stiff neck and back.“It happened so fast,” she said. “I knew I was safe on ground at 6:06 p.m., when I was calling my husband.”Mark Rosenker, chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board, said today that 19 inspectors would be arriving in Minneapolis to investigate the cause of the bridge’s collapse, and they would review the engineering of the bridge, the highway and its materials, among other things. He estimated that the N.T.S.B. would complete its report in about a year.President Bush, in a news conference today, expressed condolences for the victims and said “the federal government must respond and respond robustly to help the people there not only recover, but to make sure that lifeline of activity, that bridge, gets rebuilt as quickly as possible.” The White House later announced that Mr. Bush would travel to Minneapolis on Saturday.Ms. Peters announced that the Department of Transportation would send $5 million to Minneapolis to help to “give crews the support they need to begin restoring traffic flow, clearing debris, setting up detours, and making repairs.”The bridge was eight lanes wide, and carried the main north-south highway through Minneapolis. It was being repaired at the time it collapsed, and a witness told MSNBC that he had heard a jackhammer being used on the roadway just beforehand. Witnesses said the bridge, which was built in 1967, collapsed in three sections. One section of the bridge lay flat in the river, with some cars and trucks resting on the pavement.The collapsed bridge, which was about 1,000 feet long, had been supported by a steel truss structure of somewhat unusual design. Repairs were being made to the bridge’s concrete deck, guard rails and lights, state officials said.The construction work was being done by Progressive Contractors Inc. of St. Michael, Minn. Tom Sloan, the company’s vice president for bridges, told the television station KARE that 18 workers were on the bridge at the time of the collapse and one was missing.Divers and rescue boats continued to search the river and the twisted wreckage of the bridge for survivors as darkness set in and rain began to fall. The Star Tribune said some people were seen floundering in the river, calling for help.Leah R. Fulin, 16, of Minneapolis, had just crossed the bridge and was on the Washington Avenue exit ramp when it collapsed behind her.“Most of the cars that were on the bridge went into the river,” she said. “There was a whole bunch of smoke when concrete breaks like that. There were people screaming.”Janet Stately was returning from Duluth, Minn., and had decided to take an adjacent bridge to avoid traffic when the collapse occurred.“I heard an awful noise and saw what looked to me like a piece of the freeway just going down flat,” Ms. Stately said. Then she said she saw the road collapse into a V and cars rolling into the river. “I clearly recall horns honking. I was screaming. We were trying to call 911 on our cellphones.”A school bus could be seen on one section of the collapsed roadway, with its back door open. Red Cross officials said 60 children were taken off the bus by rescuers, and 10 of them had injuries that were treated at city hospitals. A short distance away from the bus, a tractor-trailer caught fire and burned.“I saw a lot of crying,” Courtney Johnson of the Red Cross told CNN. “Some of the older children were comforting the younger children.” The children were 4 to 12 or 13 years in age, Ms. Johnson estimated.The children were in a summer program, on the way to a swimming pool. Jeremy Hernandez, 20, a gym coordinator for the program, said he was sleeping on the bus when he heard a boom and thought the bus had been in an accident. Then the bus kept falling, it crashed, and then it fell again. When it stopped, the children on the bus were moaning and crying.When the dust settled, “they all started screaming,” said Mr. Hernandez. “They wanted their parents and wanted to hold on to all the staff, they didn’t want to let go.”He opened the back door of the bus and passed children out to others. Berndt Toivonen, 51, of Minneapolis, told The Star Tribune he had been on his way home from a painting job when the bridge collapsed beneath his car.“The bridge started to buckle,” Mr. Toivonen said. “It went up and it came down. I thought I was going to die.” He was uninjured, but he said people around him, some injured, were screaming in their cars. He told MSNBC that he helped some other people off the bridge.Dr. Joseph Clinton, chief of emergency medicine at Hennepin County Medical Center, said six patients at the hospital had critical injuries and 22 had injuries that were not considered life threatening. There was one drowning fatality, Dr. Clinton said.“This is a very busy bridge,” said Senator Amy Klobuchar, Democrat of Minnesota, whose home is nearby. “It’s really right in the heart of the city,” Ms. Klobuchar told CNN. “Thousands of commuters use this bridge every day.”According to the Minnesota Department of Transportation, the flow on the eight lanes of I-35W crossing the river was supposed to be restricted beginning Tuesday night for the northbound lanes and at 8 last night, about two hours after the collapse, for the southbound lanes. The reason stated on the agency’s Web site was “overlay work,” which refers to roadway resurfacing.The Minnesota Twins, who play home games in the Metrodome not far from the site of the bridge collapse, had a moment of silence before their game Wednesday night. Team officials decided to play Wednesday’s game after public safety officials decided that sending 20,000 to 25,000 people back into traffic could hinder rescue efforts, the Twins’ president, Dave St. Peter, told The Associated Press. Today’s game against the Kansas City Royals has been postponed, along with a groundbreaking ceremony for a new baseball stadium, according to the Twins Web site.'"
"'07-08-02,'1','Many of the anonymous quotes in the Vanity Fair piece seem to have come from past and present Giuliani employees, who are particularly bitter about Judith’s alleged attempts to elbow out his closest aides and confidants. This is not something you as a voter need to worry about since Giuliani’s closest aides and confidants tend to be extremely expendable hangers-on.The more problematic question is whether Rudy is so gaga over the lady that he will let her do anything she wants. If you elect him president, will you wake up a few months later and discover that Judith is Avian Flu Czar? Inquiring voters want to know.There are three possible roles for the modern political wife/husband: Partner, Decorative Accessory or AWOL. We’re knee-deep in partners these days, with Bill and Hillary and Elizabeth and John. But there’s nothing to suggest Judith Giuliani can play in those leagues. In fact, although the campaign has tried to launch her several times, she’s showed absolutely no aptitude even for the role of admiring spouse.She kept one of her divorces under wraps for a long while, trying to convince the world that Rudy was only her second husband. (The first rule of politics is to never lie about things that are quantifiable.)In a rare speaking appearance at a fund-raiser last spring, she began with an anecdote about when they first met that was both unwise, given his married state at the time, and unlikely. (“The first time we sat down and talked I said: ‘What do you know about infectious diseases?’ ”)Things did not really improve from there on in.To protect his wife from unnecessary sniping, all Rudy needs to do is say that he was looking at the world through the eyes of love when he seemed to be envisioning her as a future weapons inspector. (“She gives us a lot of advice and a lot of help in areas where she’s got a tremendous amount of expertise — biological and chemical,” he said in 2003.)They can jointly announce that while he campaigns, she’s decided to return to her true love and raise money for hospitals. They will need all the help they can get if his health care plan ever goes into effect.Already, we can detect baby steps in this direction. Asked yesterday to describe Judith’s role in the Giuliani race, McKeon said: “She is involved with the campaign in terms of helping out with the fund-raising.”'"

"'07-08-03,'0','MINNEAPOLIS, Aug. 3 — An official estimate of the number of people still missing after the collapse of a highway bridge over the Mississippi River fell sharply today to as few as eight, as divers continued to search the water for more bodies.The news on the lower estimate of the missing — which had been 20 to 30 — came as officials announced that a fifth body had been pulled from the wreckage. More than 70 were injured when the bridge fell 60 feet during rush hour on Wednesday evening.Rich Stanek, the sheriff of Hennepin County, said the number of those missing dropped to about eight after family members located their loved ones in hospitals and elsewhere.But the Minneapolis police department declined to give an estimate. “We are working very hard to try to understand what is real in terms of who may be missing,” said Sara Dietrich, a spokeswoman for the police department, “We’re just not giving a number. We don’t feel confident in it.”She said some 1,200 people called the Red Cross and other authorities Wednesday night to inquire about possibly missing loved ones. So many calls were made that the cell phone circuits were overwhelmed that night.Ultimately some people feared missing arrived home. Others were located in hospitals and others are considered missing. “This is not easy to sort out,” Ms. Dietrich said.Divers focused their search today on the part of the river upstream of the collapsed bridge, where four cars have been spotted, along with nine other objects that might be vehicles. One vehicle lay directly under another and cannot be checked until heavy equipment is in place, Sheriff Stanek said.Officials in the sheriff’s office said this afternoon that 12 vehicles have been found in the water so far, and another 60 were in the wreckage, but not in the water.“We will be slow and methodical in our search operations today,” said Sheriff Stanek, who said the debris from the bridge had created dangerous currents and eddies in the river. While visibility for the divers has been only about six inches today, the searching has gone better than expected because the Army Corps of Engineers lowered the level of the river by two feet, making submerged objects at least partially visible.Officials in the sheriff’s office said that divers were identifying cars from their licenses, then relaying that information to officers on land. Then the divers are swimming around the cars, and then going into them to search for victims, they said.Sheriff Stanek reported that no human remains have been recovered today. Divers were going into the water in teams of three, one to search and two to be available to rescue the searchers, if needed. Sixteen boats were to be deployed in the recovery effort, double the number used on Thursday.Officials said the recovery efforts would probably continue through the weekend.First Lady Laura Bush, in Minneapolis on a previously scheduled trip, visited the site and spoke to rescue workers. President Bush was scheduled to visit on Saturday.Sheriff Stanek said in a televised interview that searches on Thursday downstream of the bridge had identified four objects: a vehicle that apparently plunged from the bridge, a pick-up truck that had been in the river for a long time, debris from the bridge itself and scaffolding from renovation work that was underway when the bridge collapsed.He said today’s efforts would focus on objects upstream from the I-35 bridge that had been identified by side scanning sonar. He said power company officials would inspect a large power line that runs across the riverbed farther upstream from the collapse site. He said the line could be jeopardized if heavy equipment were brought to the area to help demolish the remains of the bridge.Mark Rosenker, the chairman of the National Transportation Safety board said officials of the agency would begin a frame-by-frame analysis of the video that captured the collapse of the bridge and examine a computer model built by an engineering student. Eventually, he said, some parts of the bridge could be reconstructed downstream as part of an effort to understand why it fell.The search for victims — those missing since they left their offices, grocery stores and gymnasiums Wednesday evening — was halted repeatedly on Thursday as currents picked up, debris shifted and the waters grew impossibly cloudy.With the cause of the collapse unknown, the federal Transportation Department said it had told all states to inspect bridges similar to the steel-deck truss span that fell “or, at minimum, review inspection reports to determine if further action is needed.” The department said there were 756 such bridges.The bridge here was deemed “structurally deficient” in 1990, state engineers said, in part because of some corroded bearings, but it was not expected to be replaced until 2020.Dan Dorgan, a state bridge engineer for the Minnesota Department of Transportation, said a “deficient” designation did not mean a bridge needed to be immediately replaced; 77,000 bridges across the country, he said, have a similar designation.Still, Mr. Dorgan said: “We thought had done all we could. Obviously something went terribly wrong.”Gov. Tim Pawlenty declared a state of emergency and federal transportation officials pledged $5 million for the cleanup and recovery, as Safety Board officials began their investigation into why the eight-lane bridge, which opened in 1967 and became a staple for most Minneapolis commuters, had in a matter of seconds fallen 60 feet in a cloud of dust.On Thursday, families of the missing made desperate pleas, showing the authorities photographs of their loved ones and reciting license plate numbers and car models to look for.As the families waited grimly in a Red Cross center, hour after hour, those who had survived recovered in hospitals, still dazed by what they had escaped.“When I saw that the bridge before me was collapsing, I thought it was an illusion,” Thuy T. Vo said from her hospital bed here. “Then the cement hit the windshield, and I thought I would die right there.”Ms. Vo, a 26-year-old stay-at-home mother, was halfway across the bridge when she heard a loud crack, saw the bridge before her suddenly fade away and watched as her Mazda van turned straight downward. Then it went over.As water filled the van, Ms. Vo, who does not swim, rolled down a window and somehow paddled away.Ms. Vo, whose injuries were mostly scrapes, said she had seen five or six cars drop off the bridge in front of her. The image of them plays over in her head, she said, a flash of a few seconds again and again. She said she did not know if anyone in those cars survived, adding, “I am very lucky.”Around this city, oddly quiet but for helicopters circling, residents were reeling. Churches held prayer services. Yellow police tape cordoned off block after block near the river, but downtown workers streamed to tall places — high rises, hills, outdoor theaters — to get a glimpse of the rubble.Atop one hill, a crowd of 30 people stood under a boiling sun, silent and staring. One visitor under an umbrella said she simply could not digest what had happened, even as she stared.On the waters below, divers on barges used sonar devices and global positioning systems to track the cars in the river. But they faced numerous setbacks, and the authorities said the process might take days or longer.At one point on Thursday, the currents were simply too strong, and the debris too thick in the water, to go on. At another point, members of the Army Corps of Engineers tried to slow the river’s flow to lower the water’s nine-foot depth, but found that this created a dangerous suction effect and told the divers to halt once more.Mr. Pawlenty promised a thorough investigation of what went wrong and said the state would hire an outside firm to conduct it, even as the federal safety board began conducting its own. He said he would hire a second company to investigate the state’s bridge inspection methods. He also announced immediate inspections of the state’s three other bridges that mimic the design of the 35W bridge.Mr. Pawlenty said the issue of old, crumbling bridges and roads, however, stretched far beyond Minnesota’s borders. “This is a national problem,” he said.Many of the nation’s highways and bridges are as old as the bridge here or older, and in recent months leaders in Congress have been debating how to pay for so many needed improvements.While the closing of the roadway snarled traffic Thursday, few here were talking yet about rebuilding, a job Mr. Pawlenty said might cost as much as $350 million.In Washington, President Bush and other officials offered prayers and assistance.“We in the federal government must respond and respond robustly to help the people there not only recover, but to make sure that lifeline of activity, that bridge, gets rebuilt as quickly as possible,” Mr. Bush said.Mary E. Peters, the secretary of Transportation, traveled to the scene of the disaster. Ms. Peters said Minnesota’s transportation officials seemed to have done “everything appropriate” in their monitoring of the bridge.“But clearly we need to understand what happened here,” she said. “Bridges in America should not fall down.”Along the Mississippi on Thursday evening, some people said they found themselves looking at every bridge warily. They said they were also struggling with the ordinariness of the moments before the collapse, with none of the warnings that might come before a hurricane or tornado or even the mild worry they might feel getting onto an airplane.Greg Bernstein, a 41-year-old computer consultant who lives not far from the bridge, had been passing nearby when it collapsed. Mr. Bernstein said he had tried to help and calm the people he found, strangers whose first names were now etched in his mind — Dave, Jason, Hector — until the emergency crews arrived.But he said he kept thinking about one car he never got to. It was tipped at a steep incline, a highway sign crushing the hood. Mr. Bernstein said he had glimpsed someone’s arm inside the car and wished he had gone over to assist.“You keep playing it over in your own mind,” he said. “All the stuff you couldn’t do.”'"
"'07-08-03,'0','Also, “this is a big, big moneymaker,” she said, since many large companies — Enron, Delta, Northwest and Delphi — have reorganized in the last six years.Like many old-line firms, Cravath had a history of developing talent from within, hewing to a founding principle that a Cravath partner was made, not born. (Lawyers at Cravath remember only one previous outside, or “lateral,” hire before Mr. Levin, and that was a tax lawyer three years ago.)The “Cravath System” is laid out in a musty rose-colored book, “The Cravath Firm and Its Predecessors: 1819-1947,” a 1948 work by Robert T. Swaine, given to every lawyer upon being named a partner. The book notes the wisdom of the firm’s founder, Paul Cravath, who believed that lawyers should be recruited from law schools rather than from other firms.“Cravath men,” the book says, should be “taken to the shallow water and carefully taught strokes.”“While recognizing the risks of too much inbreeding, Cravath insisted that new partners be chosen from within the office, unless special requirements otherwise compelled,” according to Volume II of Mr. Swaine’s tome.Cravath’s deputy presiding partner, C. Allen Parker, said the firm took its time starting a restructuring practice, in part because it needed to get over “the historical hesitation to go outside.”Mainly, Mr. Parker said, the firm was seeking to serve its clients when they found themselves as creditors. Many of Cravath’s clients have landed on creditors’ committees in prominent bankruptcy cases, he said, and the firm has helped them find another firm as bankruptcy counsel.That has meant that the fees generated by those cases also went elsewhere.While Mr. Parker does not foreclose the chance of representing debtors — which is often considered the more lucrative side of the bankruptcy practice — for now, it is an effort to serve clients who are pulled into the cases.Mr. Levin, a Yale Law School graduate who had tried to get in the swing of Skadden’s summer casual dress policy but quickly returned to the uniform of his dark suit, should get along nicely with his new colleagues at Cravath, where summer casual was never in fashion.“I was very reluctant to leave Skadden,” said Mr. Levin, who had been a partner there for 10 years, eight of them in Los Angeles. “With a phone call like this, I at least had to have the meeting.”While Cravath did go outside to hire Mr. Levin, it plans to build his department from within — a couple of banking partners and a litigation associate have expressed interest, he said.Mr. Levin’s move reflects the fact that bankruptcy lawyers have become a hot commodity at many large firms. The game of trading in “lateral partners” has gained steam: Harvey R. Miller, perhaps the most outsize personality in the field, made headlines when he returned to his home at the New York firm of Weil, Gotshal & Manges from the investment house Greenhill & Company, in March.A day after Mr. Miller returned, four prominent Weil restructuring partners moved to Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft. The New York office of O’Melveny & Myers hired five partners from Stroock & Stroock & Lavan this spring. And Steven Wilamowsky, a Willkie Farr & Gallagher partner, was persuaded to join Bingham McCutcheon’s restructuring group at the beginning of this year.Firms seeking to bulk up their bankruptcy practices are simply following the money, which, in bankruptcy, means the prospect of ever- increasing fees.Lynn M. LoPucki, a professor at the U.C.L.A. Law School and a critic of high legal fees, has analyzed the rise in fees in recent years. Professor LoPucki conducted a study of fees in the “megacases” from 1998 to 2003. Fees increased 8.6 percent a year in that period for a total of 51 percent in all fee applications.A recent update by Professor LoPucki, tracking 26 corporate bankruptcies, showed that fees increased by 12 percent a year since 2003.Professor LoPucki sees more of the same ahead.“The surprising thing,” he said, “is that the fees are not going up faster because no one is controlling them: The debtor is not spending their own money, the creditor is never sure whose money is being spent and the courts can’t control the fees, because if they do, they won’t get more cases.”Everyone, it seems, is preparing for a coming wave of new bankruptcy filings. J. Gregory Milmoe, head of the restructuring department at Skadden Arps, said he expected the firm’s department, which has dropped from a high of 120 lawyers in 2002 to about 100 worldwide, to crest again to 120 next year.“We have lost a number of people to hedge funds, trading desks and in-house counsel,” Mr. Milmoe said.He said the firm’s managing partner, Robert C. Sheehan, had “made a case that there is a tsunami coming” in the bankruptcy arena.Mr. Levin, for his part, carefully concedes, “The business cycle has not been repealed.”'"
"'07-08-03,'0','But in talking to a wide range of hedge fund investors, it is clear that a number of hedge funds had a bad month. The superstar trader James Pallota, who runs the Tudor Investment Raptor Funds, is down 9 percent for the month and 3 percent for the year. Caxton, run by Bruce Kovner, is down 3 percent for the month but remains up for the year (both Mr. Kovner and Mr. Pallota have extraordinary long-term records).On Monday, Sowood Capital, a $3 billion fund with $15 billion worth of positions run by a pedigreed manager from Harvard’s endowment, announced it would shutter its funds seemingly overnight, leaving Harvard’s endowment with a $350 million loss. Many are expecting negative results to far outweigh positive ones as all hedge funds report July results in the next few weeks.Private equity firms would seem to be in even worse shape. The problems in private equity are well known. The Blackstone Group, which went public at $35, is currently trading around $25. A rival, Kohlberg, Kravis & Roberts, filed to go public but many question whether that will happen any time soon.The problem is that the debt market, which financed a parade of deals with cheap debt, has shut down. The funds have huge amounts of capital to spend but no money to borrow to do the deals. The deals they have done, and are doing, are hard to hedge.So hedge fund titans can be glad they are not private equity moguls, right? Wrong.Conversations with investors over the last few days suggest they are on pins and needles. Two Bear Stearns hedge funds invested in subprime blew up, a third Bear fund with very little subprime exposure had to halt redemptions and Sowood went so long almost overnight. Many stocks with significant hedge fund ownership — Sears, Wendy’s, WCI — were pummeled in July.Nervous investors are awaiting monthly numbers, which most hedge funds provide. If the investors want out, and they have fulfilled any requirement to keep the money in the fund for a certain amount of time, they can pull their capital. Too many redemptions can force funds to sell into a bad market, resulting in worse losses. In other words, the investors can be as much the problem as the markets.The benefit to being a private equity fund right now is that private equity investors are not clamoring for month-end numbers and demanding to know what the fund will do differently to turn around performance. The funds are not stuck selling into a falling market, or with weird illiquid credit instruments with no prices. They do not have to mark their positions the way hedge funds do, which allows them breathing room. The banks are the ones stuck with the loans and as the market falls, the private equity funds’ targets become cheaper.The leverage they have put on companies will probably start to become a problem. But portfolios are designed to weather a few disasters.All of which brings about the ultimate paradox, which is the very bizarre logic of both private equity funds and hedge funds racing to go public. Clearly, the markets can be difficult for everyone. But it is tougher on those who deliver monthly numbers and who manage investors with an every-month mentality. This is inevitably what you get with public markets: short-termism.Certainly the folks going public like Blackstone and Kohlberg, Kravis are selling only small amounts of their company, giving investors little to no power and insisting that they will not run their businesses for the short-term.Perhaps. But it may be worth checking in with the hedge fund guys fielding panicked calls from investors who want to know what happened in July. And what will happen in August and September. By then, fall will be upon us and the anniversary of many bad investing memories. A season, one might say, to cover up.'"
"'07-08-03,'0','HELSINKI, Finland, Aug. 2 (AP) — The Nokia Corporation reinforced its position as the world’s top cellphone maker in a strong second quarter, reporting an increase in its market share on Thursday amid surging growth in emerging markets.Its earnings beat market expectations, and its stock rose 8 percent.Net profit for the April-June period rose to 2.82 billion euros ($3.85 billion) from 1.14 billion euros in 2006, the Finnish company said. Sales grew 28 percent, to 12.6 billion euros from 9.8 billion euros.Nokia sold 100 million mobile devices in the period, an increase of 29 percent over 2006, while the overall industry growth was about 14 percent, with 262 million mobile devices sold globally, Nokia said.But the group again warned about the performance of its troubled network operations, describing market conditions as challenging because of heavy competition.“We shall have to increase the amount and speed of cost cutting,” the chief executive, Olli-Pekka Kallasvuo, said, giving no details.'"
"'07-08-03,'0','Hamas won a legislative majority in January 2006, but Fatah never agreed to accept it, and the United States and Israel refused to deal with Hamas, which they classify as a terrorist organization, unless it accepted Israel’s right to exist and agreed to give up violence.Ms. Rice said it was up to the Palestinians to decide when to hold a new vote, but the Americans, like the Israelis, have told Mr. Abbas they will not accept a renewal of a unity government with Hamas.Mr. Abbas said Thursday that he would not try to reconcile with Hamas unless they “reverse everything they did” and “apologize to the Palestinian people — then we might reconsider.”It would be nearly impossible for Mr. Abbas to hold an early vote unless Hamas agreed to one. Mr. Abbas told Ms. Rice that he was ready to work with Israel on a “declaration of principles” as an interim step toward a full peace agreement, an idea floated last week by Prime Minister Ehud Olmert of Israel. Such a declaration, as envisioned by Israel, would outline the contours of a future Palestinian state, without immediately tackling the most explosive issues, like final borders and the fate of Palestinian refugees.Mr. Abbas said Thursday that once such a declaration had been negotiated, “what is important is that we arrive at a result and that we know what that result is, what is the roof that we need to reach, but the stages of implementation can be agreed on later.”Separately on Wednesday and Thursday, Ms. Rice met with Mr. Olmert and other senior Israeli officials to discuss plans for Mr. Bush’s fall conference on Palestinian-Israeli peace.Her meetings in the West Bank ended a three-day swing through the region that included stops in Egypt and Saudi Arabia, where she pressed for Arab support for the conference.Ms. Rice’s trip was the first high-level American visit to Israel and the West Bank since the Gaza takeover.Since then, Mr. Abbas — and the world — have largely left Gaza to itself to be governed by Hamas, focusing aid and diplomatic efforts on the West Bank, where Mr. Abbas’s Fatah forces remain in control. The United States, Israel and the European Union have all welcomed the dissolution of the Palestinian government.Mr. Bush quickly unfroze $86 million in aid, which was put into the deep freeze after Hamas won the 2006 elections. On Thursday, Ms. Rice signed a so-called framework agreement with Mr. Fayyad, which ostensibly released the first $10 million in aid. The money is intended to strengthen Mr. Abbas’s security forces.A spokesman for Hamas in Gaza, Sami Abu Zuhri, criticized the Rice visit and the release of the aid.“She came to incite one Palestinian side against another,” he said. “She came to provide $80 million to stamp out resistance forces. Rice did not come to the region to establish a Palestinian state, as she and her master Bush claimed, but instead she came to support one Palestinian party against another, and to support the Zionist occupation.”In a statement, Mr. Olmert praised the Saudi foreign minister, Prince Saud al-Faisal, who said Wednesday that his country was leaning toward attending the Middle East meeting, but wanted it to be substantive. Mr. Olmert “shares the same approach, that the international meeting will be serious and meaningful, and he welcomes the participation of leaders of Arab countries in the meeting,” his office said.But Israeli officials also emphasized that, unlike the Saudis, the Israelis believe that the core issues of the conflict should be discussed in a bilateral format with the Palestinians, rather than in an international framework that might make them more difficult to solve.Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni said the most delicate issues should not be addressed immediately.In Gaza City on Wednesday night, at least one Palestinian was killed when Hamas tried to arrest a member of Islamic Jihad after he fired into the air at a wedding.Medical officials said that in subsequent clashes between Islamic Jihad and Hamas’s Executive Force, acting as the police, one Executive Force member was killed.'"
"'07-08-03,'0','The other victims were identified as Julia Blackhawk, 32, of Savage; Patrick Holmes, 36, of Mounds View; and Artemio Trinidad-Mena, 29, of Minneapolis.Other people held out hope that their missing sons, mothers or cousins had simply lost their way, or were alive but unconscious in a hospital.The authorities said there were as many as 30 people unaccounted for after hours of searching on land and in the water. Estimates for the number of missing varied Thursday from as low as 8 up to 30.At the Holiday Inn Metrodome, on the north side of the river near the collapse scene, the ballroom has been transformed from a place of celebration into a waiting room of the worst sort, a somber chamber where the loved ones of the missing wait for news.Every once in a while, the stress became too much and a mother or sister or best friend walked briskly through the lobby, tears streaming.“It was my son, my son,” a Nigerian woman who gave her name only as Ms. Mafe said.Asked what information she had been given, Ms. Mafe said, “Nothing.”Ms. Mafe, accompanied by a friend, seemed to lose some of her strength as she walked between the double doors at the hotel’s entrance. Her back to the glass, she wailed.“I’ve called his cellphone so many times,” she said. “It’s not picking up. Not picking up.”Asked why she thought her son might be among the dead, Ms. Mafe said that he was never out of touch, and that on Wednesday evening, he told her he was heading with his girlfriend in the direction of the I-35W span.By early afternoon, the realization that scores of people were not going to be pulled from the water was beginning to set in.Abdiaziz Ahmed, a taxi driver, said that a cousin, Sadia Adam Sahal, was missing.Mr. Ahmed had spent the night and morning shuttling his extended family from hospital to hospital, and back to the Holiday Inn again to check for updates.“We couldn’t sleep,” he said. “How can you sleep if all of your family is not O.K.?”Ms. Sahal was driving a white Toyota Highlander on Wednesday, Mr. Ahmed said. She was with her daughter, Hannah, 1, he said.The Rev. Devin Miller, of the Emmanuel Tabernacle church in south Minneapolis, said that he and other volunteers in the makeshift family waiting room at the Holiday Inn were trying their hardest just to be of comfort.An arm around a shoulder, a hand held, prayers said.“There’s just this giant sense of ‘I don’t know,’ ” Mr. Miller said. “The story is always the same: ‘I talked to my brother at 5:30, he said he was on his way home, I never heard from him again.’ ”Inside the ballroom, volunteers from the American Red Cross registered families and tried to guide them, with the help of counselors and chaplains, through the long wait.About 60 people showed up on Wednesday night. Several dozen registered on Thursday.'"
"'07-08-03,'0','WASHINGTON, Aug. 2 — President Bush said Thursday that the United States would freeze the property and assets of anyone trying to undermine Lebanon’s democratically elected government — a move intended as a sharp warning to Syria and its ally Hezbollah.The announcement, in an executive order and an accompanying letter to Congress, reflects heightened concern in Washington that Syria is trying to reassert control over Lebanon. It comes a little more than a month after the administration announced that it was enacting a travel ban, barring “those who have contributed to the breakdown of the rule of law in Lebanon,” possibly including leading Syrian intelligence officials, from entering the United States.Taken together, the steps are an effort to ratchet up pressure on Syria at a time when the administration contends that it is helping to fuel the insurgency in Iraq, as well as creating instability in Lebanon. Mr. Bush’s order deems interference in Lebanon’s government to be an “extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States,” and declares it a “national emergency.”Administration officials say they are especially concerned that the fragile democratic government in Lebanon, headed by Prime Minister Fouad Siniora, could splinter if the Lebanese president, Émile Lahoud, who has close ties to Syria, tries to establish an alternate government. That concern has grown in recent months, said an administration official involved in formulating the executive order.“We think measures like this visa ban and the executive order not only allow us to target people who are behind this and complicit in it, but they raise the cost of going along with it,” said the official, who did not have authorization to speak on the record. “There are key figures in Lebanon who could go one way or the other, who are sitting on the fence, and this is a way to try to deter them.”'"
"'07-08-03,'0','Sergeant Hardin said enforcement of the law required a dedicated investigator, a global positioning system and, each time an offender moves, hours of paperwork. At least 15 sex offenders have been arrested because of homelessness since the law took effect in July 2006, according to documents gathered through pretrial proceedings in a lawsuit brought by the Southern Center for Human Rights and the American Civil Liberties Union.The suit argues that the law leaves offenders virtually nowhere to live. Sarah Geraghty, a lawyer with the human rights center, said she had scoured the state for homeless shelters that would accept male sex offenders and could find only one, which was full. A document from the Sex Offender Administration of the Georgia Department of Corrections, provided to a reporter by Ms. Geraghty, lists what it calls “offenders arrested for being homeless.”Georgia’s law is not the only one that has made it hard for offenders to maintain legal residences. In Florida, the state authorized five offenders to live under a bridge in Miami after they were unable to find suitable housing that they could afford. In Iowa, a victims’ group found that offenders tried to comply with the registry law by offering addresses like “rest area mile marker 149” or “RV in old Kmart parking lot.” Critics of residency restrictions say they drive offenders underground and have little effect on the number of sex crimes.As a tough-on-crime measure, the Georgia law was enacted easily, with supporters saying it would force sex offenders to leave the state. “Every sex offender in Georgia will now serve time in jail, and every sex offender in Georgia will be monitored after their release,” said the House majority leader, Jerry Keen, the bill’s Republican sponsor.But the law’s opponents have called it too harsh in its penalties, too broad in its restrictions and too rigid, allowing no exceptions even when a day care center or a church opens within 1,000 feet of an offender’s pre-existing residence. One offender, Anthony Mann, was told he had to leave his house and the barbecue restaurant he owned when day care centers opened too close to both locations, according to a second lawsuit.In the case of the 40-year-old Mr. Moore, the first registry violation occurred in 2005, when the penalties were much less severe. After spending time in jail awaiting disposition of the case, he pleaded guilty to missing a deadline to re-register and was sentenced to two years’ probation.Records show that in March 2006, the month he got out of jail, he registered twice, according to officials at the public defender’s office. He registered again in April and June, and twice in July, when the new law took effect. He was left with only two places in Augusta, both hotels, that met the law’s requirements.Mr. Moore, who worked at Popeyes Chicken & Biscuits, could not afford the hotels for long, his lawyers say. An investigator at the Richmond County Sheriff’s Office told the court that when he checked several months later, Mr. Moore had moved out.'"

"'07-08-03,'0','The real thrust of the American Kennel Club’s opposition to California Assembly Bill 1634 as stated in “Should Most Pet Owners Be Required to Neuter Their Animals?” (Editorial Observer, July 30) is not economic but rather that creating a one-size-fits-all law such as mandatory spay and neuter is not a workable, enforceable solution to reduce the diverse demographics of the state’s shelter population.Lawmakers, animal control officers and animal welfare organizations need to work together and delve into the origins of shelter subgroups — such as stray, feral or surrendered pets — to address the issues that bring them to the shelter.California’s shelter populations have declined in recent decades, and most pet owners (70 percent dog, 84 percent cat) are acting responsibly and spaying/neutering their pets without government involvement. Targeted programs that address specific segments of the companion animal population and broad public education programs have been and can continue to be effective.'"
"'07-08-03,'0','The show is the second part of an examination of subway architecture and design; the first part, which closed July 8, focused on the subway’s original designers, George L. Heins and C. Grant LaFarge, whose elaborately ornate subway stations from 1904 continue to be the system’s most recognizable emblems. Organized by Carissa Amash, a Transit Museum curator, the new show, “Squire Vickers and the Subway’s Modern Age,” tells the story of the man who, in almost 30 years as the system’s lead designer, was responsible for building more of today’s subway than any other architect: over 300 stations, many more than any other architect.The exhibition dusts off samples of the many lushly colored Arts and Crafts influenced mosaics that Vickers and his staff designed in the late teens and 1920s along new lines in Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens and the Bronx. Their quiltlike geometric abstractions, evoking Piet Mondrian and Sophie Taeuber-Arp, began to put a straight edge to the subway’s swoops and curlicues, its terra-cotta cornucopias and floral medallions.“There seemed to be really no curves and almost no circles anymore — they just vanished,” Ms. Amash said one recent morning, carrying a pair of white gloves as she walked through the small exhibition space with drawings, pictures and excavated chunks of subway history around her on the walls and floor. (The steam-pipe explosion that burst through the pavement near Grand Central on July 18 happened on the very day the museum was awaiting delivery of many of its exhibits for the show. “It’s been crazy,” Ms. Amash said. “It’s New York.”)Much of Vickers’s straightening and flattening had to do with the prevailing aesthetics of his day, as Arts and Crafts restraint gave way to the austerity of the Machine Age, reflected in the just-the-facts decoration, sans-serif type and solid colors of the Independent subway, the last major expansion, in the 1930s (stations that are now along the A, C, E and F lines, among others).“How grateful to the eye is the wall surface unbroken by paneling, noxious ornament or the misplaced string course, decorated, if you like, inlaid with color, but unbroken,” he wrote.In a wall text for viewers of the exhibition, Ms. Amash added that “instead of disguising the steel and concrete structure of the subway, Arts and Crafts design allowed Vickers to celebrate the subway’s underlying industrial character, exposing concrete vaulted ceilings and leaving steel girders unadorned.”But he was also imminently practical and, as subway projects lurched through the Depression — at one point, Ms. Amash said, all but nine subway architects were laid off, including, briefly, Vickers himself — many of his aesthetic decisions were driven by the bottom line.Mosaic elements were made flat, for example, in part “to avoid dust ledges,” he wrote, so they would be cheaper to clean. They could also be set by hand in the factory instead of piece by piece on the wall, making them less expensive to install. “With Heins and LaFarge,” Ms. Amash said, “there was a point at which it was like, ‘Hey guys, you’re going to have to rein in the costs,’ but with Vickers it was pretty much a tight budget from the get-go.”In one essay Vickers explained frankly why elevated stations, as any frequent subway rider can now see, ended up badly short-changed in the design department: “Our attempts to beautify have been of little avail, except in certain cases, on account of the cost.”And yet, in many places, in design elements like a flat mosaic picture plaque at the Canal Street station on Broadway — a representation of a stone bridge crossing the canal that was later to become Canal Street — Vickers was still able pull off beautiful low-cost effects.With its deep blues, yellows and reds, that plaque (one like it is on display in the exhibition) was designed by Jay Van Everen, one of Vickers’s best friends and a fellow painter, who attended Cornell University with Vickers. He served under Vickers, along with another painter friend of theirs, Herbert Dole, in what might be thought of as the short-lived mosaic picture-making studio for the subway, examples of which can also be seen at the Borough Hall station on the 2 and 3 line and at the Cortlandt Street station on the 1 line (now temporarily closed).“It was not the made-to-order special stuff that the first subway contracts had called for, but for delight in color I personally would choose Vickers,” said Philip Ashforth Coppola, who has been at work for the last 30 years on a series of self-published books about the subway’s design and who, in the mid-1980s, interviewed Ruth Vickers, then elderly, about her father.The exhibition also displays numerous sketches and architectural drawings, brass lamps and wall sconces, Art-Deco-style metal grilles and the occasional wild design indulgence, usually produced for prominent subway entrances, like an elaborate lighted sign flanked by brass seahorses that was installed near the Graybar Building.Quoting from Vickers’s copious writings and displaying several of his colorful, Fauve-ish paintings, the show communicates a strong sense of him as part of a certain turn-of-the-century breed of urban optimist, those who believed that practical know-how, yoked together with art and culture, could solve most of cities’ problems.Few things seemed to be too detailed or petty to draw his attention; he cautioned his builders against using fish glue behind subway tiles because “in warm weather it sometimes oozes out between the tile in black streaks.”And almost nothing passed through his typewriter without picking up a literary allusion or three, from Anatole France to Uncle Tom to the Old Testament. Writing about the noxious waters of the Gowanus Canal, over which an elevated subway line had just been built, he had the prophet Elisha commanding the leper Naaman to “dip thyself seven times in the Gowanus and be clean.” And then he commiserated with leper for not wanting to do so.As the architect of perhaps three quarters of the subway system, Vickers also lived what he preached, taking three forms of public transportation every day from his home in Grand View-on-Hudson in Rockland County to his office in Manhattan: a train to a ferry to a subway. His house and painting studio overlooking the Hudson, an Arts and Crafts cottage that he designed, was one of his life’s other great passions. He called the estate Over Joy, and he painted there prodigiously, often producing canvases of fantastical, almost science-fiction-like city scenes with geometric motifs that echoed the subway’s designs.“My question,” Ms. Amash said, “is when did he have time to paint?”He also wrote Romantic poetry that tended toward the overwrought. (A sample, called “The Sin of Michael Hanlon,” is in the exhibition: “Good Father Burke came through the storm at night to shrive the dying man.”)He decorated the house laboriously over the years with tile work reminiscent of the subway and installed carved and painted masks and designs on walls and fences. Mr. Copolla, who visited Ruth Vickers at the cottage in Grand View-on-Hudson several times before her death in 1990, recalled flourishes like handmade stained-glass lamps and curiosities like a bright blue elephant-head sculpture over a drain spout, so that the water came out through the trunk.“She’d kept it just the way he made it,” Mr. Copolla said of Vickers’s daughter, his only child, a teacher who never married. “It was like a museum to him.”Vickers probably would have liked it that way, if only to serve as an example to others of a life pretty well lived.“If we seek to discriminate,” he wrote once, “if we start out to find that which is best in art, it will permeate the entire life and rule of action. We shall take on larger views and become tolerant, charitable, sympathetic, for we shall have learned that ‘there are more things, Horatio, between heaven and earth than are dreamed of in our philosophy.’ ”'"
"'07-08-03,'0','While consumers continue to express confidence in the outlook for the economy, the government’s monthly employment report, released this morning, added to worries about the spreading impact of the housing slump. The economy added only 92,000 jobs last month, down from 126,000 in June, and the unemployment rate ticked up to 4.6 percent.Mortgage companies have significantly tightened credit lately to borrowers with weak credit histories and are even cracking down on those with solid records who are taking on riskier loans.One large mortgage lender, American Home Mortgage, shut down its lending operation today after banks that had lent it billions of dollars called in their loans because of the declining value of the company’s investments.Earlier this week, the credit worries were so severe that even Countrywide Financial, the nation’s largest mortgage company, felt compelled on Thursday to tell investors that it did not face any difficulties raising money.Lenders say they are increasingly unable to sell home loans that allow borrowers to finance the full or nearly full cost of a property or cannot fully document their incomes. Many companies were writing these loans and selling them to investors just a few weeks ago.“I have never seen it happen so quickly,” said Steve Walsh, a mortgage broker in Scottsdale, Ariz. “Banks always do these little cutbacks here and there. What they are doing now is a liquidity crunch. It’s a credit freeze.”Richard Syron, chief executive of Freddie Mac, the large buyer of mortgages created by Congress in the 1970s, said today that the speed and severity of the tighter credit terms was surprising, but perhaps necessary given the excesses in the market in recent years.In a telephone interview from Washington, he said he was wary of the calls by some mortgage industry officials that Freddie Mac and its cousin Fannie Mae step in to buy loans and securities that private investors will no longer purchase. Mr. Syron noted that his company is operating under an agreement with its regulator that limits the size of its portfolio.“There are some loans that are in difficulty because of liquidity issues — providing more liquidity would help that,” Mr. Syron said. “There are other loans that probably should never have been made and providing more liquidity will make that situation worse in the long term.”The interest rates on many popular mortgages have risen by as much as a full percentage point, if they are available at all, said George J. Jenich, founder of FreeRateSearch.com, a consumer Web site. But rates on conventional fixed-rate 30-year mortgages have held steady.Bear Stearns scheduled its conference call to reassure investors after Standard & Poor’s, one of the agencies that rates the creditworthiness of companies, said it was considering downgrading Bear’s rating because of the collapse of two hedge funds it recently put into bankruptcy after they made losing bets on mortgage securities.Despite all the worries about credit markets, however, the economy continues to plow ahead, and even today’s jobs report was not weak enough to suggest that the Federal Reserve would cut its benchmark short-term interest rate when it meets next week.But the risks to the economy do seem serious enough that investors now expect the Fed to cut its rate to 5 percent, from 5.25 percent, by November, based on the price of a futures contract that is tied to Fed policy. And the yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which moves in the opposite direction from its price, fell to 4.69 percent from 4.77 percent Thursday evening.Wall Street analysts say they are increasingly concerned that consumer spending will weaken as more people in housing and related sectors lose their jobs. They also worry that many homeowners will cut back as they find it harder to refinance or borrow against the value of their homes.“You have a broad-sell off because people don’t know how far the subprime cloud is going to hang over U.S. industries,” said Jake Dollarhide, chief executive of Longbow Asset Management, an investment firm based in Tulsa. “If they don’t get assurance, they are just selling off rather than asking questions.”The S.&P. has fallen 7.7 percent, to 1,433.06, since July 19, the day it established a record. The last two weeks were the worst such period in more than four and a half years, and the broad market index is now up just 1 percent for the year. The Dow is doing somewhat better; it has fallen 5.9 percent, to 13,181.91, since July 19, but it is still up 5.8 percent for the year.And through it all, businesses have been reporting strong earnings. Profits are up 9.6 percent in total for the 80 percent of the companies in the S.&P. index that have released results for the second quarter, noted Douglas M. Peta, chief market strategist at J&W Seligman & Company, an investment firm based in New York.Despite that, Mr. Peta said, he is not particularly optimistic about the near-term outlook for stocks and far less so about the market for debt.“It seems to me things got every bit as silly in the credit markets in the last few years as they did in tech stocks in the late 1990s,” he said. “I still think we may have a ways to go in this.”'"

"'07-08-04,'0','A motherless boy, a graceless dog and a witless script propel “Underdog,” a live-action resurrection of the 1960s television series about a canine superhero who speaks in rhyme while fighting crime. (Sorry, it’s catching.)Ejected from the K-9 unit when he mistakes a leg of pork for a bomb, a chronically inept beagle (voiced by Jason Lee) is adopted by a cop-turned-security guard (Jim Belushi) and his moody son (Alex Neuberger). But after the luckless pooch is grabbed up by a loony scientist (Peter Dinklage) bent on “genetic manipulation,” a lab accident leaves him with more than just the ability to fetch. Now he understands language, aerodynamics and the true purpose of a telephone kiosk.Back in the day, movie mutts were permitted to have adventures and their dignity too. Neither Lassie nor Rin Tin Tin was required to communicate via a computer-generated mouth, and there is something deeply unsettling about Mr. Lee’s voice (which fatally conjures his Southern-fried narration for NBC’s “My Name Is Earl”) emanating from Underdog’s flapping lips. Sharing a major plot point with Todd Holland’s far livelier “Firehouse Dog,” the lackluster story connects the clichés but leaves the characters isolated.“Underdog” may have been originally created to sell cereal for General Mills, but this latest incarnation couldn’t sell Frisbees at a dog park.“Underdog” is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested).

"'07-08-04,'0','The New York Police Department released information last night showing that officers stopped 113,945 people on city streets for the second quarter of this year, a number that a spokesman said was 12.4 percent lower than that recorded in the same period in 2006.The spokesman, Assistant Chief Michael Collins, said the reports were turned over to the City Council yesterday, as required by law.Councilman Peter F. Vallone Jr., chairman of the Council’s Public Safety Committee, said last night that the Council had received the new reports but that he had not had a chance to look at them.The practice of “stop and frisks,” as the street stops are known by police officers, has caused some occasional tension with some city residents. The city has commissioned a study to analyze the stops made in 2006, as well as to interview officers about the decision-making process involved in making the stops.Chief Collins said that the reports showed that 53 percent of the stops in the quarter that ended on June 30 involved blacks, and 67 percent of suspects were described as black by their victims (or by witnesses, for instance, in the case of homicides).'"

"'07-08-04,'0','In recent years, low-cost carriers have spurred an explosion in the number of people flying. While many have welcomed the prices, some now question whether the system grew too big, too quickly, and without adequate investment, overburdening airport infrastructure and overwhelming air traffic controllers.The high costs of long-term solutions are likely to push air travel again beyond the reach of many of Brazil’s 187 million people.The accident on July 17, which killed 199 people, has also deepened one of the worst political crises for President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva since he took office five years ago, adding to a litany of corruption scandals in recent months.There are fears that the economy will suffer, as well. Tourism is already lagging. In addition, the accidents are raising new concerns among international investors about Brazil’s shaky transportation infrastructure.That air travel has come under such scrutiny is particularly difficult to accept here, considering Brazil’s rich aviation tradition. A large country with protected rain forests, it has long relied on air travel to develop its economy and connect its people. The Brazilian hero Alberto Santos-Dumont took one of the first recorded flights in a boxy biplane around Paris in 1906, just three years after the Wright brothers’ historic flight at Kitty Hawk. In more recent times, the Brazilian aircraft manufacturer Embraer has become a major player in the executive jet market.The sprouting of low-cost carriers in recent years — following the American and European models — had been pushing the country’s airline industry forward as well.Airfares have fallen 29 percent since 2001, according to a June report to investors by Gol, a discount entrant that has become Brazil’s version of Southwest Airlines.Passengers like Wellington Souza, 22, a Rio electrician who just began flying this year, have benefited from lower fares and the chance to pay for tickets in installments. Now he and others expect fares to rise along with insurance premiums and other fees for the airlines. TAM, the airline whose plane crashed last month, has reportedly allotted $1.5 billion to compensate victims’ families and for other accident-related costs.Over the past two weeks, the government has focused on de-emphasizing Congonhas airport in São Paulo, where the accident occurred, as a hub for air traffic in the country. Nelson Jobim, whom Mr. da Silva appointed as defense minister after the crash, struck a firm tone on Thursday by insisting that he would not yield to pressure from the airlines to further discuss his decision to reallocate 151 flights that had passed through Congonhas.Mr. da Silva, for his part, has been criticized for being absent from the scene for three days after the accident and for not doing more to reform aviation after an accident in September, when 154 people died in a midair collision of two planes over the Amazon. He said Thursday at a meeting of cabinet ministers and party leaders that he had not been aware of the scale of the aviation problems, comparing it to a cancer that caught him by surprise. “You think everything is O.K., only to discover that the problem is much bigger,” he said.The July disaster occurred as a plane was landing during a rainstorm. It skidded off a short, slippery runway, crashed into an office building and a gas station, and exploded.Days of testimony before a Senate committee investigating the crash have become a blame game for the leaders of two agencies responsible for air travel, who have denied responsibility for reopening the runway at Congonhas before work could be completed to make it less slippery. In the three weeks before the accident, nearly a dozen pilots warned that the landing strip was potentially dangerous, with at least one complaining of hydroplaning.Potential solutions are stark. Building new airports would take years, as would creating a rail link to a lesser-used airport outside of São Paulo. The government has already backed off from a plan to build a new São Paulo airport in favor of a new runway instead.Data recovered from the TAM plane’s flight recorder and the pilots’ cockpit conversation have pointed toward possible pilot error or a mechanical problem with the plane’s spoilers, or air brakes. But both Brazilians and outside experts are wary of conclusions that ignore the structural failings in the aviation system.“Brazilian officials spend more time trying to cover up or hide what is going on than on improving the system,” said Marc Baumgartner, president of the International Federation of Air Traffic Controllers’ Associations in Montreal, which has warned that Brazil’s system is not up to international standards.With air travel in chaos, the stigma attached to lower-priced bus travel is fading fast. Rio’s main intercity bus terminal was overflowing this week, with traffic up 30 percent since mid-July, said Beatriz Lima, the station’s spokeswoman. Some executives have taken their first bus rides in recent days. “It is busier here than at Carnival,” in February or March, typically the high tourist season, she said.Inside the terminal, Sandra Oliveira, 30, waited in line to buy a ticket to Sao Paulo, about six hours away by bus. She stopped flying in March, after waiting for more than seven hours for her flight in Rio, she said. “I said never again, until they figure out this airline chaos.”One of Brazil’s largest companies, Vale do Rio Doce, or CVRD, has employed a new, $7 million Embraer corporate aircraft since September to ensure its employees do not face delays on some routes, said a company spokesman. Other companies are turning to videoconferencing to reduce employee travel.And some visitors are simply canceling their trips. The rap artist Ice-T canceled scheduled performances, citing “aviation chaos,” according to the Brazilian press.Sandra Marques, a hotel owner in Trancoso, a town in Bahia State that is 22 hours by bus from São Paulo, said many Brazilians and Europeans had canceled reservations, a trend that she thought would continue.“Tourists can choose where they go, and they are not going to choose to go to chaos,” she said.'"
"'07-08-04,'0','WASHINGTON, Aug. 3 (AP) — The A.F.L.-C.I.O. has asked the Securities and Exchange Commission to require that the private equity firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Company and the hedge fund Och-Ziff Capital Management Group, both planning public stock offerings, be regulated as investment companies.The companies would have to publicly disclose information about their finances and would be subject to limits on the amount of debt they could assume if they were regulated by the S.E.C. under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as mutual funds are.The S.E.C. is reviewing the plans for initial public stock offerings by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and Och-Ziff, both announced in early July after weeks of drama on Wall Street and in Washington over the $4 billion initial public offering of the private equity firm Blackstone Group. The A.F.L.-C.I.O., which is a major shareholder in public companies, had called on the S.E.C., without success, to delay its approval of the Blackstone offering and require it to be regulated as an investment company.The Blackstone public offering in mid-June, the largest United States offering for a private equity firm and the biggest offering over all in five years, appeared to open the floodgates for other alternative investment funds to go public.In a letter Thursday to the S.E.C., the labor federation said Kravis’s planned $1.25 billion offering and Och-Ziff’s proposed $2 billion offering raised concern because one of the companies owned by Kravis holds $11.9 billion in mortgage-backed securities, while Och-Ziff’s offering would indirectly sell unregulated hedge funds to the public.'"
"'07-08-04,'0','Brown stunned the crowd again several minutes later by walking off the ramp with assistance. By Friday morning, as he lay in an area hospital bed preparing to be discharged, footage of his disturbing fall was being replayed widely on television and computer screens.The X Games, which continue through Sunday in Los Angeles and in Carson, Calif., went on as usual. In the spirit of these sports, no one advocated limits that might prevent serious injury to the athletes. ESPN received widespread coverage because of the fall, which also gave Brown and his sponsors publicity.All of which raises the question: In action sports, where there are no widely recognized governing bodies or organized control, who decides what is an acceptable level of risk?“I think the athletes are the ones that first establish the level of risk that they are most comfortable with,” said Chris Stiepock, general manager for the X Games. “If ESPN was not pointing cameras at them, these athletes would still be doing what they’re doing.”But when the cameras are on, athletes are not rewarded for restraint, so they will go for bigger tricks with higher risks.At the time of his fall, Brown was in first place, but on his final run he attempted a 720 — two full rotations — over the ramp’s 70-foot gap, a move no one had ever landed in Big Air competition. Although he landed it, Brown was not prepared for the 27-foot-tall quarterpipe that followed.He readied for a McTwist — a 540-degree spin — but lost control as he approached the lip of the ramp.He said he felt as though he was “shot out of a cannon” as his momentum carried him away from the ramp’s wall and out over its flat section. He fell about 45 feet, his limbs flailing, and landed on his feet with such force that both his sneakers shot off. He was then thrown hard onto his back, his helmet striking the wooden base of the ramp.Brown spent Thursday night in a local hospital, where he was treated for a bleeding liver, two sprained wrists, a bruised lung, and whiplash to his back and neck.Dulled by painkillers and speaking from his room Friday, he said of his fall, “I think that was kind of the highlight.”Brown wound up finishing second after Burnquist followed his fall with the event’s winning run. But Brown welcomed his newfound fame.“If that’s what it takes to get attention,” he said, adding, “It’s not what I set out to do, you know.”He considered himself lucky not to have more serious injuries.His fall reminded many of Stephen Murray, a BMX freestyle rider who had won a gold medal at the X Games. Murray was paralyzed from the neck down in June while competing at NBC’s Dew Action Sports Tour’s Panasonic Open in Baltimore.Murray attempted a double back flip when he became disconnected from his bike in midair and fell 10 feet onto his head.In the meantime, action sports have become more advanced and dangerous.Danny Way built and rode the first Mega Ramp in 2002, and brought the Big Air discipline to the X Games in 2004. He has won a gold medal in the event three times. He did not compete because of a knee injury.“That was by far the gnarliest slam on the Mega Ramp that has taken place to this stage,” Way, 33, said about Brown.In the freestyle motocross best trick event later Thursday, some riders braced for another serious crash.The X Games invited Scott Murray, a relatively unknown 30-year-old from Michigan who had never competed in freestyle motocross, to compete in the event after seeing video of him landing a double back flip on his motorcycle.The decorated freestyle rider Travis Pastrana pulled the sport’s first double back flip during the X Games last year. But Pastrana has retired, and other riders have vowed not to try the move because of the danger involved.Murray attempted the flip Thursday and fell, but was not injured.Kevin Robinson defended his gold medal in BMX freestyle Big Air at the Staples Center on Friday night on the Mega Ramp. On his fourth run, Robinson pulled a no-handed back flip over the ramp’s 70-foot gap and launched a flair 18 feet above the 27-foot quarterpipe. His winning score was 95.33. Steve McCann finished second with a 93, and Anthony Napolitan was third with a 92.66.'"
"'07-08-04,'0','LONDON, Aug. 3 (Reuters) — Foot-and-mouth disease has been found in cattle on a farm in Guildford, near Surrey, England, the British government said Friday as it shut down livestock movements to stop a repeat of a 2001 outbreak that led to the burning of nearly four million sheep, pigs and cows.The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said that the movement of livestock had been banned nationwide and that a six-mile surveillance zone had been placed around the farm. All cattle on the farm will be killed. The highly contagious disease causes high fevers and blisters in cloven-hoofed animals and can often lead to death. It is rarely contracted by people.Prime Minister Gordon Brown took part by telephone in an emergency meeting of officials on Friday from southern England, where he had begun a vacation. He will return to London on Saturday. “Our top priority is to prevent the spread of this disease,” a spokeswoman said.The National Farmers’ Union said it welcomed the blanket ban on the movement of livestock. “We believe that this is the right response to this incident and it is vital that we do everything possible to stop the spread of this disease quickly,” it said in a statement.Britain was the center of a major outbreak that began in 2001 in an abattoir in southern England and spread to several other European countries before it was eradicated. The outbreak turned into one of the world’s largest and most expensive animal disease epidemics, with overall costs estimated at up to $16 billion.The outbreak ravaged Britain, where authorities slaughtered 6.5 million animals and burned them on giant pyres to stem the spread of the disease.'"
"'07-08-04,'0','Those who talk the most on the phone are ages 18 to 24, according to a study of cellphone use by Telephia Inc., a San Francisco research firm that follows cellphone trends. In the first quarter of 2007, this group sent and received on average 290 calls a month, the study found. Text messaging was highest, Telephia said, among 13- to 17-year-olds, who averaged 435 messages a month.By contrast, cellphone users 45 to 54 years old spoke on the phone 194 times, on average, a month and sent only 57 text messages.David S. Hachen, an associate professor of sociology at the University of Notre Dame who looked at cellphone use and its effects on people’s relationships, said he had found that cellphone networks tend to be a reflection of friendship networks.“Friendship networks,” he said, “tend to be larger in younger groups, but they have weaker ties with those they talk with. But as they get older, the networks are smaller and they have stronger ties.”Some experts worry that cellphones will replace face-to-face contact, said Scott Campbell, who teaches communication studies at the University of Michigan.But after he conducted research on the impact of cellphones on social networks, Mr. Campbell said he concluded that cellphones actually enhanced the bonds between users.“Who young people talk to says something symbolically about who they are tied to,” Mr. Campbell said in an interview. “And who they are talking to the most are their close friends.”Rich Ling, a sociologist at Telenor’s communication research institute in Norway, who wrote a book on cellphone use called “The Mobile Connection: The Cellphone’s Impact on Society,” added that cellphones blur the lines of when an encounter starts and when it ends.“Young people are not just talking for two hours, but they are continually connecting through the day,” he said. He cited the young couple who send text messages and call each other all day to set up details of a date. “When does the date start, or does it start when they are sending messages back and forth?”Mr. Campbell describes text messaging as the equivalent of passing notes in class, though they are more fragmentary and more frequent.“A lot of people think these messages are meaningless, but they are actually symbolic gestures of friendship,” he said.Unlike traditional landline telephones, which once made callers distinguish between local and long distance, cellphone carriers divide the world into in-network and outside. And because basic plans from the three major cellphone carriers, Verizon, Sprint and AT&T, are all about the same price — under $60 a month — the deciding factor for young people, in particular, is what network friends are on.Carriers are giving customers more options to stay connected with people outside their network. This year, T-Mobile introduced a plan that allows customers to choose five telephone numbers outside its network that they can call free at any time. Sprint offers night minutes that start at 7 p.m., two hours earlier than competitors.“We are trying to avoid restricting customers to just people on their network,” said a Sprint spokeswoman, Emmy Anderson.But while these plans may allow callers to talk free, the person receiving the call is still using daytime minutes.Steve Bufford, 24, of Manhattan, said he constantly monitored his out-of-network minutes. And he had to cut back on conversations with a few of his friends — “until the weekends, then we become the best of friends in the world,” he said.As for Ms. McDowell and Ms. Chandler, the two who rarely talk on the phone now, they say they visit each other more.“We used to talk every day all day,” said Ms. McDowell, a 21-year-old student at Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis. “Now I only hear from her after 9 p.m. so she doesn’t use her minutes.”In the cellphone world, minutes mean money, a lesson young adults say they quickly learn when they move off the family plans and sign their own contracts. While they once talked freely when their parents paid the bill, they become penny pinchers when they have to pay their own way.Elisa Joris, 23, of Walled Lake, Mich., said that was exactly what happened to her. She became a Sprint customer in high school when her mother added her to the family plan. Now, seven years later, she stays with the carrier because the people she talks to the most — her brother, her former boyfriend and best friends — are all on the network.Ms. Joris said that because she no longer shared minutes with her parents, she signed up for the plan with the lowest cost even though it had the fewest minutes. For $30 a month, she gets 300 daytime minutes, but it is the free calling within the network that makes the plan a real bargain.In June, she used only 200 of those peak-hour minutes. But, she said, she spent more than 800 minutes on the phone with other Sprint customers.“I have seen bills where I have used 1,500 minutes,” she said. “I try not to talk to those who don’t have Sprint. I don’t have minutes to waste.”And while her attitude has yet to affect her relationships in a negative way, Ms. Joris said it had brought her closer to someone she now considered a friend who might have been an acquaintance if she were on another network.“One reason she talks to me more than her other friends is because we both have Sprint,” she said.Some cellphone users say they have found a way to change carriers without losing touch with friends. As they switch to new companies, they try to encourage their friends to move with them.Ms. McDowell said she followed her friends as they hopped around.In high school, she said, all her friends had the T-Mobile Sidekick — the sleek, palm-size phone with a full keypad. So she signed a two-year contract with the cellphone provider so she could send them text messages at no cost.Then in college, she said she and her friends switched to Nextel so they could “chirp” to each other on their walkie-talkie phones.Last month, she returned to T-Mobile after everybody in her circle migrated back for the new Sidekick 3.Her friend, Ms. Chandler, got lost after the second move. She still has Sprint, now part of Sprint Nextel, but she said she planned to leave once her contract expired. Ms. McDowell persuaded her to move to T-Mobile.“As soon as I can, I am on my way,” Ms. Chandler said.'"
"'07-08-04,'0','ST. ANDREWS, Scotland, Aug. 3 — Before the Women’s British Open, it was easy to overlook the best title prospect from Britain, Catriona Matthew.At 5 feet 4 inches, Matthew is not as physically imposing as the Englishwoman Laura Davies, nor does she possess Davies’s large personality. Because her sound bites tend to be as thin as she is, Matthew doesn’t usually take up a lot of space in the British tabloids.But Matthew, a soft-spoken Scot, became impossible to ignore Friday. After opening with an even-par 73, she carded a second-round 68 on the Old Course to move into a tie for second with Wendy Ward at five under, one stroke behind Lorena Ochoa. Davies, meanwhile, was one stroke above the projected cut of five over.Matthew, who grew up in nearby North Berwick, learned the game on links courses. She is a two-time winner of the St. Rule Trophy, a woman’s amateur event played on the Old and New Courses. And yet she had reasons other than modesty to sidestep any talk of contending this week.Since taking third at the 2001 Women’s British Open, Matthew has not finished higher than 21st in the event. She missed the cut in two of the previous four years.'"
"'07-08-04,'0','The stock market’s volatility is making portfolio managers nervous, but it is not making them sell, many say. Instead, their response to the cascade from record highs has been to ensure that they own shares of businesses less sensitive than most to changes in economic conditions or to the whims of investment fashion.Even if the economy slows markedly or financing dries up for private equity and hedge funds — two key suspects in the recent decline — certain categories of stocks are expected to outperform the market. These are stable-growth companies whose business is necessities or cheap, desirable basics, like food and drinks, health care, clothing, leisure and entertainment. Their earnings tend to be consistent no matter how the economy is doing, and they have been almost ignored by private equity and hedge fund managers.When mutual fund managers are asked to name stocks that they are most comfortable clinging to in turbulent market conditions, these are the industries they cite.Randall Haase, manager of the Baron Fifth Avenue Growth fund, says he has an “ultra-high focus on quality” that steers him toward stable growth companies. He especially likes businesses that are taking market share from their peers and are involved in industries that are growing ahead of the curve.“If I’m in a canoe, I want to have the current with me, not against me,” he said.His first choice is the British company Diageo. It is the world’s largest seller of spirits, through such brands as Smirnoff, Jose Cuervo, J & B and Guinness. That business is booming as younger drinkers graduate from beer to mixed drinks, Mr. Haase said.'"
"'07-08-04,'0','SALES of high-end art, jewelry and wine are booming. Stocks, until recently, were hitting new highs, and consumer confidence and spending are solid.That could only mean one thing: the stock market bubble is about to burst.That is at least one plausible conclusion, James B. Stewart writes in Smart Money.“Far be it from me to dampen the party, but why do I feel as though I’ve lived through this before? Maybe it’s because I have — in the late 1980s and then again the late 1990s. Indeed, 2007 feels much the same as 1987 and 1999 did.”Mr. Stewart is not saying that a 1987-style stock market crash is on the immediate horizon, and he concedes that “by many measures, stocks aren’t overpriced, even at recent highs.” For example, when the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index reached its previous high in 2000, shares were trading at nearly 26 times earnings. When it reached a new high in June, shares were trading at less than 16 times earnings.“And yet I have learned over the years that nothing rises forever, and that the longer this goes on, the more severe will be any correction.”'"
"'07-08-04,'0','Steven A. Shaw’s analysis of the danger of the efforts to eliminate all risks in pregnancy, “no matter how infinitesimal,” applies to more than just eating fish.We live in a society where pregnant women are encouraged to be afraid (be very afraid), the ironic result of which is to increase risk to moms and babies. The surgical birth (Caesarean) rate in the United States is now well over 30 percent, a result of the reasonable desire of physicians and women to plan a risk-free birth.But as with the avoidance of fish, where pregnant women are losing the benefits of fatty acids for their babies’ development, the choice of surgical rather than vaginal birth actually increases risks for babies (higher rates of respiratory difficulties) and mothers (higher rates of placental problems, hemorrhage and infection).Surgical birth can be a lifesaving procedure, but in Mr. Shaw’s words, it is “twisted logic” to sell surgery as a panacea for pregnant women looking for a “perfect” birth.Raymond De Vries Charlotte De VriesAnn Arbor, Mich., July 15, 2007The writers are, respectively, a past president of Lamaze International and the co-author of “The Official Lamaze Guide: Giving Birth With Confidence.”'"
"'07-08-04,'0','“And the Band Stayed On,” by Erwin R. Tiongson (Op-Ed, Aug. 2), reminded me of the time when my husband’s wedding band was stolen from his locker at the club he used to exercise. We went to buy a replacement and were taken by surprise when the salesperson asked us, “Only one?”Forty one years later and two more replacements, the band stays on.Erwin Tiongson’s poignant reflection on the temporary loss of a wedding ring as a prequel for final loss brought to mind my father-in-law’s response to the recent death of his wife.Her fingers had become so crippled by arthritis that before her last hospitalization the band symbolizing their partnership had to be surgically removed. When she died, quietly and with him holding her hand, as he had done so often during their 65 years together, he replaced the ring with a simpler band. He then had her original ring resized, so that he could wear it.Wearing her ring has done little to lessen his sorrow. But it seems to have made the experience of loss a chapter in their love rather than its end.'"
"'07-08-04,'0','MINNEAPOLIS, Aug. 3 — They are the missing, the unrecovered.The Somali refugee, five months pregnant, driving across the river with her toddler daughter in the back seat.The red-haired construction worker, the only member of the crew repairing the bridge who has not been found, a jovial man operating a skid loader that plunged suddenly into the water.Two days after the Interstate 35W bridge crumpled into the Mississipi River, injuring about 100 and killing at least five, the families of those who are still lost are facing an agonizing limbo.As divers search the river in an effort that officials say could take days or weeks — hampered by treacherous currents, murky water and dangerous wreckage — the families do not know when, or even if, their loved ones will be found.“We’re just on a waiting game,” said Dorothy Svendsen, 65, the mother of the construction worker, Gregory Jolstad, who could not bring herself to come to Minneapolis from her home two hours away in Hinckley. At least in her own house, she said, friends can help her through the gruelingly wait for the inevitable.“I am resigned to the fact that he must have drowned, and that they will recover him as soon as they can get there safely,” Ms. Svendsen said. “I don’t want them going in after him if somebody else is going to get hurt doing it.”She breathed softly and said, “But it’s very hard.”The family of Sadiya Sahal, the pregnant, 23-year-old Somali nursing student, is “devastated,” said Omar Jamal, a leader of Somalis here who is acting as spokesman for the family.Mr. Jamal said Ms. Sahal was known in the large Somali community here as vivacious and social, striving to raise her growing family. He said that Wednesday’s accident had unsettled many Somali families.“The bridge that collapsed is in the center of the Somali community, on both sides of the river,” Mr. Jamal said. “There were a couple of Somalis injured, who are in the hospital. There were two or three Somali kids on the school bus” that fell 60 feet and managed to land upright, allowing all its passengers to survive.Those families who know their loved ones are dead were taking cold comfort in that certainty.“To me this is not a disaster, this is a murder — because people knew the bridge was unstable,” said Khaffak Ansari, whose former wife, Julia Blackhawk, 32, died in the collapse. “This is not just a person. This is the dreams of a human being.”Mr. Ansari, 42, an Iraqi native who has been in this country for 22 years, said his relatives in Iraq had telephoned him and said: “We expect things like that to happen here, not over there. Bridges are not supposed to fall down in America.”Moments of Ms. Blackhawk’s life sprang to Mr. Ansari’s mind like jewels just out of reach.How “she gave me this very goofy haircut” in her cosmetology class. How she was so proud of being a Winnebago Indian that she adopted a traditional Winnebago name.And how she weathered her parents’ divorce and being raised by a grandfather, who died when she was still a child.Ms. Blackhawk, like many of those missing or dead, had children at home, in her case two sons.Artemio Trinidad Mena, a 29-year-old salesman for a distributor of vegetables, rice and other items, left behind four children, ages 11 years to 2 months — the three oldest living with relatives in his native Mexico, the youngest at home in Minneapolis with his wife, Abundia Martínez.Mr. Trinidad Mena’s boss, Julio Alvarado, said his employee was always joking and friendly.With a cardboard box set out on a makeshift shrine on the sidewalk outside his business, Mr. Alvarado is helping Ms. Martínez raise money to support their children and to return her husband’s body to Mexico.Jennifer Holmes, whose husband, Patrick Holmes, 36, an exercise therapist, died as he was commuting home, is faced with explaining his absence to their 4-year-old daughter and 6-year-old son. Mr. Holmes, who coached his son’s baseball and soccer teams, spent “a ton of time” with the children, Ms. Holmes said.“They don’t quite understand it yet,” said Ms. Holmes, 35, a special-education teacher. “I wanted to spend the rest of my life with him. But right now I need to be supportive to my children and get us all through this.”Late Friday, the authorities identified the fifth fatality as Paul Eickstadt, 51, of Mounds View, Minn. Mr. Eickstadt, a truck driver for the former Taystee bakery in Roseville, Minn., now owned by the Sara Lee Corporation, had just started out on his shift, bound for Iowa with bread, buns and rolls.His truck was engulfed in flames in a chilling image seen on live broadcasts across the country.“We learned of our truck’s involvement as the nation was watching in horror,” said Mark Goldman, a Sara Lee spokesman.'"
"'07-08-04,'0','While consumers continue to express confidence in the outlook for the economy, the government’s monthly employment report, released yesterday morning, added to worries about the spreading impact of the housing slump. The economy added only 92,000 jobs last month, down from 126,000 in June and the unemployment rate ticked up to 4.6 percent.Mortgage companies have significantly tightened credit lately to borrowers with weak credit histories and are even cracking down on those with solid records who are taking on riskier loans.On Thursday, the credit worries were so severe that even Countrywide Financial, the nation’s largest mortgage company, felt compelled to tell investors that it did not face any difficulties raising money.Lenders say they are increasingly unable to persuade investors to buy packages of home loans made to borrowers with little or no down payment or those who cannot fully document their incomes. As a result, many companies are no longer offering such loans to potential buyers.“I have never seen it happen so quickly,” said Steve Walsh, a mortgage broker in Scottsdale, Ariz. “Banks always do these little cutbacks here and there. What they are doing now is a liquidity crunch. It’s a credit freeze.”Richard F. Syron, chief executive of Freddie Mac, the large buyer of mortgages created by Congress in the 1970s, said yesterday that the speed and severity of the tighter credit terms are surprising, but perhaps necessary given the excesses in the market in recent years.In a telephone interview from Washington, he was wary of the calls by some mortgage industry officials that Freddie Mac and its cousin, Fannie Mae, step in to buy loans and securities that private investors will no longer purchase. Mr. Syron noted that his company was operating under an agreement with its regulator that limited the size of its portfolio.“There are some loans that are in difficulty” because credit pools are drying up, Mr. Syron said. “There are other loans that probably should never have been made and providing more liquidity will make that situation worse in the long term.”The interest rates on many popular mortgages have risen by as much as a full percentage point, if they are available at all, said George J. Jenich, founder of FreeRateSearch.com, a consumer Web site. But rates on conventional fixed-rate 30-year mortgages have held steady.Bear Stearns scheduled its conference call to reassure investors after Standard & Poor’s, one of the agencies that rates the creditworthiness of companies, said it was considering downgrading Bear’s credit rating because of the collapse of two hedge funds it recently put into bankruptcy after they made losing bets on mortgage securities.Despite all the worries about credit markets, however, the economy continues to plow ahead and even yesterday’s jobs report was not weak enough to suggest that the Federal Reserve would cut its benchmark short-term interest rate when it meets next week.But the risks to the economy do seem serious enough that investors now expect the Fed to cut its rate to 5 percent, from 5.25 percent by November, based on the price of a trading instrument that is tied to Fed policy. And the yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 4.68 percent from 4.77 percent Thursday evening.Wall Street analysts say they are increasingly concerned that consumer spending will weaken as more people in housing and related sectors lose their jobs. They also worry that many homeowners will cut back as they find it harder to refinance or borrow against the value of their homes.“You have a broad sell-off because people don’t know how far the subprime cloud is going to hang over U.S. industries,” said Jake Dollarhide, chief executive of Longbow Asset Management, an investment firm based in Tulsa, Okla. “If they don’t get assurance, they are just selling off rather than asking questions.”The S.& P. has fallen 7.7 percent, to 1,433.06, since July 19, the day it established a record. The last two weeks were the worst such period in more than four and a half years, and the broad market index is now up just 1 percent for the year. The Dow is doing somewhat better; it has fallen 5.9 percent, to 13,181.91, since July 19, but it is still up 5.8 percent for the year.And through it all, businesses have been reporting strong earnings. Profits are up 9.6 percent in total for the 80 percent of the companies in the S.& P. index that have released results for the second quarter, noted Douglas M. Peta, chief market strategist at J. & W. Seligman & Company, an investment firm based in New York.Despite that, Mr. Peta said, he was not particularly optimistic about the near-term outlook for stocks and far less so about the market for debt.“It seems to me things got every bit as silly in the credit markets in the last few years as they did in tech stocks in the late 1990s,” he said. “I still think we may have a ways to go in this.”'"

Betty Thompson, an American military spokeswoman, said that he was killed Thursday and that his body “was positively identified by close associates and family members.”An Iraqi security official in Samarra said that Mr. Badri was killed by a strike on his house in Al Jilam village, six miles from Samarra.The official said that Mr. Badri’s father was arrested by the Americans and that during the operation followers of Mr. Badri, who are predominantly Arabs, fought with United States troops.'"

It also appointed new leaders of the navy and air force.The Turkish general staff said on its Web site that the 23 had been involved in “reactionary activities” and “acts prejudicial to the discipline and prestige of the armed forces.”The army considers itself guardian of the secular tradition established by Turkey’s founder, Mustafa Kemal Ataturk. It has taken over the government for various periods, and in recent years has fired dozens of men suspected of Islamic militancy.Mr. Erdogan’s Justice and Development Party, which has Islamic roots, clashed in April with the army, which threatened earlier this year to intervene over the election of a president. Last month, his party won a larger than expected victory in nationwide parliamentary elections, taking close to half the total vote.On Saturday, the new Parliament was sworn in and held its first session here in the capital.

He was going through the motions. He dreamed of quitting.The difference, though, was that leaving his job as a top engineer at eBay would mean saying goodbye not only to a handsome six-figure salary, but also the additional $25,000 he earned each month as his eBay stock options vested.In 2002, eBay bought PayPal, the company where Mr. McClure worked as marketing director. He continued working at eBay long enough to see the shares he earned as a PayPal executive fully vest — roughly $1 million — but he decided to leave eBay shortly after that, in October 2004.Mr. McClure walked away from $200,000 or more in stock options, he said.Tales like Mr. McClure’s are common. Tony Barbagallo, for instance, a marketing executive who has worked in the technology sector for two decades, estimated that he walked away from $800,000 in stock and options when he left Microsoft in June 2000 (after earning $3.2 million in stock and options, before taxes).Mr. Barbagallo also left a larger company because he sought to return to the start-up world, a place that enriched him by $250,000 for four years of work, in addition to his regular salary.'"
"'07-08-05,'0','The flooding has presented the country’s army-backed caretaker government, which took power in January, with its latest and perhaps toughest challenge. Its impact has been felt far beyond the flood-affected districts. Prices of essential commodities, including food, have spiked in recent weeks because flooded roads have disrupted transportation. The government sought this week to dispel public anxiety over food shortages, saying that it was ready to bring food from abroad. As in all floods every year, nature shared blame with human negligence. A 600-mile flood protection dam was badly damaged this year.In Nepal, unremitting rains for the last two weeks flooded swaths of the heavily populated southern plains, known as the Terai Region, on the border with India. The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs estimated that up to 300,000 people were in need of water, food and other basic supplies.Nearly 10,000 people were displaced, and 84 had been killed, said Paul Handley, a field coordinator with the agency. He added that the full scale of damage could be ascertained only in the coming days to determine how much agricultural land had been ruined and how many buildings destroyed.Nepal, too, is accustomed to floods each year. But the unusually heavy rains this year seem to have affected more of the country, and with rainwater pooling up and refusing to recede, fragile mud buildings are threatened, and the likelihood of an outbreak of water-borne diseases like diarrhea also increases.The United Nations and aid agencies in Nepal have already nearly exhausted their supplies of food and other goods, Mr. Handley said, although the monsoon season is not expected to end for at least another month.In India, the monsoon’s trail of destruction traveled to the north and northeast last week. The death toll since the start of the monsoon in June stood at 1,225, according to the Home Ministry.The military was deployed to the worst affected states, including Assam, Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, where more than 12 million people have been affected by flooding over the last week. The Indian Air Force air-dropped food packets to displaced people in Bihar on Saturday, where 70,000 houses were damaged, according to the Press Trust of India,Pakistan has already had its turn with flooding. In July rains in Baluchistan and Sindh provinces, the death toll reached 329 and 90,000 families were made homeless, the United Nations said.'"

On Saturday, they were able to hoist from the river a badly crushed car, Sheriff Rich Stanek said. So far, he said, divers have checked out nine cars in the river, and they have been able to account for the people who were driving eight of those cars, some of whom survived the accident. They have not been able to match the car removed from the river Saturday with its driver, he said.Also on Saturday, President Bush surveyed the pancaked concrete, contorted steel and hulks of half-sunken cars on a visit to the bridge.Expressing condolences to the families of the victims and “prayers to those who wonder about whether they’ll ever see a loved one again,” the president promised to make it a priority to rebuild the bridge “in a way that not only expedites the flow of traffic but in a way that can stand the test of time.”Mr. Bush took a 10-minute helicopter tour of the wreckage, where he could see the remains of a school bus, a truck and other vehicles. In a light rain, divers continued the painstaking search for the bodies of the eight people believed to be missing. Five people were confirmed dead in the accident and about 100 were injured.“Our message to the Twin Cities is we want to get this bridge rebuilt as quick as possible,” the president said. “We understand this is a main artery of life here, that people count on this bridge, this highway system, to get to work.”The federal government has already pledged $5 million to help remove debris and to reroute traffic around the collapsed bridge. And the House has approved $250 million to help rebuild the bridge.Mary E. Peters, the secretary of transportation, traveled with the president on Saturday and said that she had asked the inspector general of her department to join in the investigation of the bridge collapse. The National Transportation Safety Board is already involved in the search for answers.'"
"'07-08-05,'0','“As a team, we’re going in with a lot of confidence,” Earnhardt said. “The Bud team is performing really well, but we just seem to run into things beyond our control. It’s not like we’ve been struggling; we’ve been running up front and in contention to win.“It feels like a huge jigsaw puzzle. We have it 99 percent complete and it looks beautiful — and then the final piece is missing, somehow. If we find that last piece and we don’t get hit by something falling out of the sky, we’re going to be all right.”In an interview last week on Sirius Satellite Radio, Earnhardt said he was disappointed to be on the cusp of not making the Chase.“We’re better than that,” he said. “We’re really, really good and we’re just not able to show it with our stats. Our finishes are not indicative of how the cars ran. We’ve run up front at most of the races and we’ve led some races. We’ve been competitive every week. We’re running up front at Vegasm and I pitted and sped down pit road, and we lost all those spots. We blew two motors early in the year,” and broke the motor at Indy.“We’ve had a lot of just bad luck and bad decisions that have cost us lots of points,” he added. “We’ve cost ourselves I think around 400 points.”But asked if he had any doubts that he would make the Chase, Earnhardt, who will leave D.E.I. for Hendrick Motorsports at the end of this season, said, “No doubt.”CREW CHIEF LIFTS BUSCH Since Pat Tryson joined Penske Racing five races ago as the crew chief for Kurt Busch, he has bulled his way into the battle for the Chase.Before Tryson left his job as the crew chief for Greg Biffle at Roush Fenway Racing, Busch was languishing in 16th place, 144 points behind 12th-place Dale Earnhardt Jr.Busch and Tryson are hoping for a better day at Pocono than Busch had in June when he crashed in practice, switched to his brand-new backup car for qualifying and wound up 16th in the race.Of Busch’s 15 career victories, a third of them have come on flat tracks. He has won twice at New Hampshire and once at Phoenix, Martinsville and Pocono. Entering today’s race, Busch has four second-place finishes at Pocono.“Kurt is one of the best flat-track racers in our sport, and we’re superexcited to be headed back to another flat track this weekend,” Tryson said. “He’s dominated races at Loudon. He’s won at Phoenix. He probably could have won another four or five races at Pocono already. He has such great finesse on these tracks when he has good cars under him.”SUPERCHARGED SUMMER Tony Stewart, the two-time Cup champion, has apparently begun his usual second-half charge, but he seems at a loss to explain why it usually takes him the entire first half of the season to get it going.“This time of year, it seems like we get hot,” said Stewart, who heads for Pocono with two straight victories — his first of 2007. “We’ve even tried to sit down and figure out what we’re missing in the spring, why we can’t do then what we’re typically able to do now.”“It just seems like when the tracks gets hot and slippery that it suits my driving style and the setups Zippy puts on the car,” he added, referring to his crew chief, Greg Zipadelli.Now that he is heating up, should Stewart be considered the favorite to win another title?“There’s still a lot of racing to go,” he said. “There are no guarantees. But I do feel like we’re doing what we need to do to put ourselves in championship contention. And like I’ve always said, you go out and try to win races and the points take care of themselves. It’s what we’ve been trying to do all year, and it’s paying off now.”'"
"'07-08-05,'0','For instance, over the last half-century, the worst one-year stretch for a portfolio of 60 percent stocks, 30 percent bonds and 10 percent cash was a loss of 24.1 percent. That occurred in the 12 months that ended in September 1974.By comparison, the worst one-year loss for a more conservative mix — 40 percent stocks, 40 percent bonds and 20 percent cash — was just 15.5 percent during the same period.Yet to achieve this lower risk, you would have to give up a decent amount of gains. In this case, the switch in asset allocation strategy would have reduced your average annual returns to 8.3 percent from 9.2 percent.For some investors, that may be too significant a loss of potential returns to consider.So the asset manager T. Rowe Price recently posed a different question. Can you significantly reduce your exposure to risk simply by rebalancing your portfolio once a year, rather than permanently reducing your exposure to stocks for the long run?The answer turns out to be yes.Say you started investing at the end of 1984, in a portfolio consisting of 60 percent stocks, 30 percent bonds and 10 percent cash. And further assume that you never rebalanced this portfolio back to that 60-30-10 ratio. Instead, you did what a surprisingly large percentage of individual investors do: you let the market take your investments for a ride.Through the end of June, this strategy would have earned an average annual gain of 11.1 percent since 1984. Now, had you started in 1984 with the same strategy, but this time rebalanced your portfolio annually, you would have earned nearly as much on your investments: 10.7 percent a year, on average.But at the same time, that portfolio would have been 18 percent less volatile, based on standard deviation, according to T. Rowe Price. The buffering effect of rebalancing might have been enough to let you sleep better at night.Unfortunately, a vast majority of individual investors fail to take that simple step. According to a new study by Hewitt Associates, the employee benefit research firm in Lincolnshire, Ill., only 18 percent of workers who invested in a 401(k) retirement plan rebalanced their portfolios last year.This is about in line with historical trends, as only 17 percent of 401(k) investors rebalanced their accounts in 2005 as well as in 2004, according to Hewitt.The fact is, whether or not you tweak your mix of stocks and bonds, the market will do it for you — though maybe in a way you won’t like.Over the long term, stocks — which are much riskier than bonds — tend to outperform bonds. So “if you rely on inertia and don’t rebalance regularly, over the long run, you’re going to end up with a bigger allocation to stocks than you started with,” said Christine Fahlund, senior financial planner at T. Rowe Price in Baltimore.But rebalancing is not just about resetting your mix of stocks and bonds. You should also consider periodically resetting the types of stocks you own.For instance, Mr. Stovall notes that over the last five years, many of the best-performing areas of the stock market have also been among the most volatile.Those include the basic materials, telecommunications and technology sectors, all of which have a “beta” of more than 1.0. (Beta measures the tendency of an investment to go up or down, relative to the market — in this case the S.& P. 500-stock index. So a beta of more than 1 implies that if the S.& P. 500 were to rise or fall 5 percent, for example, that investment would rise or fall even further.)On the other hand, two of the lowest beta sectors in the market — health care stocks, with a beta of 0.6, and consumer staples stocks, at 0.5 — have been the market’s worst performers over the past five years.One way that investors might consider rebalancing the stock portion of their portfolios is to “gravitate toward areas with lower volatility, like health care and consumer staples, while avoiding those highly volatile areas that have already done exceptionally well,” Mr. Stovall said.JEFFREY N. KLEINTOP, chief market strategist at LPL Financial Services in Boston, said that another way to rebalance — without selling any holdings — is simply to take your new money and invest it in areas that many investors have ignored in recent years, like large-capitalization domestic growth stocks and stock funds. These may be worth buying now.While many people associate large-cap growth stocks with technology, these equities can also be found in the health care and industrial sectors, both of which have a beta of less than 1.The notion of buying stocks amid a market storm may seem unappetizing. And some investors may decide simply to wait to see whether this is a short-term sell-off or the start of a real correction.But keep in mind that if you have not rebalanced your portfolio for several years, chances are that you probably have more equity exposure than you intend. Moreover, you are probably overexposed to the most volatile types of stocks. So some rebalancing may be better than no action at all.'"
"'07-08-05,'0','The surveys show that while 45 percent of women who take an off-ramp from their careers face child-care challenges and another 24 percent have elder-care duties, almost one-third take a break solely because their partner’s income is enough to support the household. Women use the off-ramp because they can.These women still value the pressures and rewards of success, even if they do not value them exclusively. Their challenge becomes how to find an on-ramp back to the corporate world.Dr. Hewlett brings to bear a great deal of evidence to support her contention that professional women are held back by an outdated career model designed for white men with wives at home.Her calls for a rethinking have gained an audience in the corner office. White men are “a segment of the talent pool that is shrinking,” Jeremy Isaacs, chief executive for Europe and Asia at Lehman Brothers, tells her. In fact, the number of men with graduate degrees is projected to grow by just 1.3 percent over the next decade, compared with 16 percent for women, according to the Education Department. Small wonder that Mr. Isaacs says he “would absolutely take three days a week of someone who is truly talented.”For an employer to allow flexibility, in other words, is not a luxury; it is necessary for marketplace survival.Written as both advocacy and practical guide, the book offers suggestions to employers: establish a rich menu of flexible work and career arrangements, reimagine work-life issues (for example, offer benefits for elder care and not just child care), help women claim ambition, harness altruism and reduce stigma (even when flexible policies are in place, women do not always exercise them for fear of ending up on the mommy track).Chapter after chapter illustrates how companies like Ernst & Young, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, Time Warner, Johnson & Johnson and American Express are experimenting with these approaches. And through Dr. Hewlett’s cross-company task force, they are sharing their successes. There’s movement.No data are furnished on nonprofessional female workers or on how professional women treat their own employees, including nannies and housekeepers, many of whom would like flexible schedules — not to mention working from home.Upbeat and earnest, Dr. Hewlett does manage some entertaining interludes, including the chapter on “extreme jobs” created by technology creep. Today, managers thumb their BlackBerrys to dispatch half-baked demands instantly and relentlessly. Extreme workers turn out to be predominantly men, leading sleepless, furniture-less lives — and loving it.Dr. Hewlett notes that, according to the surveys, the percentage of women in banking and finance who had used an off-ramp, and who wanted to return to their former employers, was zero.Much of the problem is just blockhead management. For example, a woman identified only as Judith, who has three children, tells the author that “it wasn’t unusual for an e-mail to go out at 5:30 p.m. announcing a meeting at 7 p.m. — which could drag on to 8:30.” Predictably, “very little was covered that could not have been dealt with by e-mail — or in person the next morning.”Judith took a severance package and spent time with her children, then hungered to return to high-paying work. But with a gap in her résumé, she remained unemployed.More deeply, flexibility meets resistance because it takes away an advantage that men have over women. In the surveys, almost half the professional women on the rise were childless. Men, of course, can marry late and still tap their reproductive potential.Still, men come off as indispensable to female success. (Even elderly male bosses who father children Picasso-style can be helpful, she notes, as they discover the joys of some work-life balance.) And in a hierarchy, the C.E.O.’s stance on gender equity proves decisive.Of course, some companies still continue shelling out tens of millions in sex discrimination suits and fritter away shareholder money by losing talented employees.“If a $2,000 desktop computer disappears from an employee’s desk, I guarantee that there’ll be an investigation,” Maury Hanigan, a consultant, tells Dr. Hewlett, adding that “if a $100,000-a-year executive with all kinds of client relationships” quits “to stay home with the kids — there’s no investigation.”'"
"'07-08-05,'0','The Astro, which weighs 6 ounces, is meant for large and medium-size dogs, which can carry it easily. “It’s not going to work that well on a Chihuahua,” said Ted Gartner, a spokesman at Garmin’s main United States subsidiary, in Olathe, Kan.The unit on the dog’s collar computes the animal’s location from G.P.S. satellites and radios the information to the owner’s hand-held unit. The dog units also have tiny motion-sensing chips that detect when the dog is running, sitting or on point.The system will keep track of dogs up to five miles away in the countryside, Mr. Gartner said. If the dog goes over a mountain, the radio signal between dog and owner will probably be lost, because the radio needs a line of sight to communicate. “But the hand-held G.P.S. unit will tell you the last known location, so you can hike and regain the signal on the other side of the mountain,” he said.Several G.P.S. systems on the market track dogs by sending location alerts to a cellphone, but Garmin had a reason for not going that route. “Dogs are not always in areas that have cell coverage,” Mr. Gartner said.For dogs that are at home alone while their owners are at work, a start-up company, SNIF Labs of Boston, is developing a lightweight tag that logs, among other details, how much exercise the animal is getting. Small enough even for Chihuahuas, the tags are in preliminary testing and are scheduled for limited release in November at a price of $199.95.The tags contain computer chips to detect a dog’s motion inside and outside the house. “When the dog is out,” said Noah Paessel, chief executive, “the computer on the tag is running and collecting information on walking and trotting, and storing it in memory on the dog’s tag.”When the dog returns home, the data stored on its collar are beamed by radio to a nearby receiver connected to a home computer and then to the company Web site for analysis and display.The tags can also be used for networking. (The company’s name, by the way, stands for Social Networking in Fur.) If dogs wearing the tags meet, the chips on their collars exchange identifying signals, Mr. Paessel said, and a record of the meeting can be kept on the server. If they wish, the owners can then contact one another, too.Puplight, at www.puplight.com, uses a different technology for its dog tags: light-emitting diodes, fashioned into shining medallions that resemble smaller versions of the L.E.D. headlamps worn by hikers and cave explorers, at $19.95. The bright beams of the L.E.D.’s are intended to make dogs more visible — especially those that are small and dark in color and may be hard to see at night, said Jacquelyn Simoni, president of the company, which is based in Glen Ellyn, Ill.Consumers can expect many more technology-based pet products, according to a recent report from Packaged Facts, a research firm in Rockville, Md. Those may include dog monitoring and retrieval systems that work with video cellphones.Many of the products will result from companies adapting their goods for dog lovers. “It is a very attractive way to expand sales and profit margins,” said Mr. Dillon, the pet market consultant.'"
"'07-08-05,'0','Bjorn Hanson, a lodging consultant at PricewaterhouseCoopers, says that changing demographics have helped to fuel the brand explosion. “If you’re a hotel company and you have nine brands, you’ve got a diversification strategy in case preferences change,” he said.The rising cost of real estate has also played a role. “It’s becoming harder to find sites,” Mr. Hanson said, “so we see many of these midpriced hotels as ways to have growth on smaller pieces of ground, because land is expensive.” (Midpriced hotel rooms range from about $150 to $250 a night.)Competition, meanwhile, has taken the art and science of hotel branding to a new level. Enormous resources are being poured into researching and designing hotel rooms, lobbies, amenities and services — all intended to inspire brand loyalty by creating what hoteliers hope will be a distinctive experience for guests.The Hyatt Corporation has announced three new brands in the last two years: Hyatt Place, Hyatt Summerfield Suites and, most recently, Andaz, a global brand that will make its debut next month in London. Executives say that they are the most researched brands in Hyatt’s history.And after considerable testing, the InterContinental Hotel Group, the largest hotel company as measured by number of rooms (more than 558,000) will open its ninth Hotel Indigo, a boutique brand, in Amherst, N.Y., by the end of the summer. “We’re the largest hotel company in the world but we own less than 25 hotels,” said Leslie McGibbon, vice president for global corporate affairs at the InterContinental Hotels Group, which, in addition to Hotel Indigo, has six other brands, including Holiday Inn and Crowne Plaza. “It’s a franchise model,” he said, “so we’re the brand manager and we make sure the positioning is spot-on in order to drive guests to that hotel. That’s what we’re paid a fee for.”Even small boutique chains that do not have the muscle of a global corporation are spending years on design and marketing before a single guest turns down the 500-thread-count bed sheets. Nylo Hotels, an independent boutique brand announced in 2005, will open its first hotel in December in Plano, Tex., with a second to follow next year in Providence, R.I.“Every 15 or 20 years in the hospitality business, a new category emerges,” said John Russell, the chief executive of Nylo Hotels, which is based in Atlanta. “In 1983, Marriott defined the limited-service hotel. Now it’s time for a whole new category, the lifestyle brand. People like their Mini Coopers, they like to be connected, they like different architecture and design, and they live in loft-style apartments. Yes, 30 new brands have been launched, but only three or four will rise to the surface, and that hinges on creating a unique brand.”Nylo is customizing everything in its guest lofts (don’t call them rooms), including the staff’s fashion wear, which was designed by Daniel Vosovic, one of the more successful contestants from the cable television series “Project Runway.” Nylo is also spearheading a contest with local artists, whose work will be selected for display throughout its hotels. But Mr. Russell says that this is not just about décor but also about experience, a word often repeated by hotel brand developers.Nylo has decided to have at least one floor in each hotel dedicated to allergen-sensitive guests. That move was based on research showing that one in four travelers has reactions to certain chemicals and fabrics.Of course, not every hotel group is looking to turn its brand into a chain. Kimpton Hotels — whose properties include the Sir Francis Drake in San Francisco and Hotel Palomar in Washington — prefers that each of its hotels remains distinctive. The Hotel Monaco in Washington, for example, “used to be a post office that was built in 1832,” explained Michael A. Depatie, the chief executive of Kimpton.“We crafted a hotel out of a four-story, marble building that is architecturally significant, and infused it with a whimsical design,” he said. “The story of that building permeates that whole hotel, and it’s authentic.“While there are other hotels with the name ‘Monaco’ in our portfolio, we don’t need or want to announce them as part of a chain,” he continued. “It defeats the purpose of a unique experience.”Still, Ross Klein, the chief executive of Starwood, who was instrumental in developing the W Hotels brand, says hotel branding, even as part of a chain, is as much an art as a science. Exhaustively researching details like a showerhead is important, but the sum is greater than the parts, he said.“When people are traveling,” he said, “the first thing they’re asked is, ‘Where are you staying?’ The answer, the hotel brand, becomes an emotional representation of the guest’s personality, and that is new to the landscape.”'"
"'07-08-05,'0','What Do You Have Against Yeshivas?I was amazed to read “Neighbors Oppose Yeshiva’s Building Plans” (July 15), about Ohr Hameir in Cortlandt Manor, because I’ve been living in the same neighborhood for over 20 years — I jog past the yeshiva every day, and had no idea anyone was opposed to a new dormitory.This is not a day school, or even a commercial temple. The people who teach and study there come from all over the world, and live on the premises. They create zero traffic. I rarely ever have seen any cars go into its lot. The only visibility of the students is when they go for a stroll along the side of the road or when they’re shopping at A&P.Right down the road from the yeshiva is a dreadful rifle range that turns every weekend in Cortlandt Manor into Baghdad — the sound of gun blasts heard for miles, even from within one’s house with the windows closed — and nobody complains at all. Why would they oppose the presence of quiet, timid, introverted students who spend all day inside, studying ethics and law and praying?Another aspect of “redevelopment” (“Now You Own It, Soon You Don’t?,” July 29) is that a municipality can hold a property hostage for years. I own a building, where I conduct my business, in Long Branch, N.J. We’ve been in the “redevelopment zone” for 10 years! During this time my property has become virtually unsalable.Buyers are reluctant to purchase properties located in redevelopment zones because of the potential for economic loss. Several times potential buyers have told me that because of the redevelopment designation they were not interested in my property.'"

"'07-08-05,'0','MOTT HAVEN, a hard-luck neighborhood in the South Bronx, is getting its first-ever condominium project to be built with private financing, according to Wilhelm Ronda, the director of planning and development for Adolfo Carrión Jr., the Bronx borough president.The project, called Bronx Bricks, is a five-story, red-brick former print shop at 305 East 140th Street, between Third and Alexander Avenues. The building will have 11 units in two sizes, 1,300 and 2,200 square feet. Each has an open floor plan and maple floors original to the 1904 building.Prices are $395,000 to $795,000, and since sales began last month, two units have gone into contract, said Linda Cunningham, a managing partner on the development team. Like Ms. Cunningham, who made photo-transfer collages in the building, many of the team members are artists who used to have studios there.Ms. Cunningham has been a co-owner of the building since 2000, when she bought it from Ernest Milchman, the founder of Milchman Enterprises, a developer based in New York. (Both refused to say what they had paid.)Ms. Cunningham is taking one of the two 2,000-square-foot ground-floor commercial spaces. The other will most likely be leased to a nonprofit group or to an architect, she said.“It was a challenge to be the first,” Ms. Cunningham said. “But now we can serve as the comparable for banks for future development.”'"

Brodsky as saying about eminent domain, “The bottom line is we can fix the law so it protects average people and still maintain it as a tool.”Like bank robbers who maintain crowbars and guns as tools for stealing money, governments maintain eminent domain as a tool for stealing people’s homes and businesses.'"
"'07-08-05,'0','“Ready?” Chib asked, scooping up the paintings in his arms.The four of them went into the living room, Hate dumping the art dealer on a chair. The man’s hands were tied behind him, his mouth covered with tape. Mike thought about pouring himself a drink but wasn’t sure his hand would be steady enough.“See this?” Chib said. He’d put the paintings down on the coffee table and was pointing toward a framed picture on the sofa.“It’s your Utterson,” Mike told him. “Dusk on Rannoch Moor.”“That’s right. And what did I do with it?”“I’m guessing he drove down to London and went looking to verify it.”Chib was nodding, eyes boring into Mike. Then he turned and fetched the painting, holding it in front of Mike’s face. “I’m not exactly what you’d call an expert,” he said, “so maybe you know better. When was this painted?”“Is that so? Then would you care to tell me what you see in the bottom left-hand corner?’“Right at the very corner, Mike,” Chib suggested. And then Mike saw it and screwed shut his eyes. “Well?” Chib prompted.“Looks like there’s a condom lying in the grass,” Mike muttered.“That’s right. So maybe you can explain to me why Utterson felt the need to add that particular touch?”“It’s Westie,” Mike said. “It’s what he does.”“I know it’s what he does. What I can’t understand is why you’d do this to me. You really thought I was so stupid I wouldn’t notice?” Chib sounded incredulous.“I don’t know anything about this.”Chib burst out laughing. “You can do better than that, Mike.”“I promise you I can’t, because it happens to be the truth.”“Well, we’ll just go ask Westie, shall we? But before we do, there’s the little matter of my fee. What I’d like from you, Mike, is 150,000 pounds. That way, Mr. Hate can return home, job done. The amount of grief you’ve caused me, I should be asking for more, but let’s start at 150.”“I’ll go fetch my wallet,” Mike drawled, receiving a punch to the gut for his efforts. His knees buckled. Chib crouched down with him, grabbed him by the hair and yanked his face up from the floor.“Am I in the mood for jokes?” the gangster asked.“I don’t keep cash around the house,” Mike gasped. “And even going to the bank — it takes time to arrange that sort of money.” He looked past Chib toward Hate. “Maybe you’d consider taking a painting?”Hate’s response was to walk over to the coffee table, lift one of Mike’s two Monboddo oils, and stick his fist straight through it. Calmly, the huge man lifted the other Monboddo the glorious portrait and did the same thing.“I think so,” Mike groaned, starting to get to his feet as Chib released the hold on his hair. “So what now?” he asked of nobody in particular.“We wait here till morning,” Chib replied. “Then a little trip to the bank, followed by a visit to our art student-cum-forger.”“You’ll talk them round.” Chib was walking toward the coffee table, where Allan’s paintings sat, unharmed. Chib’s mouth twitched. “Might just take these, unless you’ve got an objection?”“Then you can sort it out with Allan.”Mike turned his attention to the art dealer. “Sorry about all this,” he said. “I mean, I’m sorry for what’s going to happen. They need me, at least for another day or two, but you . . . you they’re just about done with. And Hate doesn’t seem the type who likes loose ends.”“Just thought he ought to know.” Then, to Chib: “I really don’t know what Westie was playing at. Gissing checked all eight paintings. . . . ” He broke off, starting to get the glimmer of a notion.“Yes?” Chib prompted. But his attention was diverted by a movement behind him. Watts-Fulton had leapt to his feet and was running, slamming into the nearest door, which flew open, the art dealer disappearing inside, Hate right behind him. Mike took his chance, shoved the off-balance Chib and did his own running. Watts-Fulton had blundered into the master bedroom, but Mike was headed for the front door. He flung it open and bounded down the stairs, taking them three at a time. Out the front door, thankful Chib hadn’t brought his minders with him. He sprinted to the nearest wall and scrambled over it, landing in somebody’s garden. Then the wall after that and the next after that, ending up back on the street. There was an alley people used as a shortcut, too narrow to get a vehicle down. He took it and kept moving — another wall, another garden.Keep moving, he told himself. He had his wallet in his trouser pocket, which meant bank notes and credit cards. But no cellphone. His options were limited: stay hidden and wait for morning, or aim for a main road where a taxi might pick him up. After about 20 minutes, he paused to catch his breath, crouched low behind a hedge. His knuckles were grazed, shins bruised, and there was a stabbing pain in his chest. He knew he should head straight to Westie’s, warn him what was coming. But that would probably be the gangster’s first stop too. If he went to the police, he might be able to save the art dealer’s life. But what was he going to tell them? And what was the point, when Hate and Watts-Fulton would be long gone? Mike shut his eyes, trying to impose some order on his thoughts.If Chib would be headed for Westie’s apartment, his own best bet was Allan’s. They could always call the student on Allan’s cellphone. From his hiding place, he heard the distinctive diesel chugging of an approaching cab. He peered over the hedge and saw that its roof light was on, meaning it was available. He leapt from hiding and stuck out an arm. The taxi stopped and he jumped in, telling the driver to take him to Morningside.“Lucky you caught me,” the cabbie told him. “My shift finishes in half an hour.” Then, having noted the disheveled figure slumped across the back seat: “Had a bit of a night of it, eh?”The look of horror on Allan’s face did nothing but deepen as Mike told his story. They tried Westie’s number, but he wasn’t answering. Mike left a warning message, to which Allan added a yelled coda:“It’s your own stupid fault, you moron!”Mike snapped the cellphone closed. “Maybe he’s still out looking for Alice.”“The pair of them can go rot.” Allan was pacing the room, his dark red bathrobe wrapped around him. “What are we going to do, Mike? I knew something like this would happen. I knew it would all go wrong!”“First thing you can do, Allan, is get some clothes on. After which, maybe you could try calming down.” He wanted to add that he was the one who’d been assaulted, the one who’d been scared witless as he leapt from garden to garden, the one known to Chib and Hate both. . . . Somehow, he didn’t think it would help. So instead, he repeated his first instruction and watched Allan nod distractedly, then stalk toward the bedroom.Mike poured himself more coffee and allowed his head to rest itself against the back of the chair. He even let his eyelids close themselves for a few seconds, but the image of Chib Calloway’s furious face made him open them again. Allan was coming back into the room, buckling his belt.“What did Westie think he was doing?” he was asking. “And how come he didn’t swap the forgery for the original?”“The Utterson was in your vault, Allan,” Mike said quietly.“The Utterson was one of the paintings you lifted from the warehouse.”“No, but I think I’m beginning to. We need to speak to Gissing. He’ll be the next person Chib and Hate go after.”“And next after that will be me?” Allan guessed.“Sorry, you’re at the foot of his list,” Mike said, producing a thin smile from his friend.“You might be sorry, but I’m not.” For some reason, this exchange caused them to start laughing, Mike’s shoulders heaving. It took a little time for them to catch their breath, Allan dabbing at the corners of his eyes.“How did we ever get into this?” he asked, shaking his head.“Let’s concentrate on how we’re going to get out of it,” Mike stated. Allan held something up, and Mike took it from him. It was Inspector Ransome’s business card, complete with phone number.“Last resort,” Mike said, tucking it into his pocket. “First off, we go see Gissing.”“What if they’re waiting for us?” Allan’s nerves had reappeared. Mike thought for a moment.“Let’s get your car,” he told his friend. “And I’ll explain on the way. . . . ”he problem with Edinburgh’s nighttime streets was the lack of traffic, meaning they would be easy to pick out. Mike knew that Chib drove a BMW, but he supposed Hate would have a car, too, and he had no idea what type it would be. Every time they saw headlights coming toward them or had to make a stop at traffic lights, Mike was wary. The few taxicabs still operating were doing little or no business. Mike considered a detour to Westie’s tenement building, just to check the lay of the land, but he didn’t think Allan would be keen and wasn’t sure it would be worth the risk. Professor Gissing lived in a large detached property in Juniper Green, on the outskirts of the city. Allan and Mike had been guests there at a couple of parties, where Gissing introduced them to critics, college staff and a few established artists — one of whom, over dinner, doodled on his paper napkin, Allan pocketing the result as the table was being cleared. Mike mentioned the incident as they headed out of town, trying to keep his friend’s mind from other things.“Always meant to frame it,” Allan responded with a nod. “Maybe I should have asked permission before lifting it. . . . ”It was another mile or so before Mike told him to pull over. They were still a few hundred yards shy of Gissing’s house. It sat behind a low wall on the main road into town. Allan turned off the ignition and the headlights and handed his cellphone to Mike, who made the call.“I think someone’s breaking in next door,” he told the operator. “I heard glass smashing. The old guy lives there on his own, so I’m a bit worried.” He gave Gissing’s address and then hung up.“And now we wait,” he said.Quiet night in the city — must have been, when it took the patrol car only four or five minutes to arrive. The uniformed officers got out, one holding a flashlight. They opened the garden gate and walked in. Mike waited to see if any of the other cars parked curbside would suddenly start to move, but nothing happened.Allan turned on lights and ignition both and they cruised past the house, Mike staring hard. The cops had checked the front and disappeared round the back. The flashlight was casting shadows against the neighboring house and the garage Gissing never used, not owning a vehicle.“Drive on a bit farther and do a U-turn,” Mike ordered. Allan did as he was told and they passed the house again. The cops were out front again, trying the doorbell, peering through the mail slot. Mike could hear the crackle of a two-way radio.“Or they’re keeping very quiet,” Mike added. They parked again and waited until the patrol car moved off. Five more minutes, just to be sure, and then Mike gave the nod. They got out and, still keeping their wits about them, walked quietly back toward the house. No lights had come on in any of the neighboring properties. None of the cars nearby was a BMW.“Maybe they took him with them,” Allan whispered.“Maybe,” Mike said, not really believing it. He walked up the path and headed for the living-room window, pressing his face to the glass. But the wooden shutters were closed on the inside. There was another window to the left of the front door — Gissing’s dining room — but the shutters were closed here, too.Mike ignored him and headed to the side of the house, taking the path past the garage. The rear garden was silent, the moon appearing suddenly from behind a bank of cloud, so that Mike had all the light he needed. The conservatory was empty. They took coffee and brandy there on the night of one of the dinners, seated on wicker furniture. But now there was nothing. No shutters at the kitchen window, allowing Mike to peer inside. Again, the room had been cleared.“He’s done a runner!” Allan gasped. Mike took a couple of steps back, his feet landing on something solid. A cardboard sign attached to a wooden stake. He lifted it up, so that Allan could see for himself the words for sale, across which another piece of card had been attached, this time with just a single word printed on it.“All the way down the river,” Mike muttered, tossing the placard back onto the ground.Next week: When things don’t seem as if they can get worse, they do.'"
"'07-08-05,'0','THE macrocosm spectacle, the one that draws the above-the-radar incredulity and outrage, would be the indictment of the National Football League star Michael Vick on charges of operating what law enforcement authorities describe as an illegal dog-fighting — and dog execution — emporium in the backyard of a McMansion he owns in suburban Virginia. In that case, pit bull corpses told the tale. Anonymously.By coincidence, there is a local connection. But its victims are the opposite of anonymous.The microcosm version of the Vick case surfaced on Long Island in mid-July when a 9-year-old child discovered a nearly dead 2-year-old pit bull named Spike — big doses of bleach and gasoline combined with a well-aimed lighted cigarette will do that to an otherwise robust creature — chained to a tree in Brentwood.The horrified child called 911. The dog, after being rescued by equally horrified officers from the Suffolk County Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals and hustled to the operating table of a local veterinarian with a pro-bono conscience, could not be saved. He died on July 17. But there is a “but” to this debacle, and a potentially happy ending.With the help of a hefty reward — $20,000 was the announced figure, although continuing contributions have pushed it toward $30,000 — it was quickly learned that Spike’s owner was Derick Phanord, a 22-year-old Brentwood resident. He is being held in the Riverhead jail on $50,000 cash bail and faces a two-year prison term on a felony charge, aggravated cruelty to animals. (Before 1999, when New York adopted Buster’s Law — Buster was an incinerated cat — animal cruelty was a misdemeanor.)Mr. Phanord claims he killed Spike in retaliation for the dog’s aggressive behavior, including an attack on his pit bull puppy Red, the police said. In his statement to the police, Mr. Phanord, who has pleaded not guilty to charges of animal cruelty and possessing a weapon — a bludgeon — explained that he had to hit Spike on the head with a shovel (breaking his palate in the process) in order to separate the dogs.'"
"'07-08-05,'0','In his lengthy essay on Günter Grass (July 8), John Irving, so scathing of European and American intellectuals who have been dismayed at Grass’s lie concerning his service in the Waffen SS, scandalously never mentioned what for most has been the true context of the matter — the Holocaust. Grass has been admired not only for his literary talents, but as a moral leader; all of Europe respected his demands (even when excessive, such as his wrong insistence on collective guilt) that Germany and Europe come to terms with the meaning of Auschwitz. In response to Europe’s long silence about the Holocaust and general cover-up of collaboration with the Nazis, Marcel Reich-Ranicki has pointed out that the Group ’47 (both Reich-Ranicki — a Holocaust survivor — and Grass were members of the literary group), in their silence about the Holocaust during the l950s and ’60s (the writers wrote mostly about gritty sex and American materialism), were guilty of a certain form of anti-Semitism. (Can we imagine a book about the South during the civil rights movement with hardly a mention of blacks?)Yet Irving merely wonders if Grass’s excess feeling of guilt has to do with what happened to the Poles, and is amazingly casual about the import of Grass’s lie. But (as I suggested in Slate) Grass’s private demons actually may have had more to do with his and his family’s anti-Semitism, and his acceptance of the murderous Waffen SS anti-Semitic propaganda that led to the Holocaust, than with his actual service in the unit. Irving takes as his hero Oskar Matzerath, the stunted drum player in “The Tin Drum” who refuses to grow up. But when Grass, in “Peeling the Onion,” continues to treat Oskar as though he were alive and the author of the book, the literary conceit becomes an evasion. Those critics, including myself, who have questioned this subterfuge should not have to read in the Book Review that we ought to feel ashamed.'"
"'07-08-05,'0','The eight shelter staff members working that day scrubbed and clipped the dogs. By lunchtime, Jason Mollet, a kennel attendant, was not looking so pristine himself and called home for clean clothes. His parents, Janice and Brian Mollet, owners of a Medford grooming salon, rushed over with clean clothes, grooming supplies and an offer to roll up their own sleeves.Ms. Mollet said: “I was nervous at first about what their temperaments might be like. But I got over it right away, because as I was bathing the first cocker spaniel, it was licking me.” She said the dogs needed five or six baths apiece.After veterinary care and some food, the dogs turned out to be cuddly dynamos. “They’ve been playing in the yard and jumping all over us,” said Annelie Indilla, a trainer at the shelter.One dog whose baths had restored his fluffy white coat was taken to a new home right away by a grooming salon employee, Marla Harman, and her husband, Robert Harman, of Lindenhurst. Some of the dogs were sent to the Animal Rescue Fund of the Hamptons, a private shelter in Wainscott, and others remained at the Southampton town shelter.Two pregnant dogs had rotting teeth, and some dogs were being treated for eye and skin infections.Because the dogs had been crammed into crates, they are being housebroken, and Ms. Indilla said they were also learning leash skills. “Right now, they kind of zigzag all over the place when you walk them, because they’ve never been on a leash before,” she said.Before the 19 dogs arrived, the shelter was already lively, holding 54 dogs, 143 cats, 2 rabbits and a hamster. Though Mastic is not part of Southampton Town, Donald A. Bambrick, the shelter supervisor, said he offered its facilities to the Suffolk S.P.C.A. for this case “in the spirit of cooperation.”Mr. Gross said this was one of the worst cases of animal abuse he had encountered in 23 years on the job. It was not the biggest, however; in June, 54 abused dogs were found in a Medford home.Perhaps the worst, he said, was a dog found July 12 that had been abused, tied to a tree, doused with gasoline and set on fire; the dog later died. Donations poured in, and a $20,000 reward led to the July 24 arrest of Derick Phanord, of Brentwood, on several charges, including aggravated cruelty to animals.Working with abused animals can be an emotional roller-coaster ride, Mr. Gross said.“The gruesome stuff gets to you, it really does,” he said. “But this case where the dogs went to the Southampton shelter has a beautiful ending, and that’s what makes you go on.”'"
"'07-08-05,'0','THOSE of us given to habitual Goodwill hunting in western Connecticut have noticed that something upscale has been astir amid the Corning Ware and vinyl go-go boots. It’s a quiet revolution in quality reusables that is turning the charity’s area stores into spacious, well-appointed, not-your-granny’s thrift shops known as Goodwill Super Stores. Brand new or retrofitted, they boast bigger selling areas, color coordinated displays and gleaming new fixtures.“If you build it nicer, they will come,” according to David H. Turner, president of Goodwill Industries of Western Connecticut, who oversees 15 stores from Torrington to Stamford. Mr. Turner stood amid the preopening bustle of the newest 13,000-square-foot Super Store here on Federal Road. It was scheduled to have its official ribbon cutting on Friday with decidedly unthrifty hoopla: live radio coverage, discounts, refreshments and prizes.Mr. Turner is hoping for an excellent first year in Brookfield, with projected gross revenues of $1.5 million to $2 million. In preparation, managers from other stores hustled to fill racks with designer jeans and juggled wineglasses and copper-clad pans in the housewares department. Outside, pavers and bulldozers smoothed the way for donors who will be able to make drive-through deliveries directly to a sheltered loading dock, a crucial asset according to Mr. Turner:“Brookfield has an upper middle-class demographic. Part of the new philosophy is to build where it’s very accessible to the donors. We find that if you make it easy for donors, the shoppers will find there’s good stuff at this place, and plenty of it.”The store is also easy to find, set in the middle of a growing bargain belt on Federal Road that extends past Costco to the popular Elephant’s Trunk flea market in New Milford.Mr. Turner says he is pleased with the overall progress of his 10-year campaign to tart up and streamline the dowager operation, including its headquarters and adjoining store in Bridgeport. “It’s a more realistic, better training experience for the people we serve,” he said. “I think there’s an essential pride when you work in a real store instead of a mom and pop thrift operation.”'"
"'07-08-05,'0','What do the various indexes tell us about the inflation rate? Over the past five years, prices have risen at an annual rate of 3 percent on the official C.P.I. and by 2 percent on both the core C.P.I. and core P.C.E. series. All of these indexes understate the rate of inflation they presume to report. All the price data are broken down into three major classes: durable goods, like automobiles, skis and computers; nondurable goods, like food, clothing and newspapers; and services, like housing, medical care and haircuts. All of us make frequent purchases of nondurable goods and services, but most of us buy durable goods only on widely separated occasions — largely because durable goods, by definition, last a long time.None of that would matter much if the prices of durable goods moved up and down along with the prices of everything else. But they do not. According to the P.C.E. figures, the prices of durable goods have declined 20 percent since 1995, while the overall index has increased by 27 percent. Here, too, a complication intervenes. The actual decline in durable-goods prices is less than the decline shown in the indexes.In the mid-1980s, I bought one of the first I.B.M. desktop PCs. Including software, the bill came to some $10,000. Last January, I bought a new Dell for less than $2,000. I need not describe the huge difference in quality and capability. In an instance like this, the Bureau of Labor Statistics would not only show the price of computers at a fifth of the old price, it would show an even lower price to reflect the enormous increase in quality. The bureau refers to these adjusted changes in prices as “pure” price changes. For example, computer prices declined 6.6 percent at an annual rate from March to September 2004, but the pure price decline worked out to 9.8 percent. Index price adjustments for these qualitative improvements are known as “hedonic pricing,” and the bureau makes generous use of this technique. I have no quarrel with it as a matter of principle, but I do take issue with the impact of durable-goods prices on the overall indexes. The occasions when we buy durables are relatively few and far between — unlike our frequent purchases of nondurables and services, like food, newspapers and transportation.IF both the B.L.S. and P.C.E. series publish adjustments excluding food and energy, why not an additional series that includes food and energy, but excludes durable goods? Such an index would provide a more accurate and realistic view of the cost of living that all of us confront each day. This index would have shown an inflation rate of 3.1 percent over the past year, versus only 1.9 percent for the Fed’s core P.C.E. series. Over the past five years, the new index would have shown inflation at 3.3 percent a year, versus 3 percent for the official C.P.I. and 1.9 percent for the core P.C.E.This is big stuff. In five more years at these rates, the core P.C.E. would be up 10 percent, but our hypothetical index would have climbed 17.6 percent. There may be more stewing in the inflationary cooker than the current government indexes are telling us.'"
"'07-08-05,'0','Q. I love visiting the Bronx Zoo, but I always wonder: Does the zoo have a problem with wild animals moving in, like skunks, raccoons and possums?A. Well, the zoo doesn’t exactly consider them a problem, but it doesn’t ignore them, either.“It’s no secret that there is native wildlife on the grounds of the Bronx Zoo,” said Patrick Thomas, general curator of the zoo. Animals like skunks and raccoons are nocturnal; because they usually don’t show themselves during the day, visitors rarely see them.When such an animal does appear during the day, Dr. Thomas said, it may be sick and thus a threat to visitors, staff and the zoo’s animals. An animal department team traps the creature, which is then examined in the zoo’s Wildlife Health Center. If the animal is sick and possibly rabid, it is killed humanely, and the remains are sent to the state veterinarian. (If you should see a nocturnal animal anywhere during the day, the safest thing is to keep your distance and call the local animal control agency.)One nocturnal animal living around the zoo, by the way, is José the beaver, who last fall was found to have set up camp on the Bronx River, which flows through the zoo. José is the first North American beaver known to have shown up in the city in 200 years.Q. My family would love to take a firehouse tour. Does the Fire Department have open houses?A. There are opportunities to hear firefighters discuss equipment and give tips, but not by calling up the local firehouse. The firehouses have no regular open hours, said Tony Sclafani, a spokesman for the Fire Department.'"

"'07-08-06,'1','As the Sacorafases make their way to Minnesota from their home in Encinitas, Calif., they join other families wrenched by the tragedy. And as the families of the five victims whose bodies have been found — and as families of the missing were dealing with their private grief — this city so jolted by the disaster was seeking public ways to try to heal.On Sunday, people streamed up a hill overlooking the Mississippi. The collapsed bridge was barely visible from there, but scores came anyway, hushed and staring toward the water.“I drive over it virtually every day,” said John Abraham, 33, of Minneapolis. “It’s hard for people who don’t live here to get an idea of how critical this bridge is to connecting the city.”Lee and Ken Elvrum of Coon Rapids brought their granddaughters, Joelle, 12, and Jaelyn, 10, who urged them on the way to Minneapolis to “drive fast over the bridges, because it’s scary.”They brought daisies “for the mother that’s missing, the one who’s pregnant with the 2-year-old baby,” said Mrs. Elvrum, referring to Sadiya Sahal, a Somali refugee and nursing student who was crossing the bridge with her daughter, Hana.On Saturday, new life was juxtaposed with death at a funeral Mass for Artemio Trinidad-Mena at Holy Rosary Catholic Church in the heart of Minneapolis’s Mexican community. As Mr. Trinidad-Mena’s coffin rested beside the baptismal font, his 2-month-old daughter, Lorena, was baptized.“One of his plans this month was to baptize his daughter,” said Julio Alvarado, manager of the vegetable distributorship where Mr. Trinidad-Mena worked.Members of the city’s large Somali community, whose epicenter is near the bridge, sent a letter to state and city leaders expressing sadness and offering help.During Sunday services at St. Mary’s Greek Orthodox Church, hundreds of parishioners prayed for Ms. Sacorafas, who was headed for the church to teach folk dance to children, her trunk filled with costumes she had sewn for the dancers. Hoping for a miracle, Father Paul Paris said he would not speak of her in the past tense. Ms. Sacorafas moved to the Minneapolis area from California three years ago, was going through a divorce and had a serious boyfriend, her father said. She had forged a strong bond with the church.Some relatives of the missing were allowed to visit the bridge site during the weekend, watching the painstaking recovery operation as divers confronted whipsaw currents, submerged debris and water so black that visibility was limited to six inches. No bodies had been recovered since Thursday.The police have identified eight of the missing but say there could be more.“We have been actually sending squads to homes and knocking on doors,” said Capt. Mike Martin of the Minneapolis Police Department. “We have subpoenaed records for vehicle leases. We’ve used all our databases to check for information. We have requested dental records for family members. We’re trying everything we can think of.”“I have lost two husbands, and now, a child,” said Dorothy Svendsen, mother of Gregory Jolstad, 45, who was part of a construction crew working on the bridge and who was among the missing. Despite hoping that he be found, Ms. Svendsen said she did not want rescuers risking their lives to search for her son.Mr. Sacorafas said: “There’s a Greek saying: With every obstacle there’s something good that’s come out of it. The good that comes out of it is everybody just checking all of the bridges in the country. We were just damn lucky — not me personally — that only five people so far have been found dead and only maybe 13 were lost altogether.”Mr. Sacorafas’s own accident decades ago left him with speech and memory problems for a couple of years. Ever since Cynthia’s accident, he and his wife, Aphrodite, have cared for her because she was left with poor memory, little control of the left side of her body, and has had several seizures and a stroke.“You cry for awhile,” Mr. Sacorafas said. “You moan for a while — ‘Why me, God?’ — all that stuff. Eventually you just pick up yourself by your bootstraps, and you go on.”'"
"'07-08-06,'1','The relatively early discovery of a possible local source of the disease found in cattle at a farm at Guildford, in Surrey, increased hopes that the British authorities would be able to get the situation under control and avert the panic that engulfed the agriculture industry during an outbreak in 2001.The Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said the strain of the virus found at the farm was used in a vaccine batch manufactured last month by Merial Animal Health.The company is an arm of Merial Ltd., which is jointly owned by the American drug maker Merck & Company and the French company Sanofi-Aventis. Merial Animal Health announced that it was suspending production of the vaccine.The environment department’s statement said, “The present indications are that this strain is a 01 BFS67 like virus, isolated in the 1967 foot-and-mouth disease outbreak in Great Britain.”Prime Minister Gordon Brown held another emergency meeting at 10 Downing Street on Sunday morning, the third since the government announced the outbreak on Friday evening.Mr. Brown, who interrupted his summer vacation to take charge of the crisis, was eager to avoid the economic disaster of the 2001 outbreak, when millions of cattle and other livestock were slaughtered and burned. Tourism also slumped badly that year.The BBC reported Sunday that an investigation of the government’s Institute for Animal Health after the 2001 outbreak found that the laboratories were “shabby” and below standard. The investigation also found, according to the BBC, that important senior staff were about to leave, creating a dearth of required skills.But Mr. Benn announced that four farms that had reported cattle with symptoms similar to foot- and-mouth disease had been found not infected, a sign that the disease may not have spread extensively.Even so, Mr. Benn warned that until the government was confident that it had found the source of the virus, farmers should remain on guard. “It’s very important that people continue to be vigilant,” he said.The European Commission announced Saturday that it had banned all live animal exports from Britain. Meat and dairy products from the affected region were also banned, the commission said.On Saturday, the farm in Surrey, about 30 miles southwest of London, where the outbreak was found, slaughtered and then burned the carcasses of 60 cattle. A herd of livestock at a nearby farm was also slaughtered and burned as a precaution, said Britain’s chief veterinary officer, Debby Reynolds.In some echoes of the consequences of the widespread outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in 2001, some agricultural shows were canceled this weekend, including in Cambria County, which was badly hit last time.A major tourist attraction, Woburn Abbey in Bedfordshire, which includes a deer park and a safari park, closed as a precautionary measure.'"
"'07-08-06,'1','RICHMOND, Va., Aug. 5 (AP) — Oliver W. Hill, a civil rights lawyer who was at the forefront of the legal effort that desegregated public schools, died Sunday at his home here. He was 100.In 1954, Mr. Hill was involved in the series of lawsuits against racially segregated public schools that became the Supreme Court’s landmark Brown v. Board of Education decision.“He was among the vanguard in seeking equal opportunity for all individuals, and he was steadfast in his commitment to effect change. He will be missed,” said L. Douglas Wilder, who in 1989 became the nation’s first elected black governor and was a confidant of Mr. Hill’s. Mr. Wilder is now the mayor of Richmond.In 1940, Mr. Hill won his first civil rights case in Virginia, one that required equal pay for black and white teachers. Eight years later, he was the first black elected to the Richmond City Council since Reconstruction.A lawsuit argued by Mr. Hill in 1951 on behalf of students protesting deplorable conditions at their high school for blacks in Farmville became one of five cases decided under Brown.Mr. Hill never lost sight of the importance of the 1954 ruling. Without it, he said this year in an interview in The Richmond Times-Dispatch, he doubted that the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. “would have gotten to first base.”'"
"'07-08-06,'1','Joe Levy, executive editor of Rolling Stone, said he expected his magazine’s DVDs would appeal to both “longtime and new readers.” He added, “To music fans, 40 years of the magazine’s music coverage is truly monumental, and to fans of Hunter S. Thompson and ‘Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas,’ the idea that you’ll be able to read everything he wrote for Rolling Stone is exciting.”The Playboy DVD will come with a paperback book that Mr. Hefner edited, as well as a facsimile of Playboy’s first issue, which has never before been fully reproduced. The book will have a copy of a receipt for $1,000 that Mr. Hefner received in September 1953 from his mother, Grace, for “one-thousand (1000) Class A Shares in HMH Publishing Co, Inc.” and a letter — signed “Love, Hugh” — that he sent to his parents. In it, he calls their support ""just about the nicest thing you have ever done for me,"" especially, since “much of the magazine will not be material that you fully, personally approve of.”Also reproduced for the first time is a ledger page, in Mr. Hefner’s handwriting, listing his initial expenses, which included a payment to a Chicago calendar company for the photographs of Ms. Monroe.The DVD sets will go on presale online on Sept. 1, and be sold elsewhere online and in stores in November. The Rolling Stone set — which includes a one-year subscription to the magazine — is $125, while the Playboy set is $100.Don Nicholas, managing director of the Mequoda Group, a digital publishing consulting company in Bristol, R.I., said digital publishing of archives had not caught on because magazines “don’t think about repurposing their content as a primary way to generate revenue.”He said the ability to reformat content and store it on DVDs “has become much easier and cheaper in the last couple of years. Given there are probably several hundred consumer magazines that have a collectible aspect to them, I expect you’ll see more and more magazines come out with archives on DVD.”Playboy was a pioneer in the magazine industry when it started its Web site in 1994 and Cyber Club, which sells online memberships to view nude photos, in 1995. Mr. Hefner said that the company agreed to publish its archives on DVD because the magazine “probably more than any other really reflects the changes in the last half century, in images and pop culture and writing.”He added, “To make that available not only is a business opportunity, but an opportunity of expanding the brand in general. The nature of publishing and entertainment has changed, and taking advantage of the new technology is from the very beginning what we’ve been all about.”Mr. Hefner predicted the archives would appeal “both to people of nostalgia of a certain age, who will remember their own particular decades,” and to “people who missed it, the fascination with retro for younger generations.”He said editing the companion book was “a real nostalgia rush for me, it takes me back to those wonderful beginnings.” Playboy, Mr. Hefner said, “went through some very, very difficult times in the conservative ’80s and early ’90s,” but then “half a dozen years or so ago, the brand became hugely popular again.”Bondi plans to publish new DVD sets of Playboy issues , from the 1960s through the present, from 2008 through 2010. Asked which decade of Playboy was his favorite, Mr. Hefner cited the first three.“To some extent, it’s like children,” he said. “What are you going to say? Does one have a favorite child? I confess to a more personal interconnection to the oldest children, because it was so much of an intimate experience for me then.”'"
"'07-08-06,'1','WASHINGTON, Aug. 6 — The Defense Department cannot account for 190,000 weapons, including more than 110,000 AK-47 rifles, issued to Iraqi security forces, a new report by government investigators says.The study, issued last Tuesday by the Government Accountability Office, also said that because of missing and incomplete records, the United States military cannot confirm that Iraqi security forces received 135,000 pieces of body armor and 115,000 helmets.The report is not the first to criticize Defense Department procedures for tracking equipment distributed to Iraqi forces by the department. A report last October by the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction found major discrepancies in American military records involving hundreds of thousands of weapons intended for Iraqi security forces.Since 2003, the United States has spent about $19.2 billion to equip and train Iraqi forces, the G.A.O. report said, and recently the Defense Department requested another $2 billion.'"

"'07-08-07,'1','BEIJING, Aug. 7 — Human rights groups today accused China of failing to improve its record on civil liberties and continuing to harass lawyers, dissidents and journalists despite official promises to make human rights a centerpiece of the 2008 Olympics in Beijing.Meanwhile, a group of Chinese scholars, journalists and lawyers wrote an open letter to President Hu Jintao and other national leaders calling for the release of political prisoners, including jailed Chinese reporters and inmates convicted on religious grounds. The group wrote that China’s Olympic slogan, “One World, One Dream” should instead be “One World, One Dream, Same Human Rights.”The broadsides over civil liberties came from such groups as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, as well as journalism advocacy organizations, and signal how China’s human rights record is likely to come under growing scrutiny as the Olympics draw nearer. The timing is hardly a coincidence: Wednesday begins the one-year countdown to the Olympics opening ceremony and a public relations battle has erupted between Beijing officials, who are planning a major celebration, and advocacy groups who want to use the milestone to attract attention to their causes.“Unless the Chinese authorities take urgent measures to stop human rights violations over the coming year, they risk tarnishing the image of China and the legacy of the Beijing Olympics,” Irene Khan, secretary general of Amnesty International, said in a statement.In its report, the group said several political activists in Beijing face either tight surveillance or house arrest. At the same time, the group said Chinese journalists are being targeted in an ongoing crackdown. Meanwhile, police officers are sweeping up vagrants and other Beijing residents under a controversial policy that allows them to detain people for up to four years without trial. The Amnesty report described the detentions as part of a citywide “clean-up” operation to prepare for the Olympics.'"

"'07-08-07,'1','INDIANAPOLIS, Aug. 6 (AP) — Indiana Pacers forward Jermaine O’Neal is not demanding a trade to the Los Angeles Lakers, but he is open to the idea.While O’Neal has been the subject of trade talk since the Pacers missed the playoffs for the first time in 10 years, the new discussion was stirred up Monday when SI.com quoted O’Neal as saying he would “welcome a trade to the Lakers” and mentioned the Nets as another possible destination.O’Neal, a six-time All-Star, played down the trade talk in a later interview.“I don’t think me saying I’d like to go with those teams is me saying I want to be traded,” he said.O’Neal said he recognized that the Pacers were rebuilding with young players and that he might not be part of future plans.“If they want to move in a different direction, I wouldn’t be disgruntled about it,” he said. “If I am traded, it would be seven great years I had with this team.

"'07-08-07,'1','Yesterday was no different as Wall Street had another roller coaster day and the Dow Jones industrial average erased Friday’s losses with a nearly 287-point gain to close the session at 13,468.78.But behind all the volatility what has been happening in recent weeks is the virtual seizing up of nearly the entire spectrum of the credit markets — from mortgage-related securities to high-yield bonds and even European corporate debt.“The liquidity in the credit markets was abysmal,” said William H. Gross, chief investment officer of the bond management firm Pacific Investment Management Company, known as Pimco. “On Friday afternoon, the brokers were unwilling to make markets in almost anything that didn’t have a Treasury or agency sticker attached to it. That’s pretty bad.”The trading-in-a-vacuum phenomenon is only the latest evidence of how the days of easy, cheap money for corporations and individuals alike have disappeared. The ripple effect is being felt by nearly everyone.Home buyers are paying more for mortgages. Mortgage lenders are closing shop as large banks turn off the spigot of money to them. Large and small corporations are also paying more to borrow — if they can find anyone willing to lend them cash. The same goes for flashy private equity firms, which have curbed their deal making and forced their bankers to scramble to drum up loan packages for buyouts already in the works.In this bond market rout, debt instruments have had billions of dollars of value wiped out in just a few weeks. By some estimates, the high-yield market alone has lost nearly $50 billion in value since early June. Others say losses in the less easily traded mortgage- and asset-backed securities markets could easily run in the hundreds of billions of dollars.Paradoxically, the turmoil in the credit markets comes against the backdrop of relatively decent advances in economic growth and fairly robust corporate profit growth. The default rates on corporate debt remain well below average levels for the past decade.“Either this is the start of something really bad and we are heading toward a recession,” said Joseph M. Balestrino, fixed-income market strategist at Federated Investors, “or it is an emotional reaction and creating a lot of opportunity in a lot of asset classes.”In Washington, the Bush administration is cautioning that the recent volatility in bond and stock markets is no cause for alarm because of the underlying strength of the American economy and because recent market declines should be thought of as an adjustment to past lending excesses.“We have the strongest global economy I’ve seen in my business lifetime,” Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. said in Beijing last week. “We have a healthy economy in the U.S. So what is going on in my judgment is a reassessment of risk.”The Treasury chief has sounded that upbeat note since the beginning of the recent market turmoil. But the administration may try to go further in soothing investors nerves tomorrow, when President Bush visits the Treasury Department for a long-scheduled annual meeting on the economy.Whatever the future holds, many say what is leading this debt meltdown is the recognition that credit in recent years had simply become too cheap and too accessible for far too many individuals, hedge funds, private equity firms and corporations.Indeed, many are convinced that the fallout in the mortgage market will continue as billions of dollars in mortgages reset to higher rates, starting this fall.Home borrowers are likely to have fewer options as many lenders continue to struggle. Yesterday , American Home Mortgage, once the nation’s 10th-largest lender, declared bankruptcy, while two other lenders suspended making new loans to consumers.As for Wall Street, questions are rising about the billions of dollars in loans numerous banks and brokerage firms have guaranteed to buyout firms to complete planned acquisitions of companies.When investors steered clear of the $12 billion in loans that banks were trying to sell to finance the buyout of Chrysler, the banks and brokerage firms wound up putting that debt on their books. By some estimates, financial institutions have committed themselves to issuing $200 billion to $300 billion in financing to allow buyouts already in the pipeline to go through.Major financial institutions like Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase, which were among the biggest lenders to private equity firms, have enormous balance sheets to help them weather the storm. But smaller investment banks may be seriously thrown off course; already, according to insiders, they are becoming more careful about deploying capital elsewhere.“There’s a big problem right now with unsold financing for leveraged buyout commitments that the brokerage firms have to work off and that is discouraging them from actively providing liquidity into the high-yield market,” said Marty Fridson, publisher of Leverage World, a research service that focuses on high-yield debt.The gap between prices for high-yield corporate debt and Treasury securities in early June traded at a historic low, suggesting that investors saw little more risk in owning the debt issued by companies with blotchy credit histories than in government-issued debt. In a matter of weeks, that spread has more than doubled.“We knew it would have to reprice to reality,” said Jack Malvey, chief global fixed-income strategist with Lehman Brothers. “But we’ve moved from reality to high anxiety.”That fear of taking on further risk has translated into fewer bonds being offered into the market.High-yield bond offerings fell off a cliff last month. In July, only $2.4 billion in junk bonds were issued, a steep decline from the $22.4 billion that came to market in June, according to Thomson Financial.High-quality bonds issued by companies with sterling credit have not been immune to the rout either. Investment-grade bond issues fell to $30.4 billion in July — the lowest monthly total in five years — from $109 billion in June, according to Thomson.For all the turmoil, some are confident that the credit market door will not stay shut for long. Despite withdrawing a $215 million bond sale late last month, Silverton Casino Lounge said it hoped to return to the markets very soon.“We’ll wait for a better time,” Silverton’s president, Craig Cavileer, said. “We anticipate this is more of a short-lived sentiment.”'"
"'07-08-07,'1','SEATTLE, Aug. 6 (AP) — The Xbox 360 video game console from Microsoft will be $50 cheaper starting Wednesday, confirming leaked advertisements posted by bloggers in July.The company said its most popular console, which comes with a 20-gigabyte hard drive, will cost $349.A basic console without a hard drive or wireless controllers will retail for $279, $20 less, while the Xbox 360 Elite, a black version with a 120-gigabyte hard drive and high-definition video support, will drop $50, to $449.Microsoft has been dodging questions about a price cut since its competitor Sony slashed the price of its 60-gigabyte PlayStation 3 to $499, from $599, in July. The Nintendo Wii, the least expensive of the so-called next-generation consoles, costs $250.Last week, representatives of Wal-Mart Stores, Toys “R” Us and Microsoft refused to say whether blurred images found online — purportedly showing weekend ad circulars reflecting the price cuts — were authentic.Aaron Greenberg, a group product manager for Xbox 360, said in an interview Monday that the ads were real.

"'07-08-07,'1','American taxpayers are rightly prepared to pay for all the equipment our soldiers need to defend themselves in Iraq. What is harder to accept is that because of the Pentagon’s scandalous mismanagement, they may have been paying to arm Iraqi insurgents who are shooting at American soldiers.The Government Accountability Office reports that more than 100,000 AK-47 assault rifles and another 80,000 pistols that Washington thought it was providing to Iraqi security forces in 2004 and 2005 are now unaccounted for. More than 100,000 pieces of body armor and a similar number of helmets have also gone missing.These numbers represent the discrepancy between the equipment ordered by the American commander in charge of training Iraqi forces and the equipment actually logged into the property records of those forces. Disturbingly, that commander was Gen. David Petraeus, now the overall commander of American forces in Iraq.The missing weapons amount to fully 30 percent of the weapons handed out by Washington to Iraqis through the start of this year. Some were presumably diverted into black market arms bazaars where they were picked up for cash, no questions asked. Some almost certainly ended up in the hands of insurgent militias, who use small arms fire to force American military convoys into the path of roadside bombs.The G.A.O. is now looking to see if large numbers of American-bought weapons have also gone missing from the program to train and equip Afghan security forces.In the past, the State Department has managed these train-and-equip programs. In Iraq, the Pentagon insisted on taking charge, just as it insisted on taking charge of everything else — whether or not it had the competence to do so. Remember the arrogant sidelining of the State Department’s experts, who had actually spent time thinking about how to manage a post-invasion Iraq? The result is one more failed policy that has put the lives of American troops at even greater risk.'"
"'07-08-07,'1','Akzo Nobel, the world’s largest maker of paints and coatings, raised its bid for Imperial Chemical Industries to £8 billion ($16 billion) and won access to the British company’s books.Akzo offered 670 pence a share in cash, the companies said yesterday. That is 22 percent higher than I.C.I.’s close on June 15, the day before Akzo, based in Arnhem, the Netherlands, made its first bid.Akzo plans to sell the adhesives and electronic materials units of the I.C.I. subsidiary National Starch and Chemical Company in the United States to the German consumer chemicals supplier Henkel for £2.7 billion.The rest of I.C.I., the maker of Dulux and Glidden paints, would increase Akzo’s revenue by almost 40 percent, to $25 billion, and bolster paint sales in the United States and China.“Akzo is in the driving seat, as a counteroffer doesn’t look likely,” said Stuart Fraser, a money manager at Brewin Dolphin Securities in London. “I think they’ll get taken over at about this price.”Akzo shares fell 0.42 euros, to 59.13 euros, in Amsterdam.

"'07-08-07,'1','“I’m not sure today’s move is any more significant than Friday,” said James W. Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management. “We’re in volatile conditions now. Eventually we’ll bottom out and we’ll go on to new highs again.”Federal Reserve officials, including the chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, will most likely keep their benchmark short-term interest rate unchanged at 5.25 percent. But futures contracts show that investors are increasingly betting that the troubles in the housing and debt markets will force the Fed to lower the rate to 5 percent by the end of the year and to 4.75 percent by March.The “best assumptions are that Bernanke will keep rates unchanged but take the opportunity to prime the markets for a rate reduction should credit conditions deteriorate further,” Bruce Bittles, chief investment strategist for Robert W. Baird & Company, wrote in a note to clients.If the Fed indeed moves in that direction, financial companies are likely to benefit. In the last several weeks stocks of big banks and brokerage firms, among others, have fallen significantly as investors have worried about companies’ exposure to rising mortgage defaults and about the falling price of bonds backed by home loans. There are also concerns that the buyout boom may be coming to an end because of rising borrowing costs.An index of financial stocks was up 4.7 percent yesterday, led by Citigroup, the American International Group, Wells Fargo and Fannie Mae, the big buyer and packager of mortgages.Shares in Fannie Mae were up 10.4 percent, to $62.50, and those of its cousin Freddie Mac were up 7.7 percent, to $60. Investors appear to be betting that the government-sponsored companies will do well as investors’ appetite for risky mortgages dries up because of higher defaults on those loans. Mortgages that conform to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac guidelines are considered much safer, in part because they are backed by the two companies.The shares of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac also rose on reports that they were seeking the approval of their regulator to buy more mortgage assets.The rally even spread to shares of Bear Stearns, the investment bank that ousted one of its presidents after two hedge funds under his supervision failed. Early in the day, Bear Stearns shares were down as much as 7.9 percent, but they shifted course significantly in the last hour and a half of trading and closed up 5 percent, to $113.81.In commodity markets, oil and gasoline prices retreated significantly from historic highs, on concerns that demand may slacken as the American economy cools. The near-month futures contract for crude oil at the New York Mercantile Exchange fell 4.5 percent, to $72.06, its biggest one-day decline since January.Just last week, crude oil futures set a record at $78.21 a barrel. Oil prices are still up about 18 percent for the year.Treasury prices fell slightly. The price on the 10-year note dropped 13/32, to 98 5/32. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 4.74 percent, from 4.68 percent.Following are the results of yesterday’s auction of three- and six-month Treasury bills:'"
"'07-08-07,'1','Two Democratic presidential candidates, Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton and former Senator John Edwards, are moving to tap into the economic anxieties of working Americans by introducing proposals to deal with the home-loan crisis and the flood of imports from overseas.In a speech scheduled for this morning in New Hampshire, Mrs. Clinton is to propose providing $2 billion in federal money to help “at risk” homeowners avoid foreclosures and to assist state and local governments build rental properties and other housing for families in need.Mr. Edwards yesterday seized on the recent imports of tainted pet food and unsafe toys from China to argue that the United States needs new trade policies to protect both its workers and its consumers.According to a preview of her remarks provided by her campaign, Mrs. Clinton, of New York, will lay out a plan to deal with mortgage lending abuses and to “preserve the dream of homeownership” at a time of crisis in the mortgage markets as homeowners default or face foreclosure when their adjustable rates climb upwards.Mrs. Clinton’s plan, according to the outline her campaign provided, zeroes in on “unscrupulous brokers.” She would require mortgage brokers, in their dealing with borrowers, to explain that they make more money when borrowers’ mortgage rates and fees are high. She would also establish a national registration system for brokers so that borrowers can do background checks, and pledged to work with states to develop licensing standards to ensure that brokers are properly qualified.'"
"'07-08-07,'1','To enter the United States for United Nations conferences, foreigners must apply for a visa, usually by obtaining what immigration officials call a “letter of request.” The letters are typically written by officials for the United Nations or whatever other agency may be sponsoring the conference.According to the complaint, Mr. Manokhin and Mr. Derevianko sent fake letters of request beginning in 2005 to both a United Nations office in Uzbekistan and the United States Embassy in Tashkent, the Uzbek capital. The letters were often signed “Leonardo Brackett” or “Greg Smith,” who were identified as United Nations officials but who did not exist, the complaint said.In June 2005, for instance, Leonardo Brackett’s name appeared on a letter sent on Mr. Tursunov’s behalf to the office of the United Nations Development Program in Uzbekistan, prosecutors said. The letter sought a visa that would allow Mr. Tursunov to attend an annual United Nations conference in New York, though Mr. Tursunov later told federal officers that he had never attended the conference, according to the complaint.In an interview with officers this year, Mr. Tursunov — still in the United States — said that while he was living in Uzbekistan, he was approached by an associate who told him he could get a United States visa for $15,000, the complaint said. He gave the man his passport and $8,000, the complaint added, and three months later he received a letter signed by Leonardo Brackett. He then used the letter to obtain a visa application from the United Nations, paid the man an additional $7,000 and, soon thereafter, received his passport with a visa, prosecutors said.In January, the complaint said, Mr. Manokhin sent a letter to the United States Embassy in Tashkent requesting a visa for an Uzbek citizen, who was not named in the complaint, to attend a law conference in New York. The conference — which did not exist, prosecutors said — was described as “a round table” concerning “alternatives to pretrial incarceration,” complete with “representatives of charitable organizations” and “specialists who work in the field.” Sessions would take place from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. daily, the letter said, “except Saturday and Sunday.”As part of its investigation of Mr. Manokhin, federal officers visited the Lower Manhattan law firm where the conference was supposed to have taken place and interviewed the receptionist. She said that no conference had been scheduled, according to the complaint. The officers also interviewed a lawyer at the firm who was one of the founding directors of the agency that had supposedly arranged the round table. He, too, had never heard of such a thing, the complaint said.'"
"'07-08-07,'1','WASHINGTON, Aug. 6 (AP) — Federal authorities said Monday that American Express was ordered to pay the government millions of dollars in penalties for alleged violations of anti-money-laundering provisions.The Federal Reserve and the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network of the Treasury Department — known as FinCen — said their orders were part of an action coordinated with the Justice Department.“The payments to be made by the American Express entities under these actions total $65 million,” according to a joint release issued by the Fed and FinCen.Federal authorities accused American Express Bank International of Miami and the American Express Travel Related Services Company of Salt Lake City of violating the Bank Secrecy Act. Both entities — without admitting any wrongdoing — consented to the penalties, the two agencies said in their release.“We have cooperated fully with the government and understand the need for absolute vigilance in our efforts to protect against money laundering,” said an American Express spokeswoman, Susan Atran. “We have already made substantial efforts to augment and strengthen our compliance programs and will continue to do so. We are firmly committed to the agreements we have reached and to conducting our business with the highest standards of integrity, compliance and control.”The Fed determined that American Express Bank International had significant breakdowns in carrying out compliance activities under the Bank Secrecy Act. It said the company failed to create an adequate anti-money-laundering program as well as procedures to monitor compliance.Banks and other financial institutions are required to have anti-money-laundering programs in place. Those programs are important to government efforts to catch terrorist financiers, drug lords and other criminals. Financial companies are also responsible for reporting suspicious financial transactions to the government.'"
"'07-08-07,'1','While the bill also bans the slang word “ho,” the b-word appears to have acquired more shades of meaning among various groups, ranging from a term of camaraderie to, in a gerund form, an expression of emphatic approval. Ms. Mealy acknowledged that the measure was unenforceable, but she argued that it would carry symbolic power against the pejorative uses of the word. Even so, a number of New Yorkers said they were taken aback by the idea of prohibiting a term that they not only use, but do so with relish and affection.“Half my conversation would be gone,” said Michael Musto, the Village Voice columnist, whom a reporter encountered on his bicycle on Sunday night on the corner of Seventh Avenue South and Christopher Street. Mr. Musto, widely known for his coverage of celebrity gossip, dismissed the idea as absurd.“On the downtown club scene,” he said, munching on an apple, the two terms are often used as terms of endearment. “We divest any negative implication from the word and toss it around with love.”Darris James, 31, an architect from Brooklyn who was outside the Duplex, a piano bar in the West Village, on Sunday night was similarly opposed. “Hell, if I can’t say bitch, I wouldn’t be able to call half my friends.”They may not have been the kinds of reaction that Ms. Mealy, a Detroit-born former transit worker serving her first term, was expecting. “They buried the n-word, but what about the other words that really affect women, such as ‘b,’ and ‘ho’? That’s a vile attack on our womanhood,” Ms. Mealy said in a telephone interview. “In listening to my other colleagues, that they say that to their wives or their friends, we have gotten really complacent with it.”The resolution, introduced on July 25, was first reported by The Daily News. It is being considered by the Council’s Civil Rights Committee and is expected to be discussed next month.Many of those interviewed for this article acknowledged that the b-word could be quite vicious — but insisted that context was everything.“I think it’s a description that is used insouciantly in the fashion industry,” said Hamish Bowles, the European editor at large of Vogue, as he ordered a sushi special at the Condé Nast cafeteria last week. “It would only be used in the fashion world with a sense of high irony and camp.”Mr. Bowles, in salmon seersucker and a purple polo, appeared amused by the Council measure. “It’s very ‘Paris Is Burning,’ isn’t it?” he asked, referring to the film that captured the 1980s drag queen scene in New York.The b-word has been used to refer to female dogs since around 1000 A.D., according to the Oxford English Dictionary, which traces the term’s derogatory application to women to the 15th century; the entry notes that the term is “not now in decent use.”But there is much evidence that the word — for better or worse — is part of the accepted vernacular of the city. The cover of this week’s New York magazine features the word, and syndicated episodes of “Sex and the City,” the chronicle of high-heeled Manhattan singledom, include it, though some obscenities were bleeped for its run on family-friendly TBS. A feminist journal with the word as its title is widely available in bookstores here, displayed in the front rung at Borders at the Time Warner Center.Robin Lakoff, a Brooklyn-born linguist who teaches at the University of California, Berkeley, said that she despised the word, but that enforcing linguistic change through authority “almost never works,” echoing comments from some New Yorkers who believed a ban would only serve to heighten the word’s power.“If what the City Council wants to do is increase civility, it would have to be able to contextualize it,” said Ms. Lakoff, who studies language and gender. “You forbid the uses that drive people apart, but encourage the ones that drive people together. Which is not easy.”Councilman Leroy G. Comrie Jr., the Queens Democrat who successfully sponsored a symbolic moratorium on the n-word that was adopted Feb. 28, said he supported Ms. Mealy’s measure, but acknowledged that the term had many uses.“We want to make sure the context that it’s used is not a negative one,” Mr. Comrie said yesterday.Back at the West Village piano bar on Sunday evening, Poppi Kramer had just finished up her cabaret set. She scoffed at the proposal. “I’m a stand-up comic. You may as well just say to me, don’t even use the word ‘the.’ ”But at least one person with a legitimate reason to use the word saw some merit in cutting down on its use.“We’d be grandfathered in, I would think,” said David Frei, who has been a host of the Westminster Kennel Club dog show in New York since 1990. The word is a formal canine label that appears on the competition’s official materials. But Mr. Frei said he worried about the word’s impact on some viewers, especially younger ones.“I think we have to take responsibility for that word on the air. The reality is it’s in the realm of responsible conduct to not use that word anymore.'"
"'07-08-07,'1','American Home Mortgage Investment filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection yesterday in Wilmington, Del., capping a tumultuous 10 days for what had been one of the nation’s biggest home lenders.The company, based in Melville, N.Y., said it fell victim to “extraordinary disruptions” in the markets that support the mortgage industry. A weak housing market and a spike in payment defaults scared investors away from mortgage debt, including bonds and other securities backed by home loans.As the company took its first steps in restructuring, two other lenders — Aegis Mortgage and the mortgage unit of National City — said yesterday that they had stopped taking or had suspended loan originations.At American Home Mortgage, the company 40 biggest creditors include many of the major names on Wall Street.

Simply put, doping is a safety issue, not a cheating issue.Doping rules exist to prevent athletes from having to make a choice between their own short-term success and their long-term health. If doping becomes accepted, or legal, than it will be no more a choice than the use of the latest technology to remain competitive.Since fans and owners are often more than happy to sacrifice their athletes in favor of amusement or profit, it becomes the athletes’ burden to collectively negotiate assurance of their own protection.Until athletes realize the health risks of doping, and become the loudest voices in its prevention and regulation, it will continue to be rampant and unstoppable in sports.'"

To appreciate the value of such a seemingly counterproductive measure, you need to know something about connective tissue and how the body normally repairs it.When tissues are injured, inflammation is a common natural response. It stimulates substances carried in blood that produce growth factors in the injured area to promote healing. Ligaments, tendons and cartilage have very poor blood supplies, which can result in incomplete healing.The healing process can also be impeded when injuries are treated with anti-inflammatory medications like ibuprofen or Naprosyn, or prescribed nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (Nsaids) to relieve pain and swelling.Unlike injections of corticosteroids, which also suppress inflammation and provide only temporary relief for a chronic condition, prolotherapy injections given over the course of several months are meant to provide a permanent benefit. In effect, prolotherapy tricks the body into initiating a healing response.The technique reactivates the healing process by injecting a mildly irritating substance — commonly a somewhat concentrated sugar solution along with the painkiller lidocaine — into the injured area to stimulate a temporary low-grade inflammation. In some cases, growth factors themselves may be injected.With growth factors in place at the site of inflammation, new tissue is said to be produced that strengthens lax or unstable ligaments and tendons. The technique may even support damaged or degenerated cartilage, which normally does not repair itself, by strengthening the fibrous connective tissues that stabilize the area.Practitioners cite experiments in laboratory animals that demonstrated tissue growth in ligaments and tendons stimulated by prolotherapy injections. Two animal studies also showed healing of cartilage defects.Prolotherapy cannot correct mechanical problems like spinal stenosis, in which two bones pinch a nerve, nor does it reverse arthritic changes. But it may reduce or even eliminate the discomfort associated with arthritis by tightening the connective tissues that support an arthritic joint.A leader in the field, Dr. Donna Alderman, an osteopathic physician who is medical director of the Hemwall Family Medical Centers in California, published two long articles on prolotherapy this year in the magazine Practical Pain Management. She wrote that “prolotherapy has been used in the United States for musculoskeletal pain since the 1930s,” that it has been endorsed by former Surgeon General C. Everett Koop, and that it is increasingly being used to treat injuries in professional athletes.Prolotherapy is also now the subject of a controlled clinical trial sponsored by the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine, part of the National Institutes of Health.Since prolotherapy is a nonsurgical technique, patients who are now facing surgery because all else has failed might consider trying it before having an operation. Unlike many drugs and surgery, prolotherapy has minimal side effects when performed by an experienced practitioner who uses sterile techniques. Patients may experience bruising and a temporary increase in pain in the injected area because of the induced inflammation. Rare risks include infection, headache, nerve irritation or allergic reaction.Does It Help?There have been dozens of studies purporting to show benefits of prolotherapy for people with chronic pain as well as those with sports injuries. Among scientifically designed controlled studies, most showed a significant improvement in the patients’ level of pain and ability to move the painful joint.According to Dr. Alderman, in a study of people with chronic low back pain resulting from injured ligaments in the sacroiliac joint, biopsies done three months after treatment showed a 60 percent increase in the diameter of connective tissue. The patients reported a decrease in pain and an increased range of motion.In studies of knee injuries, patients with ligament laxity and instability experienced a tightening of those ligaments, including the often disabling anterior cruciate ligament in the center of the knee, Dr. Reeves showed in a double-blind study. Other studies showed a significant improvement in the symptoms of arthritis in the knee one to three years after prolotherapy injections.Dr. Alderman cautions that prolotherapy is appropriate only for patients with musculoskeletal pain who do not have underlying conditions that would interfere with healing and who are willing to receive painful injections in an effort to recover.A state-by-state listing of prolotherapy practitioners can be found at www.getprolo.com. Beware of practitioners who make rash promises, fail to take a full medical history and to tell you about the technique and its side effects, or who work in a disorderly or unclean facility.'"
"'07-08-07,'1','Further, transportation and engineering experts said, lawmakers have financed a boom in rail construction that, while politically popular, has resulted in expensive transit systems that are not used by a vast majority of American commuters.Representative James L. Oberstar, Democrat of Minnesota and the chairman of the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, sent out a news release last month boasting about Minnesota’s share of a recent transportation and housing appropriations bill.Of the $12 million secured for the state, $10 million is slated for a new 40-mile commuter rail line to Minneapolis, called the Northstar. The remaining $2 million is divided among a new bike and walking path and a few other projects, including highway work and interchange reconstruction.The $286 billion federal transportation legislation passed by Congress in 2005 included more than 6,000 earmarks, which amounted to blatant gifts to chosen districts, including the so-called Bridge to Nowhere in rural Alaska (that earmark was later removed after a political uproar).Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, said in a telephone interview Monday that earmarks for transportation in federal legislation were “almost always new construction and not maintenance.” Earlier, Mr. Schumer said that he would introduce legislation next month to double a proposed federal transportation bill appropriation, with a focus on upkeep to $10 billion.“The bottom line,” Mr. Schumer said, “is that routine but important things like maintenance always get shortchanged because it’s nice for somebody to cut a ribbon for a new structure.”Last week, Representative John L. Mica of Florida, the ranking Republican on the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, met with advisers to the Bush administration to urge a nationwide plan to address transportation needs. Rebuilding the I-35W bridge would be only “a Band-Aid” Mr. Mica said, “to a much more serious problem.”“We don’t have any kind of strategic plan to deal with infrastructure, and we’re falling behind,” he said.In statehouses across the country, legislators tried this past session to fill some of the void by passing bond acts or allocating money to improve roads, bridges and other pieces of the transportation system.In Arkansas, lawmakers set aside $80 million, 15 percent of which will be used to repair county roads, 15 percent for city byways and the rest for its highways. New Mexico approved a $200 million plan for local and tribal road projects, and in Texas, $700 million was allotted for state transportation projects over the next two years.Voters in California this year authorized nearly $20 billion in transportation bonds to pay for repairs and make other improvements to its taxed system.“We still barely scratched the surface,” said Adam Mendelsohn, the communications director for Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, a Republican. “The governor is very concerned about the lack of attention that the federal government has given to infrastructure. It is probably no more acute than in California because of the tremendous strains from population growth.”The federal budget for transportation comes largely from excise taxes, particularly on gasoline, set by Congress at 18.4 cents in 1993 and eroded over time by inflation and fuel efficiency. As such, over the last decade, state legislatures in 14 states have voted to raise the state gas tax 19 times. And several states are looking at toll roads and congestion pricing initiatives to help shore up the roads.The National Conference of State Legislatures, a group with members from all 50 states, is calling for a 3-cents per gallon increase in the federal gas tax.C. Michael Walton, a professor of civil engineering at the University of Texas, Austin, helped write a series of reports issued by the American Society of Civil Engineers that have repeatedly found the nation’s highway system with insufficient money. “Continually falling short of the actual needs,” Professor Walton said, results largely from “our backlash to increases in taxes.”Professor Walton said states had been looking to the federal government for leadership. “I am not sure transportation falls to the top of the priorities as it should barring a catastrophic failure,” he said in reference to state government spending.A study released in May by the Urban Land Institute and Ernst & Young found that 83 percent of the nation’s transportation infrastructure was not capable of meeting the country’s needs over the next 10 years. The American Society of Civil Engineers, in its latest national report card, gave transportation infrastructure a D.Meanwhile, there are urgent needs. The Interstate highway system turned 50 last year and is showing signs of age and inadequate upkeep. Around St. Louis, for instance, old bridges, rocky roads and tight ramp loops have led to a shutdown of parts of Interstate 64/Highway 40 — one of the most important corridors in the state — until late 2009.“It’s so easy to let this stuff slip,” said Robert Dunphy, a senior resident fellow at the Urban Land Institute.The national highway system, originally called the National System of Interstate and Defense Highways, came into being under the Eisenhower administration. (The country’s population was 169 million then, and there were about 54 million registered vehicles on the roads.) It was spurred by fears that Americans would have a mobility crisis if the country were attacked in a nuclear war. By the 1970s much of the system was completed.But since then, the nation’s highways have eroded with age and use, especially in areas like the Southwest where population booms have far outweighed the ability of roads to carry the new drivers.Typically financing for capital transportation projects comes from the federal government matched with funds from states, which are then charged with maintaining the roads and bridges. But the federal government and states operate trust funds, filled with revenues from various excise taxes, which have been unable to maintain existing roadways adequately or finance capital expenditures.But it may often be less the amount allocated for transportation than how it is doled out that leads to eroding highways, some critics say.“Highway funding is supposed to be on the basis of need,” said Raymond Helmer, a transportation consultant in Houston who has worked on transportation projects for over 50 years. “There is supposed to be cost-benefit analysis, and every state does a study as required by federal government and comes up with needs, but then politicians say, ‘I don’t want that road here, I want it here.’ ”Some transportation experts also said that though light rail and other public transportation projects made sense in cities, investing in them in sprawling suburban regions might not, even if the systems were supported, in theory, by the public.“Too many American cities are spending far too much money on expensive rail transit projects, which are used for only 1 to 2 percent of local travel, and far too little on highway projects which are used for 95 to 99 percent of local travel,” Randal O’Toole, a senior fellow with the Cato Institute, said in an e-mail interview.There has also been more emphasis nationwide on building new roads than on the maintenance and upkeep of old ones. Steve Ellis, the vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense, a group that monitors federal spending, said that might help move traffic in some places, but it left many others with the equivalent of a leaky roof.“It would be irresponsible of me to go out to dinner if I couldn’t fix a leak in my roof,” Mr. Ellis said. “But that’s essentially what we do. We don’t take care of what we’ve got, but we talk a lot about building more and new.”'"
"'07-08-07,'1','When the Supreme Court voted 5 to 4 to uphold the federal Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act this spring, the ambivalently pro-choice public was largely quiescent, believing, as Congress had previously ruled, that the procedure was “gruesome and inhuman,” medically unnecessary, highly controversial in the medical community and so rare as to be little missed.What’s clear, however, as the ban has become a reality, is that fetuses will be spared no brutality. Second trimester abortion is still legal and the most common method for it — dismembering a fetus inside the womb before removing it in pieces — is no less awful to contemplate than the outlawed procedure, in which an intact fetus’s skull was punctured and collapsed to ease its removal. But women are now more at risk. And doctors have been forced into a danger zone where they must weigh what they believe to be best medical practices against the need to protect themselves from the threat of prosecution.This kind of ethical tightrope walk, this sort of judicial meddling into standard medical practices, is unprecedented — and poisonous. An article in this month’s volume of the trade journal Obstetrics & Gynecology treats the dilemma with a mocking tone. “At our recent Annual Clinical Meeting in San Diego, I asked several colleagues if they intended to make referrals to the Supreme Court. All said ‘No’ because the court is not available for telephone consultations and makes rounds infrequently,” it says.But in truth, dealing with the ban is no laughing matter. You see, as it turns out, the Supreme Court didn’t just outlaw “partial-birth” abortions (known in the medical community as “intact dilation and extraction” or D & X,) when it upheld Congress’s ban. It criminalized any second trimester abortion that begins with a live fetus and where “the fetal head or the fetal trunk past the navel is outside the body of the mother.”The big problem with this, doctors say, is that, due to the unpredictability of how women’s bodies react to medical procedures, when you set out to do a legal second trimester abortion, something looking very much like a now-illegal abortion can occur. Once you dilate the cervix — something that must be done sufficiently in order to avoid tears, punctures and infection — a fetus can start to slip out. And if this happens, any witness — a family member, a nurse, anyone in the near vicinity with an ax to grind against a certain physician — can report that the ban has been breached. Bringing on stiff fines, jail time and possible civil lawsuits.Justice Anthony Kennedy, writing for the court’s majority, asserted that prosecution for accidental partial births won’t occur; there has to be “intent” for there to be a crime. But as doctors now understand it, intent could be inferred by the degree of dilation they induce in their patients. What, then, do they do? Dilate the cervix sufficiently and risk prosecution, or dilate less and risk the woman’s health? And if they dilate fully, how do they prove it wasn’t their intent to deliver an intact fetus?'"

"'07-08-08,'1','In 1922, five years after the Bolshevik revolution, no one knew where Russia was headed. In an about-face, Lenin had initiated the quasi-capitalist New Economic Policy. For the moment, a nervous sort of freedom persisted, notably in the arts but, to a limited degree, in politics as well. Anyone looking for a portent, however, might have noticed a ship leaving Petrograd that September, carrying into permanent exile a carefully selected group of writers, intellectuals and scholars whose ideas the Bolshevik regime found objectionable. The Philosophy Steamer, as it came to be known, was followed six weeks later by a second ship. The machinery of totalitarianism was kicking into gear.This little-known chapter is recounted in fascinating detail by Lesley Chamberlain in “Lenin’s Private War.” It is a tricky tale to tell, because the names involved are unfamiliar. The idealist philosopher Nikolai Berdyaev still commands attention, but fellow passengers like the literary critic Yuli Aikhenvald, the religious thinker Semyon Frank, the sociologist Pitirim Sorokin and the medieval historian Lev Karsavin are known only to specialists today. Nevertheless, the writers and thinkers expelled in 1922 represented a grievous loss. Hope sailed off over the far horizon in the fall of 1922, along with “cultural decency and intellectual independence,” as Ms. Chamberlain puts it neatly.Ms. Chamberlain, a British historian and the author of “Motherland: A Philosophical History of Russia,” brings these forgotten figures back to life with great skill and sympathy, reconstructing their intellectual milieu and making a strong case for the importance of their banishment as a turning point in the road from revolution to Communist tyranny.She sees the episode as a continuation of the armed conflict between Red and White forces, part of what she calls the “Paper Civil War,” in which the Bolsheviks closed down independent journals, purged universities and took the first steps in creating a new intellectual class of militant Marxist-Leninists.“Only when Lenin deported the liberal intelligentsia in 1922 did the overall conflict end,” she writes.Ms. Chamberlain’s narrative divides into three parts. The first, and the most interesting, deals with the Paper Civil War. Relying on archival material that has surfaced in the post-Soviet period, she traces the quiet campaign by Lenin and his underlings to identify dangerous thinkers, round them up, manufacture legal cases against them and expel them permanently. The thinking and the procedures behind the expulsions resonate profoundly. They are the dress rehearsal for Stalinist terror to come.'"
"'07-08-08,'1','Union leaders say two giant public sector unions, the American Federation of Teachers and the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, are leaning toward Mrs. Clinton. But the strong support that those union’s locals in the Midwest feel toward Senator Barack Obama could prevent their boards from backing Mrs. Clinton.Many industrial unions, most notably the United Steelworkers, are especially enthusiastic about Mr. Edwards because of his backing of many labor causes and his strong views on limiting trade accords. Union leaders say there is a good chance that the Teamsters and Unite Here, which represents apparel, hotel and restaurant workers, will back Mr. Edwards.Divided endorsements could put organized labor in the same uncomfortable position it was in during the 2004 primaries, when unions fought among themselves, dividing their endorsements between John Kerry, Howard Dean, John Edwards and Richard Gephardt.In March, the A.F.L.-C.I.O.’s executive council had asked member unions to hold off endorsing anyone until after this week’s council meeting in Chicago. But many union presidents pushed to be freed to make endorsement after this week’s meeting.Gerald McEntee, chairman of the federation’s political committee and president of the state, county and municipal employees’ union, said he was eager for his union to make an endorsement soon to increase its influence in the caucuses and primaries, which begin in January.“In Iowa, if you don’t have boots on the ground by November, you might as well not be there,” he said.Karen Ackerman, the A.F.L.-C.I.O.’s political director, said, “When there is a consensus candidate, and that might not happen until Feb. 5 or 6, then we’ll come together in a unified program.” She said that the federation’s member unions might make an overall endorsement at that time because a likely Democratic candidate could emerge from all the primaries on Feb. 5.Labor leaders say there is so much enthusiasm about the Democratic candidates and so much anger at President Bush that they expect organized labor to mount its biggest political effort ever during the 2008 campaign.'"
"'07-08-08,'1','Mr. Bezhuashvili said he hoped to set up an international panel to examine the evidence. “We have a body of evidence,” he said by telephone. “There is a common understanding of the seriousness of the situation, and are initiating a process of calling for a special session of the U.N. Security Council.”In March, a guided missile and a barrage of unguided rockets struck remote villages late at night in the Kodori Gorge, the only area of the Russian-backed separatist region of Abkhazia that is under Georgian control. More than 50 witnesses reported the sound of helicopters during the attack, which Georgia said flew in from a Russian base.Russia denied involvement in that attack as well, though United Nations investigators issued a report this summer that strongly suggested a Russian role.That report fell short of directly accusing Russia, in part because Russia did not cooperate fully with investigators and no radar record was available.The latest missile, however, was fired by an aircraft that flew near a main highway outside Tbilisi, an area with radar coverage.Georgia said it had collected radar records from both its civilian and military air controllers that clearly show an aircraft enter from Russia, fly to the area of the strike, then turn around and fly back into Russia.Georgia also released audio recordings and a transcript of an apparently frustrated Georgian air traffic controller. The controller was talking with his counterpart in southwestern Russia asking about an unscheduled flight along the border that he was seeing on his screen, the Georgian government said.The Russian controller checked with his supervisor, according to the recording, which was released to journalists. He then told the Georgian controller that no planes were flying.“Our bosses said that nobody is there, neither by plan nor in reality,” the Russian controller said.“Well, O.K, it might be U.F.O.,” the Georgian answered.Georgia has long accused Russia of conducting military flights across the border, and Mr. Bezhuashvili said there were multiple incursions on Aug. 4 and 5. He added that tepid international response to the incursions, and the limited response to the attack in the Kodori Gorge in March, had emboldened Russia and made the latest incursion possible.The Kremlin, which continues to wage a counterinsurgency campaign against Chechen separatists and Islamic militants in the north Caucasus, backs secular separatists in Abkhazia and South Ossetia, the two breakaway regions just over the border in Georgia. It has tried to portray the region as peaceful, and will host the 2014 Winter Olympics not far away, in Sochi, even though violence continues to simmer.No motive for the attack was immediately clear. But Shota Utiashvili, the head of the analysis department for Georgia’s Interior Ministry, said the plane might have released the missile after taking fire from Ossetian separatists on the ground.The commander of Russian peacekeepers in South Ossetia on Tuesday had said on Russian national television that the Ossetians had fired at a plane, apparently thinking it was Georgian.Because the missile did not explode, its remains did not disperse widely. Many of the twisted and shattered fragments were recovered.Georgia, which briefed foreign diplomats on its findings yesterday, said the fragments made clear that the missile was an AS-Kilter, a guided missile that is nearly 16 feet long and was designed in Soviet times to home in on and destroy NATO radar installations.The missile carries an explosive charge of more than 300 pounds. Georgia said it has neither rockets nor aircraft with the capability of carrying and firing such a weapon.'"
"'07-08-08,'1','When Bonds was asked about Anderson on Tuesday night, he said: ""Just another negative question. I'm not going to get into that.""Anderson’s residence in the East Bay is surrounded by hills, office parks and razor wire. He spends about eight hours a day working in the kitchen, preparing salads. He likes the job because he can get extra eggs.According to Canny, Anderson is allowed only three hours a week to work out in the recreation yard. There is one outdoor weight room, but it is for the female inmates. The male inmates have a baseball field overrun with weeds and dirt.For the past month, Anderson has seen snippets of the home run chase but missed the details — Bonds throwing a party with Jay-Z at the All-Star Game, Bonds playing softball with kids, Bonds praying with the Rev. Jesse Jackson at Wrigley Field.The chase has been both tedious and fascinating, a window into a complex superstar. There was the day that Bonds called himself “an embarrassment,” the day he called Bob Costas “a little midget man,” and the day he called his mother for advice.In what was supposed to be a glorious period, Bonds endured his worst slump in 16 years, took early batting practice for the first time all season and complained of a rash on his head that was caused by stress. He relaxed by watching Alex Rodriguez.The most memorable day of the chase — even more memorable than Tuesday — was the afternoon of July 19 in Chicago. Bonds, hitless in 21 straight at-bats, smacked two majestic home runs over the fabled ivy at Wrigley Field.“He’s like the action hero and the villain at the same time,” said Lou Piniella, the Cubs’ manager.In the past month, Bonds was treated as such. Here, he was saluted on the scoreboard by Michael Jordan, Joe Montana and Muhammad Ali. On the road, he was confronted with inflatable syringes and foam asterisks.One fan at Dodger Stadium dressed up as Victor Conte, founder of the Bay Area Laboratory Co-Operative, which is suspected of supplying Bonds with steroids. Another dressed up as Bonds, with brown latex mask.Bonds did not have to endure the racial taunts that followed Aaron to the record, but he said that he received hate mail and death threats. In the end, though, Bonds received a raucous ovation on his home field.Washington’s starting pitcher, Mike Bacsik, had the best and worst seat. Before the game, Bacsik pondered whether he would join Al Downing as pitchers who allowed record-breaking homers. “We could do card shows together,” he joked.Bacsik, with his healthy sense of humor, might have been the perfect person to give up this homer. At first, when Bonds made contact, Bacsik grabbed the back of his head. He put his hands on hips. He took a few moments to mope on the mound.Then he started cracking jokes about himself. ""If I didn't give it up, nobody would ever remember who I was,"" Bacsik said with a grin. ""I'm part of history now.""Bacsik's father, Mike, spent five years pitching in the major leagues and once faced Aaron, when Aaron had 755 home runs. ""If my dad would have been gracious enough to let Hank Aaron hit a home run, we'd both have given up 756,"" Bacsik said.After Bascik left the game, he went to the Giants' clubhouse to congratulate Bonds. In turn, Bonds congratulated Bacsik, gave him an autographed bat, and told him that he would be watching his career unfold from a distance.Two of the principal characters in this home-run drama - Bacsik and Bonds - were linked. The other one was still 40 miles away.'"

"'07-08-08,'1','Over a three-day period in June, four New York traffic agents gave the impression they were busy by issuing a multitude of tickets. But as it turns out, they issued dozens of those tickets from the comfort of their cars or while enjoying a meal, according to police officials.The motivation for the crime was laziness, not money, the officials said.The four agents were arrested yesterday and are accused of issuing a total of 46 falsified tickets throughout Manhattan.Three of the agents, Davey Griffin, 30, Raheem King, 26, and Gregory Baird, 56, were arrested on felony charges including forgery in connection with the falsification of parking tickets. A fourth agent, Julian Fisher, 24, is facing a misdemeanor charge of official misconduct.The felony charges carry a penalty of up to seven years in prison and the misdemeanor is punishable by up to one year in jail. The four were suspended without pay yesterday. The investigation is continuing, a spokeswoman for the Manhattan district attorney said.Chief Charles Campisi, the head of the Police Department’s Bureau of Internal Affairs, said he believed that the agents did not know that the others were faking tickets. Their motivation, he said, appeared to be laziness.'"
"'07-08-08,'1','Ronny Gal, an analyst for Sanford C. Bernstein who follows generic companies like Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, Barr Pharmaceuticals and Mylan Laboratories, predicts 10 to 13 percent annual profit growth in the industry by 2010. He describes the generic trend as “good for everybody but the branded pharmaceutical companies.”Last week, the big drug maker Johnson & Johnson announced it would eliminate up to 4,800 jobs as it braced for generic competition to its drugs, Risperdal for schizophrenia and Topamax for seizures and migraine headaches.In the last year, combined United States sales of the drugs were $4 billion.Shortly after the Johnson & Johnson statement, Sanofi-Aventis announced that it had already been hard hit by low-cost alternatives to its sleeping pill, Ambien, which became available in generic form in April.As frequently happens when generics appear, sales of the name-brand Ambien plunged — to $91 million in the second quarter, from $420 million in the same period last year. Generics already account for 60 percent of prescriptions in this country. And that portion is expected to rise, as cheaper substitutes arrive to treat many chronic conditions.Already this year, consumers have flocked to new generic versions of five major drugs, including Ambien and discount alternatives to Norvasc for high blood pressure.Next year, generic competition is expected to hit Fosamax, a $2 billion drug in this country that slows bone loss and is often used by postmenopausal women. In 2009, the heartburn and ulcer medication Prevacid, a $3.5 billion product in this country, is expected to become available as a generic product. And by 2011, a generic substitute is expected for what has been the world’s single best-selling medicine, the cholesterol drug Lipitor, a drug with annual United States sales exceeding $5 billion.Several experts predict that generic drugs will keep drug price inflation in the single digits for the next several years.“It’s much better than it was in the ’90s, before these drugs started going generic,” said Dr. Steven B. Miller, chief medical officer for Express Scripts, another company that manages drug benefit plans. “The drug trend was always double digit.” As recently as 2002, he said, the annual drug inflation rate was 18.5 percent.Companies like Express Scripts are promoting the use of generics by setting lower co-payments for them, reducing the amount patients must pay out of pocket.Also helping to propel the copycat drug trend is the success of generic manufacturers in challenging patents held by brand-name companies. But another reason is that many patents are simply expiring on drugs that were introduced during the late 1980s and early 1990s, an unusually productive era of research and development for the pharmaceutical industry.Patents provide 20-year protection from generic competition. But because companies often apply for patents in early stages of drug development, before drugs are approved, pharmaceuticals may have fewer years of what is called effective patent protection.And now, as nearly every big drug maker watches its best sellers fade away, there are fewer potential blockbuster drugs waiting to take their place.“At the end of the day, it’s basically a failure of innovation,” said Richard T. Evans, a consultant with the firm Avos Life Sciences, a research and consulting firm for the drug industry. Mr. Evans said it was hard to know whether the drug industry was merely in a cyclical lull or whether it suffered from a systemic decline in productivity.But the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, the trade group for brand-name companies, said that company research and development budgets are increasing each year, even as generic competition cuts into profits.“I don’t think we would support the contention that there’s a lull,” said Caroline Loew, the industry group’s senior vice president for scientific and regulatory affairs. Citing diseases like Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s and cancer, she said, “The companies are tackling diseases that are extremely complex. The biological mechanisms are very poorly understood. By definition, that sort of science, which is very much emerging science, is going to take longer.”One way the pharmaceutical industry is working to counter the generic trend is through its own generic subsidiaries and contracts for the production of company authorized generics. Such drugs currently account for 9 percent of prescriptions dispensed in this country, according to data from IMS Health.For example, the generic unit of Pfizer, Greenstone, last year began marketing its own version of the Pfizer antidepressant Zoloft.The Food and Drug Administration approves generic drugs that contain the same active ingredients as brand-name pharmaceuticals, and the agency says that generic drugs meet the same quality standards as brand-name drugs.Yet in a study conducted in 2002 by AARP, 22 percent of those surveyed indicated they thought that generic drugs might be less effective or of poorer quality than brand-name drugs.Mr. Gal, the Sanford Bernstein analyst, said that the generic drug industry was still working to overcome such suspicions. The F.D.A. estimates that consumers can save an average of 50 percent when they switch from name brands.The actual financial benefit to individuals, though, depends largely on their health plans.Corporate drug plan managers like Medco Health Solutions and Express Scripts work aggressively on behalf of employers to encourage the use of generic drugs. One way is by setting lower co-payments for them. That may mean an out-of-pocket expense of $20 less for generics than name-brand medication. The savings can add up quickly for consumers who need multiple drugs. Medicare is also using incentives to encourage the use of generics in its Part D drug plan.James and Rosemarie Cola, a retired couple in Queens, take 16 medications between them. Over the last few years, out-of-pocket costs for several of their drugs have fallen, as generics have become available.Mr. Cola, 82, a retired hairdresser and makeup artist who earned an Emmy for his work in daytime television, recently paid only $9 for a 90-day supply of cilostazol, a substitute for the branded drug Pletal for leg pains. The drug became available as a generic in 2004.Mrs. Cola, 74, is expecting to see several of her medications become generic within the next few years, including Zyrtec for allergies, Lipitor for cholesterol, and Coreg for heart problems.“We’re living on pills,” said Mrs. Cola, a retired substance abuse counselor and social worker.Whatever the cost savings, Mrs. Cola says she must think twice before switching from one formulation to another whenever one of her drugs becomes generic.“I don’t like to change drugs,” Mrs. Cola said.'"
"'07-08-08,'1','MOSCOW, Aug. 7 — Officials of the Republic of Georgia accused Russia on Tuesday of violating the country’s airspace and firing a guided missile, which did not detonate, into Georgian territory.“We have incontrovertible evidence that the bombing occurred,” said Gela Bezhuashvili, the Georgian foreign minister.Russian officials denied the accusation, which has made the already strained relations between Russia and Georgia, a former Soviet republic, even more tense.Mr. Bezhuashvili said radar and witnesses indicated that two Su-type Russian warplanes entered Georgian airspace on Monday and fired a one-ton guided missile at the town of Tsitelubani, about 35 miles from Tbilisi, the capital.The missile burrowed into a field of corn and potatoes and did not explode, Reuters reported.“This was a provocation aimed only at one thing, at disrupting the peace in Georgia, which would cause panic in society and ultimately change the political course of the country,” Georgia’s pro-Western president, Mikheil Saakashvili, said at the site, The Associated Press reported.'"
"'07-08-08,'1','“Progress has been slow, too slow,” he said in a news conference outside the road to the mine, about 12 miles west of Huntington in the Manti-La Sal National Forest and roughly 130 miles south-southeast of Salt Lake City.Some things about what happened in the mine were known — where the men were, for example, just after 2:45 a.m. on Monday, operating a machine called a continuous miner that paws the coal face.Some things could be reasonably predicted or deduced.If the men are alive, said Allyn Davis, the district manager of the federal Mine Safety and Health Administration, training would have kicked in and they would now probably be huddled together in total darkness to save energy in their headlamps. They would know a rescue effort was being mounted, and they would know to respond with as much noise as they could if a signal were to get through.Additional emergency supplies, including water and oxygen tanks, were added in the mine after the Sago Mine accident that killed 12 miners last year in West Virginia. The mine was also fully wired for radio, a spokesman for the company said, but all the lines were cut in the collapse.Still, plenty of room is left for assertion, speculation and spin over questions of cause and blame.Scientists at the University of Utah had initially reported the Crandall Canyon event as a 3.9-magnitude earthquake but have said since that the pattern was more consistent with a structural collapse inside the mine.Computer models that suggest earthquake epicenters are approximate, and mining activity was within the margin of error, said Relu Burlacu, a seismologist at the university. Perhaps even more important, Mr. Burlacu said, a naturally occurring quake would probably have produced two seismic spikes — an initial one followed by the resulting mine collapse. Only one spike was recorded.At a sometimes belligerent news conference on Tuesday morning, Mr. Murray flatly declared that only a naturally occurring earthquake could have possibly caused the collapse. Mines produce bumps and shakes all the time, he said, as geological stresses equalize, and some are powerful enough to lift heavy equipment off its wheels. But none ever last four minutes, as Monday’s tremor was recorded, and no mine operations, he said, could have caused it.“There is no blame,” said Mr. Murray, who also took time to attack critics of his company, the Murray Energy Corporation, including United Mine Workers leaders who he said would like to organize workers at the nonunion Crandall Canyon Mine. “It was a natural disaster.”According to the federal mine safety agency, Crandall Canyon has a mixed safety record, but not a terrible one.Federal inspectors have issued 324 violations since 2004, resulting in fines of more than $130,000. Of those violations, 107 were considered “significant and substantial,” an agency spokesman said, including one, issued on July 17 that noted inadequacies concerning the mine’s escape passages.Still, mine experts said the number of violations was not abnormal in an industry where mines are subject to stringent investigations every year.“It’s not an insignificant number, but neither is it a huge number,” said Davitt McAteer, a former assistant secretary of labor who led the mine safety agency from 1994 to 2000. “You can’t look at this and say the mine had a terrible tragic record, but you also have to say that there are some significant and substantial violations, and those have to be taken seriously.”Larry Grayson, a professor of energy and mineral engineering at Pennsylvania State University, said mines were like small cities, with water, safety and ventilation systems, any one of which could produce blemishes on a record.“I’m not saying the violations are good, and they need to be addressed,” Professor Grayson said. “But this does not seem to indicate that this was an unsafe or a bad mine.”To Peggy Kremers, 36, an office manager at Stewart’s Market in Castle Dale, about 10 miles south of here, it is not the waiting that is the worst thing. When families are hanging on every official pronouncement, she said, misinformation and speculation — people saying what they cannot be sure about — can compound everything.Ms. Kremers was a teenager in 1984 when her brother died in a fire at the Wilberg Mine near Castle Dale, along with 26 other workers. She said she hated how rumors flowed through the community about who was missing or found.She said she saw the same phenomenon on Monday with Murray Energy’s early certainty that the miners were alive and had oxygen. Mr. Murray later said he was not so sure. No communication has been possible since the collapse.“I wish they would say, ‘It’s possible they have oxygen,’ not, ‘We know they have oxygen,’ ” Ms. Kremers said. “They don’t know. They don’t know anything.”'"

During the school break in February 2006, Ms. Tamayo invited the friend to conduct the ceremony and urged an assistant principal to attend and pay $900, the report said.'"
"'07-08-08,'1','The insurance broker Marsh & McLennan posted second-quarter earnings that missed analysts’ estimates and warned of continued weakness in its core brokerage unit, sending its shares down yesterday.But the chief executive, Michael G. Cherkasky, vowed in an interview that the world’s largest insurance broker would see improvement by the fourth quarter, and “14 to 16 percent earnings-per-share growth in 2008 and 2009.”Analysts said Mr. Cherkasky had set a high hurdle, given the weakness in business insurance rates. Brokers collect fees based on how much insurers charge, and premium rates for some commercial insurance are down 50 percent.“The profit margins are very weak in Marsh’s larger accounts,” said Bill Bergman, an analyst with Morningstar, “weaker than a lot of people expected.”The shares might have dropped further had it not announced a $1.5 billion share buyback, which raises the total stock buyback for the year to $2 billion.Marsh & McLennan just realized $2.5 billion from the sale of its Putnam investment unit, which Mr. Cherkasky had originally said he would use for acquisitions.'"
"'07-08-08,'1','Glycerol is used in a variety of products, including foods, soap and dynamite. But as biodiesel fuel production in the United States has risen, the market for glycerol has become saturated.If scientists like Mr. Holser, who works at the United States Department of Agriculture’s research center in Athens, Ga., and Mr. Vaughn, who works at the department’s National Center for Agricultural Utilization Research in Peoria, Ill., can expand the number of valuable uses for the syrupy liquid, biodiesel makers could sell their glycerol instead of paying someone to haul it away.“Every week I get at least one or two calls from biodiesel producers who have all this glycerol and don’t know what to do with it,” Mr. Holser said.Glycerol, also called glycerin, is not the only byproduct of biofuel production that is the subject of experiments. Scientists are also looking at profiting from the leftovers from the production of corn ethanol and cellulosic ethanol, made from materials like switch grass, corn husks and prairie grass. Around the country, scientists, entrepreneurs and venture capitalists are becoming increasingly interested in making more than fuel out of the raw materials for biodiesel fuel and ethanol.“The opportunity, as we think about increasing our consumption of biologically derived fuels, is to consider what besides fuels can we make,” said Erik Straser, general partner of MDV Mohr Davidow Ventures, a venture capital firm in Menlo Park, Calif.Some researchers, like Mr. Holser, are simply trying to find new uses for the regular byproducts of biofuels: distillers’ dry grain from corn ethanol and lignin from cellulosic ethanol.Other researchers are trying to develop technologies and processes that could yield different, more valuable byproducts. And still others are placing their bets on “biorefineries.”In the foothills of the Rocky Mountains, not far from the Coors brewery in Golden, Colo., PureVision Technology is making lignin. A natural compound that helps provide strength and rigidity in plants, lignin makes up 15 to 25 percent of most plants.Most plans for cellulosic ethanol processing call for burning the lignin to generate steam and heat to run the process. As a fuel, lignin is worth around $40 a ton.PureVision has devised a way to make a different form of lignin — one with a molecular composition that could make it an attractive material for a variety of industrial products like glues, sealants and detergents.Ed Lehrburger, PureVision’s founder and chief executive, said he thought his lignin could sell for $300 a ton or more. Mr. Lehrburger said his company was collaborating with a wood and paper products manufacturer that is interested in using the lignin for a biobased glue for its laminates, plywoods and other products.“Lignin is going to be one of the big drivers of the switch from oil-based to biobased products,” Mr. Lehrburger predicted.In Ames, Iowa, Victor Lin has created a technology that changes the production process for biodiesel. Among other attributes, Mr. Lin’s invention yields a higher quality form of glycerol, which could be more easily converted into useful industrial materials. A chemistry professor and the associate director of the Center for Catalysis at Iowa State University, Mr. Lin is also the founder of a company, Catilin, which is backed by an initial $3 million in venture financing from MDV.The production of biodiesel fuel requires a catalyst. Mr. Lin created a catalyst that is safer and easier to use than the one commonly used now, reducing the cost of producing biodiesel and its impact on the environment (requiring less water, for instance).Dr. Lin and his colleagues are trying to turn the resulting glycerol into a substance called 1,3 propanediol, or PDO, the base material for a substance used in upholstery, carpets, clothing and other applications. DuPont uses PDO to make its Sorona line of fabrics.“For every gallon of biodiesel you make, you make a pound of glycerol,” said George Kraus, a professor of chemistry at Iowa State, where he is director of the Center for Catalysis and a collaborator of Mr. Lin. “A lot of people have been contacting us about burning it, and we say there have to be better uses.”The price of glycerol, now 20 to 50 cents a pound, could drop as low as 5 cents a pound as biodiesel production increases.Mr. Kraus said the higher quality glycerol made with the new process could command a much higher price. “What we see,” he said, “is an opportunity to make something that might cost 80 cents a pound.”In another lab at Iowa State, Robert C. Brown is using distillers’ dry grain —a main byproduct of corn ethanol that is largely sold as animal feed — to produce hydrogen and a compound called PHA. Mr. Brown hopes his version of PHA, which is biodegradable, could be used for surgical gowns and gloves that must now be disposed of as medical waste.“Critics of corn ethanol like to say the process isn’t very efficient,” Mr. Brown said. “Part of that is because your products aren’t just fuel.” Finding other high-value applications, he added, lets producers “justly say, this is not a waste stream; it adds to the profitability of the plant.“Back in Peoria, Mr. Vaughn is also looking at making products from distillers’ dry grain, including another biofuel. The grain is more than 10 percent oil, and one ton of it can yield 30 gallons of biodiesel.Interest in the biorefinery model is not limited to research scientists and start-up companies. Archer Daniels Midland is expanding some of its wet mill plants, which already churn out ethanol and a variety of other corn-based materials like high-fructose corn syrup, amino acids and sorbitol, to make industrial products. It has begun making propylene glycol, a widely used compound, from glycerol.“As petroleum prices increase and we try to become more independent with regard to energy and petroleum in general,” said Mark Matlock, senior vice president for research at the company, which is based in Decatur, Ill., “there are other opportunities that come up for industrial chemicals as well as fuels.”But despite the many uses for byproducts, the biorefinery model is more difficult than it may seem. “The dream is the multiproduct biorefinery,” said Jim McMillan, manager of biorefining process research and development at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory in Golden, Colo. “The challenge is that the market for the fuels is like two orders of magnitude bigger than for even a fairly big chemical” that could be produced alongside the fuel.'"
"'07-08-08,'1','LOS ANGELES, Aug. 7 — An American missing in Mexico for nearly three months after being wrongfully deported has been found and reunited with his family here.The man, Pedro Guzman, 29, was taken into custody on Sunday at the border crossing in Calexico, Calif., as he tried to enter the United States, said Mark D. Rosenbaum, legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Southern California, which has represented the family.Mr. Guzman, appearing exhausted and confused, did not offer much information on where he had been, Mr. Rosenbaum said. Relatives have said he is mildly developmentally disabled. State Department officials said the family had told them that he had no mental incapacity.The A.C.L.U. released a statement saying Mr. Guzman told family members on Tuesday that he had walked from Tijuana, Mexico, to Mexicali, across from Calexico, a distance of some 100 miles, and ate out of trash cans.A spokeswoman for Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Lori Haley, declined to comment, because the family was suing the government. The agency has said it followed proper procedure in deporting Mr. Guzman.Mr. Guzman had served about 20 days of a jail sentence for misdemeanor trespassing and vandalism until May 11, when, in a screening of inmates’ status, he apparently indicated he was from Mexico and was turned over to the immigration agency, which deported him to Tijuana.'"
"'07-08-08,'1','BEIJING, Aug. 7 — Human rights groups on Tuesday accused China of failing to improve its record on civil liberties, and of harassing lawyers, dissidents and journalists, despite official promises to make human rights a centerpiece of the 2008 Olympics in Beijing.Meanwhile, a group of Chinese scholars, journalists and lawyers wrote an open letter to President Hu Jintao and other national leaders calling for the release of political prisoners, including jailed Chinese reporters and inmates convicted on religious grounds. The group wrote that China’s Olympic slogan, “One World, One Dream” should instead be “One World, One Dream, and Universal Human Rights.”The criticism came from groups like Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, and journalism advocacy organizations, and foreshadowed how China’s human rights record is likely to come under growing scrutiny as the Olympics approach.The timing is hardly a coincidence. Wednesday is the start of the one-year countdown to the Olympic opening ceremony, and a public relations battle has erupted between Beijing officials, who are planning a major celebration, and advocacy groups that want to use the milestone to attract attention to their causes.“Unless the Chinese authorities take urgent measures to stop human rights violations over the coming year, they risk tarnishing the image of China and the legacy of the Beijing Olympics,” said Irene Khan, secretary general of Amnesty International.'"

According to Nielsen’s estimates, the “Singing Bee” game show delivered 7.8 million viewers at 8, down from its recent average on Tuesdays at 9:30 but enough to make “Bee” No. 1 in the hour, just ahead of ABC’s “Wife Swap” (6.4 million). After it, NBC’s finale of “Age of Love” drew a series-best 7 million viewers in second place at 9. Fox came in first in the highly competitive time slot with “Hell’s Kitchen,” which drew 8.7 million viewers and the night’s top ratings in the 18-to-49 demographic. Also at 9, the debut of ABC’s “Fat March” attracted 4.4 million viewers in fourth place. ABC and CBS tied for third behind Fox and NBC in the 18 to 49 set. On Saturday 5.8 million viewers tuned in at 8 for Nickelodeon’s “Drake & Josh: Really Big Shrimp,” the largest audience for a made-for-television movie in the channel’s history.

Mr. Doherty, 28, the lead singer of Babyshambles, appeared in West London Magistrates’ Court, where Judge Davinder Lachlar said: “If he does not show his motivation, it’s prison, as simple as that. Depending on what information I have when you next come to court, the decision will be made.” Mr. Doherty has admitted possessing crack cocaine, heroin, marijuana and ketamine, as well as two driving offenses. Judges previously ordered him to take part in a detoxification program, but a review yesterday of his progress found he had since tested positive for drugs. A hearing was scheduled for Sept. 4.A Congolese student has initiated legal action in Belgium to have the 1931 comic book “Tintin in the Congo” declared racist and removed from bookstores, Reuters reported. “It’s racist, and it is filled with colonial-era propaganda,” said the student, Mbutu Mondondo Bienvenu, who lives in Brussels. He is also seeking symbolic damages of one euro ($1.38) from Moulinsart, a company that owns the rights to Tintin but does not publish the comic. Belgian prosecutors said a judge’s decision on proceeding with Mr. Bienvenu’s motion could take six months. A spokesman for Moulinsart said: “The book dates back to 1931 and has to be seen in the context of the time. We are surprised to see this complaint after so many years.” Some stores in Britain and the United States have moved the book from their children’s shelves to the space for adult graphic novels.

"'07-08-09,'0','ROME, Aug. 9 — The Vatican worked to distance itself Thursday from a brief meeting between Pope Benedict XVI and a Polish priest accused of making anti-Semitic statements, in the latest of several tense episodes recently between Jews and Catholics.In a one-sentence statement, the Vatican suggested that the meeting consisted only of a “kiss of the hand” and that it did not “imply any change in the well known position of the Holy See and the relations between Catholics and Jews.”For days, Jewish groups in Europe and the United States have strongly denounced the pope’s meeting with the Rev. Tadeusz Rydzyk, head of Radio Maryja, which has angered not only Jews but the Vatican for broadcasts considered anti-Semitic. The meeting took place on Sunday at the pope’s summer resident, at Castelgandolfo outside of Rome, after his traditional Sunday public blessing.Earlier statements from the Vatican suggested that the pope had merely greeted several pilgrims at the audience, Father Rydzyk among them, and that the meeting was “without special significance.” In Poland, however, the radio station’s daily newspaper, Nasz Dziennik, printed photographs of the meeting, saying that the pope “blessed Radio Maryja and its work.”The Vatican statement did not address the paper’s claims, nor did it meet demands from Jewish groups that the pope specifically denounce statements on Radio Maryja that they consider anti-Semitic.'"
"'07-08-09,'0','In step with British government officials, Mr. Kendall urged his members to remain vigilant, and to report suspicious ailments in livestock immediately.The third affected farm was found today; it is in Surrey, within a few miles of the first two, where the disease was found on Aug. 3 and Aug. 7, as well as the pair of veterinary laboratories that officials say were probably the source of the virus.The British Health Protection Agency made another announcement about those laboratories today: that a worker at the government-run half, the Institute of Animal Health, had Legionnaires’ disease.The agency said it believed that the affected worker caught the illness before the foot-and-mouth outbreak. It was not clear from its statement what link, if any, there might be between the worker’s condition, which is caused by bacteria, and the release of the livestock virus. The agency said its investigators were looking at the places the worker visited in the two weeks before falling ill.At the farm where foot-and-mouth disease was found today, the country’s chief veterinary officer, Debby Reynolds, ordered more than 300 animals killed. “I cannot rule out that disease is developing on the premises,” which is quite close to the laboratory complex, she said.Inspectors were continuing their search of the laboratory complex, which the government research institute shares with a commercial vaccine-production operation, to see how the foot-and-mouth virus could have escaped into the surrounding countryside.On Tuesday, a report by the Health and Safety Executive, which had been ordered to inspect the laboratory complex by Prime Minister Gordon Brown, said there was a “strong probability” that the outbreak began at the site.The report did not say whether the government-run laboratory or the commercial operation, run by Merial Animal Health, a subsidiary of the American drug maker Merck & Co. — was the source of the virus that infected the cattle.Both have issued statements saying they had no evidence of breaches in their biological security procedures.'"

"'07-08-09,'0','From time to time, the American Red Cross sold products bearing the symbol as fund-raising efforts. Jeffrey J. Leebaw, a spokesman for Johnson & Johnson, said the company had no objection to that.But in 2004, the American Red Cross began licensing the symbol to commercial partners selling products at retail establishments. According to the lawsuit, those products include humidifiers, medical examination gloves, nail clippers, combs and toothbrushes.“What we’re talking about here is their deviation from a longstanding partnership and collaboration around the use of this trademark and their push to commercialize this trademark in the for-profit arena,” Mr. Leebaw said. “We deeply regret that it has become necessary to file this complaint. The company has the highest regard for the American Red Cross and its mission.”Mr. Leebaw added that the company had contributed more than $5 million to the American Red Cross in the last three years.John T. Crisan, general counsel for Johnson & Johnson’s consumer products division, said in an interview last night that the company had met with the American Red Cross to try to resolve the dispute.Mr. Crisan said it was not clear how far the American Red Cross wanted to go in licensing the symbol for commercial purposes, noting that the red cross was a trademark of Johnson & Johnson before the American Red Cross was officially chartered. Mr. Crisan said that some of the items being sold under licensing agreements by the American Red Cross seemed to compete directly with products sold by J.& J.Mr. Everson said that the items the American Red Cross was licensing for retail sale include emergency preparedness kits and grooming kits. The nonprofit organizations get part of the revenue from sales of those products, amounting to what he estimated was less than $10 million a year.“It’s consistent with our mission,” he said. “People will buy disaster kits, sometimes on an impulse basis. That American Red Cross image on there gives them the confidence that there are the right things in the kit. We think they’re all done with that preparedness theme.”The lawsuit filed yesterday says that Johnson & Johnson has used the red cross symbol since 1887 on a wide range of products, including wound care products and first-aid kits, which include gloves, wipes, bandages and cream.The company entered into an agreement with the American Red Cross in 1895. The agreement acknowledged Johnson & Johnson’s exclusive right to the red cross as a “trademark for chemical, surgical and pharmaceutical goods of every description,” according to the lawsuitThe lawsuit says that the American Red Cross has the right under a Congressional charter awarded in 1900 to use the red cross design in connection with its efforts to provide voluntary relief. “Carrying out a commercial enterprise or business is not and never has been one of the purposes of the American Red Cross,” the lawsuit said.The American Red Cross licensees include Learning Curve, which sells first-aid kits at Target and other retailers; Water-Jel Technologies, which places the cross on a hand sanitizer product; and Magla, which uses the cross on medical examination gloves, according to the lawsuit, which named several licensees as defendants.Johnson & Johnson, based in New Brunswick, N.J., asked in the lawsuit that all the goods be destroyed and that all profits from the goods, along with costs and punitive damages, be awarded to Johnson & Johnson.“The Red Cross products that J.& J. wants to take away from consumers and have destroyed are those that help Americans get prepared for life’s emergencies,” Mr. Everson said. “I hope that the courts and Congress will not allow Johnson & Johnson to bully the American Red Cross.”'"
"'07-08-09,'0','He added: “If you’re in a pub talking about great sports events you’ve attended, and you say you caught Bonds’s record-breaking home run, all attention turns to you. It gives you a direct connection to history.”Sal Durante is part of a small club of fans who know the feeling. Durante is forever linked to Roger Maris after catching his 61st home run in 1961. Maris urged Durante, then a 19-year-old Brooklyn teenager, to sell the ball to Sam Gordon, a Sacramento restaurateur who vowed in advance that he would pay $5,000 for the ball that broke Babe Ruth’s single-season home run record.“I knew about it, but I wasn’t thinking about it,” Durante said of the bounty yesterday from Staten Island. “I wanted a ball, batting practice or whatever.” He jumped onto his seat — Box 163 D in Section 33 — and caught the ball in one hand, then fell into a heap of treasure seekers.Philip Ozersky, a researcher at the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, grabbed Mark McGwire’s 70th home run after it ricocheted off the hands of two co-workers in a party suite at Busch Stadium.“I landed on it, people landed on me, but they weren’t biting me or punching me,” he said yesterday in a telephone interview. “I knew them. They were my friends and they poured beer on me.”The $5,000 windfall helped Durante pay his parents’ debts and set up his first home with his fiancée, whom he married four weeks after the home run. But it did not dramatically alter his life. Until his retirement last year, he had driven a school bus for 27 years.Hayashi’s $225,000 split from selling the Bonds ball went for lawyers’ fees and to pay for his master’s degree.Selling the McGwire ball for $2.7 million gave Ozersky the resources to buy three houses, go to a Super Bowl and give $250,000 to charities.Hayashi said the joy of being momentarily part of history was diminished slightly by being sued by Alex Popov, who claimed that Bonds’s 73rd home run ball was his. The dispute likely reduced the value of the ball, and legal fees ate into Hayashi’s proceeds. “I went to a baseball game,” he said. “I went to witness history, and unbeknownst to me, all this other stuff happened, some good and some bad.”Durante advised Murphy to “hold his composure and not have an attitude. Just be an all-around honest guy and don’t come across cocky.”Murphy has already taken one step in that direction, telling The Daily News that he would give the friend who accompanied him to the game 49 percent of what the ball sells for, which could be as much as $500,000. Murphy and his friend, on their way to a vacation in Australia, bought their tickets to the game three weeks earlier, when they realized they would have a layover in San Francisco, he told the News.If Durante’s $5,000 reward sounds meager — remember the memorabilia age was about a quarter century from flowering — consider the ball hit by Ruth on Sept. 30, 1927. It was caught by Joe Forner, who was described in The New York Times as a fan of baseball for 35 of his 40 years.According to The Times, as soon as the game ended, “Forner rushed over to the dressing room to let the Babe know who had the ball.”Three days later, Forner received $100 from Truly Warner, the owner of a chain of New York hat shops. And 78 years later, a photograph of the formal-looking transaction between Forner, lean with a full head of hair, and Warner, with hats on his desk, was auctioned by Lelands for $390.98.'"
"'07-08-09,'0','Mr. Bezhuashvili said he hoped to set up an international panel. “We have a body of evidence,” he said by telephone. “There is a common understanding of the seriousness of the situation, and we are initiating a process of calling for a special session of the U.N. Security Council.”In March, a guided missile and a barrage of unguided rockets struck remote villages late at night in the Kodori Gorge, the only area of the Russian-backed separatist region of Abkhazia that is under Georgian control. More than 50 witnesses reported the sound of helicopters, which Georgia said flew in from a Russian base.Russia denied involvement in that attack, although United Nations investigators issued a report this summer that strongly suggested a Russian role. It fell short of directly accusing Russia, in part because Russia did not cooperate fully with investigators and there was no radar record available.The latest missile, however, was from an aircraft that flew near a main highway outside Tbilisi, an area with radar coverage.Georgia said it had collected radar records from both its civilian and military air traffic controllers that clearly show an aircraft enter from Russia, fly to the area of the strike, then turn around and fly back into Russia.Georgia also released audio recordings and a transcript of an apparently frustrated Georgian air traffic controller. The controller was talking with his counterpart in southwestern Russia, asking about an unscheduled flight along the border that he was seeing on his screen, the Georgian government said.The Russian controller checked with his supervisor, according to the recording, which was released to journalists. He then told the Georgian controller that no planes were flying.“Our bosses said that nobody is there, neither by plan nor in reality,” the Russian said.“Well, O.K., it might be a U.F.O.,” the Georgian answered.Georgia has long accused Russia of conducting military flights across the border; Mr. Bezhuashvili said there were multiple incursions on Saturday and Sunday. He added that a tepid international response to the incursions, and the limited response to the attack in the Kodori Gorge in March, had emboldened Russia.The Kremlin, which continues to wage a counterinsurgency campaign against Chechen separatists and Islamic militants in the north Caucasus, backs secular separatists in Abkhazia and South Ossetia, the two breakaway regions over the border in Georgia. It has tried to portray the region as peaceful, and will be the host of the 2014 Winter Olympics not far away, in Sochi.No motive for the missile firing was immediately clear. But Shota Utiashvili, the head of the analysis department for Georgia’s Interior Ministry, said the plane might have released the missile after taking fire from Ossetian separatists on the ground.On Tuesday, the commander of Russian peacekeepers in South Ossetia said on Russian national television that the Ossetians had fired at a plane, apparently thinking it was Georgian.Because the missile did not explode, many of the fragments were recovered.Georgia, which briefed foreign diplomats, said the remains made clear that the missile was an AS-Kilter, a guided missile nearly 16 feet long that was designed in Soviet times to destroy NATO radar installations.The missile can carry an explosive charge of more than 300 pounds. Georgia said it had neither AS-11 Kilter missiles nor aircraft that can fire them.'"
"'07-08-09,'0','Even now, such suspicions show no sign of abating. Many other Muslim institutions have been named in the suit, and last month Mariane Pearl, the wife of the slain Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl, sued Habib Bank, the largest bank in Pakistan, accusing it of providing banking services to charities that supported terrorist organizations. For the prince, his legal difficulties and a growing resentment of United States policies in the Middle East have put a strain on what traditionally has been a robust business relationship.“There has been a cloud on relations,” said Richard A. Debs, an advisory director at Morgan Stanley and vice chairman of the United States-Saudi Arabian Business Council. “There is disaffection — people think Prince Muhammad has been unfairly persecuted and attacked. I just don’t see the connection between Islamic finance and Islamic extremism.”In the case of DMI, others are not so sure. This year, the Justice Department’s counterterrorism division disclosed that it was investigating whether clients of a DMI subsidiary, via a private equity fund once owned by DMI, avoided paying their share of taxes.In their complaint, lawyers for Sept. 11 relatives argue that the early alliances formed by the prince with conservative political and religious figures in Sudan and Egypt as well as the banking services DMI has provided to people and organizations who would be declared terrorists after Sept. 11 are proof that the prince and the trust have “conspired with Al Qaeda and the other defendants to carry out terrorist attacks.”A lawyer representing DMI, James J. McGuire, denies any such intent. “The fact that DMI unknowingly had an account with someone who was later deemed a terrorist is hardly evidence that the bank is involved in terrorism,” Mr. McGuire said.To support their case, investigators for the plaintiffs have gathered documents that show that Wael Jelaidan, a suspected founder of Al Qaeda who was designated a terrorist by the United States government in September 2002, maintained an account at Faisal Finance, DMI’s Swiss banking unit, from January 1997 to July 2003 that grew to be as large as $405,000. Mr. Jelaidan, through his lawyer, Martin F. McMahon, has denied links to terrorist organizations.An even more significant client of Faisal Finance — now called Faisal Private Bank — was Yassin Abdullah Kadi, a prominent Saudi businessman and a past shareholder of DMI who was designated a terrorist in October 2001 for his ties to Islamic charities accused of providing financial support to terrorists. Bank records from Faisal Finance show transactions by Mr. Kadi as late as February 2003, more than a year after his designation. Mr. Kadi has denied that he has ever supported terrorist organizations and he is contesting his designation.Other documents collected by plaintiffs show that two extremist groups in Pakistan that have been designated by the United States for their support of terrorism maintained deposit accounts at Faysal Bank Ltd., DMI’s banking affiliate there. One is Lashkar-e-tayyiba, an armed group fighting India in the disputed region of Kashmir, and another, Lajnat al-Dawa, is a Kuwait-based foundation that has links to Al Qaeda, according to the United States Treasury’s Web site.According to Mr. McGuire, DMI’s lawyer, the accounts were frozen as soon as the clients had been either put on a designated list or banned in Pakistan. The accounts of Mr. Kadi and Mr. Jelaidan are active only to the extent that investment payouts are recorded and fees are paid to Faisal, he said.The complaint also focuses on the ties Prince Muhammad had with religious personalities like Hassan al-Turabi from Sudan, who was a supervisory director of the trust from 1982 to 1992, and Yusuf al-Qaradawi, who was an early religious adviser to the trust until he left in 1994.Mr. Turabi was a once-powerful political figure in Sudan who welcomed Osama bin Laden to the country in 1991. Faisal Islamic Bank in Sudan, a past affiliate of the trust, was a major financial sponsor of Mr. Turabi, the complaint contends. And Mr. Qaradawi, a prominent Islamic scholar from Egypt, has been linked to the Muslim Brotherhood, although he did condemn the Sept. 11 attacks.Finally, the complaint highlights some fiery language used by Prince Muhammad in a 1984 letter to shareholders in which he says, “May Allah bless your jihad and all your efforts.”Michael E. Elsner, a lawyer representing the Sept. 11 relatives, said that it is the mix of these pieces of evidence that underpins the case. And even if DMI has now cut ties and frozen accounts, he said that having such people on the board and providing financial services to businessmen who would be designated as terrorists are signs of DMI’s sympathy toward Islamic extremism.“All this creates a picture that DMI provided material support to Al Qaeda,” he said. “And if the accounts are frozen, why are they accepting investment payouts?”But Khalid Abdullah Janahi, the chief executive of DMI since 1998, who has overseen a period of substantial growth for the company as the market for Islamic finance has boomed, sees something more insidious at work: latent prejudice, compounded by a broader bias he has encountered since Sept. 11.“Suddenly the hatred of the petrodollar days is back,” he said. A gruff, burly man who was a partner at Price Waterhouse before coming to DMI, his voice rises as he explains that jihad can also mean a nonviolent struggle for a pure, legitimate end. He added: “Rarely in the Western media do I read anything about our food, our culture, our painting or our poetry. I just read how bad we are as Muslims.”At DMI’s administrative headquarters in a gleaming glass building on the outskirts of Geneva, the only evidence of the trust’s Saudi origin is a painting of a pensive King Faisal, the father of Prince Muhammad, which hangs in its main conference room. Mr. Janahi is dressed in a conservative suit and he takes pains to explain that Islamic finance is a global business that has attracted the likes of Goldman Sachs and HSBC to compete with DMI.Technically a trust, DMI functions as a holding company, with ownership stakes in Islamic banks in Pakistan, Egypt and Africa, investment banks in Bahrain and the Faisal private bank in Geneva. It also manages $1.5 billion for largely Muslim clients, invested exclusively in businesses and funds that are in tune with Islamic law, like real estate and private equity.Since recording a loss in 2000, its fortunes have soared as capital has flowed to the region and the trust posted a record profit of $52 million last year.Yet the specter of the lawsuit hangs over the company, and it has spent millions of dollars on legal fees. “We will take this case to the Supreme Court if need be,” Mr. Janahi said. DMI’s motion to dismiss, along with 107 similar motions from other defendants in the case, awaits a decision from Judge George B. Daniels of the Federal District Court in Manhattan.While he will not discuss specific accusations, the idea that an established entrepreneur like the prince — before DMI, he ran a venture in Jeddah that aimed, unsuccessfully, to bring icebergs to Saudi Arabia — would knowingly finance terrorism offends Mr. Janahi’s pragmatic sensibilities.“These people are all part of the system,” he said, referring to many well-known Middle Eastern businessmen named in the suit. “There is no way they are going to pay people to hang themselves.”Ibrahim A. Warde, an expert on Islamic finance at the Fletcher School at Tufts University has written a book, out this summer, called “The Price of Fear.” In it he contends that contrary to popular perception, there is no monolithic financial pool sustaining Al Qaeda — a view that is supported by the Sept. 11 Commission’s report on terrorism financing. “There is this idea that it is money that makes terror possible,” he said. “So DMI, as an Islamic bank, has a few strikes against it.”'"
"'07-08-09,'0','HAMBURG, Germany, Aug. 8 (AP) — Even though the Tour de France champion Alberto Contador said he was not likely to ride, organizers of an upcoming race said he was not welcome in their event.The lead organizer of the Pro-Tour’s Cyclassics event Aug. 19 said that the race did not want Contador because he was mentioned in connection with the Spanish blood-doping scandal known as Operation Puerto.“Our basic position is that we don’t want any rider from the Fuentes list,” Frank Bertling said Wednesday.A spokesman for Contador said Contador would make a public statement on Friday. Contador “will publicize a communique” at the offices of Spain’s Superior Council for Sports along with the Discovery Channel Team head, Johan Bruyneel, Jacinto Vidarte said Wednesday.The sports doctor Eufemiano Fuentes and seven other people were arrested in Madrid in May 2006 on suspicion of providing doping services that implicated more than 50 cyclists.'"
"'07-08-09,'0','Ms. Beyn’s business is faring better than many since, she said, her insurer has agreed to reimburse all her costs while she is closed, even lost income.But just getting to the point where a reopening could be planned was fraught with obstacles. More than $25,000 in fresh food had to be thrown out after the eruption, which sent scalding steam, mud, dust, chunks of pavement and other debris into the air. It took two weeks to complete work required by the city: a scrubbing of the deli’s interior and an inspection for asbestos, which presumably was used as insulation for the pipe, laid in 1924, that exploded.Now, having passed an inspection by the city’s Department of Environmental Protection, Old Bridge is awaiting another inspection, scheduled for today, by the health department. If that goes well, Ms. Beyn said, fresh food can be reordered and the front door opened to customers.It all costs money. The payroll expense for full- and part-time employees who are not working has reached $60,000, she said. Con Ed said it would cover the cost of food that was discarded and an additional $25,000 bill for the cleanup.But for Old Bridge, as for many other businesses reeling from the blast, there will be other costs, higher but harder to quantify.“A consumer psychology kicks in,” said Jim McKenna, chief development officer of Sophie’s Cuban Cuisine Inc., which operates a Caribbean restaurant on Lexington Avenue between 40th and 41st Streets that remains closed. “People who have been forced to find another place to eat are reluctant to come back, and that will certainly be the case as long as this street is torn up.”For companies that have been forced out of office buildings, the problem has been finding other temporary quarters.“Our new business efforts have just stopped,” said Jerry Gottlieb, the chief executive of McCaffery Ratner Gottlieb & Lane, an advertising company whose offices on the second floor of 370 Lexington Avenue, directly above the steam explosion, were badly damaged. Still unable to return, the company has found temporary space nearby at 125 Park Avenue, Mr. Gottlieb said, but only after executives spent three days reassuring clients that deadlines would be met, and teleconferencing by cellphone, from a lounge section of the Oyster Bar in Grand Central Terminal.Con Ed said 728 businesses were forced to close after the eruption; it is unclear how many are still closed or are struggling to get by, using other quarters. The utility has promised to reimburse businesses for damaged property, cleanup expenses and food that had to be discarded, but not for lost business — a cost that many business owners say will be much bigger.Mr. McGee said Con Ed was drawing the same line as government agencies that do not reimburse business losses from such things as road construction and water main breaks.But several merchants, including Ms. Beyn, are threatening to sue.The city and the federal governments are offering low- and no-interest loans to businesses hurt by the explosion, but officials said yesterday that they had not received a huge response. Kara Alaimo, a spokeswoman for the city’s Department of Small Business Services, which is offering business loans of up to $10,000 at no interest, said it had approved 14 loans and was expecting more applications. Michael Peacock, a spokesman for the federal Small Business Administration, which is offering loans of up to $1.5 million at 4 percent interest, said 42 businesses had requested applications, but none had been submitted.While Ms. Beyn said she hoped to have Old Bridge up and running within days, the situation at Sophie’s Cuban Cuisine is less positive. Mr. McKenna said it would take at least another two weeks for its restaurant to reopen. The company’s insurance may cover damage from a kitchen fire that broke out after workers fled the explosion without turning off the oven burners, he said, but it will not cover the cost of lost business.He said he would not accept reimbursement from Con Edison for about $30,000 in wasted food if it meant giving up the right to sue the utility for other damages. “They were responsible, and I am not signing a waiver,” he said.'"
"'07-08-09,'0','A Kansas City federal judge’s order last year to suspend executions could be lifted within a week, freeing the Missouri Supreme Court to set execution dates.But if Mr. Taylor asks, and the appeals court agrees, the moratorium could continue while the United States Supreme Court decides whether to hear his case.Brian Hauswirth, a State Corrections Department spokesman, called the appeals court’s decision “another step toward resolution of the legal challenges to lethal injection.”Mr. Taylor’s case had prompted a federal judge last year to place a moratorium on executions in Missouri. The judge, Fernando Gaitan Jr. of Federal District Court, said he wanted to be sure that the three-drug injection method did not cause risk of pain and suffering.Judge Gaitan wanted the state to involve a doctor specializing in anesthesia, but the state has been unable to find such a doctor willing to participate.The three-judge appeals panel on June 4 reversed Judge Gaitan’s ruling, saying the state’s execution protocol “is designed to ensure a quick, indeed a painless, death.”Mr. Taylor’s lawyer argued that the panel focused too narrowly on the protocol rather than how it was carried out or any accidents or mistakes by staff that might result.Days after the June ruling opened the way for restarting executions in Missouri, the state’s attorney general, Jay Nixon, asked the State Supreme Court to set execution dates for 10 condemned inmates, more than one-fifth of the state’s 44 death row inmates.The debate centers on the three drugs used in executions. The argument is that if the initial anesthetic does not take hold, a third drug that stops the heart can be excruciatingly painful. But the inmate would not be able to communicate the pain because of a second drug that paralyzes him.Missouri is among several states that has suspended executions as they consider whether lethal injection is inhumane.Mr. Taylor was convicted of killing a 15-year-old girl in 1989 after kidnapping her from a school bus stop. He was hours from execution in 2006 when the procedure was halted.Missouri has not executed an inmate since October.'"
"'07-08-09,'0','According to the indictments in the case and to investigations conducted by Refco, Mr. Bennett had been hiding hundreds of millions of dollars in losses at Refco for many years, showing instead that the company was owed the money by outsiders. Mr. Bennett and two other former Refco executives are scheduled to go on trial on March 17. The Lee company and funds that it managed took control of Refco in a leveraged buyout in 2004. The suit does not maintain that Lee executives knew of the fraud, but does argue that they knew of numerous problems at Refco and had evidence that Mr. Bennett had lied to them, well before the public offering.It states that after an informant told Mr. Lee that Refco had transferred losses to a foreign subsidiary in the 1990s to hide the losses, the accounting firm KPMG, which was advising Thomas H. Lee, suggested an audit that would have uncovered the fraud.But Mr. Lee instead accepted Mr. Bennett’s assurances that the transfers had been done for tax reasons and were not relevant to the firm’s current condition.Through dividends and proceeds from the offering, the Lee defendants recovered $162.5 million and obtained another $113 million from management contracts, the suit states.In an interview, Marc S. Kirschner, the trustee of the Refco Liquidation Trust, said he expected to file additional suits, but would not name defendants.“There were a number of red flags that the Lee folks ignored,” he said. “They learned of significant problems at Refco, which they basically ignored in the rush to go public.”The suit was filed two weeks after the Lee operations filed their own suit, against the law firm that represented Refco before the buyout, Mayer, Brown, Rowe & Maw.That suit said that lawyers from Mayer, Brown were involved in the transactions that hid the fraud and should have disclosed them.Yesterday, the Lee spokesman said the private equity firm intended to sue Grant Thornton, Refco’s former auditors, “and are actively evaluating potential claims against other responsible parties.”The suit filed yesterday paints a picture of Thomas H. Lee as a firm that had learned that Refco was a mess, with its accounting in disarray and significant evidence that it had illegally used customer funds.“Rather than fix the problems at Refco, the T.H.L. defendants made a conscious choice to bury those problems,” the suit stated, adding that they “operated Refco with a singular goal of getting a payday for themselves as quickly as possible.”The suit also claimed that the Lee companies were in a hurry because they were raising a new private equity fund and believed that a quick profit at Refco would help to “create a favorable track record for marketing purposes.”Correction: August 11, 2007  An article and headline in Business Day on Thursday about a suit involving the collapse of the commodities firm Refco, and the High & Low Finance column on Friday about the same subject, referred incorrectly to both the defendants and the plaintiff in the suit. As the article described, the suit was filed by the trustee of the Refco Liquidation Trust, which represents creditors of Refco. He is not the Refco bankruptcy trustee, as the headline said, nor is he the trustee of the company, as the first paragraph said. The article and the column should have pointed out that the Thomas H. Lee Partners and partnerships run by that firm, which are defendants in the suit, are no longer controlled by Thomas H. Lee, who severed his ties with the firm in 2006. Mr. Lee is named as a defendant because of his role as a director of Refco, and the suit names several other former directors who were not identified in the article. The article and column also misstated certain allegations in the lawsuit. The suit stated that representatives of the Lee companies, not Mr. Lee himself, had failed to thoroughly investigate allegations of irregularities before the Lee companies took control of Refco, and had failed to disclose their knowledge of problems at the company before it went public in 2005.'"
"'07-08-09,'0','BY now, most Americans know the story of Cpl. Pat Tillman. He bravely chose military service rather than the National Football League, and he was killed in Afghanistan in 2004 by fire from his comrades.My own units in Vietnam were occasionally the victims of errant rifle fire, mortar rounds and bombs — indeed, the very success of an infantry attack is dependent on leaning forward into friendly supporting fires.But, after the fact, the Tillman death played out differently. His unit reported that he was killed in a ferocious engagement with the enemy, and the truth was hidden by the chain of command until, as is almost always the case, the truth escaped. As has been proved repeatedly, bad news doesn’t get any better with age. Lt. Gen. Philip R. Kensinger Jr., who was responsible for the cover-up, has been censured and faces demotion.Sadly, Corporal Tillman’s death comes with another unhappy legacy: a ludicrous change in the Army regulation that deals with reporting casualties. With this change, the Army now requires a formal, independent investigation into the death of every American in a hostile area.If this provision had been in place when we began our operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, there would have been about 3,700 investigations by now. The American losses in Vietnam would have required more than 58,000 inquiries. And if the regulation had existed in World War II, we would have conducted 400,000 investigations, requiring perhaps as many investigating officers as we now have troops in Iraq.'"
"'07-08-09,'0','“Price certainly plays into a product’s allure,” said Robert Burke, a retail consultant in New York. “For certain people, the higher the price, the more attractive the item becomes.”An exorbitant price can confer exclusivity. “People are willing to pay a significant amount of money to make sure they don’t see their purchase on other people,” Mr. Burke said.Or to ensure that their friends will recognize its provenance. “Price is part of the status of certain luxury items,” said Marvin Traub, a retail consultant in New York. Mr. Traub, who visited Moscow in March, noticed that people there were fascinated not by how little but how much was paid. To some extent, Mr. Traub noted, “that sort of thinking translates here, too.”Among merchants and manufacturers, consumer psychology can be as significant as economics in setting prices. “Luxury makers are not necessarily forced to raise prices above the exchange-rate factor, but sometimes they do,” said Milton Pedraza of the Luxury Institute, a research group in New York. “Why? They know that consumers are resilient. For manufacturers, it’s really about asking for a price increase because you can.”Those remarks resonate with Jeffrey Kalinsky, a specialty retailer who owns fashion emporiums in New York and Atlanta. Mr. Kalinsky, who is also the director for designer merchandizing of Nordstrom, does not pretend to speak for his customers. But he shares their sometimes-irrational passions. He recalled that as long as 20 years ago, when he was in his mid-20s, he would “just walk into a store and see a sweater, and something inside of me would say, ‘Oh, I hope I can afford it. I bet it’s at least $800.’ “That sweater would be $1,100,” Mr. Kalinsky confided, “but, miraculously, then I would want it more.”In some cases, manufacturers adjust prices upward to make sure that their goods hang in good company, displayed alongside prestigious luxury brands. “They tack on a healthy premium, because they want to maintain the exclusivity of the brand,” Mr. Pedraza said. “The customer pays for that cachet.”Susan Sokol, the president of Vera Wang, acknowledged that while it is important to maintain a range of prices within a collection, “it is extremely critical to understand price positioning and to be very strategic about it.“If I know our customer is buying Miu Miu or Dries van Noten,” she said, “we have to price accordingly.”The appetite for high-end wares has been a boon to retailers, who need to sell fewer of a given item to turn a handsome profit. The higher the price, the higher the margin, Mr. Burke pointed out: “It’s much easier to sell five of something really expensive than 20 of something less expensive.” Markups, he said, have remained much the same since last year.A stroll through several high-end stores in Manhattan this week turned up prices that might be the equivalent of a down payment on a minivan. At Jeffrey, in the meatpacking district, a raglan-sleeve black jersey Lanvin dress was $2,455, a Shawn Collins thermal knit sweater $995. Barneys offerings included a Balenciaga leather bag with fancy grommets, $1,725; Lanvin leather ballet flats, $530; and Marc Jacobs cuffed leather ankle boots, $995.At Bergdorf Goodman, a Stella McCartney turtleneck devoid of trim sells for $995, and her cable-stitched sweater for $1,495. A pair of Kieselstein-Cord sunglasses is tagged at $595. Far from daunting, such a ticket might be downright seductive to customers, Ms. Sokol said. “When you are looking at a handbag or even a pair of sunglasses, a high price can have inherent snob appeal.”Consumers tell themselves, Ms. Sokol went on, “ ‘If those glasses are $150, I’m not going to be as interested as if they are $350.’ ”That is not to say that consumers are indifferent to price. Many are making emotional adjustments, finding ways to balance a love of fashion with the reality of its increasingly exorbitant cost. Eunice Ward, a lawyer in Chicago with a taste for quirky labels like Dolce & Gabbana and Stella McCartney, pays full price only for items that resonate with her sense of style. During a recent shopping trip, she spied a Yohji Yamomoto sweater. “I knew it would fit with my wardrobe and update everything,” she said, “that it was going to be my workhorse for fall.“I didn’t even check the price at first. I knew I would love it, and I didn’t care.”At Saks Fifth Avenue in Manhattan last week, Jessica Lee darted among the racks, gazing avidly at a champagne-colored Miu Miu cocktail dress, scarcely bothering to look at its $1,250 tag. “Fashion’s gotten more expensive,” Ms. Lee said, a fact as inevitable, and untroubling, to her as the tide.“The economy is good,” said Ms. Lee, who works for a private equity firm in Manhattan. “I’ve made a lot more over the past year than before, and so I have more purchasing power.”Kate Strachan appeared to be more circumspect. As a technical designer for a fashion house, she is well acquainted with the price of style. “I know a lot of quality, craftsmanship and time goes into some of these pieces,” Ms. Strachan said.Regardless, she is determined to put a cap on her spending. Combing the racks at Saks, she sighed wistfully: “I can’t afford these kinds of things, so usually I buy what I need most. This year that would be a winter coat.”Then with a self-mocking smile she added, “Of course there are times when I’ll splurge.”'"

Forecasts ranged from a gain of 0.2 percent to 2.3 percent.The import-price index is the first of three monthly price gauges. The Labor Department's report on wholesale prices is due Aug. 14 and the consumer price index on Aug. 15. Economists forecast consumer prices rose 0.2 percent in July for a second month, according to a Bloomberg survey.Compared with a year earlier, prices of imported goods rose 2.8 percent in July after a 2 percent gain in June. Excluding petroleum, prices also increased 2.8 percent in the past 12 months.The price of imported petroleum jumped 7 percent in July, the most since March. Prices were up 4.1 percent from the same time a year earlier.Food and beverage prices climbed 1.6 percent and were up 9.8 percent in the 12 months ended July, the biggest year- over-year gain since 1995.The Fed this week kept the benchmark interest rate at 5.25 percent and acknowledged that inflation excluding food and energy appeared to be slowing.""Readings on core inflation have improved modestly in recent months,"" the Federal Open Market Committee said in its Aug. 7 announcement. Still, the committee reiterated that the ""predominant policy concern remains the risk that inflation will fail to moderate as expected.""A decline in the value of the dollar is making imports more expensive and, in turn, lowering the cost of American- made goods to overseas buyers. The dollar has fallen more than 7 percent since the beginning of last year against a trade-weighted basket of currencies of major U.S. trading partners.The cost of imported capital goods increased 0.2 percent for a second month. Prices of imported automobiles, parts and engines rose 0.1 percent.

The Labor Department revised down the June price figure to 0.9 percent from a first-reported 1.0 percent increase.The report also showed that export prices rose 0.2 percent in July after rising 0.3 percent in June. That was somewhat lower than the 0.3 percent rise economists had forecast.Foods, feeds, and beverage prices jumped 1.6 percent in July after rising 0.2 percent in June. Over the past year, prices rose 9.8 percent, the largest yearly increase since a 10.2 percent gain in May 1995.The rise in nonpetroleum import prices was driven by higher prices for finished goods, the department said.'"
"'07-08-10,'0','All three major American indexes fell immediately after the opening bell, and at one point the Dow Jones industrial average was down nearly 200 points, or 1.5 percent. By noon, stocks were on the rebound and the indexes were briefly in positive territory, then declined again.“There is no one view that is dominating,” said Liz Ann Sonders, chief investment strategist at Charles Schwab. “There are plenty of people who are on either side. I have seen a lot of people saying this is a classic buying opportunity, and I have seen plenty of people saying this is the beginning of the bear market.”Investor anxiety has been so heightened in recent weeks that days of stability have quickly been shattered by the first emergence of seemingly any and all problems tied to the debt markets. Volatility, as measured by one popular index of options trading, has surged to its highest levels in more than four years, though it remains far lower than it was early this decade and in the late 1990s.The financial sector of the market has been among the most volatile. Today it was down as much as 1.7 percent and up as much as 1.1 percent before closing little changed.Shares of Countrywide Financial, the nation’s largest mortgage lender, and Washington Mutual, the sixth biggest lender, opened sharply lower after both companies said in filings that they are facing a harder time selling loans and could have problems raising money in the future. The stocks recovered much of their losses for the day but are down significantly for the year.The Nasdaq composite index finished the day at 2,544.89, down 11.60, or 0.4 percent. With the late rally, however, all three major indexes ended the week slightly higher than they started.Earlier, stocks in Japan, Hong Kong and Australia dropped by more than 2.5 percent. The benchmark Kospi in South Korea fell 4.27 percent, the biggest decline since June 2004. Most major European indexes plunged by 3 percent or more.In both Asia and Europe, fears about the American housing market prompted investors to sell assets and commercial banks to reel in credit lines.Central banks across the globe stepped up efforts to slow the losses. The Bank of Japan added liquidity for the first time since the market problems began, while the European Central Bank injected money into the banking system for a second consecutive day.The E.C.B. injected another 61 billion euros ($84 billion) into the banking system, after providing 95 billion euros the day before. The Federal Reserve today added $19 billion to the system through the purchase of mortgage-backed securities, then another $19 billion in three-day repurchase agreements. The Fed added $24 billion on Thursday.As investors in Asia sold off assets considered relatively risky, like Philippine stocks, they bought those considered safer, like Japanese government bonds. Asian currencies like the Thai baht also retreated against the dollar and more liquid and stable currencies like the yen.“Everyone’s been talking about a credit crunch, and not surprisingly it turned into one,” said Jan Lambregts, head of Asia research at Rabobank. While Asian banks did not seem to be directly affected, he said, “the main problem is we don’t know who is bearing the losses, and that kind of uncertainty is creating the situation that we’re in right now.”Fears of a shortage of money available to banks meeting demands for funds by investors as they sold assets prompted the Fed to add $24 billion in reserves to the banking system Thursday.Responding to fears of a similar credit squeeze in Asia, the Bank of Japan said today that it added 1 trillion yen, or $8.4 billion, to money markets in Tokyo.

Exporters also declined after concerns grew that the situation might lead to higher U.S. interest rates and hurt consumer demand.The declines were touched off by news that the largest publicly owned French bank, BNP Paribas, was freezing $2.2 billion from three funds with exposure to United States subprime mortgages because panic selling had made it impossible to value the holdings.The move only heightened the market’s alarm, however, prompting the European Central Bank to announce that it had lent a record $130.6 billion to banks and would continue to provide as much money as needed as frenzied trading pushed up the rate they charged each other to its highest level since 2004.Banks, worried that their peers might face subprime exposure or be forced to follow BNP’s example, have been cutting back on their credit lines to other banks around the world.Concerns were exacerbated after the United States subprime mortgage lender NovaStar Financial announced Thursday that rising defaults had resulted in a $52.9 million second-quarter loss. The Dow Jones industrial average suffered its worst decline since February, falling roughly 3 percent, with brokerage shares suffering their worst declines since 2002.The quandary faced by central bankers was illustrated nowhere better than South Korea.

"'07-08-10,'0','LOS ANGELES, Aug. 9 — Six Democratic presidential candidates participated Thursday night in a televised forum devoted to gay issues. All voiced strong support for equal rights and government benefits for gay Americans, though the three leading candidates said they opposed same-sex marriage.With the candidates generally agreeing on the major issues at hand, the organizers of the forum chose to dig deeper into their personal attitudes and experiences. In particular they grilled former Senator John Edwards, who has expressed religious concerns about same-sex marriage and who, according to a former consultant of his, once said about gays, “I’m not comfortable around those people.”Mr. Edwards moved swiftly to deny remark. When one of the forum’s panelists, the singer Melissa Etheridge, asked if he felt “O.K. right now” in a roomful of gay people, he said with a chuckle, “I’m perfectly comfortable.”Turning serious, Mr. Edwards added: “Can I just tell you — that’s not true. Someone else said it, and it’s not true, it’s not true. It came from a political consultant, and he’s just wrong. Elizabeth and I were both there, and we’ve said it’s wrong.”The political consultant, Robert Shrum, recounted the comment in a recent book.Mr. Edwards also took the opportunity of the forum, which was organized by the Human Rights Campaign and shown on the Logo cable channel, to repudiate his past remark that his religious views had influenced his opposition to same-sex marriage.'"

"'07-08-10,'0','The founders of the institute, Jim and Virginia Stowers, had contributed $30 million to the campaign to pass the constitutional amendment.Kevin C. Eggan, an assistant professor of molecular and cellular biology at Harvard University who works with stem cells, said he had strongly considered moving to Stowers, but had delayed his plans.“Everybody hoped that Missouri was going to be a good test case,” Mr. Eggan said. “It was exciting to us that stem cell research was being voted in in a state which has very restrictive abortion laws. But it has turned out to be a big disappointment.”A few months ago, the University of Missouri, in Columbia, lost some $85 million in state money for a new research facility. University officials said the facility was not intended for stem cell research, but opponents of the research blocked the financing anyway, suggesting that the constitutional amendment would make it possible down the road.“For a bright shining moment in time, we were moving ahead as a state to protect research,” said Senator Chuck Graham, Democrat of Columbia. “But now the other side wants to walk away, not only from stem cell research, but all research. Their attitude now is, if there’s a beaker or a Petri dish involved, we’re not going to fund it.”Representative Jim Lembke, a St. Louis Republican who said he opposed the destruction of human embryos, is among those who have proposed new legislation outlawing some elements of the research.“As people are educated about this issue, they come around,” Mr. Lembke said.The ballot measure that passed last fall guarantees that any federally allowed stem cell research or treatment will also be allowed in Missouri.The question of embryonic stem cell research has usually been fought out in state legislatures, not among voters, but supporters said the Missouri legislature’s efforts to ban the research had led them to seek the statewide vote.Only in California had voters approved a comparable measure, and Missouri was seen as offering a picture of how a more socially conservative state might respond. California’s measure was approved in 2004 and included $3 billion in financing for stem cell research. Missouri’s measure included no money.Other factors made the Missouri vote of special importance. It became a central issue in a race here that would help decide the balance of power in the United States Senate — between Senator Jim Talent, the Republican incumbent, who opposed the amendment, and Claire McCaskill, his Democratic challenger, who supported it and ultimately won.Though the amendment passed, the margin of 51 percent to 49 percent, a difference of 50,800 votes (out of about 2.1 million cast), was slimmer than some had predicted. It was rejected in 97 of the state’s 114 counties, secretary of state records show, gaining most of its support in the metropolitan areas of St. Louis and Kansas City.Supporters of the amendment outspent opponents by a wide margin. Within hours of the vote, opponents said they would fight on, focusing their attention narrowly on one element of the research, known as therapeutic cloning or somatic cell nuclear transfer, in which the nucleus of a mature cell is transplanted into an egg cell, which would then produce stem cells.The debate has come down to a fight over what constitutes “cloning.”Supporters of the amendment say they banned human cloning, which they defined in the amendment as an act that could result in a woman’s pregnancy and the creation of a human fetus inside a woman’s uterus. Opponents say the replication of cells, regardless of implantation in the uterus, amounts to cloning.“We think it’s a false distinction to say that a clone exists only based on geography,” said Pam Fichter, the president of Missouri Right to Life. “Look, we support ethical stem cell research, and we think cloning was misrepresented to voters. We know that a majority of Missourians oppose cloning.”Donn Rubin, chairman of the Missouri Coalition for Lifesaving Cures, which led efforts to pass the amendment, said that reproductive cloning was what the public worried about.“What we protect is a very promising form of medical research that involves cells in a lab dish, not something that involves pregnancy,” Mr. Rubin said.Some scientists and academics said they had hoped that the amendment might make Missouri a new center of embryonic stem cell research, giving the state an economic boost. Instead, it may be sending forth precisely the opposite message: that the state, despite its pioneering ballot measure, has yet to figure out where it stands on stem cell research.Mr. Lembke’s measure failed to reach the floor of the State House this spring, but the intended outcome of the research amendment has been delayed by actions like the blocking of the research building at the University of Missouri.“Any time you have these kinds of debates, it has a statewide impact,” said Dr. Gordon H. Lamb, the university’s interim president. “It also has an impact on people who look at the state as a whole from the outside.”Jaci Winship, the executive director of Missourians Against Human Cloning, said her group was weighing the possibility of a new initiative, perhaps as soon as next year. Members of Missouri Right to Life have been gathering names and contributions for such an effort.Mr. Rubin’s group, meanwhile, has continued raising money, bracing, he said, for another fight.'"
"'07-08-10,'0','The agency came under criticism in recent months for failing for more than a year to alert the public to studies that suggested that Avandia, a medicine prescribed for Type 2 diabetes, may increase the risks of heart attacks and angina.Agency officials initially dismissed concerns about Avandia’s safety, but a panel of experts voted overwhelmingly on July 30 that the risks were real.“It’s hard to know if this will play out similarly until we have completed our analyses” of Prilosec and Nexium, said Dr. Paul Seligman, the agency’s associate center director for safety policy and communication.Concerns about Prilosec and Nexium began on May 29 when AstraZeneca sent the F.D.A. the results of a 14-year study of the treatment of reflux disease that compared patients taking Prilosec with those who underwent surgery.Within a year of the study’s inception, patients taking Prilosec were more likely to have heart attacks, heart failure and heart-related sudden death than were those who underwent surgery. The effect continued throughout the study, the drug agency said.A second, continuing study of Nexium found similar risks early in the trial, but this effect seemed to go away as the trial continued, the agency said.The Prilosec study suffered from several weaknesses that could have led to a false suggestion of a risk, the agency said. Patients who underwent surgery tended to be younger and healthier than those who took Prilosec. And 14 other Prilosec studies found no heart risks, it said.“Based on everything we know now, F.D.A.’s preliminary conclusion is that the observed difference in risk of heart attacks and other heart-related problems seen in early analyses of the two small long-term studies is not a true effect,” the agency said in a written statement.The parallels with the Avandia situation are striking, demonstrating the difficulty of trying to assess drug safety issues.In the case of Avandia, a combined analysis of more than three dozen short-term studies revealed a heart risk, but the drug agency largely dismissed this result when a continuing long-term trial did not find such a risk. With Prilosec, a long-term trial suggested a heart risk, but the agency dismissed the finding because 14 briefer studies were more reassuring.Prilosec and Nexium, which are nearly identical, are part of a class of medicines known as proton pump inhibitors that resolve heartburn by reducing the stomach’s production of acid. Among the other drugs in this class are Prevacid, Protonix and Aciphex.The F.D.A. has asked for safety data from the makers of all proton pump inhibitors. Dr. Seligman said.The agency’s announcement about Prilosec and Nexium was the earliest public warning that it had ever made during a safety review, Dr. Seligman said.“We were cognizant from the earliest submission about whether and how we should say something,” Dr. Seligman said.'"

Michael Onuscheck, who oversees the pain management implants, will become head of the neuromodulation operations.“We look forward to building on our proud record of achievement in hearing health and to further developing the implantable drug pump technology,” Mr. Greiner said in the statement released by Boston Scientific.The new arrangements will save Boston Scientific $500 million in payments that would have been due in 2008 and 2009 and a potential $2.1 billion that might have come due in future years, according to Paul Donovan, a spokesman for Boston Scientific.Mr. Donovan said the pain management business was on track to bring in $200 million in revenue this year and to generate profits. He said the company thought that sales would climb to $250 million in 2008 with increasing profits.“We also think there is synergy between the microelectronics in this business and our C.R.M. business,” said Mr. Donovan, referring to implantable cardiac rhythm management devices like defibrillators and pacemakers.The new deal addresses pressing needs for Boston Scientific, which faces heavy debts from its $27 billion acquisition of Guidant last year and unexpectedly weak sales in defibrillators and coronary stents, its two largest businesses. It reduces a potential drain on cash at a time when investors have become increasingly worried about how the company will pay off the Guidant debt.Those concerns were spotlighted last week when Boston Scientific decided not to pursue a public offering of a minority stake in its endosurgery operations, which develop devices to treat digestive, urological and gynecological disorders. That deal might have brought in up to $1 billion to reduce the debt. The company’s stock fell to five-year lows, and credit agencies cut their ratings on its bonds.Boston Scientific’s shares rose 56 cents to close at $13.76 yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange in trading that ended before the announcement. But they fell as low as $13.20 in after-hours trading before rebounding.“At the margin, it’s a net positive for Boston Scientific,” said Lawrence Keusch, who follows the industry for Goldman Sachs. “They keep the best components, and they are getting rid of long-term overhangs.”Investors’ initial negative reaction may have reflected in part Boston Scientific’s forecast that the deal would require an after-tax charge against earnings of $360 million.'"
"'07-08-10,'0','So they are using their bottles, cans, boxes and plastic packs to improve sales by attracting the eyes of consumers, who often make most of their shopping decisions at the last minute while standing in front of store shelves.“The media is fragmented, and we can’t find people — we can’t get them to sit down and listen to our argument on a television spot,” said Jerry Kathman, chief executive of LPK, a brand agency based in Cincinnati. “The package can convey that argument.”As recently as the 1990s, most package designs were retained for seven or more years. Now marketing executives say they are constantly planning package overhauls. The average life of a package before its next makeover is down to two years, they add.Shoppers have also grown accustomed to looking for a little visual pop on aisle shelves as design has become a mainstream marketing tool — Target stores in particular use that visual pop as a key advertising theme, for example. Sameness carries a risk that a product will fade into the background.“Consumers are looking for what’s new,” said Kimberly Drosos, director for package development at Unilever North America, which recently changed the shape of its Suave shampoo bottles for the first time in 25 years, and sells Axe shower gel bottles shaped like video-game joysticks.Ms. Drosos added: “They say, ‘What else do you have for me? That was nice last year, but I want the packaging to be refreshing.’ ”There are many other reasons behind the shift. Some packaging changes are occurring because companies are trying to shrink container sizes and reduce their environmental impact, or because of new approaches for old products (Orbit now sells gum in a bottle made to fit in a car’s cup holder). Some brands are bragging that their bottles of cleansers and other household products are attractive enough to be left out in plain view, rather than hidden in a closet or drawer.“It’s an inexpensive way to really deliver that newness to people’s homes,” said Becky Walter, director for innovation design and testing at Kimberly-Clark, the maker of Kleenex, Huggies and other brands. “It’s not like they have to go out and purchase new furniture.”Evian is among the marketers using packaging to add a sense of luxury to ordinary products — its new “palace bottle” water, for example, is being sold in restaurants and hotels. The bottle has an elegant swanlike neck and sits on a small silver tray. Technology is also driving the changes — like the thermochromatic ink in the Coors label that changes the color of the label’s mountains with the temperature of the beer bottle.And in the next few years, Pepsi drinkers may smell a sweet aroma that is sprayed out when they pop open Pepsi cans — such as a wild cherry scent misting from a Wild Cherry Pepsi can. Executives at the company have also considered cans that can spray a light water mist when they are opened, but they are unlikely to add that feature soon because of the cost, they say.Laurent Nielly, who heads packaging innovation for Pepsi in North America, said young people — Pepsi’s central audience — have shorter attention spans than previous generations, so bottles and other containers have to change more often. Pepsi is experimenting with the designs on its Mountain Dew bottles, selling aluminum bottles covered in graffiti-like designs that will be changed 12 times from May to October. The bottles are sold only in eastern Virginia now, but the soda maker may expand the approach if sales of the bottles go well.If products aren’t spraying consumers, they may someday be talking to them.Some companies are studying technology to put a computer chip and tiny speaker inside a package. This idea might be particularly useful for big companies like Unilever that want to cross-promote their various brands. So a package of cheese could say “I go well with Triscuit crackers” when a shopper takes it off the shelf. As the costs of the chips come down, marketing executives said this and other technologies would appear more on shelves.All these packaging makeovers may make trips to the grocery stores more entertaining. Or the result could be confusion, if not downright annoyance.“If you’re walking down a row in a supermarket and every package is screaming at you, it sounds like a terrifying, disgusting experience,” said Tracy Lovatt, director for behavioral planning at BBDO North America, an advertising agency in the Omnicom Group. “But if brands use this wisely, new packaging can be quite powerful. It’s the thing that will interrupt you at the store, and get you to spend time with that brand, and then, hopefully, buy in.”'"

Applied Digital set up the VeriChip Corporation, also in Delray Beach, to commercialize the tags, and sold a minority stake to the public in February. Applied Digital has relied on another publicly traded subsidiary, Digital Angel, to make VeriChip’s tags.Digital Angel, based in South St. Paul, Minn., gets most of its revenue from radio tags implanted in pets, livestock or wild animals being tracked by researchers, and from emergency beacons made by a subsidiary in Britain.Yesterday, Applied Digital said it wanted to acquire the 45 percent of Digital Angel it did not own in a stock swap currently valued at $35 million. The companies also said that Kevin McGrath had been replaced as Digital Angel’s chief executive by Barry M. Edelstein, a board member, while Digital Angel searches for a new permanent chief executive, and that Scott R.

"'07-08-10,'0','Ms. Hamann is an appointee of Mr. Spitzer’s. Republicans have criticized her for not scrutinizing the administration’s actions more closely. (Mr. Sheingold served under Mr. Spitzer when the governor was attorney general.)“Why didn’t they refer that on a timely basis?” Senator George H. Winner Jr., the Republican who is chairman of the committee, said after the meeting. He added, “That was not done, that could have been done, and that would have cleared up a lot of the matters that we had here.”The issue of subpoena power was significant; Mr. Cuomo’s investigators, because they lacked that authority, were not able to interview Mr. Baum or another Spitzer aide, Darren Dopp, the communications director, during the investigation. The governor suspended Mr. Dopp when the attorney general’s report was publicly released on July 23.The report concluded that Mr. Dopp and another aide had acted improperly but not illegally. Ms. Hamann endorsed its findings.“Certainly, having subpoena power would have been useful,” said Mr. Cohen, during his remarks before the committee. “In fact, I can’t imagine there being an investigation where the prosecutor or investigator wouldn’t benefit from the use of the subpoena.”Mr. Sheingold refused to pinpoint exactly when it became apparent to the inspector general’s office that Mr. Baum could have been involved in the effort to use the state police to tarnish Senator Bruno, saying only that it occurred toward the “very end” of the inquiry.By then, said Mr. Sheingold, Mr. Cuomo’s investigators had drafted their final report on the matter and provided it to the inspector general’s office.“We read the report, we concluded and, as I said, we concurred with the report, and then we had to make a very realistic, practical determination whether proceeding by my office would simply produce any public good or just to add to the debate,” said Mr. Sheingold. “And we determined we should get out.”Mr. Cohen said the inspector general’s office never informed the attorney general of the conflict of interest. Mr. Cuomo’s aides learned of it only after they issued their report, he said.Senate Republicans are pushing for further examination of Mr. Spitzer’s aides’ conduct. While they have praised Mr. Cuomo’s investigation, they insist that Mr. Baum’s role deserves further scrutiny, given his closeness to Mr. Spitzer and to Mr. Dopp.The attorney general’s report found that Mr. Baum had received e-mail messages concerning the effort from other aides but did not find him guilty of improper conduct.In an interview after the meeting, Stephen DelGiacco, a spokesman for Ms. Hamann, said that under her office’s interpretation of the law, no referral to Mr. Cuomo could have taken place without a finding or evidence of criminal activity. Mr. DelGiacco said that no other official had asked Ms. Hamann to decline a referral.“We never knew in the course of our investigation that the attorney general needed our subpoena power,” he added.The meeting on Thursday suggested difficulty ahead for Mr. Spitzer as he tries to move past the scandal and focus on governing. Republican and Democratic senators clashed repeatedly, interrupting and talking over one another. The Democrats said that they had not been consulted about the ground rules for the meeting and suggested that the committee could not investigate the matter in good faith because most of its members had been appointed by Mr. Bruno.Still, none of the Democrats defended Mr. Spitzer, despite his recent efforts to repair his relations with others in his party.Mr. Winner and the ranking Democrat, Senator Thomas K. Duane of Manhattan, began the meeting by bickering over its format: Mr. Winner said he would give a five-minute opening statement, which Mr. Duane said he had not agreed to.The bickering gave way to an extended soliloquy by Mr. Winner. Then came a quiet, stubborn voice, that of Mr. Duane: “Was that your five-minute opening?”“No, that was not my opening,” Mr. Winner replied, rolling his eyes.The committee plans additional meetings on the matter.'"
"'07-08-10,'0','The sluggish sales that have dogged the nation’s retailers this year are a result of two quite different sets of problems. Consumers are cautious: they are paying more for gasoline and watching their home values fall. And the stores just do not seem to have the merchandise that people want to buy.As retailers reported generally disappointing July sales results yesterday, it was clear that the weakening housing market and more expensive gas had shoppers limiting their trips to the mall. When they did go, they bought tentatively, following a pattern that began in February.But analysts say stores cannot blame economic conditions for all their problems. Even retailers catering to teenagers, like Pacific Sunwear of California and Wet Seal, which tend to be least vulnerable to the whims of the economy, had a bad month. That suggests to analysts that stores are not serving up the most exciting products.“There is a big middle that is treading water, trying to figure out what their consumers are looking for,” said Trish Walker, partner in the retail practice at the consulting firm Accenture.John D. Morris, managing director of Wachovia Securities, agreed, noting “a lot of fall trends are extensions of what worked in the spring and summer.”'"

Five arrests, documented by police records, since he was drafted in 2005 were factors in the suspension. Jones’s sixth arrest came in June in Las Vegas, where he was under indictment on two felony counts of coercion.Jones confirmed that he planned to wrestle during his suspension and defended his decision.“I don’t know what you all want me to do,” he said. “Just sit in the house and be miserable all day?”He is scheduled to make his debut with Total Nonstop Action Wrestling on Sunday night in a pay-per-view event titled “Hard Justice.”'"

Lawmakers and members of the All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen party, outraged by her criticisms of Islam and religion in general for oppression of women, threatened Ms. Nasreen with a chair and hurled a leather case, bunches of flowers and other objects at her while some shouted for her death. With her forehead bruised, she described the attack as barbaric before the police moved her to safety. In 1994 thousands of radical Muslims demanded Ms. Nasreen’s death for blasphemy, and she fled into exile after a court declared that she had “deliberately and maliciously” injured the religious feelings of Muslims with her Bengali-language novel “Lajja,” or “Shame,” about riots between Muslims and Hindus.

"'07-08-10,'0','ADAMS “The Death of Klinghoffer.” Vocalists; Orchestra of the Opéra de Lyon, conducted by Kent Nagano (Nonesuch 79281; two CDs).RUDERS Violin Concerto No. 1; other works. Rolf Schulte, violinist; Riverside Symphony, conducted by George Rothman (Bridge BCD 9057; CD).Well before the spring of 1989, when I first heard the Kronos Quartet perform Steve Reich’s “Different Trains,” Mr. Reich’s music had grown far beyond the confines of the stylistic label Minimalism.The concept for this ingeniously complex 1988 work came from Mr. Reich’s memories of childhood travels on transcontinental trains in the late 1930s and early ’40s to visit his divorced parents: his mother in Los Angeles, his father in New York. The constant clacking of the train on the tracks imprinted itself on his musical imagination. While contemplating this piece, Mr. Reich realized that, as a Jew, had he been in Europe during his youth he would probably have been traveling on quite different trains.The piece’s repetitive rhythms, cyclic riffs and persistent whistles convey the nervous, hypnotic sounds and feelings of train travel. Weaved into the textures are the recorded voices of the governess who accompanied Mr. Reich on his journeys and an old Pullman car worker, as well three Jewish refugees. The speeches, as transcribed with uncanny accuracy into pitches and rhythms, become another element in the music. The work is at once exhilarating, haunting and ominous, qualities arrestingly conveyed in the Kronos Quartet’s recording.John Adams was initially associated with Minimalism. A beguiling recent recording of his complete piano music, performed by Ralph van Raat, includes scintillating performances of “Phrygian Gates” and “China Gates,” early scores that show the composer at his most openly and sonorously Minimalistic.But Mr. Adams had bigger musical things in mind, like his landmark opera “Nixon in China.” Though I greatly admire this work, I am especially affected by “The Death of Klinghoffer” (1991), written with the same librettist, Alice Goodman, and director, Peter Sellars. The opera has been attacked for what is perceived as its sympathetic depiction of the Palestinian terrorists who murdered Leon Klinghoffer aboard an Italian cruise ship in 1985. But the creators think of the opera as a reflective work in the spirit of the Bach Passions, which mix storytelling and commentary. The score flows in undulant waves of luminous yet piercing harmonies, with elegiac, melodic writing and violent, searing outbursts.The Danish composer Poul Ruders acknowledges that he has been influenced by Minimalism. The repetitive figurations, jittery thematic lines and obsessive rhythms that abound in his invigorating Violin Concerto No. 1 (1981) would seem to prove the point, though I’d be careful about labeling it a work of Minimalism, at least in the presence of its formidable composer.ADAMS “Nixon in China.” Vocalists; Orchestra of St. Luke’s, conducted by Edo de Waart (Nonesuch 79177; three CDs).CAGE “Two2”; works for two pianos. Double Edge (Edmund Niemann and Nurit Tilles; CRI 732; CD).Minimalism is a musical art that says very few things over long periods of time. This is in opposition to music that takes a long time to say many things (Mahler), music that says very little in normal amounts of time (Saint-Saëns) or music that says a great deal in practically no time at all (Webern).Minimalism can be employed by several percussionists (“Drumming” by Steve Reich with So Percussion) or an entire opera company (John Adams’s “Nixon in China”). It is also comfortable on two pianos (“Two2” by John Cage, played by Edmund Niemann and Nurit Tilles). Minimalism, in other words, is user-friendly.“Drumming” is in four parts and goes on for quite a while (73 minutes 8 seconds, to be exact). It starts unpromisingly, but once the mind attaches itself, the music gathers an adhesive strength. As color and complexity of movement gradually evolve, the paradox of Minimalism sets in: Listeners enter a trancelike involvement but can answer the phone or go to the refrigerator and not miss much at all.“Nixon in China” translates repetition into a kind of theatrical energy. Diplomatic ritual is made to dance; political and personal anxieties take on a machinelike tic. Minimalism becomes a dramatic tool, proving its further usefulness.I like the Cage piece precisely because so little happens. It is a slow, calm appropriation of musical space. “Two2” is from 1989 and at quite a distance from the two other Cage pieces from the mid-1940s on this recording, “Experiences” and “Three Dances.” Both are quite busy.It is hard to leave the subject of Minimalism without mention of Count Basie, master of the art of leaving out. Basie’s piano solos framed unspoken musical phrases with dabs of music: chords doing the work of a jazz-music continuo and fragments of melody that point at things present but unsaid. The richness of the silences — the tantalizing promises therein — were at odds with the art of Basie’s colleague Art Tatum, who seemed determined to fill musical space with as many notes as possible. Minimalism, here as elsewhere, fills time with a minimum of means.ADAMS “Shaker Loops,” “Light Over Water.” The Ridge Quartet; other performers (New Albion NA014; CD).GLASS “Satyagraha.” Vocalists; New York City Opera Orchestra and Chorus, conducted by Christopher Keene (Sony-BMG Masterworks M3K 39672; three CDs).It sounds oddly conservative and spare now, but “Shaker Loops” (1978) was a bombshell in its time, and it introduced John Adams as an important voice in the still fresh Minimalist rebellion against modernist complexity. Mr. Adams offered all the repetitive energy that propelled Philip Glass’s and Steve Reich’s most popular scores, but his quicker harmonic development, sudden dynamic changes and other startling touches pointed toward the next step — emotional and dramatic — that this style needed to take.Mr. Adams’s later orchestration gave the work a graceful sheen, but the original chamber recording has an endearingly homespun quality. The companion piece, “Light Over Water” (1983), is a pleasantly spacey oddity for brass and synthesizers.“Satyagraha” (1980) was Mr. Glass’s move toward Romanticism, a leap from his wheezy, rhythmically intricate writing for amplified chamber band to full-fledged scoring for orchestra, chorus and operatic voices. Its stage action shows the development of Gandhi’s nonviolent resistance techniques to combat racism during his early years in South Africa. But with the text drawn directly from the Bhagavad-Gita, the story of an epic clan battle, and sung in Sanskrit, the work is also a magnificent oratorio version of this classic Hindu text. Nearly three decades on, it remains Mr. Glass’s most wrenching opera. Though a new recording is long overdue, this 1985 performance captures much of the work’s spirit.“Koyaanisqatsi” (1983) extended the neo-Romanticism of “Satyagraha” with picturesque scoring and a refreshed harmonic vocabulary. It also works brilliantly as the soundtrack of the first and best installment of Godfrey Reggio’s film trilogy about humanity’s mostly malignant influence on the earth, its alternately lyrical and vigorous movements accompanying visions of everything from the grandeur of Southwestern deserts and cloud formations to urban crowds in slow motion and sped-up film of highway traffic. The 1998 remake on Nonesuch is superb, but the way to experience this work is on the DVD.Except for a few early works in which recorded speech was mined for its rhythmic qualities, Steve Reich devoted himself to instrumental works until 1981, largely because he didn’t want his musical line dictated by the text. Biblical Psalms and a William Carlos Williams poem about the nuclear age helped him solve that problem. In “Tehillim” (1981) the Hebrew texts lend themselves to Mr. Reich’s sharp-edged rhythmic style, which in turn yields a timeless, almost ritualistic quality. And in “The Desert Music” (1984; heard here in a texturally transparent 2001 chamber version), the haunting setting of the Williams text is magnified by percussion that evokes a ticking clock, and an eerie instrumental shimmer that suggests the desert after a nuclear test.GLASS “Einstein on the Beach.” Vocalists; Philip Glass Ensemble, conducted by Michael Riesman (Nonesuch 79323; three CDs).ADAMS “Harmonium”; “The Death of Klinghoffer” Choruses. San Francisco Symphony Orchestra and Chorus, conducted by John Adams; Orchestra of the Opéra de Lyon, London Opera Chorus, conducted by Kent Nagano (Nonesuch 79549; CD).Anton Bruckner was a proto-Minimalist, the composer Ingram Marshall suggests: “He writes music like he’s writing great paragraphs.”That comment helps define a musical term that has been overused, misunderstood and often rejected by the very composers to whom it is usually applied. Minimalism can be understood as a form of musical dramaturgy in which the music grows not out of the contrast between linear phrases but from the juxtaposition of building blocks of sound.But the term Minimalism fails to connote the aural richness that can arise even in the early, most repetitive pieces, a richness that is being increasingly mined by the current generation of performers. Minimalism, in its fifth decade, is encountering the same issues of original versus modern instruments that arise with any bygone music.The early recordings have a scrappiness, a defiance and, in some cases (like the original 1979 recording of “Einstein on the Beach”), the limitations of old synthesizers. But today the music is in musicians’ fingers and ears. Just as it took a generation for pianists to conquer Beethoven’s “Hammerklavier” Sonata, the most intricate patterns of a Steve Reich are no longer in themselves a challenge.I like the toughness and aura of what you might call the period instruments of the 1970s, but when it comes to choosing recordings I seem to come down on the side of opulence. Terry Riley’s 1964 “In C,” the defining work of Minimalism, belongs in every music library, and Bang on a Can’s performance has a fluidity that brings out the depth of the repeated, interlocking patterns and the pleasure of listening to them.“Einstein on the Beach” is another — if not the other — seminal Minimalist work. The Nonesuch recording, made 17 years after this opera’s 1976 premiere, approaches it with the reverence due a masterpiece, smoothing down the rough edges and stressing the seriousness. It also restores 30 minutes of music that was cut from the original cast recording. On grounds of completeness alone, not to mention aural beauty, this 1993 recording is the one to get; here, the subtly changing kaleidoscope patterns of sound that grow out of the repeated syllables and notes only gain in color and depth.Steve Reich himself waxes eloquent about Amadinda, a Hungarian percussion ensemble, and its performance of his seminal Music for 18 Musicians, which becomes a feast for the ears in this reading. Having expressed my enthusiasm for Mr. Reich’s music sufficiently elsewhere, I have refrained from filling this list with his works alone.“Harmonium,” the first John Adams piece I heard, remains a personal favorite. Mr. Adams, unlike Mr. Glass, shows a specific awareness of vocal timbre; these settings of three Emily Dickinson poems play deliberately with the qualities of vocal sound. There is also a sense of the Americanness of this music: at once straightforward and with a kind of baroque fullness. This quality is increasingly evident in the later work of Mr. Glass and Mr. Reich as well as the work of Mr. Adams, for whom the term Minimalism is today decidedly a misnomer.GLASS Music in 12 Parts. Philip Glass Ensemble, conducted by Michael Riesman (Nonesuch 79324; three CDs).GLASS “Akhnaten.” Vocalists; Stuttgart State Opera Orchestra and Chorus, conducted by Dennis Russell Davies (Sony Classical Germany 91141; two CDs).Among admirers of Philip Glass’s work, Music in 12 Parts has long been considered his rough equivalent of Bach’s “Art of Fugue.” Written from 1971 to 1974, the extensive cycle is a four-hour compendium of Mr. Glass’s early compositional concerns. Fragmentary melodies and pulsating rhythms repeated at length evoke something of a trance state, so that tiny shifts in pitch or meter feel like major events. Yet the work also pointed toward future possibilities; the vocal writing in particular seems to predict “Einstein on the Beach.”In 1981 Mr. Glass was signed to an exclusive recording contract with CBS Masterworks, the first composer afforded such a berth since Aaron Copland. “Glassworks,” Mr. Glass’s first CBS release (now available on its successor label, Sony), acknowledged and even partly enabled his potential for crossover success. Whereas earlier recordings had documented music from his ensemble’s active repertory, the six pieces on “Glassworks” were specifically conceived as an album accessible to new listeners. Concise, evocative works like “Floe” and “Rubric” anticipated Mr. Glass’s lucrative sideline as a film composer; the melancholy “Facades” remains a staple of his concerts.The music on “The Chairman Dances,” a 1987 CD of works by John Adams, might not originally have been conceived as an introduction to his work, but the disc serves that purpose nonetheless. Mr. Adams reconciled techniques pioneered by Mr. Glass and Steve Reich with the resources of the Romantic orchestra in the 1985 title work, an uninhibited explosion of succulent melody and swooping French horns inspired by the scenario of Mr. Adams’s first opera, “Nixon in China.” Casting his net wider still, he evoked traditional hymnody in “Christian Zeal and Activity” and summoned the spirit of Charles Ives with the lonely trumpet lines of “Tromba Lontana.”Also in 1987 CBS issued a recording of Mr. Glass’s third opera, “Akhnaten,” a portrait of the iconoclastic pharaoh who briefly imposed a monotheistic religion in Egypt. Compared with “Einstein” and its successor, “Satyagraha,” the opera seems almost conventional in its procession of narrative tableaus. But Mr. Glass’s lean, percussive score includes some of his most viscerally exciting music, and assigning the lead role to a countertenor was a bold stroke.“Hymn to the Aten,” the pharaoh’s second-act paean to his deity, is one of the composer’s most communicative and ineffably beautiful creations; Mr. Glass, who must have had a sense of his achievement, instructed that the aria always be performed in the native language of the country where it is being performed.The diverse moods of John Adams are alluringly conveyed by Marin Alsop and the Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra on a Naxos disc that opens with a sparkling performance of the wildly exuberant “Short Ride in a Fast Machine.” In “Shaking and Trembling,” the first movement of “Shaker Loops,” the Bournemouth strings play as if possessed, hurling colorful arrows of sound into the kaleidoscopic dartboard of orchestral textures. The frenzied rapture builds to a dizzying fervor before melting into the eerie glissandos of the next movement. Also included is a performance of Mr. Adams’s gloomy “Wound-Dresser,” sung by the fine baritone Nathan Gunn.Philip Glass’s Violin Concerto is his first major orchestral work. It adheres to a traditional three-movement, fast-slow-fast structure for conventionally scored orchestra, but with its insistent opening chords, chromatically undulating harmonies and the soloist’s mournful arpeggios, this theatrical work is signature Glass. On the fine Naxos disc Takuo Yuasa leads the Ulster Orchestra and the violinist Adele Anthony in a vibrant, throbbing performance. Ms. Anthony’s sweet-toned, romantic playing soars over the waves of pulsating orchestral rhythms, played here with enough tension to create a taut web of sound. The disc also includes enjoyable renditions of “Company” and excerpts from “Akhnaten.”Like all masterpieces, when played with integrity and passion Steve Reich’s Music for 18 Musicians — the seminal 1976 chamber work in which he used his broadest palette of harmonic language to date — never loses its fascination. In this 1996 recording Mr. Reich and his band of musicians build on the layers of blinding colors and hypnotic rhythms in a performance with moods veering from rhythmically energetic and vital to seductively (and deceptively) languid. This performance highlights the work’s beautiful surface veneer, underlying levels of complexity and intoxicatingly therapeutic power.Other notable works from various periods of Mr. Reich’s life receive vigorous, intelligent performances by the Ensemble Modern on an RCA recording, which includes “City Life.” This aural snapshot of New York streets transforms normally irritating sounds, like sirens and honking horns, into a compelling musical fabric. The turmoil of city life is also aptly conveyed in a taut, jaunty rendition of “New York Counterpoint,” performed by Roland Diry, a stellar clarinetist.

"'07-08-10,'0','Carried interest has come under criticism because it has allowed managers of private equity firms and hedge funds to pay very little in taxes on income they derive largely from managing their investors’ assets rather than putting their own capital at risk.The latest upheaval on Wall Street came after a sell-off in Europe, which was prompted after BNP, the largest publicly traded bank in France, became the latest European lender to announce problems linked to the worsening credit market in the United States, where several large companies have already announced losses.A German central bank meeting was under way to discuss details of a rescue package for the lender IKB, another victim of exposure to the crisis in subprime lending.Jonathan Mullen, a spokesman for BNP, said that the credit squeeze in the United States had made it impossible to calculate the value of the underlying assets of the funds and that the bank was obliged by market conditions to halt holders of the funds from cashing out or new investors from buying shares in the funds.“It’s quite exceptional to suspend funds, and it means that people can’t buy in or sell out of the funds,” Mr. Mullen said. “But we hope this is going to be temporary and that the market will come back.”Mr. Mullen said that about one-third of the funds were exposed to subprime loans but that those investments were in high quality parts of that market. “We’ve seen no degradation in the quality of these assets, none of which have been put on watch for a downgrade,” Mr. Mullen said. “This is just a technical problem about liquidity.”With banks pulling back on lending over all, the European Central Bank lent more than $130 billion overnight at a rate of 4 percent to inject cash into the financial system, and the Federal Reserve added $24 billion in temporary reserves to the United States banking system.A key question is whether some European lenders know the full extent of their exposure to the subprime lending crisis. Only last week, BNP’s chief executive, Baudouin Prot, said the bank’s exposure to subprime woes was “absolutely negligible.”BNP shares fell more than 5 percent in early trading, but Mr. Mullen reiterated that the bank itself had almost no exposure to the subprime crisis. He said the funds are held by BNP clients and represent just a fraction, or 1.6 billion euros, of the 600 billion euros the bank currently has under management.Some analysts have said it is difficult to determine the exposure of banks to the United States subprime market because they are often held through collateralized debt obligations, financial products that bundle securities and help spread risks, and banks often do not disclose their exposure.Standard & Poor’s, the debt rating agency, in July cut credit ratings on $6.39 billion of bonds backed by subprime mortgages.Fitch Ratings said it was reviewing $7.1 billion, including 19 collateralized debt obligations, for a possible downgrade.Concern among investors about possible effects of subprime investments and recent woes in the credit markets have outweighed rising earnings at European banks last month.Shares of Deutsche Bank and BNP dropped on Aug. 1 even though both reported better-than-expected profit in the first half. Investors are reducing their exposure to banks with large investment banking arms, fearing losses from leveraged loans they have underwritten but cannot sell on to investors.Analysts at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, said earlier this month that while exposures to subprime may lead to “modest losses or slightly lower revenue” among European banks — but that would be “entirely manageable.”'"
"'07-08-10,'0','It was not clear how an equitable rebate could be set up for the flooding, however, since many people with pay-per-ride MetroCards paid to enter the subway system, but left when they found that trains were not running.“They didn’t treat their customers very well” during the flooding, said Gene Russianoff, the staff lawyer for the Straphangers Campaign, a rider advocacy group.“They have amends to make. It won’t reverse what happened, but it shows that the often faceless M.T.A. officials are human beings.”Mr. Sander and other transit officials also provided some preliminary details yesterday about the authority’s response to the flooding, which occurred after a sudden early morning storm doused the city, dropping 2.5 inches of rain on Central Park and nearly 3.5 inches on Kennedy International Airport.Because the rain fell in a short period of time, it overloaded sewers and subway pump rooms and filled many sections of the underground tunnels with water.The senior vice president for subways of New York City Transit, Mike Lombardi, said at the news conference that maintenance crews used portable pumps, which the agency has in case of flooding, at only one station.Mr. Lombardi said that the pumps, which weigh as much as 500 pounds and are primarily meant to be used when flooding occurs in subway stations, rather than in tunnels, were used only at the Parsons Boulevard station on the F line in Jamaica, Queens.That station, at the foot of a steep hill, experienced some of the worst flooding on Wednesday, Mr. Lombardi said, adding that the water there rose to the platform level and that several of the pumps were used to augment the capacity of two permanent pump rooms at the station.Mr. Lombardi said that there was significant flooding at about half a dozen locations in the subway system, but he said the portable pumps were not suitable for use at the other locations.He did not identify the locations or say how many portable pumps the agency has.But he said that even if the authority had had the pumps already in place at critical locations around the subway system, that would not have prevented Wednesday’s widespread service disruptions and delays, because so much water poured into the subway so rapidly.At best, he said, if the pumps had been at Parsons Boulevard before the storm, service could have been restored only about an hour earlier than it was. “The water was just too much to handle,” he said.'"
"'07-08-10,'0','Already the turmoil in the mortgage market has led Germany’s government-owned KfW development bank to bail out a bank, IKB Deutsche Industriebank, that held subprime investments. Several hedge funds in the United States, four in Australia and at least four additional funds in Europe have either closed or halted investor withdrawals as they sort out the value of their subprime and other mortgage-related investments.In reaction to the growing losses on subprime mortgages and related securities, the European Central Bank stepped in yesterday morning and provided $130.2 billion in emergency loans to European banks while the Federal Reserve injected $24 billion in liquidity into the United States banking system.Capital markets have undergone periods of extreme turmoil and lack of liquidity in the past. In 1998, the credit markets virtually froze up after the hedge fund Long-Term Capital Management buckled and Russia defaulted on its debts. Many investors dumped mortgage securities into the market and prices tumbled.Yet, the nervousness seems more intense given the amount of leverage, or borrowed money, that had been made available to hedge fund investors in the subprime and mortgage arena. The use of borrowed money, along with the sheer size of the mortgage market, should only worsen investor losses.“This is a market that has grown tremendously in the last five years,” said Professor Stijn Van Nieuwerburgh of the Stern School of Business at New York University, “and whereas a lot of the mortgages were previously held by banks, now, particularly with subprime mortgages, they are held by a lot of new players who are essentially just getting used to them.”Last year, Wall Street firms issued $773 billion in mortgage-related securities, up from $217 billion in 2001, according to the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association.Yet trying to ferret out which one of these relatively new players will be the next to report big losses on subprime or mortgage-related securities, whether they be an Asian bank or American hedge fund, is difficult.Unlike investors who hold large stakes in publicly traded American stocks, and must report those holdings to the Securities and Exchange Commission, no central government agency or private organization tracks who may be holding subprime or other mortgage-related securities in any detail. (The United States Treasury does track broad foreign country holdings of American mortgage securities.)“I don’t think any of the regulators have a handle on where the net exposure of subprime is,” said Christopher Whalen, managing director of Institutional Risk Analytics, which builds risk systems for regulators and auditors.Mr. Whalen said the situation was worse in Europe, where even less public data was available.Furthermore, because of accounting rules, some holders of these mortgage-backed securities do not have to own up to or recognize any losses until they actually sell them.But these days, trying to value certain subprime securities or the more complicated collateralized debt obligations, or C.D.O.’s, which are pools of mortgage securities, is difficult as well.Unlike stocks that trade openly on exchanges and whose value can easily be determined at any point of the day, mortgage-related securities and C.D.O.’s change hands behind the scenes via individual bids and offers made on trading desks across Wall Street.And while, typically, billions of dollars of securities can move in and out of these markets with great ease, in recent weeks trading in mortgage-related has seized up because Wall Street firms are reluctant to buy or sell them, many traders and portfolio managers said.Trading in C.D.O.’s has become a “standoff” said James L. Melcher, president of Balestra Capital, a New York-based hedge fund.Jokingly, Mr. Melcher said the attitude of some investors in C.D.O.’s seems to be: “I am dancing here. Don’t bother me about this iceberg we have hit.”If there is an upside to the mortgage meltdown, some analysts said, it may be that because these securities are held by so many investors the pain will be spread among many market participants instead of taking down a large single financial institution.Indeed, two rating agencies, Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s, said this week that the large American investment banks face modest risks and manageable losses because of subprime-mortgage losses.“The good news is that the losses will be widely distributed across the different owners of these pools of securities,” said Stuart A. Gabriel, a finance professor at the Anderson School of Management at the University of California, Los Angeles.“The bad news,” he said, “is because of the difficulties in valuing these mortgage pools and the high levels of uncertainty and panic that have set into these markets, we have a situation where there is a severe lack of liquidity in the mortgage market and that has created an extremely dangerous situation for our economy and the global economy.”'"
"'07-08-10,'0','But the storm this week, highlighting yet again deficiencies in how the authority gets information out, seemed to push riders past the limits of their patience. Those flaws are one focus of a 30-day review that Gov. Eliot Spitzer has ordered into what went wrong after the intense early-morning rains of Wednesday.The authority acknowledges that communications in its vast system lag behind those in other cities, but says it is improving its Web site, getting information to station agents just minutes after disruptions begin and slowly adding digital signs on platforms.Even so, those improvements represent only a small fraction of the billions of dollars being spent to update subway signals, replace train cars and build a Second Avenue subway line. In the view of many riders, the authority is infuriatingly unprepared — after years of repeated flooding and in an age of terror threats — for telling people the best way to go.“I think the senior management of the M.T.A. and the political structure of the state and city are oriented towards megaprojects and not towards what the system means for riders,” said George Haikalis, a longtime transit researcher. “The money being spent on the Second Avenue subway could easily produce a first-class communications system. There’s common sense that’s missing.”Thursday night, after the National Weather Service issued a flash flood watch for the city, Elliot G. Sander, the authority’s chief executive, announced that officials were rechecking storm drains, placing pumps at all of the system’s “flood-prone” locations, calling in additional signal, ventilation and drain maintenance workers, readying buses to ferry stranded passengers, and delaying all but the most urgent construction.As for improving communication, managers and other employees were to be dispatched to the busiest stations. Some were given bullhorns.Of course, the scale of New York’s subways, which deliver 4.9 million rides each weekday, dwarfs any other system in the country, making it much harder — and more expensive — for the authority to maintain and improve its communications system. On Wednesday, the authority’s Web site, one of the busiest in the country, was updated frequently and received a record 44 million hits. (A hit is a request for a single file on a Web server.)However, untold numbers of people had trouble getting through to the site. The firewall software that screens users on the network could not handle the surge in traffic, so technicians tried to free up capacity by asking employees to limit their online activities and by disabling bandwidth-consuming functions, like videos of old board meetings, on its Web site.“To say the Web site was down is not correct,” said Christopher P. Boylan, a deputy executive director of the authority. “It was just at its maximum capacity.”That distinction did little to help Richard Cattafesta, 46, an advertising executive who lives in Windsor Terrace, Brooklyn, and who gave up waiting for a bus on Wednesday morning after several passed him by. He went home, thinking he could get an update online.“I got on the Web and got to the M.T.A. site, but I could not download any information,” he said. “I clicked ‘reload’ again and again. I finally got a partial download, but I got no service information whatsoever — just the banner of the site.”Once a week, the authority e-mails an advisory to about 60,000 subway riders who have signed up for the service, notifying them of scheduled service diversions, which are usually a result of weekend track work. The authority’s two commuter railroads, the Long Island Rail Road and the Metro-North Railroad, can quickly send e-mail messages to riders about disruptions and delays, but the subway system, which serves far more people, cannot do so.The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which operates the PATH system, has since January been sending e-mail alerts to nearly 9,000 riders. They are notified of any delays of more than 15 minutes, and they can customize the alerts so they receive information only about the lines they use.It will be a while before the Metropolitan Transportation Authority can do that for subway riders. “Usually when stuff happens, it happens quickly and we’d have to send out 100,000 e-mails very quickly,” said Wael Hibri, the authority’s chief information officer. “We’re still thinking it through.”Here, then, is how word of major disruptions goes out for many riders: Employees stationed near train dispatchers make a telephone recording of the disruptions. The recording goes out to station agents, who are supposed to write down the information on white dry-erase boards in each booth using ink markers.“We keep an ample supply on hand,” Termain Garden, a transit official, said of the markers.Besides the boards, there are still other time-tested methods: the phone line, which plays recorded messages, and the public-address systems. (However, 92 of the 468 stations lack such systems.)Meanwhile, other transit systems are forging ahead. In Washington, Verizon has operated a cellphone system not only in the district’s stations, but also on the trains, since 1994. In Boston, in a few months, riders will be able to use cellphones at a handful of stations downtown and in the tunnels that connect them.The authority in New York has solicited bids for a contract to install a cellphone network in the underground stations. But it is months away from choosing a contractor. Even then, such a network could take years to install.“The bottom line is this is not acceptable,” said Gene Russianoff, a lawyer at the Straphangers Campaign, a riders’ advocacy group. “It doesn’t take a rocket scientist to know that the way the M.T.A. communicates with their passengers is primitive and the subject of ‘Saturday Night Live’ skits.”'"

"'07-08-11,'0','The rain that fell steadily all day ceased shortly before the first players took the Meadowlands field for warm-ups. The soggy conditions did not slow Washington, whose most memorable run of as a rookie last year was a 64-yard catch-and-carry in a deluge on Christmas night in Miami, setting up the winning field goal in a 13-10 Jets victory.The night started inauspiciously for Washington, who lost 5 yards on his first two carries. The first time he touched the ball on special teams, while fielding a punt by Michael Koenen, Washington was hit head-on by Falcons safety Daren Stone and knocked 2 yards backward.Washington is nothing if not resilient, as he proved last year by overcoming a mistake-filled first few weeks of training camp to gain Mangini’s confidence. He showed the same bounce-back ability in the first quarter, fielding a kickoff at the Jets’ 6 in the final minute and returning it 86 yards. David Irons, a rookie from Auburn, ran down Washington at the Falcons’ 8.It was an eye-popping stop by Irons, but all it did was set the stage for Jones, who scored two plays later, four seconds into the second quarter, on a 1-yard run. Later in the quarter, Washington returned a kickoff 28 yards.Early in the third quarter, he broke a 25-yard run with the help of a mighty block by left guard Pete Kendall, who has participated in training camp under protest because he is not happy with his contract.Kendall, who has started all 45 games he has played since joining the Jets in 2004, did not appear in the first offensive series. But there he was, in the right place at the right time to spring Washington on a run that helped set up a 13-yard scoring pass from Clemens to the rookie Chansi Stuckey.“Still lucky after all these years,” Kendall said.For the first time in three years, Pennington did not have to prove that he was healthy by putting the ball in the air. In each of the past two seasons, the focus during the Jets’ preseason opener was firmly fixed on his surgically repaired throwing shoulder.On this night, the focus was on keeping Pennington intact. He was the lead blocker on a reverse to Brad Smith but sidestepped contact. “I was instructed not to do a lot of things tonight,” Pennington said with a laugh. “It was weird kind of holding back and making sure I was doing what I was told to do.”It also had to be strange for Pennington to have the spotlight trained on the quarterback on the other side of the field. Harrington was starting for the Falcons in place of Michael Vick, who has been indicted on federal charges of sponsoring a dogfighting ring and has been barred from training camp by Commissioner Roger Goodell.Harrington completed 6 of 9 passes for 88 yards in one quarter of action. He was 4 of 5 during the Falcons’ first scoring drive, which covered 82 yards and was capped by a 10-yard run by Jerious Norwood. It was no real revelation that the Falcons were able to find gaps in the Jets’ secondary, which has been thinned by injuries to safety Eric Smith and cornerback Justin Miller and hurt by the holdout of the rookie cornerback Darrelle Revis.Place-kicker Mike Nugent’s off-season work in the weight room was obvious from the start. His opening kickoff ended up in the end zone for a touchback. Nugent, who said he added 10 pounds of muscle to his 5-foot-9 frame, had only two touchbacks during the 2006 regular season.'"

"'07-08-11,'0','SAN FRANCISCO, Aug. 10 — In a decision that may finally settle one of the most bitter legal battles surrounding software widely used in corporate data centers, a federal district court judge in Utah ruled Friday afternoon that Novell, not the SCO Group, is the rightful owner of the copyrights covering the Unix operating system.In the 102-page ruling, the judge, Dale A. Kimball, also said Novell could force SCO to abandon its claims against I.B.M., which SCO had sued. Judge Kimball’s decision in favor of Novell could almost entirely undermine SCO’s 2003 lawsuit against I.B.M.The ruling could remove the cloud over open-source software like Linux, an operating system loosely modeled on the proprietary Unix. The unresolved ownership has been seen as a limiting factor in the willingness of computing managers for businesses large and small to adopt open-source software, which can be adapted freely by software developers and can be legally shared or modified by end users.“It was argued that this was supposed to suggest riskiness in open source, but it turns out that the open-source world was rock solid from the beginning,” said Eben Moglen, a professor of law at Columbia University and the founding director of the Software Freedom Law Center, which advocates open-source software.SCO’s shares declined by 1 cent, to $1.55, in after-hours trading. The company’s stock reached $19.41 after the lawsuit against I.B.M. was filed in 2003.'"
"'07-08-11,'0','“This is a national problem. We will see more and more people waking up and objecting to some huge store popping up in their neighborhood.”After more than 600 people attended a recent, and raucous, Los Angeles City Council meeting that quickly erupted in arguments over race and immigration status, the Council is considering whether to allow construction to proceed or to revoke the company’s building permits and require an environmental impact and traffic study. A vote is expected by Aug. 17.“It’s not too often that our building permits are revoked,” said a spokeswoman for Home Depot, Kathryn Gallagher. “We’ve been working with the city from the beginning.”Home Depot has spent more than $2 million over more than two years trying to open the store on the site of a 93,000-square-foot Kmart that closed a few years ago. Ms. Gallagher emphasized that Home Depot was committed to opening it even if the review process took another year or two.At a more tempered Council meeting on Tuesday, several Latinos said in Spanish or halting English that they supported Home Depot because it would bring jobs to the area.A local contractor, Jose Yglesias, told Council members to focus their attention not on Home Depot but on solving problems of crime and drug use in Sunland. Since he moved to the area 10 years ago, Mr. Yglesias said, two of his cars have been stolen and his young son brought home crystal meth.“We have a problem in our schools,” Mr. Yglesias said. “There’s a lot of drugs going on. There is a lot of car thieves around. Let’s take care of the drugs, not Home Depot.”Some local opponents countered that Home Depot has bused in Latinos to create the illusion of community support, while ignoring the sentiments of residents.“They manufacture support, and they manufactured this racism thing,” said Joe Barrett, a prop designer for feature films. “They’re trying to detract from the real story, and that is traffic and all their trucks.”Mr. Barrett was referring to trucks delivering merchandise to the store as well as those belonging to contractors and other customers. The store is close to an elementary school and a mobile home park for the elderly.Ms. Gallagher said the company did not pay supporters to attend Council meetings but did acknowledge that it took them to and from the meeting and furnished them with Home Depot T-shirts. The Los Angeles Daily News, on its Web site, posted a memorandum leaked from a public relations firm hired by Home Depot that detailed how more than $24,000 was spent recruiting, feeding, clothing and busing crowds from Sunland, Tujunga and “adjacent communities” to City Hall to express support for the planned store.At a packed meeting of the Council planning committee meeting, the councilwoman representing Sunland, Wendy Greuel, urged her colleagues to revoke Home Depot’s building permits because its construction constituted more than a remodeling of the Kmart site because a new floor, new walls and a new ceiling had been added.The committee agreed, leading to next week’s vote by the full City Council, which could require Home Depot to scale back its plans to accommodate traffic and other concerns. John Song, a Korean-American and the owner of a hardware store in Sunland, said that for him, objections to the new store had nothing to do with race.“This is going to kill my business,” Mr. Song said.'"
"'07-08-11,'0','Rudolph W. Giuliani sought yesterday to clarify comments of a day earlier in which he called himself “one of” the Sept. 11 cleanup workers and said he had been “at ground zero as often, if not more, than most of the workers.” His statement has attracted sharp criticism from first responders and a rival campaign.“This is not a mayor or a governor or a president who’s sitting in an ivory tower,” Mr. Giuliani, the former New York mayor and current candidate for the Republican presidential nomination, said Thursday at a stop in Cincinnati. “I was exposed to exactly the same things they were exposed to. So in that sense, I’m one of them.”Many of the firefighters, police officers and other responders to the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, spent 24-hour days at the World Trade Center site in the early weeks, sifting through debris that many now claim gave them serious illnesses.Mr. Giuliani’s post-Sept. 11 leadership of New York City has been the centerpiece of his presidential campaign, but he has also faced criticism over several issues, including the city’s preparedness before the attacks and whether the city did enough to ensure the safety of the workers at the site after the attacks. His comments on Thursday only intensified the ire of some first-responder groups that have opposed his presidential bid.“I found his comment to be disgracefully insulting,” said John J. McDonnell, a battalion chief and president of the Uniformed Fire Officers Association in New York. “I personally saw him on the 11th, and I can’t tell the next time I saw him” at the site after the attacks.'"
"'07-08-11,'0','WASHINGTON, Aug. 10 (Bloomberg News) — Prices of goods imported into the United States rose more than forecast in July on higher oil costs, highlighting Federal Reserve concerns that inflation may not subside.The 1.5 percent increase, the biggest since March, followed a revised 0.9 percent gain in June, the Labor Department reported Friday in Washington. Prices excluding petroleum rose 0.2 percent, the fifth consecutive increase, after climbing 0.1 percent in June.Higher raw-material costs and a weaker dollar are pushing up prices for goods from all over the world, including China and Latin America. Rising prices from abroad make it more difficult for the Fed to lower rates if the economy stumbles after the global retreat in financial markets.“There clearly are inflationary pressures in this report — we see them both in energy and outside of energy,” said Julia L. Coronado, a senior economist at Barclays Capital in New York. “It highlights the balance the Fed is trying to strike” in the middle of the market turmoil.Economists had forecast that import prices would rise 1 percent for a second month, according to the median of 51 forecasts in a Bloomberg News survey. The forecasts were for a gain of 0.2 percent to 2.3 percent.The import-price index is the first of three monthly price gauges.

"'07-08-11,'0','The Fed will be guided by its assessment of how much do banks, hedge funds, pension funds and others stand to lose and whether consumers and businesses will be able to stomach higher interest rates and stricter loan underwriting.“There are a lot of risks in front of us,” said Liz Ann Sonders, chief investment strategist at Charles Schwab. “Financial crises, in the past, when not accompanied with a recession have been good for the markets.”But, she added, “if the economic landscape deteriorates much from here, then we are going to have to suffer through a more difficult market period.”That debate, Ms. Sonders and others agree, will not be resolved anytime soon, which suggests that markets will remain choppy as information about failing hedge funds and mortgage companies dribbles out.Investor anxiety has been so heightened in recent weeks that days of stability have been shattered by the first sign of trouble tied to the debt markets.Volatility, as measured by one popular index of options trading, has surged to its highest levels in more than four years, though it remains far lower than it was early this decade and in the late 1990s.The financial sector has been among the most volatile — stocks there fell by as much as 1.7 percent during the day, only to climb as much as 1.1 percent before closing little changed.Shares of Countrywide Financial, the nation’s largest mortgage lender, and Washington Mutual, the sixth-biggest lender, opened sharply lower after both companies said they were facing a harder time selling loans and could potentially have problems raising money.While those stocks recovered much of their losses for the day, they are both down significantly for the year.A common pattern has been a surge in trading late in the afternoon, around 3 p.m., that has often sent stocks higher, as it did yesterday — though on some days, like Thursday, the move has been just as sharp on the downside.Richard X. Bove, an analyst at Punk Ziegel & Company, noted the trend in a recent note to investors and suggested that the reason was strong buying from portfolios that use computer models to buy and sell quickly, a practice known as program trading, or a foreign source like the investment arm of the Chinese government.“We are talking about such a sizable amount of buying and volume goes up and stocks react strongly one way or the other,” Mr. Bove said. “What I have trouble with is trying to figure out where it’s coming from.”But he acknowledges that the pattern will probably not last long, because as sophisticated traders figure it out they will jump in on the other side to profit from the trades.Using data from the New York Stock Exchange, Ms. Sonders of Charles Schwab estimates that program trading accounted for about 40 percent of all trades on the Big Board in recent days, up from the 30 percent range earlier this year.“That’s why we are getting these swings, this is professional- to-professional trading,” she said. “This is money that has a time horizon measured in minutes.”Indeed, there is evidence that the average individual investor has not been a big player in recent days.Flows into mutual funds that specialize in American stocks were essentially flat for the week that ended on Wednesday, according to AMG Data Services. But investors put $36.2 billion into money market accounts, the largest weekly inflow this year. Investors often put cash into money market funds, which earn more than savings accounts, that they eventually plan to invest in the market.It is not surprising that individuals are sitting on the sidelines, given the sharp moves in the market. Yesterday, for instance, all three major American indexes fell immediately after the opening bell, and at one point the Dow Jones industrial average was down 212 points. By noon, stocks were on the rebound and the indexes were briefly in positive territory, then declined. The Nasdaq finished at 2,544.89, down 11.60, or 0.4 percent.“You can’t invest into a market that does that,” Mr. Bove said. “You have a better chance at making money on the craps table than in this market.”Treasury prices were little changed yesterday. The 10-year note fell 9/32, to 99 18/32 and the yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 4.81 percent, from 4.77 percent on Thursday.Earlier, stocks in Japan, Hong Kong and Australia dropped by more than 2.5 percent. The benchmark Kospi in South Korea fell 4.3 percent, the biggest decline since June 2004. Most major European indexes plunged by 3 percent or more.In both Asia and Europe, fears about the American housing market prompted investors to sell assets and forced commercial banks to reel in credit lines.Central banks around the work stepped up efforts to slow the losses. The Bank of Japan added liquidity for the first time since the market problems began.The European Central Bank injected money into the system for a second day, adding another 61 billion euros ($84 billion), after providing 95 billion euros the day before. The Federal Reserve yesterday added money by lending $19 billion against mortgage-backed securities, then another $19 billion in reverse repurchase agreements.In Washington, Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. spent the day in what his aides said was hourly contact with the Fed, other officials in the administration, finance ministries and regulators overseas and people on Wall Street — where until last year he had worked as an executive at Goldman Sachs.“We’ve been in touch with our colleagues in other agencies and among the financial regulators and are monitoring the situation carefully,” said Michele Davis, the Treasury Department spokeswoman. “Beyond that, we are not commenting.”As investors in Asia sold off assets considered relatively risky, like Philippine stocks, they bought those considered safer, like Japanese government bonds. Asian currencies like the Thai baht also retreated against the dollar and more liquid and stable currencies like the yen.“Everyone’s been talking about a credit crunch, and not surprisingly it turned into one,” said Jan Lambregts, head of Asia research at Rabobank.While Asian banks did not seem to be directly affected, he said, “the main problem is we don’t know who is bearing the losses, and that kind of uncertainty is creating the situation that we’re in right now.”'"
"'07-08-11,'0','During her visit, Ms. Stewart, who worked as an IHOP waitress in high school and later was a president at Applebee’s, spoke of the deal and IHOP’s turnaround. Following are excerpts:Q. You surprised a lot of people with your announced plans to buy Applebee’s International for $1.9 billion — in cash — plus the assumption of debt. How did the deal come together?A. We announced in January 2006 that we would be looking at strategic alternatives, which included an acquisition.It had to be a concept that did not compete with our base business. So it couldn’t be in the family dining category, because we didn’t want to jeopardize our terrific relationship with our franchisees. It had to be something in either casual or fast food or specialty.Secondarily, it had to be something of significant size. It had to matter. And it had to be something that would really fit with our core competencies. It had to be a strategic fit.Q. This is a critical moment in your career — you are basking in the glory of 18 consecutive quarters of growth at IHOP and a strong stock price. What if you bet wrong on Applebee’s?A. I don’t see it that way. I see it as we successfully turned IHOP into this fabulous successful brand, as measured by top-line sales and franchisee health and consumers — and we are now doing the same exact thing at Applebee’s, so to me, it’s just more of the same. I don’t see it as a turning point but a repeat.Q. Your experience with Applebee’s has to help.A. For me, it’s a sense of familiarity, rekindling relationships — and just knowing a lot about the brand and having a passion for the brand, I think, makes for a great match.Q. After you complete the Applebee’s transaction, pending approval of Applebee’s shareholders and regulators in the fourth quarter, what’s next?A. I think we’re happy now. Let’s get through the transaction. I think right now our real focus is integrating the two brands. There is synergy and opportunity.Q. Your franchisees have given you a nickname — the Velvet Hammer. What’s that all about?A. What that means is — I think, because it is their nickname — that I am tough on standards and raising the bar, but I do it in a caring manner. I think I am a very people person, I’m very supportive. My style is much more collaborative, to do it in a relationship-building way.It is a different set of skills to run a franchise organization. No one reports to me. These are all very successful businessmen and women who have an entrepreneurial spirit, which I really admire and respect, but yet they want the leadership and direction from us as the franchiser. It’s a fine line you walk in providing leadership and direction and strategy and tools, but doing it in a way where it is a push-pull.Q. If you had to eat all your meals at IHOP and Applebee’s for one day, how would you do it?A. I’d start at IHOP, have a fabulous cup of our new and improved coffee and a glass of orange juice. I’d probably order a short stack of our famous buttermilk pancakes, and a side of our delicious bacon.Then I’d split my lunch visit. First I’d have lunch at Applebee’s. I’d do a pick and pair — soup and salad — with a refreshing glass of iced tea. Then I’d run over to IHOP, to have our new spinach chicken salad, probably with lemonade.Then I’d go back to Applebee’s for dinner, and have our new steak dinner with mushroom topping. I’d probably go late night back at IHOP.I might have dessert at both places. That’s a perfect day. In between I might try to jog.Q. IHOP will soon be celebrating 50 years, and you are making changes to the restaurants. What’s the new look?A. On the inside, think of it as warm colors, lighting for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Think of it as the décor package much more befitting an American icon. Think of the uniforms as much more contemporary, the same with the glassware, plateware, silverware. It’s still the heritage of IHOP but much more contemporized and much more a place you’d want to go eat breakfast, lunch and dinner. And the colors are more warm, gold tones. Much more befitting of a brand in the 21st century.The prototype is the same look inside. On the exterior we were able to add an A frame, and the entry is beautiful. It takes on the heritage. We’re known for the chalet, the blue roof. We still have that but much more contemporary. We intend to do the same thing with Applebee’s, contemporary but grounded in the bar and grill look.The menu needs to be an ongoing process, and frankly that’s the point I’m trying to make here. My commitment to the franchisees of both brands is that we’ll continue to evolve and stay contemporary, yet grounded in our heritage so we don’t fall beyond. With IHOP 50 years next year and Applebee’s almost 30 years — two American icons coming together, to form the largest sit-down restaurant chain in the world.'"

The development may move the case, which has worsened tensions between the United States and Iran, closer to resolution.Hassan Haddad, the deputy prosecutor in Tehran, told IRNA in an interview that the government had gathered the information it needed about the two academics: Haleh Esfandiari, a scholar at the Washington-based Woodrow Wilson Center, and Kian Tajbakhsh, an urban planner with ties to the Open Society Institute.“They have to do some written work and then a decision will be made about them,” Mr. Haddad said without elaborating further, the news agency reported.Ms. Esfandiari and Mr. Tajbakhsh, who have been held for three months in a notorious wing of Evin prison called Section 209, were seen on state-run television last month in a video suggesting that the two academics were involved in activities intended to overthrow the government.Another Iranian-American scholar — Ali Shakeri of the center for Citizen Peacebuilding at the University of California, Irvine — is also being held in Iran. Mr. Haddad said today that his case is not connected with that of Ms. Esfandiari and Mr. Tajbakhsh.“His case has no relations with the situation of those two,” he said. “The time has not come yet to reveal information about his case.”Mr. Haddad made no mention of Parnaz Azima, another Iranian-American with dual citizenship who has been barred from leaving Iran. Ms. Azima is a journalist employed by Radio Farda, an American-financed station based in Europe.But he did mention the case of Mansour Osanloo, a high-profile union leader who was jailed last month. Mr. Haddad said Mr. Osanloo was arrested while distributing political literature, that his arrest was not related to his union work, and that he had been sentenced to five years in jail.'"
"'07-08-12,'0','Bee Kim, 28, was a hobbyist blogger while running a vocational school in south central Los Angeles. Blogging about her personal life and issues relevant to Asian-Americans, Ms. Kim amassed a few hundred loyal readers over several years. When she became engaged and moved to New York, her blog began focusing on the details of her coming wedding. She worried that she was losing the interest of her male readers, so she moved all wedding-related posts to a new blog called Wedding Bee.As other brides-to-be started hearing about Wedding Bee, Ms. Kim began receiving requests to plan other people’s weddings. That is when she knew she was onto something. Slowly, Wedding Bee evolved.“I went from being a regular blogger that just loved to share ideas and research to more of a professional blogger, where I watched for tone, libel, and even language,” such as cursing, she said. Previously, “if I didn’t like a vendor, I’d vent away knowing they’d never read my post. Now when I review a vendor, I know the vendor is likely to stumble across my post. So I check the facts, make sure the tone is balanced, and basically pretend to be a real journalist.”By inviting other women to become contributors, Ms. Kim spawned a group of about 20 other co-bloggers from around the country. Ms. Kim, now married, still blogs under the name Mrs. Bee. Her contributors each use a blogger handle; married bloggers tend to be insects (Mrs. Caterpiller, Mrs. Firefly), while the future brides are heavy on fruits and candies (Miss Butterscotch, Miss Licorice).With each change to the business, she involved her readers. In this post, Wedding Bee Tweaks, she wrote about the decision to accept advertising, offering the proposed design up to her readers for comments.After moving to New York to be with her new husband, Ms. Kim dedicated herself fully to the blog. Now with about a million page views a month (and nearly 500,000 unique visitors), according to the tracking service Sitemeter.com, Ms. Kim says, Wedding Bee is earning enough from advertisements to cover a salaried part-time editor and cover rent and living expenses in their West Village one-bedroom apartment.Carmina Perez, 47, began her blog, Mogulettes-in-the-Making, about six months ago after a long career in finance and media. Over the years, she had taken a few stabs at starting various businesses, but she always returned to the security of a job.When her last job came to an end in May 2006, she decided to get serious about entrepreneurship. But this time it would be different. She now had a considerable financial cushion so she could support herself while building a business.In the past, Ms. Perez always started businesses on her own, and the isolation was part of the reason she never went far. Blogging seemed like the way to create an instant community of support.Mogulettes-in-the-Making, the blog, is about helping other women build their businesses, the very business Ms. Perez is in the midst of building. Typical posts document meetings where she brings in an expert to teach her “mogulettes” something, like this post about a session on computer security, a lecture she organized with a guest speaker about public relations or a field trip to the Science, Industry and Business Library in New York City, which offers reference resources and free sessions with business counselors for entrepreneurs.Though the blog has only about 300 page views a month, Ms. Perez has developed a small following among women who look to her for advice.When Ellyssa Kroski, who is in her mid-30s, completed her master’s degree in library science in 2004, she could not find a full-time job. She was working part time in the Butler Library at Columbia University and in technology consulting, the work she did before she started her master’s program. She decided that blogging about her expertise might be a way to build connections in the field that could lead to a job.Befitting a librarian, Ms. Kroski’s posts are well researched and well cited, the old-fashioned way, using properly formatted footnotes rather than hyperlinks.And the blog did lead to a job, an adjunct faculty position at Long Island University’s Palmer School of Library and Information Science. But in the meantime, her interests have changed: while the job is not full time, because of her blog Ms. Kroski’s horizons have risen even further.“As a new librarian, no one would publish me,” Ms. Kroski said. Yet, after publishing her first article, “Authority in the Age of the Amateur”, on her blog, Infotangle, and circulating it to bloggers in her field, she discovered that she was cited everywhere.“It’s been a snowball effect ever since,” she said. “I started making all kinds of connections and getting invitations to speak at national conferences. And within eight months of starting the blog, I was approached by a publisher to write a book about Web 2.0 for librarians.”A version of this article published earlier referred incorrectly to the anonymous online postings of John P. Mackey, the Whole Foods chief executive. They were on financial message boards, not in a blog.'"

"'07-08-12,'0','Venice was founded 1,600 years ago as a water-protected haven for people fleeing barbarians, and, fair or not, it has faced charges in recent decades of retreating from the modern, at least as far as its architecture is concerned. Frank Lloyd Wright and Le Corbusier wanted to build here but had no luck.But five years ago, the acclaimed Spanish architect Santiago Calatrava was able to land the contract for the city’s newest bridge, even with his reputation for modernism. In flexible designs often modeled on the human body, he has built two dozen bridges around the world and the Olympic Sports Complex in Athens. He is also commissioned to build the PATH train terminal at the World Trade Center in New York and a 2,000-foot spire in Chicago expected to become the second-tallest building in the world.In practical terms, the bridge is meant to make it easier to move — on foot, of course — between the train station and the bus terminal at Piazzale Roma, major transportation centers in the north of Venice. The bridge may be red but it is svelte and, supporters say, gracefully unobtrusive; when completed, it will extend 308 feet with no cables. To connect it to tradition, the bridge will be partly built with local Istrian marble.Despite the nod to history, the bridge has faced intermittent grumbling since the contract was awarded in 2002, splitting the city between strong supporters and detractors. Still, however deeply felt, the opposition never hit a decisive crest even as the span’s construction dragged on for years and its cost more than tripled to nearly $14 million.And just after noon on Saturday, it became officially too late.Earlier this week, the huge central span was assembled and floated into place by barge. In a bit of public engineering theater on Saturday, the span was first rotated 180 degrees, then the barge carrying it inched its way between two buttresses that extend from either shore. The span was lifted above the buttresses with enormous hydraulic jacks, painstakingly lowered into place and welded fast.After years of fuss, the end seemed slightly anticlimactic: when the span finally came to rest after 1 p.m., a few cheers went up, and the crowd went home.Salvatore Vento, Venice’s head of public works and overseer of the bridge project, said it was vital for improving the flow of millions of tourists and residents. Artistically, he said, it sent the right message about Venice’s willingness to modernize, however much it might earn its living on its long past.“In Paris, the Eiffel Tower was contested but now it is the symbol of the city,” he said. “In time I think this will become a symbol of Venice. It will enter into the history of the city.”The bridge will not open until December. At the moment, it has no name.It may be worth noting that the city’s most famous bridge, the Ponte di Rialto, finished in 1591, has not been universally loved over the years. “As a work of art, we must frankly admit, the bridge lacks distinction,” one of the city’s 20th-century historians, John Julius Norwich, wrote.Yet it has stood as an icon of Venice. “Somehow,” Mr. Norwich wrote, “it gets by.”The Rialto was, in fact, the only bridge across the Grand Canal until 1854, when Ponte dell’Accademia was erected. The third bridge, Ponte degli Scalzi, which means “bridge of the barefoot,” was finished in 1934.'"
"'07-08-12,'0','And at that price, they are not adding any stipulation requiring new owners to open their property to future reunions.“Things just sort of came together, where we felt ready,” Mr. Howard told one of the many callers. “Yes, we’ll be here. Just give a shout before you come.”The house where they live with their son, Zack Howard, 14, was once the home of Max Yasgur, a dairy farmer and a major landowner in this part of Sullivan County, about 90 miles north of New York. By a quirk of fate in the mostly regimented and low-profile life of a farmer, he earned a special footnote of affection in the American cultural history of sex, drugs and rock ’n’ roll:On short notice, in August 1969, Mr. Yasgur leased a 300-acre alfalfa field to the organizers of the Woodstock music festival. And that, in the shorthand of all the notions and emotions generated there on his trampled field, became Woodstock. The festival was named for the town 75 miles away where it was originally to be held, and from which it had to be rerouted at the last minute because of permit problems.Mr. Yasgur is a revered figure in the folklore of Woodstock for his impromptu accommodation and for his brief but heartfelt address to the half million people who lived in his field for three days. (It is captured in the 1970 movie documentary of the event: “The important thing that you’ve proven to the world is that a half million people can get together,” he says, “and have nothing but fun and music. And God bless you for it.”)Joni Mitchell put him in the first verse of her song titled “Woodstock.” When she comes upon a “child of God” walking along the road, he tells her: “I’m going on down to Yasgur’s Farm, I’m going to join in a rock ’n’ roll band. I’m going to camp out on the land, and get my soul free.”Mr. Yasgur died in 1973. Mr. Howard and Ms. Abramson, who owned a package store and beverage distributorship in the area, bought his home and about 100 acres around it in 1985.Of course, everything having to do with Woodstock and its time has drifted to a locus a few degrees of separation from its beginnings. And so it is with Yasgur’s Farm, and with the town of Bethel, and the whole gestalt of the Woodstock Nation counterculture thing.The house and barn and acreage around it, for instance, are actually more than a mile away from the place where Woodstock, the event, took place. It was all of a piece in 1969, but parts have since been sold off.And the place where the event happened, in all its unpredictable and magical permutations, was sold to a nonprofit foundation set up by a billionaire entrepreneur and former marine named Alan Gerry. Mr. Gerry built an open-air performing arts center there with seating for 5,000, lawn space for 12,000, an air-conditioned museum pavilion, a staff of guides who wear uniform lavender T-shirts, and a kiosk where the hard of hearing can rent amplification devices. Smoking is not allowed anywhere on the grounds.Bob Dylan performed at the new arts center in June; Arlo Guthrie will this month. There is lots of security. Food must be carried in one-gallon plastic bags. There is no camping.Most people in town are happy with it, and hope it will help the local economy. But among the remnants of the hippie tribe, some of whom live here year-round, there is a sense of loss in the coming of what they see as a prettified and manicured version of the Woodstock idea.“I’ve been over there to the arts center, man, and it’s very nice, but that place is just another ‘venue,’ ” said John Jules, 45, a local musician. He and some area residents were at a bar called Hector’s discussing the ramifications of the coming end of Yasgur’s Farm. “Roy wasn’t perfect, but what he tried to do was much more in the spirit of Woodstock. People got together. They really made a community together in those reunions.”Harold Russell, the supervisor of the Town of Bethel and himself a farmer who owns the dairy processing facility that used to be Yasgur’s, said he felt no sense of loss about this. His home and dairy sit next door to the property now belonging to Mr. Howard and Ms. Abramson, and he was never fond of their reunions.“If people want to come here and celebrate Woodstock, that’s fine. But in today’s society, people expect everything to be done properly. Someone gets sick at one of these unregulated events, and the town can get sued.”Mr. Howard grimaces at mention of “the millionaire’s place,” as he calls the new center. He contends (as he also did in a federal lawsuit, which he eventually lost) that the town’s crackdown on his reunions was done to benefit Mr. Gerry and his performance center. (Matthew McNeil, the center’s director of marketing, says this is false.)“But we’re finished with that,” said Mr. Howard, sitting in a reclining chair, gazing through his window at a field of grass that was once contiguous with the field of alfalfa that was for three days in 1969 the site of the second-largest city in the state of New York.“Now I’m just worrying about when we leave here, what I’m going to do with all my stuff.”They have already purchased a large and comfortable home just outside Phoenix. But there is no barn there, no hundred acres.Then the phone started ringing again. And when he answered it, his gaze moved to a place and time somewhere in the distance between here and there.'"
"'07-08-12,'0','Mr. Bey and his descendants drew their inspiration from Elijah Muhammad, the Nation of Islam leader. Several black Muslim clerics in the Bay Area recall that Mr. Muhammad excommunicated Mr. Bey in the early 1970s, but the reasons were murky.“They claimed Islam but they were absolutely not Muslims,” said Delmont Y. Waqia, the director of Islamic studies at Al Salaam mosque in Oakland and Mr. Bailey’s brother-in-law, noting that Mr. Bey did not worship at any mosque.Still, Mr. Bey copied the Nation of Islam in its ideology and appearance, the men wearing suits with bow ties and the women headscarves. The slice of the group’s creed he emphasized was that African-Americans had to make their own heaven on earth — there was no afterlife — with proof of righteousness embodied in a good business and a Cadillac, other Muslim leaders said.His message was welcomed, particularly given Oakland’s role as a font of black nationalist organizations like the Black Panthers.Community activists raised in Oakland remember Your Black Muslim Bakery as a beacon that became a string of enterprises including a community school, which is now closed, and numerous bakery outlets.“There was a time when it was full of brothers and sisters coming in and out, and it seemed like it was thriving,” said Jakada Imani, the executive director of the Ella Baker Center for Human Rights. “There was a magnetism — everything was new and shiny and clean and pretty.”But in weekly sermons broadcast on the first black-owned local cable television channel, Mr. Bey made racist attacks against whites.When Mr. Bey died in 2003, the bakery’s reputation was severely tarnished because he had been charged with raping a 13-year-old girl a decade earlier. He died before the case came to trial, but local news reports said DNA evidence linked him to the woman’s child. His death sparked a bloody fight for control of the business empire, with two men killed and the youngest, most violent members asserting control, said A Saleem Bey, who described himself as Yusuf Bey’s “spiritual son.” He said the elder Mr. Bey fathered some 45 children, but his closest followers considered themselves kin, adopting his surname.His death left a vacuum. “All they knew was that black man was God, that there was no afterlife and you can do what you want,” Mr. Waqia said. “They had no leadership, no direction and no way of evolving. Their response to any disagreement was violence.”Yusuf Bey IV, now 23, was arrested in 2005 and charged with vandalism and a hate crime after police said he smashed liquor bottles and other merchandise in Muslim-owned stores in Oakland. Islam forbids alcohol.“It was just an impulse that we are tired of these Arab folks getting rich off black people’s misery, so let’s go tear a few of their stores up,” Mr. Waqia said. “You have action after action like this — they were violent, ignorant and misled.”At their height, the various organizations employed more than 100 people, A Saleem Bey said, but that had shrunk to less than 20 this year.The charges that have accumulated against Yusuf Bey IV, a younger brother, Joshua, 21, and another man include kidnapping, carjacking and torture. In April 2006, Yusuf Bey IV was charged with assault after being accused of trying to run over several bouncers who had evicted him from a strip club in San Francisco.His lawyer, Lorna Brown, did not return phone calls seeking comment. All of the cases are pending.Still, the bakery continued to draw support from elected officials. In part Mr. Bey’s heirs were living off the bakery’s reputation, and they were as adept as the father in accusing City Hall, the police and other institutions of racism. Among the more widely publicized problems associated with the bakery was a $1.1 million loan from the city for the parent company to start a home health care business in 1996. The business never materialized and the loan was never repaid.“People didn’t know what to do, what to make of them, what to do with this underclass,” Mr. Brown said. “It is kind of go along, get along, but in my book that is not leadership.”With the killing of Mr. Bailey, whom activists describe as a member of the city’s black elite, rarely directly touched by the vaulting murder rate, that attitude changed.The Oakland police have repeatedly denied turning a blind eye to the bakery, and Mayor Ron Dellums bristled at a question about City Hall’s longstanding support for it. Mr. Dellums’s spokeswoman, Karen Stevenson, said a widespread investigation had been started since Mr. Dellums took office in January.Representative Barbara Lee, a Democrat from Oakland, issued a statement on Thursday expressing regret for endorsing the bakery’s efforts to gain more time to solve its debt problems.“Like many people,” Ms. Lee said, “I historically supported the bakery because it has been an important institution in the community. But it is clear that is no longer the case.”'"

Central banks in Europe and Japan, as well as the Federal Reserve, injected funds into the financial system.The subprime mortgage crisis was, again, the immediate cause of the volatility.

How ironic that Mayor Bloomberg has neglected to consider the very people who make New York the arts capital he’s claimed to care so much about.Take musicians, many of whom need to navigate the city with large instruments and sound equipment in order to do what we do in the clubs and concert halls that contribute so much to the city’s economy, vibrancy, reputation and very identity.If a toll of less than $10 seems negligible, the fact is that many working musicians today earn no more than musicians did 50 years ago (that is no exaggeration, and that’s actual dollars, not dollars adjusted for inflation). Musicians I know, myself among them, take public transportation when we can. But there are times it just doesn’t work.In fact, I’d like to see the mayor hop on subway during rush hour and then walk six blocks in the rain carrying an acoustic bass, an amp, a keyboard, music stands and a drum kit.In “Mandatory Fairness” (Op-Ed, July 22), Dirk Olin correctly praises the Legislature’s failure to pass an immunity for arbitrators law. In my two-lawyer firm in Brooklyn we regularly speak to average working people who are victims of a civil wrong and discover that they will have no access to the legal system because at the courthouse door they must answer the question, “How much justice can you afford?”Arbitration is a good idea and can make justice more accessible to everyday people. Putting arbitrators in a position of dependence on being chosen by the large corporate arbitration users tilts the playing field unfairly.One way to try to fix the problem would be to end the process of having the parties choose their arbitrator. If we forbid “judge shopping” in a courthouse, the same should apply in arbitrations. The arbitration system needs an arbitrary referral process, the administration of which would be subsidized by an annual fee from the volume users so that arbitrators get randomly assigned by a computer.I find it ironic that Ben Gibberd selected Joe Anastasio, Miru Kim, Steve Duncan and Moses Gates as the central figures in “Children of Darkness,” his July 29 article about urban explorers, when even Mr. Gates mentions that graffiti artists are “almost always first” on the scene.Wouldn’t it have been true to the article to profile what would most likely be young artists of color? The graffiti artists have the real story on what it means to conquer these hidden spaces.'"
"'07-08-12,'0','The Power dependability study ranks three-year-old vehicles by the number of problems reported by more than 53,000 original owners. The report offers a look at how vehicles are holding up over a longer period — problems caused by components that break as a result of use or age and have to be replaced, rather than issues that arise from faulty assembly.The study ranks 38 automakers by the number of problems for every 100 vehicles; the lower the score, the better the ranking. At the top, Buick and Lexus each tallied 145 problems per 100 vehicles. Land Rover, a perennial cellar dweller, was again at the bottom with 398 problems per 100 vehicles, although it has improved with 40 fewer problems per 100 than last year. Hummer was the most improved brand.Over all, the news is good, with two-thirds of the brands improving from last year. That shows the industry is continuing to improve in long-term durability, according to Power. The industry average this year is 216 problems per 100 cars, 11 fewer than last year.Still, the study found that about 65 percent of owners experienced one or more problems that required replacement of a component, which could be anything from a wear item like brake pads up to a transmission. This is important to automakers: owners who had to replace parts during the first three years of ownership are considerably less satisfied than those who didn’t, and less likely to be loyal to the brand.The dependability report can be helpful to consumers looking for a used vehicle because it provides the names of the top three models in 19 car and truck segments ranging from subcompact car to large pickup.Factors contributing to Buick’s showing include G.M’s efforts at continuous product improvement and the long production run of models like Regal and Century, which gave the company time to work out problems. In addition, older owners — the typical demographic of brands like Buick and Mercury — “tend to be a bit more lenient or they tend to notice fewer problems,” said Joe Ivers, executive director for automotive quality and customer satisfaction at J. D. Power.Mr. Ivers insisted that this did not diminish Buick’s achievement. “Buick now has a track record,” he said.There is also some reason to expect the new Buicks will fare well, Mr. Ivers said, because they also did well in short-term quality reports: “G.M. has some ambitions for Buick, to resurrect that brand by repositioning it to actually, of all things, compete with Lexus.“Ten years ago, everybody in the room would have been laughing,” Mr. Ivers said. “In fact, some people still would. But we could argue with our data that Buick is beginning to become more credible as a competitor.”Lexus has long had a reputation for treating its customers right, but this year Buick beat Lexus in another Power survey, which measured satisfaction with dealership service departments.“I’m not saying this is definitive proof, but I’m suggesting that now is a good time to start raising the question of whether Buick in fact is ready for prime time,” Mr. Ivers said.The dependability study also suggests that the long-term quality of cars made by the South Korean automakers Hyundai and Kia may not yet be quite as good as had been indicated by the 2004 Initial Quality Study, a measure of faults in the first 90 days of ownership.In that study, the Korean automakers cut their initial quality problems by 57 percent over the previous six years; Hyundai in particular found itself in the enviable position of being in the top 10 in initial quality.But those same 2004 models are now part of this long-term quality study, and Hyundai is not in the top 10 but in 23rd place, below the industry average. Hyundai had 228 problems per 100 vehicles, worse than the industry average of 216 problems.“Longer-term quality is the high hurdle, Mr. Ivers said. “But Hyundai is definitely in the hunt.” In addition, Hyundai is still improving at a rate that is about twice the improvement rate of the industry on average, he said.Mercedes-Benz made noteworthy gains, moving above the industry average after years of struggling. But it still came in well below its archrival, BMW, the top-rated European automaker.Still, for consumers who cannot afford a luxury vehicle, the good news is that the gap between luxury and nonluxury brands has been narrowing and will continue to diminish, Mr. Ivers said.'"
"'07-08-12,'0','When a player on the Mets hits a home run at Shea Stadium, a giant fiberglass apple, nine feet in diameter, rises from a 10-foot black top hat beyond the outfield wall. But this bit of theatrical kitsch, a fixture of Mets games since 1980, is unlikely to survive beyond the 2008 season.Dave Howard, the team’s executive vice president of business operations, said the apple will be retired when the team moves to its new stadium, Citi Field, in 2009. That is, unless a pair of fans named Lonnie Klein and Andrew Perlgut can prevail.The two men, both in their 20s, were at a home game last season when Carlos Beltran hit a low fly ball over the wall in center field, cueing the apple to begin its joyous ascent. It was at that moment that the two fans realized that their beloved tradition might be doomed. As Mr. Perlgut, a health care analyst who lives on the Upper East Side, put it, “We just sort of looked at each other and said, ‘What’s going to happen to the apple?’ ”Rather than sit back and hope for the best, they started a Web site, savetheapple.com, and gathered more than 2,000 signatures on an online petition. Their efforts have been reported on Gothamist.com and other blogs.Mr. Howard said the Mets may replace the apple with a new model and may not discard the original prop. “We are considering various possibilities to have it on display for our fans at Citi Field,” he said.But Mr. Klein and Mr. Perlgut are not interested in compromises. “We don’t need any crazy gimmicks, shiny apples, bright lights,” their petition says, “just a large red apple coming out of a top hat.”'"
"'07-08-12,'0','IT’S not the small, lavender wooden building hunkering incongruously on the edge of a vast parking lot that serves a Barnes & Noble bookstore and a Chevys restaurant that has become an issue for this town.It’s the even smaller, lavender wooden building four feet away with the crescent moon on the door.After the town’s health officer said in the spring that that small building — a newly built outhouse next to the historic Littleton Schoolhouse — would have to be hooked up to city sewer lines, groups advocating both health and historical accuracy have come up with a compromise that any concertgoer or construction worker would be familiar with.On special occasions, like the times when members of the Parsippany Historical and Preservation Society don traditional dress and re-enact classes at the school, a portable toilet will be installed in the outhouse, then cleaned and removed when the event is over, said Gabe Yaccorino, grants administrator for the town.“Then what you have is the effect that it’s the old-time bathhouse,” he said. “Then you don’t have to do maintenance on it.”The outhouse was built last fall as part of restorations to the old schoolhouse that included new lavender paint, more concrete for the basement and a ramp to make the building accessible by wheelchair.'"

"'07-08-12,'0','The problem is that dogs talk — a lot. And much more when their owners are not home. This wouldn’t be so bad if the dogs could talk about the Yankees. But my neighbors’ dogs just bark earnestly and inanely. And when one of them barks, the rest of the dogs in the neighborhood start barking too.This, of course, annoys me, especially since I often work from home. But what owners might not realize is that by leaving their animals outside they are potentially breaking a law.Barking dogs can be considered a nuisance. “There are dog barking laws across the state,” says Elinor D. Molbegott, an animal law lawyer in East Williston, N.Y., who served as general counsel for the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. “There are also noise ordinances and common law nuisance issues.”In July, New York City’s dog barking law became much more severe. The first violation carries fines of up to $175, while subsequent violations can cost an owner $525 and an automatic court appearance.In cases where the situation appears tantamount to abuse, the A.S.P.C.A. and other animal welfare groups have the power to take the dog away on the spot — in some cases, without a warrant.A dog left alone is also prone to being territorial, thus making it more likely to bite unsuspecting neighbors. More than 50 percent of dog bites occur on the dog owner’s property. According to the Insurance Information Institute, dog bites now account for 15 percent of all homeowner’s insurance liability claims, costing about $317 million.“Once your dog has bitten someone, it poses an increased risk,” says Loretta Worters, vice president of the Insurance Information Institute. That means premiums may increase or policies might not be renewed or might exclude the dog from future coverage. You can’t blame the insurance carriers for taking these kinds of actions; the cost of the average dog bite claim has risen sharply in recent years, to about $21,200 in 2005 from $16,600 in 2002.Indeed, pets are the No. 1 cause of neighbor disputes, according to the Foundation for Community Association Research. In their latest homeowner survey, of those who don’t get along with their neighbors, 28 percent said pets are the source of conflict.Clearly, leaving a dog outside when you’re out won’t win you any votes as Neighborhood Idol. But what about Fido? Are you doing him any favors?Many dog experts believe that leaving a dog alone is an unnatural situation for the species that can lead to behavior problems like excessive barking, chewing on lawn chairs, digging in the yard and getting into the garbage.According to Katherine Miller, a behavior counselor for the A.S.P.C.A., latchkey dogs misbehaving is a new phenomenon that has “arisen in the last 30 years or so with the increase in nuclear, two-income and single-parent families.”There’s also the threat of weather changes, like storms and unexpected heat or cold — something we’ve seen a lot of in New York lately. A simple unexpected change in weather can instantly morph a loving owner into a common criminal. According to state law in New York, any person who owns a dog that is left outdoors must provide shelter appropriate to its breed, its physical condition and the climate.My neighbors and I have come to what I think is a very human (or is it humane?) compromise. Certainly, it is more humane than my poisoning their dogs like Russian spies. My neighbors leave their dogs out when they’re gone, but they gave me a key to their house. When the dogs bark too much I move them inside. The five minutes this takes is worth it for good neighborly relations. Most veterinarians agree that shock collars are also a safe option, as are citronella collars, which omit a foul odor every time the dog barks.There is no universal answer for all dogs, owners and ear-plug-toting neighbors. But surely, an unattended barking dog is the best answer for no one, human or otherwise.'"
"'07-08-12,'0','Out of boredom. And greed — for the Monboddo portrait he coveted, now lying in his living room with a fist-size hole in it. Then there was Chib Calloway. Mike thought back to his school days, with their pecking order based on heft and ruthlessness rather than brains, and how he’d always wanted to be part of Chib’s ruling elite. Sitting now with his head resting against the back of the sofa, eyes closed, he gave a dry chuckle.During the trip here in the car, he explained some of it to Allan, adding his own best guesses and assumptions. Allan refused at first to believe any of it and went so far as to call it “barely credible.” But Mike reminded him that Edinburgh had nurtured Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, and that Doyle’s creation Sherlock Holmes had spoken the truth when he said that once you had eliminated everything else, whatever was left, however improbable, had to be the truth.He wasn’t sure whether Allan would go to the police. Maybe he, too, would return home, the better to wait out his fate. As for Mike . . . well, his fate was already here, announcing itself by way of the one creaky floorboard in the hallway.But it wasn’t his nemesis — it was Laura Stanton, horrified by the destruction of so many paintings, mouth wide open, eyes unblinking.“Laura. . . . ” He managed a weak smile. “‘What are you doing here?”“I’ve been trying your phone — both your phones. When you didn’t answer, I got really scared. Mike, what in God’s name has happened?” He didn’t really need to answer. She’d picked up the Monboddo portrait. “I knew it,” she said quietly. “It was you behind the heist. You switched the originals for copies.”He admitted as much with a shrug.“Nothing to do with me, I’m afraid. See, all the time I thought I was part of a team, I was actually being groomed as the patsy.” He managed a dry chuckle at his own hubris.“So Ransome was right all along? You and that man Calloway?”“Above all of us,” Mike said quietly. “Yes, Prof. Robert Gissing. . . . ”She held the portrait toward him. “And all for this?”“Why is it so important, Mike?”“She looks like you, Laura. That’s what it comes down to — the artist’s wife, painted with such love and tenderness. . . . He made her look exactly like you.”Laura made space for herself on the sofa opposite, perching on its edge. “Might have been easier just to ask me out on a date.”When he looked up, she was smiling but with tears in her eyes. “I’m shy,” he whispered. “Never had much luck in the past with women I’ve liked.”“That’s the least of my worries,” he said, scanning the wrecked room one more time.“You can say that again.” The voice came from the doorway. “I told you, didn’t I?” one of Chib Calloway’s henchmen was telling his partner. They filled the doorway, staring in at Mike’s seated figure. “Told you it was worth checking, no matter what the boss said.”“Yeah, yeah,” his colleague muttered, stepping into the room. “You going to give us any trouble?” he asked Mike.“If only I had the strength. But Laura’s not part of this. Let her go and then I’ll come with you.”“Sounds reasonable,” one of the men said. They were standing in the space between Mike and Laura. “Mr. Calloway’s got a way with interior design, hasn’t he?” The men had a little laugh. “Up you get then, Michael, and let’s take a little walk.”Mike looked toward Laura. “Off you go,” he instructed her.“You heard the man, missie,” one of Calloway’s men said. Mike was rising to his feet, hands on knees and head bowed, so that he didn’t see whatever it was that hit him. He had a moment to register that he was flying toward unconsciousness.And another moment to wonder if he’d ever see Laura again.“Nice of you to drop by,” Chib Calloway said.Opening his eyes, Mike knew where he was: the abandoned snooker hall. Chib was standing in front of him, a goon at either shoulder. Some way off, Hate was careering balls into each other, sending them whizzing across one of the tables. Five chairs had been set out in a line, and Mike was seated at the far right, hands tied behind him, feet strapped to the chair legs. He looked to his left and saw Laura in the chair next to him, similarly bound. Westie was next, eyes tearful; then Westie’s girlfriend, Alice, venom in her eyes as she glared at Chib. At the end of the short, unhappy row sat the hapless art dealer, Mr. Watts-Fulton, whose only crime had been to become a recognized expert in his field.If only he had lied and told Hate that the Utterson was indeed an original. . . .“Wake up, dummy,” one of the goons was telling Mike. “Time to get hurt — ” His voice collapsed as Chib jabbed an elbow into his side.“Outside, the pair of you!” he snapped. “Keep watch — and if any of this lot manages to make a run for it, you have my permission to slit their throat.”The winded minion gave a grunt of understanding and jerked his head toward his colleague. Once the door was closed, Hate walked toward the line of chairs. He was tossing a red ball into the air, catching it each time with a slap of his open palm.“Lot of bodies to get rid of,” he speculated.“No shortage of resting places,” Chib assured him. “We’ve got the North Sea, the Pentland Hills, not to mention all those building sites in Granton. . . . ” Then, to Mike: “I’ve already had a fulsome apology from Westie here.” He patted the young student’s cheek, causing Westie to screw shut his eyes in expectation of something harder. But Chib just gave a chuckle instead and turned again to Mike. “But not much by way of explanation.”“And you’re looking for me to fill you in?” Mike guessed.“Do the bad puns come at no extra charge?” Mike asked. Hate made to lunge forward, the snooker ball bunched in his fist, but Chib stopped him.“I told you, Hate — he’s mine!” Hate gave a snarl but backed off a little, and Chib leaned down so he was level with Mike’s face.“How smart was it to go back to the apartment?” he asked.“About as smart as kicking your way through half a million in art instead of taking it with you.”“I was seeing red,” Chib explained. “And when that mist descends . . . well, I’m not exactly answerable.” He glanced toward the art student. “Westie here tells me it was Gissing’s idea to switch paintings on me. He doesn’t seem to think you knew anything about it.”“You’ve been to Gissing’s house?” Mike waited for the gangster to nod. “Then you’ll have seen the evidence. Gissing probably left town yesterday. That’s why I’d not been able to reach him on the phone — I thought he was lying low, but he’s already in deep cover. House must’ve been on the market for weeks, meaning he knew exactly what he was doing.”“And what was he doing, Michael?’“Why should I tell you?” Mike held Chib’s gaze as the face approached his own. They were almost nose to nose now, but Mike managed a smile. “One thing you need to know — I’m not afraid of you.” And it was true: Almost the only thing he had left to him, it seemed, was this lack of fear. The school bully was right in front of him, and Mike wasn’t flinching. He was aware of the others watching him — not just Laura, Westie and Alice, but Watts-Fulton, leaning forward for a better view, and Hate, pausing in his little game of toss-and-catch.“You should be afraid,” the gangster told him.“I know, but somehow it’s not working. Maybe it’s because of all that money you need me to get for you.”“I can get money without you!” Chib spat, but not even Hate looked convinced by this.“Let them go,” Mike said suddenly. “I can tell you the whole story once they’ve been set free.”“Not a chance,” Chib said. “What do I need the whole story for anyway? I know I’ve been cheated, and that’s all that matters.” He straightened up and turned his head toward the Scandinavian giant. “Which one do you want to kill first, Hate?”“The strongest,” came the answer. “Always leave the weakest till last.”“Wise words,” Chib said, turning his attention back to Mike, who suddenly realized that he had to tell the story. It was the only thing that might postpone their end.“We’ve all been cheated,” he began, “inasmuch as we’ve all been set up. Gissing planted a seed in my head — and then watered it by coming up with the notion of switching paintings in the warehouse. The plan was so well conceived, he must have been thinking about it for a while. But suddenly he had a need for it to happen, and that meant finding allies — as well as fall guys.”“You and Allan?” Chib guessed. Mike nodded, then wished he hadn’t. It was as if someone were inside his brain-pan, banging a mallet against it in an effort to escape. Whichever goon had thumped him had done a sterling job.“Me and Allan,” he was eventually able to confirm. “Gissing already had his eye on Westie for the role of forger. He was wary of you becoming involved, though — I suppose it raised the stakes. But he soon changed his mind — probably saw you as the perfect fall guy, someone the cops would love to nail. But when you asked for a painting . . . well, as far as he was concerned you were a philistine — he couldn’t let you have an original and doubted you’d ever spot a fake. So he had Westie here prepare an extra copy.”Westie nodded. “Gissing came to see me again after that first visit you made to the apartment. He told me he needed an extra copy made of the Utterson, and no one was to know about it. I asked him why, and he told me I was better off staying ignorant.” He took a gulp of air. “We made the switch while you and Allan went back into the warehouse to do the final check. The professor hid the real Utterson inside the back of one of the paintings he’d chosen — it was a nice, snug fit.” And then, for Chib’s benefit: “If I’d known it was meant for you, I’d never have agreed.”Mike watched the gangster pat Westie’s cheek again. He was thinking of the other clues: the plans Gissing had drawn up, with so much thought having gone into them; and the professor’s own comment when Mike said that the plan seemed perfect — most plans do, when you first think of them. Yes, Gissing had the heist in mind for some time, but not just to steal paintings. He’d been doing that for years, most probably, sneaking the occasional masterpiece out when he visited the warehouse on one of his many “research” trips. But then he learned of the coming inventory — a full and thorough inventory, the first one in years — and knew that the dozen missing paintings would be noticed. So he brought forward his retirement plans, placed his house on the market and went fishing for potential plotters. When the shortfall was discovered during the inventory, the police investigation would go after these dupes, while Gissing himself stayed tucked away somewhere abroad. Mike wasn’t sure where Gissing was, but he guessed it wouldn’t be anywhere mentioned by Gissing as a retirement destination. And there’d be no extradition treaty with the U.K.“I’m getting bored,” Hate complained into the silence. “Time to do some killing.” He took a step forward, and Mike turned his head toward Laura. He was almost close enough to kiss her goodbye.“Sorry I got you into this,” he told her.“I’m beginning to agree with you,” she said, plenty of iron in her voice. “So the least you can do is save the day.”His eyes stayed locked on hers, and eventually he gave a slow nod. The nodding seemed confident, and the eye contact was good.The only thing Mike lacked was a plan.Next week: Mike comes to understand how all this will end.'"
"'07-08-12,'0','As a writer bounced around quite a bit — not least by the reviewer for the Book Review when my own skeptical book, “The Old Boys: The American Elite and the Origins of the CIA,” bobbed up in 1992 — I was especially fascinated by Evan Thomas’s updated summation of the Very Best Men as presented in Tim Weiner’s “Legacy of Ashes” (July 22). The agency’s operational history over the decades seems to have been dismissed as an unremitting “march of folly.”As the years passed, and my treatment of the agency began to acquire a certain respectability, I continued to follow the machinations of the C.I.A. and stayed in touch with many of my sources. It is no discredit to Weiner, a very able reporter, to suggest that along with its well-advertised kerfuffles, the C.I.A. has done a great many things brilliantly, and has in fact plainly saved the Republic on more than one occasion. From the scrupulous analysis of the Soviet weapons overlays stolen by the agent Oleg Penkovsky and corroborated by U-2 overflights, which gave John Kennedy the proof he needed to triumph during the missile crisis, to the many years of clandestine involvement with the Northern Alliance that made it possible to eject the Taliban from Afghanistan in 2001, agency officers have risked — and often enough lost — their lives. When top agency officials are brought in to ratify some policy blunder formulated in the executive branch, as in the cases of the overestimation of the Soviet economy in the 1980s or Curveball in 2003, investigation of the record soon reveals that the agency’s own experts — in these situations, Mel Goodman and Tyler Drumheller — did whatever they could to drag the politicians back to reality.Espionage and clandestine warfare are frustrating, low-percentage undertakings. The leaders of the agency have often been timid or lax or worked up for the wrong reasons. Too often they have half-consciously served corporate interests. Still, as Thomas himself concludes, they are what we’ve got, and “there isn’t much choice but to keep on trying.”In reviewing Tim Weiner’s scathing history of the C.I.A.’s bumbling, Evan Thomas elides (as does Weiner) a positive secret adventure of the C.I.A. — its creation and support of the Congress for Cultural Freedom, which sponsored some 20 journals in as many countries to counter the Soviet propaganda that enlisted so many artists and writers to its position.Thomas’s own grandfather, Norman Thomas, a six-time candidate for the presidency, was chairman of the administrative committee of the American Committee for Cultural Freedom, which successfully fought against Senator Joe McCarthy’s ignorant accusations, which only helped the Stalinist cause. Norman Thomas once called President Eisenhower from my desk to stop an Indonesian airliner from taking off with a Columbia University student who had been sentenced to death in Indonesia; now that student is the sultan of Ajeh.Important for today is the essentially centrist cast of the A.C.C.F., whose 600 members included Arthur Schlesinger Jr., Reinhold Niebuhr, Robert Oppenheimer, Thornton Wilder, John Steinbeck, Saul Bellow and James Baldwin. The organization’s C.I.A. connection was not known to most members until the late 1960s.'"
"'07-08-12,'0','In one of the short stories from his new collection, Jerry Stahl struggles with some niceties of literary etiquette. The story is about the narrator’s torrid sexual affair with a half-Armenian, half-Guatemalan circus performer named Puray. “I suppose I should tell you now,” he says, a few paragraphs in, “Puray was a little person. Pre-P.C., a midget. A stacked half-pint. Knee-high. But where do you put that in the story? March it out in the first sentence, then that’s what it’s about. ... Then you make the associations. Stereotypes. ... But march the news out in the middle — ‘And, by the way, the love of my life was genetically predisposed to never make 40 inches’ — and what is that — O Henry?”It’s a problem this collection — stuffed with all sorts of oddities — grapples with a lot, although to judge by his opening sentences, Stahl is more of a stick-it-up-front man. “Her husband invented panty shields,” one story begins. “My vagina is a gift from Jesus” is another opener. So is: “I did not mean to sodomize Dick Cheney.” And yes, we really do have a sodomizing Dick Cheney story on our hands. Guy walks into a gun shop in Wyoming to pick up some German pistols. Spots another guy in a black and red hunting cap, flaps down. Gets to talking about barrel length. They go into a back room, a single bed in the corner. Maybe Stahl could have waited until later to break the news that this “burly, pink-thighed, sneering buffalo of love” was in fact the vice president of the United States, but then he would have had to pass up his “Brokeback NeoCon” line and the joke about finding weapons of mass destruction in his pants. And no, in answer to the question: O Henry this isn’t.Stahl has written three novels since “Permanent Midnight,” his memoir about his years as a heroin addict in Hollywood. But in this collection, culled from a variety of sources (some of them 28 years distant), the challenge of embedding himself in the lives and minds of others is sometimes secondary to the urge to turn cartwheels on the page. We get stories about born-again call girls, nudist funerals and all manner of drug-fueled couplings caught in loveless snapshot. In “I’m Dick Felder!” a dentist decides one day to leave his wife and son and hitch a lift with a vanful of teenage runaways. Why is a mystery, both to him and his author — “He could not say for certain what made him this way.” He’s simply a middle-aged squaroid who takes a walk on the wild side: he gets a Mohawk, takes drugs and sleeps with one of the girls, noting, “Things were almost exactly as he had expected.” Really? From someone who has only ever read about punks in Time magazine? Wouldn’t it have been better to have at least one small detail throw his fantasy sideways?That is not Stahl’s way. His fantasists dream up some sticky scenario for themselves and then — bingo! — it gets enacted. (Some of these stories appeared first in Playboy.) In “The Age of Love” a horny teenager finds himself seated next to a recently widowed woman on a plane and, before you know it, he is up to his elbows in her underskirts. “Howzabout I teach you how to love right now so you’ll be ready for it?” she offers, helpfully. Ah, the sound of a woman rocked by grief. Would that she had actually taken the kid aside and told him a thing or two about love, which is something of a four-letter word in this collection, as its title hints. For all their rococo oddity, Stahl’s stories lie curiously flat on the page: they shock, but do not surprise.'"
"'07-08-12,'0','Using what are known as market-neutral strategies designed by computer models, hedge fund traders have been blindsided by a correlation between bonds and stocks that they never expected would occur.Portfolios of this stripe are often known as quantitative funds; some of their most common trades are called statistical arbitrage. These bets are suggested by brilliant mathematicians and academics, using computer models to scour the markets for interesting trading patterns that continue for long periods.For example, a computer might trace the relationship and trading characteristics of two similar assets, like shares of General Motors and Ford. The fund manager then makes trades, going both long and short, based on the way these shares generally trade. If Ford typically trades cheaper than General Motors, the manager would short Ford and buy G.M., capturing what might be small profits, but on a large volume.Another type of trade might involve stocks’ performance immediately after an analyst downgrade or upgrade. Trades are placed on thousands of stocks to try to capitalize on the “typical” behavior that the computer coughs up.Seeing that such bets typically generated profits over long periods left traders believing that their stakes were conservative.The only trouble is, financial markets do not always trade in a way that is typical or predictable. And when they deviate from the norm, all the wonderful and smart trades stop behaving according to plan.In a research report from Lehman Brothers last week, Matthew S. Rothman described the phenomenon. Fund managers experiencing losses in their fixed-income portfolios who were unable to sell their positions then tried to unwind the trades they could sell — that is, stocks. They cashed in the shares they had purchased and bought back the ones they had sold short.The result was that stocks that had historically been weaker became stronger, and vice versa.“It is not simply that model returns are flat (or not working),” Mr. Rothman wrote, “but specifically that the models (ours included) are behaving in the opposite way we would predict and have seen and tested for over very long time periods (45-plus years).”As a result, “risk models are miscalibrated for the current market environment,” he wrote.Compounding the problem, of course, is the borrowed money these funds use to enhance their performance. When things start to unravel, leverage aggravates an already painful fall.Mr. Rothman also pointed out that so many fund managers had the same trades on their books that when they went to cash out of them, the ill effects were exaggerated.The losses that investors are suffering this month, he wrote, are comparable only to those in the 1960s and during the bursting of the Internet bubble. “This appears to be an event with little precedent,” he wrote.None of this would be a problem, of course, if fund managers were not relying so heavily on just that — precedent — to make their decisions. Computer models seem so perfect, so scientific, so flawless, and they are advertised to investors in precisely that fashion. Ingenious models lull investors into a dangerous complacency about the risks they are taking. It is almost as if the models eliminate risk entirely from the markets.But risk is never gone, as investors are recognizing with a jolt. And that is so even if Wall Street assigns conservative-sounding labels to portfolio strategies that are, in fact, aggressive.“They have their standard deviations, correlations, ‘stable value’ and ‘real return’ funds and nothing for what the normal human being would call risk at all,” said Frederick E. Rowe Jr., a money manager at Greenbrier Partners in Dallas. “They’ve taken the word ‘risk’ and hijacked it. The concept of risk — the permanent loss of capital — vanished in the minds of the people who speak the new language.”Risk, and all that it should connote to investors, is back in the language now. Unfortunately, it has brought an awful lot of losses with it.'"
"'07-08-12,'0','Why investigate that way at all when baseball has the exiled crusader Jose Canseco dropping a big name here, another there, as he shamelessly shops another book proposal, by way of the public?My guess, my hope, is that Mitchell understands that the essence of his work has been to examine the core issues of a bastardized culture, explain how baseball as an industry injected itself with the belief that steroids — like peanuts and Cracker Jack — were staples of the sport. It should be apparent to everyone by now that the Popeyes who blew past Maris and Ruth and Aaron were far from the only major leaguers spiking their spinach. In the nontesting era, there was so much to be gained, nothing (it seemed) to be risked, from going on the juice even if you weren’t tracking history or the Hall of Fame.“It’s just so far-fetched, the numbers that those guys are putting up,” Jones said during his Bonds-Rodriguez seminar. “And a lot of it comes from the era that they’re playing in.”Yes, the home run chases and the subsequent revelations put the spotlight on the sluggers, but why is their enhancement, alleged or admitted, more morally reprehensible than anyone else’s?One career year by an average player on the threshold of free agency could bring the contract of a lifetime. A few chemical boosts could mean the difference between major league perks and minor league misery. If cheating is cheating, the same at all institutional levels of productivity, then why would A-Rod, as Jones said, have to “answer the questions” more than others achieving the unexpected or the extraordinary?Jorge Posada is hitting .338 this season — or 51 points higher than his career best — with his 36th birthday coming this week. Beyond baseball’s drug-testing program, should he have to “answer the questions” of the legitimacy police? Should Hideki Matsui have to explain his July power surge? Should Joba Chamberlain, 21, with a body type that Roger Clemens didn’t grow into until he was past 30, have to convince us that his 99-mile-an-hour fastball is au naturel?Before serving a one-game suspension Friday night, Torre said he interpreted Jones’s comments to mean that “anybody is going to come under scrutiny.” But Jones didn’t talk about anybody. He connected A-Rod to Bonds and was shocked when headlines rolled off the presses. How naïve is that?Jones cited suspicions about A-Rod that were raised self-servingly in a recent radio interview by Canseco, while adding that he was inclined to believe that A-Rod’s home run numbers were pure — which is akin to calling a news conference to announce that your so-called friend probably doesn’t beat his wife.This isn’t to say Canseco’s first literary work wasn’t enlightening, on the money, with arguably greater impact than the journalistically brilliant “Game of Shadows.” Without Canseco, maybe there is no March 2005 Congressional hearing on steroids, and Mark McGwire winds up sitting between Cal Ripken and Tony Gwynn last month in Cooperstown, N.Y.But let’s not forget that Canseco has an agenda, and knows what he has to do to keep himself relevant: Drop names, big names; and feed the insatiable public appetite for celebrity news. Jones should not have played along. It wasn’t fair to A-Rod, and it didn’t raise the more important institutional questions the Mitchell investigation had better answer.'"
"'07-08-12,'0','“In some ways, yes, what I’m looking for is definitely recognition in the States,” Federer said. “I hope they appreciate my achievements and results, but I don’t want to force it on the public because that is always up to them to decide.”He is not David Beckham, imposing his global celebrity and Posh wife and exposed pecs on America’s soccer simpletons for the profit of Brand Beckham. Instead, Federer has moved judiciously into our culture, with more ads and more victories, becoming an excellent houseguest.For one, he doesn’t break things — as in fan trust. With his fusion style, all at once high tech and retro, Federer has captured 11 Grand Slam titles in four years without surfacing in the tableau of sports scandals. No doping, dogs or deceit.He is not an ill-mannered squatter on our landscape, either, revealing no symptoms of antisocial behavior. He doesn’t lord his greatness over, say, a headwaiter. Federer actually smiled at the absurdity of a recent report that praised him for refusing to pull a don’t-you-know-who-I-am moment at a crowded restaurant, as if acting like a normal person were heroic. “I knew I was too late,” Federer said.He is not the kind of company who will come home sauced with a groupie one night — and land in the tabloids tomorrow. By all accounts, Federer’s big escape is downtime with his girlfriend of seven years, Mirka Vavrinec. “Honestly, I’d rather have tea with Mirka and speak about life,” he said.He is a metro male on an Obama scale, isn’t he? Federer is a chatty Swiss who is curious about others. Many elite athletes use headphones as a convenient way to hide from the public, tuning out autograph requests or questions or even teammates. Federer owns about a half-dozen iPods but has little use for them.“I think they’re a great creation, but if you put them in,” said Federer, pointing to his ears, “you can’t speak to anyone. You’re isolating yourself, and I don’t like that.”Federer is a worldly boarder who prefers to leave a tidy legacy behind him when he exits. As a Unicef ambassador, he visited India last Christmas on the second anniversary of the destructive tsunami of December 2004. He rode hundreds of miles across the country, moved by the faces of determined people, impressed by the meticulous organization of the villages and sickened by a car ride turned thrill ride.“They were driving so fast,” Federer said, widening his eyes. “And there was one lane going this way and one going that way and they were overtaking all the time. So you’d go heading right at another car, then they turned the wheel just in time. At one point, I think I’m not even looking anymore. You look out the side, but you get sick.”He isn’t a backseat driver. So Federer won’t be barging into America this month — as the hardcourt season peaks with the United States Open — pushing an agenda other than winning another major and, if it’s meant to be, winning over the public.He is on his way at least commercially. Tiger is not only his Gillette co-star but provides the voiceover to Federer’s Nike ads. Not a bad icon to provide Federer’s long-awaited introduction to the mainstream masses, from the Corn Belt to each coast.Maybe there is a place for a Swiss to fill an American craving for a superstar of authentic quality this summer, one who is neither polarizing nor perplexing. Federer is, at least on stage, not an illusion. What a refreshing change.“I take being a role model seriously,” he said. “So I hope I can fit that spot that is maybe missing at the moment. I don’t know.”To date, Federer has never broken, trashed or ruined anything. He is a host’s dream guest.'"

"'07-08-13,'0','Separately, the Federal Reserve today added more money into the financial system, providing $2 billion in loans in an effort to help calm the markets.Financial stocks were a drag on the market today. Countrywide Financial, the nation’s largest mortgage lender, closed at $26.61, down 4 percent, and Fannie Mae was off 3.5 percent at $64.12.Technology equipment and telecommunications stocks were among the strongest performers. EMC, the data storage company, was up 7.5 percent to $19.05 ahead of the initial public offering of its VMware unit this week. Hewlett-Packard gained 2.6 percent to $48.43, and Sprint Nextel was up 3.4 percent at $19.49.In Europe today, stock indexes in Paris and Frankfurt finished about 2 percent higher, and British stocks were up almost 3 percent.The day’s tone was set in Asia, where some of the region’s biggest markets sprang back today after a slide last Friday. They were helped by the slight recovery in American markets after the close of Asian markets late last Friday.Reflecting some of the inverse logic that seems to govern markets of late, Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Average index closed slightly higher on news that the country’s economic growth was slowing, and that the central bank had lent an additional $5 billion to banks to ensure adequate funds in the money market.Central banks from Australia to the United States made similar loans today. The European Central Bank added $65.3 billion to the markets today.Last week, concerns about growing losses in the ailing market for subprime mortgages in the United States prompted many investors in Asia to take funds out of any investments that were considered relatively risky, either because they involved emerging markets or because they were tied to high levels of debt.The recovery today encouraged some analysts to sound a note of optimism. They pointed to a growing awareness that Asia is still flush with funds and doesn’t suffer from the same reliance on debt as investors do in Europe and the United States.“The worst of it’s behind us in Asian markets,” said Adrian Mowat, a strategist at J.P. Morgan in Hong Kong. “Asian monetary systems have been relatively flush with cash and growth here is typically being funded by earnings — household and corporate, rather than debt funding.”Others, however, warned that more surprises could be in store for the region and that today’s recovery might in retrospect be only a temporary respite.“We think the volatility will continue for a while,” said Hans Goetti, head of research strategy at Citi Private Bank in Singapore.There was, therefore, still an air of uncertainty in Asia today, analysts said, with investors selling stocks in some smaller markets and buying stocks in larger economies, especially financial and commodity-related stocks that had been pushed down last week.“As information flows out, people are waiting to see what happens next,” said Rahul Malhotra, managing director for private banking in the Middle East and Pacific Rim at Merrill Lynch in Singapore.Merrill’s advice to its clients, Mr. Malhotra said, was not to join the panic selling, advice he said that most appeared to be taking.'"

"'07-08-13,'0','NEOSHO, Mo., Aug. 12 (AP) — A gunman opened fire in the sanctuary of a church here Sunday, killing three people and wounding several others, the authorities said.As many as 50 people were briefly held hostage at the church, First Congregational, until the gunman surrendered, a town spokeswoman, Desiree Bridges, said.About four or five people were known to be wounded, Chief David McCracken of the Neosho police said, and several others who were injured fled the scene.The gunman was being held at the Newton County Jail, but the police did not release any information about his identity. Ms. Bridges said he was related to someone in the church, but declined to elaborate. No charges had been filed Sunday, Chief McCracken said.The chief said an incident on Saturday night involving the suspect and a family who attended the church fueled the shooting.“At this point though, we don’t have any information more than that,” he said.The shooting followed the 1 p.m. service, which is held in Spanish. About 50 people were in the church at the time.The gunman surrendered to the authorities after about 10 minutes of negotiation.“At the time that the rescue attempt was successful, we had approximately 20 people in the sanctuary still,” Chief McCracken said. “We had some people who escaped the crime scene prior to the police arrival that were wounded, and we had some people escape during the process and at the time of the rescue.”'"
"'07-08-13,'0','The crisis has reverberated throughout the financial markets, but the greatest impact has been felt by investors in mortgage securities and those involved with corporate buyouts. Also, hundreds of thousands of homeowners are facing resetting rates on loans and may not be able to refinance easily into another loan.Last week, the Federal Reserve and other central banks lent $293 billion to banks to ensure that there was enough money to lend to borrowers.But even skeptical market watchers acknowledge that stocks, which average Americans buy through mutual funds, appear less vulnerable than the market for complex debt investments typically bought by hedge funds, pension funds and insurance companies. Since bottoming out in late 2002, stocks have risen at a more modest pace than in the 1990s — an average of 13 percent a year. And despite recent losses, the Dow is still up 6.2 percent since Jan. 1.The ratio of stock prices to corporate profits for the Standard & Poor’s 500 stock index is 16.8, slightly above the average of 15.7 since 1935, but below the average of 22.8 since 1988.On numerous occasions in recent decades, stocks have fallen 6 percent or more in a short period. In most cases — in 1998, 1999 and 2003, for example — stocks began rising again soon. In a few cases, most notably 2000, the initial declines signaled larger problems.There is no way to predict where the market will go, but many investment specialists say the economy is fundamentally strong. Companies are adding jobs and real wages are rising. (On Monday morning, Japanese stocks increased slightly, with the Nikkei 225 index up 0.48 percent at midday.)Still, the fact that the markets in the United States are falling despite a vibrant global economy has been unnerving to individual investors.“How concerned should I be?” asked Shanna Rendon, a 53-year-old retired lab technician in Grand Junction, Colo. “I am managing the finances for our retirement — and I don’t want to lose money.”She and her husband lost more than $1 million of their retirement nest egg in the crash that followed the boom of the late 1990s. But they have been able to recover over the last few years as the stock market rallied.“I look back at the tech wreck and see overvalued companies,” she said. “Now, I am looking at a country where the economy has a problem because of a lot of credit. What is going to prop up the economy with all that debt?”In the short term, investors like Ms. Rendon can probably expect more turmoil. Expectations of future volatility — though they are far lower by one popular measure than they were early in this decade and in the late 1990s — have surged to their highest levels in more than four years.“Certainly for young folks, this is a shocker,” Jim T. Swanson, chief investment strategist at MFS Investments in Boston, said about volatility. “But the 20-year numbers suggest that this is a return to normal.”Individual investors should figure out how comfortable they are with the risks of their investments, while considering their financial circumstances and investment goals, advisers say.Many financial experts suggest investors consider moving their money to less risky investments like Treasury notes and blue-chip stocks, which they expect to now perform better than junk bonds and smaller stocks.But they caution against impulsively buying and selling stocks based on a short-term market swing. “None of us are going to be able to time our moves,” said Liz Ann Sonders, chief investment strategist at Charles Schwab. “If you take a more systematic approach, then you are sort of putting yourself on the right side of the market. But it’s not human nature to do that. We love to ride our winners until something happens.”For now, anxiety is particularly high among well-heeled investors in some hedge funds that have reported losses. Many are flocking for the exits, forcing portfolio managers to sell otherwise solid investments.And the demands could intensify this week: Wednesday marks 45 days before the end of the quarter, the deadline by which most hedge fund investors must notify the funds if they want to redeem their investments.Stock prices could also decline further if investors no longer expect the big premiums that private equity firms have been paying to buy public companies.Financial stocks, which often lead the market, are down 10 percent for the year. Many banks and brokerages were riding high in recent years because of the lucrative fees they earned during the buyout boom. A big test will come when bankers have to raise money for big private equity acquisitions like the ones that are pending for the First Data Corporation and Sallie Mae.In the mortgage market, the prognosis is expected to be bleak for some time. A glut of unsold properties in many parts of the country suggests that home prices have further to fall.Optimists, however, note that the American economy is running smoothly. Unemployment is at 4.6 percent, near record lows.Borrowing costs are rising but are still cheap compared with historical rates. Public companies are flush with cash and corporate profits are growing at a robust pace. Investors have trillions of dollars sitting on the sidelines, waiting for the right time to jump into the market.Larry Reno, a retired government worker who lives in Atlanta, is among the would-be bargain hunters. “There are a lot of stocks out there that are getting beat up and have good fundamentals,” said Mr. Reno, who calls himself a long-term investor. “To me, it’s like the day after Christmas, when all the department stores put the stuff on sale.”To place the current period in context, many experts are studying the credit crisis in 1998, when Russia defaulted on its debts and the hedge fund Long-Term Capital Management collapsed. “In 1998, 60 subprime companies went out of business,” said Meredith A. Whitney, an analyst with CIBC World Markets. “And that didn’t send our economy into a recession.”In fact, the stock market climbed higher after the Fed intervened to save Long-Term Capital and the International Monetary Fund lent money to Russia.But other market watchers contend that employment and profits are often lagging indicators and that the American economy is already slowing.As adjustable-rate mortgages are reset, many homeowners will face higher monthly housing payments. That could force some families to cut back on spending.Sallie L. Krawcheck, head of global wealth management at Citigroup, said investors should be “making adjustments for risk and, if appropriate, exploring possible buying opportunities.”They should focus on whether “the market volatility bleeds over into the health and behavior of consumer,” she said. “That is the key for the real economy.”'"
"'07-08-13,'0','The move to push leaders of warring sects together comes at a time of profound political tension in Baghdad. Accusing the Shiite-led Maliki government of sectarianism and incompetence, 11 cabinet ministers have boycotted his government in recent weeks: six from the main Sunni bloc, the Iraqi Consensus Front, and five from a group of mixed sects loyal to the former prime minister, Ayad Allawi.Six other cabinet positions once occupied by members of the party loyal to the Shiite cleric Moktada al-Sadr also remain empty because Parliament has not approved replacements, meaning that roughly half of the government’s ministries lack leaders who work with the prime minister’s office.Parliament also recently resisted Mr. Maliki’s demands to stay in session, and took August off.Many American officials in Iraq have grown so frustrated with the government’s lack of progress that they have publicly focused their hopes almost exclusively on the individual provinces, as President Bush did in a news conference last week.The prospects for Mr. Maliki’s meeting, however, are hard to divine. Sunni leaders from the Iraqi Consensus Front have said they would sit around the table with Mr. Maliki. Even if the summit meeting ends only with an announcement of future meetings, some Western officials said, it would probably qualify as progress by the Americans.There are signs that Mr. Maliki’s threat to replace ministers could be potent; because there was minimal Sunni participation in the 2005 elections, Sunni leaders have been tagged as unrepresentative of their communities.One Western official who works closely with Iraqi politicians said that even before the prime minister’s threat on Sunday, elected Sunni leaders worried that they could be pushed out by leaders from the Anbar Salvation Council and other Sunni Arab tribal groups that have recently allied with the American military in its fight against Sunni extremists.In one possible sign of that insecurity, Adnan al-Dulaimi, the head of the main Sunni bloc, recently met with many of the tribal leaders in Anbar.But there are few signs that any of Iraq’s factions will ultimately be willing to compromise. Mr. Maliki suggested that he would not consider bringing any of the ministers back into his government, or even discuss their complaints, until they agreed to act on some of his requests.“We will talk not only of the demands of this or that side,” he said. “We will also talk about deals and duties, like an agreement to pass some laws and increase the activity of Parliament.”Sunni officials, meanwhile, say that even if deals emerge from the meeting, they could not trust Mr. Maliki’s government to implement them. Promises to deliver government services in Sunni areas of Baghdad still remain largely unfulfilled.In a written statement on Sunday addressed to the Arab world, Mr. Dulaimi, the Sunni coalition leader, claimed that Shiite death squads and Iranian agents were conducting “genocide” against Sunnis with the tacit approval of government institutions.“We believe that we have reached a point of desperation with this government, and there are no ways to continue with it,” Mr. Dulaimi said in an interview on Sunday night. “We decided to leave the government and absolutely will never return back.”Meanwhile, the American military on Sunday announced the deaths of five soldiers on Saturday. Four were killed when a booby-trapped house exploded just south of the capital, the military said; news agencies reported that the attack was an elaborate ambush that started with a sniper attack to draw in the soldiers. The fifth soldier was killed by small-arms fire southeast of the capital, the military said.'"
"'07-08-13,'0','Irene Morgan Kirkaldy, whose defiance of white supremacy while traveling through the Upper South in the summer of 1944 led to a Supreme Court decision outlawing segregated seating on interstate bus lines, died Friday in Hayes, Va. She was 90.The cause was complications of Alzheimer’s disease, said her granddaughter Janine Bacquie.Irene Morgan’s fight against segregation took place a decade before the modern civil rights movement changed America. Taken up by the N.A.A.C.P. and argued before the Supreme Court by Thurgood Marshall, later the court’s first black justice, it proved a forerunner to Rosa Parks’s storied refusal to yield her seat on a city bus in Montgomery, Ala.Mrs. Morgan, a worker in a plant that made World War II bombers and the mother of two small children, was returning to her home in Baltimore aboard a Greyhound bus in July 1944 after a visit to her mother in Gloucester County, Va.When the bus grew crowded, the driver told her to give her seat to a white person. Mrs. Morgan refused, and when a sheriff’s deputy tried to take her off the bus in Saluda, Va., she resisted.“He put his hand on me to arrest me, so I took my foot and kicked him,” she recalled in “You Don’t Have to Ride Jim Crow!” a 1995 public television documentary. “He was blue and purple and turned all colors. I started to bite him, but he looked dirty, so I couldn’t bite him. So all I could do was claw and tear his clothes.”'"
"'07-08-13,'0','Wadsworth, 32, has a chiseled body and his resolve is strong, but it is too soon to assess whether he can resume his career, or give the Jets’ defense a boost.Wadsworth said he could not measure himself in terms of quickness or any of the usual athletic indicators, based on where he left off in December 2000.“Nah, I can’t do that, because I’m not 23,” he said, laughing. “It’s all about production, getting it done, being efficient and doing it that way.”Wadsworth had two tackles Friday. He called his return to the pro game enjoyable, which is all he can ask for at this early stage. He offered no complaints about the state of his body in the aftermath, and he practiced Sunday without any apparent problems.“I wasn’t as excited as I thought I would be,” he said. “I just knew it was another step toward the goal of trying to get back in the N.F.L. and make a team. I was just so happy to be out there. It’s another step in the process. So many steps to take. And so, just another big hurdle, man. Another big hurdle.”Wadsworth is keeping his day-to-day goals modest — show improvement, try not to repeat a mistake. If the Jets let him go, Wadsworth said he might pursue his comeback elsewhere, but he is not prepared to move his family multiple times if the quest seems futile.“I’ve come a long way,” Wadsworth said. “I just hope they give me a shot. That’s all I’m asking for.”Ten downs is hardly enough time to get a feel for the game, but there are three exhibition games left and, presumably, ample time for Wadsworth to make an impact — preferably on the sternum of a quarterback.THOMAS JONES INJURED Thomas Jones, the Jets’ No. 1 running back, appeared to hurt his right lower leg early in Sunday’s practice. He was lined up against linebacker Brad Kassell and suddenly dropped to the turf as he planted his feet. Jones held his right ankle for a few moments, then retied his shoe. He was able to walk off the field without assistance but did not return. The Jets did not make Jones available or give information about the injury.A PETE KENDALL PLOT TWIST The Pete Kendall saga took a curious turn Sunday afternoon when he played several snaps at center. Kendall, who is stewing over a contract standoff, seemed bewildered by the move. “I thought the organization had already decided how well I play center,” he said sarcastically. Kendall, who typically plays guard, said he was informed of the move when he arrived at practice. It could suggest that the Jets want to keep Kendall and are evaluating ways to use him, or it could mean they intend to trade him to a team that needs a versatile lineman. “I have no idea what their plans are,” Kendall said. EXTRA POINTS The Jets waived receiver Jesse Pellot-Rosa and offensive lineman Andrew Wicker. They re-signed receiver Dante Ridgeway.'"
"'07-08-13,'0','Moreover, bankers and investors say, the strategies employed tend to be not only duplicable but broadly followed — the result being a packlike tendency that has helped increase market volatility and, for some hedge funds, has led to losses in the last month.Wild swings in stock prices have become the norm as fears about the mortgage securities market have expanded into the broader markets. Last week, the Dow Jones industrial average was sharply higher on Monday and Wednesday, only to drop 387 points on Thursday, eventually ending the week about where it began.A common thread has often been a rise or fall in prices late in the day, a pattern that many analysts attribute to computer models, which are driving a much larger volume of the trading.Mr. Chan said this predilection for lemming-style buying or selling from investors using similar computer models could turn what would normally be a market setback into a wider contagion.“If all the models say buy, who is going to say sell? There is just not enough money on the other side,” he said.The problems of these quantitative funds mirror those of the hedge fund industry as a whole — many funds have seen sharp declines in the last couple of months as the credit markets have dried up. Some quantitative funds could potentially have their worst year on record.Despite the large sums of money involved, ranging from $250 billion to $500 billion, according to industry estimates, the club of quantitative investors is a small, exclusive one that bridges the trading desks of investment banks and some of the country’s largest hedge funds.One might call it six degrees of quantitative investing.Clifford S. Asness, who has a Ph.D. in finance from the University of Chicago, is the founder of AQR Capital Management, a quantitative hedge fund that, according to investors, has had a 13 percent loss so far this month.Mr. Asness is also a founder of Goldman Sachs’s troubled Global Alpha fund, which controls about $9 billion. The Alpha fund has suffered an 11 percent reversal this month, giving it a decline for the year that is approaching 30 percent, sparking speculation that Goldman would liquidate the fund. Goldman calls the speculation “categorically untrue.”On a smaller scale, Tykhe Capital, another hedge fund that uses quantitative techniques, was down 19 percent in August. The founders of Tykhe are from D.E. Shaw & Company, the giant hedge fund that manages $35 billion via a broad reliance on quantitative, as well as other, strategies and whose founder, David E. Shaw, who has a Ph.D. from Stanford, originally came from Morgan Stanley.Hedge funds as a whole have grown exponentially and now manage about $1.7 trillion, more than double the amount five years ago.In one respect the swoon of these computer-reliant funds is the result of managers, who are faced with a deluge of investor money seeking accelerated returns, using their models to make higher risk market bets by following day-to-day trends. It is an approach that seems to run contrary to the original philosophy underlying a quantitative approach, called statistical arbitrage.Narrowly defined, statistical arbitrage involves a fairly straightforward investment strategy, like the rapid-fire buying of one stock and the selling short of another so as to use the computer’s speed to identify and make money from even the most minute price discrepancies. Such a strategy will generally provide liquidity to the market by buying stocks on the way down and selling them short on the way up. In so doing, it provides a dose of calming, computerized sang-froid to markets in the grip of panic or euphoria.But such strategies rarely promise high returns, so quantitative investors have broadened their computer models to include strategies for investing in more risky areas like mortgage-backed securities, derivatives and commodities.“You can build a computer model for anything that is tradable,” Mr. Chan said. To some extent, that explains the outbreak of losses in these funds.With many of these new assets being highly illiquid and with the funds themselves having used considerable amounts of borrowed money to enhance their returns, losses have been magnified as worried investors have demanded to pull their money out.In a letter to investors this week, James H. Simons, the founder of Renaissance Technologies, the most highly regarded of the quantitative funds, gave voice to what he described as “unusual” market conditions. Mr. Simons, who received a Ph.D. in mathematics from the University of California, Berkeley, acknowledged what a difficult month August had been, with his RIEF down close to 9 percent for the month.For an investor who reportedly earned $1.6 billion last year and whose flagship Medallion fund had an average annual return of over 30 percent since 1988, it was a surprising reversal.“We cannot predict the duration of the current environment,” Mr. Simons wrote. “But usually such behavior causes first pain and then opportunity. Our basic plan is to stay the course.”'"
"'07-08-13,'0','The plan, circulating this month among analysts in the European Commission, will be presented to the commissioners in November.If the commissioners endorse the proposal, it will be forwarded in 2008 to the 27 European telecommunications ministers and the European Parliament for their approval.But while broad consumer support helped push political passage of the mobile phone roaming limits, a plan to create a Brussels superagency that could intervene in domestic markets lacks natural consumer appeal and faces formidable industry opposition.“We believe that competition is more vibrant than ever, and that functional separation would be a terrible idea,” said Michael Bartholomew, director of the European Telecommunications Network Operators Association, which represents 41 operators in 34 countries.He also questioned the motivations of the plan and how well it would work.“Why would the commission want to consider this?” he said. “There’s no successful experience with this anywhere in the world.”In the European Union, such separation has been used in Britain only, where national regulators forced British Telecom in 2005 to create separate network and services subsidiaries.Supporters of the move said that the separation helped triple the number of phone lines in Britain, which were later leased by competing telecommunications companies. Opponents said the separation created market uncertainty and led to record low levels of investment in British telecommunications networks.Ms. Reding raised the idea of separating dominant former monopolies from their physical networks during a speech to a German industry group in Brussels in June 2006.The impetus for her comments was Germany’s plan to defy European Union law by barring Deutsche Telekom competitors from its new high-speed V.D.S.L. (very high bit-rate D.S.L.) broadband network, financed partly by government money.Since then, German lawmakers have excluded competitors from V.D.S.L., and Ms. Reding has started a lawsuit against Germany in the European Court of Justice.During a June 13 speech this year in Düsseldorf, Ms. Reding repeated her plans to centralize decision-making in Brussels, saying that a new Brussels regulator should be able to impose changes in any European Union country that decides to thwart the union’s law.“Where effective infrastructural competition has little prospect of taking root over the medium to long term,” Ms. Reding said at a seminar sponsored by the German financial newspaper Handelsblatt, “national regulators could, in close agreement with the commission, make use of this new remedial measure.”With national interests and jobs at stake, European Union laws are often ignored or slowly adopted by member states, where national regulators are often appointed by the same governments that own stakes in former telephone monopolies.In Germany, for example, the telecommunications regulator took more than four years to conduct a study that concluded that Deutsche Telekom, still 31 percent owned by the German government, had illegally barred competitors from leasing access at reasonable rates to its network in rural areas. France completed the same study, ordered by the European Union, within two years.Even the German regulator’s belated finding this year that Deutsche Telekom must lease competitors access to its backbone network is still expected to take months, if not years, to carry out, said Ms. Godlovitch of the telecommunications association.'"
"'07-08-13,'0','Three-Legged Dog, a media and theater group in downtown Manhattan, was one of the many groups large and small that reaped benefits from the new system. The organization received $28,500, its first operating stipend from the city.Other non-city-owned institutions did similarly well. The Joyce Theater, which presents dance in Chelsea and SoHo, saw its city financing rise to $155,000 from $45,000 last year. The Queens County Farm Museum got $245,000, up from $76,000. The American Folk Art Museum received $225,000, compared with $6,000. The Noguchi Museum in Long Island City got $200,000, up from $140,000. The Roundabout Theater Company received $163,000, up from $134,000.“On the program side we were really trying to reform a funding process — it was unclear, it was unpredictable, it was unfair,” said Kate D. Levin, the cultural affairs commissioner.“In the past, dollar amounts were dependent on lobbying — people didn’t have equal access,” she added. “When you move to a merit-based process, you start being able to get more money to more organizations and reflect the strength and diversity of the field.”The money going to the Mama Foundation, which has a school as well as performing programs, will enhance the organization’s efforts to teach gospel music and its history to teenagers, a program that now involves about 300 students, up from 70. “So much music has been taken out of the schools that we thought it was necessary to supplement it,” said Vy Higginsen, the foundation’s chief executive and executive director.For the members of the so-called Cultural Institutions Group — including organizations like the Brooklyn Academy of Music, the Queens Museum of Art and the Metropolitan Museum of Art — the increases were not as large, and some were worried that their allocations were limited to one year. “We were generally pleased,” said Tom Finkelpearl, the chairman of the Cultural Institutions Group, but he added: “We’re concerned about the next fiscal year. A lot of funding was one-time funding.”The Brooklyn Academy of Music received about $4 million, close to what it got last year. “We didn’t really gain, but we didn’t lose,” said Karen Brooks Hopkins, the academy’s president. “The real question is, in this new world where we don’t have a budget dance, what can we do to not lose ground?”Starting in the 2009 fiscal year, which begins in July 2008, the 34 arts groups will be guaranteed 90 percent of their funds. The rest will be conditioned on their performance through a new evaluation and accountability process called CultureStat. City-owned arts groups will be reviewed in areas including board governance and financial management and may receive a portion of the 10 percent balance even if they do not qualify for the whole amount.Because of the push and pull between the mayor and the council that was normal in the past, arts groups often did not learn how much they were getting until February. In the future, Ms. Levin said, 75 percent of organizations will receive word by July and will get payments by August. Elizabeth Egbert, the president and chief executive of the Staten Island Museum, said that this was a significant step. “This year, for the first time, we received word of the final budget number in time to include an accurate number in our own budget, which helped tremendously in planning,” she said. “Since our board votes on the museum budget in June each year, knowing the city allocation in advance, rather than in January, six months into the fiscal year, is obviously a better situation.”In addition, groups with budgets of $250,000 or more will eventually be accorded three-year figures, so they can count on a certain level of funding. Organizations with smaller budgets will continue to receive annual appropriations.Some 170 groups also used to get a fixed amount of money every year as “line items” that were written into the budget and have been frozen since 1989. Those have been eliminated.Instead arts groups have to make a case for themselves based on the work that they do and the public service they provide. “We’ve been able to be more responsive to the needs of organizations that are extremely different,” Ms. Levin said.She said the city was now essentially able to say: “We hear you. We hear you have this particular need at this particular moment.”'"
"'07-08-13,'0','Last Thursday, inboxes around the world were flooded with crude PDF documents promoting the stock of the Prime Time Group, a tiny Florida company with cellphone and convenience-store interests, among others. “Insider Buying Alert!!!” the messages began, promising that the stock would “move like a comet.”The messages were apparently of a familiar type: the “pump and dump” swindle, whose creators seek to drive up a stock’s price so that they can unload their holdings. But several things set this effort apart. First was its size. The wave of e-mail amounted to the most spam ever observed in a single day by Postini, an e-mail-management company that has tracked such data for about two years.The scheme was also surprisingly successful, judging by Prime Time’s stock price. The wave of spam e-mail peaked at 9:33 a.m. on Thursday. By 12:30 p.m., the stock price had hit 11 cents, up 25 percent from its close on Wednesday, and 84 percent from the start of trading on Monday.By Friday, the stock’s value fell sharply. And that day the company said that it had had no involvement in the spam attack.'"
"'07-08-13,'0','Nickelodeon is expected to announce today that Noggin, the daytime commercial-free preschool network, and the N, a nighttime advertising-supported network for adolescents and teenagers, will become 24-hour stand-alone networks and no longer share channel space.The split, planned for the end of the year, will resonate particularly in the intense competition for the 9- to 14-year-olds and 12- to 17-year-olds, whose loyalties are now divided among Walt Disney’s Disney Channel — home of the series “Hannah Montana” and the powerhouse “High School Musical” and a sequel that is being shown on Friday — and ABC Family; Nickelodeon’s Nick, MTV and the N; and the broadcast network the CW, among others.By inhabiting its own space, the N, the five-year-old network whose marquee program is “Degrassi: The Next Generation,” will become the only cable network specifically aimed to the age groups, potentially giving it an advantage over its rivals, whose schedules also include programs for other demographic groups. The network will use the channel space currently occupied by Nickelodeon’s Games and Sports, which will become a broadband channel and may align itself more closely with local community sports.Splitting the networks has been considered “for years,” said Cyma Zarghami, president, Nickelodeon and MTVN Kids and Family Group at Viacom, commenting in an interview that the two “are stuck together a little bit awkwardly; there’s somewhat of a disconnect between the preschool audience and the teen audience at night.”By dividing into distinct channels, Ms. Zarghami said, the two brands will make it easier for viewers to find what they want whenever they want it. The networks, she added, also hope to slightly broaden their audiences, by drawing more parents to Noggin in the evening hours and more 9- to 14-year-olds to the N during the day. The median age for the mostly female viewers of the N is 16.The Disney Channel, with a tween-focused prime-time lineup, and ABC Family, aimed in prime time toward older teenagers with programs like “Kyle XY” and “Greek,” will still have an important leg up on the N after the split: Those networks are available in some 92 million homes with cable, compared with 60 million for the N, and both roundly trump the N in ratings in prime time, when the most viewers are available.'"

"'07-08-14,'0','A race winner, even if he is one of 12 drivers in the Chase, will not receive the 10-point bonus during the playoff.Stewart, the winner of Sunday’s race in Watkins Glen, N.Y., capitalized on a spin made by Gordon on the next-to-last lap of the race — while Gordon was zealously trying to protect his lead.“It was all about winning today, because we want those extra 10 bonus points right now,” Stewart, who is fourth in the standings, said after the race.The drivers who appear to have Chase berths locked — as Stewart and Gordon do — may as well try to do everything they can to win a race now, because second place will not be worth much when the Chase begins, Stewart said.“You might as well kiss your aunt with the hairy mustache,” he said. “It’s not something you really care about.”As if to drive home the point, Carl Edwards, who moved into second place in Sunday’s race when Gordon spun out, tried making an audacious pass on Stewart in the final lap. Edwards drove too hard into a turn and sailed through a patch of gravel.“I knew I wouldn’t lose too many spots if I did mess up,” Edwards said after finishing eighth.He is fifth in the standings, but he has won only one race this season — on June 17 at Michigan International Speedway, where the Nextel Cup series returns Sunday. Chase qualifying ends with races in Bristol, Tenn.; Fontana, Calif.; and Richmond, Va.Gordon was clearly upset with himself for making the mistake that ended with the spin. He led 51 of the first 88 laps Sunday, and Stewart was the only driver he had to worry about at the end of the race.“Had I won, I would have gained 10 points, so I would have been 20 points more ahead of him than I am now,” Gordon said.Ten points may seem insignificant in a system that awards points by the thousands. A driver can wipe out a 10-point deficit simply by finishing sixth instead of ninth in one race. But the top drivers are looking for momentum to carry forward.“When you see a small bobble from someone, you’ve got to pounce on it,” Johnson said. “When you have fresh tires or cold brakes, you’ve got to make the banzai move to get in position, and I think that’s just because the level of competition is getting closer and closer between the top 10.”'"
"'07-08-14,'0','A jump in energy prices caused prices paid at the producer level to rise more than expected last month despite falling food prices and small price increases for many other goods.The Labor Department said today that the producer price index — the government’s calculation of the prices businesses charge one another — rose 0.6 percent in July after dropping 0.2 percent in June. A separate measure of prices that excludes food and energy prices, which are subject to large and volatile swings, registered a more benign 0.1 percent increase last month. It rose 0.3 percent in June.The producer price numbers fell in line with the big-picture trend of inflation in recent months and suggested that while price increases on the whole are getting more modest, they are still prone to bouncing around unpredictably. Over all, producer prices rose 4 percent from July 2006 to July 2007, the Labor Department said, and 2.3 percent excluding food and energy.The cost of gasoline rose 3.2 percent last month after falling 3.9 percent the month before. Other energy prices also ticked up. The cost of electricity rose 1.8 percent, and the host of heating gas was up 2.7 percent.The inflation data is not likely to tip monetary policy makers at the Federal Reserve in one direction or another as they try to decide where to set interest rates. But some economists said the Fed could find the report encouraging because it did not raise any new red flags.'"
"'07-08-14,'0','Mattel’s statement about the recall did not specify where the magnetic-based toys had been manufactured, but the Consumer Product Safety Commission said today that all were from China.The company said it was working with the safety commission and other regulatory agencies worldwide, as well as with retailers to remove the affected products from stores.“We take this very seriously,” said Robert A. Eckert, the chairman and chief executive of Mattel, on a conference call this afternoon. “We’re reaching out to people today and, particularly parents. We’ve changed our own testing procedures, so we’ll be extra vigilant in this area.”Mattel has a reputation for being one of the most conscientious toy makers and is known for having sophisticated inspection and testing systems at many of its China factories to guard against flawed, defective or tainted products.But the latest recall could feed growing international worries about the quality and safety of consumer products made in China.It would follow a series of other recalls by manufacturers this year involving a wide range of products from contaminated pet food ingredients to defective tires to tainted Chinese-made toothpaste.Jim Walter, senior vice president for worldwide quality assurance at Mattel, said in a statement issued today that Mattel was putting in place a “strengthened three-point check system” to guard against lead-based paint. It will permit only paint from certified supplied, and require every batch to be tested; it will tighten controls throughout the production process and conduct random inspections; and it will test every production run of finished toys.In an interview later, Mr. Walter described a visit to China and Hong Kong last week in which he met with all of Mattel’s contract manufacturers to reiterate Mattel’s quality rules. “The message was very clear,” he said. “If you cannot do these things, please let us know. No problem, but you won’t be doing business with us.”Mr. Walter said Mattel had long had quality checks in place, but added that now “we do realize the need for increased vigilance, increased surveillance.”The company said today that 65 percent of its toys are made in China.Earlier this month, Mattel recalled over one million Chinese-made toys, including Sesame Street and Dora the Explorer products made by its Fisher-Price unit, because they were contaminated with excessive levels of lead paint, which if ingested could pose health hazards to children.Mattel’s stock was down about 2 percent in trading this afternoon.Mattel executives said that the $30 million charge announced earlier this month includes the cost of today’s recall. But costs of doing business at the toymaker will go up as the new tests are integrated into its systems, Mr. Eckert said.“We will have costs associated with this increased testing and vigilance, but what’s important here is we do not put a price on safety,” Mr. Eckert said.Today, before the latest recalls were announced, Mattel ran full-page ads in The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal and USA Today that featured a letter from Mr. Eckert.“Nothing is more important than the safety of our children,” the letter begins.“Our long record of safety at Mattel is why we’re one of the most trusted names with parents,” it says. “And I am confident that the actions we are taking now will maintain that trust.”The toymaker said the latest defective Chinese toys were produced by Early Light Industrial Company, which it said subcontracted the painting to another Chinese vendor, Hong Li Da (HLD). “While the painting subcontractor, HLD, was required to utilize paint supplied directly from Early Light, it instead violated Mattel’s standards and utilized paint from a nonauthorized third-party supplier,” Mattel said.Mr. Eckert said today that Mattel considers Early Light Industrial as much a “victim” of the subcontractor as Mattel was.Mattel said Lee Der Industrial, a contract manufacturer based in southern China, was responsible for producing the toys that contained excessive levels of lead paint in the initial recall.Mattel stopped accepting goods from the contractor, and last week the Chinese government revoked Lee Der’s export license.Mr. Eckert said in an interview that Mattel had been able to recover the costs of its recall of the products made by Lee Der Industrial. “My understanding is that Lee Der is out of business,” he added.In a further twist, the Chinese authorities confirmed today that one of the owners of the company apparently committed suicide.The owner, Zhang Shuhong, apparently killed himself last Saturday by hanging himself in a factory warehouse in the city of Foshan, according to a report in China’s state-controlled media.A spokesman for the Guangdong Public Security Bureau in southern China today confirmed that the police were investigating the apparent suicide.Xiao Bindong, a spokesman for the bureau, said: “It is now confirmed that Mr. Zhang Shuhong committed suicide on the afternoon of August 11.”China, however, insists the vast majority of its exports are safe and of high quality. Many international toy industry officials also say that while the recalls are serious, the problem with defective toys made in China is being grossly exaggerated.“There are something like 30,000 different toy products on sale at any one time,” says Ian J. Anderson, the Asia Pacific director at SGS, a consumer testing company that works with Mattel and other toy makers in China. “How many items have been recalled lately? Anyone can have something go awry. It’s difficult to stay on top of everything.”But United States congressmen and consumer product safety officials from the European Union have expressed growing concern in recent months over the number of defective and tainted products coming from China, which makes most of the world’s toys.Last month, a pair of senators from the United States even proposed new legislation that sought to ban imported children’s products from China unless they were first certified as safe.Responding to such criticism, the Chinese government says it is now stepping up its inspection of toys and other products and that it is cracking down on companies that act illegally.In revoking the export license of Lee Der Industrial, which made the tainted Mattel toys involved in the initial recall, Chinese regulators said they found the company had used a “fake lead-free” paint pigment that came from the company’s paint supplier.At the time of the recall, Mattel officials said the Lee Der facility had testing equipment on site that should have detected lead paint, and that the company had been a reliable supplier for at least 15 years.Mattel has not yet explained what went wrong. But Monday, the company issued a brief statement saying the company was saddened to hear about the death of the Lee Der official.The recalls, however, underscore the problems facing toy makers and other companies doing business in China. China has become a manufacturing powerhouse by depending on cheap labor and savvy cost cutting measures.But sometimes, under pressure to cut costs or win contracts, Chinese manufacturers have cut corners, experts in China say, and chosen to use cheap and illegal substitutes.In June, for instance, another major toy company, the RC2 Corporation of Illinois, recalled 1.5 million popular Thomas & Friends wooden toy railway sets because for at least two years they were being coated with excessive levels of lead paint, even though the manufacturers were aware of restrictions on lead paint, RC2 officials later said.In case after case involving Chinese-made products that were recalled this year, there has been evidence that many Chinese manufacturers intentionally added cheap or illegal substances to save money.While lead paint has long been restricted from being used in toys made for sale in the United States, Europe and even China, it remains much cheaper than lead-free paint. Companies in China say lead paint is sometimes preferred because it offers richer colors, is easier to apply and easier to dry. And so some companies continued to blend it into paint supplies, according to toy consultants.High levels of lead have also been found in Chinese made jewelry and trinkets, posing serious health hazards, according to American officials.'"
"'07-08-14,'0','A challenge to the Nasdaq Stock Market’s bid for the OMX exchange of Sweden appeared to be developing as representatives of the Borse Dubai stock exchange, which bought a stake in the OMX last week, were in Stockholm to meet with OMX officials.

"'07-08-14,'0','But as budgets for movies balloon and the Internet whittles away at box-office returns, the agencies have come under attack and are operating on tighter budgets. I.C.M. in particular, which sold a majority stake to Merrill Lynch and a Connecticut-based private equity group last year, is trying to control expenses.The agency tried in recent months to move Mr. Limato away from daily management and into an emeritus-type position, something that would have stripped him of certain perks, like multiple assistants, but would have allowed him to keep direct involvement with his clients. The move would also have consolidated the power of Mr. Limato’s co-president, Chris Silbermann, 39.Mr. Limato refused, according to both sides.So I.C.M., which last year paid $70 million to acquire Mr. Silbermann’s television agency, the Broder Webb Chervin Silbermann Agency, decided in July to demote Mr. Limato, couching the decision in a news release as “a restructuring of I.C.M.’s motion picture department to deliver long-term growth.” The decision to trumpet the move — agencies are notoriously tight-lipped — stunned the industry.The legal spat turned on a California statute that dates to the era of Hollywood’s star system, a time when studios controlled actors under long-term contracts. Boiled down, the 1931 law says that a personal services contract may not be enforced beyond seven years. The actress Olivia de Havilland used the seven-year rule in 1944 to void her contract with Warner Brothers.I.C.M. lawyers argued that they were seeking to enforce a new contract that Mr. Limato signed last year. Mr. Limato’s position is that a series of contracts without any break is the same thing as one long contract. Since he worked continuously at I.C.M. since 1988, parts of his contract were void under the seven-year rule, Mr. Limato’s lawyers argued.The agency has much at stake. Although a powerhouse in television, I.C.M. is struggling to maintain a toehold on the movie side. As more powerful rivals lured clients like Julia Roberts over the years, I.C.M. failed to attract replacements of similar caliber.I.C.M. is hopeful that at least some of Mr. Limato’s clients will stay behind. Although none have given hints of their plans, most have worked with Mr. Limato for the bulk of their careers and are expected to remain loyal to him.Losing Mr. Limato’s clients could lead to the defection of other I.C.M. agents and actors and — because stars like to be around stars — would probably make it harder for the agency to rebuild its motion picture department.The battle at I.C.M. has been unusually divisive in Hollywood, with factions lining up on both sides and blogs like Deadline Hollywood Daily chronicling the twists and turns in minute detail. In one corner are traditionalists who cite the industry’s habit of treating its atavistic executives with high respect, whether deserved or not. Others see a twist on “Sunset Boulevard,” in which a star agent cannot let go.Generational shifts at Hollywood’s talent agencies are typically rancorous. In 2004, William Morris endured agent defections and firings after a rift on the board over the company’s direction. Creative Artists Agency, now Hollywood’s most pre-eminent talent representative, weathered a similar storm in 1995, when three of the agency’s founding partners left.'"
"'07-08-14,'0','Google and Microsoft recognize the obstacles, and they concede that changing health care will take time. But the companies see the potential in attracting a large audience for health-related advertising and services. And both companies bring formidable advantages to the consumer market for such technology.Microsoft’s software animates more than 90 percent of all personal computers, while Google is the default starting point for most health searches. And people are increasingly turning to their computers and the Web for health information and advice. A Harris poll, published last month, found that 52 percent of adults sometimes or frequently go to the Web for health information, up from 29 percent in 2001.If the efforts of the two big companies gain momentum over time, that promises to accelerate a shift in power to consumers in health care, just as Internet technology has done in other industries.Today, about 20 percent of the nation’s patient population have computerized records — rather than paper ones — and the Bush administration has pushed the health care industry to speed up the switch to electronic formats. But these records still tend to be controlled by doctors, hospitals or insurers. A patient moves to another state, for example, but the record usually stays.The Google and Microsoft initiatives would give much more control to individuals, a trend many health experts see as inevitable. “Patients will ultimately be the stewards of their own information,” said John D. Halamka, a doctor and the chief information officer of the Harvard Medical School.Already the Web is allowing people to take a more activist approach to health. According to the Harris survey, 58 percent of people who look online for health information discussed what they found with their doctors in the last year.It is common these days, Dr. Halamka said, for a patient to come in carrying a pile of Web page printouts. “The doctor is becoming a knowledge navigator,” he said. “In the future, health care will be a much more collaborative process between patients and doctors.”Microsoft and Google are hoping this will lead people to seek more control over their own health records, using tools the companies will provide. Neither company will discuss their plans in detail. But Microsoft’s consumer-oriented effort is scheduled to be announced this fall, while Google’s has been delayed and will probably not be introduced until next year, according to people who have been briefed on the companies’ plans.A prototype of Google Health, which the company has shown to health professionals and advisers, makes the consumer focus clear. The welcome page reads, “At Google, we feel patients should be in charge of their health information, and they should be able to grant their health care providers, family members, or whomever they choose, access to this information. Google Health was developed to meet this need.”A presentation of screen images from the prototype — which two people who received it showed to a reporter — then has 17 other Web pages including a “health profile” for medications, conditions and allergies; a personalized “health guide” for suggested treatments, drug interactions and diet and exercise regimens; pages for receiving reminder messages to get prescription refills or visit a doctor; and directories of nearby doctors.Google executives would not comment on the prototype, other than to say the company plans to experiment and see what people want. “We’ll make mistakes and it will be a long-range march,” said Adam Bosworth, a vice president of engineering and leader of the health team. “But it’s also true that some of what we’re doing is expensive, and for Google it’s not.”At Microsoft, the long-term goal is similarly ambitious. “It will take grand scale to solve these problems like the data storage, software and networking needed to handle vast amounts of personal health and medical information,” said Steve Shihadeh, general manager of Microsoft’s health solutions group. “So there are not many companies that can do this.”This year, Microsoft bought a start-up, Medstory, whose search software is tailored for health information, and last year bought a company that makes software for retrieving and displaying patient information in hospitals. Microsoft software is already used in hospitals, clinical laboratories and doctors’ offices, and, Mr. Shihadeh noted, the three most popular health record systems in doctors’ offices are built with Microsoft software and programming tools.Microsoft will not disclose its product plans, but according to people working with the company the consumer effort will include online offerings as well as software to find, retrieve and store personal health information on personal computers, cellphones and other kinds of digital devices — perhaps even a wristwatch with wireless Internet links some day.Mr. Shihadeh declined to discuss specifics, but said, “We’re building a broad consumer health platform, and we view this challenge as far bigger than a personal health record, which is just scratching the surface.”Yet personal health records promise to be a thorny challenge for practical and privacy reasons. To be most useful, a consumer-controlled record would include medical and treatment records from doctors, hospitals, insurers and laboratories. Under federal law, people can request and receive their personal health data within 90 days. But the process is complicated, and the replies typically come on paper, as photocopies or faxes.The efficient way would be for that data to be sent over the Internet into a person’s digital health record. But that would require partnerships and trust between health care providers and insurers and the digital record-keepers.Privacy concerns are another big obstacle, as both companies acknowledge. Most likely, they say, trust will build slowly, and the online records will include as much or as little personal information as users are comfortable divulging.A person might start, for example, by typing in age, gender and a condition, like diabetes, as a way to find more personalized health information. If a person creates a personal health record and later has second thoughts, a simple mouse click should erase it. The promise, the companies say, will be complete consumer control.There are plenty of competitors these days in online health records and information from start-ups like Revolution Health, headed by AOL’s founder, Stephen M. Case, and thriving profit-makers led by WebMD.Potential rivals are not underestimating the two technology giants. But the smaller companies have the advantage of being focused entirely on health, and some have been around for years. WebMD, for example, traces its lineage to Healtheon, a fallen star of the dot-com era, founded by the Netscape billionaire Jim Clark.Google and Microsoft are great companies, said Wayne T. Gattinella, WebMD’s chief executive, but “that doesn’t mean they will be expert in a specific area like health.”Specialized health search engines — notably Healthline — are gaining ground and adding partners. AOL recently began using Healthline for searches on its health pages, even though Google is a close partner.Still, 58 percent of people seeking health information online begin with a general search engine, according to a recent Jupiter Research report, and Google dominates the field. “Google is the entry point for most health search, and that is a huge advantage,” said Monique Levy, a Jupiter analyst.Indeed, it is the market reach and deep pockets that Google and Microsoft can bring to consumer health information that intrigues medical experts, and has lured recruits. Dr. Roni Zeiger, a graduate of Stanford’s School of Medicine, a medical informatics researcher and a former primary care doctor, joined Google last year. The 36-year-old, who still sees patients some evenings and weekends at a nearby clinic, said, “At Google, I can use my expertise and knowledge to potentially help millions of people each day.”'"
"'07-08-14,'0','Over the years, mutual funds have become a significant part of most Americans’ retirement or 401(k) plans. So far this year, the market has been kind to most mutual funds. Domestic stock funds, for example, have grown 16 percent since the beginning of the year. But the last month has been rough.Specialty real estate investment funds, which largely own real estate investment trusts, are also taking some of the hardest knocks. Those trusts depend on rental payments to generate dividends, and virtually every fund in the sector has declined. Over all, specialty real estate mutual funds have lost about 6 percent of their value in the last month, Morningstar reported, and about 10 percent since the beginning of the year.“The real estate funds have done so well for the last few years because of the easy credit and the access to easy credit,” said Bradley J. Bower, who heads Patriot Investment Management, which oversees $310 million invested almost exclusively in index funds. “Now there is the perception that it will dry up and that will hurt future real estate growth.”But the drop in performance for real estate funds comes after several years of strong growth. Last year, for example, the compounded return for the sector was 8.31 percent, according to Morningstar, and the three-year return was 17.7 percent.Investors have moved aggressively into the market for mutual funds investing in real estate in the last several years. For example, Cohen & Steers, one of the biggest names in real estate trust mutual funds, had $2.3 billion under management in 2005 and a year later was overseeing $9.2 billion, according to Morningstar.And of the hundreds of funds that Morningstar now lists, at least a third did not exist five years ago. Since 2002, the number of real estate mutual funds has grown to 115, from 77, and the amount managed by such funds has ballooned to $78.3 billion, from $15 billion.Although an investor who bought in five years ago would have seen healthy gains to offset recent declines, those who entered this sector more recently could find themselves hurt by the recent market upheaval.“Investors who came into the market recently aren’t sitting on profits,” said Robert L. Adler, president of AMG Data Services, which tracks the flow of money in and out of mutual funds. “But investors who have been in the market for longer are. So a drop of 6 percent, 8 percent or even 10 percent isn’t all that damaging.”As investors have removed risky investments from their portfolios, high-yield bond funds have suffered.According to AMG, investors have been pulling out of these riskier investments. In the week that ended Wednesday, $439 million flowed out of high-yield bond funds. It was the ninth consecutive week that money has moved out of that sector.Though high-yield bond funds are still up 6.5 percent in the last year, they have lost 2.3 percent of their value in the last month and 3.9 percent in the last three months, according to Morningstar. Since the beginning of June, investors have pulled $3.2 billion from these funds.“People walked out the door,” said Kingman D. Penniman, chief executive of KDP Investment Advisors, a bond research firm. “There was an aversion to risk, and people started taking their money out of the high-yield market. A lot of it had to do with recognizing that we’ve gone from a period of excess demand and too much liquidity to a period of almost no demand.”Underscoring just how anxious the market is, some investors are even pulling money from blue chip corporate bonds. For the first time since last July, investors have yanked assets from investment grade corporate bonds, taking out a total of $494 million in the week that ended Wednesday.So where are mutual fund investors going? In a sign that could bode well for investment once the market settles down, many investors have flocked to safe havens like money market funds. Last week, more than $36.2 billion moved into money market funds, the largest amount since December 2005.In times of financial uncertainty, investors often park their cash in money market accounts, giving up big growth in exchange for investment security.“It provides some type of a cushion for the markets,” Mr. Adler said of money markets. “If the markets do stabilize, that money could be brought back in.”'"
"'07-08-14,'0','The Sears Holdings Corporation, the biggest United States department store company, said yesterday that it planned to buy back $1.5 billion in stock.Sears also said second-quarter profit dropped as much as 42 percent, within analysts’ reduced forecasts, after it cut prices on seasonal clothing.The stock gained $7.45, or 5.6 percent, to $140.55.Sears has already spent $3 billion on stock since 2005. Sales have declined at both the Sears and Kmart stores since the company’s chairman, Edward S. Lampert, combined them in 2005.Mr. Lampert has said Sears may buy other companies and may pursue targets outside the retailing industry.“He hasn’t found anything yet that he wants to buy, so why not invest in his own company?” said Scott Rothbort, president of LakeView Asset Management in Millburn, N.J., which owns Sears shares.Second-quarter net income was $170 million to $185 million, or $1.13 to $1.23 a share, for the three months through Aug. 4. In July, Sears forecast $160 million to $200 million for the period, or $1.06 to $1.32 a share. Analysts had estimated profit of $2.07 a share.'"
"'07-08-14,'0','Late on Sunday, the Executive Force issued a ban on demonstrations and public gatherings except those authorized 48 hours in advance. “This measure aims to preserve security and will guarantee that gunshots will not be fired,” Saber Khalifa, a spokesman for the Executive Force, told Agence France-Presse. “Above all, it will permit us to protect these demonstrations with our patrols.”But the organizers of the rally, who do not recognize the authority of the Executive Force, decided to go ahead. Despite efforts to stop them, about 300 demonstrators reached the Square of the Unknown Soldier in the center of Gaza City.Executive Force members tried to stop news coverage of the protest, confiscating cameras and later entering the offices of Al Arabiya, a satellite television channel, to seize a video camera and a tape. Accounts by local reporters said Executive Force members fired in the air and used batons to disperse the crowd.Saleh Nasser, Gaza leader of the leftist Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine, told the Ramattan news agency, based in Gaza, that the actions of the Executive Force were “unacceptable and unprecedented.”The secular opposition in Gaza, led by Fatah, has been showing signs of an awakening after the initial shock of Hamas’s takeover, which ended a brief factional war.“It seems that after two months, people in Gaza feel obliged to stand up against the decisions of the Executive Force,” said Mkhaimar Abusada, a political scientist at Al Azhar University in Gaza, which is affiliated with Fatah. “The Executive Force has been trying to impose martial law.”He added that there had been an explosion on Monday morning next to the Saraya compound, the main security headquarters in Gaza, which Hamas captured from Fatah.There are plans for a four-way meeting on Wednesday in Jericho between the foreign ministers of Israel, Japan and Jordan and the prime minister of the Palestinian caretaker government, Salam Fayyad.An official at the Japanese Embassy in Tel Aviv told reporters that the Japanese foreign minister, Taro Aso, would announce the resumption of direct aid to the Palestinian Authority during his visit to the region. The aid was suspended in early 2006, when Hamas came to power after winning parliamentary elections.'"
"'07-08-14,'0','RUMBEK, Sudan, Aug. 13 — Human Rights Watch on Monday accused the transitional government in Somalia and the Ethiopian troops that helped bring it to power of war crimes in Somalia, saying that Ethiopian troops had shelled hospitals, that Somali officials had blocked aid convoys and that both forces had shown wanton indifference toward civilians.In a scathing 113-page report on the bloodshed in Somalia, Human Rights Watch also blamed Somali insurgents for summary executions and mutilating bodies.The report found what Somali refugees, United Nations arms monitors and Western diplomats in East Africa had said for months: that Somalia was a human rights nightmare characterized by urban combat, heavy casualties and no foreseeable end.“The warring parties have all shown criminal disregard for the well-being of the civilian population of Mogadishu,” said Kenneth Roth, executive director of Human Rights Watch.Ethiopian and Somali officials denied that their troops had committed any abuses.“Those are very unfounded reports,” said Bereket Simon, special adviser to the Ethiopian prime minister, Meles Zenawi. “We haven’t killed any civilians.”'"
"'07-08-14,'0','Qualcomm, the mobile phone chip maker, announced yesterday that its general counsel had resigned on the eve of a crucial hearing in its patent dispute against a rival, Broadcom.Qualcomm, which has suffered a handful of legal setbacks recently, said that its general counsel, Louis M. Lupin, was taking personal leave and would step down as the lead lawyer, although he would remain with the company in some capacity. The decision to resign was wholly personal and the company did not ask him to leave, Qualcomm said.The company said his duties would be assumed by Carol C. Lam, a former United States attorney in Southern California who joined Qualcomm this year.Qualcomm is facing a number of high-profile legal challenges at home and abroad.Overseas, it continues to face anticompetition complaints from the European Commission and Korea, industry analysts said. In the United States, it is embroiled in litigation and hostile negotiations with a number of companies, including Broadcom and a longtime partner, Nokia.In the multipronged dispute with Broadcom, a federal judge last week admonished Qualcomm’s lawyers for withholding evidence during a trial that concluded in January. Also last week, the Bush administration upheld an earlier ruling that required Qualcomm to pay royalties to use power management technology covered by a patent controlled by Broadcom.'"
"'07-08-14,'0','Some American officials have suggested that insurgents have been using more sophisticated means to shoot down helicopters as the conflict has worn on.Still, those attacks have been clustered around the center of the country, and the events in Sulaimaniya could be the first indication that insurgent efforts to disrupt Western air transport have moved north.The accusation that there had been missile fire was a potential blow to the reputation and economy of the Kurdish region, and Kurdish officials disputed the contention that the plane came under fire.Two Swedish aviation companies have operated regular routes serving Sulaimaniya and Erbil, the international airports in northern Iraq. On Friday, all Swedish flights to the region were suspended indefinitely.Northern Iraq, largely under Kurdish administration since 1991, is Iraq’s safest area and has been spared most of the sectarian violence and terrorist attacks that have plagued regions to the south. It is also geographically isolated. Many of its residents depend on its airports for travel in and out of the region, as do Western civilian contractors and, to a lesser degree, travelers from the United States government.Brig. Sarkawt Hassan Jalal, the director of security in the Sulaimaniya region, said local investigators had found no evidence of a missile shot. “There was not an attack, not even from the bullet of a pistol,” he said by telephone. “No rocket, not a thing. All of this is just propaganda.”While all Swedish flights are forbidden indefinitely, Mr. Lundblad said that the other Swedish carrier, Viking Airlines, wanted to continue its flights and that the aviation authority would examine security this week. “What we will do is see if there is any information that might change this decision,” he said.The Sulaimaniya airport, a former Iraqi military landing strip used in the Iran-Iraq war and later deserted, was reopened by Kurds cooperating with the Central Intelligence Agency and the American Special Forces in early 2003, weeks before of the start of the war.At the time, it was a lone asphalt strip in a field. It has since been developed as an international airport, with a small but modern terminal and routes to Baghdad and several countries, including Jordan and Turkey.'"
"'07-08-14,'0','Floods in southern China have hurt crops. Grain prices have been rising globally because more grain is being used for ethanol production and because increasingly affluent people in developing countries are buying more grain-fed livestock and poultry. Pigs in China have been dying in significant numbers from diseases, driving up pork prices.Prime Minister Wen Jiabao of China visited Beijing’s wholesale food market on Aug. 4 and called for local governments across the country to check on food supply lines from farms and to subsidize poor families to keep food on their tables.“The supply line for daily necessities should not be disrupted,” Mr. Wen said, according to the official Xinhua news agency.The Chinese government is now paying much greater attention to food safety, following scandals like the contaminated pet food that killed cats and dogs in the United States. But experts doubt the increased emphasis on safety is causing inflation.“New food safety rules may have an indirect, long-term effect on food prices, but have little impact on the price increases we are seeing now,” Jing Ulrich, the chairman of China equities at JPMorgan Chase, said in an e-mail statement.Higher food prices may have a silver lining for China’s leaders: when prices reflect greater demand for food, as opposed to flood damage or dying pigs, the price increases mean more income for China’s 800 million peasants. President Hu Jintao has made it a top priority to increase farm incomes and reduce income inequality between rural and urban areas; when Mr. Wen visited the Beijing market in a trip covered by official media, he was careful to avoid criticizing farmers and did not accuse them of price gouging, although he did caution against hoarding and speculation in general.The real mystery is why inflation is largely confined to food. Excluding food, consumer prices were up 0.9 percent last month from a year earlier, about the same increase as in June.Economists are divided, and to some extent perplexed, by how well inflation has been contained in the rest of the economy. Some predict that prices will start rising soon for a broader range of goods and services, warning that the economy may have reached an unsustainable rate of growth when it expanded 11.9 percent in the second quarter.By comparison, growth of 9.6 percent in the second quarter of 2004 ignited a broad acceleration of inflation then. Ships had to wait as long as a month to unload supplies of critical industrial commodities like iron ore for steel production, driving up costs that producers passed on to consumers. Railroads were unable to clear docks of arriving cargoes, which piled up in enormous mounds at docks.National, provincial and local government agencies have engaged in a frenzy of spending since then on new ports, railroads, highways, pipelines and other infrastructure while businesses have been investing heavily in new factories, office buildings, apartment towers and more. Economists contend that the sheer scale of the spending has sometimes been wasteful and that unnecessary projects have been completed.But China has avoided so far the inflationary bottlenecks that briefly threatened to overwhelm it in 2004, even as growth has accelerated to a considerably faster pace.Some economists worry that broader inflation will still come to China. They point to a brisk expansion in the money supply last month, and suggest that soon too much money may be chasing too few goods, inevitably leading to broader rises in China’s consumer price index.“In our view, inflationary pressures will remain high in the coming months, and we see significant upside risks to our current C.P.I. forecasts,” Liang Hong, an economist in the Hong Kong offices of Goldman Sachs, wrote in a research note.So far, stock investors are largely untroubled by the inflation figures released today. The Shanghai market in A shares climbed 1.52 percent while the Shenzhen A share market fell 0.89 percent.'"
"'07-08-14,'0','NEOSHO, Mo., Aug. 13 (AP) — Prosecutors filed three murder charges Monday against a Micronesian man accused of opening fire inside a church here Sunday afternoon, killing three people and wounding five others during services for a mostly Micronesian congregation.At a news conference, the police and prosecutors declined to discuss the motive. But those killed were identified as the pastor and two church elders, and the Newton County prosecuting attorney, Scott Watson, told The Associated Press earlier Monday that the gunman had gone after leaders of the congregation.“As information continues to come forward,” Mr. Watson said, “it appears that the shots that were fired were not random.”A plea of not guilty was entered for the defendant, Eiken Elam Saimon, 52, at a brief arraignment in this county seat in far southwestern Missouri, near the state lines of Arkansas, Oklahoma and Kansas. The judge set bail at $1 million and scheduled a preliminary hearing for Sept. 18.The five people Mr. Saimon is accused of wounding are expected to recover, said the Neosho police chief, David McCracken. In addition to the three counts of murder, Mr. Saimon is charged with assault, felonious restraint on the ground of briefly holding the congregation hostage after the shooting, and armed criminal action.Further, Mr. Saimon is a suspect in the sexual assault of a 14-year-old girl on Saturday, Mr. Watson said. That girl is a relative of Mr. Saimon, although the authorities did not specify how they were related.'"
"'07-08-14,'0','NEW DELHI, Aug. 13 — Simmering distrust of the United States broke into full-throated protest on Monday in the Indian Parliament, as politicians from the right and left pounced on the government for its landmark nuclear accord with Washington, heckling the prime minister before he could defend it.The accord, known as the 123 agreement and announced last month, has been regarded as the cornerstone of deepening relations between the world’s largest and oldest democracies. It would allow India to buy nuclear fuel and technology on the world market for its civilian nuclear power plants. The “123” refers to a section of the United States Atomic Energy Act.India would retain the right to reprocess atomic fuel and to continue to test its nuclear weapons — two items on which New Delhi bargained hard. In exchange, India has agreed to separate its reactors for civilian use, to open them up to inspections and to build a new facility, under international safeguards, for reprocessing.Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has defended the deal as good for India’s strategic and economic interests. But as he approached the podium in the lower house of Parliament on Monday afternoon to give his first address since the deal was signed, members of Parliament broke out in howls of protest and pumped their fists. The outburst was perhaps more remarkable for its spectacle than its substance.The speaker of the house, Somnath Chatterjee, appealed for order. “The country’s prime minister cannot speak,” he ventured. It was in vain.'"
"'07-08-14,'0','LONDON, Aug. 13 — Akzo Nobel, the world’s largest maker of paints and coatings, said Monday that it had agreed to buy Imperial Chemical Industries for £8 billion, or $16 billion, after raising its offer twice in two months.Akzo, which supplies the coating for Airbus’s A380 planes, will offer Imperial Chemical investors £6.70 in cash for each of their shares. The price is 22 percent more than the chemical company’s share price on the day Akzo made its first offer of £6 a share, which was rejected as too low.Akzo has yet to gain shareholder approval for the bid, and some investors have said that shareholders may see the price as too high at a time when financial markets could face another downturn. TPG-Axon, an American investment firm that holds a 3.5 percent stake in Akzo, said earlier that it was concerned about the offer.Yet others have said that Akzo has to buy Imperial Chemical to make use of the $14.4 billion it received for selling its drugs unit, Organon, to Schering-Plough, the American drug maker, in March, or risk becoming a takeover target itself.“Shareholders will clearly have to accept that the company needs to do an acquisition,” said Wim Hoste, an analyst at KBC Securities in Brussels. “I.C.I. is a good strategic fit even at a higher price.”Akzo, based in Arnhem, the Netherlands, said Monday that it expected to generate 280 million euros, or $382 million, in savings from the takeover. To make the transaction more attractive to shareholders, Akzo may add 3 billion euros to an existing share buyback program worth about 1.6 billion euros. Akzo plans to sell Imperial Chemical’s American National Starch unit to the German consumer chemicals supplier Henkel for £2.7 billion.'"
"'07-08-14,'0','Researchers studying 313 healthy Vietnam veterans have found that anger and hostility may increase the risk for cardiovascular disease, diabetes and high blood pressure.Over a period of 10 years, the men had regular physical examinations involving a wide variety of medical tests. They also underwent psychological examinations using well-established questionnaires to determine their levels of hostility, anger and depression.The researchers measured blood levels of a protein called C3, a marker for the inflammation that is a risk factor for cardiovascular illnesses. After controlling for other variables, the scientists found that those in the highest one-quarter in hostility, anger and depression showed a steady and significant increase in C3 levels, while those in the lowest one-quarter had no increase.“This may put those men at increased risk for hypertension, diabetes and coronary heart disease,” said Stephen H. Boyle, the lead author of the study and a researcher at Duke University Medical Center.Why these increases in C3 levels happen is unknown, but the authors speculate that anger in hostile and depressed men initiates a series of chemical responses in the immune system that lead to inflammation.Taking steps to control hostility may be helpful. “There are interventions that appear to be useful in lowering levels of anger,” Dr. Boyle said. “I don’t know if their long-term effects on physiology have been tested, but if you’re less angry and hostile, that in itself is a worthy goal.”'"

"'07-08-15,'0','In Asia, shares in Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group and Sumitomo Mitsui Financial fell to their lowest in two years after the two banks reported losing several billion yen due to the declines in the United States subprime market.Mitsubishi UFJ said it has unrealized losses of about 5 billion yen ($42.6 million). Sumitomo Mitsui said it had sold about 350 billion yen in American mortgage-backed securities, suffering losses of several billions of yen as a result.Perhaps the biggest trigger to today’s slide in Asia was news that the American retail chains Wal-Mart Stores and Home Depot had reported disappointing earnings for the second quarter and predicted an even bumpier year ahead because of higher energy costs and a sagging housing market.That news sent the Dow Jones Industrial average down more than 200 points on Tuesday, and the decline resonated throughout Asia, stoking investor concerns that the housing slump in the United States could hurt American consumer demand for Asian exports.Economists disagree over the extent to which Asia is still dependent on American export demand, though most concur that a significant decline in American retail spending would hurt Asia.In Hong Kong, shares of exporters such as Li & Fung dropped along with the Hang Seng China Enterprises Index, which tracks 41 mainland companies.Declines in Tokyo were exacerbated by many domestic investors being away for Japan’s traditional mid-August Buddhist holidays, according to Ed Merner, who manages the Atlantis Japan Growth Fund in Tokyo. Those investors have been steadily buying Japanese shares recently. “A lot of people are panicking,” said Mr. Merner.What concerns many investors in Asia now is not the direct exposure that institutions may have to the United States subprime market, but rather their overall exposure to credit derivatives such as collateralized debt obligations that have become less valuable as subprime concerns send interest rates higher.As a percentage of their overall assets, the losses reported by banks in Asia so far have been tiny. Analysts say the fallout is widening, however, as the implosion of credit emanating from the United States reverberates through credit markets worldwide.Even for banks and other institutions with little or no subprime exposure, the United States subprime problem is forcing up short-term interest rates.This is particularly harmful to lenders borrowing short-term to make long-term loans, which is what happened to Australia mortgage lender Rams Home Loans Group, according to Ben Zucker, an analyst at Macquarie Bank in Sydney.Rams said on Tuesday that the situation in American markets was forcing it to pay more to cover its financing, potentially hurting earnings. Rams doesn’t invest in American mortgage loans or lend money to American homeowners, but it had been taking out loans of less than a year in order to lend out mortgages that can run for as long as 25 years, Mr. Zucker said.'"
"'07-08-15,'0','China’s retail sales grew at the fastest rate in more than three years, helped by a stock market rally and higher wages and prices. Spending climbed 16.4 percent, to 699.8 billion yuan ($92 billion) in July from a year earlier, after gaining 16 percent in June, the National Bureau of Statistics said. The figures are not adjusted for inflation. The biggest increase in consumer prices in a decade contributed to the acceleration. Stock market gains and a 14 percent jump in urban incomes underpinned demand. “Inflation played an important role in gains for food sales,” said Paul Tang, chief economist at Bank of East Asia in Hong Kong. “But in other categories, there’s genuine continued gains, and overall growth is steady.”'"
"'07-08-15,'0','Mr. Romney said later in an interview on “Fox News Sunday” that he had not meant to equate military service with his sons’ campaign work. To be fair, that part of his response came only after an extended series of comments in which he explained that the military was a “volunteer army” and that his sons had made different career choices.Some have questioned the fairness of impugning Mr. Romney for his sons’ choices. It is also unclear why Mr. Romney’s children have drawn scrutiny and not those of others, like Rudolph W. Giuliani, who has a son at Duke University.“Is it a fair question?” said Stewart Peay, the husband of Mr. Romney’s niece, who went to Iraq with the Utah National Guard. “In the world of the all-volunteer army, I don’t know if it is or not.”But Mr. Peay said that while in Iraq he had wrestled with what difference it might have made if President Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney had family members in harm’s way.“I think it’s unfortunate sometimes that we don’t have a broader group of people in the military,” he said, “but that’s a result of an all-volunteer military.”There was a time when military service was much more common for family members of those in public life. President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s four sons all fought in World War II. All four sons of Joseph P. Kennedy served in the military, including his eldest, Joseph Jr., who was killed in World War II, and his second son, John F. Kennedy, who was wounded and later went on to become president.Politicians should try to envision whether they believe in a war enough that they would send their own children, said Nancy Lessin, co-founder of Military Families Speak Out, an antiwar group made up of more than 3,600 military families.“If this war is so important, why is it O.K. for you to support our loved ones fighting it but not send your own sons?” said Ms. Lessin, whose stepson joined the Marines after college and went to Iraq.The fact that Mr. Romney’s sons have not served is not necessarily surprising, she said, because the military tends to be dominated by those from less well-to-do backgrounds.“There is the economic, or the opportunity, draft,” Ms. Lessin said.Of others seeking the presidency, Representative Duncan Hunter, Republican of California, talks often on the stump about his son, Duncan Jr., who served two tours in Iraq with the Marines and is on his third in Afghanistan.“I think it’s valuable to have a commander in chief who can look the American people in the eye and say, ‘We’re all in this together,’ ” said Mr. Hunter, who is a Vietnam veteran.Senator John McCain, a former prisoner of war in Vietnam, by contrast, goes out of his way to avoid talking publicly about his son Jimmy, a marine who was recently deployed to Iraq. Mr. McCain has another son, Jack, who is at the United States Naval Academy.Shortly before leaving for Iraq, Jimmy McCain spent a few days last month on the campaign trail in New Hampshire with his father. He stayed in the background at events, even when Mr. McCain gave a big speech laying out his reasons for continuing to support the current strategy in Iraq.The one time Jimmy McCain’s name came up was at the last stop of the trip. There, at American Legion Post 29 in Claremont, N.H., one of the veterans who gathered for a public forum drew a big round of applause for praising Jimmy McCain’s service.Apparently unbeknown to the questioner, Mr. McCain’s son was sitting just a few seats away. But Mr. McCain did not introduce him to the crowd.Fair or not, it is likely that the issue will continue to dog Mr. Romney. He got the question again later in the week at the Iowa State Fair, this time from a man holding a photograph of his son in a soldier’s uniform.“None of your sons are in the military?” the man asked.Mr. Romney said they were not.“Are they going to go over to Iraq?” the man asked.“No, they are not,” Mr. Romney said.“Who is going to do his job?” the man said.“We have a volunteer army,” Mr. Romney said. “That’s the reason.”'"
"'07-08-15,'0','MINNEAPOLIS, Aug. 14 (AP) — The hedge fund manager William A. Ackman dropped his opposition to the sale of the Ceridian Corporation, the payroll processor, after tangling with the company for months.Mr. Ackman, who controls 14.9 percent of Ceridian through his Pershing Square Capital Management and related funds, has insisted Ceridian is worth more than the $36-a-share sale price that the company’s managers have accepted. He has said Ceridian should hold out for more money or consider spinning off its profitable Comdata unit, a processor of credit and gift card transactions.With the recent squeeze on credit markets, however, the $36 offer suddenly looks good to Mr. Ackman, according to a filing made on Tuesday.“Significant deterioration in the credit and broader markets has made other alternatives less viable and $36 per share more attractive,” Mr. Ackman wrote. “As a result, we fully accept the company’s recommendation for the merger and intend to vote our shares in favor of it.”Ceridian, based in Minneapolis, agreed to a $5.3 billion buyout offer from Thomas H. Lee Partners and an insurer, Fidelity National Financial. Shareholders are set to vote on the buyout at Ceridian’s annual meeting on Sept. 12.Mr. Ackman said he would still run his own slate of directors, in case the deal did not close.In that case, he wrote, Pershing Square will still own more than $700 million worth of the company and it will need a board “which is well equipped and incentivized to oversee the business going forward.”'"
"'07-08-15,'0','The trade deficit report caused many economists to raise their economic forecasts for this year. Some revised their estimates for growth in the second quarter, which the government reported at 3.4 percent, to more than 4 percent.Still, trade can support growth only so much. If American consumers start to reduce their spending, economists said, a downturn becomes much more likely. Those fears spread yesterday on Wall Street, where stocks declined sharply after Wal-Mart and Home Depot warned of slowing sales.The trade deficit report said that the gap between what Americans import and export was $58.1 billion in June, seasonally adjusted, compared with $59.2 billion in May.While the trade imbalance is still huge, the June numbers showed that the overall pattern of trade was becoming less uneven as imports grew at a slower rate ($192.7 billion in June versus $191.7 billion in May) and exports climbed ($134.5 billion versus $132.6 billion). The government also said the trade deficit in May was actually about $1 billion smaller than was first reported last month.From January through June, exports rose 11 percent compared with the period a year earlier, as companies overseas purchased tens of billions of dollars worth of goods like industrial machinery, metals, chemicals and semiconductors.As the declining housing market holds the economy back at least until the end of the year, economists expect trade to pick up some of the slack. “It’s a pressure release,” said Stephen Stanley, chief economist for RBS Greenwich Capital. “It’s one place where we’re going to make up for the weakness we’ve seen in the housing sector.”But the trade report revealed some soft spots in the American economy. Imports of consumer goods fell 2 percent in June, a potential sign of slowing consumer demand. “That’s lower domestic demand growth, and that’s not encouraging as far as the Fed is concerned,” said Paul Ashworth, senior United States economist for Capital Economics.The Labor Department said yesterday that the Producer Price Index — the government’s calculation of the prices businesses charge one another — rose 0.6 percent in July after dropping 0.2 percent in June. A separate measure of prices that excludes food and energy prices, which are subject to large and volatile swings, registered a more benign 0.1 percent increase last month. It rose 0.3 percent in June.The producer price numbers were in line with the big-picture trend of inflation in recent months and suggested that while price increases on the whole are getting more modest, they are still prone to bouncing around unpredictably. Over all, producer prices rose 4 percent from July 2006 to July 2007, the Labor Department said, and 2.3 percent excluding food and energy.The cost of gasoline was up 3.2 percent last month after falling 3.9 percent the month before. Other energy prices also edged up. The cost of electricity rose 1.8 percent, and the cost of natural gas for heating was up 2.7 percent.When the Fed voted last week to leave its benchmark short-term interest rate unchanged, it said that above all else, it was concerned that inflation would not ease in the months ahead. The Fed’s statement acknowledged the recent losses in the stock market and said that the risk of an economic downturn had increased somewhat. But it nevertheless indicated that central bankers would consider lowering interest rates only if the economic outlook worsened further in the weeks and months ahead.“The Fed is not going to ease just in response to the financial market turmoil,” said Mickey D. Levy, chief economist with Bank of America. Because it is unclear whether the markets’ troubles are the beginning of a larger economic problem, it is impossible to predict what the Fed might do a month from now, Mr. Levy added. “Let’s just stay tuned.”'"
"'07-08-15,'0','Five of Wall Street’s biggest banks, including Citigroup, Lehman Brothers and Merrill Lynch, said yesterday that they were setting up a system to trade privately placed stocks.The group, which also includes the underwriter Morgan Stanley and Bank of New York Mellon, said the system would start operating in September. It will serve companies looking to raise capital without the scrutiny given to publicly listed companies.The platform, the Open Platform for Unregistered Securities, or Opus-5, would be an alternative to those introduced by Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase.Bear Stearns announced yesterday that it had started a similar platform, Best Markets.These platforms are open only to big money managers already dealing in private stock and debt transactions.Today, Nasdaq Stock Market is to introduce its own platform for private securities, Portal, which could supersede the bank-run systems.'"
"'07-08-15,'0','Mr. Skulnik says that with its agreement, the U Street consortium is buying nearly two million kilowatt-hours of renewable energy a year. He maintains that in terms of the carbon dioxide replaced, this use of alternative energy will have the same impact as taking 185 motor vehicles off the road for a year.The deal that the U Street businesses made was with Washington Gas Energy Services Inc., an alternative supplier in the Washington area, which buys energy from wind farms in West Virginia, Pennsylvania and other mid-Atlantic states. The owners of the utility lines in the area, Pepco, the main electricity company in the Washington area, will guarantee the service, and the businesses will continue to be billed through Pepco.Despite their name, the “wind certificates” that the U Street merchants bought do not guarantee that their power comes from wind farms that generate electricity. The more formal name is “renewable energy certificates,” or RECs, and they cover a combination of renewable energy sources including wind, solar and geothermal power.Through the certificates, Washington Gas Energy Services will get credit for the amount of electricity it buys that does not come from plants that burn coal, oil or natural gas under a new District of Columbia law requiring utilities to increase their use of renewable energy.There is growing evidence, scientists and environmental advocates say, that the carbon dioxide emitted in the production of electricity by fossil-fuel power plants has contributed to global warming.Along with Ben’s Chili Bowl, the other businesses in the wind power consortium are Boundless Yoga, CakeLove, Love Cafe, Rumberos restaurant, Coppi’s Organic restaurant, Busboys & Poets, the Luna Grill and Diner, the Diner and Tryst, which is a coffee house and restaurant. Their transition from conventional power to wind has been seamless and required no equipment or changes in the way they do business.With their three-year agreement, the businesses expect to save a total of about $21,000 annually, or an average of about 9 percent each. Mr. Skulnik’s company earns a 1 percent commission on the total electric bills; the commission is paid by the power provider.The more energy a business uses, the greater the potential savings. Busboys & Poets, for example, a 4,000-square-foot restaurant that serves up jazz and free Wi-Fi from 8 a.m. until midnight, will probably save more than CakeLove, a bakery that operates in a little less than 1,000 square feet of space.Kim Weeks, the owner of Boundless Yoga, is the only member of the group who will pay higher electric bills because of her participation.“In my industry, it is important that we be a leader in sustainability of the environment,” said Ms. Weeks, whose yoga studio occupies about 2,000 square feet on two levels. “We need to show our customers that we are doing what we can to choose to go green, even if it’s more expensive.” Ms. Weeks also said that compared with rent and other expenses, the cost of electricity is marginal for her.Businesses like Boundless Yoga represent the new face of U Street. Known before World War II as Washington’s Black Broadway, the street was an entertainment and shopping area, where artists like Duke Ellington and Ella Fitzgerald performed. U Street started to lose its luster in the 1960s, and its decline was hastened by rioting there after the assassination of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Some businesses that remained struggled until the late 1990s, when new residential development led to a turnaround.Now some of the businesses that helped to spark the revival of the strip are feeling the pressure of its success. Most of them are tenants, not owners of their spaces. As the neighborhood property values have risen, so have some rents.Last year, the Latino Economic Development Corporation formed a coalition of small independent businesses, including all of those on U Street that are using wind power, to help them handle the pressures of rising costs.Since then, Ayari de la Rosa, business program manager of the nonprofit group, has negotiated group rates for insurance, advertising and marketing for alliance members.Ms. de la Rosa was the matchmaker between the U Street businesses and Clean Currents. “In this city, it is getting harder and harder for small businesses to stay in areas like U Street,” she said.Ms. de la Rosa met Mr. Skulnik when she was searching for additional ways for the alliance members to share costs. “We started working on ways for these businesses to save money by combining economically and environmentally sustainable business practices,” she said.Mr. Skulnik said he expected his company, based in Rockville, Md., to complete a wind power deal soon for a second group of small businesses in Washington.He believes the demand for green energy from businesses of all sizes and types can only grow as jurisdictions demand that power companies provide alternatives to fossil-fuel energy.The District of Columbia and 23 states have mandates or stated goals that push utilities toward renewable energy. Last year, voters in Washington approved a renewable energy standard for the city requiring that electric power providers gradually increase the amount of renewable energy they generate. The new law says the percentage must be 11 percent by 2022.“People are beginning to make the connection between our dependence on fossil fuel and the cost of energy and global warming,” said Mr. Skulnik, who started Clean Currents after working for nearly a decade in the nonprofit world as an advocate for the environment. “They are also learning that they do have a choice as to who provides their electric power and the sources of that power.”'"
"'07-08-15,'0','Still, the bank has left itself an out. This month when Mr. Trichet first hinted at a September rate increase, he emphasized more than usual that the central bank would not “precommit” itself to a rate increase — least of all during uncertain times.“It still depends on whether we return to stability in the markets,” Kenneth Wattret, chief euro-zone economist at BNP Paribas in London, said of the possibility of a September rate increase. “If we go back to a period of turmoil, it’s hard to believe they would raise.”The European bank has lifted borrowing costs nine times since the end of 2005, to 4.25 percent. Higher interest rates have helped bolster the value of the euro, causing concern among politicians, mainly in France, that the central bank might be quashing a recovery.Yet if the European bank abandons plans for lifting rates in September, it could fan concerns that it is privy to bad news not yet made public.“If the bank now delays its rate increase,” said Kenneth Broux, an economist at Lloyds TSB in London, “it will create suspicions it knows something that the markets do not.”Data released Tuesday showed that the pace of economic growth in the 13-nation euro zone slowed in the second quarter to 0.3 percent, about half the rate of the first quarter. France and Germany, the two largest euro members, registered 0.3 percent growth in the same period, less than economists had forecast, but in line with the central bank’s prognosis of steady growth that would allow it to raise its benchmark rate by a quarter-point.Despite the slowing, Axel A. Weber, the president of the German Bundesbank, said that losses related to the collapse of the American subprime mortgage sector would be limited.IKB Deutsche Industriebank, a small German bank, sent shudders through markets recently when a default gave rise to a government-engineered rescue. But Mr. Weber said other German financial institutions were sound.“We have confirmed our impression that the increased risks in certain market segments are insulated and that the profit impact for credit institutions is limited over all,” Mr. Weber said. The recent problems at IKB are a one-time case, he said, specific to that institution.Taken together, the statements by the Bundesbank and the central bank appeared to be a broad offensive aimed at closing the door on short-term concerns and easing the way for stability.The European bank injected 7.7 billion euros ($10.4 billion) in one-day liquidity into the system Tuesday, a far smaller amount than the 94.8 billion euros it provided Thursday.Mr. Weber’s statement was aimed at assuring markets that no more surprises along the lines of IKB were in the offing, since markets feared German lenders might be hiding greater losses.'"
"'07-08-15,'0','Marketers largely ignore the badminton ringers. And they couldn’t name an archer outside of Robin Hood (who was an advocate for the poor but never medaled).It will be the prime-time podium — reserved for track stars and swim kings and Dream Teamers — that will illuminate those Olympians with a cause, and, maybe more importantly, those without one.Who dares to arrive in Beijing without a political statement? For some athletes, it will be a personal choice. To light a candle for cultural awareness is out of their character. For others, it will be a business decision. To humiliate China with a stance is to upset their corporate partners.As a new member of McDonald’s Olympic ad campaign, might the swimmer Michael Phelps think twice before McChallenging China’s dubious record on food safety?As a Nike pitchman in a Swoosh-factory part of the world, as a Coca-Cola endorser twinned with China’s Yao Ming, will LeBron James risk his global expansion plans to question the nation’s labor issues?“I think you take a guy like LeBron James,” Potts said. “He’s very cognizant of what he sells himself as and whether or not he puts himself out there politically.”James has already declined to sign a petition protesting China’s link to Darfur this spring because, as he recently told Time magazine, he was still educating himself on the issue. (Hint: Google “genocide.”)He knows Wall Street, though. James once told The Akron Beacon-Journal: “I tell my friends and teammates that you have to go global. In basketball and business.”James’s platinum-level ambitions, including his goal to be the world’s richest athlete, fly in contrast to his selflessness as a player.James is extremely self-aware, increasingly sensitive about how his money-bags tone has been received in recent months.Maybe that’s why he bristled when asked about his branding strategy for China during a recent interview in Las Vegas, where he was practicing with the United States team for its coming basketball qualifying tournament.“I’m not waking up saying, Let’s build a brand in China,” James said.But it is all but written in his business planner. And in Mandarin, no less. In preparation for Beijing, James has been taking Mandarin lessons, which were understandably knocked down the priority list during the Cleveland Cavaliers’ playoff run.“My N.B.A. season went a little further than I thought it would, so I’m a little rusty,” he said.There is enlightenment in his effort. He is reaching out, not just reaching into China’s vast cookie jar of consumers. But like a lot of the American corporations he represents, James is into Beijing 2008 for economic growth, not political debate.That’s his option. In the coming months, at every Beijing qualifying event, athletes will be making decisions on which cause, if any, they’ll support.“I think there is an opportunity and a platform to talk about and bring about awareness to social issues, but it’s a personal choice to tackle it,” Potts said. “Hopefully, it remains a personal choice because you’d hate to have it scripted out for you. When it’s scripted, it’s just not genuine. I think people can see through that.”Wearing a rubber bracelet will not automatically authenticate a star as an advocate. And preferring to sidestep politics will not diminish an Olympian. It’s the motive behind the resolve that matters.'"

"'07-08-16,'0','The new iMovie, for example, is probably the only video-editing program on the market with no timeline—no horizontal, scrolling strip that displays your clips laid end to end, with their lengths representing their durations. You have no indication of how many minutes into your movie you are.The new iMovie gets a D for audio editing. You can choose one piece of music to put behind the video, but that's it. You can't manually adjust audio levels during a scene (for example, to make the music quieter when someone is speaking). You can't extract the audio from a clip. The program creates a fade-out at the end of an audio clip, but you can't control its length or curve.All the old audio effects are gone, too. No pitch changing, high-pass and low-pass filters, or reverb.The new iMovie doesn't accept plug-ins, either. For years, I've relied on GeeThree.com's iMovie plug-ins to achieve effects like picture-in-picture, bluescreen and subtitles. That's all over now.You can't add chapter markers for use in iDVD, which is supposed to be integrated with iMovie. Bookmarks are gone. ""Themes"" are gone. You can no longer export only part of a movie.All visual effects are gone—even basic options like slow motion, reverse motion, fast motion, and black-and-white. And you can't have more than one project open at a time.Incredibly, the new iMovie can't even convert older iMovie projects. All you can import is the clips themselves. None of your transitions, titles, credits, music, or special effects are preserved.On top of all that, this more limited iMovie has steep horsepower requirements that rule out most computers older than about two years old.To be sure, the new version has some cool features. You can send a completed video to YouTube with one menu command; the color-correction and frame-cropping tools are unprecedented in a consumer program; and you can really, truly delete unwanted pieces of your clips, thus reclaiming hard drive space. (iMovie and Final Cut, on the other hand, preserve an entire 20-minute clip on your hard drive even if you've used only 3 seconds of it.)It's also worth pointing out that iMovie '08 creates titles, crossfades and color adjustments instantly. There's no ""rendering"" time, as there is in Final Cut or the old iMovie. So you gain an exhilarating freedom to play, to fiddle with the timing and placement of things.But honestly. To rephrase (and sanitize) the wailing on the discussion boards: What the [bleep]! What was Apple thinking?Apple says that it was thinking: ""It's 1.0. We'll bring it up to par with free software updates, like we always do."" Internally, I'm guessing that it was also thinking, ""iMovie had gotten pretty old, and it was haunted by some intractable bugs."" And also, perhaps, ""iMovie was getting so powerful, it was taking sales away from Final Cut.""But it must also have been thinking, ""Then again, it is a little embarrassing to take so many steps backward.""That's why, with what I imagine is a certain degree of sheepishness, the company is offering a free download of the previous iMovie version to anyone who has iMovie '08. In that regard, all the wailing is a bit overblown; Apple is not actually taking away the older version. The only real raw part of the deal is that people who pay $80 for a new software rev expect an enhanced version—not another copy of the old one.I can't remember any software company pulling a stunt like this before: throwing away a fully developed, mature, popular program and substituting a bare-bones, differently focused program under the same name.I've used the real iMovie to edit my Times videos for three years now. The results are perfectly convincing as professional video blog work. But the new version is totally unusable for that purpose. It's unusable, in fact, for anyone doing professional work that requires any degree of precision.I can't help thinking that Apple would have done better to call a spade a spade, and give the new program a different name. Call it FlyMovie, or ByeMovie, or WhyMovie.But one thing's for sure: it sure isn't iMovie.'"

Microsoft Works is the consumer-oriented software for word-processing and spreadsheets, and it’s much less expensive than Microsoft’s Office suite marketed to professionals. But the cheaper stuff has limits.With a little tinkering, Works programs can open Excel spreadsheets and Word files. The trick is to open them within Works by going to the File menu, choosing Open and selecting the document. Just double-clicking on the file’s icon usually produces an aggravating “Windows cannot open this file” message. Microsoft has instructions on how to use Works to open files at www.microsoft.com/products/works/more/worktogether.mspx.If Works doesn’t work, there are plenty of other ways to open that file. For example, Microsoft offers free viewer programs for Excel (support.microsoft.com/kb/273711) or Word (support.microsoft.com/kb/891090).Free open-source programs like OpenOffice.org let you open and edit Excel and Word files, too.

Output grew less than June’s 19.4 percent, the statistics bureau said. The slowdown is not likely to ease government concern that the economy may be overheating. “This is still a pretty robust number, highlighting the momentum of the Chinese economy supported by exports and retail demand,” said David Cohen, an economist at Action Economics in Singapore. It’s premature to speculate that the economy is slowing, Mr. Cohen said. Exports jumped 34.2 percent in July from a year earlier, the fastest pace in five months.

"'07-08-16,'0','“Investors are now starting to question economic projections, stock market projections and public officials,” said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at Standard & Poor’s Equity Research. “They are questioning American consumers’ continuing ability to spend beyond their means.”Early in the day, investors seemed to react positively to reports that suggested inflation was ebbing while manufacturing remained strong last month. The Federal Reserve also injected $7 billion into the financial markets by lending against securities.But that was not enough.Mr. Stovall said the decline late in the day suggested that many traders did not feel comfortable holding certain positions overnight because they lacked confidence about what would happen in overseas markets or at the start of trading today.As they have been for much of the last four weeks, stocks were driven by grim news from the credit markets.KKR Financial said it lost $40 million on the sale of $5.1 billion in mortgage securities and had another $5.8 billion in bonds to try to sell, which could result in the loss of another $250 million. Shares in KKR Financial, which went public in June 2005, fell 31 percent, to $10.52; the stock is down more than 60 percent for the year.The company restructured from a real estate investment trust to a limited liability company in May. It finances most of those securities through asset-backed commercial paper vehicles that were downgraded last night by the rating agency Fitch from its highest level to junk grade because of the decline in value of the underlying assets.The company said it would no longer invest in residential real estate and must decide what to do with the remaining portfolio of mortgage-backed securities.In a conference call last evening, Saturnino S. Fanlo, founding partner and chief executive of KKR Financial, forcefully offered specifics about the company’s financial condition, arguing that the slide in its stock price was an extreme overreaction. After hours, the stock made up some of its losses and was trading at $11.89.“Our maximum exposure totals $200 million, or 10 percent of our total capital,” Mr. Fanlo said, pointing out that the firm’s liquidity of $452 million “provides us with more than enough liquidity to cover any contingent liabilities.”On the call, analysts and shareholders cheered him on, congratulating him for “getting out ahead of the crisis,” as one analyst said, and one shareholder vowed to buy more stock. In a weary voice, Mr. Fanlo noted that executives from Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, including Henry Kravis and George Roberts, had been working closely with him to get through the “unprecedented” conditions the company faced.He said he had been through numerous financial crises “and this is the most disturbing liquidity crisis, with real impact throughout the economy if it does not rectify.”Before KKR Financial made its announcement, Kenneth Bruce, an analyst with Merrill Lynch, who affirmed his buy rating on Countrywide shares on Monday at a target price of $36, changed his view to sell and removed his target price. Shares of Countrywide fell 13 percent, to $21.29, and are down nearly 50 percent for the year.Countrywide and most other mortgage lenders rely heavily on borrowing from banks, brokerage firms and bond investors to make loans that they quickly turn around and sell to investors through mortgage securities. In his report, Mr. Bruce said he had previously underestimated the risks to Countrywide.“If enough financial pressure is placed on CFC or if the market loses confidence in its ability to function properly then the model can break, leading to an effective insolvency,” Mr. Bruce said in his note, referring to the company by its stock ticker symbol. “If liquidations do occur in a weak market, then it is possible for CFC to go bankrupt.”Mr. Bruce declined to comment through a spokeswoman, Carrie Gray. A Countrywide spokesman, Rick Simon, had no comment.At the end of June, Countrywide had access to $186.5 billion in bank loans and other sources of funding, according to CreditSights, a research firm in New York. The company, based in Calabasas, Calif., wrote $245 billion in home loans in the first six months, up 13 percent from the period last year and almost one and half times the figure for its closest rival, Wells Fargo, according to Inside Mortgage Finance. Countrywide has hired hundreds of sales representatives from failing competitors in recent months.One analyst suggested that the market would not recover until more funds and banks detailed their exposures to mortgage securities and other debt acquired during the recent credit boom.“The more funds that come to confession the better it is,” said Douglas M. Peta, chief market strategist at J. W. Seligman & Company. “Once all this stuff is out, all the analysts and the people with the sharp pencils can figure out how bad it is and they can put prices to it.”A more positive development, from Coventree, a Canadian financial services firm, had only a marginal impact on stocks. Coventree said it had sold $558 million of a kind of short-term debt known as commercial paper, though it was still having trouble with another $111 million in debt.In an indication that debt investors are worried that problems with mortgages will infect all aspects of the market, the price of three-month Treasury bills spiked yesterday. The yields on those bills, which move in the opposite direction from the price, fell to about 4 percent, from 4.65 percent on Tuesday.Investors are saying, “I want only the highest credit quality, where the principal is guaranteed by the Treasury,” said Brian J. Carlin, head of fixed-income trading at JPMorgan Private Bank.The S.& P. ended the day at 1,406.70; the Dow closed at 12,861.47; and the Nasdaq composite fell 40.29 points, or 1.6 percent, to 2,458.83. The 10-year Treasury note was little changed, at 100 6/32, and its yield was also little changed at 4.72 percent.'"
"'07-08-16,'0','Over the last two decades, mines in Utah and in some other coal-producing areas have pushed past depths of 1,500 feet, which had been considered an impassable barrier with older technologies. (Appalachian coal mines are typically much shallower than those in the West.)Seven of Utah’s 10 operating mines, including Crandall Canyon, take miners to depths of 1,600 to 2,000 feet below the surface, said James Kohler, chief of the solid minerals branch of the federal Bureau of Land Management in Utah, which monitors mines on its lands. An eighth Utah mine is set to push through 1,800 feet in the next few years.The days of easy, shallow coal are gone, Mr. Kohler said: “By necessity, we’re going deeper.”The chief executive of Murray Energy, Robert E. Murray, has said that no retreat mining was being done at the time of the Crandall Canyon collapse. But engineers and seismologists say that mountains honeycombed by mine tunnels do not always react predictably. Some seismic jolts in mine country have been associated with increased mining activity, while other bumps come much later, even in different parts of the mine, as the geology of the mountain settles out.One mine safety expert said that increasing pillar size to bolster safety could come at a price. Larger pillars mean smaller passageways, said Stephen Dmytriw, a civil engineer in the safety and health program at the Colorado School of Mines. And narrower tunnels mean less air circulation.Mr. Dmytriw said that some mines in Utah’s coal district, about 130 miles southeast of Salt Lake City, create methane, requiring extensive venting, but that Crandall Canyon was not one of them.Mr. Murray had initially expressed optimism that pockets of breathable air remained inside the mine. But testing devices lowered through small shafts bored vertically from the mountain above have provided conflicting signals. One test found very limited breathable air; a second found enough to support life.Richard E. Stickler, the director of the federal Mine Safety and Health Administration, said yesterday at a news conference at the mine that another seismic bump, on Tuesday night, had damaged a “continuous mining” machine, hampering efforts to tunnel a path to the miners. But Mr. Stickler said the machine had since been fixed and the tunneling continued. As of yesterday afternoon, 780 feet of debris had been cleared inside the mine, little more than a third of the distance to where the miners were believed to be.Relu Burlacu, a seismologist at the University of Utah, said the overall relationship of mining activity to underground jolts in central Utah was quite simple, but more complicated on a mine-by-mine basis.“If you increase production, and have more active mines,” Mr. Burlacu said, “you have a higher rate of seismicity.”Beyond increased production, he added, many factors can intervene. What is clear, he said, is that the deeper a mine, the more pressure on whatever is supporting it. “With depth, the overburden increases,” Mr. Burlacu said. “And when the overburden is bigger, the stress is bigger.”Over the last 10 years, Utah has produced 25 million to 26 million tons of coal a year, about doubling production since the 1980s, according to state figures. The number of mine-related seismic jolts of magnitude 2.0 or greater has also increased, according to the University of Utah, from an average of about 50 a year through much of the 1980s, to 150 on average in the 1990s, followed by a decline beginning in 2003 to last year, when there were 52 mining-related jolts of significant size.'"
"'07-08-16,'0','But the Fed’s position is that the problems in the markets are not likely to spill over into the rest of the economy. And the central bank remains fixed on bringing inflation down further, something it fears it cannot accomplish if it lowers rates now.“If you say we just lowered interest rates because the financial markets are upset, people are going to say that’s Ben Bernanke bailing out Wall Street,” said Jan Hatzius, chief United States economist for Goldman Sachs. “And clearly that’s not the perception they want.”The Labor Department said yesterday in its monthly survey of prices at the retail level that the Consumer Price Index rose 0.1 percent in July after an increase of 0.2 percent in June. From July 2006 to July 2007, prices climbed 2.4 percent, compared with a 2.7 percent annual increase in June.While inflation has improved over all, core consumer prices have not. For the month, they rose 0.2 percent, the same as in June. On a year-over-year basis, they rose 2.2 percent, the same as in June and May.“This is a sign that things are improving; however, there are still risks,” said Joseph Brusuelas, chief United States economist with IdeaGlobal. “Inflation’s sticky.”Falling energy costs helped keep inflation from climbing too rapidly. After rising considerably in the spring, energy costs fell 1 percent in July, with a 1.7 percent drop in the cost of gasoline, the government said.Price increases elsewhere, however, remained elevated. Health care costs continued to rise, increasing 0.6 percent, compared with a rise of 0.4 percent in June. They were up 4.3 percent in the last year.Hotel room prices are climbing as well, a jump that some economists said could be attributed to increased demand from foreign tourists attracted to the United States by a weaker dollar. The government’s calculation of lodging away from home rose 7.2 percent from July last year. During the first half of the year, according to PKF Hospitality Research, occupancy rates rose in several large cities, including New York, Chicago and Seattle.Food prices increased over all, but at a slower rate than in June. For the year, however, food prices were up 4.2 percent, almost double the 2.2 percent yearly increase last July.One area of improvement that has helped with the gradual moderation of core inflation has been housing costs. As of July, the seasonally adjusted six-month increase for a measurement of housing costs known as owners’ equivalent rent was 2.4 percent — less than half what it was a year earlier.As inventories of unsold homes grow, rent is becoming less expensive in many parts of the country. That has depressed the cost of housing, economists said.Gains in exports could help ease the housing industry’s drag on growth. The manufacturing numbers, released yesterday by the Fed, showed that industrial production continued to expand in July, aided by overseas demand. It rose 0.3 percent after increasing 0.6 percent in June.'"
"'07-08-16,'0','In contrast, Blockbuster outsources a portion of its customer service, and when people do call, they are encouraged to use the Web site instead. Its call center is open only during business hours, said Shane Evangelist, senior vice president and general manager for Blockbuster Online, because the majority of customers prefer e-mail support, which is available 24 hours a day. “Our online customers are comfortable using e-mail to communicate,” he said.The decision to invest heavily in telephone customer service was an expensive one for Netflix, but it may be one advantage that the company with the familiar red envelopes has over its rival with the blue ones, analysts say. “It’s vital in a world where they’re no longer growing their customer base,"" Mr. Adams said.Indeed, for the first time in its eight-year existence, Netflix has found itself losing customers. It is not the quality of customer service that is driving them away, but rather the heightened competition from Blockbuster. Late last year, soon after Blockbuster introduced its Total Access program, which allows members to swap a movie they have rented online for an in-store movie, the nationwide chain began gaining on Netflix’s base of 6.7 million subscribers.By the first quarter this year, after years of outstripping Blockbuster in subscriber growth, Netflix added 480,000 new subscribers while Blockbuster signed up 780,000 new members. And in the second quarter of this year, Netflix, which prides itself on customer loyalty, lost 55,000 customers. Blockbuster added 525,000, bringing its total to 3.6 million.The Hillsboro operation, which occupies about 30,000 square feet of a low building in an office park, is intended to keep the red envelopes coming. Michael Osier, vice president for information technology operations and customer service, said he rejected cities like Phoenix, Salt Lake City and Las Vegas, which are known as call-center capitals, because of their high employee turnover rates. He settled on the greater Portland area because of the genial attitude on the part of most service workers.“In hotels and coffee shops and the airport, it’s amazing how consistent people are in their politeness and empathy,” said Mr. Osier, who is based at Netflix headquarters in Los Gatos, Calif. “There’s an operational language in the industry that people are so jaded about — phrases like ‘due to high caller volume.’ We’re very consciously trying to counter that mentality.”Netflix’s decision to eliminate the e-mail feature was made after a great deal of research, Mr. Osier said. He looked at two other companies with reputations for superb phone-based customer service, Southwest Airlines and American Express, and saw that customers preferred human interaction over e-mail messages. “My assessment was that a world-class e-mail program was still going to be consistently lower in quality and effectiveness than a phone program,” he said.When Mr. Osier presented his findings in January to fellow executives, Reed Hastings, the Netflix chief executive, sent an enthusiastic message, BlackBerry to BlackBerry, from across the room. Mr. Hastings quickly became a supporter of the e-mail elimination project.The company has tried to give the service representatives more discretion in deciding when to assuage disgruntled callers with bonus discs and account credits — and they are allowed to err on the side of generosity. More often than not, a month’s credit will be issued or a missing disc marked simply as lost, and the customer will not be charged. Netflix places no particular requirements on call duration, preferring that customer service representatives take the time they need to keep a customer happy and loyal.Ms. Funk, 36, said some people call because they are lonely. Her lengthiest call of that kind lasted 35 minutes. Others need basic help with their computers or with the Internet. Some people do not own a computer and call regularly to have a call center employee rearrange the titles in their queue.More often than Netflix might like these days, people call to cancel their subscriptions. One reason for emphasizing direct phone contact over e-mail messages is that on the phone, a Netflix employee has a fighting chance of persuading the customer to stay.And it is up to the call center representatives to help retain customers. Autumn Daste, 30, who has worked at the call center for two months, managed to halt one potential defection recently when a call was routed to her from a polite but unhappy woman in New Jersey who had not received any movies recently.Ms. Daste called up the member’s account information on her screen, including the type of service to which she subscribed, the frequency with which the member ordered movies, the number of months she had been a member, the number of times she had contacted Netflix in the past and a brief description of what those calls had been about.Ms. Daste pointed out, ever so politely, that no movies had been sent to her because the woman’s queue was empty. “There’s nothing on your list that’s of interest to me,” said the caller, referring to the 80,000 movies Netflix carries.Undeterred, Ms. Daste suggested they find a movie together. The woman mentioned one she had been wanting to see for a while, an Indian film titled “Fire.” Within seconds, Ms. Daste had it on her screen. She added it to the customer’s queue and told her she would be receiving it shortly. Customer pleased. Disaster averted.Ms. Funk has been working at Netflix for eight months, a veteran by call center standards. (Mr. Osier said his goal was to keep people there for an average of two years, twice as long as the industry average.) At $12.50 an hour, she said, the pay is slightly higher than in her previous job, in retail sales.One of the first questions customers ask, Ms. Funk said, is where she is, and they express their approval at the answer. “They like hearing it’s not being outsourced,” she said. Very few callers have asked about the disappearance of the e-mail option, she said.Disappearance of discs, though, remains a common customer anxiety. Shortly before clocking out for the day recently, Ms. Funk took a call from woman who had just found a DVD she had reported lost a few weeks earlier. It was in her husband’s car. “All right, I need to get a new husband,” she told Ms. Funk, who gave a sympathetic chortle in reply.'"
"'07-08-16,'0','The data collected by the sensors could be used to make critical decisions, like when to allow power plants — such as Dynegy’s huge Roseton plant on the Hudson in Newburgh, N.Y. — to run their cooling systems so they do not harm migrating fish. The Roseton plant is permitted to draw 924 million gallons a day to cool its generators, although the company says it rarely uses that much. But each time the plant takes in water, fish that get caught in the intake are killed, and the warm water the plant later discharges can harm many species.Beyond the immediate application of the new technology in this region, the partners hope that the methods they develop could be used anywhere in the world where people rely on rivers. The sensors could detect the presence of parasites or pollution in third world rivers long before they reach populated areas, for example, giving officials time to warn the public and provide alternatives.The Beacon Institute and I.B.M. also plan to sponsor an international conference on rivers and estuaries next year.“This is the future,” said John Cronin, the institute’s director, who has spent years battling corporations that polluted the Hudson. “If you can predict, you can protect.”Under terms of the partnership, I.B.M. will assign six engineers to work on the project and will make available some of the data-collecting systems it has developed at its laboratories throughout the Hudson Valley. The company will also work over the next few years with Beacon Institute marine biologists and scientists to develop tools to analyze the flood of data that will be collected.The Beacon Institute, which Gov. George E. Pataki created in 2000 as a kind of river-focused rival to the famous Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution on Cape Cod, will use the array of real-time monitoring devices the way a doctor uses the data from a heart monitor, assessing the condition of the river from moment to moment.The comprehensive system, which could be in place within a few years, will provide far more detailed information than has been available before, people involved with the project say. And a new I.B.M. technology will let scientists analyze countless bits of data at the same time that it is being collected.Construction is nearing completion on a new educational center inside the remains of an old brick factory on Denning’s Point, a spit of land here in Beacon that juts out into the Hudson. Plans call for two more buildings on the eight-acre site, including a state-of-the-art research laboratory that is being designed with help from I.B.M. engineers.Sharon L. Nunes, an I.B.M. vice president, is leading the Big Green Innovations group, which the company created this year to develop new businesses using I.B.M. technology to address environmental problems.Ms. Nunes called the application of advanced technology in solving environmental problems like those in the Hudson “the new moon race,” saying it would entice young people to study physics and engineering, the same way the space program did in the 1960s.Mr. Cronin said the environmental movement is entering a new era, in which the confrontations of the past — bringing big lawsuits against corporations to block environmentally harmful projects or to force polluters to clean up — no longer work.“I don’t see this as two different groups of people,” said Mr. Cronin, who for 17 years was the Hudson’s “riverkeeper,” a private pollution watchdog. “There isn’t room for permanent enemies anymore.”Mr. Cronin said nonprofit environmental organizations alone could never afford to hire the experts or develop the technology required to meet contemporary environmental problems, like global climate change.But corporations like I.B.M. have that expertise on hand, he said, adding that a whole new generation of engineers — most born after the first Earth Day, in 1970 — see protecting the environment as a natural outgrowth of their work.Others involved in the environmental movement agree that the time for confrontation has passed. “There are real opportunities for partnerships like this to provide the expertise and capacity that nonprofit groups don’t have,” said Steve Rosenberg, senior vice president of Scenic Hudson, an environmental group.Of course, such partnerships are not always possible, he said, citing the example of the long conflict between environmental watchdogs and General Electric that led to efforts to remove PCBs from the Hudson.But there is no such enmity evident in the agreement between the Beacon Institute and I.B.M. The partners plan to work closely with colleges and universities along the Hudson, providing research opportunities for students and faculty, some of whom are eager to get involved.“If you look at large ecosystems — rain forests, the plains, the Arctic — they all require a scale of cooperation and deployment quite different from what historically an individual researcher could measure at one place in one time,” said Arthur C. Sanderson, a professor of electrical, computer and systems engineering at the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, who is participating in the project. “This effort is very consistent with that emerging aspect of doing science on a large scale.”Professor Sanderson helped develop a solar-powered submarine with complex computerized sensing equipment that can monitor changing conditions in a river like the Hudson.An important element of the joint program will be its accessibility not just to researchers and policy makers, but also to schools and universities. Much of the monitoring data will be available online as it comes in.“What this does is provide a kind of window into this large, complex environment that was never before possible,” Professor Sanderson said. “You can imagine a student that might be in a Hudson Valley middle school or one of the universities essentially being able to observe the system themselves, to access the data and create their own hypotheses.”'"
"'07-08-16,'0','WASHINGTON, Aug. 15 — In a step underscoring that much of the risk of air travel occurs on the ground, airlines have agreed to use their cockpit simulators to train pilots to taxi, the Federal Aviation Administration said Wednesday.All airline pilots take regular training in simulators, but mostly for events that could occur in flight, like engine failure, other mechanical problems or severe weather. Now, after a spate of recent cases in which planes nearly collided on runways, simulator training focusing specifically on taxiing has become part a package of quick fixes worked out in a meeting of about 40 representatives of airlines, airports, air traffic controllers and regulators.The F.A.A., which has been working since 1999 to reduce “runway incursions” like the recent incidents, had already decided to require 73 airports to add paint to make it clearer to pilots where they would have to stop to avoid intruding on runways. The job was supposed to be done by September 2008, but on Wednesday, Bobby Sturgell, the agency’s deputy administrator, said that in another of the new solutions, the airports had agreed to do the work “in the next 60 days or as soon as possible.”In addition, he said, the agency will study whether to change the way that controllers issue clearances to pilots. Controllers have long been permitted to give a single clearance that covers a plane all the way from a terminal to the end of a runway. One alternative would be to give much shorter clearances, from intersection to intersection, although that could cause delays.Such a step would add to one that took effect last month, in which controllers, in giving clearances, must recite a list of runways to be crossed.'"
"'07-08-16,'0','Add Jimmy Neutron to the list of licensed characters that are going on a diet.Nickelodeon, the children’s television network, said Wednesday that it would prohibit the use of its characters on junk food products, except on special occasions like Halloween. The characters include SpongeBob SquarePants, Dora the Explorer and the Rugrats.Those characters will be allowed to appear only on packaged food products that meet “better for you” criteria established by Nickelodeon’s marketing clients. The changes will become effective in 2009, when the current two-year licensing agreements expire.The announcement was made just days after Discovery Kids made a similar announcement and nearly a month after 11 major food and beverage companies — including McDonald’s, Kellogg and Kraft Foods — agreed that they would stop advertising unhealthy products to children under 12. Those 11 companies represent two-thirds of the children’s advertising market. In October, Walt Disney announced that its characters would be allowed only on products that met certain nutritional standards.By promoting empty calories, the food companies and the networks have come under increasing criticism for having contributed to the obesity epidemic among children, and their responses are in part an effort to stave off demands that the government regulate children’s advertising.Even so, one of the vocal critics of children’s advertising praised Nickelodeon’s initiative.“Nickelodeon is really the 800-pound gorilla of children’s programming,” said Michael F. Jacobson, executive director of the Center for Science in the Public Interest. “It’s a very important step for children’s health, assuming the criteria are reasonable.”'"
"'07-08-16,'0','The Khampa Festival in Qinghai Province is one of the largest on the calendar and traditionally draws Tibetans from all over western China. This year, for the first time, local officials tried to use the event to promote tourism and development in one of the poorest areas of China. As the muted response to the announcers suggested, however, the event had also acquired a political subtext: the continuing struggle between China and its Tibetan minority over cultural identity and religious freedom.In recent weeks, China has announced new regulations governing the reincarnation of Tibetan clergy and has acted swiftly against Tibetans at other summer festivals who have hoisted banners with the likeness of their exiled spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, and in one case, urged people to shout if they wanted the Dalai Lama to be allowed to return from exile.Most of this province, and parts of several others, including Sichuan and Yunnan, were long part of Tibet itself before China’s People’s Liberation Army marched into the area in 1950 to enforce Beijing’s claim.With so many security forces on hand in this modest town of about 40,000, nestled in a valley surrounded by high mountains, there was little chance of an outright demonstration in favor of the Dalai Lama. The test of wills played itself out instead around a theme unlikely to have been noticed by many of the tourists from China’s Han majority: whether or not to wear animal fur.The ceremonial wearing of animal fur has been raised to the status of a political issue in western China, since the Dalai Lama released a statement two years ago urging Tibetans to reject the longtime practice as inconsistent with Buddhism. Reportedly, the Dalai Lama was responding to complaints from Indian conservationists that Tibetans’ fondness for skins from tigers and other endangered species was hastening their disappearance.As word of the Dalai Lama’s suggestion spread across western China, some Tibetan communities responded by publicly burning their furs, while others simply stopped using furs in ceremonies. This perceived act of obedience to a man whom the Chinese government has long vilified as a “splittist,” meaning secessionist, appears to have angered the authorities.Zhou Hongyuan, deputy governor of Yushu Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, denied that participants had been ordered to wear animal skins and furs, but he supported the practice. “We are an ethnic region, and we want to create a festive atmosphere and promote our uniqueness,” he said. “It has been our tradition for thousands of years to wear fur.”Members of Tibetan performance troupes who came here from towns in Qinghai said local officials had urged them to continue wearing their traditional outfits. Judging from the appearance of one group after another, however, the call went almost completely unheeded. During several days of festivities, a visitor was hard pressed to find any conspicuous displays of fur.On the eve of their troupe’s performance, a couple of Tibetan dancers from Nangqian County, in Qinghai, practiced twirling moves in their full regalia, including long strands of blue and orange beads that shone in the afternoon sun as they spun.Asked if he was wearing any animal fur, the man exclaimed, “Absolutely not!” What ensued was a very careful conversation in which the man insisted that wearing fur was against his religion, and then acknowledged receiving “teaching” on the practice two years ago.Where had the teaching come from? “That’s not convenient to say,” the man’s wife and fellow dancer put in. Asked if their instruction had come from the Dalai Lama, the couple’s faces lit up, and the man reached out to eagerly shake hands. “The government told us we have to wear fur, but we’re not going to do it,” he said. “There are 32 people in our troupe. We’ve agreed that just one of us will wear a small piece.”The dancers were not alone in their circumspection. With Beijing constantly on guard for anything that smacks of separatism, people here seem to measure their words carefully.At a monastery perched on a hill high above this town where he receives visitors, Yushu’s holiest Tibetan Buddhist monk, Aenpo Kyabgon, gingerly parried questions about the fur controversy, saying he had avoided the festival altogether.The monk, who grew up in India and now lives in Australia, was allowed to enter the country recently with a warning against engaging in politics.“I don’t believe in saying you must or mustn’t do something,” he said elliptically. “These things depend upon the individual. But from the Buddhist spiritual point of view, we definitely have to refrain from certain things, such as violence in killing animals.”'"
"'07-08-16,'0','ALBANY, Aug. 15 (AP) — New York consumers will get as much as $4.5 million in refunds from a South Dakota bank under a settlement of accusations that it used deceptive and illegal tactics to market credit cards to people with poor credit ratings.The New York attorney general’s office said Wednesday that the bank, First Premier Bank, would also pay a $100,000 civil penalty and $5,000 in costs, and would change the way it markets and charges for credit cards.The bank acknowledged the settlement but contested Attorney General Andrew M. Cuomo’s description of its business practices. The bank said it expected few claims to be filed against the refund pool because its “policy already is to offer a full refund of all fees upon request to customers who are not satisfied with the credit card.”Any of the $4.5 million not paid to consumers will be kept by the state to cover the costs of the investigation, according to the settlement agreement.The investigation was prompted by complaints from consumers who had responded to offers for a card with a $2,000 credit limit, a 9.9 percent fixed interest rate and no processing fee.'"

"'07-08-16,'0','“You tend to forget how good opera is until you actually hear it,” Tony Zertuche, a 36-year-old playwright, said Tuesday afternoon. He was waiting in a long line in Bryant Park to buy $25 tickets to coming New York City Opera productions, which were being sold after the company’s Afternoon Arias lunchtime concert in the park.Since the fall of 2005 City Opera’s Opera for All plan has offered $25 tickets to some performances at the start of the season. For 2007-8 the company will sell at least 50 $25 tickets for orchestra seats for every performance of the season.It’s people like Mr. Zertuche (who said he liked opera but had never seen a live production) that City Opera hopes to woo. Also waiting to buy tickets on Tuesday was Tae Kim, 25, a student who was new to opera. Another customer was Alex Colby, 37, who said he had a subscription to the Metropolitan Opera last year but had never been to City Opera. He said he was curious to compare the companies’ productions of “La Bohème.”An excerpt from that opera was included on Tuesday’s program at Bryant Park, featuring the soprano Inna Dukach as Mimì, a role she will sing with City Opera next month. The other four able artists, accompanied by Gerald Steichen on piano, were Michael Chioldi, a baritone; Jennifer Tiller, a mezzo-soprano; Christopher Jackson, a tenor; and Malia Merad, a soprano. Their singing was interspersed with upbeat marketing pitches by Cori Ellison, dramaturge for City Opera, and Midge Woolsey, a program host on WQXR, the classical music radio station owned by The New York Times Company.Most outdoor concerts are acoustically problematic, and Bryant Park is particularly noisy. It was difficult to discern more than an outline of each amplified aria amid the sirens, chatter and construction noise.Still, Ms. Dukach and Ms. Merad both sounded lovely in their arias: “Donde lieta uscì” from Puccini’s “Bohème” and “Glitter and Be Gay” from Bernstein’s “Candide.” Ms. Tiller sang an excerpt from Barber’s “Vanessa” well. The program also included Mr. Chioldi singing the Prologue of Leoncavallo’s “Pagliacci” and Mr. Jackson in an excerpt from Lehar’s “Das Land des Lachelns.”To judge by the line to buy tickets after the performance, many listeners who had sprawled out under the broiling midday sun had enjoyed themselves.'"
"'07-08-16,'0','In a statement released early this morning, the company also said that 90 percent of the home loans it will now make will be to standards set by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the big purchasers of mortgage loans, because it is not able to sell them to other buyers.“As we have previously discussed, secondary market demand for non-agency mortgage-backed securities has been disrupted in recent weeks,” David Sambol, the company’s president and chief operating officer, said in a statement.The reversal in fortune in the housing market was further illustrated by figures released by the Commerce Department today that showed construction of new homes fell in July to the lowest level in more than a decade, dropping 6.1 percent last month.The Wall Street declines came after stocks in Asia continued their downward spiral, led by shares in South Korea, as local investors returned from a national holiday there and joined the stampede by foreign investors trying to sell.Across Europe, markets were also sustaining heavy losses in early trading.“It’s a kind of a panic among individual investors,” said Cho Hong Rae, head of research at Korea Investment & Securities in Seoul, adding that domestic retail investors had up until today generally been buying shares as they declined.The South Korean benchmark stock index suffered its biggest decline in more than five years today, falling nearly 7 percent late in the afternoon in Asia after an initial 10 percent plunge that forced the Korea Exchange to suspend trading for 20 minutes.Similar declines occurred in Indonesia and the Philippines, where stocks also fell by roughly 7.7 percent and 6 percent, respectively. Declines in the region’s other big markets were less severe, but still dramatic: Japan’s benchmark Nikkei 225 stock average fell by about 2 percent; and Hong Kong’s benchmark dropped by about 3.5 percent.Chinese stocks were lower too. During recent trading sessions, they have brushed off drops in other parts of the world.Australia was also hit today by more repercussions from the credit crisis in the United States. Rams Home Loans Group, a nonbank lender which earlier in the week warned that its earnings could be hurt by rising costs for its United States borrowings, confirmed today that it had been unable to refinance $5 billion in debt.Analysts in Australia said Rams’s problems were unlikely to have much effect on the country’s banks, because they do not rely significantly on borrowing from the United States.“In the end the impact on them will not be so severe,” said Ben Zucker, an analyst at Macquarie Bank in Sydney.Nonetheless, companies and financial institutions that had taken advantage of a booming American appetite for debt to borrow United States dollars cheaply and fund costs at home in Australia where the currency has been appreciating are likely to suffer a sudden whiplash effect now as interest rates rise and the United States dollar regains ground, he said.In South Korea, Mr. Cho said that most domestic selling was still by individuals trying to unload individual stocks. So far, he said, local mutual funds were not seeing a market increase in redemptions that would force them to join the selling. And automatic contributions to pension funds were still being made to big institutions, which were taking advantage of the latest declines to buy stocks more cheaply, he said.Mr. Cho said that Korean financial institutions, like others around Asia, had only small direct exposures to United States subprime mortgages. Having suffered through the Asian financial crisis and a similar blowout in personal debts in 2002, Korean banks have become relatively conservative, he said.So have Korean regulators, who Mr. Cho said have been putting the brakes on the property market by boosting restrictions on how much banks can lend for property investments.As a result, Mr. Cho said, property prices have stagnated, but borrowers are less likely to default because they took on too much debt.But the same might not hold true of Korean companies. In a report last month examining the creditworthiness of Asian companies, Lehman Brothers strategist Paul Schulte observed that some of the biggest gains by Korean stocks had come in shares of companies with a high reliance on debt financing.A somewhat brighter picture has emerged in Australia. Notwithstanding Rams’s predicament, which was caused by its borrowing, the quality of mortgages in Australia has been steadily improving, according to Mr. Zucker. After several years of slumping prices in big eastern markets like Sydney and Melbourne, prices are now picking up. With joblessness at record lows and Australian economic growth quickening, banks still appear to be on solid footing, he said.Shortly after the open in Europe, London’s FTSE 100 was down about 2 percent to 5,982.60; in Frankfurt, Germany, the Dax Index was down about 2 percent to 7,299.79; and markets in Stockholm, Madrid and Milan were also down about 2 percent.In the United States, the decline in the stock index futures follows comments from William Poole, St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank president, after Wednesday’s stock market close. He said that the market turmoil has not undermined the United States economy and there is no need for an inter-meeting rate cute, Reuters reported.'"

Peace, 35, of Virginia Beach, and Quanis L. Phillips, 28, of Atlanta, accepted one felony count each related to a dog fighting ring the government says was run from Vick’s property in Surry, Va.Both defendants pledged to help the government’s case, signing statements that would be included at a possible trial of Vick, who faces three felony charges related to dog fighting. The charges could carry up to five years in prison and as much as a $250,000 fine if he is found guilty.A lawyer for Vick, Lawrence H. Woodward, Jr., sat in the court room for both hearings, but declined to comment on whether his client would plead today. Court officials indicated this afternoon that there are no furthur hearings scheduled for Judge Hudson.United States District Judge Henry E. Hudson ordered United States Marshals to take Phillips into custody at the end of his hearing because he had tested positive for drugs while free on bond in the case.'"
"'07-08-17,'1','Ignoring a late-session rally on Wall Street Thursday, stocks in Hong Kong and South Korea followed suit, plunging as much as 5 percent before recovering somewhat. Hong Kong’s benchmark ended 2.8 percent lower while South Korea’s finished down 3.4 percent. The yen rose as high as 112.01 to the dollar. Commodity prices, including such traditional safe havens as gold, also fell.The Nikkei 225 has now fallen to levels not seen since August 7, 2006. Hong Kong’s stocks are back where they were in late May and Australian shares have retreated to where they were in March. The Morgan Stanley Capital International Asia-Pacific Index, which tracks stocks around the region, fell 8.3 percent this week to its lowest since March.Analysts have been observing a reversal of carry trades for several weeks now, explaining in part why the dollar has fallen roughly 10 percent against the yen since June. But the trend appeared to have picked up dramatically today. It was unclear why investors were prompted to accelerate their repurchases of yen so suddenly, but analysts said increasing volatility in emerging markets was raising the risks inherent in the carry trade. In the current environment, risk is something that investors are rapidly trying to back away from.“It’s become a race to reduce risk,” Satoru Asatani, a fund manager at Shinko Investment Trust in Tokyo, told Bloomberg. “People don’t care about the valuations now, they’re just selling whatever they can.”Analysts have stressed that many of the declines in markets are now as the result of forced selling among fund managers. As investors lose money or become concerned that they will amid declining prices, they begin to cash in their holdings in funds, forcing managers to sell stocks even if they don’t believe doing so is wise. Falling asset prices compels many brokers to ask investors to deposit more cash against any money they may have borrowed — a margin call — which forces more investors to sell their holdings to raise cash. All of this selling exacerbates the pace of declines, creating a vicious cycle in which more selling begets even more selling.“If you’re investing overseas and the yen starts to go against you or what you’re investing in goes against you, then you start to sell that and maybe the yen gets stronger. That panics people into covering,” said Ed Merner who manages the roughly $400 million Atlantis Japan Growth Fund in Tokyo.A rising yen makes Japanese exports relatively more expensive for consumers abroad, particularly in the United States, where the widening fears about tighter credit and housing loans is raising concerns that consumer spending may suffer.Shares in Toyota fell 4.4 percent, their biggest decline since 2001, while digital camera-maker Canon slid 4.9 percent to a one-year low. Other exporters like Nintendo also fell. Declining commodity prices also sent related shares such as Mitsubishi Corp., which trades in oil and metals, lower. Sumitomo Metal Mining suffered its biggest drop since 1999.While much of the carry trade is conducted by hedge funds, analysts say Japanese retail investors are also a big contributor. Overseas stocks and bonds are increasingly popular among investors who have little confidence in their own stock market and economy. And while Japanese retail investors don’t necessarily borrow the yen to buy these products, analysts say the effect is much the same.But now, with carry trades being swiftly unwound, the currencies that carry traders were buying have been falling as fast as the yen has been rising. On Friday, the Australian and New Zealand dollars suffered their biggest weekly declines against the United States currency in at least 18 years.The volatility in stocks, bonds and currencies also hit commodities, even those traditionally regarded as safe havens such as gold. Gold prices in Tokyo fell to $646.75 an ounce on Friday, from $650.50 in New York Thursday.In Tokyo, forced selling has also occurred due to the collapse of a popular strategy among quantitative fund managers, who use sophisticated computer modeling to devise investment plays. One such strategy was to buy stocks with low prices relative to earnings and sell those with high prices relative to earnings. But with virtually all stock prices falling amid the bedlam being created by mortgage concerns in the United States, mangers pursuing this strategy have been forced to sell the stocks they considered most valuable and buy back those they considered overvalued. Consequently, analysts have observed that some of what they consider the markets’ most overpriced stocks have outperformed stocks they consider good values throughout the latest declines.However unfavorable global market volatility may have made the carry trade in recent weeks, analysts say it is unlikely to disappear as long as Japanese interest rates are so much lower than interest rates elsewhere around the world. Japanese bank accounts typically pay less than half a percentage point of interest per year. That means that even parking funds in American dollars is profitable to a Japanese investor provided the dollar declines don’t erase those gains.Returns can be even higher if those yen are invested in places such as Australia and New Zealand, where rates are even higher and a commodities boom has been pushing up inflation and causing currencies to appreciate.While conventional economic theory holds that lowering interest rates and thereby reducing borrowing costs stimulates economic growth, some in Japan say the reverse may be true. In a nation where the predominantly elderly population keeps most of its money in savings, higher interest rates would boost their disposable income and stimulate consumer spending.'"
"'07-08-17,'1','He said he did not believe that Ms. Sparks-Beddoe had done anything improper. Mr. Mitnick was asked if he or other administration officials could be faulted for potentially facilitating Ms. Sparks-Beddoe’s access to the Public Service Commission before she was confirmed and left her job at the utility.“She had, from what I could see, over the period of months, a few discussions with P.S.C. personnel, and I ask you the question, could she have not?” he said. “What would people have said if we had completely isolated the person we expected imminently would be chair from any conversations?”Mr. Mitnick also offered his most detailed public account of his interactions with Ms. Buley. He said he only called her to ask for her resignation, which she subsequently declined to give. He said that as part of the transition of administrations in Albany, he asked 10 officials at three commissions or authorities to resign and that he had acted after consulting with his boss at the time, Richard Baum, the governor’s top deputy.Mr. Mitnick said he did try to persuade Ms. Buley to take a job in the press office of a public authority when they met in April at a cafeteria in the state Capitol.Lawmakers, including Democrats, have said the reports of Mr. Mitnick’s dealings with Ms. Buley are consistent with a pattern of heavy-handedness by the governor and Mr. Baum. Such criticism was inflamed by Attorney General Andrew M. Cuomo’s report last month finding that members of the governor’s staff had misused the State Police to smear the governor’s principal political rival, Joseph L. Bruno, the Senate majority leader.Mr. Mitnick said he sought resignations at three entities — the Public Service Commission, the State Energy Research and Development Authority and the New York Power Authority — that are ostensibly independent of the governor’s direct control. Governors in both parties, however, have long sought to exert influence over authorities and commissions.“I think there has been a troubling interference in agencies that were not of the executive branch,” said Assemblyman Richard L. Brodsky, a Westchester County Democrat. “We’re in a period where presidents and governors and mayors view the legislative process, or even the constitutional separation of powers, as nuisances.”Ms. Buley’s service in state government has been the subject of political scrutiny in the past.When she was appointed last year by Gov. George E. Pataki, her husband was serving as counsel to the Republican State Committee. Her post had a six-year term and a $109,800 salary. In 2000, Ms. Buley changed her party affiliation from Republican to independent before being appointed to a different board, a tactic the Pataki administration was widely known to have used to navigate rules requiring bipartisanship on various boards.Complicating Inspector General Hamann’s investigation of Mr. Mitnick are growing concerns among lawmakers that she is caught in conflicts of interest. Ms. Hamann has been criticized for conducting a limited investigation of the administration’s efforts to tarnish Mr. Bruno and for revealing only last week that her office had ended its investigation after deciding that it had a conflict of interest since Ms. Hamann reports to Mr. Baum.In the Mitnick case, Ms. Hamann is investigating someone who reported to Mr. Baum.“We’re aware of these concerns, these issues, and we are proceeding appropriately,” said Stephen DelGiacco, a spokesman for the inspector general, who has said the investigation would be wrapped up in a matter of weeks.'"

Mr. Karamanlis’s New Democracy Party swept to power in national elections in 2004, ousting the Socialists, who had held power for a decade.

"'07-08-17,'1','News this week that the Bush administration is on the verge of adding the Revolutionary Guard Corps of Iran to its ever-expanding list of foreign terrorist organizations — the count stands at 42 undesirables, headlined by Al Qaeda, Hezbollah and Hamas — was not exactly music to the ears of Gary M. Osen, a lawyer on a personal and professional campaign to sue banks that he believes bankroll terrorist activities.But the impending censure does strike him as progress in a war on terror that in his opinion has, until now, pretty much been the equivalent of “trying to shut down the phone company by going to people’s homes and apartments and individually smashing their phones instead of destroying the satellites and cables that conduct the signals.” His home library includes titles like “Alms for Jihad” and “The Road to Martyrs’ Square.” He’s big on simple analogies to illustrate complex conundrums.“The move is indicative of a larger push to isolate Iran not just diplomatically, but to inhibit its ability to access financial markets, including ours,” he said, sitting in the Midtown office of his publicist, 5W Public Relations, which manages his speaking and writing assignments. His topic is terrorists and their fund-raising, as well as the damage, and restitution that needs to be made, to victims of terrorism.Mr. Osen represents 55 plaintiffs in his case against Arab Bank — a Palestinian owned, Jordan-based bank with $28 billion in worldwide deposits — which is accused of channeling money from Saudi Arabia to the families of Palestinian suicide bombers in Israel. Sarri Singer, the daughter of a New Jersey state senator, Robert W. Singer, was hurt in a 2003 Jerusalem bus bombing, and is among his clients. A chance shift to another seat left her with ruptured eardrums and other injuries repaired by surgery. The seat she vacated? Its occupant died.Mr. Osen is also the lead plaintiff’s lawyer in Weiss v. National Westminster Bank, a suit that alleges that National Westminster, a British bank that is the largest subsidiary of the Royal Bank of Scotland, provides banking services and maintains accounts for Interpal, a British entity that was termed a “specially designated global terrorist” group by the United States in 2003. Interpal has been linked to Hamas. Those accounts have been frozen pending investigation and litigation. Crédit Lyonnais of France stopped dealing with Interpal in 2003 after Mr. Osen began nosing around.'"

"'07-08-17,'1','The entire flood system still provides much less protection than New Orleans needs, and the pre-Katrina patchwork of levees, floodwalls and gates that a Corps of Engineers investigation called “a system in name only” is still just that.The corps has strengthened miles of floodwalls, but not always in places where people live. It has built up breached walls on the east side of one major canal, but left the west side, which stood up to Hurricane Katrina, lower and thus more vulnerable. It has not closed the canals that have often been described as funnels for floodwaters into the city.And its most successful work, building enormous floodgates to cut off the fingerlike canals that brought so much flooding into the city, had a divisive effect. The gates now protect prosperous neighborhoods like Lakeview, and though corps officials say there has been no favoritism, the effect has been to draw out old resentments and conspiracy theories in a city that never lacked for them.“We have spent a lot of money and gotten some very good patches, but we’re putting them on this decayed old quilt,” said Robert G. Bea, a professor of engineering at the University of California, Berkeley, who is an author of an independent report on the levee failures. “We’re still with this damned patchwork quilt.”As a result, the city still lacks a system that can stand up to that 1-in-100 storm, let alone one like Hurricane Katrina, which the corps calls a 1-in-396 storm. The work that could build the more robust system — originally estimated at $7 billion, and now at least twice that — will not be completed until 2011 at the earliest, and experts agree that even that level of protection will be less than the city needs.The corps is working on a two-year, $20 million study to find ways of providing even more protection, but it will not even be released until December.Without a strong rampart of protection against storms, New Orleans will have a hard time persuading its far-flung residents and businesses to return and rebuild. Matt McBride, an engineer who became an anti-corps gadfly on flood-protection issues, left the city along with his wife after deciding he simply did not trust the new system.“There’s too many things that can go wrong,” Mr. McBride said.Maggie Carver, a Gentilly resident now living in Woodstock, N.Y., but hoping to get back, said she thought that all the time and work would have resulted in more progress and a clearer sense of safety than she had seen.“If I sell my house and put everything into rebuilding and living in New Orleans and it happens again, then where am I?” Ms. Carver asked. “I’m in a boat somewhere with four Jack Russell terriers and my grandson. I won’t have anything.”The corps has hardly been idle in the two years since the flooding. It quickly mobilized a force that grew to as many as 3,300 workers in the New Orleans area, and its cranes and bulldozers belch exhaust at waterways all over town, installing walls of concrete, massive pumps and mounds of earthwork.Ultimately, though, the corps was trying to patch up a 350-mile system that was unfinished and vulnerable long before Hurricane Katrina, and the haphazard results are clear. It has repaired breaches on the east bank of a waterway called the Industrial Canal with 4,000 feet of stolid, well-armored floodwall to protect the still-devastated Lower Ninth Ward, even though few people are living there and there is little sign of the neighborhood’s return.Across the canal from that floodwall, however, the walls that stood up to the storm have not yet been raised, even though they protect an inhabited neighborhood. That means they remain at their pre-Katrina height, lower than the new wall and vulnerable to being overtopped. They have been strengthened against catastrophic failure if water flows over the top, but floodwaters would nonetheless flow into Gentilly.Meanwhile, the Mississippi River Gulf Outlet, an old navigation channel that many scientists say destroyed wetlands and contributed to a funnel effect that increased the damage to the city, has yet to be sealed off. The corps has said that proposals from contractors for doing so are on their way, but that work, too, may not be complete before 2011.Then there are the new pumps at the mouths of the city’s main drainage canals, which will be turned on if the huge new floodgates have to be closed to keep out lake water in a storm. Two reports said that the pumps, ordered in a rush of planning before the 2006 storm season, were a troubled operation from the start, and that if a storm had hit in the first year after Hurricane Katrina, severe flooding could have occurred.Experts who have looked at the situation in the year since then say that things have improved, and the pumps are working as planned. But community activists say they suspect that the corps has not yet fully fixed the problems.On a broader scale, the essential but daunting work of restoring the wetlands along the Gulf Coast, which can reduce the effect of storm surges, has yet to get under way in earnest.Col. Jeffrey A. Bedey, commander of the corps’ Hurricane Protection Office, acknowledged that the work so far has been piecemeal, because the scale of project is so enormous. The drive to provide protection against that 1-in-100 storm by 2011, Colonel Bedey said, is more thorough.He said the maps that will predict the impact of that work, which could be published before the end of August, “should show Upper Gentilly looking very good,” and much of the rest of the city besides.And so, he said, the analysis that many people will have to make is, “Am I really willing to take the risk between 2007 and 2011” that no big storm will overpower the work done so far?That requires more than an analysis of risk; it requires a calculus of hope. And it is not a question that needs to be asked only in New Orleans. It is the same question that comes up when a steam pipe in New York City explodes or a bridge 1,200 miles up the Mississippi from New Orleans collapses. Getting infrastructure right is hard, and keeping it strong takes vigilance. And that means safety, uncomfortably, is a relative thing.“If people were looking for a quick and easy answer — is it safe? — there is no easy answer,” said David E. Daniel, the president of the University of Texas at Dallas and the head of a panel that monitors the corps’ investigation of the Katrina disaster.Some can live with thoughtful uncertainty more comfortably than others. Marion LaNasa, a homeowner in Lakeview, said he loves New Orleans and cannot imagine being happy anywhere else. “If you were really smart, would you stay?” he asked. “Probably not. But there’s more to life than assured comfort and no risk.”Ms. Pratcher said she would continue to demand change — and to pray. “I do believe in God,” she said. “He’s the person I’m calling on now to help us, because man isn’t doing it.”The corps has repeatedly urged local residents to come to its community briefings or to look over the flood risk data, available on its Web site at nola risk.usace.army.mil, that provides possible water levels by street address.Mr. LaNasa, who works for Lockheed Martin at the Michoud Assembly Facility east of town, said that when the risk maps were unveiled in June, he and his wife sat at the computer and looked at the likely flooding in their home in Lakeview. He saw it as evidence that the family should stay, but his wife, who is not from New Orleans, was less certain.“She certainly saw a lot of dark colors, which indicates a lot of water, which is distressing to her,” Mr. LaNasa said.What he saw, though, was that the area around their house, close to Lake Pontchartrain, was relatively higher and, potentially, drier. “We’re pressing ahead — I’m not dwelling on the risk,” he said. “My wife is pressing ahead with me, but a little more skeptically.”After climbing the learning curve, he said, “the decision is going to be an emotional decision,” just a more educated one. “Ultimately, you have to go with your gut.”Others seem to be trusting data from a higher authority. On St. Ferdinand Street in the Desire section of the Ninth Ward, Ora M. Singleton, 70, was standing in her still-ruined front yard pulling grass out by the roots. It costs too much to have it mowed, she explained.Ms. Singleton wanted to get rid of the grass until she can move back into the house — a process that looks, from the appearance of the place, as if it may still be a while. She has put on the new roof and installed new windows, but there is still much to be done after the house took on 7.5 feet of water.She is close to the west wall of the navigation canal that the corps acknowledges is lower than the new one on the other side. But she has not been able to go online to look for information. “I don’t have the Internet,” she said.If she had, she might have seen that her home still stands in a spot where waters from a 1-in-100 flood would reach six feet. Other nearby areas could expect to take on eight feet of water.“I love my city,” she said. “I was led by the Lord to come back.”Will she do anything different, then?“This time we’ll not furnish our home with all that nice antique furniture,” she said. Her mailbox was swept away, but she has precariously wired a new one to the rusted fence. The mailbox is white with delicate letters: “Home Sweet Home.”'"
"'07-08-17,'1','In an interview yesterday, Mr. Cuomo called the new rules “a big step in the right direction,” but he added that the commission could have gone further.“I still believe the optimum, the bright-line test, is a total prohibition. That would be the best standard in the country and the easiest to administer,” Mr. Cuomo said. “And if we’ve learned anything, the less ambiguous the better. And if you look at the statement you can see possible areas of controversy.”The attorney general pointed out that officials are now required to pay airfare reimbursements based on charter costs for private planes rather than rates for commercial flights. But, he noted, the rules do not specify a type of chartered plane, creating a potential loophole for lawmakers. A spokesman for the Ethics Commission said that lawmakers would be expected to pay for a comparable charter flight.Ethics Commission rules apply only to members of the executive branch and their staff, though the governor’s office is asked to use these guidelines in approving legislative use of aircraft, as well. (Approval from the executive branch is needed for legislators to use state aircraft.)The new rules also require state officials to report to the governor’s office all activities on the trip. Those reports would be publicly available. The previous rules had never been codified. They had been described to Gov. George E. Pataki’s administration in 1995, and then written in a 2001 press release.Senate Republicans introduced a bill on Aug. 1 that would ban all use of state aircraft for “political purposes.” A spokesman for Mr. Bruno said yesterday that the new rules fell short of true reform.“This is not what people are looking for, which is the bright line that our bill has,” said the spokesman, John E. McArdle. “Our bill is much better.”Republicans have called some members of the commission biased because they were appointed by Mr. Spitzer.A representative for at least one government watchdog group said yesterday that both the new commission rules and the proposed Senate bill were not clear enough.Russ Haven, the legislative counsel for the New York Public Interest Research Group, said that yesterday’s opinion improved on the previous requirements, which he likened to a ""porous Swiss cheese policy.""But Mr. Haven, whose group had formally asked the commission to reconsider its rules, said he would have preferred “if the lines were a little clearer.”He added that the State Senate bill did not fully define “political purposes.”“Does that mean only partisan fund-raising? Does that mean you can’t criticize the governor or you can’t criticize some political figure or you can’t comment on a controversial policy?” Mr. Haven said. “Depending on how you define it, everything is political.”'"
"'07-08-17,'1','MOSCOW, Aug. 16 — A panel of international military experts concluded in a report released Thursday that a missile found in a field in the Republic of Georgia last week fell from an airplane that flew from Russia into Georgia and then returned to Russia.The report, by experts from the United States, Sweden, Latvia and Lithuania, also confirmed that the missile, nearly 16 feet long, was a Russian-made Kh-58, a type designed to destroy NATO radar stations. The report, however, stopped short of directly implicating Russia in the matter.It referred instead only to an “unidentified” aircraft that flew into Georgia over a ridge of the Caucasus Mountains on Aug. 6. Russian officials deny any role in the matter, and have suggested instead that Georgia staged the episode, a theory dismissed by the experts.The unidentified aircraft flew from Russian airspace “into Georgian airspace and back again into Russian airspace three times,” according to the report, intended for distribution to Western governments, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe and the United Nations. “Radar information of the last pass into Georgian airspace (around 14:30) indicates that an object separated from the unidentified aircraft,” and fell to the ground.The missile plowed into the ground near the village of Tsitelubani, about 30 miles from the Georgian capital, Tbilisi, and broke apart but did not explode. No one was injured.'"

"'07-08-17,'1','PARIS, Aug. 16 — Singapore Airlines said Thursday that its first Airbus A380 would be delivered Oct. 15, entering service after a costly two-year delay for the plane, the world’s largest passenger jet.The airline said it would receive the first of its 19 double-decker planes at a ceremony at Airbus headquarters in Toulouse, France, and that Singapore’s pilots would fly it to Singapore Changi Airport within a couple of days of delivery.The plane’s first flight with paying customers will depart Oct. 25, from Singapore to the Sydney Airport, and return the next day. The airline announced last month that tickets for each leg of the flight would be auctioned on eBay, with the proceeds going to charity.The entry of the A380 into regular service will begin on the Sydney-to-Singapore route soon after the first flight, though the airline has not set a date. The airline plans to fly daily round trips to Sydney with the plane, which will replace one of the three Boeing 747s that fly the route now.Singapore Airlines said the plane’s interior would be configured to seat 471 passengers — 15 percent below the 555-seat capacity that Airbus had marketed for a standard three-class design — to devote more space to seats in business class and a new offering of first-class “suites.”'"

"'07-08-17,'1','Although the close-knit nature of the Canadian financial sector played a role, innovation at the T.S.E. has mainly kept competition at a distance.In 1997, it became one of the first major national exchanges to switch completely to electronic trading. Richard Nesbitt, the chief executive of the T.S.E.’s parent, the TSX Group, said the move came about largely because the exchange could not afford to maintain both floor and electronic trading.Whatever the reason, the move eliminated an opening for competitors to start exchanges.Like many exchanges until recently, the T.S.E. had been owned by a partnership of the country’s brokerages. Those partners have been accused of neglecting the operation. In 1999 and 2000, in infamous incidents, high trading volumes overwhelmed the exchange’s computers and froze all trading.In 2001, the brokers that owned the exchange bought a small market that traded mostly junior mining and energy stocks, and then the brokers decided to cash out. The exchange went public in 2002, and most of the old owners sold their holdings.Along with that change came regulatory changes to separate market regulation from the exchange and to open Canada’s markets to competition. Few took the bait.Until now, the T.S.E.’s competition remained indirect for the most part. Canadian companies have a long tradition of offering secondary listings elsewhere, mostly in the United States. The maker of BlackBerry, Research in Motion, is also listed on Nasdaq. Shares in Barrick Gold can be found on the New York Stock Exchange.Domestic competition for the T.S.E. came mostly in niche products like junior stock listings.One leader in that field, the Canadian Trading and Quotation System, which calls itself C.N.Q., is behind Pure Trading.Although the T.S.E. was seen as progressive for its electronic platform, Ian Bandeen, the chief executive of Pure Trading and C.N.Q., said the exchange had gradually created an opening for competitors by letting its trading system become dated.“I can’t see David taking on Goliath on price alone,” Mr. Bandeen said. “But most Canadians hadn’t realized how much trading was being performed on U.S. markets because of what people thought was suboptimal performance by the T.S.E.”Mr. Bandeen speculates that after the shutdowns, the T.S.E. revamped its system to emphasize reliability over speed. But delays created problems for traders who used software to execute their deals at the same time on multiple markets.Mr. Bandeen is not reluctant to make lower prices part of his pitch. He estimates that brokers spend about $120 million a year on fees at the Toronto exchange. The lower costs associated with being a start-up, he said, could allow him to “gladly do everything they’re doing much faster and much better for $15 million, and my shareholders would think they’ve died and gone to heaven.”The TSX Group is not ignoring any of this. This week, it announced that it would reduce its fees, some by 40 percent. By the end of the year, it will start a trading platform that Mr. Nesbitt predicts will eliminate the technical concerns that Pure Trading sees as its opening.Mr. Nesbitt rejects suggestions that his exchange is withering. To make up for the loss of some Canadian giants, the T.S.E. has been chasing foreign companies. By his count, the main Toronto exchange and its junior counterpart have recently acquired 125 listings from the United States, 35 from China and 20 from Australia.Although Mr. Nesbitt said he welcomed competition, he added that he was a little surprised by the system proposed by the banks, which is being called Alpha.“They used to run the exchanges, and they were not comfortable in investing in the necessary technology,” he said of the banks. By contrast, Mr. Nesbitt said, the TSX Group budgets about 55 million Canadian dollars a year for annual upgrades.Michael Sheridan, the president and chief executive of Norstar Securities in Toronto, is among the few in Canada’s financial community who will publicly discuss the new exchange.Although his firm plans to use Pure Trading, Mr. Sheridan is not eager for its arrival.“It’s not really a voluntary thing,” he said of the decision. “The regulators have said that you have to get the best price for a client. If it’s an alternative system, you have to use it. It’s a small market in Canada, so this makes everyone’s life very difficult.”Mr. Sheridan expects Alpha to succeed in part because many large trades currently done on the T.S.E. are arranged in advance by the big banks and institutional investors. When the banks’ system is running, many of those deals will be executed without the T.S.E. middleman.But the success of Pure Trading and other, broad alternative markets may hinge on luring a substantial volume of trades.“It’s going to be difficult for someone to compete in such a small market with the T.S.X., which has such a hold on the market and which spends a lot on technology,” Mr. Sheridan said. “They may just spend the others out of existence.”'"
"'07-08-17,'1','Your article about China’s efforts to eliminate politics from the Olympics and suppress protests about human rights abuses (“Beijing ’08: Let the Politics Begin,” Week in Review, Aug. 12) has a back story, implicating the Bush administration in China’s repressive tactics.Eager to enlist the Chinese in its plans to invade Iraq, the administration sold out the oppressed Muslim people of the Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region in China. In so doing, it created a stateless condition for 18 innocent Uighur men, not charged but imprisoned at Guantánamo since the summer of 2002.To buy China’s acquiescence for the administration’s invasion of Iraq, the United States agreed, among other things, to include fabricated Uighur nationalist groups among its list of terrorist organizations.The United States has since disavowed China’s claim that the Uighurs present a terrorist threat. Nevertheless, that cynical bargain sealed the fate of the 17 Uighurs languishing in Guantánamo’s cages, imprisoned because they cannot be returned to China and the United States cannot find another country willing to take them. And the United States will not take them itself.The writer is a lawyer providing pro bono representation to two Uighur detainees at Guantánamo Bay.'"

"'07-08-17,'1','The way he saw it, the crisis was shaking out his competitors, the ones who had made those imprudent loans. With them gone, he could make more money.Within days, he bought 10,000 shares. The chairman and chief executive, Garrett Thornburg, invested almost $13 million in company stock. Four other insiders, including the chief financial officer, were also buyers.But last week, things got dicey. Thornburg Mortgage owned a lot of AAA-rated mortgage securities, and had borrowed up to 95 percent of their value. Now the lenders, suspecting the securities were worth less, wanted more cash. To get it, Thornburg had to sell securities, and few wanted to buy. Suddenly the commercial paper market, so willing to lend to Thornburg at small margins just weeks before, was not interested in lending even at much higher rates.As for the share price, it went into a free fall on Tuesday, amid rumors that the company could not meet its obligation. Trading was halted with the stock under $8. On Tuesday night, it conceded it was having trouble raising money to finance mortgages. It said the dividend it had promised to pay on Wednesday would be delayed by a month.But it insisted that it was not bankrupt. Even marking down the value of its assets to current market value, it said, it was worth $14.28 a share on Monday, down from $19.38 at the end of June.That provided some reassurance, and since then the shares have climbed back above $12.Thornburg has prospered until now with a fairly simple formula. Organized as a REIT, it paid big dividends representing all of its taxable income. It grew by issuing more shares, which it could sell at prices above its book value because individual investors valued the high yield. The shares wound up in a lot of retirement accounts, and the fact that people paid more than book value enabled the book value per share to grow.The insiders profited hugely from that. The company gets away with not disclosing how much the bosses are paid because it is managed by a separate company owned by some of the bosses. That management company gets incentive fees based on the company’s total book value and profits, a formula that would seem familiar to a hedge fund manager. Effectively, the bosses get a cut every time the company sells new stock, and keep getting cuts from those sales every year.Now Thornburg, like many other companies, needs a quick unfreezing of the credit markets. But even if they get it — if the Fed tells banks to rescue them with emergency loans — many may find that they cannot safely operate with such high leverage. And without the leverage, profits will be harder to make even if Thornburg can charge more for mortgage loans.The unfortunate series of events that got us here — remember the proverb in which a kingdom is lost for want of a nail — began with a weakening housing market. That caused some mortgages to go into default, which raised questions about the value of mortgage securities and the credibility of the ratings that enabled the securities to be sold.That led to the questioning of other types of loans that had been financed by selling packages of securities that were structures in similar ways to ones that had financed the mortgages. It became more difficult for companies to borrow. Now it seems to be spilling over to the real economy, with consumers getting nervous.“We are going through a psychological event,” Mr. Goldstone said. “It has everybody in a panic. There is nothing fundamental here.”He may be wrong about that last part. There may not have been a fundamental change in the health of his business, but such a change is taking place in the credit markets. There, buyers with available cash are few, and many of them are in no hurry to buy when so many need to sell.It is sort of like a game of musical chairs in which the music stops and it turns out that all the chairs have vanished.'"
"'07-08-17,'1','Yet our desire to avoid letting bad actors off the hook shouldn’t prevent us from doing the right thing, both morally and in economic terms, for borrowers who were victims of the bubble.Most of the proposals I’ve seen for dealing with the problems of subprime borrowers are of the locking-the-barn-door-after-the-horse-is-gone variety: they would curb abusive lending practices — which would have been very useful three years ago — but they wouldn’t help much now. What we need at this point is a policy to deal with the consequences of the housing bust.Consider a borrower who can’t meet his or her mortgage payments and is facing foreclosure. In the past, as Gretchen Morgenson recently pointed out in The Times, the bank that made the loan would often have been willing to offer a workout, modifying the loan’s terms to make it affordable, because what the borrower was able to pay would be worth more to the bank than its incurring the costs of foreclosure and trying to resell the home. That would have been especially likely in the face of a depressed housing market.Today, however, the mortgage broker who made the loan is usually, as Ms. Morgenson says, “the first link in a financial merry-go-round.” The mortgage was bundled with others and sold to investment banks, who in turn sliced and diced the claims to produce artificial assets that Moody’s or Standard & Poor’s were willing to classify as AAA. And the result is that there’s nobody to deal with.This looks to me like a clear case for government intervention: there’s a serious market failure, and fixing that failure could greatly help thousands, maybe hundreds of thousands, of Americans. The federal government shouldn’t be providing bailouts, but it should be helping to arrange workouts.And we’ve done this sort of thing before — for third-world countries, not for U.S. citizens. The Latin American debt crisis of the 1980s was brought to an end by so-called Brady deals, in which creditors were corralled into reducing the countries’ debt burdens to manageable levels. Both the debtors, who escaped the shadow of default, and the creditors, who got most of their money, benefited.The mechanics of a domestic version would need a lot of work, from lawyers as well as financial experts. My guess is that it would involve federal agencies buying mortgages — not the securities conjured up from these mortgages, but the original loans — at a steep discount, then renegotiating the terms. But I’m happy to listen to better ideas.The point, however, is that doing nothing isn’t the only alternative to letting the parties who got us into this mess off the hook. Say no to bailouts — but let’s help borrowers work things out.'"

"'07-08-18,'0','“When the game is important, or a need for us, he just responds so well,” Torre said. “He may not win, but he’s always kept things together, and he just pitches tough.”The rookie Joba Chamberlain recorded the last three outs to continue the electric start to his career. The crowd chanted Chamberlain’s first name before he even threw a pitch, taking quickly to a pitcher who has had only four career outings.“There were a lot of people here going crazy,” Chamberlain said. “It makes you feel good. You use that energy to the best. Sometimes you let it the most of you and you try to do too much, but I’ve done a good job of slowing the game down and getting used to the role.”Chamberlain threw 10 pitches — 7 for strikes — and hit 99 miles an hour on the radar gun three times. His second pitch hummed it at 100.Gary Sheffield, who is 0 for 7 in this series, flied to left to lead off the ninth. After a single by Magglio Ordóñez, Chamberlain induced a pop out from Carlos Guillén, then fanned Iván Rodríguez on a slider to end the game. In six scoreless innings, Chamberlain has allowed two hits and struck out nine.Pettitte has a long history of success in the second half. He came into the game with a .708 career winning percentage after the All-Star Game break, second only to Johan Santana among active A.L. pitchers with at least 60 decisions.This year has been no exception. Before last night, Pettitte was 5-1 with a 3.15 earned run average in seven starts since the break. The Tigers scored four runs in the top of the first against Mike Mussina on Thursday, but against Pettitte last night, they went down in order.“I wanted to be aggressive,” said Pettitte, who worked on his mechanics last weekend to keep from opening his lead shoulder too soon. “Maybe that’s something I made a conscious effort to do — come out and be aggressive with the team struggling.”The second hitter, the top prospect Cameron Maybin, was making his major league debut. Pettitte, who said the scouting report on Maybin was that “he likes the heater,” whiffed him with his trademark biting slider. He did so again in the third.That had been an odd inning, starting with a single by Ryan Rayburn that Alex Rodriguez let roll down the third-base line. It hit the bag to stay fair.Brandon Inge followed with a double to the left field corner. Hideki Matsui gathered it and threw to shortstop Derek Jeter, who fired home. It seemed as if the Yankees had a good chance to catch Rayburn, but the throw was off line, Torre said, and first baseman Andy Phillips cut off the throw as Inge charged toward third.Phillips threw there, but Inge scrambled back to second base, where no fielders were waiting. Second baseman Robinson Canó had been backing up Jeter, and right fielder Bobby Abreu did not cover the bag for him.After a walk and Maybin’s second strikeout, up came Sheffield, a favorite target of the fans. Sheffield bounced to Jeter for an inning-ending forceout.The Tigers were leading, 1-0, but the Yankees came right back. Canó and Phillips singled to start the Yankees’ half of the third, and after two outs, Bobby Abreu bounced a bad-hop single over the glove of shortstop Guillén.The break scored Cano to tie the game, and Rodriguez gave the Yankees a 2-1 lead with a ground-rule double to left. Giambi bashed Nate Robertson’s first pitch of the bottom of the fourth into the seats in right center, and he homered again off Aquilino Lopez in the eighth.Giambi has four home runs in his last 18 at-bats, and he is batting .348 (8-for-23) since coming off the disabled list on Aug. 7.“I’m fresh right now, so I’ve got good bat speed,” Giambi said. “I’m just seeing the ball and hitting it well.”'"
"'07-08-18,'0','An audit of the New Jersey Education Department has found that inadequate staffing and resources, organizational problems and a lack of training and communications could hamper its ability to effectively oversee the state’s 615 school districts.The 155-page audit, released yesterday by state education officials, noted the potential for “competing priorities and inconsistent decision making processes” because of a state education system that is overseen by both the Education Department and the State Board of Education, whose 13 members are appointed by the governor and set the state’s education policies.Within the Education Department, the audit suggested that there were not enough staff and resources to handle the increased responsibilities of a new statewide monitoring system for school districts, among other problems. It said that the department’s monitoring efforts were hampered by “a lack of people, processes and technology” and insufficient coordination and communication with employees.The audit recommended a number of steps to address these problems, like restructuring the department’s operations and business processes, and improving communication with employees, including the use of e-mail and an Intranet Web site.In a written statement, Education Commissioner Lucille E.

"'07-08-18,'0','Immigration authorities have received about 300,000 applications for high-skilled-employment visas since July 1, federal officials said yesterday, a deluge unleashed after the federal government first said it would not accept any applications for those visas during July and then reversed course.Citizenship and Immigration Services, the federal agency, was still receiving applications for employment visas yesterday, the last day of a special period it announced on July 17 for immigrants with professional skills to file petitions for permanent residence visas, known as green cards. As a result, the total tally of applications received in the last six weeks was not available.The agency admitted it was swamped by the applications it had already received, which was more than double the annual limit of 140,000 employment visas.According to official figures, in the three months before July the agency received an average of 54,700 applications a month for all green cards, including employment visas and those based on family ties. Applications were already surging then as foreigners sought to file papers before higher processing fees took effect on July 30.“That is a fantastically high number,” said Carl Shusterman, an immigration lawyer in Los Angeles.

"'07-08-18,'0','The fate of the three young men — Mr. Goodman was 20, Mr. Chaney 21, Mr. Schwerner 24 — was widely seen as helping inspire the historic civil rights march from Selma to Montgomery, Ala., in 1965, and the passage of the Voting Rights Act the same year.A slender, elegant woman with sleek short hair, Dr. Goodman remained for decades a highly visible political presence. As she repeatedly made plain, she was not seeking revenge. (To the end of her life, she publicly opposed capital punishment.) She was, rather, agitating to see justice done — not only for her son and his colleagues, but on a wide range of issues.In 1966, Dr. Goodman and her husband, Robert Goodman, started the Andrew Goodman Foundation, which supports a variety of social causes. Over the years, she took a prominent part in antiwar demonstrations, lectured often to student and religious groups and marched in civil rights rallies of all kinds.In a telephone interview yesterday, her son David recounted a characteristic incident, which happened in 1999, during the public protest over the death of Amadou Diallo, the Guinean immigrant shot and killed by New York police officers. A colleague came into Mr. Goodman’s office to tell him that his mother had just been seen on television, being taken off to jail.“I said, ‘Well, that happens from time to time,’ ” Mr. Goodman recalled.Carolyn Elizabeth Drucker was born in Woodmere, N.Y., on Oct. 6, 1915. Her father, Edward, a lawyer, was concerned with social causes: he hired one of the first black lawyers to work in a white New York firm, David Goodman said yesterday. Carolyn earned a bachelor’s degree in home economics from Cornell University in 1936, a master’s in clinical psychology from the City University of New York in 1953 and a doctorate in education from Columbia University Teachers College in 1968.Her political involvement began early: at Cornell, she helped organize local farmers’ cooperatives. In the late 1930s, she served on a committee that aided Spanish Republicans exiled during the Spanish Civil War.After her marriage to Robert W. Goodman, a civil engineer, in the late 1930s, their sprawling, book-lined apartment became a haven for progressive artists and intellectuals. In the 1950s, the Goodmans were deeply involved in the fight against McCarthyism; Alger Hiss was a guest on occasion. They were also avid supporters of the arts, organizing benefits for the New York Philharmonic and other organizations. (One of David Goodman’s childhood memories, he said yesterday, was of hearing a visiting Leonard Bernstein play the family piano.)In this heady environment, the Goodmans’ three sons, Jonathan, Andrew and David, grew up. In 1964, Andrew, then a student at Queens College, told his parents he planned to go to Mississippi.“It wasn’t easy for us,” Dr. Goodman told The New York Times in 2005. “But we couldn’t talk out of both sides of our mouths. So I had to let him go.”As Andrew was about to leave, Dr. Goodman slipped iodine and bandages into his duffel bag, in case he was roughed up in the South. Neither one of them, she said afterward, could conceive of anything much beyond that.In 1967, a federal jury in Meridian, Miss., convicted seven Klansmen of conspiracy in the deaths of the three civil rights workers. None served more than six years. In January 2005, Mr. Killen, who in 1967 was released in one of the federal trials as a result of a hung jury, was arrested and charged with murder by the State of Mississippi.At his trial, Dr. Goodman read a postcard her son wrote on June 21, 1964, the last day of his life.“Dear Mom and Dad,” it read, “I have arrived safely in Meridian, Miss. This is a wonderful town, and the weather is fine. I wish you were here. The people in this city are wonderful, and our reception was very good. All my love, Andy.”Robert Goodman died of a stroke in 1969 at 54; Dr. Goodman’s second husband, Joseph Eisner, whom she married in 1972, died in 1992. She is survived by her sons David, of Upper Saddle River, N.J., and Jonathan, of Tel Aviv; nine grandchildren; and two great-grandchildren.Mr. Chaney’s mother, Fannie Lee Chaney, died in May.

"'07-08-18,'0','LAS VEGAS, Aug. 17 (AP) — The federal government has dismissed slavery charges against three men accused of detaining a troupe of Chinese acrobats and forcing it to perform.The complaint, filed last month, was dismissed on Thursday shortly before the men — You Zhi Li, 38; Yang Shen, 21; and Jun Hu, 43 — were scheduled to appear for a preliminary hearing.Steven W. Myhre, the acting United States attorney for Nevada, said a magistrate judge had initially approved the complaint. “Upon further investigation, however, the United States has determined that it has been unable to develop evidence sufficient to prove those charges beyond a reasonable doubt,” Mr. Myhre told The Las Vegas Review-Journal.A spokesman for the troupe, the China Star Acrobats, referred questions to Mr. Li’s defense lawyer, Gabriel Grasso, who said his client was “very relieved.” The Review-Journal reported last month that Daniel Chau, who identified himself as a partner in China Star Acrobats, said claims of troupe members being held against their will were a ploy by some acrobats seeking to stay in the United States.The interpreter for the group had told the police that she and 20 teammates were crammed into a house in the Las Vegas area that was guarded by the three Chinese men. The complaint accused Mr. Li of confiscating members’ passports and visas and monitoring their phone calls.'"
"'07-08-18,'0','“Japan gets hit by a double whammy,” said Patrick Mohr, a strategist at Citigroup in Tokyo.“With higher risk aversion,” Mr. Mohr said, “you see unwinding of the carry trade, so on top of a lower appetite for equities, that’s compounded by concerns for export earnings.”Analysts have been observing a reversal of carry trades for several weeks now, explaining in part why the dollar has fallen about 10 percent against the yen since June. But the trend appeared to have picked up sharply on Friday.Few of the world’s finance officials will shed any tears at the tapering off of the carry trade, a highly speculative venture that the Group of 7 has tried to discourage, at least rhetorically.But the market volatility created by the unwinding of carry trades, which has rippled through all kinds of assets, is something most people could do without. And it feeds on itself: volatility in exchange rates makes cheap-yen borrowing increasingly risky, necessitating more unwinding.It is unclear why investors were prompted to accelerate their repurchases of yen so suddenly Friday, but analysts said increasing volatility in emerging markets was raising the risks inherent in the carry trade.It has “become a race to reduce risk,” Satoru Asatani, a fund manager at Shinko Investment Trust in Tokyo, told Bloomberg News. “People don’t care about the valuations now, they’re just selling whatever they can.”Ed Merner, manager of the Atlantis Japan Growth Fund in Tokyo, said, “If you’re investing overseas and the yen starts to go against you, or what you’re investing in goes against you, then you start to sell that and maybe the yen gets stronger — that panics people into covering.” .A rising yen makes Japanese exports more expensive for consumers abroad, particularly in the United States, where the widening panic over tightening credit and housing loans is raising concerns that consumer spending may suffer.While much of the carry trade is conducted by hedge funds, analysts say Japanese retail investors are also a big contributor. Overseas stocks and bonds are increasingly popular among investors who have little confidence in their own stock market and economy.And while Japanese retail investors do not necessarily borrow the yen to buy these products, analysts say the effect is much the same. But now, with carry trades being swiftly unwound, the currencies that carry traders were buying have been falling as fast as the yen has been rising.On Friday, the Australian and New Zealand currencies suffered their biggest weekly declines against the United States dollar in at least 18 years. The Australian central bank bought its currency for the first time in six years Friday to stem the steepest one-day drop since it was allowed to trade freely in 1983.However unfavorable global market volatility may have made the carry trade in recent weeks, analysts said, the practice is unlikely to fully disappear as long as Japanese interest rates are so much lower than rates elsewhere.""People can put their carry trade back on two weeks from now,"" said Christophe Lee, the chairman of the Alternative Investment Management Association in Hong Kong. ""Yen interest rates remain very low"" so there’s still room to maneuver, he said.Japanese bank accounts typically pay less than half a percentage point of interest per year. That means that even parking funds in United States dollars is profitable to a Japanese investor, provided that dollar declines do not erase those gains.Returns can be even higher if those yen are invested in places like Australia and New Zealand, where rates are higher and a commodities boom has been pushing up inflation and causing currencies to appreciate.While conventional economic theory holds that lowering interest rates and thereby reducing borrowing costs stimulates economic growth, some in Japan say the reverse may be true. In a nation where the predominantly elderly population keeps most of its money in savings, higher interest rates could increase their disposable income and stimulate consumer spending.'"

"'07-08-18,'0','In the days leading up to Thursday, Mr. Asness’s fund — and most other quant funds — had gotten clobbered. When the AQR flagship fund opened for business on Friday, Aug. 10, it was down 13 percent for August. Mr. Simons’s famed Medallion fund, which has rarely had a down month during nearly two decades of incredible performance, lost 8.7 percent in early August. By mid-August, Goldman Sachs’s flagship Global Alpha fund was down 26 percent for the year. Everywhere you looked in the little town of Quantsville, it was ugly.And then, in the blink of an eye, it turned around, at least for the moment. As of today, Mr. Asness’s fund had gained back half of what it lost in the previous two weeks, and was at break-even for the year. I hear through the grapevine that Mr. Simons has already made back every penny Medallion lost in early August. During its conference call earlier in the week, Goldman announced that it had rounded up $3 billion for one of its battered hedge funds; I’ll bet a steak dinner that that fund has seen some gains this week as well.All of which poses some big questions: What really happened during the Great Quant Meltdown of early August? More to the point, should it scare us or reassure us?Let’s be honest here. You hear the words “quant fund meltdown,” and one firm comes to mind: Long-Term Capital Management.Back in 1998, that now infamous quant fund really did melt down, not only liquidating, but shaking the entire global financial system. Long-Term used complex computer models that failed to anticipate some severe once-in-a-lifetime market events, and it was shockingly leveraged — it was using $100 of borrowed money for every dollar of its own capital — which magnified its losses. It was also run by some of the smartest people on Wall Street. “When Genius Failed” was the apt title to Roger Lowenstein’s fine book about that fiasco.Ever since, whenever quant funds stumble, it’s “When Genius Failed Redux.” Wall Street wags begin to wonder if those losses will lead to something truly cataclysmic, while newspaper reporters take a certain undisguised glee in reporting on really smart people losing money. Even now, there’s enough Luddite schadenfreude in the air that rumors continue to circulate that AQR is continuing to absorb substantial losses — which is the exact opposite of the truth, Mr. Asness says.What is scary in this case is not that the quant funds were the initial source of a ripple effect on the rest of the market; they weren’t. The quant funds were the recipients of a ripple that began in a corner of the market that they had little to do with —namely, the subprime mortgage crisis. It’s the way the subprime contagion shook the quants, whose subsequent downturn then added to the ripple effect, that’s what is nervous-making.Mr. Asness’s hedge fund offers a case in point. Does his fund deal with the subprime business? Not in any significant way. Rather, the securities that cost AQR so much money were good old-fashioned equities.To oversimplify (sorry: you can’t explain this stuff without oversimplifying), AQR’s market neutral funds use computers to sort through a set of complex but common-sensical criteria to identify all sorts of assets — including stocks — that it believes are undervalued but gaining some momentum, which means that both price and fundamentals are improving. It buys, literally, thousands of those stocks. Then it seeks out stocks it believes are overvalued and starting to lose momentum. It shorts those stocks. What makes the fund “market neutral” is that it always tries to have the same amount long as short. Mr. Asness likes to say that it’s not really rocket science but intuitive investing; the computers mainly allow him to do it across thousands of stocks at the same time.Mr. Asness does not suggest that he is going to be on the winning side of every trade. Not even close. Nor does Mr. Asness suggest that his strategy is risk-free. It’s not. “If you don’t take any risk, you won’t make any money,” he said. Even when things are going swimmingly, he’s going to have almost as many losing trades as winning ones. But over time the winning trades will add to better-than-average gains. In a down market, he hopes that his shorts will fall more than his longs, and in an up market, he wants the longs to rise more than the shorts.As for risk, he adds leverage to bolster returns; indeed using borrowed money to calibrate risk is a major part of his strategy. But it’s not crazy stuff like Long-Term Capital Management, and it would be hard to argue with his results over time.What happened in August is something that happens to every investor at times, even Warren E. Buffett: his strategy stopped working. So did Mr. Simons’s strategy and that of all the other quants. Mr. Asness’s trades weren’t just a little off — they were hugely off. The undervalued stocks he was buying were dropping steeply, but he wasn’t getting any help from the short side of his portfolio. Several “quants” I spoke to — market veterans who had been through the 1987 market crash and the 1998 Long-Term Capital disaster — told me they had never seen anything quite like it.Why did it happen? In the immortal words of the market sage, James Grant, “On Wall Street, every good idea is driven into the ground like a tomato stake.” Quant investing, as practiced by the likes of Mr. Asness, Mr. Simons and others, has been enormously successful. And anything that’s successful on Wall Street is invariably going to be copied by others. That is exactly what’s happened in many cases at firms that did other things besides quant investing — like trading in derivatives built around subprime loans.As these subprime instruments have cratered, investors have lost faith not just in them but in other credit derivatives. The holders of these securities had to meet margin calls and make other payments. So they had to start selling more liquid securities like, well, the kind of easily traded securities held in their quant equity portfolios, like Microsoft or I.B.M. or General Electric. And as they sold, other quant shops, like AQR, which held many of the same stocks, saw huge drops instead of small gains. Is it any wonder traders are calling this a contagion?One line making the rounds on Wall Street is that the events of last week show that, just as with Long-Term Capital Management, the quants’ models didn’t work — that bloodless computers simply can’t anticipate events outside the norm. That line drives Mr. Asness bonkers. “In theory, what just happened is impossible, so if we stuck to the theory, we’d be dead,” he said. “We know this stuff happens.” Once they realized the magnitude, he and his partners quickly began a mild “deleveraging” to protect against even bigger losses. Eventually, AQR started buying cheap stock again — which had become even cheaper thanks to the short-term panic.In the view of several big-time quants I spoke to, their big mistake was in not realizing that their little corner of Wall Street had become so crowded with imitators — and that when others were forced to sell, they were going to get hurt. Now they are all trying to figure out how to factor that into their thinking for the future — Mr. Asness very much included. “We have a new risk factor in our world,” he said.So how should the rest of us feel about what just happened? Even though the worst seems to be over, I still think we should still be worried. But not because computer-driven quant funds took a tumble. That’s a symptom, not a cause. The larger issue is the contagion itself — the fact that something so out of left field, like subprime, could wind up hurting the quants.Richard Bookstaber, a former quant manager, has recently written a book, called “A Demon of Our Own Design” (Wiley, 2007), which has become a small sensation on Wall Street. In it, he argues that the proliferation of complex financial products like derivatives, combined with use of leverage to bolster returns, will inevitably mean that there will be a regular stream of market contagions like the one we’re having now — one of which, someday, could be calamitous. To him, last week’s quant crisis is a classic case in point. “I think crises become inevitable when you have a financial structure like ours,” he said. “How deep or how frequent they are, I wouldn’t want to predict.” Well, who would?So yes, it really is a scary world out there. But quants like Mr. Asness aren’t the reason.'"
"'07-08-19,'0','If the world of verbal blunders were the night sky, the Reverend William Archibald Spooner of Oxford University could play the role of the North Star. Spooner, who was born in 1844, was famous for verbal blundering so incorrigible that his exploits have been immortalized in poems and songs and, most enduringly, by lending his name to a type of slip of the tongue he was unusually prone to make. In the spoonerism, sounds from two words are exchanged or reversed, resulting in a phrase that is inappropriate for the setting. For Spooner, these embarrassments ranged from wild to mild. Toasting Queen Victoria at dinner, Spooner said, ""Give three cheers for our queer old dean,"" and he greeted a group of farmers as ""noble tons of soil."" There was the time he cautioned young missionaries against having ""a half-warmed fish in their hearts."" He described Cambridge in the winter as ""a bloody meek place."" Once Spooner berated a student for ""fighting a liar in the quadrangle."" ""You have hissed all my mystery lectures,"" he reportedly said. ""In fact, you have tasted two whole worms and you must leave Oxford this afternoon by the next town drain."" A spoonerism can also involve the reversal of two words, as in ""Courage to blow the bears of life,"" or, when saying good-bye to someone, ""Must you stay, can't you go?""Undergraduates at Oxford University were playfully fond of Spooner, whom they nicknamed ""the Spoo."" They also coined the term ""spoonerism"" around 1885, after Spooner had been a fellow at New College for almost twenty years. By 1892, his reputation for absentmindedness was well known; students came to New College expecting to hear a spoonerism. ""Well, I've been up here for four years, and never heard the Spoo make a spoonerism before, and now he makes a damned rotten one at the last minute,"" wrote one student. (Spooner had assured students that experience would teach them that ""the weight of rages will press harder and harder upon the employer."") Spooner himself knew of his public image. Privately he referred to his ""transpositions of thought."" At the end of a speech he once gave to a group of alumni, he said, ""And now I suppose I'd better sit down, or I might be saying-er-one of those things."" The scientist Julian Huxley (a New College fellow under Spooner for six years), who was present at the scene, said that the audience reacted with ""perhaps the greatest applause he ever got.""The British humor magazine Punch called Spooner ""Oxford's great metaphasiarch."" Spooner's reputation was also carried beyond Oxford and even out of England by newspapers' joke columns, funny pages, and ""quips and quirks"" sections. One example of screwy language from around this time is an 1871 collection by the American writer C. C. Bombaugh, titled The Book of Blunders. Though it didn't mention Spooner, Bombaugh's book promised a grab bag anthology of ""Hibernicisms, bulls that are not Irish and typographic errors."" In addition to slips of the printing press, Bombaugh included slips of the telegraph. A French cleric was once greeted at the train station by a funeral bier-intended for him-because the telegraph operator had mistaken PËre Ligier et moi (Father Ligier and I) for PËre Ligier est mort (Father Ligier is dead). One New Yorker ordered flowers from a florist in Philadelphia, telegraphing a need for ""two hand bouquets,"" which the telegraph clerk printed as ""two hund. bouquets."" When the New Yorker refused to pay for 198 unwanted bouquets, the florist sued him and lost. Then the florist sued the telegraph company and (according to Bombaugh) won. Such were the legal liabilities of a verbal blunder. On the face of it, slurs against the Irish and accidents of typography seem to have little in common. Yet the opportunity to mock and laugh about either one neutralized the perceived threats of immigrants and technological change.The public's taste for outrageous jabberwocky may have predated Spooner, but his sayings appeared so frequently and widely that the spoonerism was known around the English-speaking world early in the twentieth century. On a visit to South Africa in 1912, Spooner said in a letter to his wife that ""the Johannesburg paper had an article on my visit to Johannesburg, but of course they thought me most famous for my Spoonerisms, so I was not greatly puffed up."" In the 1920s, Spooner encountered an American woman at a concert who asked if he was Dr. Spooner. As Spooner wrote in his diary, ""She replied I was the best known name in America except Mr. Hudson Shaw [sic] ... to have known a celebrity, even the author of 'Spoonerisms' means a good deal, tho' I explained to her that I was better known for my defects than for any merits.""In all, Spooner spent almost sixty years as a member of New College, starting as a student in 1862, then as a fellow in 1867. To get the position, he had to take an oral exam, which he not only passed but excelled at. He ascended the ranks until he became warden, a sort of chaplain, from 1903 to 1924. He was married, had seven children, and lived in a sixteen-bedroom mansion staffed with eleven servants. When he was fifty-two years old, he tried to learn to ride a bicycle. (Or ""a well-boiled icicle,"" as he put it.) He was also a revered classics scholar and a respected school leader. He had a rare gift, said Huxley, ""of making people feel that he was deeply interested in their own particular affairs."" As an albino (""not a full albino with pink eyes,"" Huxley remembered, ""but one with very pale blue eyes and white hair just tinged with straw color""), Spooner had horrifically poor eyesight and could read only with his eyes several inches from the page. He also spoke with a squeaky, high-pitched voice and said ""uh"" a lot-perhaps because he was trying to avoid making the slips he'd become famous for.'"

"'07-08-19,'0','In December, the first subprime lenders started failing as more borrowers began falling behind on payments, often shortly after they received the loans. And in February, HSBC, the large British bank, set aside $1.76 billion because of problems in its American subprime lending business.Over the last two weeks, this slowly building wave became a tsunami in the global financial markets.On Friday, the Federal Reserve was forced into a surprise cut of the discount rate it charges banks to borrow money, a move that steadied shaky stock and credit markets and reassured investors, bankers and traders who were reeling from a month of market turmoil. And for the first time, the Fed bluntly acknowledged that the credit crisis posed a threat to economic growth.“Until recently, there was a lot of denial, but this is a big deal,” said Byron R. Wien, a 40-year veteran of Wall Street who is now chief investment strategist at Pequot Capital. “Now the big question is: Will this spill over into the broader economy?”The answer to that question will be revealed over the coming months. But the cast of characters who missed signals like the rise of delinquencies and foreclosures is becoming easier to identify. They include investment banks happy to sell risky but lucrative mortgage debt to hedge funds hungry for high interest payments, bond rating agencies willing to hope for the best in the housing market and provide sterling credit appraisals to debt issuers, and subprime mortgage brokers addicted to high sales volumes.What is more, some of these players now find themselves in a dual role as both enabler and victim, like the legions of individual borrowers who were convinced that their homes could only keep rising in value and were confident that they could afford to stretch for the biggest mortgage possible.“All of the old-timers knew that subprime mortgages were what we called neutron loans — they killed the people and left the houses,” said Louis S. Barnes, 58, a partner at Boulder West, a mortgage banking firm in Lafayette, Colo. “The deals made in 2005 and 2006 were going to run into trouble because the credit pendulum at the time was stuck at easy.”Oddly, the credit analysts at brokerage firms now being pummeled were among the Cassandras whose warnings were not heeded. “I’m one guy in a research department, but many people in our mortgage team have been suggesting that there was froth within the market,” said Jack Malvey, the chief global fixed income strategist for Lehman Brothers. “This has really been progressing for quite some time.”Others on Wall Street echoed Mr. Malvey’s stance. “We’ve contended for a while that there was an issue in subprime debt,” said Neal Shear, global head of trading at Morgan Stanley. “A year ago, we were aware that delinquencies were going to rise.”So why did many of the smartest minds on Wall Street somehow miss the signposts that these insiders now claim to have seen coming?Few professionals on the losing end of these trades are willing to talk publicly about how what started out as a crisis in an obscure corner of the credit market — subprime debt, for borrowers with weak credit — managed to infect stocks and bonds. For example, officials at Goldman Sachs, Wall Street’s most dominant firm, have provided little detail into how one of their hedge funds lost 30 percent of its value in just weeks.But the precipitous fall in the value of mortgage-backed bonds was spurred by a mad rush by so many holders to dump them simultaneously. That is because they might not have understood what they were buying in the first place, instead focusing only on the bonds’ higher yields. Unlike Mr. Melcher, they had not considered the circumstances under which the risky mortgages they essentially owned had been granted.“Buyers didn’t fully understand what they were getting,” said Rajiv Sobti, a portfolio manager at Proxima Alfa Investments, a New York hedge fund. In Wall Street parlance, Mr. Sobti added, “They were sold, not bought. The actual buyers were often not mortgage specialists, but generalists who looked at these bonds as a way of earning higher yields.”Once the mortgage-backed bonds finally started plunging for the very reasons Mr. Melcher spotted long before, the dominoes moved swiftly. Hedge funds and other holders of this risky debt also began to sell more solid investments like corporate bonds and even stocks in an effort to raise money. These hedge funds, in turn, were under pressure from their own backers to return their investments. The same was true for the Wall Street brokerage houses that had provided them with credit.The blame game is already beginning. The spotlight will focus first on rating agencies like Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s, because the mortgage-backed bonds that plunged in value in recent weeks were highly rated by these agencies until they downgraded billions worth of them in July.Other companies face far more immediate problems. Countrywide Financial, the nation’s largest independent mortgage lender, found itself fending off reports this month that bankruptcy could be looming as its stock plunged 41 percent.Yet as recently as March, Angelo R. Mozilo, the chief executive of Countrywide, appeared on CNBC and proclaimed that worries about the subprime sector were “clearly an overreaction.” He promised that “this will be great for Countrywide at the end of the day, because all the irrational competitors will be gone.”Along with chief executives like Mr. Mozilo, central bankers also apparently failed to anticipate the threat posed by subprime debt. In a May 17 speech in Chicago, Ben S. Bernanke, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, acknowledged the “recent sharp increases in subprime mortgage loan delinquencies.”But he said, “we do not expect significant spillovers from the subprime market to the rest of the economy or to the financial system.”That same month, a former Federal Reserve governor, Edward M. Gramlich, was preparing to publish a book titled, “Subprime Mortgages: America’s Latest Boom and Bust.” Even earlier, in April, the usually bullish National Association of Realtors said that home prices across the country would decline in 2007 because of the widening fallout from subprime loans. And in March, the head of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, a banking regulator, had urged Congress to create standards to protect borrowers with poor credit.Federal regulators did eventually tighten lending standards on June 29, but by then the meltdown on Wall Street was already in progress. Exactly one week earlier, Bear Stearns disclosed that two hedge funds specializing in subprime debt run by its asset management arm were facing a sudden wave of withdrawals by investors, the hedge-fund equivalent of a run on the bank.“This was the match that lit a very dry field of risk on fire,” Mr. Malvey said. When he first heard the news coming out of Bear Stearns, Mr. Malvey recalled, he was busy writing his weekly report to clients in his corner office on the 15th floor of Lehman’s Midtown Manhattan headquarters. Now it seemed as if the broader market was catching up to what Mr. Malvey and his team had been talking about all along.Bear Stearns’ failure to sense the early tremors was especially glaring. In 2006, it was rated as the best risk manager among United States brokerage firms in 2006 by Euromoney, a respected trade publication. Unlike other firms, though, Bear’s problems eventually claimed a high-profile casualty — in early August, the brokerage firm’s co-president and heir apparent, Warren J. Spector, was forced to resign.The company has emphasized that in spite of the damage to its reputation, its actual financial losses were relatively small.Within weeks after the Bear Stearns disclosure, the action shifted to the rating agencies. On July 10, Standard & Poor’s announced it was downgrading $7.3 billion worth of securities sold in late 2005 and 2006, and the ensuing conference call quickly turned testy. Steven Eisman, a portfolio manager at Front Point Partners, an investment firm that had made a major bet against the subprime mortgage market, did not mince words.“I’d like to know why now?” Mr. Eisman demanded to know. “Why didn’t you do this many, many months ago?”The European Union says it plans to examine the agencies’ role in the debacle and investigate possible conflicts of interest between the agencies and the issuers of mortgage bonds.In Washington, Representative Barney Frank, the chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, is planning hearings in October that will also examine this issue. “The fact is the rating agencies didn’t do a very good job,” Mr. Frank said. “They had no way of knowing whether some of the loans were imprudently granted.”In a written statement, Chris Atkins, a spokesman for Standard & Poor’s, said that for 18 months leading up to July 10 the company had been adjusting its assumptions about the housing market, downgrading selected bonds and publicly highlighting potential problems. Even in light of the crisis, S.& P. expects that only the riskiest mortgage bonds could default and that holders of securities with its top AAA rating will continue to receive interest and principal payments.“Our concerns and actions have coincided with the worst housing recession in recent history set against a backdrop of loosened lending practices,” Mr. Atkins said. Still, Mr. Atkins seemed to acknowledge that his company was also caught by surprise.“The market continues to deteriorate, with the level of loss continuing to exceed historical precedents and our initial expectations,” he said.Some mortgage executives take a different view. Larry A. Goldstone, president of Thornburg Mortgage, said the trajectory of the current crisis in subprime closely resembled the arc of past mortgage crunches. Thornburg is not a subprime issuer, but like Countrywide it was also hit with rumors that it could go under last week.“I’ve been in this business since 1983, and this is the fourth time we’ve had this in subprime,” said Mr. Goldstone, ticking off similar squeezes in 1987, 1993 and 1998. Maybe so, but what is different now is how much bigger the subprime market is than in the past, totaling $600 billion last year, up from $120 billion in 2001, according to Inside Mortgage Finance, a trade journal.To make matters worse, all borrowers are now likely to face higher borrowing costs for years to come, even those with stellar credit histories. Already, mortgages of more than $417,000, known as jumbos, carry interest rates of 7.5 percent to 8 percent, up from 6.5 percent last month.“It’s going to come down a little, but it won’t go back to 6.5 percent,” Mr. Goldstone said. He also predicts the rate of about 6.25 percent on smaller government-backed mortgages will probably rise to 7 percent. That may not sound like much, but for a homebuyer borrowing $400,000, the higher rate means $200 more in monthly payments.There are signs that this added burden is already having an effect on the economy. Last week, the nation’s two largest retailers — Wal-Mart and Home Depot — stoked those fears when they reported disappointing earnings and warned that consumer spending was slowing as a result of the weakness in the housing sector. New car purchases have also been slipping, and earlier this month General Motors and Ford lowered their sales forecasts for 2007.Although Mr. Malvey believes the short-term turmoil in the stock and bond markets will subside by the fall, he said the added financial strain on homebuyers increases the odds of a recession in 2008 or 2009. That, in turn, makes it more likely that the Federal Reserve will announce a cut in its benchmark rate when it next meets on Sept. 18, Mr. Malvey said.And while the Fed’s rate cut on Friday will help stabilize the overall credit and equity markets in the near term, it will take months for the benefits to filter down to individual borrowers.“This will have no effect on local market conditions,” Mr. Barnes said. “While smaller government-backed loans and mortgages for extremely high-quality borrowers are available, everything else is very hard to get it.” As for no-money-down loans, he said, rates now stand at 10 percent, in the unlikely event that they can be found.In the coming months, foreclosures are expected to keep mounting.What is more, the interest rates on the subprime mortgages offered to homebuyers in 2005 and 2006, when credit standards were at their most lax, will soon begin to rise, forcing up monthly payments for the weakest borrowers practically overnight. As a result, Mr. Goldstone predicts that banks and other lenders could eventually see losses reach into the tens of billions.Now, some would-be buyers like Matthew Hennig are having to put off their dream of homeownership. In early July, Mr. Hennig, an air-conditioner repairman, signed the contract to buy his ideal home, a two-bedroom condo overlooking a swimming pool in a Phoenix suburb.A day later, however, as he was on the job in a sweltering attic, his loan officer at Fairway Independent Mortgage called to tell him that the $185,000, no-money-down loan Mr. Hennig thought was a sure thing had been denied. Why? He was a first-time buyer with little credit history.Unlike the professionals on the trading floors of Wall Street who lost billions and now seem shell-shocked, Mr. Hennig has moved on. Mr. Hennig, who earns about $40,000 a year, is now renting a room from a friend and saving up the money for a down payment when he tries to buy again in a year or so. He has also recently opened a charge-card account to bolster his credit score.If Mr. Hennig does eventually get a mortgage, however, his monthly payment could well be higher, because of the same factors Mr. Melcher first noticed long ago. “This is the first time I have ever tried to buy anything,” he said. “It is just my luck.”'"
"'07-08-19,'0','The Milbanks were one of the old families of Greenwich, Conn., and their practical, unostentatious approach to politics recalls the solid Republican tradition embodied by Senator Prescott Bush, father of former President George H. W. Bush. Mr. Milbank was as apt to get involved in state politics as he was to weigh in on national questions.Part of the family’s wealth came from the investment of Mr. Milbank’s great-grandfather — the first Jeremiah and the first Milbank to settle in Greenwich — in the new concept of condensed milk, which led to what is now Borden Inc.The first Jeremiah (for whom Milbank Avenue in Greenwich was named) called his son Joseph, and Joseph, in turn, named his son Jeremiah. Jeremiah Jr., who was named after this second Jeremiah, moved from Greenwich around 2000, first to Rye, N.Y., and then to Charlottesville.Jeremiah Jr.’s father commuted between Greenwich and Manhattan on his 75-foot cruiser, which had a salon paneled in English pine. The family’s lifestyle included the best schools, debutante balls and charity galas, but the Milbanks were seldom purposefully in the news.Fortune magazine described the Milbank clan as “one of the oldest, richest, most proper and least publicized families of the American business community.”Jeremiah Milbank Jr. was born in Manhattan on March 24, 1920. He graduated from Yale and Harvard Business School, and served in the Naval Reserve in the Pacific during World War II. He then realized that “the best thing that could happen to me would be to work with my dad,” according to an interview in Greenwich Time in 1991.He joined the International Center for the Disabled, which his father founded in 1917 as one of the first facilities anywhere to help rehabilitate people and reintegrate them into society.It first helped soldiers wounded in World War I and estimates that it has since aided several million people.The younger Jeremiah, who followed the family tradition of a career in investing, began to attend board meetings and found he liked philanthropy and had an aptitude for it. He became president of the center.In 1985, the family split its philanthropy into two foundations.The older JM Foundation gives to conservative causes, although Greenwich magazine in 1995 suggested that some programs, like the one for disadvantaged youth, might startle conservatives. Mr. Milbank also fought for passage of the Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990, which conservatives tended to oppose.The other foundation, the Milbank Foundation for Rehabilitation, gives to groups concerned with disabilities and medical research, among other things. Each dispenses about $1 million a year.Mr. Milbank’s own career in private enterprise included the chairmanship of the Commercial Solvents Corporation, a diversified chemical company, and a seat on the board of Chase Manhattan Bank.Mr. Milbank was married four times. His first wife, the former Andrea Hunter, died in 1982 after 35 years of marriage. A brief marriage to Carolyn Amory ended in divorce. His marriage to Rose Jackson Sheppard ended after seven years with her death in 1998.He is survived by his fourth wife, the former Mary Gillett Rockefeller; and by the children from his first marriage: two sons, Jeremiah III, of Manhattan, who is president of the two family foundations, and Joseph H., of Charlottesville; two daughters, Victoria Whitney of Brookline, Mass., and Elizabeth Archer, who lives near Boston; and 10 grandchildren.Mr. Milbank told Greenwich magazine that his priorities were “the underprivileged young and the disabled.” At an opera benefit, the magazine said, he told the opera lovers that his pet concerns trumped theirs.“If we don’t heal the young walking wounded in our society, the audiences for the opera may be a bit thin,” he said.'"
"'07-08-19,'0','The recent article demonstrates some of the pitfalls. I think it had avoidable problems that helped lead to the eruption of criticism, a view vehemently disputed by Bill Keller, executive editor of The Times, and Michael Gordon, who wrote the piece.Readers said that, at a time of growing tensions between the United States and Iran, the article failed to offer persuasive evidence that Iran was the source of the bombs, known as explosively formed penetrators, E.F.P.’s, which can go through the armor of Humvees.In fact, strong evidence was provided in a 2,600-word article by Gordon and Scott Shane, published March 27, and Gordon said, “I do sort of assume that readers will have some familiarity with the body of our coverage over the past few months.” I don’t think that’s a reasonable assumption, and I believe The Times could have found a way to remind skeptics of the essentials in the March article without repeating it in its entirety.This is a chronic issue that The Times and all newspapers face: How much can reporters and editors assume readers know? If it’s about Paris Hilton, maybe a lot. But if it’s about a large, complicated and politically charged story like Iran, readers need constant help with history and context — even the highly educated, elite audience of The Times.Twelve paragraphs into the latest article, for example, readers were told that “some critics of Bush administration policy” accuse the administration of exaggerating Iran’s role to divert attention from its own mistakes. But if you wanted to know who those critics were and what they had to say, you would have had to revisit the March article, and you had no way, short of a phenomenally retentive memory, to know that.Complicating matters, I found the central point of the latest Iran article elusive. When I started asking editors about it, they first brought up the fifth, sixth and seventh paragraphs, which said that while the American military has been focused on operations against Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia, a Sunni group, the increase in the use of E.F.P.’s was powerful evidence that Shiite militias remain a major long-term worry. The article said that Shiite militants carried out 73 percent of the attacks that killed or wounded American troops in July.That is a striking number, which begged further exploration. After all, much of The Times’s recent coverage from Iraq had been stressing those American operations against Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia. How does that military focus square with the 73 percent number? Shiite militias would appear to be an immediate worry, not just a long-term one.When I talked with Gordon about the article, his first point was that the increased use of E.F.P.’s was militarily significant, and it was important to tell readers what kind of weapon is killing and injuring Americans, regardless of where the weapon comes from. He said he regarded the article as a follow-up to the story in March, when attacks with E.F.P.’s supplied by Iran had been declining. And he said it was important to report the evidence of increased Shiite militant activity.Sorting through all of it, the article would have been clearer to me if it had started something like this: Shiite militants using E.F.P.’s supplied by Iran are launching a huge majority of the attacks that kill and wound Americans in Baghdad, a surprise given recent American military emphasis on combating the Sunni Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia and powerful new evidence of how difficult a military predicament the United States faces in Iraq, where it must confront challenges from multiple directions at once.Lacking a better focus, I believe the article was overplayed on Page 1. Keller said the play was a “slam dunk” to him because it portrayed “an interesting trend over several months in the use of lethal weapons against our troops” and “helps you understand the complexity of the threat” in Iraq.In the article, Odierno was quoted as saying that Iran was “surging” its support of Iraqi militants to influence the Congressional debate on whether to withdraw American troops. There is no indication in the article that he was pressed for the basis of the statement, as I think he should have been. Gordon said that Odierno’s remark was “informed speculation” useful for readers to know.Most of the e-mail assailing this story attacked Gordon personally. I was astonished at the meanness of some of it and reminded anew of how debased so much of what passes for political discourse has become. Gordon figured in coverage leading up to the war in Iraq that The Times itself found to be flawed, but he was not alone, and he has a long record as a military correspondent that includes many triumphs. He is the author of two highly regarded books, on the first gulf war and the current war in Iraq.I found fault with this article, but I know that Gordon has provided excellent coverage on Iran, like the March piece with Shane.Last Sunday, David Rohde and David Sanger wrote an impressive Page 1 article on “How the ‘Good War’ in Afghanistan Went Bad.” The result of months of intensive research, with major sources on the record, including the last three U.S. ambassadors to Afghanistan and an American ground commander, the article chronicled how miscalculations and a shift in focus to Iraq allowed the once-defeated Taliban to regroup and gain strength.This is the kind of story I hope The Times is pursuing relentlessly on all fronts about Iran — looking now at who is making what decisions based on what information. Admittedly, it’s a much harder story to get, but it might help prevent the need for the next what-went-wrong story.'"
"'07-08-19,'0','How quickly the sense of urgency flags. Even as Hurricane Dean heads toward the Gulf Coast, New Orleans is frighteningly far from being prepared to withstand a storm with even a fraction of Katrina’s power.As John Schwartz reported in The Times on Friday, New Orleans is still a city very much at risk. The task of rebuilding its rickety system of levees has proved hugely difficult, while the government’s efforts have been far less than what was promised and what is needed.The Army Corps of Engineers has taken a piecemeal, disorganized approach to the reconstruction of the city’s defenses. It built up a defensive floodwall on the east side of the Industrial Canal — to protect the largely abandoned Lower Ninth Ward — while leaving the more heavily populated Gentilly neighborhood on the west side exposed behind a lower wall. Other projects — in particular, floodgates erected in relative haste to protect more prosperous neighborhoods — have raised charges that the corps is more concerned about the rich.And though most of the task remains to be done, the corps seems to have lost its sense of urgency. The Mississippi River Gulf Outlet, which experts say funneled floodwater into the city, has not been closed off. The corps says it is waiting for proposals from contractors to do the job, which might not be finished for years.The corps says it aims to build up a defense system able to withstand a 1-in-100 storm by 2011. But that is still four years, and four hurricane seasons, away. Moreover, it will require more money from Congress: the plan is likely to cost about double the more than $7 billion that has been appropriated so far. But many members of Congress seem to have lost their enthusiasm.Tens of thousands of battered residents who abandoned homes and lives are not going to return until they can be assured that they will be safe, while the people who stayed are still at risk. Two years after Katrina, that is shameful — and not what President Bush, Congress and the corps promised.'"
"'07-08-19,'0','“It is amazing how quickly people forget,” said Robin Greenwood, an economist at the Harvard Business School, who has studied investor behavior during the late-1990’s boom.One explanation is that many investors tend to have selective memories. They may have been burned in the stock market, but they view real estate as something altogether different, governed by its own laws of nature.“From 40,000 feet, it looks like an investment world gone crazy in both cases,” said Susan M. Wachter, a professor at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, who has written about the dangers of aggressive lending practices in real estate. “But closer in, it’s a different part of the forest.”To be sure, it is easy to think of houses as having little in common with tech stocks.Wall Street analysts were making up new metrics late last decade for valuing dot-com companies, based on “eyeballs” and “first-mover advantage,” and ignoring many traditional measures (like profits). When shares started to fall, there was not much to underpin their value.But what could be a more solid investment — literally and figuratively — than real estate? It was the perfect antidote to dot-com stocks. As a result, the popping of one bubble may have helped lay the groundwork for another.Besides, home ownership has long been seen as a worthy goal in its own right. “Owning a home lies at the heart of the American dream,” President Bush has said. “It serves as the foundation of many Americans’ financial security.”Lenders created an array of mortgages to get people into homes for the first time with modest initial payments. With interest rates so low, there seemed little reason for people to hold back.House prices had been rising since pretty much forever, people were told, and they were rising faster now. The median house price more than doubled from 1993 to 2005, in nominal terms, while incomes rose just 49 percent. Only some of the increase in home prices could be attributed to falling interest rates and population growth.Real estate became an easy ticket to a nationwide party where people seemed to be making life-changing money, spending their downtime watching real estate show like “Flip This House,” surfing Web sites like condoflip.com and reading books like “Are You Missing the Real Estate Boom?” by David Lereah, chief economist for the National Association of Realtors.And the real estate boom was a far more inclusive party than the tech-stock bubble. People then needed to have the money to buy the stocks that, with luck, would rocket to the moon, or work at a hot company that was doling out stock options to employees.Everyone else could only press their noses to glass, watching with envy.But with real estate, homeowners needed to do little more than think about the soaring value of an asset they already owned. People who had been renting, meanwhile, could easily take the monthly check they had been sending to their landlord and turn it into a mortgage payment. A down payment wasn’t always necessary.Many mortgages had artificially low initial payments. The only worry was the spring-loaded trap of a higher reset rate, but that was a problem for another day.The back-of-the-envelope math worked for many homebuyers — first-timers and speculators alike — as long as home prices kept rising quickly. Veteran home buyers went to condo parties, selling properties many times over before they had even been built.The wizardry of financial institutions to bundle mortgages and sell them to investors now is seen by many as a regrettable development. But for years, such strategies were viewed as a way to help achieve the laudable goal of boosting home-ownership levels in this country.“I envision a time when the credit market will bend to suit the needs of home buyers and homeowners, not the other way around,” Franklin D. Raines, the former chief of Fannie Mae, wrote in 1998, adding that “we must embark on a new era for mortgage finance.”The new era arrived, but has turned into a nightmare for many — not just homeowners who are facing foreclosure, but also for investors around the globe who are discovering their pools of investments are filled with sharks.Investors are optimists by nature. (Even those who bet that stocks will fall are optimistic about their bets.) And talk of new economies and new paradigms, driven by technological innovation, are hard to resist.All it really takes are a few data points trending in the right direction — 1,2,3 and on to infinity — to stoke the fires, said James L. Koch, a management professor and director of the Center for Science, Technology and Society at Santa Clara University.“One can extrapolate the rate of appreciation into the future, and therefore, in a sense, feel you aren’t taking a lot of risk,” he said. If only optimism could eliminate risk.In true form, there is an optimistic, long-term view of the current mess: all the innovations in mortgage finance will be recalibrated in a way that takes fuller account of risk, rather than trying to hide the joker in a deck of cards.'"
"'07-08-19,'0','“I’m extremely proud of him for what he’s done over the last month or two,” Scott Lilley, a 28-year-old airman, said during a telephone interview Thursday, his speech still affected by the injury.The team is undefeated in the 18 games it took to earn a spot in the competition that runs through Aug. 26. Along the way, the All-Stars have outscored their opponents by 326-12, including a 6-0 win in the Southwest Regional final over a team from Roswell, N.M.Teams from Houston have twice won the World Series, in 1950 and 1966, according to the event’s media guide. Texas teams have lost in the championship game five times, according to the guide.Few things could keep Scott Lilley from watching his nephew in person, said Matt Lilley, the airman’s brother and Brock’s father.“He would love it more than anything,” he said. “But, obviously, it’s just not going to be possible at this time.”Scott Lilley’s parents, Frank and Jolene Lilley, planned to go to the Lubbock team’s first game last night. After that, though, father and sons will be glued to the TV.“We’ll be coaching from the hospital room,” Frank Lilley, the airman’s father, said. “We’re not going to miss any of them.”For a time, Scott Lilley’s recovery seemed improbable. Shortly after shrapnel ripped into his brain as he was returning from a training mission, he had an aneurysm.Surgeons on Tuesday successfully fitted a plastic prosthetic over the opening in Scott Lilley’s skull, the parts which medics removed to relieve brain swelling after he was hit April 15.Though only 12, Brock seems to understand the severity of his uncle’s wound.“Brock knew exactly what we were facing,” Matt Lilley said. “Initially, it was a matter of life and death. Brock really understood the significance of that.”Throughout Scott Lilley’s recovery, players, their parents and their coaches have sent e-mail messages to the family.That, Matt Lilley said, “is just as big” as the team’s success this year.Though Brock’s thoughts never stray far from his uncle, his focus during the series will be baseball.“It’s real hard to distract these kids,” Thorne said. “He knows that that is beyond his control. He knows whose hands it’s in.”'"

Traders and bankers need to be focused and aggressive. These are all the traits you need to be a good boxer.”The event, set for Nov. 1, was announced last week at the New York Mercantile Exchange, where Wall Street pugilists gathered to ring the closing bell alongside Marc V. Shaw, a former New York deputy mayor and now an Extell executive vice president.More than 100 men — no women — answered an e-mail blast inviting them to participate, Ms. Haas said. Of those, 24 were tapped to train at the Trinity Boxing Club, one of Wall Street’s oldest gyms. Leading up to the match, there will be weigh-ins and fund-raisers at Extell buildings and offices.The boxing pundit Bert Sugar is host for the main event, which is being staged by Trader Monthly and Dealmaker magazines, where Extell is an advertiser.Prize money will go to charities, including Tuesday’s Children, which helps people who lost loved ones in the 9/11 terrorist attacks, and Say Yes to Education, which helps pay for college tuition.Six months after fight night, if a boxer shows that he brought in a condo buyer, Extell will double its charity contribution, Ms. Haas said.

"'07-08-19,'0','Where are equity investors most vulnerable? Financial planners and market strategists point to at least three basic areas:SMALL-COMPANY STOCKS At the start of 2000, the typical retirement investor held $1 in small-capitalization stocks for every $16 invested in large, blue-chip shares, according to Hewitt Associates, the employee benefit research firm in Lincolnshire, Ill. But by July this year, that ratio had shrunk to just 1 to 3.6, as investors chased hot-performing small-cap stocks — and as those shares grew faster than the broader market.This portfolio allocation may be putting investors in a precarious position. “The sword cuts both ways,” said Greg Schultz, a principal at Asset Allocation Advisors, a financial planning firm in Walnut Creek, Calif. Though small-cap stocks tend to climb faster than blue chips in a market upswing, they also tend to lose ground more quickly in a market downturn.Indeed, since the start of July, large stocks, as measured by the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index, have fallen 3.8 percent while small stocks in the Russell 2000 have lost 5.7 percent.And there’s another reason to fear overexposure to small stocks: many savings institutions — those traditionally classified as savings and loans — are small-cap companies, and many of them have been buffeted by the mortgage debacle. In fact, a recent analysis by Morningstar showed that while 67 percent of large-cap stock funds have some exposure to these savings institutions, 88 percent of small-cap funds are so exposed. And this financial industry group has been among the worst-performing so far this year, down nearly 18 percent, on average.FINANCIAL SECTOR STOCKS No sector of the economy is more vulnerable to the current mortgage crisis than the financial services industry. And no sector accounts for a larger slice of the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index. At the end of last year, financial companies represented a record 22.3 percent of the S.& P. 500. That was up from 7.5 percent at the end of 1990.To be sure, there was never a bubble in this sector, as there was in technology in the late 1990s. Indeed, financial stocks in the S.& P. 500 now trade at a lower price-to-earnings ratio than the broad market. That was certainly not the case for tech in 1999.But there is still a potential problem, if only because the sector represents such a wide swath of the market. If your domestic stock portfolio mimics the broad market, more than one-fifth of your holdings are in this sector just as this credit crisis is unfolding.“I think it’s going to be guilt by association,” said Christopher Orndorff, head of equity strategy at Payden & Rygel, an asset manager in Los Angeles. “Financial firms will be presumed guilty” when it comes to their exposure to the subprime crisis until they prove themselves innocent, he said.Mr. Orndorff added: “This is no time to go bargain-hunting in financials.”EMERGING-MARKET STOCKS Despite its lack of exposure to the domestic mortgage crisis, the average diversified emerging-market stock fund has lost 16.4 percent of its value over the past month. That’s more than the average financial sector fund has lost.That is to be expected, said James A. Shambo, a financial planner in Colorado Springs. “Some folks will flee risk in general because they don’t understand what’s going on.”Mr. Shambo says he’s not sure that the credit crunch means the end of investors’ five-year love affair with emerging-market stocks. But eventually, he said, the performance of emerging-market stocks will slow and return to historical norms. And when that happens, the “emerging markets will be affected in their own right.”Though emerging-market stock funds have produced enviable annualized gains of nearly 28 percent over the past five years, investors forget that these same funds lost money in five of the six years from 1997 to 2002.Now, the average investor in a 401(k) retirement plan holds only 1.3 percent of his or her assets in emerging-market equities. “But the average can be very deceptive,” said Pamela Hess, Hewitt’s director of retirement research.Of those 401(k) participants who invested any of their money in the emerging markets, Ms. Hess noted, the typical allocation is 16.4 percent, according to a study Hewitt conducted last year.In many cases, investors may have started with a much more modest exposure to emerging markets, she said. But by failing to rebalance their accounts in recent years, some investors allowed their allocations to this and other risky asset classes to explode.The concern is now this: Will those risky assets blow up investors’ portfolios now that the market has a new-found aversion to risk?'"
"'07-08-19,'0','More Highways? Let’s Think AgainIn “Highways to Help” (Op-Ed, Aug. 5), Sam Staley urges that we build a huge number of new highway lanes for non-New York City commuters, promising that those new lanes would be the “solution to New York’s road mess.”That’s what they’ve been saying for decades. Each time another highway is planned, we are promised that it will relieve congestion. But just the opposite results: new highways attract cars like moths to a light bulb. They actually increase the use of automobiles and increase congestion.There are solutions to New York’s road mess that would also benefit New York City commuters, but it will take a lot more than a few thousand additional miles of concrete.Employers should be encouraged to stagger work times and make car-pooling a patriotic exercise. States and localities should make roads more versatile by marking off large, safe bike lanes. Motorcycles should be encouraged and New York City should mark off areas to park them, perhaps even without charge. (They take up much less room and save gasoline.) Most important, we should be investing in more public transportation.“Still Jumping Into the Job Pool” (Aug. 12) accurately highlights the extraordinary decline in employment among teenagers.

For a country whose legacy is built on freedom, justice and human rights, Americans should all be ashamed that we’ve hit a new low.“Still Jumping Into the Job Pool” (Aug. 12) accurately highlights the extraordinary decline in employment among teenagers. The article offers several possible explanations: teenagers may be productively preparing for college, or they may face reduced job opportunities because of cutbacks in summer job programs or increased competition from immigrants.However, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the teenage unemployment rate — the percentage of teenagers who are in the labor force (working or looking for work) but who do not have a job — was 15.4 percent in 2006. Although unacceptably high, this rate is the sixth lowest in the past 35 years and is typical for this stage in the economic cycle. Therefore, unusually scarce job opportunities are unlikely to account for today’s unusually low teenage employment rates.The writer is a professor, School of Public Affairs, Baruch College, and a research associate, National Bureau of Economic Research.Re “Greening Up by Cutting Down on Plastic Bags” (Aug. 5):One needs only read the quote from Kathy Young in your article — “I would never be convinced to bring my own bags. Never.” — to understand the depth of the paper vs. plastic issue.The only way to solve the problem of serial plastic bag users is to make all disposable bags — paper or plastic — unavailable. And the only way to accomplish that is through legislation.Phase 1: prohibit every large store from using disposable bags, while offering reusable bags at a nominal cost for sale at the register and encouraging customers to bring in their own bags to be re-used. Phase 2: extend this requirement to all other retail businesses.Yes, people will moan, but it’s amazing how adaptable we humans can be. The plastics industry can continue its recycling efforts by tracking down the billions of discarded bags already “in the system.” The bottom line here isn’t convenience; it’s the health of the environment, and for the greater good people should be required to take it seriously.My Dog Is Happier When He’s IndoorsRe “Who Let the Dogs Down,” by Jesse Scaccia (Op-Ed, Aug. 12):I am a dog owner.

"'07-08-19,'0','PROMPTED by the arrest of a 19-year-old man this month on charges of failing to provide food and shelter for six dogs, the police throughout Westchester have stepped up efforts to stop dogfighting and related betting.Acting on a tip, city police officers and officials from the Society for the Prevention and Cruelty to Animals of Westchester raided a house on South 16th Avenue on Aug. 10 and seized five American pit bull terriers and a Rottweiler, all sick and malnourished. They arrested a resident, Gladstone Dankin, and charged him with violating state agriculture law by failing to provide sustenance to the animals and improperly sheltering them; the city also cited him for not licensing the dogs.At the time of his arrest, Mr. Dankin was awaiting sentencing on felony convictions of reckless endangerment and criminal possession of stolen property, according to the police reports.The raid came after an injured pit bull terrier was found late last month lying on a city street with wounds suggesting that it had been involved in dogfighting. The dog, named Floyd by city workers, had more than 30 gashes, tears and punctures on his forelegs and body.City officials said the wounds indicated that the animal probably had been hung by a chain as bait so that other dogs could practice attacking him.'"
"'07-08-19,'0','Like many cities with large and growing immigrant populations, New Haven has been waiting for years for the federal government to enact sound immigration policies. As we have waited, thousands of immigrants have come to call New Haven home.This has changed our city, bringing some challenges — including public safety concerns stemming from workplace exploitation of immigrants in the form of low wages and abuse — but also many benefits. We have a new population of diligent workers and of bright young students eager to excel academically.Most immigrant families have become part of the fabric of our community. Their children attend schools with our children. They worship in our churches. They continue their search for a better life, as we all do.Over the last few years, New Haven has drawn attention for new city policies meant to welcome our neighbors: a police general order that assures immigrants that they will not be asked about their legal status if they report a crime; a program that provides immigrants with taxpayer identification numbers; and multipurpose identification cards for all city residents.These cards provide full access to city amenities like the public library and the golf course, and they also enable the bearers to open bank accounts. For the undocumented population, the cards offer the opportunity to stand up and be identified as residents of our city.Our interest has been merely to act sensibly in the face of gross neglect at the federal level. We have acted because to do nothing would be to ignore reality, fail all our residents and create disruption in our communities.But by vetoing in-state tuition for undocumented residents, the State of Connecticut seems to be moving in the opposite direction — following the example of the federal government and burying its head in the sand.According to a State Department of Education report, the number of high school graduates will peak in 2008 and then begin to decline. Coupled with the state’s aging population, this means we will soon face a serious shortage of skilled and educated workers. Already, the Connecticut Business and Industry Association points out that state manufacturers are having difficulty filling jobs.Yet rather than take advantage of talented young people already living here, rather than give them an education and allow them to address our labor shortage, the governor has set a course to harm the economy while directing young people toward low-skilled, low-paying jobs.As communities and elected officials, we can choose to either support the talents of the young people among us or blame them for their parents’ choices. To do nothing makes no sense, because one thing is certain: these children are staying here.'"
"'07-08-19,'0','I found your Aug. 12 editorial “Sickening Acts” infuriating. You decided to compare what you perceive Long Islanders think about tragedies related to Latino immigrants and animals such as Maximus, the pit bull that was set on fire by its owner. Your gauge of how quantifiably outraged people feel about these horrific situations seems based on the amount of press coverage they’ve received, and the subsequent reaction to said coverage.Tragedy is tragedy — and there are countless examples around us every day not only related to animals and Latino immigrants, but also children, the elderly and the poor. Those of us who love animals and are committed to preventing cruelty and abuse are also sickened by the suffering of our fellow humans; it’s just that animals hold a special place in our hearts because of their complete innocence as God’s creatures, their all-encompassing dependence on their human masters and their willingness to love us regardless of how badly some may treat them.Your attempt to compare “who cares more about what” is counterproductive, and serves no purpose in the overall goal of ending suffering wherever we see it.When I spoke to Jesse Scaccia (“Who Let the Dogs Down,” Op-Ed, Aug. 12), I specifically stated that barking dogs could not be considered a nuisance unless the barking was excessive and would prohibit a reasonable person from peaceably enjoying his or her premises. Additionally I mentioned that local laws, including New York City’s ill-conceived new law, sometimes define the length of time a dog can bark before the dog’s guardian can be charged.I agree that dogs should not be left unsupervised outdoors. Dogs can be stolen and suffer and die in inclement weather. A certain level of barking should be tolerated in our society.The writer is an animal rights attorney.'"
"'07-08-19,'0','Q We have occupied our top-floor co-op apartment for 28 years. The roof has always been off-limits to tenants because its structure is inadequate to support safe use. It is now necessary to replace the roof, and to help offset the cost, the co-op plans to strengthen the roof and then sell roof rights.As top-floor residents, we will have the right of first refusal to buy rights to the space over our apartment, but if we don’t, the board says they will be offered to others in the building.We bought an apartment on the top floor because we didn’t want anyone living above us. We prefer not to buy the roof rights, but we fear that the enjoyment of our apartment will be seriously compromised if someone else buys the space.What are our options?A Richard Klein, a Manhattan co-op and condominium lawyer, said that unless there is specific language in the co-op’s governing documents prohibiting the board from doing what it is proposing, the board would have the right to sell shares allocated to roof space in the building to the letter writer or to other shareholders in the building.The co-op may wish to apply to the New York attorney general’s office for what is known as a “no action letter,” which would confirm that the sale of the shares to the space would not violate the Martin Act, which regulates the sale of shares in a co-op.The board should also get an appraisal to determine the appropriate charge for the new shares and should amend the proprietary leases of the shareholders who purchase those shares to include, as part of the apartment descriptions, the additional roof space.The board should also make it clear what rights are conferred on the shareholders who buy shares allocated to the roof.'"
"'07-08-19,'0','There was a fine veal Bolognese, a great steak, and a superlative pairing of sautéed branzino atop a slice of pineapple and dressed with vanilla essence. But along with a bottle of wine, I wished I had brought a Tupperware container of sautéed snowpeas. (Interviewed after my visits, Mr. Foy said he was planning to add more produce.)Ms. Quiñones-Foy opened the seasonal 100-seat place in 2006 as a steakhouse, but it grew to have a more rounded menu, with a focus on seafood. Mr. Foy had worked behind the scenes since the restaurant’s inception, but took a visible role this spring, when he hired and trained Guillaume Thivet, the chef de cuisine, who created the luscious fish-pineapple-vanilla combination.The menu was short: eight appetizers, seven main dishes, those high-carbohydrate sides, seven desserts, a cheese plate and a couple of specials.Service was spotty. On one night, we had a polished waiter; on another, our waiter was unfailingly cheerful but couldn’t name the evening’s cheeses.The best bet on the appetizers list was the house-made gnocchi flavored with sage and mushrooms. The gnocchi were slightly heavy, but the combination was satisfying, with balanced flavors. Two others were runners-up: the mushroom soup, a special, with its deeply flavored, creamy base; and the impeccable sashimi tuna. Roasted red pepper salad was uninspired, and my portion had very little taste of shaved fennel despite the menu’s claim. Warm confit tomato and goat-cheese tart was a luxurious notion, but the heat from the tomato turned the cheese into a sensory overload. Too much butter obscured the sweet flavor of crab with thyme; scallop carpaccio was dressed with vanilla essence, but unlike the ethereal pairing of vanilla and branzino, this treatment overwhelmed the scallops.The standout in the main courses was the best veal Bolognese in recent memory — heady creaminess, high-quality meat and just enough tomato, spooned over housemade fettuccine. Sautéed sockeye salmon contained almost enough spinach to balance the fatty fish, and even enough soybeans, though they were undercooked, but it would have been kind to remove the ginger slices in the bouillon it was served in.Both steaks, the roasted dry-aged sirloin and the filet, were fine meats, though the filet arrived nearly raw when it was ordered medium-rare. Seared dayboat scallops sounded luscious, with the menu promising broccoli, flageolets, sun-dried tomatoes and pearl onions, but the dish was a tease; great scallops, lots of flageolets and a meager amount of other vegetables.Apple pie with ice cream is the best dessert, if it’s fresh. On one night, the crust was flabby; on the second visit, it was close to perfect.These myriad problems, however, are essentially minor. With consistent attention to detail and to balance, Bay Point Prime could be stellar.THE SPACE Softened industrial-commercial, with dining space on one end and the kitchen on the other. A few outdoor tables.THE CROWD Dressy-casual and affluent; a few children.THE BAR Bring your own.THE BILL Main courses, $26 to $42, though a lobster special was priced at $65. All major credit cards accepted.WHAT WE LIKE House-made gnocchi, mushroom soup; seared tuna and raw scallop duo, veal Bolognese with house-made fettuccine, sautéed salmon with spinach and soybeans in ginger bouillon, branzino with pineapple and vanilla, sirloin steak, sautéed mushrooms.IF YOU GO Open mid-May to mid-October; before Memorial Day weekend and from mid-September on, Fridays and Saturdays only.

"'07-08-19,'0','“You mean you haven’t told them?” Calloway asked with ominous calm.“Just give me the money, and they never need to know.”“But I’ve already been in negotiations with them,” Chib was saying. Mike saw that the gangster was stroking Westie’s face. Yes . . . because the Hell’s Angels gang back in Norway did a lot of international trading, and fine art made for useful collateral. On Calloway’s instructions, Westie was going to make more fakes with which to dupe Hate’s employers. And Hate’s employers didn’t know as yet that they’d been tricked with the first painting.It was impressive how fast Chib moved. Hate had turned away from the gangster to face the line of hostages again, trying to decide who would be the first to die. With his back to Calloway, he didn’t hear the snooker cue being lifted from the table, or feel the air change as it was swung at the back of his head. The force of contact snapped the wood in half with a crack, splinters falling into Mike’s lap. The giant stumbled but did not go down. Chib started raining blows, yelling for his henchmen to help him. The door opened and one man came running in.But Hate was fighting back. He threw Chib across the room, and suddenly Alice was screaming for help and struggling against her bonds. She was staring wide-eyed at the open door, beyond which lay the outside world, so reassuringly unchanged and normal. The pavement, a lamppost, the roadway. . . . Westie got the idea, too, and started wrestling with his chair until he tipped it over and commenced wriggling snakelike toward anywhere that wasn’t here.“I’ll get help,” Westie gasped, using the heel of one shoe to get some purchase on the wooden floor. As he moved, he left a slight trail, and Mike was reminded — suddenly, absurdly — of a snail beginning an epic journey. He turned his head to see if Laura was sharing his fantasy, but her eyes were on the wrestling match in front of her.And as for the art dealer . . . well, his shoulders were heaving with a crazed species of laughter as Johnno launched himself onto Hate’s back, arm around his neck. Chib was upright again and preparing to charge. Mike, despite his bonds, felt completely involved. Plus he was impressed at how fluid Chib’s mind was, an ally becoming the enemy in the blink of an eye. It remained to be seen, however, whether Hate’s demise would be the group’s salvation, and Mike wouldn’t put money on it, which was why he started working away at his own bonds. Westie was halfway to the door, Alice was still yelping and Chib was asking Johnno where Glenn was.“Thought he was right behind me,” the henchman said from between gritted teeth, as he continued to squeeze the life from Hate. But then the Scandinavian powered himself backward into one of the tables. There was an audible cracking sound as Johnno’s spine connected with the wooden edge, and he fell into a moaning heap. At the same time, a swipe of Hate’s fist caught Chib hard across the jaw, and the follow-up punch felled him, knocking him unconscious. Hate took a moment to gather himself. His face had turned puce from the near strangulation. He staggered toward the door and bent down to drag Westie away from all hope of freedom, hauling the chair upright again between Alice and Laura. Alice was weeping, her eyes on the floor rather than on her boyfriend. But Hate was turning his attention toward Mike, just managing to choke the words out.“I’m going to kill you all,” he said. “And then I’m going home.”“I bet you haven’t even seen the castle yet,” Mike teased. “Why not stay another day?”“I’m saving you till last,” the giant responded, stabbing a finger toward Mike.“Does that make me the weakest?”“You’re all weak! This whole city is weak!” And so saying, Hate reached behind his neck, his fingers feeling for something below his shirt. Slowly he pulled out a slender, gleaming knife and started to survey his kingdom: Chib unconscious on the floor, blood trickling from his ear; Johnno still lying in a heap, conscious but wishing otherwise; and the five trussed figures in their chairs. Mike decided it was now or never. His only hope was to charge the man, ram his head into his stomach. It wouldn’t do any good, but it was a plan. Hate himself seemed to sense the thought and offered the beginnings of a smile. The knife was drawn back, Mike tensed to pitch himself forward.“Hadn’t you better close the door?” Mike said, one last desperate attempt to postpone the inevitable. “Don’t want anyone seeing. . . . ”“Audiences don’t bother me,” Hate snarled, as Alice began shrieking and Laura started yelling with what, to Mike’s ear at least, was a truly startling level of invective. But nothing seemed to faze the brute, right up to the moment he heard the sound of guns being cocked.Figures streamed through the doorway, dressed in black and wearing visored helmets. On each chest, the word POLICE, picked out in white. The first man had dropped to one knee, gun aimed at Hate. Colleagues were flanking him. Hate shared a final look with Mike, a look worth a thousand words, and then dropped the knife with a clatter, raising his arms above his head, kneeling when ordered to, sliding his hands slowly around his back to await the handcuffs.Two more men were in the doorway now. One was the missing henchman, Glenn. The other was Detective Inspector Ransome. He was whistling a tune as he walked past Johnno and Chib, whistling as he reached down to pick up the knife, using it to slice Mike free.“We’ve not been properly introduced,” he said, holding out a hand for Mike to shake. But before that, Mike turned toward Laura once more.""You’ll testify against Calloway?” Detective Inspector Ransome asked as Mike was led in handcuffs to the waiting police van.“Should be the other way around,” Mike told him. “I was the one who got him involved.”“But you will testify.” Ransome made it sound like a statement of fact. “That way, it’ll go easier for you.”“Meaning six years instead of eight?”Ransome offered a shrug. “Easy to present you to the court as a citizen of previous good character who got in over his head. I’m sure you can afford to hire a whole battery of lawyers and psychologists to argue that you were not in your right mind at the time.”An ambulance was parked next to the van, and Mr. Watts-Fulton was being stretchered into it. Another would be needed for Johnno. One required a blood transfusion and some stitches, the other a new spine. Mike thought of Prof. Robert Gissing, who played them all like so many pieces on a board. Gissing, stealing art treasures for years, never detected but about to be undone by something as simple as an inventory. Gissing, railing against the fact that important works were in storage and out of view, making the same argument to everyone he met . . . in order to seek out a few gullible souls who might be persuaded to do something about it. And now Mike would go to jail and Westie would go to jail and Allan Cruikshank would go to jail. Westie didn’t look too bothered, actually, relieved he wouldn’t be dying horribly tonight. He was saying something to his girlfriend about how prisoners got to go to art classes.“Might make the Westie brand even more famous when I come out,” he was trying to persuade her.While all Alice herself was doing was sobbing quietly and intently.Even with all the restraints, Hate was still trying to break free, like a force of nature out of anyone’s control. The rear door of a patrol car was open, waiting for him to be coaxed inside. Another one waited for Chib Calloway and his henchman Glenn. Glenn was yelling that Ransome owed him, owed him everything. Ransome ignored the outburst and concentrated on Mike instead.“So Robert Gissing’s got all the missing paintings?” he asked.Mike nodded. “Chib’s got a couple of the ones we swapped, if he hasn’t already trashed them. For what it’s worth, they were meant to be Allan’s, only Allan decided he wanted nothing to do with them.”“Pity he waited till after the heist,” Ransome commented.“While Gissing has three, plus all the others he’s stolen down the years?”“Leaving you with what exactly, Mr. Mackenzie?”“A story to tell the grandkids?” Mike speculated. He watched Laura being brought out of the snooker hall. “Miss Stanton’s got nothing to do with it,” he told the detective. “She just happened by my place as Calloway’s goons came calling.”Ransome nodded his agreement. “We’ll see she gets home,” he said. “Just as soon as we’ve taken her statement.”“Thanks,” Mike added. He puffed out his cheeks and expelled a long burst of air.“Not easy being a criminal mastermind, is it, sir?” Ransome asked with a smile. Laura was heading toward them. She touched the detective on the arm, reminding Mike that the two of them knew each other in college. He started to wonder just how close they’d actually been. . . . He was a determined little beggar even then, was what she’d told Mike.“Any chance of a word with the prisoner?” Laura was asking. Ransome seemed reluctant, but Laura’s eyes won him over, and he stepped away from them, toward the patrol car that held Chib Calloway. Laura watched him go, then turned to Mike. “I asked you to save the day,” she told him, “and you did.”“You might not have noticed,” he replied, “but it really didn’t have much to do with me.”“Well, take this anyway.” She leaned in and kissed him on the lips. A moment later, they kissed again.“Least I could do.” She folded her arms around herself. “Will you go to prison for a long time?”“Will you be waiting for me?”“I asked first,” she reminded him, so he considered the question.“I’ll probably make bail,” he guessed. “And I’ll have the best lawyers money can buy.”“Probably,” he agreed. “Will you come visit me in jail?”“You’ve just said it yourself — you might not go to jail.”“Will it be smelly and disgusting and full of leering, tattooed lifers?’“Then I’ll have to think about it.”“I’ll need someone to bring me stuff. Maybe I could give you a shopping list.”He pretended to be thinking. “Atlases,” he said at last. “World atlases. Plus travel books, art books, lists of museums and galleries of renown.”“You’re going to better yourself in prison?” she guessed.He decided that the best thing to do was nod agreement. She didn’t get it, not just yet.Didn’t get that there was someone he needed to find, soon as they let him out.Three years later. . . . Professor Gissing was in the study of his whitewashed home in the center of Tangier. The windows were open, the sun high overhead. He could hear the sounds of business wafting up from the market downstairs. Bartering and general gossip, plus the diesel chug of ancient vans and trucks. They never really disturbed him. He was happy here with his books and his glass of infused mint tea. There were fine rugs overlapping on the floor and fine paintings covering a lot of the wall space. He had no telephone, and he received no mail. He had access to the Internet, thanks to the cafe at the end of the street, but seldom had recourse to it. He didn’t buy the available newspapers and watched no TV. His favorite CDs were in a stack next to the hi-fi: Bach played by Glenn Gould, Karajan conducting Mozart, the Brandenburgs. . . . He had vowed to read more Proust and Tolstoy and maybe even try some Latin and Greek. He reckoned he had another 15 or 20 years in him, and this was plenty of time, wasn’t it? Plenty of time to savor each morsel, each sip, each musical note, each stroke of the brush. Tangier was similar to Edinburgh in some ways, a village masquerading as a city. After three years — four years next month — he was no longer a stranger to his neighbors and the market traders. The cafe’s owner invited him to dine with his family. Street children liked to tease him about the beard he’d grown and the garish bow ties he wore as he sat out on the pavement in the evening, fanning himself with a venerable Panama hat. It was neither a better nor a worse life than the one he had in Edinburgh; it was different, that was all.And then the doorbell sounded, and his reverie was broken.He rose to his feet and padded across the floor.Was he expecting anyone?Yes, always . . . always . . . always. . . .Next: On Sept. 9, the debut of a murder mystery by Cathleen Schine.'"
"'07-08-19,'0','Until recently, it’s been difficult to take vegan cuisine (made with no animal products) seriously. Vegan menus were full of things like vegan meatloaf and tofu cheese, imitations that only served to highlight what the food was missing. Without a cultural context, vegan has seemed more contrivance than a cuisine.But with the influx of immigrants from Asia and the subcontinent, vegan has found a new footing in the New York region. These cultures rely more heavily on vegetables and legumes than Western cuisines do, and as a result, the food is naturally (so to speak) vegan.Ahimsa (Sanskrit for “nonviolence”) is a nice example of this new breed of vegan restaurant. It is a family place that is the brainchild of 18-year-old Nirav Shah, who designed and opened the restaurant as a way of putting his passion for vegan philosophy into practice. His mother, Anita, and Mr. Shah’s younger brother, Nikhil, do most of the cooking, and one night I met Mr. Shah’s father waiting tables. Both parents are from Mumbai.The menu is made up of dishes from several cultures. About one third of the dishes are raw. Nearly 80 percent of the restaurant’s produce is organic, and, according to Nirav, the family plans to use some locally grown produce in the fall.My favorite meal was the $38 chef’s tasting menu, gracefully served by Nikhil. At my request, choices were predominantly Indian with some Sri Lankan dishes; none were on the regular menu, but I was told some will be soon.'"
"'07-08-19,'0','For two years he worked at night in the company of guards and two other inmates, who helped with the scaffold. “Sometimes I painted for a couple of hours, and sometimes I kept at it until sunrise,” he said. “They let me go at my own pace.”The murals chronicle not only California’s history, but also the evolution of Mr. Santos’s style. The first scenes, including an Indian village and the Franciscan missionary Junípero Serra, are rendered in the listless fashion of a 1950s textbook illustration, with isolated vignettes surrounded by areas of blank wall. “At the beginning I wanted to be conservative, to please the prison officials,” he said.But soon vignettes crowd the walls, playing like a crazy newsreel of random images; at one point a covered wagon rumbles westward not far from where an owlish Groucho Marx peeps over a movie screen. Unifying compositional elements — the World War II bomber that dominates the fourth mural, for example — lend a W.P.A.-era monumentality.The fifth mural, with its oil well gushing from a huge human arm and its gargantuan hog carcasses dangling from the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge, feels far more hallucinatory and dreamlike. Interspersed with the grand images are small, humorous scenes, like a man with binoculars gazing at a high-rise window where a woman is undressing and a burly World War II inductee (the portrait of a much-hated prison guard) wincing as a doctor gives him a shot.The sixth and final mural, whose style might be best described as Expressionism meets Saturday morning cartoons, depicts rodeos, fairs, football games and other public events. It fairly explodes with comical, hatchet-faced characters, from flamenco dancers at a mission fiesta to fans thronging a Hollywood premiere. “That mural is 100 percent original,” Mr. Santos said. “I wanted to give the guys something to laugh at, but I can tell you that I worked real fast on it, since my parole date was coming up. I didn’t want to give anyone an excuse to keep me.”Eduardo Pineda, a longtime community muralist, is the director of education for the Museum of the African Diaspora in nearby San Francisco and has visited the murals. “What Santos does with space and perspective is very sophisticated,” he said. “The murals are highly cinematic, with powerful narration.”Though for decades the murals remained in excellent condition, they now are defaced in places by prisoner graffiti. “San Quentin used to be populated exclusively by long-term inmates, and respect for the murals was part of the older prison culture,” said Lt. Eric Messick, San Quentin’s public information officer. “But around 1988 we also became a reception center for newly sentenced inmates, and most of them are younger guys who just don’t have the connection with the murals. That’s when the tagging started.”Steve Emerick, who runs the prison’s Arts in Corrections program, said that the inmates themselves could do the required restoration if they were trained or supervised by an expert. “But that requires funding we simply don’t have,” he said. Restorations were carried out in the late 1960s, when a clear protective coating was applied, and again in the 1990s.A greater threat to the murals may be the continuing tug of war over closing all or part of San Quentin. Established in 1852, it is California’s oldest and possibly most dilapidated prison, and its 432 prime waterfront acres are coveted by developers and local governments. A 2003 preliminary redevelopment study called for preserving the murals but without indicating how or where. A current bill in the California Assembly would prohibit construction of a proposed new death row at San Quentin until the state studies moving the execution chamber elsewhere.After his parole in 1955, Mr. Santos worked at Disneyland as a caricaturist and then opened a studio and gallery in San Diego, his hometown. But after pleading guilty to possession of marijuana, he fled to Mexico, where he owned a succession of galleries in Guadalajara, Mexico City and Acapulco. Returning to the United States in 1967, he painted, made sculptures of carved wood and found objects and ran a popular gallery and bohemian gathering spot in the Catskills village of Fleischmanns, N.Y. (An exhibition of his work is on display there through Aug. 31 at the Art et cetera gallery.) More than 20 years ago, after a divorce and a heart attack, he moved back to San Diego.Though his San Quentin murals are among the most significant works of Mr. Santos’s career, for years even close friends knew nothing of them. “I never bragged about the murals because I was too embarrassed to tell people I’d been to prison as a young man,” he said.In 2003 he returned to San Quentin to see the murals for the first time in nearly a half century. “Someone put a shiny varnish on them that I didn’t like,” he recalled, “but it made me happy to look at them again and to think about all the guys who might have enjoyed them over the years.”'"
"'07-08-19,'0','Arthur Key, one of the characters at the center of Ron Carlson’s bluntly beautiful and unnerving novel, is a set builder for Hollywood films, a designer of three-sided barns, parts of fences and corners of houses, “sometimes just a frame with a tile roof.” He’s dependable and a stickler for safety, willing to lose a job to save a few lives. Which makes it that much worse when his brother dies on a film set after Arthur has failed to look out for him.Taking flight from the collapsing facade of his professional life, Arthur winds up on a ragged plateau in the mountains of Idaho, hired, along with a gangly teenage criminal, by a gruff ranch foreman for a spectacular and completely useless project: building a monster ramp to a nearby canyon, intended for a female motorcycle daredevil.For most of the novel, we’re given only partial details about the stunt itself, which Arthur dismisses as “stupidity and a lot of money meeting in some bad, temporary place.” Instead, Carlson turns our attention to the landscape — an ominous stretch of badlands, sporadically illuminated by distant forest fires — and to the emerging friendship between these three prickly, mistrustful men.Still reeling from the recent death of his wife, Darwin, the ranch foreman, harbors a poorly articulated rage, which simmers alongside Arthur’s shame and guilt. Next to these two, the teenage criminal, Ronnie, who looks “like Sinatra at 19,” seems the picture of mental health.At the outset, Carlson’s central characters are mostly sizing up one another’s skills and limitations, like shipwreck survivors figuring out who to send off in search of help. But before long they settle into a comfortable — even brusquely domestic — rhythm. Arthur plays big brother to Ronnie. Darwin cooks. Ronnie falls for a local girl.In keeping with his portrayal of this makeshift male family, Carlson lingers on small moments of pleasure in their daily lives: the morning’s first gulp of steaming coffee, the sound of eggs cracking over a hot pan, the damp feel of a cold can of beer. Some of his richest descriptions are lavished on the most incongruous subjects: a road grader, for example, is “rusted fully at every dent, the pale yellow state-guard paint oxidized everywhere else to a papery white.”'"
"'07-08-19,'0','BAGHDAD, Aug. 18 — Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki has lost the support of the largest Shiite, Sunni and secular parties in Parliament. Some American officials privately describe him as a paranoid failure, while his only recent success has been a meeting on Saturday with senior Sunni, Shiite and Kurdish leaders. It yielded little more than promises of future compromise.That appears to be, in part, because neither the Americans nor the Iraqis can agree on who is supposed to lead. In the absence of a strong alternative to Mr. Maliki, both camps have come to rely on a game of criticize and run. The Americans bash him, then say it is up to the Iraqis to decide what to do. The Iraqis call him a sectarian incompetent, then say they are waiting for the Americans to stop acting as his patron.The latest salvo came Saturday from the American ambassador, Ryan C. Crocker. Traveling with Gen. David H. Petraeus, the top commander in Iraq, Mr. Crocker acknowledged that the public’s frustration with the government was “pretty striking.”He noted that there was as much anger within the government as outside, on the streets.But the Americans, he said, would not respond to that pressure anytime soon. When asked whether the Americans might push for a change of leadership, he said, “That’s a discussion the Iraqis have to have.”According to the Constitution, either the president or one-fifth of the 275-member Parliament can make a no-confidence motion. Then an absolute majority vote would mean the administration had been “resigned.”'"
"'07-08-19,'0','The health of the nation’s 300,000 nail salon workers has become a major concern for many environmental and women’s organizations, which often point to academic studies that highlight the hazards posed by the chemicals manicurists use.Studies led by professors at Wayne State University in Detroit and published in a journal on neurology found that nail salon work was associated with poor performance on tests of attention, mental processing speed, memory and verbal learning.A study by researchers at the University of Toronto and other institutions found that children who were prenatally exposed to the compounds these workers use performed worse on tests for cognitive function, language and behavior.“The intensity of exposure for salon workers is 1,200 times what it would be for the average American,” said Sonya Lunder, a senior analyst for the Environmental Working Group, a nonprofit organization that seeks to protect public health and the environment. “Immigrant women often don’t understand the safety information.”In California, where three-fourths of the 80,000 nail salon workers are Vietnamese, Vietnamese groups have begun an education campaign on salon safety. California law requires the government to list products containing chemicals that cause cancer or birth defects, and three compounds long used in nail salons — toluene, formaldehyde and dibutyl phthalate — are on the list.'"

"'07-08-20,'1','Written by a Bradford teacher, Sajid Hussain, 34, who holds a degree from Oxford, the new curriculum is being taught in some religious classes here, in a city that is increasingly segregated between South Asians and whites.The pilot effort in Bradford has the backing, and the financing, of the Labor government. It is part of a hearts-and-minds campaign that the government hopes will eventually spread to other cities, and help better integrate the country’s mainstream Muslims into British culture. Approximately two million Muslims, mostly of Pakistani and Bangladeshi origin, live in Britain.Since four British Muslim suicide bombers attacked the London transit system in July 2005 and two other major terrorist plots were uncovered last year in which British Muslim men were suspected, British officials have been struggling with how to isolate the extremist Muslim minority from the moderate majority.The new prime minister, Gordon Brown, said at his first news conference last month that he wanted to demonstrate the “importance we attach to nonviolence, the importance we attach to the dignity of each individual,” and in the process make unpalatable the “extreme message of those who practice violence and would maim and murder citizens on British soil.”“The question for us is, how we can separate those extremists from the moderate mainstream majority,” he said.The Labor government has been concerned about a loss of credibility among British Muslims, in part because of the country’s involvement in Iraq. So Mr. Brown’s aides say that the Bradford curriculum’s virtues include that it is taught by forward-leaning imams and that it matches messages from the Koran with everyday life in Britain.An estimated 100,000 school-age Muslim children attend religious classes held at mosques in Britain daily, generally after regular school hours, said Jane Houghton, a spokeswoman for the Department of Communities and Local Government. “The impact this teaching could have is quite considerable,” she said.But as much as the government likes the curriculum, it has faced opposition from some Muslims.Why, asked Nuzhat Ali, the women’s coordinator of the Islamic Society of Britain in Bradford, should Muslim children be singled out for civics lessons?“One of our primary concerns is: why the Muslim community again?” Mrs. Ali said. “Extremism is a problem in all communities, especially among the British National Party,” she said, referring to a right-wing party that has articulated white supremacist views. “The issue of terror and extremism needs to be addressed across the board rather than saying: ‘Here, Muslims, go into your corner and have your curriculum.’ ”Some of the specifics of the curriculum met with disapproval, too.In lesson plans provided to imams by Mr. Hussain, the teachers were asked to pose questions to their students based on recent events in Britain.In one example, the students were to be asked what they would do if a friend bought a large quantity of fertilizer and announced he planned to build a bomb with it. The question was based on the evidence in a recent trial in London, in which five Muslim men were found guilty of buying fertilizer, storing it and planning to use it for a terrorist attack.Another question involved a character, “Ahmad,” whose friends were hatching a plot to attack a supermarket in retaliation for the war in Iraq. “Is it right for Ahmad to harm innocent Britons just because their government invaded a Muslim country?” was the proposed question in one of Mr. Hussain’s lesson plans.After a heated meeting with the critics in Bradford, Mr. Hussain, who said he had submitted the curriculum to a vetting panel of half a dozen Muslim scholars, agreed to remove the examples from the curriculum. “They were perhaps a little too frontal,” he said.But the important point, Mr. Hussain said, was to show Muslim students that their religion provided some answers to issues they confronted every day.“They understand that it’s wrong to go out and commit suicide bombings,” Mr. Hussain said. “But some got really confused when you put jihad next to it. Jihad has got a sacred context, so things that were unacceptable became acceptable. We had to dig down to defuse the misconception.”Then there was the problem of dress. The syllabus asks whether British Muslims should try to wear Islamic dress at work when there is a code for formal suits. And what about the hijab that some Muslim women wear to cover their hair, or the niqab, which covers the face, except for the eyes?“Some of the scholars said, if you’re teaching, not being able to see the teacher’s face is not good,” Mr. Hussain said. “So we could tell the youngsters our faith tells us not to alienate ourselves, and that there is a lot of diversity of opinion.”'"
"'07-08-20,'1','In fact, how people cope with the suspension seems to reflect the evolution of Russian attitudes. Younger Muscovites, who are less familiar with the hardships of the past and are as comfortable with Nokia and Pizza Hut as their peers in suburban New Jersey, seem far less forgiving.The older generation certainly complains, but also seems more willing to shrug it off. After all, what are a few weeks without hot water, given everything else that has been weathered over the decades? This view may be especially prevalent in Moscow, the largest city in Europe, whose population has surged with an influx of people from hardscrabble regions.“We are all basically country folk,” said Lidia Artyomova, 52, a maid. “We are used to this sort of thing, so there’s nothing to be done.”Ms. Artyomova was working the other day at an apartment building without hot water on Sadovaya-Karetnaya Street, in one of the city’s better neighborhoods. Soon after she spoke, up drove a resident, Roman Berezin, 25, a student with a dog in the backseat and a harsher view.“It’s very unpleasant,” Mr. Berezin said. “I like to take a shower twice a day, and without hot water, you end up going back and forth, back and forth, back and forth, carrying the water from the kitchen to the bathroom.”Of course, as under Communism, ways are devised to skirt the common misery. Some buildings, including hotels, install boilers, and some people put small water heaters in bathrooms — both are legal. But many cannot afford to do so, or live in dwellings whose plumbing and electricity cannot handle the equipment.Moscow is not alone in its summertime water woes. St. Petersburg and other Russian cities have similar systems. But it galls some Muscovites that a city of such power and money cannot provide a basic necessity year round.“We often think about why the city cannot fix all the pipes,” said Aleksandr Savin, 38, another resident of the building on Sadovaya-Karetnaya Street, who runs a package delivery company. “How come they have to do this every year? And then there are the accidents, so they have to turn off the cold water sometimes, too.”Moscow officials acknowledge the system’s failings, but note that they have been spending hundreds of millions of dollars in recent years on replacing pipes, some of which did not function all that well even when they were installed during Stalin’s rule.Irina Negazina, an official at the city agency that oversees the system, said she hoped that pipe replacements would be complete in as little as five years. At that point, the suspensions, which roll across Moscow as crews move from site to site, should be briefer, she said. They might last only a few days, she said, because only plants should require major repairs.Still, the feeling of frustration when the faucets run dry is widespread, as was captured by a prominent poet, Tatyana Shcherbina.They’ve turned off all the hot water, my liquid of love, my stream of words.I should complain to the people, but a scarf’s been thrown over my mouth.Like this, without moisture of life, I’ll dry out, along with the unwashed dishes, I’ll gather moss, a stone unturned, or perhaps be forgotten, lost in the grass.For now, with a respite a long way off, Russians, as always, find ways of getting by.“We pretend we are angry and complain about it mockingly, and sometimes we go to visit those friends who have hot water in their apartments,” said Dmitri Kuper, 39, a clothing designer with a fondness for tattoos and piercings who lives in the building on Sadovaya-Karetnaya Street. “I simply call my friends and tell them, ‘I am coming to see you, and I will have my towel with me!’ ”'"
"'07-08-20,'1','Joe Davis, a spokesman for the organization, said Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Obama were invited because they appeared to be the leading candidates on the Democratic side. Republicans Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney declined invitations months ago, Mr. Davis said, so Mr. McCain and Mr. Thompson were invited in their place.Mrs. Clinton, a New York Democrat who serves on the Armed Services Committee, emphasized her commitment to improving services for military veterans. In a 41-minute speech, she ticked through a detailed list of the legislation she has supported in Congress, receiving applause from much of the crowd.“I’m not going to have a secretary of veterans affairs,” Mrs. Clinton said. “I’m going to have a secretary for veterans.”She devoted about three minutes of her remarks to the mission in Iraq, acknowledging that many people in the audience disagreed with her position to begin withdrawing troops. She spoke in measured tones, repeatedly praising the men and women of the military, while gently criticizing the administration’s strategy.As a presidential candidate, it was an unusual position for Mrs. Clinton, who has weathered criticism from some Democrats for initially supporting the war. In today’s lineup, though, it was her opposition to the war that was at odds with some people seated in the crowd.“There is a vigorous debate in our own nation and probably among many of you about the right way forward in Iraq,” Mrs. Clinton said. “I know we may disagree about whether there is or isn’t a military solution to this war.”She added: “The American people and the American military cannot want freedom and stability for the Iraqis more than they want it for themselves.”During the part of her speech on Iraq, the downtown convention hall here was largely silent. Several times during the rest of her remarks, the applause was started by three young people in the middle of the room who were neither wearing the trademark blue VFW cap or convention name badges.While Mrs. Clinton offered a detailed accounting of the legislation she has introduced on behalf of veterans, she did not discuss other votes related to the war, including proposals to set a deadline for a troop withdrawal or the emergency wartime spending request she opposed in May.Looking ahead to September, when Congress will receive a progress report on the Iraq strategy, Mrs. Clinton said: “We will have some very hard decisions to make. I ‘m not sure there are any good options.”Mr. McCain, a forceful advocate of the Iraq strategy, offered an opposing view when he took the stage shortly after Mrs. Clinton. Pulling troops from Iraq, he said, would be “a mistake of colossal historical proportions.”“As we all know, the war in Iraq has not gone well, and the American people have grown sick and tired of it,” said Mr. McCain, an Arizona Republican. “I understand that, of course. I, too, have been made sick at heart by the many mistakes made by civilian and military commanders and the terrible price we have paid for them.“But we cannot react to these mistakes,” he added, “by embracing a course of action that will be an even greater mistake.”'"
"'07-08-20,'1','The N.F.L. said today in a written statement: “We are aware of Michael Vick’s decision to enter a guilty plea to the federal charges against him and accept responsibility for his conduct. We totally condemn the conduct outlined in the charges, which is inconsistent with what Michael Vick previously told both our office and the Falcons. We will conclude our own review under the league’s personal conduct policy as soon as possible. In the meantime, we have asked the Falcons to continue to refrain from taking action. pending a decision by the commissioner.”The government, in their prosecution of the case, put tremendous pressure on Mr. Vick to accept a plea deal and not take the matter to trial.On Friday, two of Mr. Vick’s co-defendants pled guilty in the case and agreed to testify against him. A third had pled guilty last month and agreed to testify, and prosecutors said they had three other cooperating witnesses.The charges in Mr. Vick’s indictment carry a possible maximum sentence of five years in prison and a $250,000 fine. The plea deal probably calls for prosecutors to recommend a lighter sentence as long as Mr. Vick cooperates with the government’s investigation.The two men who entered pleas on Friday, Purnell A. Peace and Quanis L. Phillips, signed lengthy statements which outlined Mr. Vick’s involvement in the dog fighting ring.Mr. Phillips said that he, Mr. Peace and Mr. Vick killed about eight dogs that did not perform well by hanging and drowning them at a facility that Mr. Vick owned in Surry, Va., in April.Both confirmed that the enterprise, Bad Newz Kennels, and the gambling associated with it were “almost exclusively funded by Vick.”They also described numerous times when all four co-defendants traveled across state lines to sponsor dogs in fights.Their pleas, along with that of Tony Taylor on July 30, prompted widespread speculation that Mr. Vick would accept a plea agreement.Mr. Vick was believed to have been given until last Friday morning to agree to accept the plea deal, but that deadline passed without an announcement from either side.The Falcons’ owner, Arthur Blank, told The Associated Press on Friday night, “It seems to be a pretty clear indication there will be some sort of plea entered.”The government’s criminal case might not be on the only one Mr. Vick has to worry about. Gerald Poindexter, the state prosecutor for Surry County, told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution on Friday that he plans to bring charges on Sept. 25 against Mr. Vick and others alleged to be connected to the dog-fighting ring.'"
"'07-08-20,'1','“Recent market uncertainty over subprime mortgages must have been a concern for HSBC in its talks over Korea Exchange,” Mr. Lee said. “It is noteworthy that it still went ahead and announced its intention. It means HSBC doesn’t see a big problem there.”Lone Star is one of several private equity funds that bought distressed South Korean companies in the aftermath of the Asian financial crisis in the late 1990s. Lone Star bought 50.5 percent of Korea Exchange for $1.5 billion in 2003 and later increased its total stake to 64.6 percent, reaping huge gains as the economy recovered. In June, it sold a 13.6 percent stake worth $1.3 billion to buyers including Hana Financial Group of South Korea. It still holds 51 percent.Lone Star has been trying to cash out its investment, but it has been engaged in protracted legal battles with South Korean prosecutors.Last November, Lone Star canceled a $7.4 billion deal to sell its entire stake to South Korea’s top lender, Kookmin Bank, complaining about local prosecutors’ investigation of its operations here. DBS, a Singapore bank, had held talks with Lone Star about a possible purchase but ended negotiations, hinting at legal issues.South Korean prosecutors brought charges against six people last year, including a former Korea Exchange president, accusing them of manipulating the bank’s financial data to help Lone Star acquire the bank at a less-than-fair price in 2003.Lone Star denies any involvement. South Korean financial regulators say they will wait for a final court ruling before deciding whether to approve any sale of Korea Exchange.Hong Jin Pyo, an analyst at Good Morning Shinhan Securities, said the local regulators would probably approve Lone Star’s sale of its stake, regardless of the outcome of the court case.“But if the case drags on, it will help HSBC in its negotiations,” Mr. Hong said.Foreign banks have recently sought acquisitions as a means to expand in South Korea. Standard Chartered beat out HSBC to acquire Korea First Bank in 2005.“HSBC wants to expand its presence in Asia,” said Ku Yong-uk, an analyst at Daewoo Securities in Seoul. “But in South Korea it could not get a full banking operation license and was only able to open branch offices mainly for individual customers. This deal, if it goes through, will give HSBC a network to enter full-fledged banking service in South Korea.”'"
"'07-08-20,'1','After weeks of volatility, stocks ended the day on Wall Street today pretty much where they started.Trading in a fairly narrow range, shares dipped in the early afternoon, rallied in the final hour, and ended little changed. At the close, the Dow Jones industrial average was up 42.27 points to 13,121.35, a gain of 0.3 percent. The Nasdaq composite’s gain was even slighter, and the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index finished down a fraction of a point.The uneventful session followed a big rebound in Asian stock markets and strong gains in Europe as well.Like American and European investors, Asian investors appeared heartened by the Federal Reserve’s decision to lower rates on loans to banks, known as the discount rate. The Fed announced the move after most Asian markets closed on Friday.The Tokyo benchmark Nikkei index rose 3 percent, recovering more than half of Friday’s 5.42 percent decline. Australia’s benchmark S.& P./ASX 200 rose 4.6 percent in its biggest one-day gain in almost a decade and other markets in the region, including Hong Kong, New Zealand, South Korea and Taiwan also gained.That rally carried over into Europe, extending gains that began after the Fed’s move. The Dow Jones Stoxx 600 index rose 0.7 percent, to 362.33, in London. It dropped 9.1 percent from a six-and-half-year high on June 1 after investors began to worry that defaults among American borrowers with poor credit profiles might spread to other asset classes.'"

The Dow Jones Stoxx 600 index rose 1.1 percent to 364 in London. It dropped 9.1 percent from a 6 1/2-year high on June 1 after investors began to worry that defaults among American borrowers with poor credit profiles might spread to other asset classes.Asian markets rebounded today with the Tokyo benchmark index rising 3 percent, recouping more than half of Friday’s 5.42 percent decline. Australia’s benchmark S&P/ASX 200 rose 4.6 percent in its biggest one-day gain in almost a decade and other markets in the region, including Hong Kong, New Zealand, South Korea and Taiwan also gained.Some investors in Europe today returned to riskier assets, such as equities, in hope of finding bargains.

"'07-08-20,'1','The number of diagnosed cases of diabetes increased by 61 percent from 1991 to 2001, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That went along with a 74 percent increase in obesity, the agency noted, “reflecting the strong correlation between obesity and the development of diabetes.”But those numbers may or may not reveal that the actual number of people with diabetes has exploded. It may just be that more people are learning they have the disease, not that the number of those with it is increasing.To get a better idea of whether the disease is striking more people or whether more people who have the disease are receiving diagnoses, statisticians have turned to another set of federal data. It is from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, a periodic survey of a representative group of Americans that not only asks whether people have been told they have diabetes but that also includes blood tests to find undiagnosed cases.In a paper published last year in Diabetes Care, federal scientists used those data to ask what was the total proportion of the population with diabetes — diagnosed and undiagnosed.Their surprising conclusion, said Katherine M. Flegal, an author of the paper and an epidemiologist at the National Center for Health Statistics, was that the overall age-adjusted proportion of the population that has diabetes had not really changed from 1988 to 2002, the most recent year for which federal data are available.In two subgroups, though — men and non-Hispanic blacks — there was a small but statistically significant increase in the diabetes rate. In general, blacks, Hispanics and Asians are more likely to develop diabetes than whites, and regions with many immigrants of those racial and ethnic groups may experience a surge in the population of people diagnosed with diabetes. But that, of course, does not reveal whether the nation as a whole is experiencing a sharply increasing rate of diabetes.'"
"'07-08-20,'1','So how do a bunch of bike messengers and their friends unwind on a weekend afternoon? With a bike man’s holiday — a grueling race that substituted the claustrophobic corridors of Manhattan with the wide, steep boulevards of Staten Island.Shortly before 3:30 p.m. Saturday, about 40 men and women on bicycles pedaled through the parking lot of the Staten Island Ferry terminal, having just received the day’s orders from two long-haired men drinking from tall cans of Budweiser.The competitors had a deadline and a mission: Get their manifests signed or stamped at various spots around the island. “Real bike racing is a rich man’s sport,” said Mike Dee, a messenger and an organizer of the race, called the Staten Island Invasion. “This is like the bike race for the rest of us — people who like to drink a beer in the mornings.”It was the kind of race for which Pete Lang, a 25-year-old messenger, warmed up by smoking a cigarette. There was no set course, just a starting place, a finish line and about 20 checkpoints in between.The race was designed to replicate the daily work of a messenger, with each racer using his or her speed, reflexes and instincts to find the fastest route from one checkpoint to the other, get the manifest signed and do it all as quickly as possible. This was a high-thrills, low-reward affair: a two-and-a-half-hour scramble, with the winner pedaling home not with tons of cash but with a few hard-earned points and a bag of goodies.'"
"'07-08-20,'1','BERLIN — Perhaps the most closely watched figure in European legal circles this summer has been Bo Vesterdorf, the Danish judge who heads Europe’s top appeals court, with antitrust lawyers hanging on his every public utterance.They are interested in how the Court of First Instance, the body that he leads, will rule when it announces its decision Sept. 17 on Microsoft’s appeal of Europe’s biggest antitrust case ever. But Judge Vesterdorf, 61, who has said he plans to retire on the day the decision is made public, has avoided any discussion of the case.Christopher Fretwell, a court spokesman, said Judge Vesterdorf, who has presided over the court since March 1998, would not give interviews on the case before the Microsoft verdict.“He’s been very, very careful not to give anything away,” said Jonathan Zuck, the president of the Association for Competitive Technology, a group based in Washington that has intervened in the case to support Microsoft. “But whatever comes out, there are huge issues that will be decided here.”Less than a month before the ruling’s publication, expectations for a watershed decision are running high. And despite the information vacuum, lawyers on both sides of the case say they expect the court to render a split decision of sorts — giving both Microsoft and the European Commission victories on key legal points.Microsoft, the reasoning goes, will prevail on the issue of bundling, with the court recognizing the company’s right to wrap new extras like voice recognition, antivirus and media player software into its dominant Windows operating system.'"

"'07-08-20,'1','On the one side, Wall Street banks and brokerage firms, as they did with Sowood, have stepped up their demands for more cash and collateral as they restrict the money they are willing to lend.On the other, jittery investors seem ready to flee at any sign of trouble, as they did from the Bear Stearns Asset-Backed Securities Fund. The fund had a solid track record, no leverage and little exposure to subprime mortgages, but after it reported losses in July, investors demanded their money and Bear Stearns was forced to suspend redemptions.Liquidity — the ability to quickly sell an asset at a reasonable value — is the linchpin to markets functioning effectively, and its absence in recent weeks has led to substantial losses in many highly leveraged hedge funds.“For hedge funds, illiquidity is their Achilles’ heel,” said one fund investor who was not authorized to speak to the media.Pressure from banks to raise margin levels as well as pressure from investors could not have come at a worse time for hedge funds; the prices of the debt instruments they hold continue to fall, if they trade at all. Stocks widely held by hedge funds, from small-cap value stocks to potential targets for leveraged buyouts, have been pummeled. And with volatility in the markets, banks and hedge funds are scrambling to reduce risk and sell those securities that can be easily sold.“It’s not that suddenly everyone is out of cash — they just don’t want to lend it or invest it,” said Frederick H. Joseph, a head of investment banking at Morgan Joseph & Company, a boutique investment bank, and the former head of Drexel Burnham Lambert, the investment bank that survived an insider trading scandal but collapsed two years later when banks shut off financing.A liquidity vacuum is scary for any market player, but it can be particularly hazardous to hedge funds that try to make money by spotting anomalies in the market. When liquidity dries up and fear takes over, prices start to behave abnormally and the funds’ bets go haywire.“Hedge funds can withdraw liquidity rapidly, particularly when facing mounting losses, and this can cause severe market dislocation on the rare occasions when they all head for the exit door at the same time,” said Andrew W. Lo, a professor at the M.I.T. Sloan School of Management.The dash to sell has been exacerbated by the interconnected nature of the players in the market and the securities they hold.Because of problems in subprime mortgages, large “multistrategy” funds, those that trade many different kinds of securities or use diverse strategies, faced increased margin calls on their mortgage- or credit-related portfolios.As banks demanded more collateral, the funds sold stocks. But many funds held the same stocks, including shares of companies known to be headed for a leveraged buyout, or others seen as targets for one.With no ability to sell risky loans or slices of collateralized debt obligations, the funds started dumping stocks they owned and buying back stocks they had borrowed.As a result, “high quality” or value stocks, plummeted while popular shorts — stocks that managers bet would fall in price — soared. This phenomenon ran counter to computer-driven or quantitative trading models, and created major losses in the first half of August in funds using those models, including some owned by Goldman Sachs, AQR Capital and D.E. Shaw.Rumors shook the marketplace about imminent doom for various hedge funds. Some funds facing extensive losses looked to secure additional liquidity.After steep losses in the first two weeks of August, three Goldman Sachs funds were severely under water. Its Global Equity Opportunities Fund fell 30 percent in one week; Global Alpha, a multi-strategy fund, doubled its losses in a week and ended last week down 27 percent, continuing an 18-month run of poor performance. The North American Equity Opportunities Fund was down more than 40 percent by Aug. 10, according to the HSBC Private Banking report.With redemption notices approaching, Goldman orchestrated a major injection of liquidity. On Monday, before the market opened, the investment bank said it would team with some prominent investors including Maurice R. Greenberg, the former chairman of the American International Group who now runs C.V. Starr, and Richard Perry of Perry Capital, to inject $3 billion into the Global Equity Opportunities Fund ($2 billion of the total came from Goldman).According to one investor, by the end of the week the Global Equity Opportunities fund faced “single digit” drawdowns from redemptions, suggesting that Goldman had, for the moment, dodged a bullet. (Investors are allowed to withdraw their money only once a month from the Global Equity fund, so the issue will arise again in mid-September). A spokesman declined to comment.“The winners will be those who have liquidity and can extend it to those who crave it,” said Alan H. Dorsey, alternative investment strategist at Lehman.But not everyone has access to capital. And when funds run into problems when liquidity is not available, investors can get nervous and run for the exits.At United Capital Asset Management, John Devaney, a well-known manager who is selling his yacht, the Positive Carry, said in early July that the fund had received an “unusually high number of redemption requests,” including one from its largest investor that accounted for nearly a quarter of the firm’s assets under management.As a result, he said, the firm suspended redemptions in several funds “in order to protect the interests of our investors.”Regulators have for years emphasized to banks, which they oversee, as well as to investment banks and hedge funds, which they do not, the importance of managing “liquidity risk,” or the risk that hedge funds or banks wake up one day and cannot sell or borrow.Yet those warnings often go unheeded. Long-Term Capital Management, for example, collapsed in the late 1990s when securities that the best computer models in the world predicted would not move in a certain direction did just that.More recently, executives have blamed very unusual events — known to experts as 25-standard deviation moves, things expected only every 100,000 years — for the disruptions that computers could not predict.And yet such unpredictable movements seem to pop up every few years. And when they do, they cause severe damage, even for big diversified funds with long track records.SAC Capital’s multistrategy fund is down 6 percent for August, one of its worst months ever, one investor said.Toward the end of the week, Tudor Investment’s Raptor Fund was down 7 percent for the year, and Highbridge Capital Management, owned by JPMorgan, was down 4 percent for the month at midweek and up 2.5 percent for the year. Representatives from those firms declined to comment.Waiting in the wings are the opportunists. Goldman Sachs, in spite of the abysmal performance of its major funds, is raising money for a fund to capitalize on assets that have been beaten down by fear, but whose fundamental value should spike when more normal markets reappear.It will be Goldman’s third Liquidity Partners fund: the first two were raised in 1998 and 2001, two other periods of extreme market conditions. According to a marketing document, Goldman will contribute 10 percent or up to $100 million and the fund will look for “tactical market opportunities” in fixed-income sectors rattled by dislocations.“Liquidity used to be opportunistic,” said Stewart R. Massey, of Massey Quick, a consulting firm. “Now it’s predatory. Many savvy investors are sitting on cash or lines of credit waiting to pounce on distressed sellers.”'"
"'07-08-20,'1','Lincoln Center seems to be taking a proactive approach to adding new works to the repertory, using Osvaldo Golijov’s “Pasión Según San Marcos” (2000) as its test case. This polystylistic Passion setting was the centerpiece of a Golijov festival here only last year. Now Mr. Golijov is back as the first (living) composer in residence at the Mostly Mozart Festival, and “Pasión” was given two more performances, Saturday and yesterday at the Rose Theater. It is clearly a good risk. The capacity audience on Saturday evening loved it enough to give it an extended standing ovation.The work’s attractions are clear. Set mostly in Spanish, it draws heavily on the rhythms and timbres of Latin American folk and popular styles — from tactile, polyrhythmic drumming to the blaring brass of salsa — and has an earthy, visceral appeal that speaks to listeners whose musical interests are not bounded by the traditions of the classical concert hall. And it offers surprises from this other world: A powerful choral setting of lines from Psalms 113 to 118 is based on a song by the Argentine pop composer and singer Víctor Heredia.But if Latin pop gives the work its principal accent and patina, other influences drive it too. A recurring string theme has the spiky contours and repetitiveness of a Steve Reich figure. More acerbic, tonally ambiguous writing, similar to that of Mr. Golijov’s early chamber music, is also heard. The choral writing, though often robustly folksy, occasionally takes on traditional classical hues, and in the Eucharist section its contours are those of Gregorian chant.It would be easy to charge Mr. Golijov with opportunism, but he comes by his eclecticism honestly. The Latin elements expand on music he heard growing up in Argentina. The rest comes from the arsenal of any formally trained composer. And culture-crossing sacred settings have a history. Some of the ebulliently folk-tinged choral writing calls to mind works like Ariel Ramírez’s “Missa Criolla” and Guido Haazen’s “Missa Luba,” or any number of folk Masses. And Mr. Golijov composed this work around the same time John Adams wrote “El Niño,” his similarly Latin-tinged Christmas oratorio.Like Mr. Adams, Mr. Golijov moves beyond biblical texts to create an essentially dramatic piece. It includes a few dances, executed athletically by Reynaldo González Fernández. One highlight is an almost operatic setting of a Rosalía de Castro poem, “Lúa Descolorida” (“Colorless Moon”), sung ravishingly by Jessica Rivera. And the moving finale is a swirl of Spanish, Latin, Hebrew and Aramaic texts, including the Kaddish, the Jewish prayer for the dead, in a musical setting that pulls the work’s folksy and formal musical strands toward a serene but emotionally charged closing “Amen.”Mr. Fernández and Luciana Souza offset Ms. Rivera’s polished style with gritty, soulful renderings of the more pop-tinged vocal writing. And Robert Spano, by now an old hand at this score, led the Orquesta la Pasión, the Schola Cantorum de Venezuela and the Holy Cross Passion Ensemble in a robust, driven performance that fully conveyed the spirit of this work’s many worlds.'"
"'07-08-20,'1','Business cards, it turns out, are indeed a messy undertaking. Ms. Nickel-Kailing and other industry analysts say that printers generally dislike such jobs because they are not lucrative. Most business cards are ordered in small batches, on cheap paper, and with little in the way of inventive designs.VistaPrint helped change the economics of the business in 1999 when it used a new approach to printing the cards. Traditionally, printers would produce business cards in distinct batches for each client, with a person’s card printed 143 times on a single sheet of paper.VistaPrint created software that allows it to print 143 different cards on each sheet, then print those sheets in large quantities.“Ganging up” orders, as the technique is known, is not necessarily difficult, but grouping similar orders efficiently is: in one batch, customers may want a specific paper stock or color combination, while in another batch, the card size may be different. VistaPrint’s software can group similar batches together efficiently.The company’s approach is so automated that each batch printed of material requires less than 60 seconds of human involvement.The low-touch approach is partly why VistaPrint charges an average of about $40 for an order of 1,000 business cards, compared with roughly $80 at most print shops. Consumers have responded, handing VistaPrint a large majority of the online business card industry, analysts said.Last month, VistaPrint announced a net income of $27 million for its 2007 fiscal year, up 41 percent from 2006, on revenue of $256 million. The company said that it had attracted 3 million new customers during the year and processed an average of 22,000 orders a day in the three months ended June 30.The deal with OfficeMax is an important defensive measure, said Robert Keane, VistaPrint’s chief executive. “We think it makes sense to partner with other people who have access to millions of customers, and help them be the second, third and fourth competitors in the market,” he said. “I’d rather have the market dominated by firms that are VistaPrint in different guises.”OfficeMax is adding a human element to the VistaPrint approach. Ryan Vero, OfficeMax’s chief merchandising officer, said that in tests this year, the VistaPrint stations at stores improved customer satisfaction with the process of buying business marketing materials.That is no small thing, Mr. Vero said, since business cards in particular can be the first step in building a long-term relationship with a customer.OfficeMax’s competitors have been quick to respond. Last week, Staples announced it had struck a deal with Hewlett-Packard to offer a similar service. Instead of ordering cards that are delivered later, however, Staples customers can have them printed in 30 minutes. The service relies on technology from Logoworks, an online logo design company that Hewlett-Packard bought this year and that also has an in-store printing deal with Office Depot.Other companies have gone after the business-card niche recently, with varying degrees of success. Last year Eastman Kodak introduced Kodak Creative Network, a site aimed at small businesses that let people place photographs on their business cards and stationery. Last week, though, Kodak closed the site, sending customers to the Kodak Gallery (KodakGallery.com), which is aimed at the general consumer.Of all the major office supply and printing companies, FedEx Kinko’s has spent the most time and money on the online printing category, said Ms. Nickel-Kailing, the consultant. Those efforts, she said, have yielded little success, but according to Tom Leverton, a FedEx Kinko’s executive vice president, the company has been turning a corner.In November, FedEx Kinko’s introduced Print Online, which allows customers to upload a file to the Web, specify how they would like it printed, view a proof of the document and then send it to a FedEx Kinko’s location for printing.Mr. Leverton declined to say how many customers have used the system, but he said it had seen “tremendous month-over-month growth since its launch.”'"

"'07-08-21,'0','His attempts to buy the London market were rejected by Clara Furse, London’s chief executive, who repeatedly refused to meet with Mr. Greifeld, arguing that her exchange, one of the biggest in Europe, was better off on its own.The battle left Mr. Greifeld with a battered reputation and a minority stake in the L.S.E. that did not give him a board seat and will be diluted once the London market completes its takeover of the Borsa Italiana.Nasdaq said it would look for a buyer for its 31 percent stake in the London market and use about $1 billion of the proceeds to retire debt and the rest to buy back shares. The sale will increase earnings per share by as much as 35 cents next year.In New York trading Monday, shares of the Nasdaq Stock Market rose initially, then fell back to close at $31.52, down 23 cents, rising again in after-hours dealing. Shares of the London Stock Exchange gained 2.4 percent here. Nasdaq owns 61.3 million shares of the London market, which are valued around £797 million ($1.58 billion).Nasdaq, which is based in New York, said it was selling the stake because its “current stock price didn’t adequately reflect the value of its stake in the L.S.E..”A spokesman for Nasdaq in London, William Clutterbuck, denied that the prospective sale had anything to do with its bid for OMX, but some analysts said Nasdaq was selling the stake to prepare for making a higher OMX offer.On May 25, Nasdaq offered 25.1 billion Swedish kronor ($3.7 billion at the time), or 208.1 kronor a share in cash and stock for OMX. On Friday, Borse Dubai surpassed that, offering 27.7 billion kronor, or 230 kronor a share, in cash. Mr. Greifeld said his exchange could afford to sweeten its offer.Stock markets around the world are combining or buying stakes in each other to meet clients’ demands to trade shares of companies anywhere, at a faster pace, across different asset classes and for less money. Combinations also help them save costs in an industry where the largest expense is developing the technology to run trading platforms.An OMX spokeswoman, Heidi Wendt, said her company’s chairman, Urban Backstrom, considered the Borse Dubai bid to be hostile and to come from a company that did not value its board’s opinion. Mr. Backstrom learned of the approach by the Dubai exchange through reports over the Internet.Both Borse Dubai and Nasdaq are talking to OMX investors to gain support for their offers. So far, two of the largest OMX shareholders, Investor and Nordea Bank, have come out in favor of the Nasdaq offer.Mr. Greifeld said Monday that he expected to find a buyer for Nasdaq’s London stake within a month and to sell the stake at a premium to the current share price.'"

"'07-08-21,'0','The charges against him came at a time when the N.F.L. was confronted with a series of off-the-field incidents. The league suspended three players earlier this year for violating its new personal-conduct policy.Three of Vick’s co-defendants have pleaded guilty in the case, saying that Vick “almost exclusively funded” the enterprise, Bad Newz Kennels, and the gambling associated with it.One of the co-defendants, Quanis L. Phillips, said that he, Vick and another co-defendant, Purnell A. Peace, killed about eight dogs in April by hanging or drowning them at a property owned by Vick in Surry, Va. The dogs were killed because they did not perform well, he said.In a statement released Monday afternoon, the N.F.L. accused Vick of lying to Commissioner Roger Goodell and to the Falcons early in the investigation.“We are aware of Michael Vick’s decision to enter a guilty plea to the federal charges against him and accept responsibility for his conduct,” the N.F.L.’s statement said.“We totally condemn the conduct outlined in the charges, which is inconsistent with what Michael Vick previously told both our office and the Falcons. We will conclude our own review under the league’s personal conduct policy as soon as possible.”Vick’s lawyers said they hoped Vick would be able to resume his football career.“Watching Michael Vick go through this, even for a lawyer with my experience on these types of cases, is very painful,” Billy Martin, one of his defense lawyers, said in a telephone interview. “We find a young man in a predicament that should never have happened.“Michael is in the process of trying to heal himself and his family. We understand Judge Hudson has the matter in his hands, and we are hopeful that he will allow him to continue to do the only profession he knows and give him a second chance to come back into the N.F.L.”Goodell is expected to review the details of the plea deal when they are released next week, paying special attention to Vick’s involvement in gambling. Gambling is prohibited by the league’s personal-conduct policy. Violating those rules could subject Vick to a lifetime suspension.The N.F.L. has also instructed the Falcons not to take action against Vick until Goodell makes his decision.Vick will probably be suspended by the N.F.L. indefinitely, with the league waiting to determine the final length of his suspension.That would keep Vick out of football for at least the 2007 season while he awaits sentencing, but would also give the N.F.L. the option of having Vick serve part of his suspension after his prison term ends. After an N.F.L. suspends, the Falcons would be free to try to collect a portion of Vick’s $37 million signing bonus — which could top $20 million — because he would be in breach of his contract. The Falcons then could release Vick, whom they signed to a 10-year, $130 million contract in 2004.“We are certainly troubled with the news today concerning Michael Vick’s guilty plea to federal charges,” the Falcons said in a statement.A yearlong prison term would probably rule Vick out for the 2007 and 2008 seasons. If the N.F.L. decides that Vick should continue to serve his suspension after his incarceration ends, he will probably not be free to return to action until at least 2010, when he will be 30 and still have plenty of playing time left.The Falcons’ owner, Arthur Blank, has made it clear that he feels betrayed by Vick, a strong indication that even if Vick were able to resurrect his career, it would not be in Atlanta.Frank Beamer, Vick’s coach at Virginia Tech, showed support for him Monday in a written statement: “I, like all people who know and care about Michael Vick, was very disappointed and saddened by the news. Although all the details are not known at this time, I am greatly concerned that Michael has put himself in this position.”It was only six months ago that Vick was in the midst of adjusting to a new head coach, the former Louisville coach Bobby Petrino, who was supposed to hone Vick’s athleticism into more consistent play.But in April, the government raided his property in Surry and found 52 pit bulls, blood-soaked carpeting and 5 specially modified treadmills for dogs. On July 17, Vick was indicted with Peace, Phillips and Tony Taylor, another former associate.Taylor pleaded guilty and agreed to cooperate with prosecutors July 30. Peace and Phillips accepted their plea deals Friday.The charges in Vick’s indictment carry a maximum possible sentence of five years in prison and a $250,000 fine. The plea deal probably calls for prosecutors to recommend a lighter sentence as long as Vick cooperates with the government’s investigation.'"
"'07-08-21,'0','It was an unusual juxtaposition for Mrs. Clinton, who has weathered criticism from some Democrats for initially supporting the war. In her appearance here on Monday, though, it was her opposition to the war that was at odds with the views of many people seated in the crowd.Still, she devoted only a small part of a 41-minute speech specifically to the mission in Iraq, instead detailing legislation she has introduced to improve services for military veterans. She received no jeers when she called for a gradual withdrawal of troops from Iraq, but the downtown convention center was nearly silent.“There is a vigorous debate in our own nation and probably among many of you about the right way forward in Iraq,” Mrs. Clinton said. “I know we may disagree about whether there is or isn’t a military solution to this war.”At this stage of a presidential race, candidates spend nearly all their time courting voters in their own party. So the appearance here before hundreds of veterans, many of whom vigorously support the war, offers a glimpse of the challenges ahead for whoever wins the presidential nomination.Aides to Mrs. Clinton said her remarks that military tactics in Iraq are “working” referred specifically to reports of increased cooperation from Sunnis leading to greater success against insurgents in Al Anbar Province. Looking ahead to September, when Congress will receive an Iraq progress report, Mrs. Clinton said: “We will have some very hard decisions to make. I’m not sure there are any good options.”The organization of military veterans invited four presidential candidates to its annual summer meeting. Senator Barack Obama, Democrat of Illinois, and Fred D. Thompson, a Republican, are scheduled to address the assembly on Tuesday. President Bush will speak here on Wednesday.Mr. McCain, a forceful advocate of the Iraq strategy, offered an opposing view when he took the stage shortly after Mrs. Clinton. He said it was in the best interest of the United States to stay in Iraq.“As long as there is a prospect for not losing this war,” he said, “then we must not choose to lose it.”Mr. McCain’s speech was interrupted by friendly applause from people seated throughout the hall. When Mrs. Clinton spoke, applause often was started by three young people in the middle of the room who were not wearing the trademark blue V.F.W. cap or convention name badges. But when she finished her speech, she walked onto the convention center floor and shook hands and posed for photographs for several minutes. The Veterans of Foreign Wars, the country’s oldest and largest organization of combat veterans, has a membership of 2.3 million. A survey released by the organization’s internal magazine found that 91 percent of veterans voted in presidential races.“We’re divided, just like the country,” said D. E. Sears, 77, who traveled here from Idaho with his wife, Mary. “In my lifetime, and I’m getting up there near 80, we want to see a lady as president of the United States.”Joe LaPadula, 76, who came here from Nebraska, stayed in his seat when Mrs. Clinton finished speaking. At the end of Mr. McCain’s remarks, though, he rushed up to shake the candidate’s hand. The war in Iraq, Mr. LaPadula said, is a defining issue in the presidential campaign.“There is only one future for us in Iraq,” Mr. LaPadula said. “We have to succeed in order to protect our future and a strong America.”'"
"'07-08-21,'0','Aides to Mr. Cuomo said the investigation had already found evidence of significant fraud among the training schools and the roughly 1,000 vendor companies that link the schools’ graduates with the agencies. That part of the investigation began with tips from three anonymous sources about two vendors based in New York City. Based on those tips, law enforcement officials arrested managers, nurses and more than 20 health aides associated with one of the vendors, Borina Home Care Inc., on criminal and civil charges last December.That and subsequent investigations uncovered a variety of abuses, a Cuomo aide said. Some of the training schools sold home health aide certification to individuals with no training. Under state law, home health aides must go through 75 hours of training at a school and 16 hours of practical training with a registered nurse. Some aides received no-show jobs but later caused Medicaid to be billed for their services. One vendor hired marketers to identify individuals who would qualify for home health services paid by Medicaid, the aide said, and then split any Medicaid billings for those individuals with the marketer.It was unclear on Monday whether the investigation had unearthed any cases in which patients were harmed as a result of the fraud, but the Cuomo aide said investigators believed the potential for such harm was high. Aspects of the investigation were reported in The New York Post on Monday.The Cuomo aide declined to name other vendors and schools under Mr. Cuomo’s microscope, saying it might compromise investigations that were at various stages. The attorney general’s office expects to recover as much as $100 million in fraudulent Medicaid billing when the investigation is concluded, the aide said.Under an agreement reached with federal officials in 2006, New York must recover $1.6 billion worth of fraudulent Medicaid dollars over five years to help qualify for hundreds of millions of dollars in federal financing.The president of the Home Care Association of New York State, a trade association for the agencies and the vendors who supply them with home aides, said that the association supported Mr. Cuomo’s efforts to uncover fraud but that there was a danger that investigators would “inadvertently characterize nonfraudulent activities as fraud.”“Last year’s budget deal certainly has put incredible pressure on the state to recover Medicaid dollars under the auspices of fraud,” said the association’s president, Joanne Cunningham.Home health care is a fast-growing segment of the health care industry, as federal and state officials seek to reduce health spending by providing care to elderly patients in their own homes rather than at institutions. In New York City, Medicaid spending on home health care aides totaled $1.3 billion last year. About 54,000 city residents receive some sort of Medicaid-financed home health services, from help getting dressed in the morning to dressing wounds and other kinds of care.The agencies and their vendors are certified by the state’s Department of Health, which also certifies the schools that train aides. But the schools themselves certify the aides as having completed the required training. Because there is no central registry for those certifications, state officials do not know how many home health aides are working in the state at any given time.'"
"'07-08-21,'0','“Farmers are required to validate the legal status of their workers, which they do,” said Peter Gregg, a spokesman for the New York Apple Association, a nonprofit group representing more than 670 commercial apple growers in the state. “But a lot of times the paperwork is false, so they’re unwittingly or unknowingly hiring workers who are here illegally. And then a raid will occur, and all of a sudden their workers will leave.”For apple growers in New York, where the forces of nature and the market have at last come together in their favor, the potential fallout from the new immigration initiative is particularly unsettling. “We have three billion apples to pick this fall and every single one of them has to be picked by hand,” Mr. Gregg said. “It’s a very labor-intensive industry, and there is no local labor supply that we can draw from, as much as we try. No one locally really wants to pick apples for six weeks in the fall.”Mr. Crist, who was recently named apple grower of the year by a leading fruit industry magazine, lobbied in Washington for passage of a new guest-worker program. But the program was part of the overall immigration reform proposal that collapsed on the Senate floor in late June. Growers say that only 2 percent of farmworkers nationwide come from the current guest-worker program, which, they say, is plagued by red tape, low capacity and delays.Another Hudson Valley apple grower, Mark S. Roe, of Roe’s Orchards in Blooming Grove, will get five workers through the existing program for this fall’s harvest. He said he planned to hire about seven additional pickers. As for past workers, Mr. Roe said: “It’s hard to tell who’s legal and who’s not. They all have documents.”He, too, is worried about the tougher immigration rules and what they might mean for his 240-acre fruit and vegetable farm, which was started by his great-great-grandfather in 1827 and is still worked by his grown children, who represent the sixth generation of growers. “We need something better, something grower-friendly,” he said.So far, the Hudson Valley has not been subject to the federal raids that have rippled through farms and orchards in western New York, especially in the Buffalo area. “Last year, there were significantly more raids targeting agriculture in New York,” Mr. Gregg said. “A lot of growers lost numerous workers at the peak of the harvest. They had to scramble to try to find someone else. It was difficult. In a lot of cases, there were apples left hanging on the trees.”For now, both Mr. Crist and Mr. Roe say they have enough pickers for the initial harvest. Workers are now plucking Ginger Golds, one of the first varieties to ripen, and placing them in wooden bins that each hold 2,000 to 3,000 apples.A crew leader who for decades has recruited workers for Mr. Crist’s orchards said that if the current source of labor dried up there would be few other alternatives. The workers are mostly Hispanic men who pick citrus fruits in Florida and then move north for the apple harvest.Despite the labor concerns, growers seem to be optimistic, having emerged from the stretch of growing seasons that were devastated by storms and wild swings in temperature.“Five or six years ago, we were ready to wrap up our affairs,” said Mr. Crist, who owns six orchards, totaling 600 acres, in Orange and Ulster Counties. “It looked pretty dismal, and a number of growers either chose to get out or they had to get out. There are less of us today than there used to be. But we’re back on solid footing.”In the past two decades, the number of farms in Ulster County, the second-highest apple-producing county in the state, behind Wayne County, has steadily declined, according to Michael J. Fargione, an educator with Cornell Cooperative Extension, which provides research information and educational programs to farmers. In 1985, 104 farms covered 11,629 acres in Ulster County. By 1996, the number had slid to 63 orchards on 8,632 acres. And by 2001, the most recent year for which figures are available, there were 56 apple orchards on 5,669 acres.But growers and agriculture experts say that in recent years fewer orchards in the Hudson Valley seem to have fallen to housing developers. “My impression is that over the last three years, the decline has either stabilized or at least reduced its rate,” Mr. Fargione said.Mr. Roe, whose farm stand was awash in the rosy hues of just-picked peaches and plums, said his family had no intention of selling. Indeed, the weather this season — with ample rain and sunshine — seems to have strengthened his zest for farming.“It’s been practically perfect,” he said. “It’s just one of those things you hope for and dream about, and it rarely happens.”'"
"'07-08-21,'0','The New Jersey education commissioner, Lucille E. Davy, yesterday defended the state’s new monitoring system for school districts, disputing an audit last week that found the Education Department lacked the staff and resources to carry out its increased oversight responsibilities.Ms. Davy said she was redeploying the department’s 690 employees and filling about a dozen vacancies in 21 county offices that will work directly with the school districts to address problems cited in the monitoring reports. In addition, department workers will receive additional training to assist the districts better, she said.“We’re taking this process very seriously,” Ms. Davy said during a telephone conference with reporters yesterday to release the latest batch of monitoring reports for seven districts, including Atlantic City, Elizabeth and Plainfield. “I’m not sure in the past how committed the department was to doing the kind of reviews we’re now doing,” she said.On Friday, state education officials released an audit conducted in May and June at the behest of the Legislature. The audit, by the consulting firm KPMG, was intended to evaluate the department’s ability to carry out the new monitoring system and other responsibilities it has been recently charged with.The Education Department began rolling out the new monitoring system, known as the New Jersey Quality Single Accountability Continuum, in 2006 after spending more than a year consulting with superintendents, school boards and teachers’ unions, among others, to develop an evaluation system that would combine existing state and federal standards into one streamlined process.'"
"'07-08-21,'0','In yet another casualty of the fallout in the mortgage industry, the Capital One Financial Corporation said yesterday that it would stop making residential mortgages and close GreenPoint Mortgage, its wholesale mortgage banking unit.As part of this decision, about 1,900 employees will be laid off, most of them by the end of the year. The company will also close GreenPoint’s headquarters in Novato, Calif., along with 31 locations in 19 states.Capital One acquired GreenPoint as part of its purchase in December of the North Fork Bancorporation. During the first six months of 2007, GreenPoint was the 23rd largest mortgage company after making $12.3 billion in loans, a 30 percent drop from the period a year ago, according to Inside Mortgage Finance, a trade publication.Although GreenPoint declined to comment, it said in a news release that it would stop making new loan commitments immediately but that it would continue to meets contractual obligations to customers for loan commitments that are in the pipeline with rates locked.The chief executive of Capital One, Richard D. Fairbank, said that GreenPoint had made a valiant effort to “weather the challenges currently facing the mortgage industry. However the market disruption is too great to continue with GreenPoint’s originate-and-sell business model.”Capital One said that the total after-tax charge associated with the move would be roughly $860 million, or $2.15 a share, a charge that would largely be taken this year.'"
"'07-08-21,'0','I have been lucky to experience ways to keep frequent flying interesting, even if there are no complimentary peanuts being handed out.As a Getty Images photographer for the past five years, I have participated in some of the best entertainment events around the world. I fly at least twice a month, and sometimes I’m gone for a week or so at a time.Although I have mastered the art of packing for any eventuality and working out a system to keep my camera out of harm’s way (I never let it out of my sight during a flight), I do seem to have some trouble with my laptop. That’s problematic since I store photos on the computer.On a recent trip to Gibraltar, I left the laptop, which contained a week’s worth of pictures, on the check-in counter. Once when I was flying to Nashville, my laptop was stolen from my luggage. Both times I was frantic. But thanks to some great security people, I did get my laptop back, both times, with the images intact.What makes flying so much fun is that I often don’t even know where I’m going until I get to the airport. For a shoot of the musical group Destiny’s Child, I had no idea where I would end up because everything was top secret. I was instructed to take a commercial flight to Belize and was told a private pilot would meet me and take me to a private island to shoot a session with the group. I don’t know if I could ever find that island again. But I got some great shots.'"

By definition, our marketplace can’t fit into a single room. So we began streaming our launch events via the Web.“Lo and behold, when we counted our Web audience, the numbers were staggering — we were reaching 100,000’s of people. So we took the money we were otherwise spending on launch events in luxury hotels, and moved it to improve the global Web experience — the chandeliers weren’t quite as fancy, but we wanted the audience focused on content, not crystal.”GOVERNMENT AID (I) Yes, of course, if you want a quick laugh all you have to say is, “I am from the government and I am here to help you.”And no, we haven’t met too many entrepreneurial government officials.Still, the Small Business Administration Web’s site (www.sba.gov/) is worth a look, especially if you are just starting out or need a refresher course on the fundamentals.The information for the most part is basic, but thorough. (For example, in the section on writing a business plan, you’ll read: “Getting out of your business may not be important to you at this point. However, planning your exit strategy often involves more than just closing down.”)And if you need inspiration, there is an entire section on success stories.GOVERNMENT AID (II) Who knew you might want to willingly interact with the Internal Revenue Service?Not only does the I.R.S. offer a self-directed workshop “designed to help new and existing small-business owners understand and meet tax obligations” (www.irs.gov/businesses/small/article/0,,id=97726,00.html), but its Web site has countless links to other federal and state agencies that could prove helpful when it comes to doing market research.COMMON WOES Many of the problems a small-business owner faces are unique to entrepreneurs, but this one isn’t: Just like big companies, odds are you are going to have problems finding good, qualified employees in coming years.Inc. explains why in its current issue (www.inc.com/magazine/20070801/boomer-benefits.html): “Over the next two decades, 78 million baby boomers will turn 65, the traditional retirement age,” and there are simply not enough younger workers to fill their spots.One way to reduce the severity of the problem is to try to get your older workers to stay on the job a bit longer.Clearly, wages and health benefits are important lures, but so are training, flexible work schedules, retirement planning and elder care assistance, the magazine says.LAST CALL Identify this market niche (the numbers come courtesy of O, The Oprah magazine) based on just these three clues:¶Total size: $38.5 billion in the United States, up from $21 billion a decade ago.¶Types of products available: spas, day care, dentures, organic food, massage and acupuncture.'"

It seems clear that the holders of these financially nonviable mortgages should bear some degree of responsibility.'"
"'07-08-21,'0','But Harvey Weinstein, the company’s co-chairman, said the slow rollout was the best way to nurture an unconventional, nonlinear movie like “I’m Not There,” in which the above-mentioned stars play Mr. Dylan at particular stages of his life. Shot in styles that correspond to each Dylan epoch, “I’m Not There” sometimes looks like “A Hard Day’s Night,” elsewhere like “McCabe and Mrs. Miller,” with Mr. Dylan’s life being imbued with mythic American qualities.“With a movie like this you have to build it,” said Mr. Weinstein, who founded the company with his brother, Bob, two years ago after an acrimonious split from the Walt Disney Company saw them relinquish control of Miramax. “I don’t think you can go out on 500 screens. The reason for Film Forum is you go where the best word of mouth is on the movie. I like the movie; I think it’s adventurous. The audience is going to have to work — work in a good way.”Mr. Weinstein said that a similar approach had worked for two of Miramax’s biggest successes. “Good Will Hunting” opened in New York and Los Angeles and eventually brought in nearly $140 million at the domestic box office, while “Chicago” began the same way and grossed $170 million. Those films had larger openings, however: “Good Will Hunting” (with the rising stars Ben Affleck and Matt Damon) in 7 theaters, “Chicago” in 77.“I’m not saying this movie’s going to come anywhere near those,” Mr. Weinstein said, “but I have a tendency to start small and go big. If we threw this movie out wide, I don’t know what it would do. I think we have to start somewhere.”The “somewhere” means Film Forum, “a real cathedral of cinema” according to Mr. Haynes’s longtime producer, Christine Vachon, which has presented the premieres of work by Ingmar Bergman, Jean-Luc Godard, Hal Hartley, Claude Chabrol, Spike Lee and Lars von Trier, among many others. But rarely does it get star-laden films like “I’m Not There.” And for it to agree to have another theater share a New York premiere is a rare move.“We did it with ‘Saraband,’ ” said Karen Cooper, Film Forum’s director, referring to Mr. Bergman’s last American release. “Lincoln Plaza opened it the same day, and I don’t think either of us were happy. I thought the same crowd that lined up to see ‘Scenes From a Marriage’ would want to see ‘Scenes From a Divorce.’ I was wrong.”Ms. Cooper said that she was offered shared openings all the time and regularly turned them down. But she said that she and Mike Maggiore, Film Forum’s programmer and publicist, decided the Haynes film was so remarkable that they would not mind sharing it with Lincoln Plaza. In Los Angeles, “I’m Not There” will open at the Westside Pavilion and ArcLight Cinemas.Conventional movie-business wisdom says that if a film fails to catch fire at its opening theater, it will not move much farther. But Mr. Weinstein said there was “not a chance” he would not take this film into more theaters and cities, regardless of its fate on the coasts. “I’m going to play every major city in the United States with this movie,” he said. “I’ll play 100 cities, at least.”He said he also planned to position Ms. Blanchett, who plays Mr. Dylan during his “Blonde on Blonde” phase, for an Oscar. (Mr. Bale corresponds to “The Freewheelin’ Bob Dylan,” Mr. Ledger to “John Wesley Harding.”)“I may be jumping the gun,” Mr. Weinstein said, “but if Cate Blanchett doesn’t get nominated, I’ll shoot myself.”Films considered Oscar-worthy are released in various ways. Last year, Pedro Almodóvar’s “Volver” and its star, Penélope Cruz, were seen as possible contenders, but Sony Pictures Classics opened the film in only six theaters. (It ultimately grossed close to $13 million.) Another nominee-to-be, “Pan’s Labyrinth,” opened on 17 screens. It has made approximately $37 million. Both those films, however, were in Spanish, and foreign-language films are a hard sell to the American moviegoer.“I’m Not There,” which will play at film festivals in Venice, Toronto and New York, is Mr. Haynes’s first movie since “Far From Heaven,” his critically acclaimed 2002 homage to the melodramas of Douglas Sirk. The film, which has Mr. Dylan’s blessing, is also, according to Ms. Vachon, his most expensive film, although she declined to divulge the amount. (“Far From Heaven” cost $13.5 million, according to boxofficemojo.com.)Though Mr. Haynes, who was unavailable for this article, has never had a major commercial success except for “Far From Heaven,” he has never suffered a lack of critical acclaim. His “Poison,” for example, won the Grand Jury Prize at the Sundance Film Festival in 1991, and “Far From Heaven” received four Academy Award nominations, including one for its star, Julianne Moore. But Mr. Weinstein said the decision to pick up “I’m Not There” was not purely about making money but about an obligation to have important movies distributed.“That’s the story of my life,” he said. “That’s exactly what I believe in. ‘I’m Not There’ and some of the tougher stuff — it’s not going to be ‘The Nanny Diaries,’ you know. But I’ve been very fortunate that what I’ve believed in has worked, and even when it doesn’t work, we make money in other areas to cover that. It is my responsibility and, more importantly, it’s my passion.”'"
"'07-08-21,'0','His attempts to buy the London market were rejected by Clara Furse, London’s chief executive, who repeatedly refused to meet with Mr. Greifeld, arguing that her exchange, one of the biggest in Europe, was better off on its own.The battle left Mr. Greifeld with a battered reputation and a minority stake in the L.S.E. that did not give him a board seat and will be diluted once the London market completes its takeover of the Borsa Italiana.Nasdaq said it would look for a buyer for its 31 percent stake in the London market and use about $1 billion of the proceeds to retire debt and the rest to buy back shares. The sale will increase earnings per share by as much as 35 cents next year.In New York trading Monday, shares of the Nasdaq Stock Market rose initially, then fell back to close at $31.52, down 23 cents, rising again in after-hours dealing. Shares of the London Stock Exchange gained 2.4 percent here. Nasdaq owns 61.3 million shares of the London market, which are valued around £797 million ($1.58 billion).Nasdaq, which is based in New York, said it was selling the stake because its “current stock price didn’t adequately reflect the value of its stake in the L.S.E..”A spokesman for Nasdaq in London, William Clutterbuck, denied that the prospective sale had anything to do with its bid for OMX, but some analysts said Nasdaq was selling the stake to prepare for making a higher OMX offer.On May 25, Nasdaq offered 25.1 billion Swedish kronor ($3.7 billion at the time), or 208.1 kronor a share in cash and stock for OMX. On Friday, Borse Dubai surpassed that, offering 27.7 billion kronor, or 230 kronor a share, in cash. Mr. Greifeld said his exchange could afford to sweeten its offer.Stock markets around the world are combining or buying stakes in each other to meet clients’ demands to trade shares of companies anywhere, at a faster pace, across different asset classes and for less money. Combinations also help them save costs in an industry where the largest expense is developing the technology to run trading platforms.An OMX spokeswoman, Heidi Wendt, said her company’s chairman, Urban Backstrom, considered the Borse Dubai bid to be hostile and to come from a company that did not value its board’s opinion. Mr. Backstrom learned of the approach by the Dubai exchange through reports over the Internet.Both Borse Dubai and Nasdaq are talking to OMX investors to gain support for their offers. So far, two of the largest OMX shareholders, Investor and Nordea Bank, have come out in favor of the Nasdaq offer.Mr. Greifeld said Monday that he expected to find a buyer for Nasdaq’s London stake within a month and to sell the stake at a premium to the current share price.'"
"'07-08-21,'0','In fact, how people cope with the suspension seems to reflect the evolution of Russian attitudes. Younger Muscovites, who are less familiar with the hardships of the past and are as comfortable with Nokia and Pizza Hut as their peers in suburban New Jersey, seem far less forgiving.The older generation certainly complains, but seems more willing to shrug it off. After all, what are a few weeks without hot water, given everything else that has been weathered over the decades? This view may be especially prevalent in Moscow, the largest city in Europe, whose population has surged with an influx of people from hardscrabble regions.“We are all basically country folk,” said Lidiya Artyomova, 52, a maid. “We are used to this sort of thing, so there’s nothing to be done.”Ms. Artyomova was working the other day at an apartment building without hot water on Sadovaya-Karetnaya Street, in one of the city’s better neighborhoods. Soon after she spoke, up drove a resident, Roman Berezin, 25, a student with a dog in the back seat and a harsher view.“It’s very unpleasant,” Mr. Berezin said. “I like to take a shower twice a day, and without hot water, you end up going back and forth, back and forth, back and forth, carrying the water from the kitchen to the bathroom.”Of course, as under Communism, ways are devised to skirt the common misery. Some buildings, including hotels, install boilers, and some people put small water heaters in bathrooms — both are legal. But many cannot afford to do so, or live in dwellings whose plumbing and electricity cannot handle the equipment.Moscow is not alone in its summertime water woes. St. Petersburg and other Russian cities have similar systems. But it galls some Muscovites that a city of such power and money cannot provide a basic necessity year-round.“We often think about why the city cannot fix all the pipes,” said Aleksandr Savin, 38, another resident of the building on Sadovaya-Karetnaya Street, who runs a package delivery company. “How come they have to do this every year? And then there are the accidents, so they have to turn off the cold water sometimes, too.”Moscow officials acknowledge the system’s failings but note that they have been spending hundreds of millions of dollars in recent years on replacing pipes, some of which did not function all that well even when they were installed during Stalin’s rule.Irina Negazina, an official at the city agency that oversees the system, said she hoped that pipe replacements would be complete in as little as five years. At that point, the suspensions, which roll across Moscow as crews move from site to site, should be briefer, she said. They might last only a few days, she said, because only plants should require major repairs.Still, the feeling of frustration when the faucets run dry is widespread, as was captured by a prominent poet, Tatyana Shcherbina:They’ve turned off all the hot water, my liquid of love, my stream of words.I should complain to the people, but a scarf’s been thrown over my mouth.Like this, without moisture of life, I’ll dry out, along with the unwashed dishes, I’ll gather moss, a stone unturned, or perhaps be forgotten, lost in the grass.For now, with a respite a long way off, Russians, as always, find ways of getting by.“We pretend we are angry and complain about it mockingly, and sometimes we go to visit those friends who have hot water in their apartments,” said Dmitri Kuper, 39, a clothing designer with a fondness for tattoos and piercings who lives in the building on Sadovaya-Karetnaya Street. “I simply call my friends and tell them, ‘I am coming to see you, and I will have my towel with me!’ ”'"
"'07-08-21,'0','This year, China pledged $20 billion to finance trade and infrastructure across the continent over the next three years. In Zambia alone, China plans to invest $800 million in the next few years.From South Africa’s manganese mines to Niger’s uranium pits, from Sudan’s oil fields to Congo’s cobalt mines, China’s hunger for resources has been a shot in the arm, increasing revenues and helping push some of the world’s poorest countries further up the ladder of development.But China is also exporting huge volumes of finished, manufactured goods — T-shirts, flashlights, radios and socks, just to name a few — to those same countries, hampering Africa’s ability to make its own products and develop healthy, diverse economies.“Most of our countries have been independent for 35 to 50 years,” said Moeletsi Mbeki, a South African entrepreneur and a political analyst. “Yet they have failed to develop manufacturing for a variety of reasons, and for the Chinese that’s a huge opportunity. We are a very important market for China.”On the one hand, Chinese imports give Africans access to goods and amenities that developed countries take for granted but that most people here could not have dreamed of affording just a few years ago — cellular telephones, televisions, washing machines, refrigerators, computers. And cheaper prices on more basic items, like clothing, light bulbs and shoes, mean people have more money in their pockets.“There is no doubt China has been good for Zambia,” said Felix Mutati, Zambia’s minister of finance. “Why should we have a bad attitude toward the Chinese when they are doing all the right things? They are bringing investment, world-class technology, jobs, value addition. What more can you ask for?”But across Africa, and especially in the relatively robust economies of southern Africa, there are clear winners and losers. Textile mills and other factories here in Zambia have suffered and even closed as cheap Chinese goods flood the world market, eliminating jobs in a country that sorely needs them.The Chinese investment in copper mining here has left a trail of heartbreak and recrimination after one of the worst industrial accidents in Zambian history, a blast at a Chinese-owned explosives factory in Chambishi in 2005 that killed 46 people, most of them in their 20s.“Who is winning? The Chinese are, for sure,” said Michael Sata, a Zambian opposition politician who campaigned in last year’s presidential election on an anti-China platform. He lost, but with a surprisingly strong showing, and his party, the Patriotic Front, won many seats in local and parliamentary elections in Lusaka, the capital, and the Zambian industrial heartland, where China has made its biggest investments.“Their interest is exploiting us, just like everyone who came before,” he said. “They have simply come to take the place of the West as the new colonizers of Africa.”Officials at the Chinese Embassy in Lusaka did not respond to repeated requests to discuss the country’s role in Zambia. But Chinese diplomats across Africa and top officials in Beijing have emphasized the money and opportunity they bring to Africa. In Zambia, for example, government officials say that the Chinese are sending dozens of workers for training in China and that their investments will create thousands of high-wage jobs.Measured in some ways, Zambia’s economy is booming. Copper prices have soared from 75 cents a pound in January 2003 to more than $3 a pound this year, driven in large part by Chinese demand. That demand has pushed Zambia’s long-dormant copper mines into record production.China’s Nonferrous Metals Corporation, a state-owned company, purchased rights to develop a mine in Chambishi, in the heart of the copper belt, in 1998, and it plans to build factories in an export processing zone that will bring as many as 60,000 jobs, according to government officials.But China’s growing presence in global trade is wiping out thousands of jobs in countries with fledgling manufacturing sectors like Zambia and South Africa.Despite relatively low wages in many countries, African manufacturers find it very hard to compete, arguing that China’s currency policies undervalue the yuan and give Chinese exporters a huge advantage.Many industries in China also benefited at various points from subsidies and free or low-cost government financing, making their costs lower. Beyond that, there are major infrastructure problems in Africa, where industry struggles with inadequate roads and railways, and unreliable electricity and water supplies.“So who do you blame?” said Martyn J. Davies, director of the Center for Chinese Studies at Stellenbosch University in South Africa. “You can’t blame China for being too competitive. China is doing what every other emerging market is doing.”The textile and clothing industry, one of the engines China used to fuel its own economic expansion in the 1980s, has been particularly hard hit in Africa. For decades, African countries exported large quantities of clothes and textiles to developed countries under a trade agreement intended to protect European and American markets from competition from China and others, while encouraging exports from the world’s poorest nations. But the trade provision, the Agreement on Textiles and Clothing, expired in January 2005, putting these countries in direct export competition with China.Africa found itself once again on the losing end of globalization. If copper is Zambia’s bread and butter, manufacturing should have been its main meal — just as many economies across the globe have progressed from producers of raw materials to low-tech manufacturing and beyond, a well-trod path to development.Ms. Zimba, 40, a quality-control worker at the plant here who asked to be identified only by her common last name because she feared losing her termination benefits, first got a job at the factory in 1989, after moving to Kabwe from the depressed eastern region of the country with her brother.She earned a little less than $100 a month, as well as free health care and a pension, and a little three-room house in the workers’ compound. But since she lost her job, her family’s standard of living has plummeted. The water was turned off, and Ms. Zimba does not know where she will come up with next semester’s tuition for her 20-year-old daughter’s trade school.“We will see what God brings me,” Ms. Zimba said.For Ms. Zimba, the transition from salaried work to selling goods for pocket change in the market is a devastating setback to a grim fate she thought she had escaped — her mother was widowed when Ms. Zimba was 15 and reduced to selling in the market as well.“I am right back where I started,” Ms. Zimba said.As for the Chinese, she bitterly refers to them as “briefcase investors.”“They just fill their briefcases with our wealth and leave,” she said.Such anti-Chinese sentiment has been brewing here for several years. When China’s president, Hu Jintao, visited Zambia earlier this year he received the usual red carpet treatment from his Zambian host, President Levy Mwanawasa , but the reception from many ordinary Zambians was nasty. A trip to the site of China’s big new investment, Chambishi, had to be scuttled entirely because of fears of unrest, and the circumstances of the industrial disaster there are still not entirely understood.The mine at Chambishi had for decades been run by the government, and had limped along while copper prices slumped in the 1980s. When the Non-ferrous Metal Mining Group bought the rights to develop the mine in 1998, local residents cheered, hoping for new jobs.In 2003, Keegan Chibuye got one as a mechanic at the mine, a job he was grateful to have in a country where even skilled men like himself struggled to find work. Mr. Chibuye’s sister, Vennie, 27, also found work for the Chinese, as a computer specialist at an explosives factory on the mine’s grounds. Ms. Chibuye was the eldest of seven, and her parents had sent her to Britain at great expense, to a technical college in Derbyshire, where she earned a diploma in information technology. A brother, Mwape, got a job as a casual worker in the explosives factory, for a little more than a dollar a day, to save money for college.Keegan Chibuye said he had concerns about the way the Chinese managers were running the mine almost from the beginning. “They were careless,” he said. “Safety was not their priority. Everything was about productivity no matter what.”On April 20, 2005, Keegan Chibuye heard an ear-splitting boom that would shatter his world — a huge blast at the explosives factory.There was almost nothing left of Vennie and Mwape left to bury. Virtually all the bodies had been incinerated. Only fragments were buried just off the main road at the graveyard built by the Chinese owners — a finger, an ear, a bit of scalp. As the 46 headstones testify, most of the workers were young, born after 1980.Officials of the company that runs the mine did not respond to repeated telephone requests for an interview to talk about working conditions and safety at the mine. But at the Chinese workers’ compound in Chambishi, Han Yaping, who identified himself as the company’s human resources manager, said that the company hoped to help Zambia develop.“China works here in cooperation with Zambia,” Mr. Han said in English. “It is friendship.”Asked why the wages at the mine were lower than those paid by other companies, Mr. Han said that Zambian workers had limited skills and no experience with technology. By way of example, he said, a Chinese worker trying to remove a screw would use a screwdriver.“But a Zambian worker,” he continued with a chuckle, “he use his finger.”A look around the compound for Chinese workers illustrates why China is able to do business so profitably in Africa. While Western companies must provide relatively plush and private accommodations to attract expatriate workers, the Chinese employees at Chambishi live in barracks-like conditions, several to a room. A table for table tennis and a dusty soccer field are the only recreational facilities.Many African scholars and political leaders say Africa has no need for the colonial baggage and paternalism of the West, and they welcome the Chinese approach of cowboy capitalism. “Let the Chinese come,” said Mahamat Hassan Abakar, a lawyer in Chad, a former French colony in central Africa with deepening ties to China. “What Africa needs is investment. It needs partners. All of these years we have been tied to France. Look what it has brought us.”In South Africa, dozens of clothing and textile companies closed, according to trade organizations representing manufacturers. Tens of thousands of jobs were lost because of Chinese imports, and in response the government negotiated temporary voluntary restraints on some items.But Iqbal Meer-Sharma, deputy director of South Africa’s Department of Trade and Industry, said that the clothing industry was ultimately less valuable to South Africa than the other benefits of its growing relationship with China.“We’ve always known we have a dysfunctional relationship with the West,” Mr. Sharma said. “Now with China we have a relationship as equals. They don’t look down on us. They are not condescending.”In an era of ruthless global competition, Mr. Sharma said, Africa should stop trying to compete with China at what it does best — producing cheap goods for export — and find other ways to compete instead.In the meantime, many Africans are caught in limbo.Clarissa Fabrik, 19, lives at the edge of Atlantis, a depressed industrial town in South Africa’s Western Cape. She had hoped to earn an engineering degree, courtesy of the scholarship fund from her mother’s clothing workers’ union benefit package. But her mother’s factory closed, and now she is trying to teach herself basics from a textbook on industrial electronics when she is not at her retail job.“I don’t know what the future will bring,” she said.'"
"'07-08-21,'0','Supplements of the antioxidants beta carotene, vitamin C and vitamin E may be good for you, but a new study reports that they have no effect, either alone or in combination, in preventing heart attack, stroke or death among women at risk for cardiovascular disease.Researchers randomly assigned more than 8,000 women to take regular doses of vitamin E, vitamin C, beta carotene or placebos, and followed them for more than nine years. All the women, whose average age was 60, either had had cardiovascular disease or were at high risk for it. During the nine years, 1,450 women had a heart attack, a stroke or cardiac surgery, and there were 395 deaths from heart disease.Women in the vitamin E group had a slight decrease in disease compared with the placebo group, but it was not statistically significant. Neither beta carotene nor vitamin C had any statistically significant effect compared with placebo.Combinations of the antioxidants had no effect either, except for a slight reduction in stroke among those taking both vitamins C and E together. The study appears in the Aug. 13 issue of The Archives of Internal Medicine.“While the individual supplements may not decrease risk,” said Nancy R. Cook, the lead author and an associate professor of epidemiology at Harvard, “it does seem that diets high in fruits and vegetables that contain these antioxidants are helpful. It may be that we haven’t identified the particular nutrients or combinations of nutrients that might be beneficial.”'"
"'07-08-21,'0','Breast density and high levels of circulating sex hormones are independent risk factors for breast cancer in postmenopausal women, a new study finds.It is known that women who have denser breasts, breasts that have more connective tissue than fat, are at higher risk for breast cancer. It is also known that higher levels of circulating sex hormones put women at increased risk. But because the two often occur together, it has been unclear whether each is a risk by itself.Researchers studied 253 women who had breast cancer, comparing their breast density and levels of sex hormones with 520 women without the disease. After controlling for other factors, they found that when breast density was not considered, women in the highest quarter in circulating sex hormones had twice the risk of developing breast cancer as those in the lowest one-quarter.They also found that women in the highest one-quarter in density had four times the risk of those in the lowest quarter, without considering levels of sex hormones.Women with both the highest hormones and densest breasts had up to six times the risk.“Having dense breasts or high hormone levels doesn’t mean you’re going to get breast cancer,” said Celia Byrne, a co-author of the study and an assistant professor of epidemiology at Georgetown. “But screening is important, and maintaining lower weight can help keep hormone levels lower.”The report, in the Aug. 1 issue of The Journal of the National Cancer Institute, is based on a nine-year prospective study.'"
"'07-08-21,'0','Stock markets in Hong Kong and Shanghai soared with the government’s decision, outpacing most other Asian markets that also rose in response to the Federal Reserve’s decision on Friday to reduce an interest rate for short-term borrowing by banks.The Hang Seng index in Hong Kong jumped 5.93 percent, the most in nearly nine years, while the Hang Seng China Enterprises Index, which tracks mainland Chinese companies traded in Hong Kong, leaped 8.74 percent. The Shanghai A Share stock market climbed 5.34 percent.David Webb, a corporate governance specialist who is also a nonexecutive director of Hong Kong Exchanges, said that the new policy might not be good for stocks in Hong Kong and Shanghai in the future, however. With the steep rise in the Shanghai stock market over the last two years, essentially identical shares in mainland companies now sell for considerably more in Shanghai than in Hong Kong, and some mainland Chinese investors may now choose to buy the less expensive shares in Hong Kong instead, he said.If this produces a drop in the Shanghai market, the Hong Kong market could also fall because it has been dragged up by high valuations in Shanghai, Mr. Webb warned, speaking for himself and not for the stock exchange. “There’s this euphoria about the announcement, but I think it’s the wrong conclusion,” he said.The State Administration of Foreign Exchange characterized the new policy as a trial effort but did not specify how long it would last and did not say when it would begin. New Chinese economic policies are routinely described as trial moves, which makes it politically easier to revoke them if they fail; trial policies commonly become permanent.The agency released the text of a new regulatory proposal that it described as having been approved. The proposal allows Chinese citizens to open accounts at the Tianjin branch of the Bank of China, and then sell yuan and buy Hong Kong dollars without limit for the purpose of buying shares in Hong Kong.Chinese citizens will also be allowed to use their foreign currency savings to buy shares in Hong Kong, using the Tianjin branch.Tianjin, 60 miles from Beijing in northeastern China, is an industrial port that Beijing officials are trying to develop into a financial center to rival Hong Kong and Shanghai.The proposal authorizes other Bank of China branches nationwide to handle transactions on behalf of the Tianjin branch. The document was silent, however, on whether individuals would initially be required to open accounts in Tianjin in person.Chinese citizens will need to show their national identity cards and transactions will be monitored for signs of money laundering, the State Administration of Foreign Exchange cautioned. Previous regulations had allowed individuals to transfer up to $50,000 in a single day to Hong Kong on a limited basis. But transfers to securities companies in Hong Kong are banned, and large daily transfers close to the maximum amount could invite regulatory scrutiny until now, Stephen Green, an economist in the Shanghai office of Standard Chartered, said in a research note.“Although there are limits, this is a historic move in China’s capital account opening,” Mr. Green wrote.Certain Chinese investment funds are already allowed to purchase overseas stocks, but only after receiving special government approval.The new policy comes as China struggles to prevent the value of its currency, the yuan, from rising. Despite repeated complaints from the Bush administration and sometimes the European Union, the central bank has been buying dollars on a large scale and issuing yuan to pay for them; the central bank then sells bonds to the public in an attempt to sop up the extra yuan and try to keep them from feeding inflation.Prices have been rising lately, with the consumer price index up 5.6 percent last month from a year earlier. But most of the increase has been confined to food, especially pork.'"
"'07-08-21,'0','The researchers asked about when and how the men washed after intercourse at enrollment and 6, 12 and 24 months later, including whether they washed with or without cloths.Because of a slip-up, the researchers did not ask details of how the cleansing was done or directly about using soap, said Dr. Ronald H. Gray, a co-author from the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. Some soaps used in Africa are more irritating than those used elsewhere.Men who washed within three minutes had a 2.3 percent risk of H.I.V. infection compared with 0.4 percent among those who delayed washing for 10 or more minutes. The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases paid for the study.The washing analysis was a secondary part of a study undertaken to determine the effectiveness of male circumcision against H.I.V. infection. Earlier reports had shown that circumcision was protective.One message from the study, Dr. Gray said, “is that there ought to be a little time left for postcoital cuddling before you go and wash.”“Don’t just finish and jump out of bed,” he said.Dr. Makumbi and other AIDS experts said they did not know why the washing practice increased vulnerability to H.I.V. infection, but offered various explanations. One is that the acidity of vaginal secretions may impair the ability of the AIDS virus to survive on the penis. Delayed cleansing — and longer exposure to the vaginal secretions — may then reduce viral infectivity.Another is that use of water, which has a neutral pH, may encourage viral survival and possible infectivity.H.I.V. apparently needs to be in a fluid to cross the mucosa to infect cells, Dr. Gray said. If the H.I.V.-contaminated fluid dries, its infectivity may decrease. Adding water could resuspend H.I.V. to make it more infectious.The study findings are counterintuitive, said Dr. Merle A. Sande, an infectious diseases expert at the University of Washington in Seattle, and “show why you have to do the studies, because until you do them, you just don’t know.”Dr. Sande, who was not involved in the study, said, “There is still so much we don’t understand about the complex factors that influence H.I.V. transmission in the genital tract, but this important study will help.”He also is president of the Academic Alliance Foundation, a group that trains health workers to treat AIDS and other infectious diseases in Uganda.'"

"'07-08-22,'1','Mr. Cho’s rampage began at 7:15 a.m., when he shot two students dead in a dormitory. Campus police sent out an e-mail message to the college community two hours later. It was shortly after that that Mr. Cho entered a classroom building, chained it shut, and proceeded to kill 30 others before turning a weapon on himself.Some of the changes recommended in today’s report have already been put in place. For example, the university began using a new system in July called VT Alerts, which sends out text messages to individual cell phones concerning emergency situations.James A. Hyatt, the school’s executive vice president and chief operating officer, said that as of last week, about 12,500 students, staff members and others connected with the school had signed up for the service.The university already employs an emergency communication system that makes use of e-mail, an emergency web page, sirens and telephone trees to get information out about a crisis, he said.Mr. Hyatt led a committee that examined security on campus for the report. The panel made also recommended several other changes or improvements:¶Replacing the hardware on all perimeter doors of buildings. During his rampage, Mr. Cho chained several doors shut, which impeded efforts by law enforcement officials to stop him; hardware of different design might have made that difficult or impossible for Mr. Cho to do.¶Installing locks on the inside of classroom doors. That has already been done, officials said.¶Creating a system of electronic card-key entry to certain academic buildings around the clock. In the event of an emergency, the campus police could lock such buildings by remote control.¶Studying the feasibility of installing video surveillance cameras at key locations on the campus.¶Installing electronic message boards at busy places on campus to alert students and faculty to emergencies, with instructions about what to do.¶Creating an electronic “people locator system” for members of the university community to let concerned relatives, friends and colleagues receive updated information on their status during an emergency.Mr. Cho had a history of mental illness, and during his time at the school several people reported odd or dangerous behavior on his part to the authorities. Some of his professors said immediately after the incident that they tried to warn colleagues or their superiors about danger signs they saw in his writing assignments.They and others said they were frustrated that communication about his problems seemed be hampered by privacy concerns or by the fact that, because Mr. Cho was legally an adult, no one seemed to be responsible for what happened to him as he made his way through his college career at Virginia Tech.The committee made several findings concerning the way the university handles troubled students. They said, for instance, that “effective communication among units regarding at-risk students is essential.”They called for establishment of a “central university contact who has a comprehensive picture of distressed students who have been assessed by the system, clarifying policies for communicating with external agencies regarding acutely distressed students.”In addition to the university’s internal review, another panel appointed by the state governor is expected to release its own findings soon. A day after the shootings, the campus president asked Gov. Timothy M. Kaine to appoint a committee to examine the university’s response to the shooting and try to answer some of the questions about the gunman’s actions.That review panel will hold a closed meeting on Aug. 24 to discuss matters of confidentiality as it prepares to complete and submit its report to Governor Kaine, the panel’s Web site said.In their last news conference in April, the Virginia police said that they were no closer to determining why Mr. Cho committed the worst mass shooting in American history, killing 27 students and 5 faculty members and injuring dozens more.Investigators have said they had pored over hundreds of pieces of evidence, including computer hard drives, e-mail messages from the university’s servers and cellphone records, and had conducted interviews with students, faculty members and Mr. Cho’s family.Students returned to classes for the fall term on Monday, on a campus that is balancing between memory and recovery from the rampage four months ago.Although the shooting occurred before tuition deposits were due, there appeared to be no decline in the percentage of students accepting admission offers at the school.Of the 25 students who were injured in the shooting and survived, 19 were returning to classes this fall, Mark Owczarski, a university spokesman, said recently.'"
"'07-08-22,'1','Mr. Hamilton — the former congressman who helped lead the Iraq Study Group, which earlier this year recommended a dialogue with Iran — said Tuesday that his letter did not refer to the tensions between Iran and the United States, and instead framed the request in humanitarian and religious terms.The Bush administration, which has accused Iran of developing nuclear weapons and supplying weapons used to attack American troops in Iraq, has made no secret of its desire to see the mullahs ruling the Islamic Republic replaced. In response, the Iranian government has treated anyone with ties to the West, particularly academics, with suspicion.Mr. Hamilton said Ayatollah Khamenei’s response to his appeal, two paragraphs that he was summoned to the Iranian mission to the United Nations to receive, referred to improving America’s image in the region. It said the ayatollah had taken unspecified steps to resolve the “issue,” Mr. Hamilton said. Given that the various intelligence agencies and the judiciary all report to Mr. Khamenei, his intervention would have proved instrumental.Ms. Esfandiari’s mother had to post bail worth around $324,000, according to Iranian news reports. Ms. Esfandiari’s husband, Shaul Bakhash, said her mother had put up her apartment as collateral. She lives on the pension of her late husband, a retired civil servant, Mr. Bakhash said, and her apartment is all she owns. The Web site Baztab, run by the former head of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard, called the sum the average price of an apartment in Tehran.Reached by telephone, Ms. Esfandiari’s mother said only that her daughter was resting and would not elaborate.Bail in prominent cases — though often quite high in Iranian terms — has become more common, said Karim Sadjadpour, an Iranian analyst at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. An Iranian-Canadian academic released on significant bail last year was allowed to leave the country, for example, but has been closemouthed about his imprisonment because the deeds to his home and the home of his mother are being held as collateral.“Sometimes it is simply because keeping them in prison has become too politically expensive,” said Abbas Milani, the director of the Iranian studies program at Stanford University. “Sometimes they are finished with a person but don’t want to leave them completely out of their control.”Mr. Milani said that in jailing Ms. Esfandiari and the others, the Iranian regime had succeeded in intimidating the intellectual class, with many of them reluctant to attend any kind of conference abroad, while those living around the world with family members in Iran have become more circumspect. The overall affect has been to make American support and any interior soft revolution even more remote, he said. Iranian experts interviewed in the United States said the detention and intimidation of prominent intellectuals, artists and filmmakers, along with prohibiting them from traveling abroad even if they are dual nationals, has been far more extensive than has been reported.Ms. Esfandiari went to Iran last year to visit her mother, who has been ill. She was barred from leaving the country in December, and underwent months of interrogation before being jailed in May.In her television interview, Ms. Esfandiari said she was held in a large room with a window. “I could have air whenever I wanted, and the food was very good,” she said. “Recently I had access to newspapers and television. The gentlemen who interrogated me were extremely polite and respectful. They always asked if I was tired.” Mr. Bakhash said from Washington that he had spoken briefly to his wife on the telephone about an hour after her release, which came in the early evening Tehran time.“She said she had been ill and she had lost quite a bit of weight,” said Mr. Bakhash, a professor of history at George Mason University. “She sounded well and obviously delighted to be out of prison.”He added, “We keep our fingers crossed and hope that now they have released her from prison they will allow her to rejoin us in America.”In Tehran, Shirin Ebadi, the Nobel laureate who is Ms. Esfandiari’s lawyer, said it was unclear whether Ms. Esfandiari could leave Iran. “It depends on the judge,” Ms. Ebadi said.“She was innocent and was held for three months in solitary confinement,” she said.At the State Department, the acting spokesman, Gonzalo Gallegos, called for the release of all Americans, but would not elaborate on what steps the United States government was taking.A judiciary official said another Iranian-American scholar held since May, Kian Tajbakhsh, an urban planner with ties to the Open Society Institute, which is financed by George Soros, might be released on bail within days, the ISNA student news agency reported.However, his wife, Bahar Malek, said her husband had no such information. “I spoke to him today but he had no idea that he could be released,” she said. She visited her husband weekly and he was in good health, she said.The two academics were shown on nationwide television in Iran in July, the program suggesting that they had been part of a project to try to overthrow the Iranian government much like the “velvet revolutions” in former Soviet republics.Another American, Parnaz Azima, a reporter for the United States-funded Radio Farda, has not been allowed to leave Iran since earlier this year, when her family also posted their apartment as bail.The fourth American, Ali Shakeri, with the Center for Citizen Peacebuilding at the University of California, Irvine, remains in Evin prison. Last week a senior judiciary spokesman said his case was not linked to those of Ms. Esfandiari and Mr. Tajbakhsh.'"
"'07-08-22,'1','Mr. Majid and some of his 14 co-defendants adamantly protested their innocence as their trial began. At various points several lapsed into diatribes that prompted the Iraqi judge to cut them off. They are charged with four counts of crimes against humanity: willful murder, persecution, torture and what amounts to unjust imprisonment.Before sitting down in the front row of the dock among his co-defendants, Mr. Majid, his dark wooden cane in his right hand, walked meekly to his seat. He wore a white head scarf, known here as a ghutra, and a robe known as a dishdasha. He stood up once to address the judge, gesturing right and left but producing none of the verbal fireworks that Mr. Hussein spewed at his trial.Mr. Majid is accused of being one of the leaders of the brutal suppression of the uprising, which occurred as Iraqi armed forces engaged in a chaotic retreat from Kuwait after Mr. Hussein’s forces were routed by a coalition led by the United States. As many Shiites vividly recall, the mass killings were at least partly made possible because of the decision by the United States not to intervene.Trials relating to the suppression have been divided into parts, and this one covers only accused crimes in the southern provinces of Basra and Amara. A United States official at the trial said that the division had been done to reduce the number of witnesses who needed to be transported from the south for any one trial.The court heard a witness, Khuraibu Jabbar Rissan, provide a detailed description of the chaos and brutality of the suppression of Shiites in the south. When young men of the village, in the marshes near Basra, heard that officials had abandoned their posts, they marched on the police station and the Baath Party headquarters, Mr. Rissan said.The buildings were abandoned and the young men burned them down, he said. Mr. Rissan, who was in the army at some point, heard that the military would march on his village and fled to an abandoned school in another town with his family. Soon thereafter, they fled into the marshes to escape the assault.When he finally returned to the village, he said, it had been largely destroyed and looted by members of the Iraqi Army, Mr. Hussein’s Republican Guard and the local Baath Party. His clothing shop was destroyed, rounds had been fired into his house and everything was missing except for two old sofas and a worn carpet.The trial is taking place at the Iraqi High Tribunal, which was created to try crimes committed during Mr. Hussein’s government. An organization run by the American Embassy and called the Regime Crimes Liaison Unit has largely organized the trial in the past. But on Tuesday, it has for the first time left many of those duties to the Iraqi government, said Armand Cucciniello, an embassy spokesman.Mr. Majid, a cousin of Mr. Hussein, is the most recognizable defendant left in the trials. But his earlier convictions are under appeal, and he could be hanged at any time for those crimes. The appeal process in Iraq generally takes no more than 30 days, and once a defendant in a capital case loses an appeal, the sentence is carried out almost immediately.He and some of the other defendants in the trial focused on what is likely to be a central issue, involving the creation, in February 1991, of an operational army headquarters in Basra.Sultan Hashim, a defendant who had been a senior military official, blamed the attacks on the civilian government and intelligence services and security forces in Basra. “The army had nothing to do with these forces,” Mr. Hashim said.That argument did little to assuage those who were directly affected by the events of 1991.“Giving those people the death sentence is less than what they really deserve,” said Abu Ahmad, a laborer in Karbala who was arrested and put in prison in 1991.'"
"'07-08-22,'1','“We were shocked that the subject was even brought up,” a spokesman for the agency said late Tuesday. “M.S.H.A. remains 100 percent focused on the rescue effort.”The suggestion that the mine might reopen inflamed the emotions of the families of the trapped miners. They questioned how the mine could be safe enough for work but not for rescuing their relatives.The rescue effort was stopped Thursday after an access tunnel caved in, killing two miners and a federal mine safety employee performing rescue work.“They just don’t believe that they’re gone,” said Sonny J. Olsen, a lawyer from Price who is a spokesman for the families. “And if they seal that mine up, they’ll never know if these people died from a lack of food, water or oxygen. They just won’t know.”Other people, torn between safety concerns and the desire to earn a living in the sole major industry here, said they would choose a paycheck, despite their grief.“I can’t leave, to do what?” said Brendan Jones, a miner who is a nephew of Dale Black, a miner killed in the unsuccessful rescue attempt who was buried Tuesday. “The coal mine or the power plant is your baseline income here.”Outside a memorial service for Mr. Black on Monday night, Mr. Jones’s father, Russell, a semiretired miner, recalled that even before this disaster he had begged his son not to go into coal mining.“It’s just dangerous,” Russell Jones said. “You don’t want to have your kids go in there.”Others who had worked in the mine said they had felt safe and would work there again. Jim Hanna has worked as a supervisor at the mine.“I would have been going in that Monday morning,” said Mr. Hanna, who was on leave because of a back injury. “I’ve never seen anything like this. It tears me up.”But Mr. Hanna said he would be back at work as soon as his back improved.“That’s just coal miners,” he said.Amanda Hight, a graduate student in Price, said if the mine remained closed, “then you have a ghost town.”“It’s tricky,” Ms. Hight said, “because there are people’s jobs at stake.”Hundreds of people turned out for the funeral of Mr. Black, the first of the killed rescuers to be buried. Crowds also attended a wake for him on Monday.The line to pay respects at the wake stretched outside the funeral home, down an alley and into the parking lot. Young and old, friends and strangers, stood together in the baking hot sun.Relatives of the trapped miners mingled conspicuously with the crowd. Lacking the certainty that would allow a wake or a funeral, they were among the most emotionally broken.Bodee Allred, a cousin of a trapped miner, Kerry Allred, was in tears and could barely speak. As Mr. Allred left the service on Monday night, one after another in the crowd reached out to embrace him.“He needs to go home now,” another relative said. “This is just too hard.”Through Mr. Olsen, the spokesman, family members of the trapped miners relayed their disappointment with the decision to give up on the men and leave them entombed.“These are hearty miners,” Mr. Olsen said. “The conditions there — they have water, we know that. They may not have safe oxygen. But they could have barricaded themselves in a safe area and could be O.K.“That’s the thing we don’t know. We haven’t seen any evidence that the miners are not alive. So to make the judgment there is no hope is premature.”The families want a 36-inch hole drilled to the area where the miners most likely retreated. That would be an opening large enough to lift up a man.The mine owners have resisted such a plan, having not found signs of life.Even if the miners are dead, the families say, they want the bodies recovered.In this coal mining region, residents have tied yellow ribbons around trees and stop signs, flown flags at half-staff and written prayers in sidewalk chalk, window paint and on posters in public places.At the Senior Citizens Center in Price, giant letters in the windows read, “Give us a miracle,” and, “Pray for our 6. We do.”“I sure loved those guys,” said Jill Hanna, who worked in a crew with Mr. Black and Mr. Allred. “I smashed Kerry’s finger when I first started and didn’t know what I was doing. He just looked at me and shook his head.”“Manny was so bubbly and polite to the point that it would make me giggle,” she recalled.Mr. Murray has said a 3.9 magnitude earthquake caused the collapse.Lee Siegel, a spokesman for the University of Utah, whose seismographs track tremors, said that was not accurate.“The quake was the collapse,” Mr. Siegel said.All the tremors afterward, including the “bump” on Thursday that killed the three men in the rescue effort, were the aftershocks of the mountain settling further, he added.An internal memo drafted in April by an engineering company noted poor roof conditions in March and a “large bump” that heavily damaged a tunnel section, prompting work to stop. The workers trapped on Aug. 6 were working about 900 feet away from that scene.“It’s clearly foreseeable when where they were mining was less than a thousand feet away from where they had a serious problem back in March,” said Tony Oppegard, a former top official in the mine safety administration and a former prosecutor of mine-safety violations in Kentucky.On Tuesday, Utah officials questioned the safety of the mine and its oversight by federal officials.“How is it that M.S.H.A. can come in and give this mine a clean bill of health and within weeks we have this catastrophe?” Gov. Jon M. Huntsman Jr. asked.Mr. Huntsman plans to spearhead an investigation into the disaster.'"
"'07-08-22,'1','“There will be damage to the ecosystem, of course, but conditions make it impossible for us to have any data yet,” said José Solís, of the National Commission of Natural Protected Areas. Officials planned to fly over the peninsula on Wednesday for an initial assessment.Early reports showed that the Mayan ruins along the eastern coast were not damaged, said Guillermina Escoto, a spokeswoman for the National Institute of Archaeology and History.On the road from Felipe Carrillo Puerto, a small town 100 miles north of Chetumal, uprooted trees blocked traffic until federal police officers cleared the way with chain saws. In towns along the way, people were salvaging whatever they could from ravaged homes and stores. In Los Limones, a sports center had been crumpled like a piece of paper.In Pedro Santos, about 45 miles north of Chetumal, Jacobo Reyes, 32, a grocer, stared at the concrete block walls of his store, which was missing its tin roof. “We thought it would stand up pretty well, but it wasn’t the case,” he said.His mother, Carmen Bustillos, 54, said she could not stand living in a hurricane alley. “I think now we should rebuild in a new place, start all over again,” she said.Chetumal took the brunt of the storm. Streets were inundated and debris was everywhere. Hundreds of trees lay strewn along major thoroughfares, and thousands of people were without power and running water. But with no deaths reported, city officials said that they were relieved.It appeared that the storm, although brutal, would not cause the devastation of Hurricane Wilma, which washed away whole beaches in Cancún in 2005, killed seven people and caused more than $2 billion in damage.“If it had come through Cancún, we would be talking about a different level of damage,” Dennis Feltgen, a meteorologist at the National Hurricane Center, said by telephone.Chetumal, the capital of Quintana Roo State and a major center for trade with neighboring Belize, has a long history of hurricane damage. Two hurricanes in the 1940s wiped it out. In 1955, a storm devastated it. Each time, the city rebuilt, using more concrete to buttress itself against the wind.The Mexican president, Felipe Calderón, left a meeting in Quebec with the leaders of Canada and the United States and arrived here Tuesday evening to see the extent of the damage. President Bush expressed support for him and said, “U.S. agencies are in close touch with the proper Mexican authorities, and if you so desire help, we stand ready to help.”The damage extended across the border to Belize, where residents scattered to the safety of shelters as the storm moved in.“We live near a swamp, and the crocodiles come out,” Chyla Gill told Reuters. She and her family had fled her wooden house in Belize City for a more fortified school building.The eye of the hurricane made landfall around 4:30 a.m. near the tourist resort of Majahual, about 40 miles northeast of Chetumal, the National Hurricane Center said.On Tuesday morning in Felipe Carrillo Puerto, the wind howled and power failed after the overnight deluge.As the sky became lighter, winds bent trees, tore corrugated iron roofs and knocked down signs. The streets were filled with water and littered with palm fronds and other debris. Overhead, clouds slid rapidly west.The town’s police chief, Abraham Oliva, said that the eye of the hurricane had passed through Laguna Guerrero, about 19 miles north of Chetumal.In the center of the old town, people peered timidly from their windows to assess the damage. Álvaro Sosa Marvil, a veterinarian who lives in the town square, said he was relieved to find at dawn that the destruction was not as bad as had been predicted.“This is a price one pays for living in a privileged place — the Caribbean,” he said, as he looked at the downed trees in the town square. “Nature collects a toll from us.”'"
"'07-08-22,'1','Even with a case of the sniffles, Levi Rudolph did not mind pitching through on-and-off rain, a stiff breeze and cool temperatures that made it seem more like early March than mid-August in South Williamsport, Pa.Rudolph pitched four-plus effective innings and drove home a run on a bunt single as Lake Oswego, Ore., defeated Hamilton, Ohio, 6-1, yesterday to advance to the Little League World Series semifinals.“The last couple days, I had a little cold, but I’ve played in these conditions all year,” said the 13-year-old Rudolph.In other games, Tokyo defeated White Rock, British Columbia, 7-1; and Maracaibo, Venezuela, routed Apeldoorn, Netherlands, 21-2.The tournament resumed yesterday after Monday’s five games were postponed because of rain.A drizzle fell much of yesterday, but heavier rain later forced the second-inning suspension of the game between Walpole, Mass., and Warner Robins, Ga. That game will be resumed today at 11 a.m. The game between Taiwan and Mexico was also postponed, to today at noon.Austin Andrews led off the bottom of the first with an opposite-field homer to right, part of a two-run inning for Lake Oswego (2-1), which never trailed. Hamilton (1-2) was eliminated.JAPAN 7, CANADA 1 Ryo Ogawa allowed two hits and struck out nine in five-plus innings and knocked in two runs to lead unbeaten Japan (2-0). Ogawa carried a no-hitter into the fourth before Evan Douglas singled with one out for Canada (1-1).'"
"'07-08-22,'1','SAN FRANCISCO, Aug. 21 — Consumers looking for a deal on an iPhone may be able to knock $100 off the price of the smartphone by buying from an unexpected discount source: Apple Inc.On Monday, the company began making refurbished iPhones available at its online store for $399 for the 4-gigabyte model, which sells for $499 at full retail, and $499 for the 8-gigabyte model, which retails for $599. Such an offer is a standard Apple practice; the site already offers discounts on most Apple products, which come with a one-year warranty.On Tuesday evening, the company declined to comment on the decision to make used phones available at a discount. Analysts have been speculating widely, however, on what Apple might say about the rate of sales and the number of phones sold.One possibility is that phones bought by speculators who thought they would be able to command a high resale price on eBay were quickly returned when supplies of the phones turned out to be plentiful.At the beginning of the year, the company’s chief executive, Steven P. Jobs, said that Apple planned to sell as many as 10 million phones worldwide by the end of 2008.Late last month, the day before Apple’s earnings report, AT&T, the iPhone’s wireless carrier, said it had activated only 146,000 iPhones during the product’s first day and a half on the market, the last two days of the quarter. That was far short of Wall Street estimates of 500,000 and sent shares down more than 6 percent in after-hours trading.'"
"'07-08-22,'1','Wall Street ended another erratic session with mixed results yesterday as investors, waiting for the Federal Reserve’s next move to steady the markets, made few big commitments to stocks.Comments from policy makers and government officials tugged at a market looking for any evidence the Fed would cut rates to help contain the credit crisis that began with failures in subprime loans.The Fed has taken a number of steps to prop up financial institutions ahead of its scheduled Sept. 18 meeting, including injecting more liquidity into the banking industry and cutting the discount rate. But many on Wall Street want the Fed to do more, including lowering the more important federal funds rate, and to do it before next month’s meeting.Traders reacted positively to comments from the Senate Banking Committee chairman, Christopher J. Dodd, who said the Fed chairman, Ben S.

"'07-08-22,'1','""If my father had started a bank for me, sooner or later we would have come to blows,"" he said.The potential potholes don’t bother Tom Faley, an 57-year-old executive with Sargento Foods in Plymouth, Wis., who has started three real estate companies as financial havens for his children and his six siblings.In 1991, he created Homes & More to buy dilapidated houses, fix them up and rent them out, with the intention of eventually turning the business over to his daughter, Linda, now 35.In 2001, he started Living Homes as a property management company and anointed his six siblings as his board of directors, both to give them experience in real estate and to enable them “to make cookie-cutter companies for their own kids,” he said.That same year, he started Building Appeal for his son Michael, now 31, to run some day. Conceived on the model of Homes & More, it has evolved into a manufacturer of interior trim for houses.All three ventures are thriving, he says. His son, a chemist who shares his father’s passion for woodworking, is putting in a lot of sweat equity. But neither his daughter, an entrepreneur who sells used toys on eBay, nor his siblings have yet taken active roles in their companies.So why is Mr. Faley getting up at 3 a.m. every day to work for several hours on his fledgling housing empire before heading to the office? “I’ve been laid off without cause in the corporate world, and I don’t want my kids to go through the panic I did,” he said. “I want to give them a safety net.”That same protective instinct is apparently motivating Dr. Escher. In the early 1970s, he abandoned a booming optometry practice in upstate New York and moved to Cape Cod for personal reasons. For a while, he treated patients in his home, trying his hand at writing plays and scripts for television shows in his spare time.After his marriage fell apart, he acted in a local cable station comedy show and took up darts in Cape Cod singles spots, letting his practice slide. His courtship of his second wife, Tina, rejuvenated him, and today his eye care business is flourishing.What he learned from his ups and downs, he said, was the importance of choosing a livelihood that will never go out of style, so that if you drift away from it, you can always come back.“I had a long talk with Elizabeth and Katy two or three years ago,” he said. “I told them there is an array of occupations that can be transplanted almost everywhere. We talked about various concepts. So this is sort of an experiment.”He listed the advantages of the spa business to his daughters. You can make good money without killing yourself, he said. You can set flexible working hours. “Not only that, I told them, their environment would be fun, peaceful, stress-free,” he said. “Just look around.”I did. The reception room of Spa 28 had dried blue flowers in vases, large mirrors, soft lighting, prints on the wall. The massage room had a working fireplace, thick blue and red curtains, shaded skylights, recessed lighting, floodlights, plush blue carpeting. I felt myself getting drowsy.Do his daughters buy into his vision? “Yeah, maybe. I think it’s a good idea,” said Katy, who has a degree from the Catherine Hinds Institute of Esthetics in Woburn, Mass., to do facials, waxing and body treatments, and who is also pursuing a business and marketing degree at Suffolk University in Boston. “I could do aesthetics but I think I would rather do the business part, managing the spa, buying products and like that.”Her sister Elizabeth, who is studying horticulture at the University of Massachusetts and who helped design Spa 28’s décor, chose the colors of the walls and created the floral arrangements and the flower garden out front, could have multiple roles. “She could be a receptionist, tend the gardens, do the decorations, organize events,” her father said. “She could hang her paintings on the wall and sell them.”Katy says she and Elizabeth talk about the venture a lot and try to imagine how it would evolve. If Spa 28 is successful, they would want to move to a bigger location and “do more of a life-center thing,” she said.If the spa is successful, Katy says, her sister Monica could work there, too. And the patriarch? Aside from financing the venture, he already does intense pulsed light treatments at the spa to remove hair and rejuvenate skin. Would the sisters tolerate his continued involvement?Correction: I reported in a column on Aug. 8 that the language-services industry does not have a trade group.

"'07-08-22,'1','“Accounting” is Mr. Ouamba’s debut in America, and Mr. Wilson is not as well known one might expect given his skill and experience; the multiple resonances in his work, from slave spirituals to postmodern task-based choreography, create dizzying, nonlinear performances that are as smart as they are sensual.The two met while Mr. Wilson was in Senegal in 2002 as a Guggenheim fellow; Mr. Ouamba had resettled in Dakar, the capital of Senegal, in the late 1990s after escaping war in Congo. They hit it off, personally and artistically, and Mr. Ouamba soon asked about collaborating in the United States.“And I said, ‘Ahh!’ ” Mr. Wilson laughed, giving a little shriek. “I told him, in my experience, it takes a while because of scheduling, funding and a lot of different things to worry about.”Prophetic words: Mr. Ouamba was to arrive last week, but a knee injury delayed his trip, followed by the inevitable drama of embassy red tape, overbooked flights and frantic trans-Atlantic calls. He finally arrived yesterday morning.Mr. Wilson can trace his own roots as far as the Mississippi Delta in the early 1800s. Like Katherine Dunham and Pearl Primus before him, he is an anthropologically minded choreographer, and his interest in working with Mr. Ouamba involves a deeper preoccupation with culture and how it is spread.“What,” he mused about the “Good Dance” project, “are the similarities and dissimilarities — metaphoric, real, imagined — between the peoples, the histories and the cultures of the Mississippi River and the Congo River?”Such in-depth collaborations are rare. American choreographers face more challenges than those in Europe, where government financial support facilitates an exchange between African and European artists, Mr. Wilson said. “A lot less of that is going on between contemporary choreographers in Africa and in the United States, and especially African-American choreographers.”Beyond money, “those bridges are not so easy across continents, even if people feel a cultural tradition or share a skin color,” said Philip Bither, senior curator for performing arts at the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis, which plans to present “The Good Dance.” “It’s not, sometimes, very easy for African-American choreographers to find equitable, enriching ways to collaborate with African artists.”Mr. Wilson draws as much inspiration from 20th-century dance lineages as he does from historical and traditional sources rooted in the African diaspora. He is intrigued by the tension between tradition and innovation: artists who receive credit for advancing an art form versus those seen (or dismissed) as working in traditional cultures, even when these cultures use the same innovations as experimental artists.“I’ll go back and look at a tape of Pina Bausch in the same way that I’ll go to Congo or I’ll go and get a history book,” Mr. Wilson said. “Like trying to find out about the Custom House: how, why is this here now?” he said, referring to the building. “It’s the story.”Like Ms. Aleong, Mr. Wilson wearies of the labels placed on him. European presenters expect him to teach tap and hip-hop in his workshops; faculty members at all-white dance programs in American universities are, he said, “amazed that I’m still able to reference the African diaspora without black bodies, or that I still have some sort of chops with time and with movement and with space.”“I get really frustrated talking about race with white people that haven’t thought about race,” he added. “Somehow it’s something I have to figure out; as a black choreographer I have to talk about why this work is a black piece or why this issue is important. Nobody asks John Jasperse about being white. And it’s truly a white aesthetic and a white history that he’s coming from in doing his work. But that’s not something he’s put to task about.”Ms. Aleong, who long ago ceased correcting people about her background, sympathized with his frustration. Then she chuckled. “I guess in a way I’m here to egg him on: ‘Go ahead, go ahead, do this. There are people out there who really need this.’ ”'"
"'07-08-22,'1','THE moment a ramen shop opens in New York — as, say, when Ramen Setagaya appeared in the East Village this summer — the anxious online ranks of the restaurant-obsessed are immediately atwitter with high hopes that (and heated arguments over whether) this will be the one: authentic, singular, a temple to ramenical devotion.I generally regard this as the Tampopo effect, after the movie wherein a mysterious and tough trucker guy helps a woman decipher the ramen masters’ secrets so she can open the best ramen shop possible. It’s a hard movie not to like and a hard mythology not to buy into. Don’t we all want our ramen cooks to be as devoted, as driven, as noodle-crazed as Tampopo?But it’s noodle soup, people. Keep it together. Setagaya is not the single-minded ramen restaurant of the wildest pork broth fantasies; it’s the first United States outpost of a popular Japanese chain. It splits a space on First Avenue with an unrelated restaurant, Oriental Spoon (which serves “pan-Asian tapas”).Setagaya itself is stripped down. A large flat-screen television plays Japanese programs, and the stools line up around cramped counters. But how much more finery does one need to enjoy a bowl of ramen?This noodle shop specializes in shio ramen, one of four primary styles of ramen broth, along with miso ramen, soy sauce (or shoyu) ramen, and tonkotsu, or extra-porky pork broth ramen.'"

Sales and development of mini-DVD camcorders, hard drive camcorders and memory-card camcorders are on the rise.I’d be delighted by the random-access pleasures of these new media types if it weren’t for one deal killer: the quality isn’t as good as tape. The manufacturers admit it. They have to massively compress the video to hold a reasonable amount of it on a memory card, mini-DVD or hard drive, and MiniDV tapes still offer better quality.Why doesn’t somebody lick this problem, or at least offer us a capacity/quality tradeoff? Don’t they think we care about quality?The all-in-one camcorder/camera. I’ve been writing about this mythical beast for 7 years, too.

"'07-08-23,'0','WASHINGTON, Aug. 23 — The Bush administration has confirmed for the first time that American telecommunications companies played a key role in the National Security Agency’s domestic eavesdropping program after asserting for nearly two years that any role played by the companies was a “state secret.”The acknowledgment came in an unusual interview that Mike McConnell, the director of national intelligence, conducted with The El Paso Times in Texas last week in which he discussed a number of sensitive issues that the administration has long insisted were classified and has refused to discuss publicly. He made the remarks in an apparent effort to explain the broadened wiretapping authority that the administration gained from Congress earlier this month in legislation that Democrats are already threatening to rework.Mr. McConnell’s office refused to say whether the topics he disclosed, including the role of the telecommunication companies and the number of Americans intercepted through court-approved warrants, had been declassified prior to the interview. Mr. McConnell asserted in the interview, a transcript of which the newspaper released Wednesday, that the public debate surrounding the Congressional legislation this month would harm national security by giving terrorists information they could use against the United States.“Part of this is a classified world. The fact that we’re doing it this way means that some Americans are going to die,” he said in the Aug. 14 interview.In acknowledging the role of the telecommunications companies in the N.S.A. program, Mr. McConnell said that “under the president’s program, the terrorist surveillance program, the private sector had assisted us.

"'07-08-23,'0','The College Board, the powerful testing organization known for its SAT and Advanced Placement exams, announced yesterday that it was getting out of the student loan business.The College Board, a nonprofit organization based in New York City that has been expanding into new products like English and math curriculums, began offering student loans in the early 1990s, partnering with companies that included Sallie Mae and Citibank. The lenders extended the money, while the College Board received a fee from them for serving essentially as a gateway for borrowers.In explaining its decision to abandon the business, the College Board cited new legislation and regulations cracking down on relationships between lenders and colleges that have been enacted in the wake of revelations that numerous lenders were paying colleges commissions or bonuses in exchange for business. College officials have also received free trips, meals and other perks to win spots on the so-called preferred lender lists that students rely on when selecting a loan company.Edna Johnson, a College Board spokeswoman, said the new rules — designed to prevent conflicts of interest that could lead universities to steer students to particular lenders — would prevent the organization from conducting events it routinely holds with university officials to discuss topics like student writing skills, admissions trends and financial aid.“We understand and respect the intent of this new legislation and these new codes, but the end result is that we’re not able to reimburse our members for travel and lodging,” Ms. Johnson said. “If we no longer reimburse the educators, then only those educators from schools, colleges and universities with the financial resources to pay for the travel and the accommodations would attend.”'"
"'07-08-23,'0','Of the roughly 40,000 Austrians who are of draft age each year, 30,000 do the military service, 10,000 perform civic services and 25 are accepted into a Holocaust remembrance program, about 5 of them a year in the United States, said Wolfgang Renezeder, a spokesman for the Austrian Embassy in Washington.“They are highly motivated young people,” said Mr. Renezeder, who said the interns serving in other countries were not encountering visa problems.The participating museums and cultural organizations are often working on small budgets and greatly appreciate the interns, who help translate documents from the archives, give tours and meet with Austrian and other Holocaust survivors.But applicants in the United States are now having a hard time getting the type of visa that American officials advised the program were necessary, namely one that allows cultural exchange and work for a limited period.The application for the Los Angeles intern, Valentin Hofer, was submitted in mid-May, Mr. Rothman said. The museum heard nothing until late June, when immigration officials requested more information, which was submitted, he said. The rejection was received this month.“If Los Angeles Museum of the Holocaust loses its administrative appeal,” Mr. Rothman said, “we most certainly will sue the Department of Homeland Security to correct this miscarriage of justice.”At the Leo Baeck Institute in New York, which accepts two interns a year, two applications have been lingering for five months, with no word as to their status, said Emil Rennert, an intern who runs the center’s Austrian heritage collection.The Virginia Holocaust Museum has more or less given up on the program, said Timothy Hensley, the librarian there, because the visa process has gotten too difficult.“This is going on pretty much everywhere,” Mr. Hensley said. “We have tried three times since 2003, and every year it gets more complicated and weird. Since 9/11, the information you provide for the program has suddenly become inauthentic. We get lots of questions about whether our program is valid.”The process took so many months, Mr. Hensley said, that potential interns took positions in other countries.“You have this whole problem with immigration thinking, ‘Why is this person coming to the country and not being paid?’ ” he said. “But they are getting a work visa and that is just the way the program is set up. It has been disappointing.”At the Museum of Tolerance, also in Los Angeles, a recent intern’s visa process took six months, making it impossible for him to complete the yearlong program. The museum’s director, Liebe Geft, said it would continue seeking the Austrian interns.“As long as our organization is able to host this program, I intend to start this process earlier,” Ms. Geft said.Marie Sebrechts, the West Coast spokeswoman for Citizenship and Immigration Services, an agency within the Department of Homeland Security, said there was no inherent reason that the Austrian applications had been denied or delayed. She said the agency typically had a two-month processing time.Such delays, she said, generally have to do “with security clearance.” Ms. Sebrechts added: “It is true that there are more security checks since 9/11,” but it terms of the Holocaust program, “Nobody had noticed any trends.”Mr. Hofer, the prospective Los Angeles intern, reached by phone in Austria, said he was confused, but remained hopeful.“I am not a terrorist and I don’t have any Nazi relatives,” he said. “I expected a positive decision. I didn’t even think about what would happen if there was a denial.”'"

Daphna Nachminovitch, a spokeswoman for People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, said the dogs would probably be euthanized because they are not adoptable as pets.Vick, 27, said through a lawyer this week that he would plead guilty to a federal charge of conspiracy to travel in interstate commerce in aid of unlawful activities and conspiracy to sponsor a dog in an animal-fighting venture. He is scheduled to enter his plea agreement Monday and faces up to five years in prison.SUPPORT FOR VICK An N.A.A.C.P. leader said Michael Vick should be allowed to return to the N.F.L., preferably the Atlanta Falcons, after serving his sentence.“As a society, we should aid in his rehabilitation and welcome a new Michael Vick back into the community without a permanent loss of his career in football,” said R. L. White, the president of the N.A.A.C.P.’s Atlanta chapter. “We further ask the N.F.L., Falcons, and the sponsors not to permanently ban Mr. Vick from his ability to bring hours of enjoyment to fans all over this country.”'"
"'07-08-23,'0','Wall Street registered its approval yesterday of a potential takeover of the commodities exchange operator Nymex, sending the parent company’s stock higher.The share price jumped after the chairman of Nymex Holdings, Richard Schaeffer, said late Tuesday that the company had had preliminary discussions with a possible buyer. He said any deal must offer a meaningful premium to the current stock price.Nymex is the operator of the New York Mercantile Exchange, the world’s largest energy market. Its shares rose $7.28, or more than 6 percent, to $126.06.There has been intense speculation about the future of Nymex for the last year as global financial markets consolidate. Commodities and futures exchanges are considered the most likely targets for acquisition as bigger stock markets look to expand their businesses.Executives of the Nasdaq Stock Market and NYSE Euronext, which operates the New York Stock Exchange, have stated an interest in acquiring an exchange to increase their trading of commodities and stock options. In April, Deutsche Börse announced a deal to buy the International Securities Exchange.Nymex did not identify its partner in the discussions, but there have been reports that Mr. Schaeffer is holding talks with the New York Stock Exchange. Spokesmen from both exchanges declined to comment.'"
"'07-08-23,'0','Meanwhile, demand for the Solstice’s fraternal twin, the costlier and more angular Saturn Sky, has shown no signs of subsiding. G.M. has about one month’s worth of the Sky available, and many buyers still have to wait several weeks or months for their Sky to arrive.Each of Pontiac’s 2,700 dealers sells, on average, just over one Solstice every two months, while each of Saturn’s 440 dealers sells about two of the Sky, which is produced in more limited numbers, every month. Pontiac plans to build 20,000 Solstices this year and is on pace to sell 18,000.It is evidence not only of how quickly the luster on stylish cars can fade but also how difficult it is for an automotive brand to win back customers once they have been put off.“They’re very much fashion statements,” Mr. Brown said of cars like the Solstice. “The newest one that arrives is the hottest one, and that bloom can last from 6 to 18 months, depending on what else comes out.”Both the Sky and the Solstice are low-production, niche vehicles that are worth more to G.M. in the traffic they bring to showrooms than for the actual profits they generate. (Sticker prices start at $22,115 for the Solstice and $25,325 for the Sky.)The Sky is among the hot vehicles that have helped revitalize the Saturn brand this year. Saturn sales are up 15 percent, the most among G.M.’s brands, and G.M. is spending considerably more money promoting Saturn than Pontiac. Sales at G.M.C., which shares dealerships with Pontiac and Buick, have climbed 2 percent, while sales are down at the other six brands.A spokesman for Pontiac, Jim Hopson, said the company was “not terribly concerned” by the size of its Solstice inventory or by the vehicle’s lower sales numbers this year. Inventories began to build last summer, when Pontiac introduced the turbo-charged Solstice GXP, reducing demand for the base model and giving dealers a reason to have an additional Solstice on their lots, he said.Mr. Hopson said some dealers still have only one Solstice, making them reluctant to sell it and risk losing whatever customers that “showroom trophy” may draw inside.But other dealers have 10 or more in stock, and some have been trying to push them out the door by cutting as much as $1,000 off the sticker price. Edmunds.com, a Web site that gives car-buying advice to consumers, reports that Solstice buyers are getting an average discount of $475, while the Sky is selling at sticker price. (Saturn dealers have a no-haggle pricing policy.)Hal Waldrop, a Solstice owner, said he recently saw six of the roadsters lined up at the Pontiac dealership near his home in Frisco, Tex., just north of Dallas.“I had never seen more than two there previously,” he said.Mr. Waldrop, 49, was told he was 45th on the dealer’s waiting list for a Solstice and would have to wait up to a year to receive one when he ordered one in November 2005. The dealer called two months later to offer a green one — a color known as “envious” in the Solstice’s list of emotionally named color options drawn from “The Apprentice” — when its intended buyer’s financing fell through.“The car is just a joy,” Mr. Waldrop said. “When the top’s down and you’re on a twisty road, I can’t imagine anything would be more fun. Even today, I cannot stop at a gas station without someone walking up and telling me how much they like it. Almost everybody guesses it would be a $40,000 car if they don’t know what it is.”But the Solstice’s critically praised design and low sticker price relative to many competing models might not be enough when it is sold under a brand name that G.M. neglected for years. Robert A. Lutz, the G.M. vice chairman who conceived the Solstice, called Pontiac and Buick “damaged brands” during a 2005 speech at the New York auto show.Pontiac has several other new models on the horizon, including the full-size G8 sedan, that the company hopes will shore up the intended identity of the 81-year-old brand as a producer of performance-oriented cars.“Saturn, although it had been struggling, has nowhere near the type of negative baggage that the Pontiac brand does,” Mr. Brown, the auto consultant, said. “That brand is damaged. If you ask the average person, I don’t think they could tell you what the brand’s supposed to be.”DETROIT, Aug. 22 (AP) — General Motors said Wednesday that it had cut production at six plants that make large sport utility vehicles and pickups, citing fuel prices and competition in the market.A G.M. spokesman, Tom Wickham, said that the company had eliminated previously scheduled overtime production at plants in Arlington, Tex.; Janesville, Wis.; Fort Wayne, Ind.; Flint, Mich.; Silao, Mexico; and Oshawa, Ontario.The change will be in effect for the rest of the year.'"
"'07-08-23,'0','WASHINGTON, Aug. 22 — Officials at Virginia Tech University issued a set of mild recommendations for campus security Wednesday, suggesting the university provide more counseling for mentally troubled students, erect Internet-based message boards across campus to alert students of emergencies and install more surveillance cameras and better internal door locks.But the nearly 200-page internal review avoids criticizing the campus police or university officials for their actions during the campus shootings on April 16 that left 33 people dead. University officials said the review was not intended to be an investigation of their responses to the shooting, adding that such an investigation is best conducted by an outside panel like the one convened by Gov. Tim Kaine, which will release its findings next week.Many families of victims have said the university should have shut down the campus after the first bodies were found but before the gunman, Seung-Hui Cho, started his second shooting spree. But on Wednesday, Charles W. Steger, the university president, defended his decision not to do so.“A lockdown is simply not feasible on a campus that is the size of a small city,” Dr. Steger said. “Our review reflects the consensus of law enforcement.”The report said there was adequate coordination between Virginia Tech and local emergency workers, but recommended that officials improve the university’s ability to handle emergencies by centralizing the campus police and fire departments into one building. The cellular and phone systems on campus should also be upgraded to avoid being overloaded in emergencies, the report said.The report described the university’s mental health system as responsive, but said privacy laws had created confusion about gaining access to students’ health information. It called for an increase in the number of case workers on campus who can identify students at risk of mental problems.Some of the changes suggested by the report have already been made. The university has replaced many of the types of door handles that enabled Mr. Cho to chain the doors during his attack, preventing the police from entering when they first arrived. It has also instituted a system to alert students and staff members of emergencies by text messages to cellphones, e-mail accounts and online instant messages.'"
"'07-08-23,'0','The inaugural European University Bridge Cup, which took place in Bruges, Belgium, Aug. 4 to 9, was won by Paris-Sud.The title of the event was misleading because high school teams also competed. There was a large entry of 32 teams from 12 countries. They played a round robin of 8-board matches from which four teams qualified for the 20-board semifinals, followed by a 20-board final. The four qualifiers were Sor-Trondelag High School from Norway, Halmstad High School from Sweden, Paris-Sud University and Warsaw University.In the semifinals experience triumphed over youth, Paris-Sud defeating Halmstad 70 international match points to 21 and Warsaw beating Sor-Trondelag 41 imps to 31.At halftime in the final Paris-Sud led Warsaw 11 imps to 5. And with three boards to play, Paris-Sud had expanded its lead to 8 imps. On Board 18 a light 10-point Polish opening bid pushed the opposing French pair into a four-heart contract that could not be defeated. At the other table a cautious Polish pass ended the auction in two hearts, giving Paris-Sud 10 imps. The diagramed deal was Board 19.In the other room, after Jacek Kalita (South) from Poland opened one diamond, Olivier Bessis (West) also chose to overcall only one heart. Some would leap to four hearts to try to silence the opposition. With this layout who knows what would then have happened. Krzysztof Buras (North) bid one spade, which was a transfer, meaning that he had a normal one-no-trump response. This was a sensible action, the basic guideline being that if you would have responded after a pass on your right, you try to do something when your right-hand opponent intervenes.'"

"'07-08-24,'1','Mr. McCain said this spring that reporters seemed to show more interest in his age than the voters did, and used his trademark humor to try to defuse the issue.“Usually people watch my performance to see if I need a drool cup, or stumble around, or anything like that,” he said during a stop in Palm Beach, Fla. “Usually people just come and watch me, and I try to show them the energy and vigor that I’m capable of.”To that end, Mr. McCain keeps up a grueling travel schedule, criss-crossing the country for fund-raisers and campaign stops, and packing lots of events into campaign days. He is not one to take a lot of downtime on the trail — he is more likely to spend plane rides chatting with campaign aides or reporters than napping, and he fills in the gaps in his schedule with interviews and conference calls and other work. He has been known to pepper his conversation with youthful expressions — “um, duh!” is a favorite expression of sarcasm — and he has appeared on “The Daily Show with Jon Stewart,” which is popular with younger audiences, 10 times, more than any other candidate.Mr. McCain has a scarred, puffy left cheek from surgery that he had in 2000 after doctors discovered his third melanoma, which is plainly visible on television. His pale white skin sometimes looks even whiter than it really is, thanks to the powerful sunblock he wears. And his war wounds — he broke both arms and his right knee when his plane was shot down over North Vietnam, and suffered more injuries at the hands of his captors during five and a half years as a prisoner of war — have left him with stiffness in his knee, and arms that he cannot raise without difficulty.But he still has a trim, fit bearing on the campaign trail. He stays constantly in motion at the town-hall-style campaign events he favors, pacing back and forth with a microphone in hand while he parrying questions.Sometimes he can come across on television as subdued, or old-looking, analysts said. Frank Luntz, a Republican strategist who once worked for Rudolph W. Giuliani, has conducted focus groups after several of the debates this year for Fox News. He said that some people in his groups used words like “tired” and “old” to describe Mr. McCain.Age and health have surfaced as an issue in past presidential elections, and political consultants and analysts warned that the McCain campaign must handle it sensitively. The risk, they said, was that any gaffe can get chalked up to age.“Any misstep, you don’t get the benefits of the doubt: people start looking at you and start thinking of you as a 70-year-old,” said Ed Rollins, the Republican strategist who managed the 1984 re-election campaign of Mr. Reagan.Mr. Rollins said that age “was the major issue we worried about in ’84.” It grew in importance after Mr. Reagan gave some faltering answers in his first debate with Walter Mondale, the Democratic presidential candidate.Scott Reed, who managed the 1996 presidential campaign of Mr. Dole, said that he thought health was a more important issue than age these days.“You have to take health head on, and be aggressive about promoting your health records, showing a campaign style that has vigor, and most importantly not over-scheduling the candidate,” said Mr. Reed, a McCain supporter. “I think McCain has done a very good job in his addressing the issue by playing the experience card.”When the subject of age arose for Mr. McCain on the campaign trail in Ankeny, he delivered a pair of anecdotes he often tells when he is asked about it. First he spoke about how his 95-year-old mother, Roberta, drove herself around France last year, buying herself a car after a rental company turned her down for one. (“I have great genes,” he explained to the crowd.) And then he talked about hiking the Grand Canyon “from rim to rim” with his son Jack last August — joking that, “in full disclosure,” the trek nearly killed him.In 1999, during Mr. McCain’s first race for president, he released 1,500 pages of medical and psychiatric records — the standard evaluations given to all former prisoners of war after their release — providing the broadest look ever given the public about the psychological profile of a presidential candidate.The records detailed what Mr. McCain told his doctors after his release, including how he tried to keep his mind occupied during long periods of solitary confinement by recalling details of old movies, books and philosophy. They described the extensive injuries to his shoulders, his right knee and his hip. And the records mentioned that in 1968, after he received some particularly brutal beatings from his North Vietnamese captors, Mr. McCain attempted suicide, trying to hang himself by his shirt — something that Mr. McCain seemed to allude to this spring in a speech on immigration.“I know why people want to come here,” he said in the speech, in which he described the risks that some immigrants take to come to America. “I once thought I would rather die than be denied my country for one more day.”The records that he released included a battery of the standard psychological evaluations that were given to prisoners of Vietnam after their release. Dr. Michael M. Ambrose, director of the Robert E. Mitchell Center for Prisoner of War Studies, and Dr. Jeffrey L. Moore, a clinical neuropsychologist at the center, wrote in a statement at the time that ""Senator McCain has never been diagnosed with or treated at the center for a psychological or psychiatric disorder.""Mr. McCain also takes care to avoid the sun because he had had skin cancer — three melanomas between 1993 and 2000. So on the campaign trail he sometimes wears baseball caps at outdoor events, or seeks out shade. Mr. McCain has released little medical information since his surgery for melanoma in 2000. His campaign has said that it will release more detailed updated medical information at some point.So, faced with rivals who are younger, but also have far less time in elected office, Mr. McCain tried to make a virtue of his age. “I’m not the youngest candidate,” he said in his campaign-kickoff speech. “But I am the most experienced.”'"
"'07-08-24,'1','Khalil Greene, who led off with a double, scored the tying run on a pinch-hit double by Terrmel Sledge, who came home on Josh Bard’s single up the middle.“I thought we had them,” Delgado said. “You want Billy Wagner out there with a one-run lead in the ninth.”The Padres, naturally, felt the same way when they sent out Hoffman to pitch for the third consecutive night. José Reyes singled with one out, moved to second on Luis Castillo’s single, and both runners moved up on a double steal. The extra runner in scoring position proved crucial when David Wright lofted a sacrifice fly to deep center to score Reyes with the tying run.Hoffman intentionally walked Carlos Beltrán, then unintentionally walked Delgado to load the bases for Moises Alou, who grounded out to end the inning.Still, the damage was done. According to the Elias Sports Bureau, Hoffman and Wagner had the most combined saves by closers who failed to convert save opportunities in the same game, breaking the mark of 620 set by Dennis Eckersley and John Franco on April 4, 1996.Wagner was in position to blow the save only because the Mets’ offense finally awakened against San Diego starter Justin Germano. The Mets loaded the bases in the sixth against him on a single, an error and a walk. In came the sidearming right-hander Cla Meredith to face Delgado, who was coming off an 0-for-5 night that included four failed opportunities with runners in scoring position.“He’s reverting back to letting people get him out,” said Manager Willie Randolph, adding that he may consider switching Delgado and Alou, the No. 6 hitter, in the lineup. “He swung at a ball last night that almost hit me in the dugout.”Delgado popped up the second pitch to shortstop and on his way back to the dugout flung his helmet toward the on-deck circle. That was the last good pitch Meredith threw. Alou walked, forcing in Castillo to cut the Padres’ lead to 6-2, and Shawn Green, given a start in right field, ripped Meredith’s first pitch for a two-run single. After Sandy Alomar, Jr., lined out to second, Anderson pounced on a down-and-in 0-1 pitch and drove it into the right-field stands for a three-run homer. Anderson pumped his fist. The crowd screamed. The dugout went wild. Only to have everyone’s emotions twisted and wrenched time after time over the final four innings.The Mets announced that Pedro Martínez would make his next rehabilitation start Monday for Class A St. Lucie in Jupiter, Fla. General Manager Omar Minaya acknowledged that the team had considered bringing Martínez north, to either Class A Brooklyn or Class AA Binghamton, but leaving him in Florida allows him to take advantage of the rehabilitation services at the Mets’ minor league complex. “It’s more about his pitches and if he is accomplishing what he wants to,” Minaya said. “At Port St. Lucie or at a higher level, it’s not going to matter.” The Mets gave Martínez, who is expected to throw 80 to 90 pitches, a full week between starts to line him up with Brian Lawrence, who is scheduled to pitch Monday in Philadelphia and will be replaced when Martínez is ready to rejoin the rotation. ... Paul Lo Duca’s first scheduled rehabilitation game for Class A Brooklyn was postponed because of fog. He is scheduled to play for the Cyclones today and for Class AA Binghamton in Trenton tomorrow. He is on track to rejoin the Mets for Monday’s game in Philadelphia. ... Luis Castillo said he tweaked his right knee while running to third base in the ninth inning last night.'"
"'07-08-24,'1','Home Depot was scrambling last night to save the sale of its wholesale unit to a consortium of private equity firms, lowering its asking price by about $1.2 billion from the original $10.3 billion it agreed upon, people involved in the talks said.Still, the deal announced in June remained uncertain as the banks that committed to finance the transaction — JPMorgan Chase, Lehman Brothers and Merrill Lynch — threatened to back out, setting up a showdown that could become a harbinger amid the current credit crisis.The sale of Home Depot’s wholesale unit, which provides pipes, lumber and concrete for professional builders, is the first deal-related victim of the housing slowdown and the credit squeeze. The confluence of both problems has created an enormous headache for Wall Street, which had agreed to back dozens of huge buyouts at very attractive rates and will now very likely suffer big losses as a result.In the case of Home Depot, the deal has created a battle that pits some of Wall Street’s biggest banks against some of its biggest clients — the consortium of private equity players that includes Bain Capital, the Carlyle Group and Clayton, Dubilier & Rice.Despite Home Depot’s willingness to reduce the asking price to just slightly more than $9 billion, the banks that committed to finance the transaction are worried that the dip in the housing market — and its impact on Home Depot’s wholesale unit — means they will be able to sell the debt to other investors only for a fraction of what they paid, losing hundreds of millions, if not billions, of dollars.'"

"'07-08-24,'1','After a sports summer rocked by a gambling scandal involving the former N.B.A. referee Tim Donaghy and a betting investigation involving a match played by the fourth-ranked men’s tennis player Nikolay Davydenko, the United States Tennis Association has hired a consulting firm to detect and monitor potential gambling activity at the United States Open.The firm of SafirRosetti, run by Howard Safir, a former city police commissioner, has begun work at the Billie Jean King United States National Tennis Center, the site of the Open.Besides monitoring areas throughout the grounds — included those restricted to players, their entourages and medical personnel — the firm will try to keep tabs on all betting activity surrounding the Open.“There is absolutely no reason that we know of where we suspect the nature of any betting as it relates to the U.S. Open,” Arlen Kantarian, chief executive of professional tennis for the U.S.T.A., said yesterday in a telephone interview. “But I think it is incumbent on all of us to take a keener look on how we approach these policies.”Kantarian added that SafirRosetti would not be conducting interviews or an investigation.Gambling is prohibited under rules governing the Grand Slam tournaments, and any player found in violation would be subject to a fine of up to $100,000 or the forfeiture of prize money won, whichever is greater. Players could also be suspended for up to three years from Grand Slam events.'"
"'07-08-24,'1','“One way or the other, I’m trying to think or I’m trying not to think and so I’m thinking about that,” Granderson said. “That’s the difficult part for me right now.”Actually, no matter what Granderson thinks, he is having a stellar season for the Tigers, who open an important four-game series with the Yankees tonight in Detroit. The Yankees won three of four games from Detroit last weekend at Yankee Stadium. Both teams are in the hunt for the American League wild card.As a blossoming center fielder and leadoff batter, Granderson is batting .285 with 56 runs batted in and 93 runs scored in his second full season. But the statistics that make him distinctive are not usually associated with someone who hits first in the order. With 66 extra-base hits, Granderson is tied for second in the A.L., with his teammate Magglio Ordóñez. Yankees third baseman Alex Rodriguez leads with 69.Granderson, the extra-base-hit machine, has 31 doubles, 19 triples and 16 home runs. If he hits one more triple, he will be the first Tiger with at least 20 in a season since Ty Cobb hit 24 in 1917.But Granderson does something else that leadoff hitters do not often do. He has struck out 119 times in 125 games.Still, Granderson’s extra-base total is impressive. Rodriguez, who leads the major leagues with 42 home runs and 121 R.B.I., is on pace to hit 54 homers and is a leading contender for the A.L. Most Valuable Player award. So is Ordóñez, who leads the majors with a .353 batting average.“The one thing for me is I’m not trying to become a power guy,” Granderson said. “It’s one of those things where, if I hit the ball to the gap, I’m going to try my best to use my legs and get to second, get to third, especially if the outfielder had to go to his left or his right.”That response, both smart and analytical, is typical. Granderson knows how challenging it is for an outfielder to dash into the gap to retrieve a ball, then turn around and make an accurate throw. Armed with that insight, he forces the action. That approach has helped him on many of his triples. In other words, Granderson is thinking, but not too much, and he is having fun hustling.“He trusts himself on the field,” said Dee, the college coach who helped spawn the message on the cap. “He doesn’t need to carry as big a burden about ‘I’ve got to do this’ or ‘I’ve got to do that.’ He can have fun on the field.”Detroit Manager Jim Leyland is keenly aware of how analytical Granderson can be. When the Tigers promoted Cameron Maybin, their center field prospect, from Class AA Erie last Friday, Leyland emphasized that Granderson would stay in center and Maybin would play left. At one point, Leyland pointed to his head to stress that he did not want Granderson thinking about possibly being shifted.After the Tigers drafted Granderson in the third round in 2002, he said, “The knock on me was that I couldn’t play center field.” To prove that he could, Granderson said, he has tried to make center “as small as possible” by studying the opposing hitters and Detroit’s pitchers. He said he used that insight to position himself “and make it seem like I cover a little more ground.”Granderson, who earned two business degrees from Illinois-Chicago, started the Grand Kids Foundation and reads to students in Detroit’s schools. He has a breezy blog on Espn.com, in which he answers questions from fans. And Granderson has four simple words on the brim of his cap, words that he tries to play by: “Don’t Think. Have Fun.”'"
"'07-08-24,'1','WASHINGTON, Aug. 23 — The head of the Justice Department’s civil rights division announced Thursday that he was resigning, the latest in a long string of departures from the department in the midst of a furor over the leadership of Attorney General Alberto R.

Although Congressional Democrats and civil rights groups have accused the division of abandoning its commitment to protection of minority rights under President Bush, Mr. Kim was not personally singled out for criticism.'"

"'07-08-24,'1','WASHINGTON, Aug. 23 (AP) — Two major airlines were fined $300 million each Thursday after admitting that they had conspired to fix prices on international flights and agreeing to help prosecutors investigate other airlines.The airlines — British Airways, Britain’s largest airline, and Korean Air, South Korea’s national carrier — pleaded guilty to antitrust conspiracy charges. They acknowledged colluding with rivals over cargo rates and fuel surcharges, which had been added to fares in response to rising oil prices. That meant higher costs for international shippers and passengers.Judge John D. Bates of Federal District Court in Washington said the case “involved considerable commerce and reflected long-term and widespread conduct involving major airlines and players.”Fines were reduced for both airlines because they had cooperated with Justice Department investigators. Korean Air’s fines could have been twice as high, and British Airways could have faced fines closer to $900 million.“Any anticompetitive behavior is to be condemned at British Airways or at other companies. It will not be tolerated and we remain vigilant in this respect,” British Airways’ chief executive, Willie Walsh, said in a statement released after the court proceedings.'"

"'07-08-24,'1','In her commercial, Street, a gold medalist in skiing at the 1998 Olympics, evokes Dove’s Real Beauty campaign, which celebrates the shapes of everyday women.“I started building this body when I was 13,” she says. “I did it on purpose. Mass times velocity equals momentum. When I look in the mirror, I see an athlete. Mass is an advantage. And I’m proud of that athlete.”A billboard showing two pictures of Serena Williams from the waist up will also be unveiled Tuesday at West 34th Street and Seventh Avenue in Manhattan. Between the images, a question is posed: “Are you looking at my titles?”The campaign is rolling out at the start of the W.N.B.A. playoffs and the United States Open, and in advance of the kickoff of the Women’s World Cup in China on Sept. 10.“It’s time to nudge the conversation,” Reece said in an interview. “Women’s professional sports have plateaued. I’ve seen it in beach volleyball; as a league, it’s been in the same place for a long time. At the grass roots, they’re taking physical education out of schools.”The ads were created by Wieden & Kennedy but are unscripted; the athletes were briefed on the broad themes but ad-libbed their parts.Diana Taurasi, a guard for the Phoenix Mercury, said by telephone: “They threw us topics about racism, sexism — all the things that are a backlash to women’s sports. We freelanced, and I guess it came out powerfully.”Sarah Reinertsen, a triathlete who has worn a prosthetic left leg since she was 7, said the campaign resonated with her.“I’ve always been fighting to be seen as an athlete but also as a disabled woman,” she said in an interview. “For so long, I wasn’t included in sports, so I feel every person, regardless of gender or disability, has a right to be an athlete.”Some of the themes raised in the ads emerged in Nike’s interviews with 175 teenage female athletes in major markets around the country this year.“They think of themselves as competitors first and want to win as much as their male counterparts,” Nancy Monsarrat, Nike’s United States brand marketing director, said. “But as strong as they are, they had issues about sexism and inequities in the sports they play compared with the males.”A campaign aimed at teenage girls is a strategy that helps Nike maintain its hold on female consumers, and comes shortly after Under Armour began a marketing push aimed at the team girls niche.Nike says it has 19 percent of the combined United States and European footwear and apparel markets for women; John Horan, the publisher of the newsletter Sporting Goods Intelligence, said that Nike was far ahead of any of its competitors.Last year, in a whimsical vein, Nike cast Maria Sharapova in a TV ad in which everyone she passed on her way to the United States Open sang “I Feel Pretty.”But in April, after Don Imus’s remarks about the Rutgers women’s basketball team, which Nike sponsors, were viewed as racist, the company ran a full-age ad in The New York Times with 10 lines that began, “Thank you, ignorance,” and continued, “Thank you for unintentionally moving women’s sport forward.”The new campaign broadly continues the debate sparked by Imus’s poorly chosen words.“The Imus incident was key,” Taurasi said. “A lot of people still think that way about women athletes.”Faith Hill will replace Pink as the singer of “Waiting All Day for Sunday Night,” which opens NBC’s “Sunday Night Football.” ...

"'07-08-24,'1','In testimony last March at a hearing on clean energy, Mr. Murray told a House subcommittee that federal lands should be preserved, but also “prudently developed” to provide jobs.In every reference to climate change, he used the term “so-called global warming.” The debate, he said, “has been skewed and totally one-sided,” because the news media, Congress and pundits have been “preoccupied with possible, speculative environmental disasters.”In 2001, a jury acquitted Mr. Murray of charges that he had assaulted an environmentalist.That same year, the National Labor Relations Board filed a complaint accusing Mr. Murray of violating federal labor laws at one of his companies, Maple Creek Mining, in Bentleyville, Pa., about 20 miles south of Pittsburgh. The United Mine Workers said Mr. Murray had threatened to replace union workers at the mine after they talked publicly about a labor dispute.In 2003, a federal court jury in Owensboro, Ky., convicted another of Mr. Murray’s companies, Ken American Resources, and four current or former employees on charges of conspiracy, lying and violating safety laws pertaining to dust levels at a mine in western Kentucky from 1996 to 2000. They faced fines of up to $1.4 million, but the company appealed and paid roughly $300,000.Mr. Murray has said that none of his miners have ever died in an accident, but federal mine records show otherwise. In April 2001, Thomas M. Ciszewski, a 45-year-old foreman, bled to death in the Powhatan No. 6 mine in Alledonia, Ohio, owned and operated by Mr. Murray’s Ohio Valley Coal Company.Federal investigators determined that Mr. Ciszewski, a 22-year mining veteran, was on a routine job when a conveyer belt cut off his arm, and was “bleeding profusely from the loss of the limb.” He died, in part, because there was not adequate first aid.The company was fined a total of $15,000.A self-made coal baron, Mr. Murray, owns 19 mines in five states, several with safety records far worse that that of Crandall Canyon, which has 33 health and safety violations this year. For instance, his Galatia mine, in Illinois, has accumulated more than 850 federal health and safety violations in 2007, in addition to about $1.46 million in fines.Murray Energy mines produce more than 30 million tons of coal annually, generating annual sales of at least $800 million and fostering accusations from some miners and their families that Mr. Murray cares more about growing his bottom line than he does about making his mines safer for his workers.“It’s hurting me very much,” he said this week during a middle-of-the night phone call to a reporter. “What they’re reporting is that I’m greedy. That is just so inflammatory and false and misleading to everyone in America.”Again and again, he calls himself a champion of miners and an advocate for their well-being and that of their families.But he is not always perceived that way. This week, relatives of the men trapped in the Crandall Canyon mine were outraged when Mr. Murray said that he planned to seal the mine, entombing their bodies inside, and to continue mining in another part of the vast property.He reversed himself the next day, saying he had simply been doing what he always does — telling the truth. In all likelihood, he said, the miners had died and it was not safe to continue trying to find them. “I’m no P.R. man,” Mr. Murray readily acknowledged.But as he rides over mountain roads on the way to candlelight vigils for the miners or funerals for the rescuers, he passes signs that come close to calling him a liar. Lori Prince, a local insurance agent, put up one such sign, which read, “Bob Murray, keep your promises.”“He did say he was going to get them all out” dead or alive, Ms. Prince said. “Now he’s saying you just have to accept this.”Mr. Murray says he refused to hire a public relations firm or disaster management team after the Crandall Canyon collapse because he wanted to make it clear that he was one who should take responsibility.Critics say it was another example of Mr. Murray’s outsized ego and cavalier attitude toward industry standards.“In terms of him being the face of this, he shouldn’t have been,” said a spokesman for the United Mine Workers of America, Phil Smith, adding that the Miner Act of 2006 requires the Mine Safety and Health Administration, a federal agency, to be at the forefront of dealing with any disaster. “They could have stopped him.”Agency officials say they allowed Mr. Murray his First Amendment rights to speak out about what happened at the mine.At Wednesday’s news conference, Mr. Murray once again denied that he changed the mining plan when his company took over Crandall Canyon in 2006. “I just continued doing what the previous owner was doing,” he said in an interview.Crandall Canyon’s previous owner, Andalex Resources, thought it too risky to mine coal barriers, the pillars that hold up the mountain and protect workers thousands of feet below. The technique is called “retreat mining,” and while common at shallower mines, it is far more problematic at Crandall Canyon’s depth of 1,800 feet and more.Nevertheless, mine agency documents show, the agency this year approved a plan from a Murray company to perform such mining at Crandall Canyon.'"

But by halftime of Game 1 of the Eastern Conference semifinals last night, the Liberty found itself right where it has been all season — in step with the W.N.B.A.’s defending champion.By the time the Liberty completed its 73-51 victory at Madison Square Garden, the team that looked as if it could not keep up was the Shock.The Liberty, a streaky team of young players that finished 16-18 in the regular season, was already the only team in the league that had beaten the Shock twice this season. After an 18-0 run in the third quarter before a crowd of 9,976 last night, the Liberty was on its way to beating the Shock for a third time.The Liberty, seeded fourth in the conference, leads the best-of-three series, 1-0. Game 2 is tomorrow at the Palace of Auburn Hills. Top-seeded Detroit, which finished the regular season 24-10 — eight games ahead of the Liberty — suffered a rare blowout.“I can’t tell you what happened,” Liberty Coach Pat Coyle said. “We just made some shots.”The score was tied at 25-25 at halftime, and Detroit briefly took a 29-27 lead in the third quarter.

"'07-08-25,'0','Jack McCabe, a real estate consultant in Deerfield Beach, Fla., said that the Savoy project was an example of the problems that luxury developers may face. Typically, he said a struggling developer will try to sell a project or form a venture with another developer to complete it.“This is just the start of the project foreclosures and this is going to accelerate over the next 24 months,” he said. “We’re going to see commercial-owned foreclosures on new condominium projects, condo conversions, condo hotels.”In the case of the Savoy, the lender BankFirst sued Savoy Hotel Partners on June 27 for $4.7 million. The hotel went into pre-foreclosure on July 2.The law firm for Savoy Hotel Partners, Shutts & Bowen, had no comment on specifics of the case.The foreclosure process is a drastic turn for the Savoy Hotel, which started with high aspirations. Two years ago, a Miami Beach real estate firm, the CMA Companies, announced that it was buying and converting the beachfront hotel on behalf of a British real estate investment group.Gary Cohen, one of CMA’s principals, said at the time that CMA would handle the “management, preservation and development” of the building. Mr. Cohen did not return calls yesterday to his work and cellphone numbers.Even as the market started to show signs of overbuilding, developers of the Savoy spared no expense to hire some of the best-connected promoters of Miami and of Manhattan to work on the condo and condo-hotel units.The vice chairman at Prudential Douglas Elliman, Dolly Lenz, was hired to market the apartments. The luxury brand Fendi Casa was brought in to design the interiors, and Allan Shulman, who worked on the Soho Beach House, to design three new buildings.Ms. Lenz said the project did not fail from lack of interest. She said buyers, mainly from New York and Italy, had put in reservations for more than a third of the roughly 100 units and paid more than $1,500 a square foot because they coveted the South Beach location.Prices ranged from $750,000 to more than $7 million, according to Haute Living.“This is on the sand,” Ms. Lenz said. “It’s what everybody wanted.”But Ms. Lenz said that the project fell apart because the developers could not get enough money from banks to finance the construction.“The banks just felt that the whole Miami market was an issue to start,” she said. “The banks were concerned with their expertise and whether they were able to develop.”“I introduced them to every bank on the planet,” Ms. Lenz said. “They couldn’t get financing.”Now the star team that Savoy’s developers assembled has been left behind. The project’s interior designer, Charles Allem, said in a statement that his firm stopped work on the project “when we became aware of the possibility that the project would not be moving forward.”“It’s another unfortunate example of the status of the South Florida real estate market.”Ms. Lenz said that her brokerage firm returned the deposits that buyers had made and closed the sales office this summer. She said that in the last several days she had received calls from potential developers inquiring about the project.'"
"'07-08-25,'0','Major League Baseball’s official cap manufacturer said yesterday that it would remove headwear bearing the colors and symbols of three gangs — the Bloods, the Crips and the Latin Kings — one day after activists protested the sale of the caps at retail stores in East Harlem.Two white Yankee caps made by New Era Cap were wrapped with red and blue bandannas that appear to represent the Bloods and Crips, and a black Yankee cap was embroidered with a crown symbolic of the Latin Kings.The Yankees said in a statement that they were unaware of the caps’ gang symbolism and had no approval rights on their design. “The New York Yankees oppose any garment that may be associated with gangs or gang-related activity,” the statement said.The team said it learned about the caps yesterday and contacted Major League Baseball, which had already taken action with New Era to recall the caps.A report about the caps and the protest in East Harlem appeared yesterday in The New York Post.“Our concern was that parents weren’t aware of the caps and their kids could get cut,” said Stan Koehler, the executive director of Peace on the Street, a martial arts academy and meditation center that works with gang members.Mr. Koehler was part of the group of 20 to 30 people who went to three stores in East Harlem that were selling the caps; one immediately removed them.'"
"'07-08-25,'0','The strength on the West Coast, which has the highest median home prices in the country, also helped lift the national median price of a new home, to $239,500 from $230,600 in June.For the improvement they showed, the July statistics predated the credit market squeeze that has roiled the global financial system this month. Since then, banks have tightened borrowing standards considerably for both individuals and businesses, which is expected to put a further drag on home buying.“In July, people were talking about the subprime problems, but they weren’t talking about it being a major credit crunch,” said Joel L. Naroff, chief economist for Commerce Bank. “Now they’re looking at it and recognizing that maybe it’s not a full-blown crisis, but it could become one.”The effect of the credit tightening — both in terms of its real effect on mortgage availability and its psychological effect on consumers — has yet to unfold.“I think there’s a lot of uncertainty,” said Celia Chen, the director of housing economics at Moody’s Economy.com. “I think potential buyers are going to need to see a little firming in prices. And then I think they’ll need to be able to access credit easily. Right now, that’s getting harder and harder.”The statistics showed that builders continued to hold high levels of unsold inventory. The supply of unsold homes last month fell to 7.5 months from 7.7 months, but that is still far more than the five-month supply that is considered normal. At the end of July, the Commerce Department said 533,000 unsold new homes were on the market, down 7 percent from July 2006.With so many homes on the market, economists said prices could continue to fall for some time. Despite the increase last month, the median price of a new home in July was still lower than the 2006 median of $246,500.The rise in new-home sales last month was out of step with what some of the largest builders have been saying recently about the state of their businesses.Major companies like D. R. Horton and Toll Brothers have reported double-digit drops in sales since last year, sagging profits and soaring cancellations. And the National Association of Home Builders said last week that its index of builder confidence hit the lowest level since January 1991.In a survey of more than 300 builders this month, the home builders association found that more and more are cutting prices and adding incentives like upgraded kitchen countertops and fireplaces to sell homes. Fifty-three percent of builders said they had cut prices in the last month, compared with 37 percent a year earlier. Forty-seven percent are paying financing fees and mortgage closing costs for buyers, compared with 38 percent a year earlier. The percentage of builders including upgrades at no additional charge to the buyer rose to 58 percent from 51 percent a year earlier.Because the Commerce Department numbers count home sales when the contract is signed between the homeowner and the builder, they do not capture cancellations. And many builders recently have reported high cancellation rates, suggesting that the July numbers may exaggerate how good the month was for builders.“Given the high rate of sales cancellations that home builders have experienced in recent months, it is difficult to get a line of sight to the net sales rates,” an economist for Global Insight, Brian Bethune, said in a research report.Outside the housing market, there were signs that July was a good month for American businesses. The Commerce Department said in a separate report yesterday that orders for durable goods — heavy-duty items like airplanes, vehicles and computers — rose 5.9 percent in July, to $12.9 billion.'"
"'07-08-25,'0','At the first European Universities Bridge Cup, held in Bruges, Belgium, Aug. 4 to 9, the award for the best-played deal went to Jérémie Tignel, who was on the Paris Polytechnic team.Tignel was South in the diagramed deal, declaring three no-trump after the given auction and receiving a diamond lead into his ace-queen. How did he plan the play?Declarer started by counting his top tricks, his instant winners. He had only four: two diamonds (given Trick 1) and two clubs. He hoped in addition to establish four heart tricks and one spade trick. But South realized that if he led the heart king from his hand at Trick 2, the opponents could win and knock out his diamond ace. Then, when he played a spade, West might be able to take his spade ace and cash three diamond tricks to defeat the contract.Instead, declarer immediately led a low spade from his hand. This succeeded as South anticipated, West playing low and permitting dummy’s king to take the trick. Now declarer played a heart to his king, getting a shock when West discarded a spade. Suddenly four heart tricks had shrunk to three. But South realized that if West had the club queen and had started with 5-0-5-3 distribution, he was coming under pressure.Declarer continued with a second heart to dummy’s queen, West unwisely throwing a club. When East ducked this trick too, South turned his attention to clubs, taking five tricks there and coming home with an overtrick.What happens if West keeps his three clubs?He becomes the victim of an endplay. Declarer continues with dummy’s heart jack, East taking the trick and West pitching his spade jack. Through comes a diamond to South’s ace. Declarer plays a club to dummy’s king and cashes the heart ten, South pitching a club and West a diamond. That leaves this end position:South calls for dummy’s spade or diamond. West takes three winners but then has to lead away from his queen-ten of clubs, giving declarer the last two tricks for his contract.'"
"'07-08-25,'0','The Lincoln Center Out of Doors festival has always had a populist tinge, particularly under the directorship of Jenneth Webster. With free admission and a wide range of dance and music events, the festival sprawls into just about every nook and cranny of Lincoln Center Plaza every summer, encouraging ambling passers-by to stop, look and perhaps even stay a while to watch the goings-on.That was very much the spirit of the 1960s in New York City, which also happens to be theme of this year’s festival. On Thursday, a program called “60s Snapshots” looked back on that era in dance with short commissioned works by four choreographers, performed in and around the South Plaza.The 1960s: a time when you could fall out of an affordable apartment into an affordable seat for dependably provocative theater, at least south of 14th Street, drawn by word of mouth alone. A time when you could watch the world shamble by from a perch on a neon-painted rock in the Psychedelicatessen on Avenue A. A time when anything and everything seemed to happen, on the stage and off.Those days are gone for good, of course, and so Thursday’s choreographers — Gus Solomons Jr., Merian Soto, Yoshiko Chuma and Elaine Summers — could be forgiven for failing to recreate them. Ms. Chuma came closest with “Red Carpet 1967,” a piece in which four dancers walked, vamped and flailed up and down a strip of red that ran along a walkway between the Damrosch Park Bandshell and the little park to its east.Like Ms. Soto, Ms. Chuma’s connection to the city’s dance scene of the 1960s is tenuous. But her credentials are otherwise just right, given her participation in one of the great populist moments in New York dance. (That was in 1988, when Ms. Chuma’s ready-for-anything swimmer-dancers were joined by a hot, impatient captive audience that had finally splashed back into the Astoria pools in Queens after too much free site-specific summer dance.)There was no way to watch “Carpet” with an uninterrupted view, as audience members wandered about looking for better seats and pedestrians cut across to West 62nd Street. It was left to the four jazz musicians (Anthony Coleman, William Parker, Richard Marriott and Christopher McIntyre) who anchored “Carpet,” pouring out their buckwheat-honey music from stationary positions along the path. And so the piece was in effect performed by the dancers (Ms. Chuma, Ursula Eagly, Elise Knudson, Steven Reker and Saori Tsukada) and the city dwellers who formed an ambient and unpredictable supporting cast.'"
"'07-08-25,'0','“Usually, people watch my performance to see if I need a drool cup, or stumble around, or anything like that,” he said at a stop in Palm Beach, Fla. “Usually, people just come and watch me, and I try to show them the energy and vigor that I’m capable of.”To that end, Mr. McCain keeps up a busy travel schedule, crisscrossing the country for fund-raisers and campaign stops, and packing lots of events into campaign days. He is not one to take a lot of downtime on the trail — he is more likely to spend plane rides chatting with campaign aides or reporters than napping, and he fills in the gaps in his schedule with interviews and conference calls and other work. He has been known to pepper his conversation with youthful expressions — “um, duh!” is a favorite expression of sarcasm — and he has appeared on “The Daily Show With Jon Stewart,” which is popular with younger audiences, 10 times, more than any other presidential candidate.Mr. McCain has a scarred, puffy left cheek from surgery that he had in 2000 after doctors discovered his third melanoma, and it is plainly visible on television. His pale skin sometimes looks even whiter than it really is, thanks to the powerful sunblock he uses. And his war wounds — he broke both arms and his right knee when his plane was shot down over North Vietnam, and suffered more injuries at the hands of his captors during five and a half years as a prisoner of war — have left him with stiffness in his knee, and arms that he cannot raise without difficulty.But he still has a trim, fit bearing on the campaign trail. He stays in motion at the town-hall-style events he favors, pacing back and forth with a microphone in hand while parrying questions.Sometimes he can come across on television as subdued, or old-looking, analysts said. Frank Luntz, a Republican strategist who once worked for Rudolph W. Giuliani, a McCain rival for the nomination, has conducted Fox News focus groups gauging people’s reactions to the debates. Some people in his groups used words like “tired” and “old” to describe Mr. McCain, Mr. Luntz said.Age and health have surfaced as an issue in past presidential elections, and political consultants and analysts warned that the McCain campaign must handle the topics sensitively. The risk, they said, is that any gaffe by Mr. McCain could get chalked up to age.“Any misstep, you don’t get the benefits of the doubt: people start looking at you and start thinking of you as a 70-year-old,” said Ed Rollins, the Republican strategist who managed Reagan’s 1984 re-election campaign.Mr. Rollins said that age “was the major issue we worried about in ’84.” It grew in importance after Reagan gave some faltering answers in his first debate with Walter F. Mondale, the Democratic nominee.Scott Reed, who managed Mr. Dole’s 1996 presidential campaign, said he thought that health was a more important issue than age these days.“You have to take health head on, and be aggressive about promoting your health records, showing a campaign style that has vigor, and most importantly not over-scheduling the candidate,” said Mr. Reed, a McCain supporter. “I think McCain has done a very good job in his addressing the issue by playing the experience card.”When the subject of age arose for Mr. McCain on the campaign trail in Ankeny, he delivered a couple of anecdotes he often tells when he is asked about it. First he spoke about how his 95-year-old mother, Roberta, drove herself around France last year, buying a car after a rental company turned her down for one. (“I have great genes,” he told the crowd.)And then he talked about hiking the Grand Canyon “from rim to rim” with his son Jack last August — joking that, “in full disclosure,” the trek nearly killed him.In 1999, in Mr. McCain’s first race for president, he released 1,500 pages of his medical and psychiatric records, providing the broadest look ever given the public about the psychological profile of a presidential candidate.The records detailed what Mr. McCain had told his doctors after his release, including how he had tried to keep his mind occupied during long periods of solitary confinement by recalling details of movies, books and philosophy. They described the extensive injuries to his shoulders, his right knee and his hip. And the records mentioned that in 1968, after he received some particularly brutal beatings from his North Vietnamese captors, Mr. McCain attempted suicide, trying to hang himself by his shirt — something that Mr. McCain seemed to allude to this spring in a speech on immigration.“I know why people want to come here,” he said in the speech, in which he described the risks that some immigrants take to come to the United States. “I once thought I would rather die than be denied my country for one more day.”The records that he released included a battery of the standard psychological evaluations given to prisoners of the Vietnam War after their release. Dr. Michael M. Ambrose, director of the Robert E. Mitchell Center for Prisoner of War Studies in Pensacola, Fla., and Dr. Jeffrey L. Moore, a clinical neuropsychologist at the center, wrote in a statement at the time that “Senator McCain has never been diagnosed with or treated at the center for a psychological or psychiatric disorder.""Mr. McCain also takes care to avoid the sun because he had had skin cancer — three melanomas from 1993 to 2000. So on the campaign trail he sometimes wears baseball caps at outdoor events, or seeks out shade.He has released little medical information since his surgery for melanoma in 2000. His campaign has said that it will release more detailed updated medical information at some point.So, faced with rivals who are younger, but also have put in far less time in elected office, Mr. McCain tries to make a virtue of his age. “I’m not the youngest candidate,” he said in his campaign-kickoff speech. “But I am the most experienced.”'"

"'07-08-26,'0','Floods change the course of history, and the Flood of 1927 was no exception. When the waters of the Mississippi broke through banks and levees that spring, the disaster was enormous. A wall of water pushed down the river, covering the area where nearly a million lived. Commerce Secretary Herbert Hoover raced to Memphis and took command. Hoover talked railroads into transporting the displaced for free and carrying freight at a discount. He commandeered private outboard motors and built motorboats of plywood. He urged the people who were not yet flooded out, such as the population around the Bayou des Glaises levee, to evacuate early, then rescued with the trains those tens of thousands who had ignored his warning. He helped the Red Cross launch a fund drive; within a month the charity had already collected promises of more than $8 million, an enormous figure for the time.Several hundred thousand ended up in new refugee camps, many planned, right down to the latrines, by Hoover and his team. Hoover asked governors of each state to name a dictator of resources-he used the word ""dictator""-and the governors complied. The dictators then managed the dysentery and the hunts for the missing along the floodwaters in their states hour by hour. He and the Red Cross sent the refugees to concentration camps-a phrase not so freighted then as it is today-at Vicksburg, Delta, and Natchez. One hundred thousand blankets from army warehouses were shipped to warm the refugees.Things felt calmer on Hoover's watch. By mid-May, though the flooding was far from over, the anecdotes began to compete in the news with the reports of tragedy. Northerners read in Time magazine that a town called Waterproof, Louisiana, had not proven waterproof, and that its switchboard operators were still working-albeit from new posts, high up above the waters, on scaffolding. Not far from Memphis, Tennessee, bootleggers had also set up shop on high, in treetops. New babies were receiving flood names-Highwater Jones, Overflow Johnson. Now from Memphis, now from Little Rock, now from the Sugar Bowl, the itinerant flood manager, Hoover, wired or broadcast his analyses of the meaning of the disaster. Such flooding, he said, ""is a national problem and must be solved nationally and vigorously."" But the commerce secretary also spent a lot of time reassuring. The waters might hide the land, the crops might be lost, but the mood was now hopeful. More than any single figure, Hoover was succeeding in making Americans feel that the South would be all right again.Hoover was already so famous that his name was a verb-to Hooverize, after the efforts in food rationing that he had led from a post as Washington's food administrator at the end of World War I. Americans recalled that he had led the humanitarian drive to feed occupied Belgium during the war. Now Hoover had outdone himself-and on a home territory whose geographic area covered more than Belgium's. What the public liked about Hoover was their sense of him as guardian, that he would protect them and what they had. If Hoover could win the presidential election the following year, then he might hold back whatever waters of adversity threatened. He was a Republican, like the sitting president, Calvin Coolidge. He would pick up where Coolidge left off-though he might update things, for everyone knew that Hoover, a mining engineer, could do amazing things with technology. One of Hoover's neatest feats-and he pulled it off right around the time of the flood-was to acquaint the public with an early version of television. ""Herbert Hoover made a speech in Washington yesterday afternoon. An audience in New York heard and saw him,"" the New York Times wrote in awe, adding that Hoover had ""annihilated"" geographic distance and commenting in a headline: ""Like a Photo Come to Life."" It was not yet modern television but wired images and the telephone combined. Still, the idea took hold in the minds of the reporters. Under Hoover, it was easy to believe that the 1920s were merely the American beginning.The idea of philosophical continuity from Coolidge to Hoover seemed ironic to one man: Calvin Coolidge himself. The two were party allies. Hoover had loyally campaigned for Coolidge in 1924-indeed, had helped to defeat a Coolidge opponent in 1924 in California to clear the Republican presidential nomination for Coolidge. But Coolidge did not especially like Hoover. In the very period when the Mississippi waters were rushing, in fact, Coolidge's press spokesman had taken an explicit shot at Hoover, telling reporters that the commerce secretary would not be considered for the job opening if the secretary of state happened to retire.The differences between the men had started with small things. Hoover was a fly fisherman. Coolidge fished with worms. Hoover liked the microphone. Coolidge shied away from it. After a landslide presidential victory in 1924 Coolidge had sent a clerk to read aloud his State of the Union address. Hoover ignored politics for the first thirty-five years of his life. Coolidge held his first office, that of city council member in Northampton, Massachusetts, at the age of twenty-eight, and had rarely been out of government since. Hoover was a mining engineer; Coolidge was a country lawyer. Hoover was a worldly American, a blend of regions and cities, the most successful in his field of his generation. He believed in the Anglo-American gold standard, not only because it had made him rich but because he had seen firsthand how it kept the world running, like a grandfather clock. Coolidge was a pure New Englander who seemed to re-create New England wherever he went. The very concept of ""overseas"" was a bit vague to Coolidge. The typical Republican of his day, he supported tariffs in the belief that they strengthened the United States. His failure to recognize the consequences of his policies, both abroad and for his country, was his greatest shortcoming.'"
"'07-08-26,'0','In one of the most closely watched deals on Wall Street, Home Depot reached a tentative new agreement today to sell its wholesale unit to a consortium of private equity firms for a reduced price of $8.5 billion, according to people involved in the transaction.The new price is almost $1.8 billion less than the $10.3 billion announced in June.In what could prove a turning point amid the crisis in the credit markets, Home Depot was forced back to the negotiating table after the investment banks financing the deal threatened to back out. It marked an unusual showdown between the retailing giant’s investment banks and their biggest clients, private equity firms.Home Depot’s board, led by its chairman, Kenneth G. Langone, approved the deal in principle during a meeting this afternoon, these people said. Home Depot’s board is planning to reconvene early Monday morning to complete the details of the agreement, which is tentative and could still collapse.As part of the transaction, each private equity firm increased the amount of equity that it will commit to the deal to $800 million, up from $650 million each. In a major concession to the banks, Home Depot has committed to finance $1 billion of debt.Over the last two years, banks have climbed over each other to lend billions of dollars — and reap lucrative fees along the way — to private equity firms as they have swept up an unprecedented number of companies. To recoup their capital, banks resold the debt as high-yield bonds and loans in the credit markets.'"
"'07-08-26,'0','“It’s not happening,” Agnone said of Strahan’s rumored Sunday arrival. “Absolutely, unequivocally won’t happen. It won’t be Monday, either.”That left the day’s most exciting action on the field. The Jets scored on the first play of the game, a 79-yard pass from Chad Pennington to running back Leon Washington, but did not gain a first down on their next seven drives. Even the term drives served as an unintentional misnomer, as the Jets netted minus-13 yards the rest of the first half.The Giants’ starters moved the ball and racked up yards with relative ease, but found difficulty converting their expeditions into points. They were handed their first points, a safety, on a Jets penalty in the end zone. Kicker Lawrence Tynes, trying to earn the job over Josh Huston, missed two of three first-half field-goal attempts.By halftime, the Jets had one first down. The Giants had 13. And the score was an unusual 12-6, the Giants leading because of a 5-yard lob from Eli Manning to receiver Anthony Mix with 27 seconds left in the second quarter.“Too many opportunities on the field that were left out there,” Coach Tom Coughlin said. “That’s how I would sum it up.”With temperatures dipping only slightly from daytime highs in the mid-90s, and with the air thick with humidity, the starting units slogged through the first half before yielding to reserves early in the third quarter.The game was nothing to brag about, but it was hardly for bragging rights, anyway. The teams revealed little of their playbooks because they will play again Oct. 7, the fifth game of the regular season, when final scores have some relevance.For a bit of perspective, last year’s preseason game between the Giants and the Jets was similarly uneasy on the eyes. In the first quarter then, the teams combined for six penalties, five punts and two turnovers. It was an ugly start to a forgettable game that the Giants won, 13-7.It did not accurately foreshadow the coming months, as both teams made the playoffs.One difference this year is that the Jets scored offensive touchdowns. Pennington faked a pass over the middle, then lobbed the ball down the right sideline to Washington. He caught it in stride, cut inside and sprinted untouched into the end zone.A botched hold on the extra point kept the score 6-0, and the Jets’ offense barely budged again. The first team did not convert any of its six third downs. Washington gained 6 yards on 7 rushes. Pennington completed 4 of his next 10 passes for 10 yards and was sacked twice, a performance certain to add to the restlessness of fans who favor the backup Kellen Clemens.Clemens led the Jets to touchdowns on his first two drives of the third quarter. He completed 6 of 8 passes for 122 yards, 79 of them on back-to-back bombs that led to his 1-yard touchdown sneak.In contrast to Pennington, Manning has looked crisp, and the Giants’ offense found few obstacles against the Jets other than the invisible barrier to the end zone. Manning completed 17 of 25 passes for 146 yards. Through three preseason games, he is 30 of 43 for 287 yards, 3 touchdowns and no interceptions.Yet the Giants settled for three first-half field-goal attempts. Tynes, who spent the past three seasons with the Chiefs before being traded in May, pushed a 40-yard attempt right, then a 43-yarder left. He made his third try, from 40 yards.Adding intrigue to the kicking contest, Huston missed a 42-yard attempt in the fourth quarter.The Giants needed an unusual play on special teams to score their first points. With the Jets punting from their own 1-yard line, Rashad Washington was called for holding. Since the penalty took place in the end zone, the Giants were awarded a safety. And hopes for any style points wilted in the summer night.'"
"'07-08-26,'0','In recent years, many families used their homes as a kind of piggy bank, borrowing against their equity and increasing their spending more rapidly than their income was rising. A recent research paper co-written by the vice chairman of the Federal Reserve said that the rise in home prices was the primary reason that consumer borrowing has soared since 2001.Now, however, that financial cushion is disappearing for many families. “We are having to start from scratch and rebuild for a down payment,” said Kenneth Schauf, who expects to lose money on a condominium in Chicago he and his wife bought in 2004 and have been trying to sell since last summer. “We figured that a home is the place to build your wealth, and now it’s going on three years and we are back to square one.”On an inflation-adjusted basis, the national median price — the level at which half of all homes are more expensive and half are less — is not likely to return to its 2007 peak for more than a decade, according to Moody’s Economy.com, a research firm.Unless the real estate downturn is much worse than economists are expecting, the declines will not come close to erasing the increases of the last decade. And for many families who do not plan to move, the year-to-year value of their house matters little. The drop is, of course, good news for home buyers.It does, however, contradict the widely held notion that there is no such thing as a nationwide housing slump. A 2004 report jointly written by the top economists at five organizations — the industry groups for real estate agents, home builders and community bankers, as well as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the large government-sponsored backers of home mortgages — was typical. It said that “there is little possibility of a widespread national decline since there is no national housing market.”Top government officials were more circumspect but still doubted that the prices would decline nationally. Alan Greenspan, the former Fed chairman, said the housing market was not susceptible to bubbles, in part because every local market is different.In 2005, Ben S. Bernanke, then an adviser to President Bush and now the Fed chairman, said “strong fundamentals” were the main force behind the rise in prices. “We’ve never had a decline in housing prices on a nationwide basis,” he added.But Global Insight, the research firm, estimates that the home-price index to be released Thursday by the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight, a regulatory agency, will show a decline of about 1 percent between the first and second quarter of this year. Other forecasters predict that the index will rise slightly in the second quarter before falling later this year.In all, Global Insight expects a decline of 4 percent, or roughly 10 percent in inflation-adjusted terms, between the peak earlier this year and the projected low point in 2009. In California, prices are expected to decline 16 percent — or about 20 percent after taking inflation into account.The government’s index, which compares the sales price of individual homes over time, is intended to describe the actual value of a typical house. Since the index began in 1975, it has slipped from one quarter to the next on a few occasions, but it has never fallen over a full year.Another index dating back to 1950, calculated by Freddie Mac, has also never shown an annual decline. Price data published by the National Association of Realtors, based on the prices of houses sold in a given year, have also never declined. According to the association, the median home price is now about $220,000.Mr. Schauf and his wife, Leslie Suarez, put their condo in the Sheridan Park neighborhood of Chicago up for sale shortly before moving to Texas last year so he could take a new job. They bought the two-bedroom unit in September 2004 for $255,000, with a 5 percent down payment. They redid the floors, installed new window treatments and repainted the walls.They said they expected the condo to sell quickly. Instead, they have cut the price several times and have yet to receive an offer. The current list price is $279,000, though they expect to settle for less.Without the money for a new down payment, they are renting an apartment in Austin. They also expect the monthly payment on their adjustable-rate mortgage to go up $200 in October.Ms. Suarez, who grew up in the Dallas-Fort Worth area, says she is not as surprised because she remembers home prices falling after the oil bust in the late 1980s. “Growing up in Texas, real estate has never been a windfall,” she said. “For me, I always just wanted to break even.”Housing prices have previously declined for long stretches in various regions. Most recently, prices fell in California and in the Northeast during the recession of the early 1990s.The current slump is different from that one, though, in both depth and breadth. In fact, the national median price rose only slightly faster than inflation from 1950 to the mid-1990s.But as interest rates fell and lending standards became looser, prices started rising rapidly in the late 1990s, even in places like Chicago, which had rarely seen a real estate boom. The result was a “euphoric popular delusion” that real estate was a can’t-miss investment, said Edward W. Gjertsen II, president of the Financial Planners Association of Illinois. “That’s just human nature.”Many families are clearly richer because of the boom. In the Old Town neighborhood of Chicago, the town house that Ian R. Perschke, a technology consultant, and Jennifer Worstell, a lawyer, bought in late 2004 has appreciated more than 30 percent, they estimated. The gain was big enough to allow them to take out a larger mortgage and renovate two rental units in the house. But Mr. Perschke said he understood that he was “not going to see that appreciation over the next three years.”Prices in Chicago peaked in September 2006 and have since dipped 1.7 percent, according to the Case-Shiller home-price index, which is tabulated by MacroMarkets, a research firm.For all the attention that the uninterrupted growth in national house prices received, some economists argue that it was misplaced. The Case-Shiller index, which many experts consider more accurate than the government measure, did show a drop in prices in the early 1990s. (Unlike the government’s measure, it includes mortgages of more than $417,000, which are not held by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac.)After adjusting for inflation — the most meaningful way to look at any price, economists say — even the government’s index fell in the early 1990s.Dean Baker, an economist in Washington who has been arguing for the last five years that houses were overvalued, said the idea that house prices could go only up had fed the bubble.“It was very misleading,” said Mr. Baker, co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research, a liberal research group. There are a lot of people, he said, who bought “homes at hugely inflated prices who are going to take a hit. You also have a lot of people who borrowed against those inflated prices.”Perhaps the most prominent housing booster was David Lereah, the chief economist at the National Association of Realtors until April. In 2005, he published a book titled, “Are You Missing the Real Estate Boom?” In 2006, it was updated and rereleased as “Why the Real Estate Boom Will Not Bust.” This year, Mr. Lereah published a new book, “All Real Estate Is Local.”In an interview, Mr. Lereah, now an executive at Move Inc., which operates a real estate Web site, acknowledged he had gotten it wrong, saying he did not fully realize how loose lending standards had become and how quickly they would tighten up again this summer. But he argued that many of his critics have also been proved wrong, because they were bearish as early as 2002.“The bears were bears way too early, and the bulls were bulls too late,” he said. “You need to know when you are straying from fundamentals. It’s hard, when you are in the middle of the storm, to know.”'"
"'07-08-26,'0','Although common farmers make comparatively little from the trade, opium is a major source of financing for the Taliban, who gain public support by protecting farmers’ fields from eradication, according to American officials. They also receive a cut of the trade from traffickers they protect.In Taliban-controlled areas, traffickers have opened more labs that process raw opium into heroin, vastly increasing its value. The number of drug labs in Helmand rose to roughly 50 from 30 the year before, and about 16 metric tons of chemicals used in heroin production have been confiscated this year.The Western officials said countrywide production had increased from 2006 to 2007, but they did not know the final United Nations figure. They estimated a countrywide increase of 10 to 30 percent.The new survey showed positive signs as well, officials said.The sharp drop in poppy production in the north is likely to make this year’s countrywide increase smaller than the growth in 2006. Last year, a 160 percent increase in Helmand’s opium crop fueled a 50 percent nationwide increase. Afghanistan produced a record 6,100 metric tons of opium poppies last year, 92 percent of the world’s supply.Here in Helmand, the breadth of the poppy trade is staggering. A sparsely populated desert province twice the size of Maryland, Helmand produces more narcotics than any country on earth, including Myanmar, Morocco and Colombia. Rampant poverty, corruption among local officials, a Taliban resurgence and spreading lawlessness have turned the province into a narcotics juggernaut.Poppy prices that are 10 times higher than those for wheat have so warped the local economy that some farmhands refused to take jobs harvesting legal crops this year, local farmers said. And farmers dismiss the threat of eradication, arguing that so many local officials are involved in the poppy trade that a significant clearing of crops will never be done.American and British officials say they have a long-term strategy to curb poppy production. About 7,000 British troops and Afghan security forces are gradually extending the government’s authority in some areas, they said. The British government is spending $60 million to promote legal crops in the province, and the United States Agency for International Development is mounting a $160 million alternative livelihoods program across southern Afghanistan, most of it in Helmand.Loren Stoddard, director of the aid agency’s agriculture program in Afghanistan, cited American-financed agricultural fairs, the introduction of high-paying legal crops and the planned construction of a new industrial park and airport as evidence that alternatives were being created.Mr. Stoddard, who helped Wal-Mart move into Central America in his previous posting, predicted that poppy production had become so prolific that the opium market was flooded and prices were starting to drop. “It seems likely they’ll have a rough year this year,” he said, referring to the poppy farmers. “Labor prices are up and poppy prices are down. I think they’re going to be looking for new things.”On Wednesday, Mr. Stoddard and Rory Donohoe, the director of the American development agency’s Alternative Livelihoods program in southern Afghanistan, attended the first “Helmand Agricultural Festival.” The $300,000 American-financed gathering in Lashkar Gah was an odd cross between a Midwestern county fair and a Central Asian bazaar, devised to show Afghans an alternative to poppies.Under a scorching sun, thousands of Afghan men meandered among booths describing fish farms, the dairy business and drip-irrigation systems. A generator, cow and goat were raffled off. Wizened elders sat on carpets and sipped green tea. Some wealthy farmers seemed interested. Others seemed keen to attend what they saw as a picnic.When Mr. Stoddard and Mr. Donohoe arrived, they walked through the festival surrounded by a three-man British and Australian security team armed with assault rifles. “Who won the cow? Who won the cow?” shouted Mr. Stoddard, 38, a burly former food broker from Provo, Utah. “Was it a girl or a guy?”After Afghans began dancing to traditional drum and flute music, Mr. Donohoe, 29, from San Francisco, briefly joined them.Some Afghans praised the fair’s alternatives crops. Others said only the rich could afford them. Haji Abdul Gafar, 28, a wealthy landowner, expressed interest in some of the new ideas.Saber Gul, a 40-year-old laborer, said he was too poor to take advantage. “For those who have livestock and land, they can,” he said. “For us, the poor people, there is nothing.”Local officials said all the development programs would fail without improved security.Assadullah Wafa, Helmand’s governor, said four of Helmand’s 13 districts were under Taliban control. Other officials put the number at six.Mr. Wafa, who eradicated far fewer acres than the governor of neighboring Kandahar Province, promised to improve eradication in Helmand next year. He also called for Western countries to decrease the demand for heroin.“The world is focusing on the production side, not the buying side,” he said.The day after the agricultural fair, Mr. Stoddard and Mr. Donohoe gave a tour of a $3 million American project to clear a former Soviet airbase on the outskirts of town and turn it into an industrial park and civilian airport.Standing near rusting Soviet fuel tanks, the two men described how pomegranates, a delicacy in Helmand for centuries, would be flown out to growing markets in India and Dubai. Animal feed would be produced from a local mill, marble cut and polished for construction.“Once we get this air cargo thing going,” Mr. Stoddard said, “it will open up the whole south.”That afternoon, they showed off a pilot program for growing chili peppers on contract for a company in Dubai. “These kinds of partnerships with private companies are what we want here,” said Mr. Donohoe, who has a Master’s in Business Administration from Georgetown University. “We’ll let the market drive it.”As the Americans toured the farm, they were guarded by eight Afghans and three British and Australian guards. The farm itself had received guards after local villagers began sneaking in at night and stealing produce. Twenty-four hours a day, 24 Afghan men with assault rifles staff six guard posts that ring the farm, safeguarding chili peppers and other produce.“Some people would say that security is so bad that you can’t do anything,” Mr. Donohoe said. “But we do it.”Mr. Wafa, though, called the American reconstruction effort too small and “low quality.”“There is a proverb in Afghanistan,” he said. “By one flower we cannot mark spring.”'"
"'07-08-26,'0','The stock market bounced back last week, with the three major indexes all posting weekly gains of more than 2 percent.In fact, it was the best performance for the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index since March. An important measure of stock-market volatility, the Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index, or VIX, dropped 31 percent during the week, its biggest weekly decline since the index started in 1990, according to Bloomberg News.The stock gains on Wall Street were mirrored in markets around the world, which have been bolstered by the efforts of central banks to stabilize the financial system after the shocks set off by the subprime mortgage crisis in the United States.For the week, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 299.79 points, or 2.3 percent, to close at 13,378.87.

"'07-08-26,'0','They did not have to make it this hard on themselves. All of U.S.C.’s running backs were highly recruited. The freshmen could have signed elsewhere. The seniors could have transferred. Just across town, U.C.L.A. could really use another ball carrier.“Any one of us could go to any other school in the country and start,” the senior tailback Hershel Dennis said. “But we come here to grind it out.”In addition to speed and strength, a U.S.C. tailback must possess extreme levels of self-confidence. Need to beat out nine all-Americans just to get on the field? No sweat. Need to beat out another wave of all-Americans coming in next year? Not a problem.From the moment Dennis arrived on campus, he was behind somebody. First, it was Sultan McCullough and Justin Fargas. Then it was Reggie Bush and LenDale White. Now, as a sixth-year senior, he is fighting off Chauncey Washington and C. J. Gable.“Life is competition,” Dennis said. “It keeps you on your toes.”When Dennis studies the depth chart, he is reminded of his Pop Warner team, the Tri-City Falcons, which had so many gifted runners that it used the Wing-T offense, with three tailbacks on the field at a time. If only U.S.C. could run the Wing-T.But the No. 1 Trojans are not exactly hurting in the passing game, either. Their quarterback, John David Booty, is a Heisman Trophy contender. Their receivers are 6-foot-3, 6-4 and 6-5. And their defense figures to be the team’s real strength.“We’re stacked everywhere,” the sophomore tailback Allen Bradford said. “It doesn’t really make a difference what position you play.”At least, that was Bradford’s rationale last season, when he made a baffling career choice. After entering U.S.C. as a safety, Bradford decided that he too wanted to be a running back. He did not mind that nine others had the same idea.Bradford is gambling his future, not to mention his pocket money. The running backs, addicted to competition, have started a friendly pool in which anyone who commits a fumble or drops a pass during practice is fined a couple of dollars.Predictably, the pool is winner-take-all. At the end of the season, whoever has been docked the least amount of money gets to keep the pot. Asked who has dropped the most cash so far, Bradford said, “Joe McKnight — almost $12.”For McKnight, any mistake counts as a new experience. Last year, he was the most celebrated high school running back in the country. He could have gone to Louisiana State University, near his home, and been guaranteed heavy playing time as a freshman.Instead, he went more than a thousand miles away, to the place that makes no promises.“Every school has a lot of tailbacks,” McKnight said. “It just so happened I picked the school with 10.”McKnight apparently did not stop to consider the obvious: that Tailback U. has too many tailbacks, that some of them will never get off the bench, and that they will eventually have to give up and go elsewhere if they want to play.“I’m not going to leave,” McKnight said. “I’m not going to transfer, no matter what the circumstances.”Emmanuel Moody sounded just as resolute last fall, when he arrived at U.S.C. from Texas. Like McKnight, Moody was far from home. Like McKnight, Moody was compared to Bush. Moody left U.S.C. last week, complaining that he had been forgotten.Just like that, 10 tailbacks became 9.Last season, U.S.C. tried to please everybody, using one of those ill-fated running back committees. No player averaged more than 60 yards rushing a game, and the Trojans failed to crack 100 yards on the ground against Oregon State and U.C.L.A., losing both games.How the coaches sort out their crowded backfield this season — and who they choose as their every-down guy — could determine whether the Trojans win the national championship.Regardless, U.S.C. should have the best collection of scout-team running backs in college football history. One or two of them will sit out the season as a redshirt. A few will play on special teams. And a couple will actually get to carry the ball.It is McNair’s responsibility to keep all the running backs motivated while anointing one or two. His job is not as cushy as it sounds. Usually, position coaches have to deal with a few unhappy parents. McNair could have to deal with 16 of them.He has been on the other side of the conversation. McNair was a running back with the Kansas City Chiefs in the early 1990s, when they had Christian Okoye, Barry Word and Harvey Williams. McNair was not as acclaimed, but he outlasted them all.Just the same, when McNair went to the Houston Oilers in 1994, he immediately had a falling out with his offensive coordinator and was banished to the scout team. But McNair also outlasted that coordinator and became part of the Oilers’ rotation.“So you never know what is going to happen in your career,” McNair said. “The mind-set has to be: I’m going to find a way onto that field. I’m going to carve out a way.”McNair encourages his charges to learn other skills — how to return kickoffs, how to cover punts — anything to get on the field. He said it was possible for a sixth-string tailback to stay at U.S.C., not start a game and still be drafted into the N.F.L.“It’s hard to leave me, man,” McNair said. “It’s hard to leave my meeting room.”Never mind that his meeting room is about as packed as the Coliseum at kickoff.“No,” McNair corrected. “We’ve still got a couple of empty seats.”'"
"'07-08-26,'0','Or will it be her Swedish cameraman, the senator’s formidable wife, the singing nun, the larcenous maid or the nosy bellboy?The reason the answer matters is that the nerdy Mr. Gladney is the author of an incipient bestseller, “Marriage Is Forever,” which he and his wife are plugging that very night on Pam Blair’s talk show. And since their own marriage is kaput, all the traffic in their hotel room threatens to expose the book as a fraud.The room, designed by Ken Larson with the blandly beige good taste that prevails in nice hotels, is provided with all the essentials for farce: three entrances, one window, a closet and, most crucially, a bed. This last furnishes not just the possibility of hanky-panky but also several useful hiding places (keep your eye on those bedclothes).The director, James Glossman, quite rightly keeps the good taste to a minimum. Mr. Adamson as the cartoonish senator cavorts in American-flag boxer shorts — when he isn’t in overalls and an Amish-style beard as the cameraman or in a lipstick-red suit as the senator’s wife. Ms. Zazzi’s bimbo flounces around in a hot-pink slip while her Pam Blair strides about in black.Amazingly, the costumes — even the workaday ones, for the Gladneys — don’t betray the quick-change mechanics that have been built into them, a credit to the designer, Patricia E. Doherty.Mr. Adamson and Ms. Zazzi don’t rely only on wigs and clothing to differentiate their multiple characters. They deploy a broad range of accents and voices and postures. Ms. Zazzi, in particular, is a candidate for Monty Python’s Ministry of Funny Walks: she’s all slithery seduction as Gwenda, knock-kneed aggression as Pam, skulking crookedness as the maid. But Mr. Adamson gets his share of pratfalls and slapstick routines, especially when the senator tangles with Gwenda.It’s possible that as the run continues, the actors and crew will be able to speed up the proceedings and wring more laughs from the material. But no slam-bang theatrics will change the fact that in “Tour de Farce,” which originated in Chicago with a little known comic named Steve Carell in the males roles, Mr. LaZebnik and Mr. Day depend more on their gimmick than on their wit.The closest they come to originality is Gunnar, the Swedish cameraman. His bleak disposition and high-flown sense of aesthetics — even when shooting through a peephole in a closet — stem from his long-ago apprenticeship with Ingmar Bergman. When circumstances force him from the closet to a less camera-worthy vantage point under the bed, Pam is not happy. “What are you doing under there?” she demands.“Contemplating the futility of all human striving,” he replies.And then he heads back to that closet.'"

"'07-08-26,'0','Even muses have trouble getting dressed. “I’m the type of person who wakes up and has nothing to wear,” says Inès de la Fressange, a roving ambassador for Roger Vivier accessories. Though she was once a model, a muse to Karl Lagerfeld at Chanel, the official face of the Marianne (“It’s like the French version of Uncle Sam except with big breasts”) and the designer of her own clothing line, she refuses to take fashion too seriously. Her style is a simple mix of T-shirts, tailored trousers and cropped jackets, worn with piles of accessories and a sense of humor. “I’ve always been the bouffon du roi,” or court jester, she says. “One time, before I walked onto a runway, I burned the top of a cork from a wine bottle and smeared a moustache above my lip.”'"
"'07-08-26,'0','At considerable expense two of the show’s main set pieces were installed in the theater: a 15-foot-long treadmill platform and a 50-foot long pool, hung from the ceiling, where it can be raised and lowered to just above spectators’ heads. Designers spent a year creating the set, which will take nearly two months to install, said Bradley Thompson, the show’s United States technical supervisor. An assistant on a laptop controlled the treadmill, which moved at more than a quarter-mile a minute.Jason Novak, a muscle-bound 38-year-old, was next up. Mr. Novak was among the oldest people to audition, but he knew what he was in for; he performed in “De La Guarda” for four and a half years. Wearing a harness around his legs that was connected to the ceiling, he climbed atop the spotlighted platform.“You seem a little stiff,” Mr. James counseled. “Breathe. Relax. Don’t try to reach now something you need a lot of work to reach.”The treadmill began to move, and Mr. Novak was immediately running hard, his jaw trembling with the effort. When it came time for the stumble, he didn’t recover fast enough, and he wound up suspended in the air, his feet dangling, running on nothing.“It’s O.K., it’s O.K., you have to do it once,” Mr. James said understandingly. Then emphatically, “Once.”On his next attempt Mr. Novak nailed it, and everyone watching broke into applause. After a half-dozen more tries, it was on to the next candidate, who had been doing jumping handstands in a corner to warm up.The competition was tough. Though 27 of the 132 who auditioned had appeared in “De La Guarda,” Mr. James, who performed in the show as well as directed it, was not playing favorites.“On the one hand, it was going to be easier if I say, let’s go to these old people that we know are good,” he said in an interview. “But it was more exiting to see new people.” And New York offered a surfeit of candidates. “It was so much better than what I was expecting,” he said, though it did make the casting process more difficult.After a short break it was the women’s turn to audition. The show has five sections, including the running platform; a dancing element, based on Murga, part of the wild spectacle of Carnaval; and the pool, in which only the women perform.Clad in powder blue bikinis, four climbed a ladder up to the pool, which has a transparent bottom. It’s held aloft by giant springs; the small amount of water puddles in the center. Fully lighted, it casts lovely, daydreamy shadows on the theater floor.Positioned in each corner, the women waited for their cue. Then they executed an elevated aquatic ballet, diving and sliding in like porpoises. Sometimes they flopped down so all the liquid reverberated; sometimes they created whirlpools with their bodies. At the end of the routine they plunged in to form a starfish shape, a wash of legs and arms and breasts and hair. “Be careful,” Mr. James warned. “I don’t want you to crash into each other.”One actress, Brooke Miyasaki, prepared for her entrance. “If you walk with a little bouncing, you will see that the water reacts differently,” the director instructed her. She listened, and moved around the pool, trailing water like a meteorite tail. At another moment she was under water, her face pressed against the bottom of the pool, her mouth moving obliquely. Then she stood and ran.“I have to feel that you are laughing and talking with us,” Mr. James explained, “and then suddenly, because something is happening, you have to leave — boom.” Ms. Miyasaki tried again.The ability to communicate emotion amidst the physicality was a central factor in choosing performers, Mr. James said later. “They have to be very expressive,” he said. “We use a big emotional range doing this show. You can find someone who is very good at being at 100 percent of their energy, but when they need to slow down and be really soft and subtle, they can’t. It’s very hard to find.”Physical prowess did not guarantee a spot, either. “I don’t like to start from the skills,” Mr. James said. “I don’t want you to say, like in the circus: ‘Oh, that is incredible. That is so difficult to do.’ It’s the opposite feeling. I want you to say, ‘I can do that.’ Maybe they are doing things that are very difficult, but they have to look easy.”At the end of the auditions Mr. James and his team gathered around a table, poring over lists and résumés and Polaroids. The weeklong process came down to one word, circled by the name of each person who was chosen: Si.'"
"'07-08-26,'0','I consider myself a worker,” said David Greenspan, who has been an actor, writer and director in New York for nearly 30 years. “I’m facing the same things that workers are facing throughout the country.”Mr. Greenspan is right of course. It really doesn’t matter whether you write plays or pave highways when you’re buying groceries. But there is a notable, and curious, difference. Every night thousands of theatergoers fill seats in Manhattan to watch theater people at work for a couple of hours, without really thinking of it as work.But it is work, work that is supposed to pay rent, buy food and sustain people (and in some cases families) for the long periods of anxious unemployment that are an inevitable part of a performer’s life. Given what stage actors make and what New York costs, staying afloat has always required improvisation, shrewdness, discipline, luck and a kind of obstinacy that some people call passion and others call craziness, and is probably a little bit of both.But these days it is harder than ever. Government support for the arts is meager, leaving nonprofit theaters squeezed and scrambling to cut expenses — and cast sizes — while the cost of living in New York has skyrocketed. What follows (see links above) are five working New York City theater professionals talking about the part of the show business life that happens offstage.'"
"'07-08-26,'0','BEN HARPER wants you to know he’s with the band. That is, the Innocent Criminals, with whom he has been performing for more than a decade. Mr. Harper’s eighth studio album, “Lifeline” (Virgin), due out this week, was a collaborative effort. The band created the music during sound checks before tour performances; then Mr. Harper would retire to his hotel and add lyrics. After wrapping up the last show, they ended up recording in a 16-track studio in Paris. Mr. Harper, 37, described the record as “not rock, not folk, not gospel, but with all those elements included.” While on vacation in Sardinia, he spoke with Winter Miller about what he likes listening to.“Modern Times” (Columbia) is a wicked record. The great thing is, he’s still putting pen to paper. If you can have a song like “Blowin’ in the Wind” in the ’60s and have a song like “When the Deal Goes Down” in 2006, you’re having an unprecedented run of writing consistently incredible songs. I hate to wax poetic, I annoy myself to no end. I want to talk about how haunting this record is, but it also moves, it jumps. He takes you through a lot of different moods. There are lines in this record where he’s turning a phrase with a vengeance. I’m going: “How is it possible that that phrase could be used in the English language and I’ve never heard it? How is that possible?” It spun me around, like, “Wait a minute, it’s never been said like that.” For him to be pulling that off for this long .... I don’t get caught in the history. This isn’t a nostalgic trip. If any musician turned these phrases, I’d say people need to take notice.The lyrical prowess with the sense of melody, the depth of honesty with levity, the soulfulness with hauntedness — it’s all the stuff I want to listen to. “I Taught Myself How to Grow Old” is possibly the most honest song I’ve ever heard. The production is a symphony with harmonica and this haunted vocal and this beautifully finger-picked guitar. You hear it and you say: “That’s the core. People aren’t supposed to be that honest.” I was first pulled in when a friend first gave me his disc four years ago. I started listening to everything he put out. I sure have played “Easy Tiger” (Lost Highway) a ton. It won’t leave my rotation; it’s holding. I could go on about him because he’s what modern music — popular music —needs to sound like.I’m a fan, so I get whatever he puts out. “Highway Companion” (Warner Brothers) is super-emotional. Not that “Won’t Back Down” isn’t personal, but the song “Square One” pulled me in. It’s a genius song. When I get a CD, I open it, pull out the booklet and dig into the lyrics. Then the liner notes, to see who’s doing what where, all before I listen to even one note. I’m one of those freaks who cares what people write and say. I don’t even do an iPod; I still do an old-school CD player. My band is like, get a grip, but I stay true to the CD player. You can hear the evolution of a person’s body of music, unlike in a single song. I saw Tom Petty in Austin, and he played the new record; it fit in with the hits without missing a beat. These songs are so strong on here. Tom has great ears. This record was produced by Jeff Lynne, and they’ve worked together before. There are a lot of subtleties about the record. It’s super personal. I was blown out by this record and haven’t stopped playing it.The Nightwatchman is Tom Morello’s alter ego. “One Man Revolution” (Sony) shocked me because he’s from Rage Against the Machine and Audioslave, and this is his first solo work. His lyrics come at you like daggers, straight up. It’s a record Woody Guthrie would be truly proud of and possibly cover songs off it. I saw a gig of Tom’s and was blown away. It’s nylon-string solo acoustic guerrilla folk. His voice is not quite baritone, it’s below a tenor. His singing fits the style perfectly. Songs like “House Gone Up in Flames” and “One Man Revolution,” they stay with you. He’s one of the great guitar heroes of my generation. To hear him on a nylon string guitar after electric for so many years is super-inspiring.Money Mark, a k a Mark Ramos-Nishita, has been the “fourth Beastie Boy” for going on a decade or more now. But this is just part of the story. The cat is purely a soul music assassin. He’s a multi-instrumentalist and plays them all with authority and sensitivity. He writes great songs in a wide range of styles. His newest record, “Brand New By Tomorrow” (Brushfire), is produced by the genius Mario Caldato Jr., who serves the songs perfectly. With legendary guests, including Jim Keltner on a couple of tunes, as well as the bassist Carol Kaye, and G. Love sitting in on harmonica on one song, this record is not to be missed.'"
"'07-08-26,'0','WHEN Matto opened in East Hampton in early June, the menu suggested a restaurant where families could go and not break the budget.But when I visited, two months after the opening, prices had jumped. The pizzetta on the dinner menu that had been $10 was now $15. Rigatoni Genovese had risen to $26 from $18, veal saltimbocca to $29 from $22. The lowest-priced wine, a Montepulciano, was $27; it had been $15.Lidia Buonanno, the owner, said that after “testing the waters” with introductory prices, she had to raise them to maintain quality and portion size.The tab is now on a par with fancy Hamptons spots. So is the light, summery décor, with walls of French doors and billowy white fabric covering the ceiling, accented by whirling overhead fans. A large covered patio beckons. A bar near the entrance is home to a pizza oven, whose heat kept us moving toward the cool, comfortable dining room.Service was casual. Our personable waitress took the time to chat (not always a good thing); when we needed her she was usually bantering with patrons at other tables. Dishes were delivered auction-style, with runners announcing the offering and diners expected to lay claim. A bowl of flavorful chopped tomatoes and onions came with the basket of focaccia and bread one night, but no one offered to replenish it. Instead, a busboy asked if we would like more bread, which arrived, but then he took away our bread plates and knives. We were still lacking knives when the main courses arrived.'"
"'07-08-26,'0','A RECENT Manhattan court decision added a twist to a question that co-op lawyers thought had been answered by the state’s highest court in a 2005 ruling on designating a “holder of unsold shares” in a co-op.The issue is of great importance to co-ops, and to those who claim to be holders of unsold shares, because such individuals enjoy special rights: not paying flip taxes or sublet fees, for example, or selling or subletting without board approval.On March 28, Justice Edward H. Lehner of State Supreme Court issued a ruling in Sassi-Lehner v. the Charlton Tenants Corporation. Co-op lawyers say that if the ruling stands, it will significantly reduce the number of shareholders who enjoy “holder of unsold shares” status.The case began when two sisters, Christina Sassi-Lehner, who is not related to the judge, and Gabriella Sassi-Hill inherited the shares to three apartments in the co-op at 210 Avenue of the Americas, at Charlton Street. The shares had been acquired by their parents at a foreclosure sale, and neither the original owner of the shares, the parents nor the sisters had ever lived in any of the apartments.When the sisters decided to sell, they asserted that they were holders of unsold shares and could sell without board approval. The co-op board rejected that assertion, and the sisters sued.Justice Lehner ruled that when determining whether the sisters were holders of unsold shares, “the crucial cooperative document to determine the issue is the plan,” referring to the co-op’s original offering plan. It requires a holder of unsold shares to be designated as such by the sponsor, and since neither the sisters nor their parents were so designated, they could not be holders of unsold shares, the judge ruled.'"
"'07-08-26,'0','Hedge funds are structured and regulated in ways that give them wide latitude to pursue profit opportunities wherever they find them. Mr. Tint says he suspects that some hedge fund investors will be surprised that their funds lost money because of problems in the subprime mortgage arena. That’s because those investors have been falsely assuming that, just because their funds focused on completely different strategies — commodities, for example — they have no exposure to the subprime mortgage market.“There are today so many interconnections between hedge funds that, on the surface, pursue quite different approaches, that even a minor perturbation in one corner of the market causes everyone to run in the same direction,” Mr. Tint said.Another factor that contributes to rapidly spreading losses, or contagion, among hedge funds is the proportion of their holdings invested in assets that cannot be readily sold. Hedge funds are attracted to such illiquid assets because their expected return is often higher than that of liquid investments. But that higher expected return carries a price: it makes it harder for the funds to raise money when credit becomes tight.One expert who has worried for several years about the risks caused by hedge fund illiquidity is Andrew W. Lo, a finance professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and director of its Laboratory for Financial Engineering. He is also chief scientific officer at the AlphaSimplex Group, a hedge fund management firm in Cambridge, Mass.Hedge funds do not generally divulge their holdings, so the extent of illiquidity must be measured indirectly. Professor Lo does this by measuring the degree to which hedge fund returns move in the same direction from month to month — a statistical pattern that some call return persistence. This is a telltale sign of illiquid investments, he argues, because their valuations typically are updated infrequently — say, once a quarter or once a year. In such cases, hedge funds have to make a number of assumptions when coming up with how an illiquid investment performed in a particular month, and they may simply extrapolate it from past returns. This will have the effect of making an illiquid investment’s month-to-month returns appear to move in the same direction.In an interview, Professor Lo said he began noticing as early as five years ago that return persistence was becoming more prevalent in hedge funds, and that it has become even more so since.As an example of how this measurement could have been used as an early warning signal, he refers to Amaranth Advisors, the hedge fund that failed last September. The particular trade that caused huge losses for that fund, and eventually led to its closure, was a complex derivative involving natural gas futures contracts. Professor Lo said that this derivative appeared to become quite illiquid in mid-2006, as evidenced by a big spike in its return persistence. This indicated a marked increase in vulnerability for hedge funds invested in it, according to Professor Lo.It turns out, however, that relatively few hedge funds were invested in that derivative, so the ripple effects of Amaranth’s failure were relatively mild. But that was something of a lucky break, Professor Lo said. Today, the odds are higher than ever that losses in a remote corner of the financial markets will spread quickly across the hedge fund world.Professor Lo likened his warnings about hedge fund illiquidity to those of a weather forecaster pointing out that a forest has become extremely dry and vulnerable to fire. “Such a report can’t be used to predict when a spark will actually trigger a rapidly-spreading fire,” he said, “but it does tell you that it has become significantly more likely to happen at any time.”'"
"'07-08-26,'0','The problem is fundamental because the speculative cycle afflicts much of the world. Housing booms have not occurred everywhere, but they have been commonplace since the late 1990s in North America, Europe, Asia and Australia.We have also seen similar worldwide boom cycles in the stock market over the last 10 or 12 years. Many countries shared in the huge market booms that peaked in 2000, and just about every major stock market around the world has boomed since 2003.Classical economics cannot explain this cycle, because underlying these booms is popular reaction to the price increases themselves. Rising prices encourage investors to expect more price increases, and their optimism feeds back into even more increases, again and again in a vicious circle. As the boom continues, there is less fear of borrowing heavily, or of lending heavily. In this situation, lower lending standards seem perfectly appropriate — and even a fair way to permit everyone to prosper.Booms cannot go on forever. Downward price feedback sets in. That is when balance sheets become impaired and widening credit problems start to show up.The puzzle is why this speculative cycle has occurred recently in so much of the world. What do all these countries share that drives them to speculative booms?One might think that investor optimism is generated by rapid world economic growth that is using up scarce resources and driving up asset prices. Since 2004, the International Monetary Fund’s real per capita growth figures for gross domestic product worldwide have been fairly high: around 4 percent a year.It is noteworthy that from 1995 to 2003, when these booms took root, that growth figure averaged only 2.4 percent a year. A good part of the extra growth since 2004 has probably been the increased spending caused by the speculative booms themselves.The greatest recent economic successes have apparently been in China and India. Because these are the most populous countries, together accounting for 37 percent of the world’s population, their success has become an international symbol of spectacular growth.But it is easy to overstate their importance. China’s and India’s economies are actually a tiny fraction of world G.D.P.— together only 7 percent. The popular impressions of suddenly rapid growth are thus mostly a perceptual error, like the optical illusions documented by psychologists.The growth of capitalism around the world has caused trust in the social safety net to decline, even in the United States, where 401(k)’s are replacing traditional pensions.People worry that they must increase their wealth to fend for themselves. One might think that this lack of trust would promote much precautionary saving, but world savings rates are not high over all. It has generally fit in better with popular perceptions of the booms to be smart investors, not great savers.As we all try to adjust to a rapidly growing and increasingly capitalist world, we have been trying to discover who we are and how we fit into it. This has meant an enormous change in values.Many people feel that they have discovered their true inner genius as investors and have relished the new self-expression and excitement. Investors across the world have been thinking that they are winners — not recognizing that much of their success is only a result of a boom. Declines in asset prices endanger this very self-esteem.That is why it is so hard to turn around investor attitudes once a downward psychology sets in. The Fed and other central banks do not have lithium or Prozac in their bag of remedies, and so cannot control it.'"

"'07-08-27,'0','But are cover arrangements secret? Most of the time, no. Anyone with even a passing interest in espionage knows about the C.I.A.’s use of the specific cover that I redacted above. If you think you know what’s under that black bar, you’re probably right. Certainly every foreign intelligence agency in the world knows about it. It can’t possibly be considered secret. But it is definitely classified.What about the C.I.A.’s covert action in Afghanistan in the 1980s? Everyone knew about this at the time — in no way, shape or form was it a secret — but it was a covert action, and it was classified. I’m assuming it has since been declassified because I’ve read all about it in books by ex-agency officers that were vetted by the agency. If I’m wrong, there will be some more redactions in this paragraph.There are actually legitimate reasons to classify so much information that isn’t secret. Even if every foreign government in the world knows about our cover arrangements, countless diplomatic and legal problems would be created if we officially admitted that we use them.Official acknowledgment of covert actions would be even riskier. It was problematic enough to be arming rebels in Afghanistan who were killing Soviet soldiers. How would the Soviets have responded if we had openly admitted it? How would we respond today if Iran openly admitted training and arming insurgents in Iraq? We may know their denials are false, but they help Iran avoid international sanction, and they help us avoid being forced to respond militarily.If the government openly admitted various C.I.A. activities, even those that are already well-known, it could also precipitate a great deal of negative news coverage in the foreign press. (It would create yet another public perception problem to admit we classify information because of public perception, which is one of the reasons the fiction is maintained that information is classified because it is secret.)In the end, then, the classification system serves a perfectly valid purpose. It draws a distinction between the information that the government does, and does not, want to discuss publicly. What ends up classified may seem a bit perverse at times, such as when information in the public domain is ruled off limits for publication. But that’s troubling only if you make the mistake of thinking that classified information is supposed to be secret.For former C.I.A. employees turned writers, like Ms. Plame, the vagaries of the system have tremendous advantages. Ms. Plame just wrote a book that the C.I.A. could reasonably maintain was entirely classified. After all, you’re not supposed to quit an intelligence agency and then tell everybody about what you did when you were there (certainly a lot of methods would be involved).But since nobody is really sure what is and isn’t classified, the agency permits publication of a lot of material that could go either way. It seems petulant to sue over a few dates the C.I.A. wanted to take out of a book that it was otherwise allowing to go forward. Ms. Plame was right that the dates weren’t secret.

This includes testifying in front of grand juries, on behalf of the government at trial and even taking a lie detector test.In the statement of facts, Vick said that he agreed to the killing of “approximately 6 to 8 dogs that did not perform well in ‘testing’ sessions,” adding that “all the dogs were killed by various methods, including hanging and drowning.”Vick said that he did not place side bets on any of the fights and did not share in the purses that were won by Bad Newz Kennels, but that he funded the betting and was present when his co-defendants placed bets.“I will redeem myself,” Vick said at the news conference. “I have to.”In a written statement, the United States attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, Chuck Rosenberg, said that although a first time offender would have avoided jail time under the sentencing guidelines, the government saw the behavior of Vick and two of his co-defendants as “heinous, cruel, and inhumane,” and thought they should face more time behind bars.The government required two of Vick’s co-defendants, Purnell A. Peace, and Quanis L. Phillips, 28, who both pleaded guilty on Aug. 17, and Vick to accept an additional provision in the plea agreement that they “indeed understated the severity of their conduct and that a sentence substantially above what would otherwise be called for by the guidelines would be appropriate.”“The parties thus agreed to recommend to the judge that the advisory sentencing range for these three defendants (assuming no prior criminal record) should be 12 to 18 months in prison, rather than zero to six months in prison,” Rosenberg said. Tony Taylor, the other co-defendant, was the first to accept a plea agreement from the government and is not likely to face any prison time.N.F.L. Commissioner Roger Goodell told Vick in a letter on Friday that his actions were “cruel and reprehensible” and that Vick’s involvement in gambling was a violation of the N.F.L.’s personal conduct policy.“Even if you personally did not place bets, as you contend, your actions in funding the betting and your association with illegal gambling both violate the terms of your N.F.L. Player Contract and expose you to corrupting influences in derogation of one of the most fundamental responsibilities of an N.F.L. player,” Goodell’s letter said.Vick said today: “I want to personally apologize to Commissioner Goodell, Arthur Blank, Coach Bobby Petrino, and my Atlanta Falcons teammates, for I was not honest and forthright in our discussions.”He also said: “What I did was very immature. That means I need to grow up.”Goodell said that he would review the suspension after legal proceedings were concluded. He said that in reviewing the suspension, he would take into consideration the possibility of new charges; Vick’s conduct; his sentence, and how much Vick cooperated with the league and the law enforcement officials.Goodell could decide to reinstate Vick after his incarceration ends, or the suspension could continue indefinitely. But if Vick serves a year in prison he would not be eligible to play again until 2009, at the earliest. Vick would be 29 years old.Even if he is reinstated and is available for the 2009 season, he would not have played for two seasons, and would have surely lost some of his speed — his best weapon — likely making him unattractive to all but the most risk-taking teams.The suspension frees the Atlanta Falcons to pursue, before an arbitrator, a portion of Vick’s signing bonus because he is now in default of his contract. The Falcons could also decide to release the player who, only four months ago, was the face of the franchise.It has become clear since then that Vick lied to Goodell and to Falcons owner Arthur Blank when they asked him in April about his involvement in dog fighting. Blank has indicated that he feels personally betrayed by a player he had once felt close to and on whom he had lavished a 10-year, $130 million contract in 2004.'"
"'07-08-27,'0','The cabinet contained several other recognizable faces. But analysts said it contained no surprise appointments that could potentially win over the voters who had handed Mr. Abe’s party a devastating loss in last month’s election in the upper house of Parliament. Defying tradition, Mr. Abe refused to step down as prime minister, despite opinion polls and the urging of members of his own party.“By naming these senior people and faction leaders, Abe appeared to be hoping that the criticism from inside his party will die down,” said Mari Miura, an associate professor of politics at Sophia University here. “But the result is that the cabinet lacks any freshness. There really weren’t any surprises, so I don’t think the reshuffling has succeeded in creating a new image.”Ms. Miura added: “It’s unlikely that Abe’s approval rating will be greatly affected as a result. They probably won’t fall, but I don’t think they’re likely to rise that much.”Yoshihisa Hara, a professor of politics at Tokyo International University, said that Mr. Abe was “compensating for his own lack of power” by appointing such veterans.“But whether he’ll be able to exercise his power now really remains to be seen,” Mr. Hara said. “He’ll be surrounded by people who have had longer and more formidable careers than he’s had — many of whom no doubt believe they can do a better job as prime minister. Abe can’t boss them around.”But, he added: “Abe had no other option. He has his back against the wall. If this reshuffle doesn’t work, then it’s over.”In last month’s election, voters punished Mr. Abe’s scandal-prone, bumbling cabinet. Mr. Abe himself, who focused his attention on instilling patriotism in schools and elevating the military’s status, appeared out of touch with a population more concerned about the state of the national pension and other bread-and-butter issues.Immensely popular less than a year ago, Mr. Abe has increasingly become the object of ridicule in the popular media. He has become the poster boy for someone who is “K.Y.” — a currently popular expression that literally means “can’t read the air” or “clueless.”“I don’t believe there is any magical way to immediately restore support in the cabinet, but I hope to make steady efforts to strengthen government accountability,” said Mr. Yosano, the new chief cabinet secretary.Mr. Machimura, the new foreign minister, said he was confident that a special law allowing Japan’s Self Defense Force to deploy refueling vessels in the Indian Ocean to assist in the war in Afghanistan would be extended beyond its Nov. 1 expiration date.“The U.S.-Japan relationship remains the cornerstone of our foreign policy,” Mr. Machimura said.The Democratic Party, which won control of the upper house of Parliament last month, said it would use its new majority to block the special law’s extension. The party’s leader, Ichiro Ozawa, has long argued that Japan should increase its participation in international peacekeeping missions under the United Nations umbrella, but not as part of American-led wars.American officials have been pressing Mr. Ozawa’s party to agree to the law’s extension, an issue that could potentially open a wider debate over the nature of Japan’s increasingly close military ties with the United States.'"
"'07-08-27,'0','The Home Depot deal involves some of Wall Street’s biggest players. The buying consortium includes the Carlyle Group, Bain Capital and Clayton Dubilier & Rice, and the banks financing the deal include Lehman Brothers, JPMorgan Chase and Merrill Lynch.The reworked transaction raised the curtain on the complicated relationships between investment banks and some of their biggest clients: the private equity firms who shower them with billions of dollars in fees annually. In the Home Depot negotiations, however, those normally friendly relationships quickly turned cold, as all the players eventually demanded heavy concessions from one another.By the time Home Depot’s board reached its agreement, some of Wall Street’s most powerful executives had stepped in to personally negotiate the deal:James Dimon, chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, pulled several all-nighters, ordering in pizza with his colleague, James B. Lee, a vice chairman; Richard S. Fuld Jr., the chief executive of Lehman Brothers, was sending e-mail messages from his BlackBerry at 5 a.m.; and E. Stanley O’Neal, chief executive of Merrill Lynch, was taking calls on the golf course, against the club’s rules.Kenneth D. Langone, a prominent Home Depot board member and a fixture on Wall Street, found himself uncharacteristically locking horns with some of his good friends. And even John F. Welch Jr., the former General Electric chief executive, was brought in by Clayton Dubilier, where he works as an adviser.As part of the deal, each buyout firm increased the amount of equity that it will commit to the deal by $150 million each, to $800 million. In a major concession to the banks, Home Depot agreed to finance $1 billion of debt and take up to 12.5 percent of the equity in the supply company.What has emerged is a tale of bare-knuckled brinksmanship, as the three private equity buyers — Bain, Carlyle and Clayton Dubilier — initially demanded concessions from Home Depot.In announcing the possible repricing of the sale earlier this month, Home Depot said it would trim the price it was offering in a stock buyback, initially worth about $22.5 billion.Even so, the buyout firms threatened to walk away from the deal, declaring that the housing market’s decline had created what is known as a material adverse change. Such clauses are common in deals, allowing buyers to walk away. In this case, however, it was not clear whether the declines in the housing and credit markets qualified as deal breakers.Still, Home Depot buckled and agreed to lower the price to about $9 billion. Then the three investment banks demanded a better deal as well, setting off a marathon of conference calls as the banks threatened to walk away from their financing commitments.By balking at financing the transaction, Lehman Brothers put itself in an especially difficult position. One of Lehman’s most senior bankers, Andrew Taussig, had advised Home Depot on the sale at the same time that it was also providing financing to the buying group. Suddenly, Lehman was turning around and threatening to scuttle a deal it had advised one of its most important clients to accept.Mr. Fuld, Lehman’s chief executive, spent hours in person and on the phone with Home Depot’s management and some of its directors trying to explain the firm’s position. Mr. Taussig was mortified, people briefed on the negotiations said.Because of Lehman’s conflicted position, Goldman Sachs was brought in as Home Depot’s new adviser to mediate among the private equity firms and other banks to reach a deal.Over the last two years, banks have climbed over each other to lend billions of dollars — and reap lucrative fees along the way — to private equity firms as they have swept up an unprecedented number of companies. To recoup their capital, banks resold the debt as high-yield bonds and loans in the credit markets.But when the credit markets froze because of the implosion of the subprime mortgage market, investors started refusing to buy nearly all forms of debt not backed by the federal government.Because of concern about heavy losses in the market for subprime mortgage securities, the stock market has become volatile recently, falling sharply after peaking in mid-July. Credit markets have also been in turmoil. Lenders have cut back on all kinds of loans, not just mortgages but also loans to help finance corporate takeovers by private equity firms.The financial markets calmed a bit last week after the Federal Reserve stepped in with measures to stimulate lending, but uncertainty over the extent of problems in the credit markets have left many investors unnerved. If the Home Depot deal had fallen apart altogether, that might have been interpreted as a particularly bad sign for the market.One potential victim of the Home Depot deal is stapled financing, the practice of advising the seller while lending to the buyers. Though the practice has become almost routine in recent years, it is riddled with conflicts and may soon fall out of favor, some bankers have predicted.Still, by reaching an agreement, Home Depot, the private equity firms and the banks may have saved themselves from a potentially worse fate: years of contentious lawsuits.The stock prices of companies involved in other pending buyouts are near their deal prices, suggesting that investors expect them to be completed as originally agreed upon. However, when one participant in the Home Depot battle was asked what would happen to the next series of deals, he said: “Study what just happened here. You’ll see this movie again soon.”'"
"'07-08-27,'0','MANILA, Aug. 26 (AP) — Southeast Asian countries and China agreed to strengthen product standards and safety, economic ministers said Sunday. The move follows recalls of several tainted Chinese products from international markets.China’s commerce minister, Bo Xilai, defended the quality of Chinese goods, saying 99 percent of his country’s exports to the United States and Japan passed quality controls and adhered to global quality standards.A joint statement issued Sunday by economic ministers from the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations and China, at the end of their annual consultations, said product quality and food safety were common challenges faced by every country. All parties should actively cooperate in improving controls and ensuring quality, it added.“The ministers agreed to urge relevant government agencies to properly deal with product quality-related cases by strengthening consultations with the view to protecting the safety and health of consumers while not impeding bilateral trade and economic cooperation,” it said.Chinese goods have come under intense scrutiny in recent months after toxic chemicals were found in exports ranging from toothpaste to seafood and pet food ingredients.'"
"'07-08-27,'0','PARIS, Aug. 26 — Raymond Barre, a prominent economist who was prime minister of France from 1976 to 1981, died in Paris on Saturday. He was 83.Mr. Barre died in the Val-de-Grâce military hospital, where he had been since April after a heart attack, his family said.Mr. Barre, a centrist, was a longstanding figure in French political life. Considered by some to be the foremost French economist of the second half of the 20th century, he brought a scholarly distance to his political involvement.He succeeded Jacques Chirac as prime minister under President Valéry Giscard d’Estaing in 1976. He had previously served as vice president of the European Commission, working on establishing a common economic policy and currency, and briefly as minister for foreign trade.He wrote a textbook in the 1950s, “Political Economy,” which is still widely used. In 1959, he accepted his first government job, a senior position with an industry minister who, as a professor, had overseen some of Mr. Barre’s university work.Calling Mr. Barre “France’s best economist,” Mr. Giscard d’Estaing asked him to head the government in 1976, after an economic downturn had ended 30 years of prosperity after World War II.'"

"'07-08-27,'0','Sony may be a consumer electronics giant, but its public relations folks aren’t so powerful when it comes to prognostication.Last Wednesday, Sony’s spinsters made a bold prediction about game console sales figures that were due out the next day. Sony said it was confident the figures would show that in July its PlayStation 3 outsold the Xbox 360, made by its chief rival, Microsoft.The actual figures from NPD Group, a market research firm, did not bear this out. Sony came in third, behind the still hot Nintendo Wii and the 360.NPD reported domestic sales of 425,000 Nintendo Wiis, 170,000 Xbox 360s and 159,000 PlayStation 3s in July.Dave Karraker, the Sony spokesman who predicted the PS3 would overtake the 360, told me that: 1. He was only wrong by a bit, 2 . NPD doesn’t provide an exact count but estimates some portions of the market, and 3. No, he would not care to make a prediction about August’s sales figures.The results, in fairness to Sony, do represent a marked improvement relative to Microsoft. In June, PS3 sales were roughly half of Xbox 360’s 200,000.'"
"'07-08-27,'0','LONDON, Aug. 26 — “Please return your seatbacks and tray tables to their upright and locked position — and start reading the advertisement that is staring you in the face.”O.K., you won’t actually hear that last part as the flight attendants prepare an aircraft for landing. But as airlines look for new sources of revenue to offset rising fuel costs, more carriers are turning planes into marketing vehicles, installing advertising in hard-to-miss places.Several American carriers, including US Airways and AirTran, recently started selling advertisements on napkins or stickers that appear on open tray tables. Over the summer, Ryanair, the European low-cost carrier, has gone further, installing advertising panels on the covers of the overhead luggage compartments and on the backs of closed tray tables.Ryanair and the companies behind this advertising say it offers marketers an effective way to reach consumers who have cash to spend and who are increasingly difficult to influence via traditional media like television and newspapers.InviseoMedia, which sold the seatback advertisements to Ryanair and to another European low-cost carrier, Germanwings, says the system provides an average of 40 minutes of “dwell time” during a typical flight. In other words, the only ways for passengers to avoid the advertisements, which are placed behind tamper-proof plastic shields, is to open the tray or get up and stretch their legs. And when they do that, they are confronted with the advertisements on the overhead bins, which are being sold by a separate company, Fourth Edition.'"

These talks did not reach the level of details.” No documents have been exchanged by either side, Mr. Erekat said.The Bush administration has pushed the two men to meet to discuss the shape of a final settlement to bolster the idea of a two-state solution and provide a “political horizon” so that necessary concessions can be made more palatable. The goal is supposed to be a set of principles or outline agreements on major issues that can be blessed by the West and moderate Arab states at an international meeting sometime this fall.But the shape of such an agreement is vague, and Mr. Abbas wants more specificity than Mr. Olmert is prepared to provide. The two men also discussed narrower questions of checkpoints, economic and security cooperation and prisoners, and agreed that their respective ministers should resume cooperation. They also agreed to discuss the smuggling of weapons into Gaza with Egypt and the United States and to set up a joint economic council in mid-October in Tel Aviv with the help of the former British prime minister, Tony Blair.The stakes are high for Mr. Abbas, who has already lost Gaza to Hamas, said Ali Jarbawi of Birzeit University in Ramallah. “He’s gambling, basically,” Mr. Jarbawi said. “Principles are fine, but in the end we want to see what the principles are. If they are very general, it won’t be enough for Abbas. If nothing tangible comes out of it, by November he will be exposed to very harsh criticism from everybody. People are extremely cynical about the whole process. They want to see an end result.”Palestinians, he said, “want to know, for example, that a Palestinian state will be established five years from now, and where, and what is required from the Palestinian side to get there. They want a time frame and an irreversible process not subject to Israeli political changes or moveable benchmarks.”The two men met, as the Israeli news media pointed out prominently, on the 21st birthday of Cpl. Gilad Shalit, an Israeli soldier captured in June 2006 near Gaza during a raid by Hamas and other Palestinian militant groups. Negotiations through Egypt with Hamas, and with Hamas prisoners in Israeli jails, have produced no results, because Israel considers Hamas’s price too high both in terms of the number of prisoners to be exchanged and the severity of their acts. Mr. Olmert is also reluctant to award Hamas such a prize while Mr. Abbas is trying to show that the road of moderation and negotiation is more productive than that of violence and rejectionism.Mr. Shalit’s family lit him a huge birthday cake at a rally in Tel Aviv, and flags and posters calling for his release, and that of two other soldiers captured by Hezbollah, were placed at central junctions all over Israel. Noam Shalit, the captive’s father, said that Hamas refused his request to publish a letter from him to his son in a Palestinian newspaper.Before the meeting, each leader sought to reassure his public that nothing serious would be bargained away.Mr. Abbas told the Voice of Palestine that an autumn meeting resulting in only a “declaration of principles,” as Mr. Olmert has described them, would render the conference useless. “If there is a clear framework regarding final status issues, we will welcome this and go to the conference,” Mr. Abbas said.Even if there are secret negotiations with Israel on a final settlement, he said, Palestinians would have a say in a referendum of some kind.Mr. Olmert, for his part, said that implementation of any agreement would take time and follow the phases of the so-called Road Map, an essentially moribund 2003 peace plan. What Mr. Olmert means is that Israel would not make serious territorial concessions in the West Bank until it was satisfied that the Palestinian Authority was in charge and had cracked down on organizations classified by Israel and the West as terrorist, including Islamic Jihad and Hamas.Mr. Abbas also said he had spoken to Ms. Rice and asked her when the conference would be held, which countries would attend it and what its content would be. She had no firm answers, he said.A senior American official said that the conference remained “embryonic” and that serious discussions about it would continue after Labor Day. Ms. Rice is expected back in the region next month, probably just after another Olmert-Abbas meeting, expected to take place before the Israeli new year begins on Sept. 13.Nimr Hamad, a political adviser to Mr. Abbas, said that “for the past two months, the Israelis have avoided entering into details about the problems of final status,” and that Mr. Abbas was trying to force the issue. Otherwise, Mr. Hamad said, the international meeting would be only symbolic, adding: “Nobody knows if there is a reason for it to take place.""Tuesday’s meeting was cordial, with Israel grateful to the Palestinian police for rescuing an Israeli major who managed on Monday to make some wrong turns and end up alone, in uniform, in the middle of the West Bank city of Jenin. His car was surrounded by angry youths, who overturned and burned it. But the Palestinian police took him to their headquarters and returned him to the Israelis.There remains some dispute about whether the major was unarmed, which would be another violation of Israeli regulations, or was armed and had his gun taken away, which in the army’s terms, is probably worse. In any case, he will face disciplinary proceedings.But had the major been captured and killed, it is likely the Olmert-Abbas meeting would have been canceled.Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni met Monday night with the Palestinian prime minister, Salam Fayyad, and thanked him for the rescue of the major as they proceeded to discuss economic and job issues. Mr. Fayyad said that atmosphere was one thing, but that Israel was moving too slowly to improve the lives of Palestinians on the ground in the West Bank by removing some checkpoints and barriers.Mr. Olmert’s office said that the army was still debating what checkpoints to remove to ease control but not lose it. Mr. Baker, the spokesman, said such a plan would come soon.Mr. Fayyad announced that the offices of 103 charities, most of them affiliated with Hamas, would be shut down for “violating the law” and serving as a cover for militant activities. The order is unlikely to have any effect in Gaza, which Hamas controls.'"

The buying consortium includes the Carlyle Group, Bain Capital and Clayton Dubilier & Rice, and the banks financing the deal include Lehman Brothers, JPMorgan Chase and Merrill Lynch. Goldman, Sachs advised the company on the amended agreement.In announcing the possible repricing of the sale earlier this month, Home Depot said it would trim the price it was offering in a stock buyback, initially worth about $22.5 billion.Even so, the buyout firms threatened to walk away from the deal, declaring that the housing market’s decline had created what is known as a material adverse change.

"'07-08-28,'0','Back in the lineup after having surgery on his right hand a month ago, Utley went 3 for 5 with two runs batted in to help the Phillies cut the Mets’ lead in the National League East to five games.That has been the Mets’ comfort zone for most of the last few months. Their lead had not gone below one and a half games, nor higher than five, at least until they stretched their lead to six games during their series against Los Angeles over the weekend.They are good enough to win the division comfortably but have proved unable to pull away.If it were not for injuries, neither of Monday’s starting pitchers would be in the major leagues. In improving to 6-3, Phillies starter J. D. Durbin avenged a loss to the Mets in June by not permitting a base runner until the fifth inning, and he left having surrendered two runs in six and a third innings. He will stick around another day.As for Lawrence? Probably not.Before the game, Randolph said that Endy Chávez, who has been on the disabled list since June 7, would be activated Tuesday, and Lawrence did not supply much evidence that he should be granted the opportunity to face the Braves’ equally tough lineup Saturday in Atlanta. In four and two-thirds innings, Lawrence allowed 5 runs and 10 hits to send his earned run average soaring to 6.31.The damage could have been worse, too, if Joe West, the first-base umpire, had not thwarted a Phillies rally by calling out the leadoff hitter, Jimmy Rollins, at first. Replays showed that Rollins had touched the base before Castillo’s throw landed in Carlos Delgado’s glove, drawing a steaming Manuel from the dugout.His ejection only temporarily delayed the Phillies’ onslaught.A day after going 5 for 5, Jayson Werth went 4 for 4 and drove in the Phillies’ first run with a double in the second inning. Pat Burrell continued his torture of the Mets by crushing a two-run homer in the third, his 38th career homer against them. In the fifth, Utley blasted a one-out homer to the seats in center field.Stymied by Durbin through four innings, the Mets broke through in the fifth, scoring twice with two outs on hits by Lo Duca and, of all people, Lawrence. He batted despite pitching himself into trouble throughout. His single drove in Lo Duca with, as it turned out, the Mets’ final run.“This isn’t one of those things where it’s 80 percent; it’s 100,” Lo Duca, who went 2 for 4, said of the strained right hamstring that sidelined him for two weeks. “I foresee going all out and playing like I normally do.”He added, “This is the first time in a while that I’ll feel healthy going into September.”This was not how the Mets wanted to open this 10-game stretch against Philadelphia, Atlanta and Cincinnati. Wright, who was ejected by the plate umpire C. B. Bucknor before the ninth for what he termed “a few disagreements over the course of nine innings,” was not pleased about that, either. Wright struck out three times, all looking.Afterward, even though the Mets undoubtedly felt as beaten up as Jean-Claude Van Damme’s character in the movie “Bloodsport,” which was showing on the clubhouse televisions, they understand that time is running out for their competition.“If we can go 2 and 2 here, take 2 of 3 in Atlanta, they don’t move up, and you haven’t lost anything,” Billy Wagner said.The Mets still can split, of course, by taking two of the next three, and the pitching matchups line up in their favor. The left-handers Tom Glavine and Oliver Pérez will throw against a very good left-handed-hitting team, then their best pitcher, Orlando Hernández will pitch in Thursday’s series finale.“Our attitude is no mercy,” Lo Duca said. “Come out and play hard.”General Manager Omar Minaya said reliever Joe Smith would be one of the first call-ups when the rosters expanded. He also mentioned pitchers Jon Adkins and Steve Schmoll. ...

Some members said it was not highly likely that the subprime loan problems would severely affect credit markets, the minutes showed, but if that were to happen, there was a “possibility that global financial and economic conditions could be badly affected.” The nine-member board agreed by an 8-1 vote to keep the overnight call rate target at 0.50 percent. The policy makers maintained the view that the United States economy would probably achieve a soft landing toward the end of the year.'"
"'07-08-28,'0','AMSTERDAM, Aug. 27 (AP) — The Dutch government will spend $38 million over the next four years to prevent both the growth of Islamic fundamentalism and right-wing nationalism, an official said Monday.The emphasis will be on financing existing programs at the neighborhood and school levels for what the government sees as a “growing problem” of the radicalization of Dutch youth, said the interior affairs minister, Guusje ter Horst.The number of racist incidents in the Netherlands spiked sharply after the November 2004 murder of the filmmaker Theo van Gogh by a Muslim extremist, according to the Anne Frank Institute, which monitors hate crimes. A cycle of retaliatory attacks between native Dutch and Moroccan immigrants ensued.From 2005 to 2006, the number of reported racist attacks fell 10 percent, to 265. There were 62 recorded attacks against Muslims and Islamic buildings, the institute said. Ms. Ter Horst said the goal was not to combat extremist groups, but to stop them from forming.'"
"'07-08-28,'0','In many ways, it is stunning that Philadelphia even remains in the hunt for October. Only the players’ resilience and the manager’s composure have given the Phillies a chance to reach the playoffs for the first time since 1993 despite often resembling a MASH unit instead of a baseball team.So far, the Phillies have used 27 pitchers, tying a club record. Two starters (Jon Lieber and Freddy García) have been lost for the season to injury. Two closers (Tom Gordon and Brett Myers) were lost for extended periods. Cole Hamels, the staff ace, is out until at least next week with an elbow strain. Even when healthy, the staff is uncertain in its reliability.Clay Condrey, the closer Monday, has shuttled so often between Philadelphia and Class AAA Ottawa that he figures he has enough frequent flyer miles for a trip to the moon.“If you told us in spring training that all these things were going to happen and where do you think this club would be at this stage, I bet no one would have said we would still be in the hunt for anything,” the first-base coach, Davey Lopes, said.The Phillies have had to scrap for everything, and it was no different in the first inning Monday, when the shortstop Jimmy Rollins grounded to second and appeared to beat a supine throw from Luis Castillo to first base. When Rollins was called out, Phillies Manager Charlie Manuel argued vehemently with the first-base umpire, Joe West, and was ejected.Manuel’s protest signaled just how critical this series could be to the Phillies. And it belied the even-keeled nature that has kept his team encouraged in the faced of adversity.“When we go through rough stretches, he doesn’t feel like he has to yell at us,” Myers said of Manuel. “He’s the same guy every day. Players respect him for that.”Asked recently how they had held together for the last month in the absence of Utley and others, Rollins told reporters, “Duct tape and Motrin.”And glue, he might have added.Rollins has adhered this team with his most consistent season. Batting leadoff, he leads the league in runs scored (112) and triples (15), while ranking third among shortstops with a fielding percentage of .984. He is a contender to be the first shortstop to win the league Most Valuable Player award since Barry Larkin in 1995 and only the second since Maury Wills won in 1962.In Utley’s absence, others also elevated their play. Filling in solidly at second base, Tadahito Iguchi hit .301 over 27 games. On Monday, as a pinch-hitter, he hit a towering home run in the seventh inning. Ryan Howard has begun to recover his M.V.P. form from a year ago; as of Monday, he led the league with 106 R.B.I. and was third in home runs with 34.Right fielder Jayson Werth is 9 for 9 in the last two games. Left fielder Pat Burrell, previously considered by many to be a bust, has hit .362 since July 2 while batting third. On Monday, Burrell gave the Phillies a 3-0 lead with a muscular home run.“He’s picked up pretty much the whole offense,” Myers said of Burrell.“With Utley back, if Burrell keeps his hitting up, it’s pretty dangerous.”'"

"'07-08-28,'0','A recurring question in the recent turmoil in the financial markets has been whether the Federal Reserve would bail out the banks, nonbank lenders and investors who are complicit in the excesses that sparked the credit crisis. Events have overtaken the debate. The bailout is well under way.Earlier this month, as the credit squeeze tightened and the Fed began to inject extra billions of dollars into the banking system, the injections were viewed as standard operating procedure. By midmonth, when the Fed cut the lending rate it charges federally insured banks to borrow directly from the Fed, the move was viewed more as a way to calm the markets than to grease their wheels, mainly because it was of no direct use to nonbank lenders reeling from the credit crunch — like Countrywide, the nation’s largest mortgage lender.But by Aug. 20, one business day after cutting the lending rate, the Fed allowed Bank of America and Citigroup’s Citibank to breach the regulatory cap on the size of loans they’re permitted to make to their brokerage affiliates. Using the brokerages as conduits, the banks will be able to easily funnel substantial sums of money to their clients, like the ailing nonbank lenders.The cap on loans to an affiliate is a tenet of prudent banking. So waiving it, even temporarily, is a significant escalation of the Fed’s rescue efforts. Under normal circumstances, a bank is limited to lending any one affiliate an amount equal to 10 percent of the bank’s regulatory capital. Fed documents released last Friday disclosed that the banks would be allowed to lend up to $25 billion apiece, or about 30 percent of their capital.Compromising the cap to that extent attests to the Fed’s belief that a bailout is necessary to avert greater harm to the financial system and the broader economy.But even if the Fed succeeds in managing the crisis, its actions stir questions anew about the longer-term sustainability of the debt-fueled state of the American economy.And they are yet another reminder that even as officials are quick to try to counter threats from Wall Street, they have yet to make any real progress toward heading off the coming wave of foreclosures, which could rock the markets as early as this fall and create a social crisis on top of a financial one.'"

"'07-08-28,'0','Q: I make my decisions that way. What’s wrong with it?A: In some situations, that demands too much information. Plus, it’s slow. When a person relies on their gut feelings and uses the instinctual rule of thumb “go with your first best feeling and ignore everything else,” it can permit them to outperform the most complex calculations.In the 1990s, I was living in Chicago, where there are high dropout rates from the high schools. People often asked, “Is there a way to know which school has the lowest dropout rate?” There existed data measuring different cues of school performance: the pay of teachers, the number of English-speaking students in a class, things like that.I wondered: could one feed these into a computer, analyze them and obtain a prediction on which high school produced the fewest dropouts? We did that. And we were astonished to find that computer-based versions of Franklin’s bookkeeping method — a program that weighed 18 different cues — proved less accurate than going with the rule of thumb of “get one good reason and ignore the rest of the information.”Q: What was the “one good reason” that got you the right answer?A: Knowing which school had high daily attendance rates. If two schools had the same attendance levels, you needed one more cue — good writing scores — and then you could ignore the rest.Q: You are the author of a famous study on how people use instinct in investing. Why this topic?A: Because intuition often underlies stock picking. Ordinary investors will frequently pick a company they’ve heard of before. We call this the “recognition heuristic,” and it basically means “go with what you know.” I was curious: is this effective? In the 1990s, we interviewed 360 pedestrians in Chicago and Munich. We asked if they were familiar with the names of German and American corporations traded on the stock exchange. Using the names of the most frequently recognized companies, we then made up investment portfolios.After six months, the high-recognition portfolios, on average, gained more value than the Dow and DAX markets and some big-name mutual funds. The high-recognition portfolios did better than a portfolio we created from randomly picked stocks and another made up of low-recognition stocks. Over the years, we’ve repeated this experiment twice, in different ways. Each time, the intuitive wisdom of the semi-ignorant outperformed the calculations of the experts.Q: Have you considered going to your pedestrians for investment advice?A: Yes! I did that once. I invested $50,000 in high-recognition stocks picked by the least stock-savvy group we studied, those German pedestrians. Their portfolio went up 47 percent in six months, as opposed to the 34 percent gains made by the German stock market as a whole. This was during a bull market.A: Here’s an example: after 9/11, many Americans stopped traveling in airplanes and drove on highways instead. I looked at the data, and it turned out that in the year after the attacks, highway fatalities increased by an estimated 1,500 people. They had listened to their fear, and so more died on the road. These kinds of fatalities are easily avoided. But psychology is not taken very seriously by governments. Most of the research about how to combat terrorism is about technology and bureaucracy — homeland security. In this case, educating the public about their own gut reactions could have saved lives.Q: Some of your critics say that gut instincts just aren’t scientific. What’s your answer?A: We study these things, where intuition is good and where it’s not. One should also not overlook that in science itself, you need intuitions. All successful research scientists function, to a degree, on gut instincts. They must make leaps, whether they have all the data or not. And at a certain moment, having the data doesn’t help them, but they still must know what to do. That’s when instinct comes in.Q: Do you think of yourself as intuitive or rational?A: Both. In my scientific work, I have hunches. I can’t explain always why I think a certain path is the right way, but I need to trust it and go ahead. I also have the ability to check these hunches and find out what they are about. That’s the science part. Now, in private life, I rely on instinct. For instance, when I first met my wife, I didn’t do computations. Nor did she.Q: Shakespeare’s “Hamlet” is about a young man who doesn’t respond to his first best instinct, which is to avenge his father’s murder by killing his uncle. If Hamlet had listened to his gut, how would the play be different?A: This is not a scientific kind of question. But the play would have been shorter and probably fewer people would have been killed.'"
"'07-08-28,'0','Gestational diabetes may be associated with a substantially increased risk for pancreatic cancer, a new study has found.As a pregnancy progresses, the action of insulin is blocked because of weight gain and the release of certain hormones. Most women can compensate with increased secretions of insulin, but in the United States about 7 percent become diabetic for the duration of the pregnancy. Gestational diabetes can endanger the fetus, and it increases the mother’s risk for type 2 diabetes.Researchers studied 37,926 women in Israel who gave birth from 1964 to 1976. By linking birth data to the Israel Cancer Registry, they found that among 410 women with gestational diabetes, five had cases of pancreatic cancer diagnosed 14 to 35 years later, more than seven times the rate of those without gestational diabetes.“I want to emphasize that this needs to be confirmed in other studies,” said Mary C. Perrin, a researcher at New York University and the lead author of the paper, which was published online Aug. 16 in BMC Medicine. “And in any case, the absolute risk of developing pancreatic cancer after gestational diabetes is very low.”The prospective design of the study gave it considerable strength; the small number of cancer cases found is a weakness. But the association remained strong even after controlling for variables including heart disease and socioeconomic status.'"
"'07-08-28,'0','It was a Friday afternoon, and half the flights over the continent seemed to be heading for the East Coast, where thunderstorms were turning most of them away. The Delta flight had been instructed to circle over Colorado.With Kennedy closed, the flight was ultimately diverted to Syracuse.There, according to Ms. Reiber, the pilot said: “I’m not going to keep you on the plane. I’m going to pull up to a gate where you can get off, as long as you wait there in case we have to leave. I know you’ve only had cheese and crackers. So I called the Sbarro in the terminal and asked them to keep sending pizzas out until the whole plane gets fed.”At the gate, tables were set up. “The pilot said it might take a while to get everybody fed because this is probably more pizzas than they’re used to turning out at a time, so please be patient,” Ms. Reiber said.Flight attendants helped serve while the pilot made regular announcements from the departure desk about the prospects for getting en route again.“Finally, he said, ‘All right, everybody back on the plane, we have a slot,’ ” Ms. Reiber said.“On the plane, the flight attendants kept saying, ‘If anybody needs anything, just ask and we’ll do the best we can. We’re all in this together.’ ”The two pilots on Flight 424 were Gary Hale and Ty Rhame. The flight attendants were David Evans, Nancy Grimshaw and Melisa Walker.Lynn Casey, a Delta customer service agent, paid for the pizza at the Syracuse airport — and did the same thing for another flight from the West Coast that had been diverted there the same afternoon, a Delta spokeswoman said.The pizza connection appears to have been a trend on Aug. 17, at least in upstate New York. The same day, a Continental Express flight bound for Newark sat for an hour and a half at Albany International Airport waiting for the weather to break. An account of the Albany pizza delivery first appeared in The Albany Times-Union.Doug Myers, the airport’s public affairs director, said he was in his office half listening to radio chatter from the tower when, he said, “The Continental Express pilot came on and said, ‘I’ve been out here for 90 minutes. Anybody know if a window is going to open up?’ ”Mr. Myers and his boss, John O’Donnell, the airport’s chief executive, already had a plan in place after being stranded on a parked plane for five hours not long ago in Philadelphia.The plan was to send out food for long-delayed flights and to keep airport food vendors open late if it looked as if delays were building in the region. The pizzas were on their way to the plane when the pilot had to return to the gate for refueling.“We’d already heard all the talk” about stranded passengers on crowded planes for 3, 6 and even 10 hours, often without food or water, Mr. Myers said, adding,“We decided we can’t let this kind of thing happen in Albany.”'"
"'07-08-28,'0','The density of billboards advertising tobacco products is more than twice as high in black neighborhoods as in white, researchers have found in a review of studies.The studies were selected from an original group of 131 papers if they were peer-reviewed and directly compared protobacco media messages in African-American and Caucasian markets. That left 11 studies of tobacco advertising, 7 of them involving billboards or other signs, and 4 on magazine advertising.Five of the billboard studies reported enough data to figure out the density of tobacco advertising in different neighborhoods. Pooling this data, the researchers found that there were 4.5 tobacco billboards per 10,000 residents in white areas and 11.8 per 10,000, or 2.6 times the density, in black neighborhoods. The data also showed that a given billboard was 70 percent more likely to advertise tobacco in a black market compared with a white one. The review appears in the September/October issue of Public Health Reports.“If these populations are more exposed, we should be thinking about making sure that we’re doing extra public health interventions to combat that exposure,” said Dr. Brian A. Primack, an assistant professor of medicine and pediatrics at the University of Pittsburgh and the lead author of the review. “A specific method for that kind of intervention is the idea of media literacy — teaching people to consciously evaluate the advertising messages that are all around them.”'"
"'07-08-28,'0','Colon cancer survivors with diets high in meat and refined grains triple their risk of recurrence or death compared with those who eat fruits, vegetables and fish, a new study reports.Researchers studied 1,009 patients who had surgery for stage 3 colon cancer — their tumors had metastasized to regional lymph nodes. All the patients completed detailed food questionnaires.In a follow-up of slightly more than five years, 324 patients had a recurrence of cancer, 223 died with a recurrence, and 28 died without documented recurrences.The more closely patients followed the high-fat Western diet, the more likely they were to have a recurrence. Compared with the one-fifth whose dietary pattern s least resembled the high-fat diet, the one-fifth whose patterns most resembled it were 3.25 times as likely to have a recurrence of cancer or die. Western dietary patterns, the scientists write, are associated with higher blood levels of insulin, and insulin is associated with enhanced tumor growth.Dr. Charles S. Fuchs, the senior author and an associate professor at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston, said he did not advise a radical diet for patients. “I don’t tell them they can’t ever eat meat,” he said. “Once or twice a month is not a bad thing. It’s the people who are at the extremes that are in trouble.”The researchers, whose study appears in the Aug. 15 issue of The Journal of the American Medical Association, acknowledge that this was an observational study that did not prove causality.'"

"'07-08-29,'1','Michael D. Griffin, NASA’s administrator, told a news conference at agency headquarters that when an earlier report on astronaut health issues raised the question of possible alcohol abuse before missions, he took the issue seriously because it involved flight safety.“But at the same time, I also have said that the stories cited in the report seem improbable to those of us familiar with the astronauts’ rigorous and very public activities during the hours leading up to a space flight,” he said.Top NASA officials asked Mr. O’Connor to investigate astronaut drinking after a report released in July cited two unverified reports of problem drinking before flights. Those reports were ordered after the February arrest of a former astronaut, Capt. Lisa Marie Nowak of the Navy, who confronted a romantic rival in an Orlando International Airport parking lot. Captain Nowak was discharged by NASA and now faces charges of assault and attempted kidnapping.One of those reports cited two drinking incidents as examples of the concerns of flight surgeons and other crewmembers being ignored by other NASA officials before flights. The chairman of that panel, Colonel Richard E. Bachmann Jr., a physician who commands the Air Force School of Aerospace Medicine, said the review included the anecdotal references to the drinking incidents to emphasize the seriousness of ignoring flight surgeons. The panel did not ask for details of the accounts nor did it investigate them, he said.Embarrassed and troubled by the reports, NASA administrators promised a quick and detailed investigation to see if there was any truth to the cited incidents.Mr. O’Connor said reviewed 20 years of shuttle flight history and 10 Russian Soyuz missions that included an American astronaut flying to the International Space Station. The review involved interviews with 90 astronauts, flight surgeons, NASA officials, flight technicians and staff members working in pre-flight crew quarters, as well as examination of more than 40,000 mission records, safety reports and other related documents.Mr. O’Conner said no one said they had first-person knowledge of an astronaut drinking heavily or being drunk before a flight. “We didn’t have one person to say they saw something,” he added.One of the alleged incidents was said to involve a space shuttle astronaut that a colleague believed had too much to drink. After the flight was delayed because of mechanical reasons, the colleague supposedly alerted others to the problem as the crew was getting ready to fly back to Houston from Florida.Mr. O’Connor focused on three missions between 1990 and 1995 that matched the scant details of the alleged incident and said he spoke with at least two astronauts on each of those missions and their superiors and no one verified the claims.The other alleged incident involved an astronaut who was supposed to have gotten so drunk before flying in a Soyuz capsule that a flight surgeon sat in his room overnight because of concerns his breathing might become impaired. No flight surgeon who covered Soyuz missions could verify the report, he said.Mr. Griffin said as NASA administrator, he is privy to certain information about the Soyuz mission that cannot be discussed because of privacy restrictions. However, he said he could state with certainty that the report was not true.“That anecdotal story did not happen,” he said at the news conference.Mr. Griffin said he did not know where the astronaut-drinking rumors could have come from, but suggested they were just another “urban legend” that keeps perpetuating itself.“There is a Web site for urban legends and stories that are not true,” Mr. Griffin said. “This story is one of them.”'"
"'07-08-29,'1','Part of the problem is that while it is clear that the losses have not fully worked their way through the market, no one is sure which institutions are going to have to book them.“Someone is holding the bag, but we don’t know who,” said John Edwards, chief economist at HSBC in Sydney.The downgrade of big American banks by Merrill Lynch, from buy to neutral, underlines the lingering effect of the subprime problems despite attempts by the Fed to reassure markets.The Nikkei 225 was also pulled down 1.7 percent by the problems in the United States, and the fall was accelerated by renewed strength in the yen, which the markets fear will harm the country’s recovering exporters.In Britain, Barclays Bank was compelled Tuesday to deny rumors that it was sitting on hundreds of millions of dollars of unrealized losses related to credit funds.The British markets got further bad news when the ratings agency Standard & Poors said the London-based hedge fund Cheyne Capital Management might have to liquidate $6 billion in assets backing commercial paper.The decisions by the Fed to cut the discount rate that banks use for borrowing and to inject liquidity into the markets have provided some support for stocks and bonds, but the market in asset-backed commercial paper is still moribund.The subprime crisis was sparked by an increase in defaults on mortgages given to high-risk borrowers. Many of those loans had been packaged and sold as asset-backed securities.The crisis of confidence has spread to include almost all asset-backed securities regardless of how safe the end borrowers are.Potential buyers of asset-backed securities are reassessing the risk that they present. And markets for such securities are barely functioning, with buyers frightened of being burdened with an asset they cannot sell.The Federal Reserve Bank of New York tried to step in last week, telling banks that they could use high-quality asset-backed securities as collateral to borrow from the Fed.But the market is still languishing, and nonbank lenders are having continued difficulty getting money, a particular problem in a market where most asset-backed commercial paper typically has short maturity and needs to be rolled over regularly.Coventree, a Canadian financial services company, was unable to roll over its asset-backed commercial paper and had to be bailed out by banks.And the Australian lender Rams Home Loans Group announced Tuesday that it would turn to the Australian markets to refinance more than 300 million Australian dollars, but it is likely to be an expensive exercise.Borrowers like Rams are having to pay significant premiums to obtain the financing they need.A number of nonbank lenders, like the Australia-based Members Equity Bank, have had to cancel bond issues recently because they have been unable to find buyers at an acceptable price.One of the reasons that banks are being sold so heavily in the market is that they typically offer a backstop in case the issuer of the commercial paper is unable to roll over the debt.It was this arrangement that nearly bought down the German bank IKB.But in a recent report, Keith Horowitz of Citigroup Global Markets said he believed that banks’ balance sheets were strong enough to withstand the extra calls on their capital that might be made if the weakness in the commercial paper market continues.“Our initial take is that banks will have sufficient balance sheet capacity to put these credit lines on, and we do not see anything close to an IKB scenario unfolding in our universe,” the report said.'"

"'07-08-29,'1','RICHMOND, Va., Aug. 28 — The fates of the dogs seized from a property owned by Michael Vick hinge on the recommendations from certified animal behaviorists.Prosecutors have asked the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals to evaluate the 53 pit bulls taken from Vick’s kennel.The dogs, which were considered evidence in the dogfighting case against Vick and three other men, have been housed at shelters in Virginia since Vick’s property in Surry was raided in April. All the defendants have pleaded in the case.Ed Sayres, the president of the A.S.P.C.A., said that because the case was so high profile, the government had taken extra care to keep the dogs alive and save those that were safe enough to return to society.“There is a low percentage of rehabilitation, but the potential is there,” Sayres said in a telephone interview. “I’d estimate that about 10 to 20 percent can be rehabilitated.”'"
"'07-08-29,'1','Two separate reports released yesterday showed that consumer confidence fell this month and that home prices nationwide continued their slide in June.Later in the day, minutes from the Federal Reserve’s policy meeting on Aug. 7 showed that policy makers were keenly aware of escalating distress in financial markets and discussed the possibility of taking action 10 days before the Fed reduced the interest rate at which banks can borrow from its discount window.But the Fed minutes also highlighted the central bank’s reluctance to simply soothe investors in the stock market, and offered no additional clues about the likelihood of a broader, more important cut in the Fed’s benchmark federal funds rate in the near future.The Conference Board, in its monthly survey of 5,000 households, said its consumer-confidence index dropped sharply in August after surging in July to a six-year high.Separately, a closely watched measure of home prices provided additional evidence that residential real estate could be poised for a substantial nationwide price decline for the first time in at least 50 years.The S.& P./Case-Shiller index, which measures prices in 20 major metropolitan areas, declined 0.4 percent in June. That was its steepest monthly drop in five years and left the index 3.5 percent below its level a year earlier.In all, 15 of the cities surveyed experienced a drop. Detroit experienced the steepest slide, with property values falling 11 percent from a year earlier. In San Diego they fell 7.3 percent, and in Phoenix 6.6 percent.A significant nationwide drop in housing prices would aggravate the turmoil among mortgage lenders and firms that own mortgage-backed securities. Delinquency and foreclosure rates have already climbed sharply, particularly in subprime mortgages for home buyers with weak credit, but worries have widened to the so-called Alt-A mortgages made to people who have good credit ratings but have overstretched their borrowing.Yesterday, Merrill Lynch cut its ratings on the shares of three Wall Street powerhouses, Lehman Brothers, Citigroup and Bear Stearns, to neutral from buy on concerns about their exposure to bad subprime loans. Their stock prices all fell: Lehman was down 6 percent, Citigroup 3.5 percent and Bear Stearns 3.4 percent.The entire financial sector — which until recently was one of Wall Street’s strongest performers — has been particularly hard hit since credit markets started tightening sharply last month.“It’s a difficult situation for financial firms right now,” said William E. Rhodes, chief investment strategist of Rhodes Analytics, a market research firm. “Financial firms prosper when there’s a lot of liquidity because they can conduct transactions. But right now there’s not very much liquidity.”Investors had been fixated on the release of minutes from the Fed’s policy meeting on Aug. 7, which was 10 days before the central bank abruptly reversed its hands-off stance toward the markets and reduced its discount rate on temporary loans to banks.The meeting notes show that Fed officials contemplated the possibility of cutting rates in the future if the credit markets continued to deteriorate. But although Fed economists had just shaved their forecast for growth this year, partly because of slowing growth in productivity, policy makers remained more worried about the risk of higher inflation.The minutes suggest that Fed officials paid close attention to the storm signals that had been building in financial markets for several weeks.Policy makers noted that the markets for subprime mortgages had largely dried up, as investors became much more uncertain about the ability of borrowers to repay. Fed officials fretted that the downturn in housing “could well prove to be both deeper and more prolonged than had seemed likely.”But the participants in the Fed meeting also took comfort that people with good credit were having little trouble getting conventional mortgages, noting that interest rates on 30-year fixed mortgages had declined slightly. And they remained confident at that time that increases in wages and salaries would continue to support consumer spending. Business investment looked to be on an upward track.“Recent financial market developments were thought unlikely to have an appreciable adverse effect on capital spending,” Fed officials concluded.The central bank began changing its position just a few days later. First, it joined other central banks around the world by intervening in financial markets to prevent their benchmark interest rates on overnight lending from climbing above their official targets.But the big move came on Aug. 17, when the central bank expanded the collateral it would accept from commercial banks and reduced the interest rate on borrowing from its discount window, a source of financing for banks that is usually reserved for temporary emergency purposes.Fed policy makers are next scheduled to meet on Sept. 18, but it is unclear whether markets will remain calm enough in the meantime to allow them to delay any big decisions until that date.'"
"'07-08-29,'1','He reiterated accusations by officials and American military commanders that Iran was providing training and weaponry, including 240-millimeter rockets, to forces not only in Iraq, but also in Afghanistan, Lebanon and the Palestinian territories. He said he had authorized the military to “confront Tehran’s murderous activities.”“For all those who ask whether the fight is worth it, imagine an Iraq where militia groups backed by Iran control larger parts of the country,” he said.One problem for Mr. Bush is that the most recent National Intelligence Estimate, an assessment released last week, suggested that that is already happening with the tacit consent of the Iraqi leaders Mr. Bush supports.The future of Iraq has dominated Mr. Bush’s recent public events, even as his administration dealt with the resignation of Attorney General Alberto R. Gonzales. It has been a concerted effort to make his case before a new legislative fight once Congress receives a much-anticipated progress report from the administration and the military next month.Although Democrats and even a few Republicans have urged the White House to rethink its approach, Mr. Bush, in his remarks, showed little sign of bending. Administration and military officials have already indicated that any reduction of troops from today’s level, which exceeds 160,000, would be gradual and incremental, not the substantial reductions that opponents have sought.Congressional Democrats reacted with scorn to the speech. “The president continues to suffer from the Katrina complex,” Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr. of Delaware told reporters during a conference call. “That’s when you ignore all the warnings, bad things happen, you continue to follow the same bad policy, and things get worse.”Senator Harry Reid, majority leader, said Democrats would press their Republican counterparts again in the coming weeks for a change in American strategy in Iraq. “The president continues to stubbornly pursue a flawed strategy that has mired our troops in a civil war in Iraq and diverted our attention as Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda grow stronger,” Mr. Reid said in a statement. “Most Americans, and a bipartisan majority in Congress, believe this strategy is not in our national interest and the time for a major change is now.”Last week Mr. Bush appeared before another veterans group, the Veterans of Foreign Wars in Kansas City, Mo., and recalled the anger, humiliation and turmoil that followed the American withdrawal from Vietnam. On Tuesday, he sought to raise the specter of a new haven for terrorists and an Iran that dominated the region, threatening allies and energy supplies.“This scenario would be a disaster for the people of the Middle East, a danger to our friends and allies, and a direct threat to American peace and security,” he said.Mr. Bush did not directly rebut critics of the war, especially Democrats in Congress, but he sought to preempt the coming debate over the success of the troop buildup. He said that the greater military effort this year had increased security even though it only reached full strength less than three months ago.He also noted rare progress on political issues, welcoming an agreement by Iraq’s political leaders to make modest steps toward the benchmarks outlined by Congress to evaluate Mr. Bush’s military increase this year. And he urged patience. “It makes no sense to respond to military progress by claiming that we have failed because Iraq’s Parliament has yet to pass every law it said it would,” he said.'"
"'07-08-29,'1','Carol Tyler of Tyco Animal Control, which runs the shelter and has helped lead the rescue effort, said that as many as a third of the animals had been so traumatized by the ordeal that they were not fit for adoption and might have to be euthanized. “Some of them won’t let us touch them,” she said. “They’re attacking us.”Animal control workers said that they believed that more cats were still in the home, perhaps living inside crawl spaces or the ventilation system, and that they had set humane cage traps.“We don’t know how many cats are still in there,” Ms. Tyler said. “Every time we think there are only 11 or 12 more, we’ll find 11 or 12 in the cages and then some more.”Prosecutors want to pinpoint the number of cats and dogs to determine the scope of the abuse. For that reason, a Municipal Court judge in Saddle River on Tuesday postponed a hearing for Mr. Tamis and his wife to allow investigators time to find more animals and other evidence.Neither Mr. Tamis nor his wife have spoken publicly about the case, and their lawyer, Santo J. Bonanno, did not return calls seeking comment on Tuesday. Investigators have a working theory that the couple, who had filed for bankruptcy twice in the past decade and had a raft of financial troubles, became so depressed that they neglected the animals.The financial problems forced the couple to sell their house at foreclosure, and Mr. Acciardi, who owns two restaurants in Hoboken, saw the home as a potential investment property.In hindsight, of course, Mr. Acciardi acknowledged that he should have taken a tour of the house before placing his bid, which included a deposit of roughly $400,000. But he trusted that the home was in good condition — except for a leak in one of the ceilings — because Mr. Tamis and his wife gave off every appearance of an affluent Saddle River couple, he said.“He’s my neighbor, so I took him at his word,” Mr. Acciardi said. “He works at Merrill Lynch, and the customers he had there took his word, too. I’m appalled. I don’t know what fantasy world he was living in.”Mr. Acciardi, who was vacationing in California when the police discovered the animals, said it was not until last week that he got his first look inside the house, which still reeks of urine and has feces smeared on the floors. He said he became ill when the door was opened.“The smell was so bad that it got in my clothes,” he said. “Horrible, horrible situation.”Like many of his neighbors along Burning Hollow Road, Mr. Acciardi wonders how conditions at the home could have deteriorated so badly.One psychiatrist, Victoria Fetter of Milwaukee, said that such a case might be an example of shared paranoid disorder.“Usually in cases like this, it’s little old ladies or middle-aged ladies who are alone and kind of losing it,” said Dr. Fetter, who cautioned that she had not treated Mr. Tamis or Ms. Stewart and that her perspective was based on news accounts of the case. “Shared paranoid disorder is sort of: ‘Us against the world. We’re O.K. Everyone else has the problem.’ ”'"

Those include agricultural products like frozen pork bellies futures and options, and cash dairy products.Some financial products will also move to exclusive screen trading, including one-month Libor futures and Euroyen futures, and options on futures. Commodities leaving the pits include 100-ounce gold options, 5,000-ounce silver options and ethanol futures.CME also said trading of all foreign exchange futures products would be consolidated into a single trading pit, while the trading of some foreign exchange products would move to Globex.None of the moves affect the biggest products at CME, which are financial futures and options tied to United States interest rate expectations.

"'07-08-29,'1','SAN FRANCISCO, Aug. 28 — Google said Tuesday that George Reyes, the company’s longtime chief financial officer, plans to retire. He will be one of only a few of the Internet search giant’s top executives to have left since its founding in 1998.Mr. Reyes, 53, joined Google more than five years ago and guided the company through its unusual 2004 initial public offering, in which shares were priced through an auction, and through its fast-paced growth. He plans to stay until a successor is found and to assist in the search, Google said. The company said it hoped to have a new chief financial officer by the end of the year.Analysts said Mr. Reyes’s departure was unlikely to signal the beginning of an exodus among Google’s top management. Only a few top executives have left, including Cindy McCaffrey, a vice president of marketing, in 2004, and Wayne Rosing, a senior vice president of engineering, in 2005.Eric E. Schmidt, Google’s chief executive, said in a statement, “Though we fully appreciate his decision to step back from active management, we’ll miss his thoughtfulness, good humor and wisdom.”In the same statement, Mr. Reyes said, ""I know I’m leaving the company in good hands with a remarkable team of professionals that will continue to build on Google’s tremendous achievements.""'"
"'07-08-29,'1','How distant did 2001 seem? “It feels quite a while ago,” Hewitt said. “In other ways, it doesn’t feel that long ago. It’s a strange feeling.”While Hewitt, seeded 16th, is trying to transition back with the top players in the world, third-seeded Novak Djokovic, 20, of Serbia, is virtually there. Yesterday, he quickly dispatched Robin Haase, 6-2, 6-1, 6-3, while James Blake, at No. 6, knocked out the American journeyman Michael Russell, 7-6 (6), 6-3, 7-6 (4).Hewitt was once the youngest No. 1 player in men’s tennis, at the end of the year he won the United States Open. Hingis was the undisputed No. 1 in 1997, when she won three of her five major titles.After her 6-0, 6-3 victory over Mathilde Johansson, she reflected on young players like the 18-year-old Nicole Vaidisova, the No. 13 seed, and the 20-year-old Anna Chakvetadze at No. 6. Each won yesterday, but ninth-seeded Daniela Hantuchova, a relative veteran at 24, lost to Julia Vakulenko of Ukraine, 6-4, 3-6, 6-1.“I see the freshness, the hunger, all that; that’s how I used to be,” Hingis said, shocked by how young she looked in the 1997 photo. “Sometimes the older you get maybe sometimes priorities change.“You look at life differently,” said Hingis, who is here for the first time without her mother and coach, Melanie Molitor.Two weeks ago, her fiancé, the men’s player Radek Stepanek, announced that they had called off their engagement. “There’s nothing to talk about,” Hingis said. “We’re both professionals and trying to have a good U.S. Open.”After her first and only Open title, Hingis could not out-think the booming games of Serena or Venus Williams, or Lindsay Davenport, falling in consecutive finals, two semifinals and then the fourth round in 2002. She retired for three years because of injuries.“There’s days you think that was kind of a nice lifestyle when I didn’t have to train every day six hours,” Hingis said. “But on the other hand, right now I feel like I don’t want to miss a minute off, being out there, being able to compete.”She returned last season and rocketed to No. 6 in the world before sustaining hip, back and femur injuries. “I’m not really thinking about what number I want to be, I want to play the best tennis I can at the moment and work myself back from injury,” she said.Hewitt, who had knee tendinitis last year, said that despite the dominance of Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal, he believed he could win another major, adding to his 2002 Wimbledon trophy.In New York, he has advanced to at least the quarterfinals every year since beating Pete Sampras in 2001. Tennis has offered a constant during six years of personal change, from his split with his former fiancée, the 2005 Open champion Kim Clijsters, to his marriage to Cartwright, an Australian actress.Seeded 16th, Hewitt had a solid summer, losing twice in late rounds to Federer. Coached by the Australian legend Tony Roche and Darren Cahill, a Davis Cup captain who used to coach Andre Agassi, Hewitt has adapted to the bigger hitters by adding more versatility to his counter-punching game.“If he becomes a little more aggressive at certain times and try to shorten the points by coming in or hitting a bigger ball, then he can work on it,” Cahill said. “I feel like his game is getting back to a level where if he steps on the court, he’s not afraid of anybody.”Hewitt is always undaunted, sometimes to a fault. His 2001 title here came with controversy he has put behind him. During an intense moment of his second-round match against Blake, Hewitt shouted what could have been interpreted as a racially charged criticism of a line official. Hewitt was not fined after a review.“It was life changing to win your first Grand Slam, for me, it was just focusing on the positives,” he said.His opponents respect his fire. “He fights for every point like it’s a match point,” said Djokovic, who beat Hewitt at Wimbledon. “This thing that he has — being competitive, battling for every ball makes him dangerous on any surface against any player in the world.”Hewitt insisted he had not mellowed now that he is a father, arranging his schedule around Mia.“I play with my heart on my sleeve, every time I go out there, nothing’s changed,” he said. “I like to get fired up, that’s when I play my best tennis.”'"
"'07-08-29,'1','Wendy’s International said yesterday that it had reached a deal to give the billionaire investor Nelson Peltz access to the company’s books as he considers making an acquisition offer.Triarc, the restaurant company led by Mr. Peltz, and Wendy’s have been in negotiations for months about the rules governing the auction of the hamburger chain, No. 3 after McDonald’s and Burger King.Mr. Peltz has said that Triarc, parent company of the Arby’s fast-food chain, could offer up to $41 a share for Wendy’s.The parties entered into a confidentiality agreement Monday, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Triarc and Trian Fund Management, also controlled by Mr. Peltz, agreed to restrictions that limit their ability to buy Wendy’s shares as they review Wendy’s finances.Trian Fund Management has a 9.8 percent stake in Wendy’s, according to the filing.Wendy’s said in June that it would explore selling the company. A special committee of Wendy’s board is also weighing changes to the capital structure or revisions to the strategic plan.Last year, pressure from Mr. Peltz accelerated Wendy’s spin-off of its Tim Hortons coffee and doughnut chain and led to the sale of its struggling Baja Fresh unit.'"
"'07-08-29,'1','CEDAR RAPIDS, Iowa, Aug. 28 (AP) — Senator John McCain, the Arizona Republican whose presidential campaign is in dire financial straits, is eligible to receive public financing for his struggling bid, the Federal Election Commission said Tuesday.Mr. McCain requested authority to receive matching money on Aug. 10, but his campaign said he had not decided whether he would ultimately accept it. Doing so would put him at a major disadvantage against his well-financed rivals, Rudolph W. Giuliani and Mitt Romney, who are likely to forgo public financing and thus free themselves from spending limits.“We have not made a final decision,” said Jill Hazelbaker, a McCain spokeswoman, “but we are doing what’s necessary should we decide to opt into the matching fund system.”Mr. McCain is the first 2008 presidential candidate to be declared eligible to receive matching money. Should he take the cash, it would be a major strategic shift for a candidate who for months believed that he would not need public money.Mr. McCain, the former presumptive front-runner for the Republican nomination, set out to raise $100 million or more this year and drew up a budget based on that assumption. But the money did not come in as expected, and campaign spending was exorbitant. The campaign was all but broke by July.'"

He was 78.A spokeswoman for Luxembourg’s government news agency confirmed the death. No place or cause of death was immediately released.A longtime politician and businessman, Mr. Thorn led the government in the tiny Grand Duchy of Luxembourg from 1974 to 1979. He was known as a strong advocate of European integration.Gaston Egmond Thorn was born in the capital, Luxembourg city, on Sept. 3, 1928. He took part in the resistance against Nazi occupation during World War II and spent several months in prison for his opposition to Hitler’s invasion of his country. The war shaped his views promoting European unity as a way to prevent future conflict on the Continent.After the war, he studied law in France before entering politics in Luxembourg. He rose through the Liberal Democrat Party ranks and was appointed deputy mayor of Luxembourg city before entering the national Parliament.He was chairman of the Commission of the European Economic Community, the forerunner of the European Union, from 1981 to 1985, after which he returned to business.'"
"'07-08-29,'1','Home Depot agreed yesterday to sell its commercial supply business to an alliance of private equity firms for $8.5 billion, nearly $2 billion less than the original agreement.The sale was one of the first big buyouts to be renegotiated because of the recent tightening of credit and problems in the housing market.The company said it expected to earn about $7.9 billion from the transaction, which could close tomorrow.The refashioned deal cut the price, as expected, by roughly 18 percent, or $1.8 billion. Because the deal relies heavily on debt, investors and bankers have been watching closely for signs of how new limits on credit could affect other large buyouts, collectively worth nearly $400 billion, that are pending.Still, this deal is different in that the fortunes of Home Depot Supply, as the division is called, are tied closely to the housing market, which has also been weakening. After a series of negotiations to save the deal, Home Depot and the participating banks and buyout firms were all forced to put up more money to shore up the financing.'"
"'07-08-29,'1','SAN FRANCISCO, Aug. 28 (AP) — Electronic bidding began Tuesday for Barry Bonds’s 755th and 756th home run balls, with the price for the record-breaker starting at $100,000.Sotheby’s/SCP Auctions is handling sales of the balls Bonds hit to tie and break Hank Aaron’s career home run record. Bidding closes Sept. 15, when the winning offer will be announced.“These balls are some of the most historic baseballs to come up publicly for auction,” David Kohler, president of SCP Auctions, said.The Mission Viejo, Calif.-based auction house also handled the $102,000 sale of Bonds’s 700th home run ball, and the $220,000 sale of his 715th, which put him ahead of Babe Ruth on the home run list.Bonds broke Aaron’s record of 755 with a shot into the right-field seats on Aug. 7 against the Washington Nationals in San Francisco.

"'07-08-29,'1','The auction houses, unsurprisingly, present a more optimistic reading and say that art sales do not always follow economic cycles. “These kinds of assets don’t tend to react — in the past — on a week-to-week basis to market volatility,” said William F. Ruprecht, Sotheby’s chief executive. “If we go into a broad recessionary environment, undoubtedly that has an implication. But in the short to medium term, I believe there will be continued strong demand from all over the world for great works of art.”Although it is in their interest to be bullish, the auction executives can point to recent history to support their position. The 1987 stock market crash was followed by a two-year acceleration in the art market, Mr. Ruprecht noted, adding that a similar upswing came after the 1998 economic downturn.The Doyle New York auction house even achieved record sales after the crash of 1987. In 1989 a Chardin still life sold there for $2.5 million, then the highest auction price for an 18th-century painting, and a Rembrandt print fetched a record $990,000.“Over the last 20 years, the market has dropped a little and come roaring back,” said Elaine Banks Stainton, the executive director of Doyle’s paintings and drawings department.Michael Moses, who helped create the Mei/Moses Fine Art Index of prices, said the art market tended to follow the financial market by six months to a year. “We do have this historical phenomenon of the art market lagging behind the stock market,” he said. “It requires substantial change in wealth for a long period of time before people decide to change their investment decisions.”“When the big sales come along in November and December,” he added, “the stock markets might be doing something totally different. Art is a much slower-moving market only because it doesn’t trade that often.”While some buyers may drop out, auction house executives say, others will step in: the pool of potential buyers has increased as collectors grow more diverse.“The art market today feels as if it is substantially more global, with substantially broader groups of people — with different sources of wealth, with different perspectives on volatility,” Mr. Ruprecht said. “You’ve got entrepreneurial wealth, you’ve got Asian wealth, Russian wealth, Middle Eastern wealth, petroleum wealth, financial wealth — all, in many cases, competing for a common group of things.”The most competitive categories are contemporary, Modern, Impressionist, old masters and 19th-century paintings. But others areas, notably Asian art, are emerging.“For every downside, there are always opportunities on the other side,” said Kathleen M. Doyle, chairwoman of Doyle, which will hold its first sale of contemporary Chinese art in the fall.Marc Porter, the president of Christie’s, sees about 30 to 40 different markets, each with its own loyal or growing constituency. “Old masters, American paintings and Latin American paintings are not necessarily moving in the same direction,” he said. “It’s broadly cyclical and not directly tied to the stock or real estate market.”Because consignments for the November sales are still being negotiated — along with the guarantees that can promise a seller an undisclosed minimum, regardless of the auction’s outcome — it may be too soon to make comparisons with last year’s fall sales. But Sotheby’s reports that its consignments so far are running ahead of last year’s.One source of consignments — estates — largely remains constant, however. “People don’t necessarily die in sync with the financial market,” Ms. Doyle said.Aby Rosen, the Manhattan real estate developer and art collector, predicts that if buyers or prices do fall off, they will drop only slightly. Instead of buying two paintings at $500,000 each, he explained, a collector might buy 10 paintings at $10,000, or 5 at $20,000 each.“Rather than five people bidding for the same painting, it will be three people,” Mr. Rosen said. “Instead of making threefold on a sale, sellers will make two-and-a-half fold.”What many who make their living in the art market are counting on is that there will always be people who use art to telegraph their wealth, along with expensive cars, houses and jewelry.“The sense that buying art is important, vital, cool, accessible, sexy is not going away,” said Lucille Blair, an art consultant for collectors.But art has also become an asset with an intrinsic and lasting value. “It’s one of the only asset classes that’s not leveraged at all, so that a Warhol hanging in somebody’s house truly represents a million dollars in capital,” Mr. Porter of Christie’s said. “There may be years when it’s worth less, or years when it’s worth more. It’s real, it’s tangible and it doesn’t have a whiff of a derivative product about it.”Others concede that it is too early to make predictions. “Nobody really knows what’s going to happen in the financial markets,” said the developer Jerry I. Speyer, chairman of the Museum of Modern Art and himself a collector. “In my experience, people buy the best of whatever they can buy, if they can afford to buy.”'"
"'07-08-29,'1','Who wouldn’t want to live in Rome, one of the most beautiful cities in world?But even relatively wealthy people have thought twice about buying in the city in recent years as prices for luxury properties in the historic center now average 9,000 euros ($12,300) per square meter, or $1,143 per square foot, while a luxury home near the Spanish Steps can cost as much as 18,000 euros ($24,625) per square meter, or $2,289 per square foot.“It’s a wonderful place to live but prices have become overheated,” said Barbara Mutsaers, an American who has lived in and around Rome for 38 years with her husband Anthony Mutsaers.When the couple first came to Rome, they spent seven years living in the city and then almost 20 years in Frascati, one of the many castelli Romani, or ancient hilltop towns, southeast of Rome. But by 2002, they decided they wanted something less suburban.A chance detour brought them to a bucolic avenue dotted with old farmhouses, what the Italians call “rustici.” The houses sat on a ridge covered with vineyards just outside the town of Zagarolo, a town of more than 12,000 in the central Italian region of Lazio. “It was all agricultural land then and absolutely unknown to foreign buyers, though just 30 minutes to Rome by train,” said Mr. Mutsaers, who was working then as an economist at the United Nations’s offices in the city.The Mutsaers bought a 220-square-meter (2,370-square-foot) house with an acre of land and broad views over the Alban hills toward Rome. Then they set about renovating it in a modern American style. The house’s main level is an open-plan style, and there are three bedrooms and two and a half bathrooms.They also added a terrace to the rear of the house, where they both spend long hours soaking up the warm sunshine and looking out over their lush back yard, which stretches 200 meters (656 feet) down through vineyards to a kiwi plantation.'"

Hingis, the 1997 champion, defeated Mathilde Johansson, 6-0, 6-3, in a clean match: she had 23 winners and only 8 errors.Hewitt, seeded 16th and playing his first Grand Slam event with Tony Roche as his coach, won 19 of his 22 net approaches in his 6-2, 6-4, 6-2 victory over Amer Delic, an American ranked No. 71. Hewitt, who opened the play at Ashe Stadium, won here in 2001 and is trying to reach the Open quarterfinals for the eighth consecutive year. And while he is traveling with his wife and child, he is teleconferencing with Roche.Sania Mirza, seeded 26th, needed three sets to defeat Kaia Kanepi of Estonia, 6-2, 6-7 (5), 6-1, with the third set tougher than the score indicated.On a hazy day, other early winners included No. 11 Patty Schnyder and No. 13 Nicole Vaidisova, who won in straight sets.

"'07-08-29,'1','Confronting a new diagnosis can be frightening — and because research changes so often, confusing. Here are some questions you may not think to ask your doctor, along with notes on why they’re important.What type of depression do I have? Is it mild, moderate or severe?There are several forms of this mood disorder, including major depression, dysthymia, cyclothymia and seasonal affective disorder. Criteria for determining disease severity vary, depending on the specific diagnosis.Could my depression be caused by an underlying medical condition?Depression often arises in patients coping with cancer, heart disease, stroke, Parkinson’s disease and other long-term chronic illnesses. Management of the illness should be addressed in conjunction with treatment of the depression.Many patients rely on their family physicians for diagnosis and treatment, but several studies have found that the most effective treatment includes both medication and some form of talk therapy provided by a mental health professional.What if I don’t want to take a drug?Talk therapy alone can be effective in many cases, particularly in treating moderate depression, and exercise is clearly a mood elevator. St. John’s wort is a widely used alternative remedy; however, rigorous studies generally have failed to find it helpful in depression, and the herb interacts with a wide range of other drugs. Light therapy is effective in seasonal affective disorder.I am already taking other medications. Would an antidepressant be safe for me?Antidepressants interact with a variety of other drugs, though newer ones are less likely to do so. Patients should give their doctors a list of medications and supplements they are taking. Use of a single pharmacy can help reduce potential interactions.If medication needs to be prescribed, how soon will I feel better?Eight weeks at the full dose usually is adequate for an antidepressant to take effect. Oddly, mood may be the last symptom to improve. Many patients first experience improved energy and concentration, deeper sleep and improved appetite.How long do I need to take an antidepressant?Use of antidepressants usually is long term. To treat a first episode of depression, the medication is typically taken for one year; for a second episode, two years. Many chronically depressed patients never stop taking antidepressants.If the antidepressant is not working, what do I do?It is impossible for doctors to know which medication will be most effective for a particular patient in advance. Transitions from one drug to another are common and should be overseen by a doctor, as many patients suffer withdrawal symptoms.'"
"'07-08-29,'1','Depression is no monochromatic black veil, no shared melancholy, as is often claimed. Instead, the disorder is more like a virus that amplifies each sufferer’s particular vulnerabilities, whether anxiety, helplessness, self-doubt, anger or some combination of these. The subjective experience varies from person to person, yet treatment is far from personalized.Progress has slowed as researchers grapple with one of the most difficult aspects of the disorder: it is impossible to predict who will respond to what therapy, and many sufferers find no relief from anything now available, including medication. While depression appears in many forms, therapeutic options remain worryingly limited.“We’re at a point where we need to find new treatments, because it’s very clear that the old ones simply don’t work well for many people,” said Dr. Thomas Insel, director of the National Institute of Mental Health. “Our thinking about depression has to change, and it is changing.”Some people are genetically predisposed to react more strongly than others to life’s inevitable blows. Scientists have traced this susceptibility in part to how the body processes a neural messenger called serotonin, which is linked to mood, and helps cells learn and communicate. For the past 20 years, depression researchers have focused heavily on this connection, both to understand the disorder and find better treatments. A serotonin “deficit” or “imbalance” has become synonymous with depression itself in the public consciousness, an easy catch-all explanation reinforced in drug ads and awareness campaigns.But it is increasingly clear that serotonin is only one piece of the puzzle. Even when used aggressively by psychiatrists, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors like Prozac and Zoloft, which prolong the action of the neurotransmitter in the brain, speed recovery in only about half of seriously afflicted patients. In a small number of young people, these drugs seem to backfire, making patients more likely to harm themselves or to think about it.Indeed, many sufferers of moderate depression may be more likely to recover with talk therapy, particularly cognitive behavior therapy, in which patients learn techniques for defusing their own reflexive, self-defeating thoughts.Despite the clear need, better therapies for depression have been slow coming. Newer alternatives, like Effexor and Cymbalta, are not S.S.R.I.’s but so-called S.N.R.I.’s; they prolong the activity of a brain messenger called norepinephrine, as well as serotonin. But this extra effect does not seem to make much difference for most patients, and experts consider these drugs to be essentially an extension of S.S.R.I. therapy, not a real departure.“We really need to find better, more precise targets” for depression drugs, Dr. Insel said.Assaults on depression based primarily on serotonin have hit a wall, in effect, forcing psychiatrists and researchers to explore entirely new notions about the causes of the disorder and possible options for treatment.Recently investigators have explored the role of the hippocampus, an area deep in the brain critical to memory formation, in severe depression. They have looked more closely at the activity of the glutamate system, a brain messenger that jump-starts activity along neural networks. And they have used brain imaging to try to pinpoint areas in the brain that flare up or go quiet when people are suffering from spasms of despair.Brain imaging has already paid off in an unexpected way. In a series of brain-imaging experiments performed at the University of Toronto and at Emory University in Atlanta, Dr. Helen Mayberg, a neurologist, has found that activity in a part of the brain known as Brodman area 25 is strongly associated with the experience of despair.Brodman area 25 is uncharted territory; before these studies appeared, no one suspected it was linked to depression. But the researchers went one step further, implanting electrodes into the brains of severely and chronically depressed patients in an effort to quiet this area. The results were encouraging. Depression this severe can seem unbreakable, but most of the patients treated — more than a dozen have had the surgery — have improved enough that they have been able to return to work and to reconnect with family, friends and children. Most continue on drug therapy, as well.It is a radical experiment, but it has made the darkness of depression visible, a first for psychiatry. If there are many different permutations of depression, then imaging techniques like these should soon help doctors differentiate them. Dr. Mayberg’s work already suggests that depression looks different in the brains of people who respond to talk therapy, compared with those who do well on antidepressants.Scientists also are rethinking the pharmaceutical approach to depression, and in striking ways. Ketamine, a narcotic better known in nightclubs as “Special K,” has shown antidepressant effects in animal studies, but because of its reputation as a street drug it was never taken seriously as a potential therapy.But last year scientists at the National Institutes of Health reported in a small study that some severely depressed patients recovered within hours after taking the drug intravenously. Most of them remained in improved condition for more than a week. Now the N.I.H. is running a large-scale study to determine how long the therapeutic effect lasts, and in whom.The sudden scientific interest in ketamine has been criticized as a desperate stab at what has been an unsolvable medical puzzle, the treatment of chronic depression. But there is hope in the paradigm shift that has led to ketamine’s re-evaluation, and a welcome sign of change. The research already has scientists scrambling to find related compounds that don’t have the side effects of ketamine, as well as drugs that could sustain its effects once the initial treatment was stopped.After reporting results from the 2006 ketamine study, the lead author, Dr. Carlos Zarate, chief of the mood and anxiety disorders research unit of the National Institute of Mental Health, summed up the findings this way: “What the study tells us is that we can break the sound barrier.”He wasn’t just talking about breaking the hold of a devastating chronic disorder. He was talking about the science of depression itself, which was badly in need of a shake-up.'"

"'07-08-29,'1','Dr. Nancy A. Collop is an associate professor of medicine at Johns Hopkins University and a former president of the American Board of Sleep Medicine.Q: How long does it usually take a person with sleep apnea to seek medical treatment?A: Anecdotally, I think it's a year or two before a patient contacts his doctor. If you snore, suffer from daytime fatigue and have hypertension, it's certainly worth querying your family physician about the possibility of sleep apnea. Obesity is a risk factor, too, although sleep apnea can occur in people of ideal weight. As the person experiences more sleep deprivation, other symptoms become noticeable, such as weight gain.Q: Does obesity cause sleep apnea, or vice versa?A: If you gain weight or become obese, you're more likely to develop sleep apnea. Conversely, if you lose weight, you're more likely to get better.That said, there is some debate in the medical community over which comes first, the apnea or the obesity. One theory is that if you develop sleep apnea, it may change your metabolism or it may make you less active, leading to eventual weight gain. There is more to apnea than weight gain, but we can't answer that question fully until we have more of an understanding of the natural history of the disease.A: There's a very strong link between the two. Many of my patients are taking antidepressant medications. People with sleep apnea often complain of fatigue, lack of energy and poor sleep, all of which are hallmarks of depression. However, sleep researchers don't know if the depression is due to sleep deprivation, or if it's a specific manifestation of the sleep apnea itself. When the apnea is effectively treated, the depression often gets better.Q: How often does sleep apnea adversely affect marriages?A: I think it's very common that sleep apnea causes problems in a marriage. Any time I have new sleep apnea patients, I ask that they bring their partners with them. It's important that both of them understand what the disorder is and how to treat it. It is a big adjustment to see your partner strap on a continuous positive airway pressure, or C.P.A.P., mask every night.Some bed partners are very accepting of the C.P.A.P. machine, but others, men especially, often find it hard to get used to having a spouse use the device.Q: The gold standard therapy for treating sleep apnea for the past 25 years has been C.P.A.P. How effective is it?A: Think of air pressure from the device as a pneumatic splint that keeps the air passages open. In C.P.A.P. treatment, patients wear either a full mask that covers the nose and mouth, or a mask that covers only the nose. Tubes attach the mask to the C.P.A.P. machine.C.P.A.P. offers a dramatic improvement in sleep apnea symptoms. If a person tolerates the device, those with moderate to severe sleep apnea will notice a difference the first night. They will achieve maximum benefit after a couple of weeks of use.Research clearly shows that treatment with C.P.A.P. reduces cardiovascular risk, lowers the incidence of motor vehicle accidents and improves quality of life. C.P.A.P., unfortunately, is not curative.Q: How difficult is it to get patients to try C.P.A.P.?A: C.P.A.P. compliance ranges from as low as 50 percent of patients to as high as 80 percent. Many patients use the device for four hours a night, on average, every other night. The best predictor of compliance is how much the patient uses it in the first week or two. The other predictor is how educated a person is about sleep apnea and its health implications, and his level of understanding of how C.P.A.P. works.We can now monitor patient C.P.A.P. compliance through the computer chip in the machine, which gives doctors very accurate information about when the machine was started and stopped. This lets us know if the patient is following through with the therapy. Low compliance offers me a chance to give the patient a pep talk, explaining the health risks of sleep apnea, which can range from chronic daytime sleepiness and weight gain to heart disease, stroke and permanent memory loss.Q: Why do so many patients eventually stop using the device?A: Many people complain about having to strap a mask to their head every night. Patients often describe C.P.A.P. as having a ""tornado"" in their noses. The high flow of air created by the device, which is designed to keep the air passages open, can also lead to sinus congestion or runny nasal passages. Even though newer C.P.A.P. machines are equipped with humidifiers, congestion is still a major complaint and a reason why people give up.Others complain about irritation of the mask on the bridge of the nose or nostrils. Women often tell me that the headgear that holds the device in place can be bothersome and messes their hair. Some single people are embarrassed by the device and wonder what bed partner would want to sleep with someone wearing that sort of headgear. Occasionally, I'll have people say that the increased airflow causes them to swallow so much air that they wake up feeling bloated.Then there are the patients who just don't think sleep is that important, so they stop using C.P.A.P.Q: What is the next step for a patient who has tried C.P.A.P. and cannot tolerate it?'"
"'07-08-29,'1','Q: African-American men have a 60 percent higher incidence of prostate cancer than white men and are more than twice as likely to die of it. What accounts for those disparities?A: Many times, being black or African-American is really a surrogate indicator for access, a surrogate indicator for quality of care. But a Institute of Medicine report in 2003 indicated that after you corrected for all of those factors -- including socioeconomics, insurance and those kinds of things -- there still seems to be an element of racism that has something to do with differences in outcomes. It is a multifactorial kind of situation.Q: African-American men also have the highest incidence of major side effects from prostate cancer treatment. Why?A: That is another issue that I think has to be placed in the context of the types of places where African-American men are often treated for prostate cancer, and also of patients’ understanding of how to ask about all of the potential side effects and what can be done to mitigate some of them. A study just released from the American Society of Clinical Oncologists showed that if a patient’s first and only contact was with a urologist, he was more likely to have surgery. If his point of contact was a radiation oncologist, he was more likely to have radiation therapy.Certainly, people tend to follow the advice of the person that they see, and since most men are diagnosed with prostate cancer by their urologist, he or she is the first person that they have contact with. Whether or not men have actually been counseled by their urologist to see a radiation therapist would be the question, and it is certainly something that we should look to collect some data on.Q: Traditionally, one of the biggest challenges in prostate cancer has been simply getting men to come in for screening. Do you think that this is still the case?A: In a career that spans about 25 years, I have seen some change in the attitudes of men with regard to this. Some of that is a function of having, I think, a little bit more faith in and relationship with providers. And, of course, the whole explosion in the erectile dysfunction market also drove men into doctors’ offices, where we were able to begin to look at other things like cholesterol and heart disease, and to screen for prostate cancer. Not to mention that there’s been a lot of background noise now about prostate cancer, which has also helped men to understand this a bit better.Q: Have you seen evidence that the digital rectal exam itself has kept some men from being screened?A: Nobody, male or female, likes a rectal exam. The early screening that we used was a combination digital rectal exam and P.S.A. screening. And I’ve found that the compliance with having men coming in to be screened was far higher when we did a P.S.A.-only screening, which is obviously not as complete. We know that over 80 percent of the prostate cancers now are diagnosed in men with elevated P.S.A.’s, so we felt comfortable offering a P.S.A.-only screening, but with the provision that men understood that they still needed to have a digital rectal exam as well.Q: Studies show that African-American men with prostate cancer are the least likely to be satisfied with their doctor’s care. What might doctors do differently to gain their support?A: That finding doesn’t surprise me. If there are support groups that doctors can refer the person to, that’s great. If there are support groups where there are other African-American patients, that’s even better. If there are other African-American providers, that’s a plus as well. But the main thing is, whether African-American or not, to take time and be sensitive. In my own practice, when a man was diagnosed with prostate cancer, I did not rush in to start talking about therapy, because I thought many men needed time to process the idea that they had cancer, decide if they were going to share it with their families, and things of that nature. There needed to be psychological time.Q: How can men better explore their options for prostate cancer care?A: In our Us TOO support group here in Chicago — one of the largest predominantly African-American prostate cancer support groups in the Midwest, if not the country — it was clear that, listening to these men, many of them did not have an adequate opportunity to really look at what their options were. The options were pretty much those presented by the doctor that they were diagnosed by, and they were sometimes made to feel as though there was some urgency in making a decision. Our practice provided a packet of information, and we also created a videotape, “Not By Myself,” for those men who did not want to go to a support group — a videotape of men just talking about the psychological issues. Because people don’t realize that cancer is not just a physical diagnosis; it’s a psychological diagnosis. And it affects not only the patient, but the partner and family as well.Q: What role does a partner or spouse play in prostate care?'"

"'07-08-30,'0','As the Army’s suicide rate hits record levels in the Iraq war, there’s small wonder practically everyone in Congress wants to deal with the parallel emerging crisis of depressed veterans tempted to take their own lives. Everyone, that is, except Senator Tom Coburn, Republican of Oklahoma. He stands alone in blocking final passage of a suicide prevention bill in fear that the government’s record-keeping on troubled vets might somehow crimp their ability to purchase handguns.Even the craven gun lobby should manage some shame over this absurd example of Second Amendment idolatry.The House has unanimously approved a measure mandating the screening of all veterans for suicide risk, but Senator Coburn worries that veterans’ medical data might be appropriated by other agencies to deny that all-encompassing right to wield arms on the domestic front.The senator’s office points to another bill near passage — prompted by the Virginia Tech gun massacre — that would encourage states to do a better job of listing mentally troubled individuals on the federal roll of risky gun purchasers. But tying these two measures together is itself evidence of defective reasoning, or at least scurrilous politicking. The Virginia Tech measure has nothing to do with veterans and affects only those Americans formally judged by a court to be mentally disturbed.It is an eminently good thing that the anti-suicide measure would require medical specialists to keep track of veterans found to be high risks for suicide. But that’s to care for them as human beings, under that other constitutional right — to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. Respect for the grave sacrifices by veterans requires the Senate to strike down the Coburn ploy and hurry this vital measure to President Bush.'"

On the New York Stock Exchange, 1.3 billion shares changed hands, compared with a daily average of about 1.8 billion.“For as big as the movements we’ve seen the last two days, the volume has been pretty low,” said Ernie Ankrim, chief investment strategist at Russell Investments, an investing and financial research firm in Tacoma, Wash. “So I’m not sure I take too much stock in this. When you have small volumes you can have large movements dictated by relatively few market participants.”The Dow closed yesterday at 13,289.29. The S.& P. 500 rose 31.40 points, to 1,463.76, and the Nasdaq composite jumped 62.52 points, to 2.563.16.The benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell 14/32, to 101 16/32. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 4.56 percent, from 4.51 percent.Energy company stocks led the charge yesterday as oil prices jumped to a three-week high on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The price of a barrel of crude oil for delivery in October rose 2.5 percent, to $73.51, after the Energy Department reported that the nation’s gasoline and oil reserves fell more last week than Wall Street forecasters had predicted.After leading the market’s decline on Tuesday, shares of financial companies like Lehman Brothers and Citigroup rebounded yesterday as Wall Street saw a greater possibility that the Fed will lower its benchmark short-term lending rate by half a percentage point, to 4.75 percent, when it meets on Sept. 18. Futures contracts for the Fed’s key rate yesterday showed that nearly half of traders now expect a half-point rate reduction.The Fed has given no indication that a rate cut is imminent. But it has signaled that it is at least willing to consider one. Yesterday, the Fed again suggested that a rate cut was possible if conditions in financial markets deteriorated further.In a letter to Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, Mr. Bernanke wrote that the Fed’s policy making arm was “prepared to act as needed to mitigate the adverse effects on the economy arising from the disruptions in financial markets.”Mr. Schumer, chairman of the Joint Economic Committee, has been one of the loudest voices in Congress calling for the government to regulate mortgage lenders more closely. Mortgage companies have played a central role in the recent market tumult as banks have all but stopped buying asset-backed securities, fearing that the assets were bad subprime loans.Yesterday Mr. Schumer took aim at the nation’s largest mortgage lender, Countrywide Financial, saying the company should “bury its bad business practices and reverse some of the damage it has already inflicted on our housing market.”At issue was the allegation, which Countrywide has disputed, that the lender improperly steered customers to high-cost mortgages that resulted in richer commissions for Countrywide’s sales representatives and large fees to company affiliates providing services on the loans.Yesterday’s rally on Wall Street was helped in part by the absence of any big developments in the financial world. Recently, news that major investment banks have lost billions of dollars because of their exposure to bad subprime loans has sent Wall Street reeling.“When you don’t have any news, that’s good news,” said Todd Leone, head of trading at Cowen & Company, a New York brokerage firm.But how much the financial market turmoil has affected the economy is still not known. And investment strategists cautioned that the extent of the damage would not begin to be fully revealed until next month when economic indicators, like the government’s employment report, are released.“The maximum risk time is going to be the next 60 days when the major economic reports come out and they have some post-crisis data in them,” said James W.

Sightings in recent night sessions included Martha Stewart, Janet Jackson and Star Jones.Aravane Rezaï’s interest in stars is more literal. Rezaï, a 20-year-old Frenchwoman, has more curiosity about Venus, the planet, than Venus, the player.“When I was a child, I watched the stars every night,” Rezaï said after losing to fifth-seeded Ana Ivanovic, 6-3, 6-1. “For me it’s very interesting to learn more about the stars and different galaxies. I have so many books on the stars. When I finish one, I go out and buy another one.”Rezaï said she planned to study astrophysics when she was done playing tennis. Her short-term goals are twofold. To become a star in tennis and “buy a telescope so I can see the stars better,” she said.USING YOUR HEAD Ana Ivanovic, who has won two singles titles this year, in Berlin and in Los Angeles, can tell her star is rising. Leaving the practice courts Tuesday, she was besieged by autograph seekers, including a male admirer who asked her to sign his forehead.“I was like, ‘Are you kidding?’ ” Ivanovic, a Serb, said, laughing. She declined, but in a nice way. “I felt bad,” she said.“I say, ‘I can sign your ball or shirt, but forehead?’ ”It turns out that is not the strangest request she has received. Earlier this year Ivanovic, who advanced to the final of the French Open and the semifinals at Wimbledon, was asked by a fan to sign his underwear.HENMAN TO PACK IT IN The Englishman Tim Henman, who announced he was retiring at the end of this year, advanced to the third round with a 6-4, 3-6, 6-3, 6-4 victory against Dmitry Tursunov of Russia.

I’m a simple kind of girl, pretty casual, pretty laid-back.”NAME TO REMEMBER As the volatile Marat Safin of Russia was trying to compose himself against his unseeded opponent, Frank Dancevic of Canada, the Armstrong Stadium fans had a little fun rooting for the underdog.They chanted “Go, Frank!” and “Fight, Frank, Fight!” in hopes of extending the match past three sets.You do not often hear raucous chants of “Go, Frank!” at a tennis match. Have there been many famous Franks in the sport?“Frankly speaking, yes,” said the authority, Bud Collins, who rattled off a few.Perhaps, the most important Frank, however, was Frank Hadow, the inventor of the lob shot.According to Collins, Hadow (called P. Frank) invented the shot at the 1878 Wimbledon final when he beat Spencer W. Gore in three sets.This Frank — Frank Russell Dancevic — was born in Niagara Falls, Canada. His parents are from Belgrade. Ranked No. 69 in the world, he made it to the finals at Indianapolis this summer and entered the main Open draw as a qualifier. For one day, at least, he made a name for himself. LIZ ROBBINS'"

"'07-08-30,'0','Children ages 5 to 11 with asthma require different treatment than do adults, guidelines issued yesterday by the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute say.The new guidelines are the first to recognize that this age group has distinct needs and should not be lumped together with adults, as has been done in the past.Specifically, these children can often control their asthma with inhalers that contain only steroid drugs, whereas adults are more likely to need inhalers that combine steroids and other medicines.The new information is part of a 440-page report (http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/guidelines/asthma/asthgdln.htm) that spells out details for diagnosing and treating the disease. The report emphasizes that every patient should have a treatment plan that considers not only current symptoms, but also the risk of future attacks. Someone with asthma can be feeling perfectly fine and yet still be at high risk of having a severe attack.

The figures were released ahead of the International Day of the Disappeared on Thursday.“For years now, ever since the conflict in the former Yugoslavia broke out, the I.C.R.C. has strived to support the plea of the families of missing persons, hoping to bring about more answers on the fate of their beloved,” said Paul Henri Arni, the head of the Red Cross in Belgrade.Some estimates say 200,000 people were killed and 2.2 million displaced in Bosnia’s 1992-95 conflict, but an independent study issued in June put the number of dead at fewer than 100,000. More than 20,000 are believed to have been killed in Croatia’s 1991-95 war, and up to 10,000 in Kosovo in 1998 and 1999.'"
"'07-08-30,'0','REYES’S AVERAGE BELOW .300 José Reyes says he loves hitting at Citizens Bank Park more than at any other ballpark he visits, and the statistics back him up. He entered Wednesday’s game as a career .339 hitter there with seven home runs.But in the first two games of this series against the Phillies, Reyes was held off the basepaths in his nine plate appearances and his season average dropped below .300, to .297, for only the second time since April 4.“I’ve just had two bad games,” Reyes said. “I can’t be successful all the time.”In the coming weeks, Willie Randolph will try to find a day off for Reyes, who has played the fourth-most innings in the majors and has started 131 of 132 games. But it will not come soon.“When you’re playing the Phillies and Braves, no one’s looking for off days,” Randolph said.Reyes added, “I’m never going to go into Willie’s office and say that I can’t play.”Reyes said he was still thinking about a pivotal play in Tuesday’s 4-2 loss. With the speedy Shane Victorino representing the tying run on first base with two outs in the eighth, Reyes was playing Aaron Rowand to pull the ball.When Victorino broke to steal second, it was impossible, Reyes said, to run behind Luis Castillo to back up the throw in time. The ball bounced past Castillo and into center field, allowing Victorino to advance to third and eventually score on Rowand’s swinging-bunt single.“He’s fast,” Randolph said of Reyes, “but I don’t think he’s that fast.”PELFREY MAY START SATURDAY Although the Mets would not announce it, all signs point to Mike Pelfrey starting Saturday’s game in Atlanta. Pelfrey was pulled after throwing 43 pitches in two and two-thirds innings for Class AAA New Orleans on Tuesday.His major league experience, though not the results, should give him the edge over his Zephyrs teammate Philip Humber. In discussing Pelfrey, who is 0-7 with a 5.92 earned run average in 10 appearances (9 starts) for the Mets, Omar Minaya mentioned how Pelfrey’s lack of success should be viewed within the context of run support.According to Stats, L.L.C., among pitchers who have made at least nine starts this season, Pelfrey on average has received the worst run support in the league, 2.59 runs a game.But Pelfrey has not helped himself much, with batters hitting .298 off him and .344 with runners in scoring position.Even if Humber does not start Saturday, the Mets have apparently changed their minds on whether to promote him as part of their September call-ups.Last week, Willie Randolph said he could not foresee Humber joining the team because he did not want to use Humber out of the bullpen and there would not be space for a spot start. What changed?“A one-hitter and another good outing helped,” Minaya said.On Aug. 22, Humber lost a no-hitter with one out in the ninth. On Monday, Humber allowed two hits in five scoreless innings before leaving after he was hit in the shoulder by a batted ball. Minaya said that the X-Rays came back negative and that Humber was scheduled to throw a bullpen session Wednesday or Thursday.BELTRáN SAYS HE’S FINE Carlos Beltrán said his right rib cage, which was X-rayed (negative) after he was hit by an Adam Eaton pitch Tuesday, felt fine. He was in the starting lineup Wednesday. Sandy Alomar Jr. cleared waivers and was outrighted to Class AA Binghamton in preparation for his promotion when rosters expand Saturday.Philadelphia second baseman Chase Utley did not start Wednesday but is expected to rejoin the lineup Thursday.The quote of the day came from Paul Lo Duca, who played one game for the possibly playoff-bound Class A Cyclones, to Omar Minaya. “If Brooklyn wins, do I get a ring?”'"

Ms. Simmons, 44, joined Gap in 2001 as vice president and treasurer.The retailer, which operates Gap, Old Navy and Banana Republic stores, has been struggling with weak sales and has been trying to make a turnaround, shedding executives and cutting costs.On Friday, the company reported that second-quarter net income rose 19 percent to meet analysts’ expectations, helped by aggressive cost cutting and reorganization. But revenue fell 1 percent, and same-store sales, a key gauge of retailer health, fell 5 percent.Gap shares fell 28 cents, to $18.39, in after-hours trading, after closing up 60 cents at $18.67.'"
"'07-08-30,'0','PANAMA, Aug. 29 (Reuters) — The governing party has nominated a lawmaker who was indicted for the drive-by killing of an American soldier in the 1990s as its candidate to head Congress, in a vote likely to upset Washington.The Revolutionary Democratic Party backed the lawmaker, Pedro Miguel González, on Tuesday night, making him almost certain to win the post in a vote Saturday.Mr. González, 42, was indicted in the United States on charges that he shot dead Sgt. Zak A. Hernandez of the Army in June 1992, a day before a visit by President George Bush. At a tense time after the 1989 American invasion and capture of the Panamanian leader, Manuel Antonio Noriega, The sergeant was killed when the Humvee he was driving was ambushed north of Panama City.Mr. González said he was at a demonstration to protest the Bush visit at the time of the shooting, and he was acquitted at a 1997 trial in Panama. Washington says the trial was marred by jury rigging, witness intimidation and government harassment.'"
"'07-08-30,'0','But even some of the top-ranked players, who usually get the most time under the lights, needed to get used to the environment.“A few years ago, I did hate to play night sessions,” said Justine Henin, the No. 1 seed in this year’s women’s draw. “That was something I was really scared about, playing in the night, because of my contacts, because you’re a little bit more tired. It’s later in the day. You have to wait the whole day.”Henin said she got used to the night matches after playing them so often, and now she uses the same word that many other players employ to describe the atmosphere: electric.“Somehow you always have the feeling you’re playing better at night than during the day,” Roger Federer, the men’s No. 1 seed, said.With night tennis, though, comes a drastic change in a player’s schedule. Having a match run past midnight affects the way players sleep, exercise, practice and, most important for some, eat.Doug Spreen, the athletic trainer for Andy Roddick and the United States Davis Cup team, said one of the first conversations players had after a match was about where to find food.“At 1 in the morning, everybody knows where you go for a late-night meal after you’ve been out at night,” Spreen said. “Where do you end up? You end up at a greasy spoon somewhere. And that’s not exactly the best thing for tennis players.”With rain delays and five-set matches, tennis can often be an all-night affair for players. Spreen, who worked as a trainer with the ATP, said he recalled a time when Todd Martin had to receive fluids intravenously after a night match.“I remember pulling back into my hotel at 4:30, 5 in the morning,” Spreen said. “At that point, for him, now he’s almost at breakfast. I remember, for him, he was useless the next day.”Multiple tennis sessions also mean round-the-clock work for those involved in setting up and organizing the Open. Danny Zausner, managing director of the tennis center, said the U.S.T.A. had people working at the facility 24 hours a day, beginning about 30 days before the Open.The tennis association also has transportation meetings starting in April, while it works to push mass transit and encourage Major League Baseball to schedule away games for the Mets.The tennis center has at least 8,000 accessible parking spots, as well as the Long Island Rail Road and the subway nearby, but as matches run later, transportation options become more limited. Zausner said the U.S.T.A. had also explored the idea of a ferry system.“I think what happens is people know their schedules,” Zausner said. “The truth is, regardless of what the match is, you’re going to see people who live by their schedules. They want to be home by a certain time, regardless of who’s playing.”One worry with late tennis could also be that children around the country shut off their televisions early, leaving a younger generation unable to watch the best matches. But Kantarian said that had not been an issue, because so much of the Open was played during the day.John McEnroe, a four-time United States Open champion and a television analyst, said he thought the tournament may be worrying too much about ratings.“I think we’re getting sucked up into that a little too much,” McEnroe said in a telephone interview, adding that he would like to see the latest matches begin a little earlier.But McEnroe also said he would prefer to play at 9 p.m. rather than 11 a.m. Since the women’s final began taking a prime-time slot on network television in 2001, it seems male and female players have needed to be comfortable with Open night tennis — and all of its unique traits — to win this Grand Slam event.“Part of winning the U.S. Open is battling the elements that come with night tennis,” Kantarian said. “We think that’s what separates this event from other tennis events and other sporting events.”'"
"'07-08-30,'0','According to The Fort Worth Star-Telegram, only 88 of the 237 out-of-conference games played by teams in the six major conferences will be against teams from the five other top leagues. Coaches and athletic directors predict that number will decrease, especially since teams can use one victory a season against a Division I-AA team toward the six victories needed for bowl eligibility.“There’s less incentive to play them nowadays because strength of schedule is less and less of a factor than it used to be,” Oklahoma Coach Bob Stoops said of marquee out-of-conference matchups. “You’re better off if you schedule lighter because you have more of an opportunity to be undefeated. You take less chances.”That puts a premium on games like Cal versus Tennessee, especially in this era of the B.C.S. title game, when teams from different conferences are constantly compared to one another despite fewer matchups to use as samples.“It was the ninth game of the season, and we’d just won eight games straight, and people were still talking about the Tennessee game,” Tedford said. “It’s high risk, high reward. If you’re not successful, then you’re carrying that with you for a long time like last year.”Thanks to off-season comments by Louisiana State Coach Les Miles, Cal’s game with Tennessee will also take on a measure of conference pride. In a radio interview over the summer, Miles mocked U.S.C.’s path to the national title game, referring mockingly to Cal and other Pac-10 teams as “some real juggernauts.”Hansen took a subtle shot at programs that play all of their out-of-conference games at home and do not play return games. He is confident in the way his league’s teams have scheduled, especially considering that U.S.C. travels to Nebraska, Cal plays Tennessee, Oregon travels to Michigan, Washington is host to Boise State and Ohio State, and U.C.L.A. plays Notre Dame.“We’re competing for a B.C.S. berth with conferences where they do have eight home games, and seem to have brought in opponents they’re very confident that they can defeat,” Hansen said. “We’re playing the toughest teams we can find to play, and some of the others obviously have not.”Take a team like Kansas. The Jayhawks open the season with home games against Central Michigan, Southeast Louisiana, Toledo and Florida International. They will be favorites in all those games, and if they win them, they will only have to scrape two more wins out of their schedule to qualify for a bowl game.That is a scheduling philosophy that Kansas State Coach Bill Snyder popularized in the 1990s, when he built an irrelevant program into a national title contender.“I’ll be honest with you, I think playing Nebraska and Oklahoma and Texas, that’s plenty of competition, don’t you think?” Mangino said. “There will be a time when it’s appropriate for us to play those kind of games. Now, we’re just not ready for it.”The Big East’s perception could suffer this season because of its teams’ weak out-of-conference schedules. Last season, the Big East solidified its revival when its teams went 11-7 against teams from other B.C.S. conferences.This season, however, the league lacks a true marquee out-of-conference game. Louisville Athletic Director Tom Jurich, for example, said that the Cardinals were not able to schedule a high-caliber opponent. Other programs that were rebuilding shied away from high-wattage games.The best intraconference games involving Big East teams are South Florida at Auburn on Sept. 8, West Virginia at Maryland on Sept. 13, Louisville at Kentucky on Sept. 15 and Maryland at Rutgers on Sept. 29. Nick Carparelli Jr., the league’s associate commissioner, said that for the 2008 season, the Big East’s teams upgraded their out-of-conference schedules to include Notre Dame (twice), Auburn, Colorado, Penn State, Iowa, Virginia and Oklahoma. He acknowledges that the league’s reputation will take some shots this season.“I think we may be a target this year,” Carparelli said. “We hope people are mindful of where we were and how far we’ve come.”And that is what makes the inevitable comparisons of teams from different conferences tricky these days. With games like Cal against Tennessee becoming increasingly rare, it is difficult to judge the caliber of leagues when their teams shy away from playing each other.'"
"'07-08-30,'0','Basis Capital Fund Management, an Australian firm that has said losses in its Basis Yield Alpha hedge fund could exceed 80 percent, filed for bankruptcy protection yesterday for the fund, citing defaults in subprime mortgages in the United States.Basis, which is based in Sydney, asked a court in the Cayman Islands late Tuesday for permission to liquidate its assets, according to a petition filed yesterday in New York. The fund, which is registered in the islands, has assets and liabilities of more than $100 million, according to yesterday’s petition, which asked a federal bankruptcy judge to bar lawsuits in the United States while it liquidates in the Caymans.Basis Capital, founded in 1999, had more than $1 billion in assets as recently as May. It lost money as defaults in home loans to the riskiest borrowers spread to the broader credit markets. Basis followed Bear Stearns, which is seeking bankruptcy protection for two of its funds in the Caymans.A federal judge refused this month to grant permanent protection from American lawsuits to the two Bear Stearns funds registered in the Caymans. The judge said he needed more time to determine whether the Caymans was the proper jurisdiction for the liquidation, since most fund assets were in New York.Most of the Basis Yield Alpha Fund’s creditors and assets appear to be based in America, said Kurt Mayr, a lawyer in the financial restructuring group at Bracewell & Giuliani.Creditors of Basis include JP Morgan Chase, Goldman Sachs International, Citigroup Global Markets, Morgan Stanley, Lehman Brothers International (Europe) and Merrill Lynch International, according to court documents. Those creditors issued default notices to Basis Yield after its devaluations in June.Basis Yield Alpha has fewer than 49 creditors, according to the petition, which was filed under Chapter 15 of the federal bankruptcy law. Under Chapter 15, a company based abroad can win protection from United States creditors while it liquidates or reorganizes overseas.'"
"'07-08-30,'0','Eric Nicoli stepped down as chief executive of the EMI Group yesterday ahead of private investors’ purchase of the music corporation, which had tried unsuccessfully throughout his eight-year tenure to merge with rivals.Mr. Nicoli’s exit came as Terra Firma Capital Partners, the European private equity firm that paid £2.4 billion ($4.8 billion) for EMI, named executives from its own ranks to management positions and board seats. EMI’s chief financial officer, Martin Stewart, will also depart in advance of the company’s removal from the London Stock Exchange, expected in mid-September.Terra Firma, a five-year-old firm led by the financier Guy Hands, also said EMI would report to a new supervisory board that would be overseen by Mr. Hands and another Terra Firma executive, Julie Williamson.Under Mr. Nicoli, 57, EMI tried several times to merge with rival music companies, most prominently Warner Music Group. Each time, the efforts stumbled on regulatory concerns, management disputes or other hurdles.In recent years, EMI also struggled financially, posting a string of profit warnings and lagging behind in the United States, the world’s biggest music market. After a management shake-up earlier this year, Mr. Nicoli rattled the industry by pushing ahead with a plan to sell digital downloads of music unfettered by copy restriction software — a departure from the big labels’ conventional wisdom on fighting piracy.Mr. Nicoli said in a letter to employees yesterday that he would remain an adviser to EMI to assist in the transition to new ownership. Mr. Nicoli is expected to depart with compensation valued at about $6 million, according to a person briefed on EMI’s affairs.'"
"'07-08-30,'0','Difficulties like decreased libido are not the only problems stemming from adults remaining sexually active later in life (“Many Found Sexually Active Into the 70s,” news article, Aug. 23).As we reported in last year’s landmark Research on Older Adults With H.I.V. study, the fastest-growing segment of the H.I.V.-positive population consists of people over 50 years old.In New York City, 33 percent of the nearly 100,000 people with the disease are 50 and older. The success of antiviral drugs makes it likely that this group will account for the majority of people with the disease in the next decade.The study also found that heterosexual sex is the primary mode of H.I.V. transmission, with 61 percent of those over 50 who were infected in the last five years citing this form of contracting the disease.One probable reason is that condoms may be viewed as unnecessary once menopause has removed the danger of unwanted pregnancy. Since few H.I.V.-prevention resources are aimed at older adults, new infection rates could grow.Unfortunately, the aging H.I.V.-AIDS population faces a health care system and social-support network ill prepared to meet its needs. New York was the first American city to begin an H.I.V.-prevention program for older adults. It is vital that officials, policy makers and others initiate similar efforts.'"
"'07-08-30,'0','With this year’s news about the ways some unscrupulous colleges make an extra buck off students’ naïveté — from loan officers who accepted lenders’ kickbacks to schools that got cash incentives to steer students to expensive study-abroad programs — I felt it was expedient to warn my daughter about a big expense that looms before her.“Can’t I just buy them at the campus bookstore?” she asked.I shuddered. As much as I hate to micromanage, I felt compelled to remind her that taking that approach can cost the average college student $700 to $1,000 a year for books, according to a Congressional advisory committee report released in May.“Which is why,” I concluded, as I organized her T-shirts by color and neckline, “you should get cheaper books online.”“Fine,” she said. “From which store?”Good question. Although oodles of online stores and marketplaces — like Biblio.com, Abebooks.com and A1books.com — have in the past five years built large inventories of both used and discounted new textbooks, there’s no single site where you can always get the best deal.That’s only one of the reasons that, until now, buying textbooks online hasn’t been nearly as convenient as walking into a bookstore, where students didn’t need to calculate the shipping costs, wonder how soon a book would arrive or worry whether they would end up with an outdated edition.Which explains why most students still end up shopping on campus, said Dave Rosenfeld, a spokesman for Maketextbooksaffordable.org, a site operated by a coalition of student public interest research groups.“A really savvy student might do the extra work to comparison shop or to call a professor to see if it’s O.K. to use an older edition, but that will be uncommon behavior in the marketplace,” Mr. Rosenfeld said in a phone interview.“What about a person who stashes dirty dishes under a bed to avoid walking to the kitchen?” I asked.“Even the savviest students are going to pay a lot of money for books,” he said tactfully.The good news is that there’s a new tool this year to make it easier to shop online for textbooks.Bookfinder.com, an umbrella search site that sifts through the inventories of hundreds of thousands booksellers worldwide, started a simple, easy-to-use textbook search tool. The way it works: enter a title, I.S.B.N. or author’s name in Bookfinder’s textbooks search box to navigate a huge database of 125 million new and used books. You can compare prices, shipping costs and the availability of less expensive editions published overseas.Consider, for example, a textbook required for an advanced Japanese course at my daughter’s college. A Bookfinder search last week for “Genki II: An Integrated Course in Elementary Japanese II” turned up 24 new and used copies, at prices ranging from $20.94 at Amazon.com to $110.62 at Amazon.de. For each of the 24 copies, total price (including shipping) is listed on a single page, along with information about how soon the book will ship. Some sellers offer expedited delivery. Amazon, for instance, offers overnight delivery and discounts of up to 30 percent off on new copies of 200,000 textbooks.“Our goal is to give students all the options of buying any new or used edition, whether it’s published here or for an overseas market, and then let them decide which books are the best deals for them,” said Anirvan Chatterjee, Bookfinder.com’s founder.There are some caveats. My daughter, like a lot of freshmen, won’t know which textbooks she needs to buy until she completes registration on the eve of starting classes; some books she may need immediately. And some instructors may require the newest American editions of textbooks.“But in most cases, most international editions published for Canada, the Philippines, Malaysia and India are really similar to the U.S. versions,” Mr. Chatterjee said. “So we’ve been working on really boosting our inventory of those books, adding 18 to 20 new international partners this year.”Here are some practical tips for shopping online for textbooks this year:THE BIGGEST SAVINGS are on the most expensive books. For freshmen who are already overwhelmed trying to find classroom buildings or negotiate a truce with a new roommate, shop around for one or two of the priciest textbooks you need. A new copy of a first-year textbook like, say, “Biology, seventh edition” by Neil Campbell and Jane Reece, which lists for $153.33, was available for $57.45 last week at Valorebooks.com.SEARCH ONLINE for textbooks with nonspecific names like “Chemistry” or “Calculus,” using the International Standard Book Number (or I.S.B.N.) to make sure you buy the right book.GET AN EARLY START. With students nationwide competing to get the best deals, shop as soon as possible. More and more schools — from big public universities like the University of California, Berkeley, to private schools like Lynchburg College — list required textbooks on their Web sites. The State University of New York at Binghamton’s site, for instance, lists required texts by course and individual instructor.“Not that I want to interfere,” I told my daughter.“Of course not,” she said.I opened the bottom drawer of her dresser. There I found my favorite black cardigan, missing for months.“Don’t worry, I can take care of myself,” she said, grabbing the sweater and packing it.Maybe she can. I noticed my favorite belt (“missing” since April) was in already in her suitcase.'"
"'07-08-30,'0','Clearly, three things are happening. One, I am losing my mind. Two, tennis is not the phenomenon in the United States that it was a decade or two ago. And three, other parts of the world are producing superior players at a faster per capita rate than the United States.Maybe I am the last to realize that Serbia, with no strong centralized tennis program like the old Czechoslovakia had, has managed to put three players in the top five seeds of the current Open. Ana Ivanovic, seeded fifth, beat Aravane Rezaï of France, 6-3, 6-1, yesterday, and Jelena Jankovic, seeded third, defeated Olga Govortsova of Belarus, 6-2, 6-2. Djokovic, seeded third, will play Radek Stepanek of the Czech Republic in the second round, probably tomorrow. A fourth Serb in the Open, Janko Tipsarevic, defeated Ryan Sweeting of the United States, 5-7, 6-2, 6-4, 6-2, yesterday.This wave of Serbian tennis power was celebrated in Belgrade in June, after all three young stars had done well in the French Open. Djokovic, Ivanovic and Jankovic, making a rare cameo appearance in their homeland, waved to a huge crowd in the square outside the parliament building.“When I was a kid, I went there to welcome volleyball and basketball players,” Ivanovic recalled yesterday, adding that this time “it was me standing up on a terrace.”The three Serbs reached the top 10 in different ways. Ivanovic, not yet 20, learned to play in Serbia during the most violent years of the breakup of the old Yugoslavia, whereas Jankovic, 22, moved to Bradenton, Fla., for her education. Djokovic also moved west, to Munich, to study under Nikki Pilic.“I can say it was difficult to practice and develop into the professional tennis player coming from the country which never had such a big tennis tradition,” Djokovic said Tuesday. “So I had to leave in the early ages to somewhere else.”All three Serbs speak English well, react like adults, make eye contact and generally show no signs of that common tour disease, tennis elbow of the personality.At a wiry 6-foot-2 and 177 pounds, with a supple, all-around game, Djokovic has been a revelation, racing past some of the older mainstays. He retains a touch of the inner class clown, doing pretty good imitations of his colleagues, without ticking them off. (In the YouTube era, everybody under a certain age is a performer.)On Tuesday, Djokovic also demonstrated sportsmanship, clapping on his racket after a fine passing shot by Robin Haase of the Netherlands.Djokovic is still coming to grips with what he accomplished in Montreal. A large crowd filed into Ashe Stadium for the opening match Tuesday morning, at a time when that gigantic place is normally still yawning.“I’m No. 3 of the world, so people come to see,” Djokovic said. “I’m still young, you know. I made a big breakthrough this year, so everybody’s really interested the way I play. It was the first match.“It was a fantastic atmosphere,” he added. “A lot of crowd was behind me. I had a great support from my countrymen and from Americans, which is very important for the future, for the next matches, upcoming matches.”There figure to be more matches in main stadiums for the three Serbs, whom I now have fixed in my mind. Now it’s on to the 8 Russian men and 18 Russian women in this tournament — before the cast changes drastically all over again next year.'"

"'07-08-31,'1','The dispute between Apple and NBC Universal over the pricing of video on iTunes grew more heated today as Apple announced it would not add any new NBC television shows to the online store’s inventory.Among the fall shows NBC Universal will not be able to market through iTunes, effective immediately, are “Bionic Woman,” a high-profile and expensive modernization of the 1976 original, and “Chuck,” a drama about a computer geek whose brain is sought by nefarious government groups. New episodes of returning shows, including popular ones like “The Office” and “Heroes,” are not affected.Private negotiations between the companies over pricing became public Thursday when NBC Universal told Apple it would not renew its iTunes contract, which expires in December. Among other things, the media company is unhappy that Apple will not relax its policy of pricing downloads of television shows at a flat $1.99. NBC Universal wants to be able to charge more for popular episodes or, in the case of special promotions, to charge less.Today, Apple swatted back, characterizing NBC Universal’s move as a greedy attack on consumer interests. Apple said the sharp wholesale price increases NBC Universal is seeking for certain content would drive retail prices to $4.99 per episode.“We are disappointed to see NBC leave iTunes because we would not agree to their dramatic price increase,” said Eddy Cue, vice president of iTunes, in a statement. “We hope they will change their minds and offer their TV shows to the tens of millions of iTunes customers.”The move by Apple pokes NBC Universal in a soft spot. NBC, mired in fourth place among the big broadcast networks, urgently needs one of its new fall series to turn into a hit. The iTunes service is so popular that it has become an important place for media companies to market new albums, television shows and movies.NBC Universal content currently accounts for over 30 percent of television show sales on iTunes. In addition to NBC shows, the company provides content from its Bravo, Sci-Fi and USA cable channels and the Telemundo Spanish-language network.'"
"'07-08-31,'1','With about three minutes to play, Kolb threw a perfect pass to Zac Collie running a post pattern for a 31-yard touchdown. Coach Andy Reid had the Eagles go for 2 points, and Kolb made the decision pay off, rolling to his right and connecting on a pass to Nate Ilaoa for the conversion.Kolb moved up the depth chart after the game when Reid announced that the Eagles’ No. 2 quarterback, A. J. Feeley, broke his left (nonthrowing) hand in the first quarter. Feeley is scheduled to see a hand specialist Friday; it is not known how long he will be out.After he wades through the videotapes, Jets Coach Eric Mangini will have tough decisions to make as he reduces the team’s roster to 53 players from 75 by Saturday.“I’m happy with the way we were able to complete the two-minute drive,” Mangini said. “That’s the nice thing about the preseason. There are so many situations that come up that you can learn from.”Tuiasosopo’s teammates sometimes made it difficult for him to make a strong impression. His first pass was dropped. On his next pass attempt, he was sacked. It remained to be seen if Mangini would keep Tuiasosopo on the 53-man roster, or elect to go with only three quarterbacks.“All I can do is go out there and play well,” Tuiasosopo said. “I hope I showed that I learn from mistakes, don’t make the same mistake twice. Hopefully, I’ve shown I’m a guy who can help this team win in whatever role I’m asked.”Each starting quarterback sat out the game — Chad Pennington of the Jets and McNabb of the Eagles. Kellen Clemens, who has solidified his position as the Jets’ No. 2 quarterback during the preseason, started and played the entire first quarter, completing his two passes for 12 yards.Brad Smith (2 of 8 for 29 yards) struggled after relieving Clemens in the second quarter. He was often flushed out of the pocket, and in the second quarter he lost a fumble after being hit by Eagles defensive end Marques Murrell. The biggest culprit on that play was Jets left tackle Adrian Jones, who was beaten badly on Murrell’s pass rush.Most of the Jets’ standout performers were on defense or special teams. Nose tackle C. J. Mosley had a huge first quarter, with three sacks and a forced fumble on the same series. Mosley is fighting for a roster spot with the Jets, but if he does not stick, his performance should draw another team’s attention. The rookie Chansi Stuckey also drew notice for his 38-yard punt return.Mangini will surely be upset with tight end Sean Ryan, who drew a 15-yard penalty for taunting in the second quarter after the Jets had reached Philadelphia’s 14. That penalty killed the drive’s momentum, as penalties in the red zone often do.The Eagles had a 25-yard touchdown pass from Kolb to Collie nullified in the second quarter, when Michael Gasperson was called for pass interference. Whenever either team’s offense threatened to reach the end zone during the first half, something was bound to go wrong.'"

"'07-08-31,'1','The elder Elway said he did not want his return to the football field to turn into a news media frenzy and wants to keep the focus on the players.John Elway had not been on the football field in a long time. He retired in 1999, when most of the players he is coaching were in the third grade. But with Jack in his senior season, John’s urge kicked in.“He was kind of was like, What would you think if I came and coached?” Jack said. “I just said that’d be great. If anything, he can help us out. It wasn’t a big shock for me to see him out here, and everyone kind of got used to it.”Jack, named for his grandfather, started as a junior. He is considering a number of major-college programs, but he said his dad was not pushing for him to go to Stanford like he did.“I liked Stanford,” Jack said. “My sister goes there, so I’ve been there a bit. But I’d say Oregon, Arizona State, L.S.U., and U.C.L.A.”Critchett said one would never know the Elways were related by the way they interact on the field.“I never see John screaming or getting in his grill or anything like that,” Critchett said. “I just don’t think that’s the way they are with each other. Over all, it’s a very professional relationship.”Jack said his father never pushed him to play football.“He just kind of threw it out there,” Jack said. “I was the one who accepted it. I tried it. I loved it. That’s why I play it.”Jack beat out a senior for the starting job last year. The Bruins went 6-5 and reached the playoffs, where they lost to Arvada West in the first round.Critchett said the team never was used to the spotlight that came with having an icon’s son under center and a Hall of Famer in the stands.“There’s always some intrigue there,” Critchett said. “We’ve got a lot of kids back, so this year, with some of the interest in terms of John, I think the kids have handled it really well.”'"
"'07-08-31,'1','But the proliferation of bundlers, and the ambitious fund-raising goals set out for them by cash-hungry campaigns, has opened the door to a host of embarrassing entanglements, including Mrs. Clinton’s ties to Mr. Hsu and President Bush’s connections to the jailed lobbyist Jack Abramoff.Although Mr. Hsu is wanted for arrest because he failed to appear in court for a fraud case 15 years ago, he has not been accused of other wrongdoing. His lawyer has denied any campaign finance violations.Still, by outsourcing the solicitation of individual donors to an ad hoc assemblage of the self-interested and the idealistic, the system has exposed campaigns to new risks.It is harder for campaigns to be sure bundlers do not bring in money from illegal contributors.And, campaign lawyers say it is virtually impossible for campaigns to ensure that wealthy bundlers are not, in effect, underwriting contributions from employees, friends or family.Lawrence E. Bathgate II, a New Jersey lawyer who is a former Republican National Committee chairman and a bundler for Senator John McCain of Arizona, said campaigns were forced to rely on the judgments of surrogates.“No candidates can know everybody who is out there raising funds for them,” Mr. Bathgate said. “They have to rely on the person who is part of their team, to make sure that person is being very judicious.”Mrs. Clinton, of New York, is hardly the only current presidential candidate with a bundler who has had trouble with the law. Of the more than 500 bundlers recognized by Mr. Bush’s presidential campaigns, about a dozen have come under investigation for legal violations related to their business dealings. One was Mr. Abramoff, who is serving a prison sentence for bribery.Another was Thomas Noe, an Ohio bundler, who pleaded guilty to embezzling state money and illegally laundering contributions through his employees.Mitt Romney’s campaign for the Republican presidential nomination primary recently returned a $2,300 contribution from Alan B. Fabian, a Maryland bundler indicted on fraud and money laundering charges. The campaign has retained contributions Mr. Fabian solicited on its behalf.Last week, Geoffrey Fieger, a lawyer best known for representing Dr. Jack Kevorkian in his trial for assisting suicides, was indicted on charges of illegally funneling more than $125,000 to the 2004 Democratic presidential campaign of John Edwards through straw donors.Senator Barack Obama of Illinois, another Democratic contender, has given to charity more than $32,000 raised for his Senate campaigns and political action committee by Antoin Rezko, a bundler who was indicted last fall on charges of influence peddling at the Illinois Statehouse and fraud in business.What is more, although it is illegal for a bundler to reimburse a contributor, bundlers often ask for contributions from people on their payroll. All the campaigns have reported concentrations of contributions from employees of companies where a top executive is a bundler. And it is standard practice for bundlers to encourage their lawyers, accountants, business partners and family members to make contributions.“I have my own list of people who will help me raise money for a candidate because of some connection to me,” said Mr. Bathgate, a lawyer and developer. “They may have companies with whom I spent a lot of money in the last 12 months through some business venture, or it may be an old deal partner of mine who will run around his house and bundle 10 grand because he made a lot of money in deals with me over the years.”Sometimes, he said, “I tell them I need you to do this and I will get their check and their wife’s check and their son’s check and their son-in-law’s check and I will have a FedEx package by the end of the week.”Laura MacCleery, who tracks presidential bundling for the advocacy group Public Citizen, argued that the “give and take” undermined the idea that political donations were a form of personal expression — a notion at the heart of Supreme Court decisions on campaign finance.“That is why it feels wrong even when it is not technically illegal,” Ms. MacCleery said.'"
"'07-08-31,'1','He called for Congress to act quickly.“The recent disturbances in the subprime mortgage industry are modest — they’re modest in relation to the size of our economy,” Mr. Bush said this morning. “But if your family is — if your family’s one of those having trouble making the monthly payments, this problem doesn’t seem modest at all.”The main objective of the package, one senior official said, is not to affect the stock markets but to help low-income homeowners, many of them concentrated in certain neighborhoods in several distressed areas of the country, such as Ohio and Michigan.“The primary focus is to help individuals who have an opportunity to stay in their homes to stay in their homes,” this official said. “The subprime mortgage situation is having a crushing effect on a lot of communities right now.”Administration officials, who asked not to be identified, briefed a handful of news organizations on the proposals on Thursday evening. Despite the assertion that affecting the markets is not the goal, one administration official said concern about Wall Street’s reaction did affect the timing of the briefing. He said there was a fear that if the White House announced in the morning that Mr. Bush would be making an announcement on housing, there could be confusion as buyers and sellers of mortgage securities guessed what the announcement would be.But secondarily, this official said, helping homeowners keep their homes and refinance or renegotiate the terms of the mortgages could have a stabilizing effect on the financial institutions that have these mortgages in their portfolios, and help them write down the value of the mortgages or sell them off at a loss.“You can’t solve the problems in the financial markets unless you can make some progress on the retail end of it,” said this official. “This is also a step to get banks to start loaning again.”Another factor in the decision to disclose details ahead of time was that Ben S. Bernanke, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, was planning to give a speech on housing this morning at the Fed’s annual conference in Jackson Hole, Wyo., and that speculation about his comments would also unsettle the markets.As they put together the proposals, top administration officials consulted with financial institutions, some members of Congress, housing counseling groups, academic specialists, and also with Mr. Bernanke.Several other steps the administration plans to announce involve seeking legislative changes. Mr. Bush, for example, is expected to endorse proposals backed by Democrats in Congress that would raise the ceiling on the amount of a mortgage that can be refinanced with federal insurance.He is also expected to support legislation that would provide tax breaks to homeowners whose mortgage debt is forgiven, in whole or in part, by lenders. The federal government currently collects taxes on the amount of a loan that is forgiven.Democratic presidential candidates and Congressional leaders have hammered the administration in recent weeks, charging Mr. Bush with indifference to the plight of an estimated two million homeowners whose mortgage costs are expected to go up in the next year and a half.These two million mortgages, all held by homeowners with credit problems and with homes that are declining in value, are valued at $500 billion to $600 billion, administration officials said. The total value of American mortgages is about $10 trillion.Many of these homeowners are lower-income families caught in the squeeze of variable-rate mortgages whose cost is expected to soar in coming weeks and months. With their home values declining, many are considered likely to default, possibly adding to the global turmoil in the financial markets. The administration officials who briefed reporters sought to underscore Mr. Bush’s willingness to work with Democrats, an unusual display of bipartisanship from an administration that has tangled with Democrats on many economic and budget issues.The administration’s legislative proposals are likely to be similar to bills that Congressional Democrats have proposed, but there is still room for considerable argument over details. In general, the administration wants home buyers to pay for any measure that might help them, and Democrats want measures that provide extra help to people with low or moderate incomes.But administration officials said they would continue to oppose one measure that Democrats strongly endorse: an increase in the total dollar value of mortgages that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the government-sponsored housing-finance companies, can hold in their investment portfolios.Until now, Mr. Bush and his top economic advisers, particularly Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr., have focused on the broad prospects of the American and global economies and the disarray in financial markets.Two weeks ago, when asked about the problems of mortgage holders, Mr. Bush said that many Americans struggling with their mortgages had failed to read the fine print on the loans.But some in the administration and some Republicans are also concerned that there has not been enough talk from Mr. Bush about lower-income homeowners. These Republicans have said the administration’s response so far is reminiscent of its initial delays in relief after Hurricane Katrina two years ago.The plans to be outlined by Mr. Bush are to be in the form of administrative actions taken unilaterally and proposals for enactment by Congress, many of them already in various bills sponsored by leading Democrats.Among the Democrats with such proposals are Representative Barney Frank of Massachusetts, who is chairman of the House Financial Services Committee; Senator Christopher J. Dodd of Connecticut, chairman of the Senate Banking Committee; and Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York, chairman of the Joint Economic Committee.One senior official said, however, that the administration would encourage Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to help low-income holders of subprime mortgages refinance or renegotiate the loans, rather than lifting the companies’ investment limits.Mr. Frank has said that the administration is ideologically opposed to letting the two mortgage agencies play a role in assisting homeowners in the current crisis, but the administration official said that was a misconception.Mr. Bush also plans to enlist Mr. Paulson and Alphonso R. Jackson, the secretary of housing and urban development, to consider regulating home-lending practices in the future to crack down on predatory practices. In addition, they are to study the role of credit-rating agencies, some of which have been accused of giving unrealistically positive ratings to packages of mortgages, which were then acquired by hedge funds and other institutions.One official said the administration’s proposals would not include a bailout of institutions that bought mortgages that have plummeted in value.“We are not using the b-word,” he said, referring to the talk of bailing out lenders.One economist said the efforts seem well intentioned. The F.H.A. can help provide another option to homeowners who need to refinance, and the government should do what it can to encourage mortgage companies to modify loans, rather than foreclosing on them.The administration could also help homeowners in higher-priced markets by temporarily raising the $417,000 limit on loans that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac can buy from mortgage companies, said the economist, Thomas Davidoff, an assistant professor at the Haas School of Business at the University of California, Berkeley.But he noted all the efforts would likely only have a limited impact, given the number of loans resetting to higher interest rates in the coming months.“This is helpful. But you had millions of people taking loans they should not have been taking, and investors lending money at too low interest rates,” Mr. Davidoff said. “Nothing is going to make those bad decisions go away.”'"
"'07-08-31,'1','“Well, hopefully we will get a win Friday night, but this time of year, you certainly do start getting excited about the regular season,” quarterback Peyton Manning said.The Bengals (0-3) are not much different.Their offense finally started rolling last Monday night in Atlanta, reaching the end zone for the first time in the preseason. With only three days off between games, there is no need to push anybody.Although Bengals Coach Marvin Lewis will not say, it is likely that the starters will play the first series and then start exchanging helmets for baseball caps.“There are things we can clean up and that we need to clean up before we get to our opener, but it’s all things we’re capable of doing,” quarterback Carson Palmer said. “We’ll get them taken care of.”One of the Colts’ interests for the final preseason game revolves around two draft picks. The fourth-round defensive back Brannon Condren and the fifth-round defensive back Michael Coe could get into the game at some point.Condren has missed the preseason with a groin injury. Coe has not played since the first game against Dallas because of a groin injury. Each was doing much better this week.The Bengals say they are curious how their two offensive tackles are doing with little more than a week left before the season opener.Left tackle Levi Jones played Monday night in Atlanta, his first appearance of the preseason. Jones has been recovering from knee surgery that sidelined him for most of training camp.Right tackle Willie Anderson returned to practice Wednesday, but it was unclear whether he would get into the game against the Colts. Anderson, an 11-year veteran, has chronic pain in his right foot.Even if he is in the starting lineup in the season opener against the Baltimore Ravens on Sept. 10, he may not be in shape to play the entire game.“It’s going to take awhile for me to get back up to par,” Anderson said. “Marvin hasn’t told anybody what the goal is. We’re going to take it one game at a time.”The Bengals also will be taking a look at a new kicker, Aaron Elling. The regular kicker, Shayne Graham, bruised his right hip while helping with a tackle in Atlanta. On Wednesday, the Bengals brought in Aaron Elling to kick against the Colts, giving Graham more time to rest.If Graham has not healed in time for the opener, Elling could be his temporary replacement — provided he does well against the Colts.“If I do good and maybe Shayne is not ready, they feel comfortable,” Elling said.'"
"'07-08-31,'1','Thornburg Mortgage, a jumbo-mortgage specialist that was forced to stop making new loans, has sold $500 million of convertible preferred stock to raise cash.Thornburg said yesterday that the proceeds would help the company, based in Santa Fe, N.M., resume making loans and buying mortgage-backed securities. The sale was completed four hours after it was announced.Thornburg shares gained 65 cents, or 5.8 percent, to close at $11.81.“This should help Thornburg stave off some of the concerns about the viability of its business,” said Jason Arnold, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets.“I don’t know if all concerns are averted, given that there is a lot of turmoil in the market, but it is certainly a plus,” he said.The transaction follows the Countrywide Financial Corporation’s sale of $2 billion of similar securities to Bank of America last week. Mortgage lenders like Countrywide and Thornburg are turning to costlier financing after being shut out of the short-term debt market. Thornburg had to sell more than a third of its mortgage assets this month to meet obligations it could not refinance.While Countrywide sold its convertible preferred stock to Bank of America at a discount to market value, Thornburg set its conversion price at a 3 percent premium.'"
"'07-08-31,'1','BAGHDAD, Friday, Aug. 31 — Syria informed the Iraqi government on Thursday that it would start requiring visas for some Iraqis next month, Iraq’s Foreign Ministry said, a step that would reduce access to the last remaining haven for fleeing Iraqis.The Syrian foreign minister, Waleed al-Moallem, called the Iraqi foreign minister, Hoshyar Zebari, and informed him that a visa program for Iraqis would begin on Sept. 10, according to the Web site of the Foreign Ministry. Syria has been the only country accepting Iraqi refugees freely without a visa. Jordan does not require a visa, but largely closed its borders to Iraqis, particularly men, at the start of 2007.The beginning of a visa program in Syria could present serious obstacles for the American program to resettle refugees in the United States because Iraqis are required to be interviewed by American immigration authorities outside Iraq. The United States is considering Iraqi candidates for refugee status from countries in the region, but the overwhelming majority are in Syria and Jordan.The change, if put into effect broadly, could also present serious problems for Iraq’s poorest citizens trying to flee the violence and looking for the cheapest and most direct route out. Turkey and Iran require visas, as do Kuwait and Egypt. Some are extremely difficult to obtain.The Syrian program will apply to the spheres of commerce, economy and science, the statement said. It did not provide further details of which Iraqis would fall into these categories.Strained relations between the United States and Syria have already complicated efforts to assist Iraqis in Syria. Officials from the Department of Homeland Security have not been granted visas to Syria to conduct interviews of Iraqi refugees there, slowing the process of accepting Iraqis to the United States.'"
"'07-08-31,'1','H&R Block said yesterday that the sale of its subprime lending unit, Option One Mortgage, might fall apart as credit markets deteriorate.The company, which reported yesterday that its quarterly loss had more than doubled, said it planned to stop offering home loans through Option One. Block said it might sell only the loan servicing business to the private equity firm Cerberus Capital Management, which agreed in April to buy the entire unit.H&R Block is negotiating with Cerberus to waive some closing requirements and close before a Dec. 31 deadline but said there was “no assurance” any transaction would occur.Losses at Option One contributed to an overall loss of $302.6 million, or 93 cents a share, for the fiscal first quarter, which ended July 31. The company lost $131.4 million, or 41 cents a share, a year earlier.“The mortgage origination market is in the midst of the most severe dislocation that it has seen in years, maybe the most severe since the 1930s,” the chief executive, Mark A. Ernst, said in a conference call.Mr. Ernst said that Option One would stop mortgage lending regardless of the talks with Cerberus, but that the exit date was “fluid.” He said the servicing business remained “quite valuable.”A Cerberus spokeswoman declined to comment. An H&R Block spokesman, Nick Iammartino, said H&R Block’s banking unit would continue to offer higher-quality, prime mortgages.'"
"'07-08-31,'1','The chemical believed to be phosgene, which was used extensively during World War I as a choking agent, was discovered in a steel box last Friday by personnel cleaning out files and old boxes in a weapons inspection agency that is to be closed soon, said Ewen Buchanan, a spokesman for the agency.The substance, a colorless liquid suspended in oil in a container the size of a soda can that was sealed in a plastic bag, was unmarked except for an inventory number, and nobody knew what it was, Mr. Buchanan said. A check of records indicated that the chemical was phosgene that had been taken by United Nations inspectors in 1996 from Iraq’s chemical weapons facility at Al Muthanna, near Samarra.Tiny quantities of a second chemical, sealed in glass tubes about the size of a pen, were identified as nuclear magnetic resonance materials, which are used to calibrate chemical analysis equipment, according to United Nations officials. It was unclear yesterday if this chemical posed any danger.The inspection agency has 1,400 linear feet of inventory files and it was not until Wednesday — five days after the discovery — that United Nations officials found the inventory number and learned that what they apparently had was Iraqi phosgene, a volatile, highly poisonous chemical made of carbon monoxide and chlorine that in gas or liquid form can severely damage the skin, eyes, nose, throat and lungs or even kill victims.And it was not until late Wednesday that the State Department was notified. Word was passed then to the F.B.I. and the New York Police Department, which took action yesterday. Even as the joint hazardous-materials squad went to the United Nations to secure the chemicals, questions about a mysterious “nerve gas” in New York City were popping up at the White House and the State Department.President Bush’s spokesman, Tony Snow, said at a White House press briefing that the materials had been brought in by United Nations weapons inspectors long ago, and should have been sent to a laboratory.“These items should not have ended up, obviously, at the New York offices,” Mr. Snow said. “Normally they would be transported to an appropriately equipped laboratory for analysis. I’m sure that there are going to be a lot of red-faced people over at the U.N. trying to figure out how they got there.”At the State Department, Tom Casey, a deputy spokesman, noted that the United Nations Security Council had decided to shut down the inspection agency that dealt with weapons issues in Iraq. Mr. Casey also said the chemicals did not appear to pose any hazard. He said an investigation by the United Nations and the F.B.I. would look into “why these items were there, why they were there for so long, and verify that there are no other outstanding issues related to it.”The United Nations pulled its inspectors out of Iraq just before the American-led invasion in March 2003, leaving the search for unconventional weapons and the responsibility for disarming Iraq to the United States and Britain. A few months later, the Security Council voted to shut down Unmovic and remove its inspectors.While no unconventional weapons were found, Iraq under Saddam Hussein had extensively developed chemical weapons; phosgene and mustard gas were used in attacks against the Kurds directed by Mr. Hussein’s cousin Ali Hassan al-Majid, known as Chemical Ali for his role in gassing villages in northern Iraq.Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, spoke yesterday of a “potentially fatal chemical” at the United Nations. “The U.N. should know it’s a target,” he said. “They need to be even more careful than anyone else. The fact that a container of deadly poison from Iraq was found at the U.N. is a wake-up call that they better start living up to the higher safety standards of a post 9/11 New York.”Normally, chemicals taken from Iraq should have been taken directly by military transport to the Edgewood Laboratories in Maryland for analysis, and not brought to the United Nations headquarters, according to Ms. Okabe.Mr. Buchanan said the chemicals were found in a steel box 2 feet by 3 feet by 18 inches in a third-floor office of the inspection agency last Friday. There were no labels or markings other than a set of inventory numbers, he said.“It may turn out to be nothing, but to be on the safe side we have to consider the worst-case scenario,” Mr. Buchanan said. In any case, he agreed that the discovery was bizarre. Dangerous materials, he said, “shouldn’t have come here,” adding: “We don’t have any analytical capability.”'"
"'07-08-31,'1','It looked like a public relations coup when, on Tuesday, Verizon Wireless announced that it had signed an exclusive deal with the Universal Music Group to sell its customers ring tones from the catalog of Bob Marley, the famed reggae singer who died in 1981.But two days later his survivors decided to, as Mr. Marley famously sang, stir it up, announcing that they would file a lawsuit to block the deal.Chris Blackwell, a longtime spokesman for the Marley family, said by telephone from his home in Britain that he was originally approached by Verizon Wireless a few months ago and met with representatives of the company twice.While Verizon proposed the deal as a matter of simply licensing the music, Mr. Blackwell said, the family held that if the cellular company was going to provide the ring tones exclusively and use Mr. Marley’s image to its marketing benefit, it amounted to an endorsement.“It was not something we were willing to consider unless they were willing to view it as an endorsement,” said Mr. Blackwell, adding that along with securing a fee for the family, an endorsement contract would allow the estate to set parameters on how Mr. Marley’s image and name could be used. (The phone company is already using an image of Mr. Marley to promote itself on its Web site.)But rather than make an endorsement offer, Verizon went to Universal, a subsidiary of Vivendi, and sewed up a deal without the family’s blessing.'"
"'07-08-31,'1','In its report, released Wednesday, Human Rights Watch describes a situation in which hundreds of Hezbollah rockets were fired indiscriminately at targets with no clear military significance, many apparently aimed at civilian areas in northern Israel, killing at least 39 civilians.Such conduct amounts to war crimes, Sarah Leah Whitson, director of Human Rights Watch’s Middle East and North Africa division, said in a telephone interview. She cited more than 100 statements and communiqués issued by Hezbollah as evidence of intent to cause harm in civilian areas in response to Israeli attacks on civilians.“The fact that more Israeli civilians didn’t die is not a tribute to Hezbollah but a tribute to Israeli bomb shelters,” Ms. Whitson said. “The point we’re making is that even though they say ‘only 43 Israeli civilians were killed’ that doesn’t make it O.K.”Human Rights Watch says it plans to release another report next week outlining Israeli violations during the war.Even before Human Rights Watch released the report, Hezbollah began an orchestrated campaign to discredit the group and the report, with scathing, often personal, criticism of some of the researchers, saying they were operating “in direct collaboration with the enemy,” and were “equating the victims with the aggressors.” Human Rights Watch has often been criticized for being biased against Israel, though.The advocacy group was forced to cancel a news conference planned for Wednesday in Beirut to release the report, Ms. Whitson said, at the insistence of personnel at the hotel where it was to be held and after growing concern over threats of protests outside.“You can criticize us, but there is a difference between coming here with a decision to condemn and coming here to examine the facts objectively,” said Hussein Rahal, a spokesman for Hezbollah, in an interview on Thursday.Mr. Siniora and other members of the government joined in the criticism of Human Rights Watch, saying that it should have released a report on Israel first. Mr. Siniora’s office said in a statement that Human Rights Watch did not show “such vigor toward Israeli crimes committed against Lebanese civilians.”Officials at Human Rights Watch said they expected the report, one of a series of investigations into the war, to set off a debate. But they did not expect the reaction to be a concerted attempt to silence any criticism of Hezbollah.“We knew that we were putting on the table something people are uncomfortable talking about in Lebanon, which is that Hezbollah did some things wrong in the war,” said Ms. Whitson. “The point we’re making again and again is that civilians are universal no matter where they are or who they are.”But many Lebanese say the criticism of Hezbollah only served to open healing wounds.“When you hear Siniora, an opponent of Hezbollah, say something like that against the report you know that a line was crossed,” said Alain Aoun, a senior member of the Free Patriotic Movement, led by the opposition leader Gen. Michel Aoun.“It is like putting someone who committed one mistake and someone who committed 100 mistakes on the same level. The war wounds are still open, the massacres, the dead bodies, the huge losses are still clear images in people’s heads, and for that no one can accept that Hezbollah be put at the same level as Israel.”'"
"'07-08-31,'1','The backup quarterback Jared Lorenzen led the next seven drives for the Giants, culminating in 3 points. He completed 10 of 16 passes for 53 yards and was sacked seven times for 37 yards — meaning that, on 23 passing plays against a defense of reserves, the Giants netted 16 yards.But the stadium was sold out, even if it was not close to filled, for a game that the Patriots ended up winning, 27-20. In the preseason, tickets sold mean more than the points scored, because preseason games account for 20 percent of a team’s ticket revenues. And ticket revenues account for about 30 percent of the N.F.L.’s total revenues, now more than $6 billion a year.In other words, preseason games are worth roughly $400 million to the league in ticket sales. Add television revenue (which, during the full season, is more than half of the league’s overall revenues), concessions, parking and so on, and it is clear that tinkering with the preseason schedule could have a huge impact on the league.“That’s a significant chunk of your revenue to take away,” Mara said of any suggestion to deduct games. “That would be such a drastic change that I just can’t see the owners going for that.”Some have suggested that the N.F.L. scrap two preseason games for each team, and add two games to the 16-game regular season. When the league added two games to its regular season in 1978, it decreased the number of preseason games. Teams had usually played six. Since then, they have usually played four.Mara, who is on the league’s competition committee, said there had been no serious discussion by the committee or among owners as a whole to alter the preseason. That includes swapping preseason games for more regular-season ones.“You increase the chances of more injuries if you do that,” Mara said. “At least in the preseason games — in three out of the four, anyway — your regulars are usually not playing much beyond the beginning of the second quarter. If you add two regular-season games, they would be playing the whole games.”The obvious counterpunch is that fans are paying to watch games often devoid of star power and short on name recognition, where the final score has little or no meaning.Giants Coach Tom Coughlin declined to take part in the discussion, knowing that he has little say in the matter. Opinions of players usually depend on their role in the roster’s hierarchy. Starters want some game action to get into a rhythm with teammates, but fear getting hurt. The lower-echelon players want more time to prove themselves, and see more reward than risk.“If I was king for a day, I’d probably keep four preseason games but try to shorten training camp,” the Giants’ starting center, Shaun O’Hara, said.That probably has a better chance of happening than decreasing the number of games, or shifting them to the regular season.“I think it’s an issue that has to be addressed,” Mara said of the preseason. “I’m just not sure there’s any clear-cut answer. There’s no way that you’d give up one or two games, revenue-wise. It would hurt many teams, including us. It’s too much to do that. So I’m not sure what the answer is.”The Giants (1-3) had no news on Michael Strahan, who told General Manager Jerry Reese on Tuesday that he would decide in a couple of days whether he would retire or play a 15th season. A voicemail message for Strahan’s agent, Tony Agnone, was not returned. ... Eli Manning completed 5 of 8 passes for 58 yards. Tight end Jeremy Shockey caught four of them, for 47 yards. ... When the Giants allowed a 13-play, 87-yard touchdown drive in the second quarter, the defense was using a few first-teamers, including safeties Gibril Wilson and James Butler and linebacker Mathias Kiwanuka. ... In their only field-goal attempts, Josh Huston made a 33-yarder, and Lawrence Tynes made one from 43 yards. ... The backup left tackle Guy Whimper sustained an ankle injury and walked out of the locker room in a boot. ... Receiver Plaxico Burress (back), linebacker Kawika Mitchell (groin) and cornerback Sam Madison (hamstring) missed the game.'"

"'07-08-31,'1','Allegations of police brutality, Ms. Edmonson said on Thursday, “have been a dirty little secret in this community for a long time.”The complaints come from men and women of all ages and races, with a disproportionate number from black and Hispanic residents, Ms. Edmonson said, adding that most accuse the police not only of excessive force, but also of using racial slurs and other derogatory language.Professor McLaughlin also noted that the Police Department’s roster does not reflect the face of this city of 200,000, where half of the residents are white, one-quarter are Hispanic and about 16 percent are black, census statistics show. According to the department, about 8 percent of the city’s 650 officers are Hispanic and 5 percent are black.“I don’t want to suggest that just because you don’t have a diverse police force you are sure to have more allegations of abuse,” Mr. McLaughlin said. “But certainly there’s the perception issue.”Justice Department officials have not disclosed what prompted their inquiry, but a letter mailed to city leaders on Aug. 22 says the investigation will seek to establish if there are “systemic violations” of the law in the use of force by Yonkers police officers.Mayor Amicone, a Republican running for re-election in November, said complaints of excessive use of force are too few to indicate a pattern of misconduct. According to police statistics, from Jan. 1 to July 31 officers answered about 94,000 calls for service and were the subject of 23 complaints; last year, they responded to 162,000 calls and received 34 use-of-force complaints.The mayor said 75 percent of the people who have filed complaints have criminal records, which he described as “more than just a coincidence.”“When it’s all said and done, these federal investigators will be able to verify what we’ve been saying all along: We have a Police Department that, under tough conditions, does a very good job,” the mayor said in an interview. “There’s no misconduct among our police officers.”Katrina Phillips, who lives in Yonkers and is a coordinator for the National Action Network, the Rev. Al Sharpton’s civil rights organization, said many people may have had problems with the police but did not file complaints for fear of reprisal.“I think there’s a reluctance from the part of many residents to file complaints with a Police Department that they feel has abused them in the first place,” Ms. Phillips said. “What we’re seeing now is just the tip of the iceberg.”The city’s police commissioner, Edmund Hartnett, said he had added two new officers to the department’s internal-affairs division since his appointment last November, bringing the total number in the unit to seven. He also plans to move the unit outside of police headquarters and into a police building that houses the community police team.Further, Commissioner Hartnett said, the Police Department has instituted a new complaint procedure: Instead of having to pick up a complaint form from an officer at a police precinct house, residents can download the forms from the department’s Web site or report potential misconduct through a 24-hour telephone hot line.“We thought we could make the process more credible and more user-friendly that way,” the commissioner said.He added that one of his priorities going forward is to address the racial disparity within the department, “if not to correct it, at least to make it better.”'"
"'07-08-31,'1','WASHINGTON, Aug. 30 (Bloomberg News) — Microsoft said Thursday that it had settled an eight-year patent dispute that resulted in a $521 million jury verdict against it. Terms of the accord were not disclosed.The dispute centered on a feature within Microsoft’s Internet Explorer Web browser that allows embedded links. The patent is owned by the University of California and licensed to Eolas Technologies, a closely held company formed by a university researcher, Michael Doyle.“We’re pleased to be able to reach an amicable resolution in this long-running dispute,” said Jack Evans, a Microsoft spokesman.In 2003, a Chicago jury said Microsoft had infringed the patent and awarded cash compensation based on sales of Microsoft’s Windows operating system. A federal appeals court overturned part of the verdict, giving Microsoft a second chance to argue that the patent is invalid because others had made the invention.A retrial in the case, scheduled to begin last month in Chicago, was postponed for a month. Microsoft said at the time that it was negotiating a resolution.'"
"'07-08-31,'1','Although the owner of the Indian Point nuclear plant says its new siren system works, federal regulators said yesterday that the plant had missed its third deadline for installing the system and could face fines. The old system remains in place and would be used in case of an emergency. The sirens are intended to alert residents within 10 miles of the plant of a major problem. The plant owner, Entergy Nuclear, said two days before the Aug. 24 deadline that the new system was ready, but it had not been approved by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission said yesterday that approval, which could take 45 days or more, was needed to meet the deadline. Jim Steets, an Entergy spokesman, said the company believed approval from FEMA would happen as “we were putting the system into place.”'"
"'07-08-31,'1','PARIS, Aug. 30 — WestLB, the troubled German state-run bank, said Thursday that it had lost more than $820 million on speculative trades in global stock markets in the first half of 2007 — pushing it into a net loss for the period and renewing pressure for it to find a merger partner.The bank, which is based in Düsseldorf, swung to a net loss of 170 million euros ($232 million) for the six months that ended June 20, from a profit of 136 million euros a year earlier.“Our profit has been severely hit by the losses incurred in our proprietary trading,” WestLB’s chief executive, Alexander Stuhlmann, said in a statement.WestLB’s stock traders lost money by betting, wrongly, that price gaps between common and preferred shares of certain companies would narrow. The substantial bets involved shares in companies like Volkswagen, BMW and Metro.Mr. Stuhlmann’s predecessor, Thomas Fischer, and the bank’s chief risk officer, Matthijs van den Adel, were forced out in July during an investigation by German financial regulators into WestLB’s trading practices. Robert Stein, who had previously overseen proprietary trading, left the bank last month.'"
"'07-08-31,'1','A $2 million lawsuit against the author Augusten Burroughs, by the family that sued him for defamation for his best-selling book “Running With Scissors,” has been settled, The Associated Press reported yesterday. Financial terms were not disclosed, but Mr. Burroughs and the publisher, St. Martin’s Press, agreed to call the volume a “book” instead of “memoirs” in the author’s note, although the word memoir will still appear on the cover and elsewhere, and to change the acknowledgments in future editions to say that the Turcotte family’s memories of events he describes are “different from my own.” In addition future editions will express regret for “any unintentional harm” to them. But in a statement released yesterday by St. Martin’s, Mr. Burroughs declared his work “an entirely accurate memoir.” Howard Cooper, a lawyer for the family, said financial terms of the settlement were confidential. Mr. Burroughs lived with the Turcottes as a teenager, and though the book calls them “the Finches,” the lawsuit maintains that they are easily identified.'"
"'07-08-31,'1','Andy Roddick, a former United States Open champion, and Donald Young, an 18-year-old junior whose game is catching up to the hype that has surrounded him, each caught a break Thursday at the United States Open when their opponents could not finish their second-round matches.Playing on his 25th birthday, the fifth-seeded Roddick lost the opening set against José Acasuso but was in control by the time Acasuso retired, 4-6, 6-2, 6-1, at Ashe Stadium. Roddick, who won here in 2003, was the runner-up to Roger Federer last year.“You know, one break,” Roddick about losing the opening set. “I had chances. I didn’t convert. Even after the first set, I wasn’t panicked.”Young, who holds a Nike endorsement even though he just won his first ATP match this summer, advanced without having to pick up a racket. His opponent, 13th-seeded Richard Gasquet, withdrew because of illness. Gasquet said he started running a fever Wednesday night.“Prefer to win it, but I’ll take this,” the 18-year-old Young said. “I was really surprised because I saw him in the locker room. A couple people saw him hitting today. I saw him hitting yesterday and the day before. I thought he was O.K.”'"
"'07-08-31,'1','Mr. Abe, who has cast doubt on the validity of the Tokyo trials in the past, avoided elaborating on his views in the Indian Parliament or during his 20-minute meeting with Judge Pal’s son, Prasanta. But the meeting’s subtext was not lost on some Japanese newspapers, which warned that it would hardly help repair Japan’s poor image among its neighbors.After the war, conventional war crimes by the Japanese, categorized as Class B and Class C, were handled in local trials throughout Asia. Twenty-five top leaders were charged with Class A crimes — of waging aggressive wars and committing crimes against peace and humanity, categories created by the Allies after the war — and tried in Tokyo by justices from 11 countries.It was not clear why the British and American authorities selected Judge Pal, who had served in Calcutta’s high court and strongly sympathized with the anticolonial struggle in India. As an Asian nationalist, he saw things very differently from the other judges.In colonizing parts of Asia, Japan had merely aped the Western powers, he said. He rejected the charges of crimes against peace and humanity as ex post facto laws, and wrote in a long dissent that they were a “sham employment of legal process for the satisfaction of a thirst for revenge.” While he fully acknowledged Japan’s war atrocities — including the Nanjing massacre — he said they were covered in the Class B and Class C trials.“I would hold that each and every one of the accused must be found not guilty of each and every one of the charges in the indictment and should be acquitted of all those charges,” Judge Pal wrote of the 25 Japanese defendants, who were convicted by the rest of the justices.Judge Pal also described the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki by the United States as the worst atrocities of the war, comparable with Nazi crimes.The American occupation of Japan ended in 1952, after Tokyo signed the San Francisco Peace Treaty and accepted the Tokyo trials’ verdict. But the end of the occupation also lifted a ban on the publication of Judge Pal’s 1,235-page dissent, which Japanese nationalists brandished and began using as the basis of their argument that the Tokyo trials were a sham.Takeshi Nakajima, an associate professor at the Hokkaido University Public Policy School whose book “Judge Pal” was published last month, said that Japanese critics of the trials selectively chose passages from his dissent.“Pal was very hard on Japan, though he of course spoke very severely of the United States,” Mr. Nakajima said. “All imperialist powers were part of the same gang to him. His attitude was consistent.”Casting subtleties aside, postwar politicians invited Judge Pal to Japan several times and showered him with honors. One of his strongest backers was Nobusuke Kishi, a prime minister in the late 1950s who had been a Class A war criminal suspect but was never charged. Kishi is Mr. Abe’s grandfather and political role model.“For us, we were extremely grateful for Judge Pal’s presence — there was no other foreigner who said so clearly that Japan wasn’t the only country that had done wrong,” said Hideaki Kase, chairman of the Japan-India Goodwill Association, an organization founded in part because of Judge Pal’s legacy.But Mr. Kase, who once served as an adviser to Yasuhiro Nakasone, the former prime minister, said that he disagreed with certain parts of Judge Pal’s conclusions, including his acknowledgment of the Nanjing massacre. Describing the massacre as a “complete lie,” Mr. Kase said that Judge Pal had fallen victim to “Chinese and Allied propaganda.”In many ways, Judge Pal seemed to share the mixed feelings that many Indian anticolonialists had of Japan. As an Asian nation competing with the Western powers, Japan inspired admiration, but also consternation for its colonization of Asia, said Sugata Bose, a historian of South Asia at Harvard.Mr. Bose said his great-uncle Subhash Chandra Bose, the Indian independence movement leader, criticized Japan’s invasion of China but allied himself with Japan against the British.“It is a complex view from South and Southeast Asia,” Mr. Bose said. “There is some degree of gratitude for the help that the Japanese provided, to the extent that such help was provided. At the same time, there was also grave suspicion of Japan.”Still, Subhash Chandra Bose and the Indian National Army, a popular armed force formed by Indian anticolonialists, accepted assistance from Japan.“Judge Pal, as an Indian, would have known all about this,” Mr. Bose said. “And it may have indirectly influenced his views.”'"
